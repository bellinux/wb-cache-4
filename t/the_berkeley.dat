5|$|In 2003, Gordon Ramsay Holdings {{took over}} {{location}} {{was used to}} be used by the restaurant Vong at <b>The</b> <b>Berkeley</b> hotel in Knightsbridge, London. Ramsay signalled his intention to move Wareing and Pétrus into the location after the arrangements between chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten and the Savoy Group were not renewed. This resulted in both restaurants at <b>The</b> <b>Berkeley</b> coming under Ramsay's control. The restaurant was one of those run by Ramsay that he imposed a smoking ban in from 2004 onwards.|$|E
5|$|It {{is now in}} {{its third}} location, and used to be located in St James's Street, London, and <b>The</b> <b>Berkeley</b> hotel, where it was run by head chef Wareing. By the time Pétrus' lease ran out in September 2008, it held two Michelin stars under Wareing. This {{resulted}} in a public feud between Wareing and Ramsay as Wareing took over Pétrus' former location in the hotel, opening his restaurant Marcus Wareing at <b>the</b> <b>Berkeley,</b> while Ramsay retained the rights to the Pétrus name.|$|E

50|$|There are {{records of}} the de Olepenne family (who may have named {{themselves}} after the place) settled at Owlpen by 1174.

5|$|The Students' Observatory was {{constructed}} in 1886 on <b>the</b> <b>Berkeley</b> campus, with the original funds provided by the California legislature {{in order for the}} observatory to provide practical training to civil engineers. Very quickly, the Students' Observatory became seen as a training ground for students studying astronomy, so that they would be better prepared to go on to use the facilities at Lick Observatory. This contributed to the separation of the departments of civil engineering and astronomy in the mid-1890s, with the Students' Observatory becoming the home of <b>the</b> <b>Berkeley</b> Astronomy Department.|$|E

50|$|This descends from Sir Maurice Berkeley (by 1514-81), a {{politician}} who rose rapidly in the Tudor court. He came from <b>the</b> <b>Berkeleys</b> of Stoke Gifford, a cadet branch of <b>the</b> main <b>Berkeley</b> family, as a descendant of Sir Maurice de Berkeley (14th century), younger son of Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley. This Sir Maurice, before being killed at the Siege of Calais in 1347, had acquired Stoke Gifford in 1337, and founded <b>the</b> line of <b>Berkeley</b> of Stoke Gifford.|$|R
5|$|The cathedral has two {{unusual and}} often-reproduced monuments, <b>the</b> <b>Berkeley</b> memorials.

5|$|The {{preliminary}} {{results of an}} independent assessment carried out by <b>the</b> <b>Berkeley</b> Earth Surface Temperature group, and {{made available to the}} public in October 2011, found that among other scientific concerns raised by skeptics, the urban heat island effect did not bias the results obtained by NOAA, the Hadley Centre and NASA's GISS. <b>The</b> <b>Berkeley</b> Earth group also confirmed that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0.911°C, and their results closely matched those obtained from earlier studies.|$|E
5|$|These {{results by}} <b>the</b> <b>Berkeley</b> {{scientists}} did not confirm the JINR findings regarding the 9.4MeV or 9.7MeV alpha decay of 260105, leaving only 261105 as a possibly produced isotope.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, BART {{became the}} first transit system in the United States to offer {{cellular}} telephone communication to passengers of all major wireless carriers on its trains underground. Service was made available for customers of Verizon Wireless, Sprint/Nextel, AT Mobility, and T-Mobile in and between the four San Francisco Market Street stations from Civic Center to Embarcadero. In 2009, service was expanded to include the Transbay Tube, thus providing continuous cellular coverage between West Oakland and Balboa Park. In 2010, service was expanded to all underground stations in Oakland (19th Street, 12th Street/Oakland City Center, and Lake Merritt). Uninterrupted cellular coverage of the entire BART system is a goal. As of 2012 passengers in both <b>the</b> <b>Berkeley</b> Hills tunnel and <b>the</b> <b>Berkeley</b> subway (Ashby, Downtown and North Berkeley) received cell service. The only section still not covered by cell service is a short tunnel that leads to Walnut Creek BART, and San Mateo County subway stations (including service to SFO and Millbrae).|$|E
