5|$|Barium {{peroxide}} is {{a catalyst}} in the aluminothermic reaction (<b>thermite)</b> for welding rail tracks. It {{is also a}} green flare in tracer ammunition and a bleaching agent.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{chemical}} compounds have many uses. Iron oxide mixed with aluminium powder can be ignited {{to create a}} <b>thermite</b> reaction, used in welding and purifying ores. Iron forms binary compounds with the halogens and the chalcogens. Among its organometallic compounds is ferrocene, the first sandwich compound discovered.|$|E
5|$|Carbon, aluminium, {{phosphorus}} and selenium {{continue the}} theme. Carbon, in black powder, is a constituent of fireworks rocket propellants, bursting charges, and effects mixtures, and military delay fuses and igniters. Aluminium {{is a common}} pyrotechnic ingredient, and is widely employed for its capacity to generate light and heat, including in <b>thermite</b> mixtures. Phosphorus {{can be found in}} smoke and incendiary munitions, paper caps used in toy guns, and party poppers. Selenium has been used {{in the same way as}} tellurium.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the <b>thermites</b> systematically, six {{different}} <b>thermites</b> were chosen and prepared, then the thermodynamic properties were measured. It was found that Mg+MnO 2, Al+Fe 3 O 4 and Mg+CuO combusted steadily and slowly, while Mg+MnO 2 had a high combustion temperature; Mg+CuO, Mg+Fe 3 O 4 and Mg+MnO 2 had lower starting reaction temperature, higher releasing heat, and reacted easily; Mg+MnO 2, Mg+CuO and Al+CuO had higher combustion heat and complete combustion capacity. Mg+MnO 2 and Mg+CuO are two ideal <b>thermites,</b> have bright practical application prospect...|$|R
50|$|<b>Thermites</b> with {{nanosized}} {{particles are}} {{described by a}} variety of terms, such as metastable intermolecular composites, super-thermite, nano-thermite, and nanocomposite energetic materials.|$|R
50|$|In addition, super <b>thermites</b> {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to electrostatic discharge (ESD). Surrounding the metal oxide particles with carbon nanofibers may make nanothermites safer to handle.|$|R
5|$|At 19:30 General Carey {{directed}} {{that the}} remaining elements guarding the Annex be withdrawn to DAO headquarters (the Alamo) where {{the last of}} the evacuees would await their flight. Once completed, the new defensive perimeter encompassed only LZ 36 and the Alamo. By 20:30 the last evacuees had been loaded onto helicopters. With the evacuation of the landing control teams from the Annex and Alamo completed, General Carey ordered the withdrawal of the ground security forces from the DAO Compound around 22:50. At 23:40 Marines destroyed the satellite terminal, the DAO Compound's last means of direct communication with the outside world. At 00:30 on 30 April, <b>thermite</b> grenades, having been previously placed in selected buildings, ignited as two CH-53s left the DAO parking lot carrying the last elements of BLT 2/4.|$|E
5|$|Resistance welding {{was also}} {{developed}} during the final decades of the 19th century, with the first patents going to Elihu Thomson in 1885, who produced further advances over the next 15 years. <b>Thermite</b> welding was invented in 1893, and around that time another process, oxyfuel welding, became well established. Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by Edmund Davy, but its use was not practical in welding until about 1900, when a suitable torch was developed. At first, oxyfuel welding {{was one of the}} more popular welding methods due to its portability and relatively low cost. As the 20th century progressed, however, it fell out of favor for industrial applications. It was largely replaced with arc welding, as advances in metal coverings (known as flux) were made. Flux covering the electrode primarily shields the base material from impurities, but also stabilizes the arc and can add alloying components to the weld metal.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, August 21, a US patrol of two platoons of {{infantry}} and M26 Pershing tanks {{went up the}} road toward the North Korean positions. White flags had appeared {{in front of the}} American line, and civilians in the area said many North Koreans wanted to surrender. The US patrol's mission was to investigate this situation and to form an estimate of North Koreans losses. The patrol advanced about , engaging small North Korean groups and receiving some artillery fire. On its way it destroyed five disabled North Korean tanks with <b>thermite</b> grenades. The patrol also found a 37mm anti-tank gun, two SU-76 self-propelled guns, and a 120mm mortar among the destroyed North Korean equipment, as well as recognizing a large number of North Korean dead. At the point of farthest advance, the patrol found and destroyed an abandoned T-34 tank in a village schoolhouse courtyard.|$|E
50|$|A similar common term is propellant, which {{describes}} either a homogeneous or composite material that generates thrust upon combustion, but which may contain fuels instead of or {{in addition to}} the metals contained in <b>thermites.</b>|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{pyrotechnic}} or explosive {{applications for}} traditional <b>thermites</b> {{have been limited}} due to their relatively slow energy release rates. Because nanothermites are created from reactant particles with proximities approaching the atomic scale, energy release rates are far greater.|$|R
50|$|A {{pyrotechnic}} initiator (also initiator or igniter) is {{a device}} containing a pyrotechnic composition used primarily to ignite other, more difficult-to-ignite materials, e.g. <b>thermites,</b> gas generators, and solid-fuel rockets. The name {{is often used}} also for the compositions themselves.|$|R
5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{have either}} pyrotechnic applications or associated properties. Boron and silicon are commonly encountered; they act somewhat like metal fuels. Boron {{is used in}} pyrotechnic initiator compositions (for igniting other hard-to-start compositions), and in delay compositions that burn at a constant rate. Boron carbide {{has been identified as}} a possible replacement for more toxic barium or hexachloroethane mixtures in smoke munitions, signal flares and fireworks. Silicon, like boron, is a component of initiator and delay mixtures. Doped germanium can act as a variable speed <b>thermite</b> fuel. Arsenic trisulfide As2S3 was used in old naval signal lights; in fireworks to make white stars; in yellow smoke screen mixtures; and in initiator compositions. Antimony trisulfide Sb2S3 is found in white-light fireworks and in flash and sound mixtures. Tellurium has been used in delay mixtures and in blasting cap initiator compositions.|$|E
25|$|Along with sulfur and aluminium, {{it is an}} {{ingredient}} in {{a specific type of}} <b>thermite</b> useful for cutting steel.|$|E
25|$|Some {{specific}} reactions {{have their}} niche applications. For example, the <b>thermite</b> reaction {{is used to}} generate light and heat in pyrotechnics and welding. Although it is less controllable than the more conventional oxy-fuel welding, arc welding and flash welding, it requires much less equipment and is still used to mend rails, especially in remote areas.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Thermites</b> {{based on}} magnesium/Teflon/Viton, aka MTV-compositions, {{have been in}} use since the 1950s as {{payloads}} in infrared decoy flare applications. See also Countermeasures. Derived from the acronym MTV is the expression [...] "MTV-Flare" [...] for pyrotechnic infrared decoy flares.|$|R
50|$|Initiator {{compositions}} {{are similar}} to flash powders, but they differ in burning speed, as explosion is not intended, and have intentionally high production of hot particles. They {{also tend to be}} easier to ignite than <b>thermites,</b> with which they also share similarities.|$|R
40|$|Molybdenum and {{molybdenum}} oxide {{are used as}} components in pyrotechnic mixtures as fuel or oxidizer, especially in fast reacting <b>thermites.</b> Samples from molybdenum were investigated by thermal analysis and evaluated for the derivation of kinetic parameters for the oxidation and reduction {{in the case of}} {{molybdenum oxide}}...|$|R
25|$|As {{reported}} in David Kushner's Masters of Doom, when Carmack was 14, {{he broke into}} a school to help {{a group of children}} steal Apple II computers. To gain entry to the building, Carmack concocted a sticky substance of <b>thermite</b> mixed with Vaseline that melted through the windows. However, an overweight accomplice struggled to get through the hole, and opened the window, setting off a silent alarm and alerting police. Carmack was arrested, and sent for psychiatric evaluation (the report mentions 'no empathy for other human beings' and describes Carmack as 'a brain on legs'). Carmack was then sentenced to a year in a juvenile home.|$|E
25|$|In 100,000 BC, {{a flying}} saucer flies towards Earth, landing in Antarctica. In 1982 in Antarctica, a Norwegian {{helicopter}} pursues an Alaskan Malamute to an American research station. Upon landing, a Norwegian accidentally drops a <b>thermite</b> charge, destroying the helicopter. The surviving Norwegian raises a rifle at the station personnel and is shot dead by Garry, the station commander. The Americans send a helicopter pilot, R.J. MacReady, and Dr. Copper to the Norwegian camp for answers, but they find only a charred ruin containing corpses. Outside, they discover the burned remains of a humanoid corpse with two faces, which they bring back along with some video tapes. Their biologist, Blair, performs an autopsy on the corpse, finding a normal set of human internal organs.|$|E
25|$|Since the Norden was {{considered}} a critical wartime instrument, bombardiers were required {{to take an oath}} during their training stating that they would defend its secret with their own life if necessary. In case the bomber plane should make an emergency landing on enemy territory, the bombardier would have to shoot the important parts of the Norden with a gun to disable it. As this method still would leave a nearly intact apparatus to the enemy, a <b>thermite</b> grenade was installed; the heat of the chemical reaction would melt the Norden into a lump of metal. The Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bomber was originally equipped with flotation bags in the wings to aid the aircrew's escape after ditching, but they were removed once the Pacific War began; this ensured that the aircraft would sink, taking the Norden with it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thermites</b> have diverse compositions. Fuels include aluminium, magnesium, titanium, zinc, silicon, and boron. Aluminium {{is common}} {{because of its}} high boiling point and low cost. Oxidizers include bismuth(III) oxide, boron(III) oxide, silicon(IV) oxide, chromium(III) oxide, manganese(IV) oxide, iron(III) oxide, iron(II,III) oxide, copper(II) oxide, and lead(II,IV) oxide.|$|R
50|$|The {{material}} classes {{under investigation}} are <b>thermites,</b> intermetallic compounds, metal-polymer mixtures (e.g., magnesium/teflon/viton-like), metastable intermolecular composites (MIC), matrix materials, and hydrides. These materials must {{be strong enough}} to act as structural components, be sufficiently stable to survive handling and launch, to penetrate a target, and sufficiently unstable to reliably ignite on impact.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe paper {{proposes a}} new {{theoretical}} model based on {{local thermodynamic equilibrium}} enabling the prediction of gas generation during the reaction of aluminum-based <b>thermites.</b> We demonstrate that the model has the capability to predict the total pressure and its partial pressure components {{as a function of}} the reaction extent and compaction. Al/CuO, Al/Bi 2 O 3, Al/Sb 2 O 3, Al/MoO 3 and Al/WO 3 <b>thermites</b> are modeled and their capability to generate pressure compared. Simulation results are also validatedthrough dedicated experiments and showgeneral agreement beyond the state of the art. Mechanisms underlying pressure generation are detailed. A two-stage process for the pressure increase in Al/CuO reaction,also observed experimentally,is shown to be driven by oxygen generation as produced byCuO and Cu 2 O vaporizationthrough different kinetics. Comparison with experiment stresses the issue of the understanding of the complex chemical processes taking place during vaporization and subsequent gas phase reactions and the need to determine their thermodynamicconstants...|$|R
500|$|German {{positions}} at Dammstrasse, which {{ran from the}} St. Eloi road to White Château, in the X Corps area, fell to the 41st Division after a long fight. White Château was attacked by the 47th Division as it advanced to the first objective, covered by smoke and <b>Thermite</b> shells fired on the German positions further to the north, along the Comines Canal. The German garrison fought hard and repulsed two attacks, before surrendering after a trench-mortar bombardment at [...] The northern defensive flank was maintained by the 23rd Division, with an advance of [...] in twenty minutes.

40|$|New {{classes of}} {{reactive}} systems which {{are characterized by}} nanosized-scale and possessing extremely high reactivity, as compared to similar reactive systems with micro-scale heterogeneity, have attracted attention of researchers. In this review article, the recent developments and trends in combustion science towards the synthesis of nanostructured reactive systems are presented. The emphasis is on combustion of nano-structured reactive systems which includes mechanically induced composite particles, sol-gels, super <b>thermites</b> and multilayer nano-foils. Various applications of combustion synthesized nanostructured reactive systems are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} metal nanopowders or nanometals (mostly {{produced}} by electrical explosion of wires) usage in different energetic systems {{is carried out}} with the focus on nanometals combustion efficiency. Improved kinetic characteristics of chemically reacting systems (ignition, burning rate enhancement for propellants, explosives, and <b>thermites)</b> are typical for nanoaluminum, nAl. A weak correlation between nAl properties and the slow oxidation parameters was found {{as the result of}} a very wide scatter in powder characteristics. The burning rate enhancement was analyzed for nAl-loaded solid propellants. The most promising energetic systems are nAl-loaded solid fuels (HTPB-based, ice-based, etc.) with chemically inert matrices...|$|R
40|$|Sandia National Laboratories` {{semiconductor}} bridge, SCB, is {{now being}} used for the ignition or initiation {{of a wide variety}} of exeoergic materials. Applications of this new technology arose because of a need at the system level to provide light weight, small volume and low energy explosive assemblies. Conventional bridgewire devices could not meet the stringent size, weight and energy requirements of our customers. We present an overview of SCB technology and the ignition characteristics for a number of energetic materials including primary and secondary explosives, pyrotechnics, <b>thermites</b> and intermetallics. We provide examples of systems designed to meet the modern requirements that sophisticated systems must satisfy in today`s market environments...|$|R

2500|$|On September 22, 2005 Jones {{presented}} {{his views on}} {{the collapse of the}} World Trade Center towers and World Trade Center 7 at a BYU seminar attended by approximately 60 people. Jones claimed that a variety of evidence defies the mainstream collapse theory and favors controlled demolition, using <b>thermite.</b> The evidence Jones cited included the speed and symmetry of the collapses, and characteristics of dust jets. Later, Jones claimed he had identified grey/red flakes found in the dust as nanothermite traces. He has also claimed that the <b>thermite</b> reaction products (aluminium oxide and iron-rich microspheres) were also found in the dust. He called for further scientific investigation to test the controlled demolition theory and the release of all relevant data by the government. Shortly after the seminar, Jones placed a research paper entitled [...] "Why Indeed Did the WTC Buildings Collapse?"

50|$|The <b>thermites</b> are {{characterized}} by almost complete absence of gas production during burning, high reaction temperature, and production of molten slag. The fuel should have high heat of combustion and produce oxides with low melting point and high boiling point. The oxidizer should contain at least 25% oxygen, have high density, low heat of formation, and produce metal with low melting and high boiling point (so the energy released is not consumed in evaporation of reaction products). Organic binders {{can be added to}} the composition to improve its mechanical properties, however they tend to produce endothermic decomposition products, causing some loss of reaction heat and production of gases.|$|R
40|$|Aluminum {{nanoparticles}} are {{of interest}} due to the variety of their applications, including additives for plastics and powder metallurgy. They can also enhance the burning rate of propellants. Metallic particles in traditional <b>thermites</b> are in the micron size range. When the particle diameter reduces to the nanometer range, their reactivity increases by several orders of magnitude. Thus flame rates of 0. 9 - 1 km/s can be reached, while for micron size <b>thermites</b> {{they are on the}} order of centimeters or meters per second. Ignition delay time also decreases by up to three orders of magnitude. The two main continuum methods to study melting-related phenomena (like surface melting, size dependence of melting temperature, melting of a few nm-size particles, and overheating at a very fast heating rate) are the sharp interface method and the phasefield approach. The sharp interface approach fails when nanoparticles and solid-liquid interface radii are comparable with interface width and also when nanoparticles are overheated fast. In the phase field model, the interface between phases has a finite thickness in which physical quantities, such as elastic moduli and entropy, vary between their values in the adjacent bulk phases. An order parameter describe the material instabilities, such as the instabilities of a crystal lattice in solid-solid phase transformations, melting, fracture and so on. Phase field method provides smooth description of the phase interface, rather than discontinuous one. We developed an advanced phase field model coupled to mechanics to study melting in the region of metastability and complete instability of solid and melt...|$|R
40|$|Aluminum-oxygen {{reaction}} {{is important in}} many highly energetic, high pressure generating systems. Recent experiments with nanostructured <b>thermites</b> suggest that oxidation of aluminum nanoparticles occurs in a few microseconds.

In our model, electric potential solves the nonlinear Poisson equation. In contrast with the Coulomb potential, a "double-layer" type solution for the potential and self-heating leads to enhanced oxidation rates.
