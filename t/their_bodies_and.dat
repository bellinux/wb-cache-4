5|$|A hazard {{of flight}} for very small insects such as thrips is the {{possibility}} of being trapped by water. Thrips have non-wetting bodies and have the ability to ascend a meniscus by arching <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> working their way head-first and upwards along the water surface in order to escape.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mating}} season rival males may compete by wrestling, not by biting. Opponents attempt to subdue {{each other by}} intertwining <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> raising their heads high off the ground. Observers have on {{occasion}} mistaken such wrestling for mating.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{biochemistry}} is {{the study}} of the chemical processes used by plants. Some of these processes are used in their primary metabolism like the photosynthetic Calvin cycle and crassulacean acid metabolism. Others make specialised materials like the cellulose and lignin used to build <b>their</b> <b>bodies,</b> <b>and</b> secondary products like resins and aroma compounds.|$|E

5|$|All slow loris species {{produce a}} toxin in glands on {{the insides of}} their elbows. This is spread across <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> those of their {{offspring}} using the toothcomb while grooming. When threatened with predators, the Sunda slow loris can bite, roll into a ball exposing its toxic saliva-covered fur, or roll up and drop from the trees. However, the primary method of predator avoidance is crypsis, whereby it hides. The Asiatic reticulated python, the changeable hawk-eagle and the Bornean orangutan have been recorded as predators of the Sunda slow loris.|$|E
5|$|During the day, zebra {{sharks are}} {{sluggish}} and usually found {{resting on the}} sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins {{to prop up the}} front part of <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or when food becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|E
5|$|Early species had long, fully toothed {{jaws and}} long tails, while later forms had a highly reduced tail, and some lacked teeth. Many sported furry coats {{made up of}} hair-like {{filaments}} known as pycnofibers, which covered <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> parts of their wings. Pterosaurs spanned {{a wide range of}} adult sizes, from the very small anurognathids to the largest known flying creatures of all time, including Quetzalcoatlus and Hatzegopteryx.|$|E
50|$|These mole-rats {{also have}} long sensory hairs called vibrissae that {{stand out from}} the pelage (fur covering) over <b>their</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> hind legs.|$|R
50|$|They are {{considered}} sexually mature by 7.4 cm. Breeding males have a pinkish tint {{over most of}} <b>their</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> small bumps or tubercles on their head.|$|R

5|$|In 2003, Scottish {{scientists}} at the University of Edinburgh and the Roslin Institute concluded that rainbow trout exhibit behaviors often associated with pain in other animals. Bee venom and acetic acid injected into the lips resulted in fish rocking <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> rubbing their lips along the sides and floors of their tanks, which the researchers concluded were attempts to relieve pain, similar to what mammals would do. Neurons fired in a pattern resembling human neuronal patterns.|$|E
5|$|In the present, Fox Mulder and Alex Krycek {{return to}} the United States, but are run off the road by another vehicle. The assailants attempt to {{apprehend}} Krycek, but are severely injured when he emits a flashing light. The Smoking Man sees <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> orders their destruction. Mulder, who was knocked unconscious in the crash, awakens in the hospital. Dana Scully tells Mulder about Walter Skinner's condition, and says that an analysis of saliva has identified his shooter as the same person who killed her sister Melissa.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{constitute}} the phylum Porifera, {{and have been}} defined as sessile metazoans (multicelled immobile animals) that have water intake and outlet openings connected by chambers lined with choanocytes, cells with whip-like flagella. However, a few carnivorous sponges have lost these water flow systems and the choanocytes. All known living sponges can remold their bodies, as most types of their cells can move within <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> a few can change from one type to another.|$|E

5|$|The {{developers}} {{attempted to}} reach out to new audiences by distancing Lords of Shadow from previous Castlevania games, but kept some elements intact to not alienate franchise fans. For example, vampires and werewolves are recurring enemies in the game, but other existing enemies include trolls, giant spiders and goblin-like creatures. The enemies can be defeated for experience points, which can be used to purchase combos or to augment the player's abilities further. Lords of Shadow has large-scale bosses known as titans. The Combat Cross can be used to grapple onto <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> navigate them, and break the runes that animate the titan.|$|E
5|$|When {{meeting for}} the first time or after they have separated, {{individuals}} may greet each other by rubbing and sniffing their noses followed by rubbing their cheeks, moving their noses along <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> sniffing each other's genitals. They then may rub and press their shoulders against each other and rest their heads on one another. This greeting is usually performed among harem or territorial males or among bachelor males playing.|$|E
5|$|A test in 2001 {{showed that}} four jumping species take nectar, either by sucking free nectar {{from the surface}} of flowers or biting the flowers with their fangs. The spiders fed in cycles of two to four minutes, then groomed <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> {{especially}} their chelicerae, before another cycle. A more formal part of the test showed that 90juvenile jumping spiders, including P. fimbriata, generally prefer to suck from blotting soaked with a 30% solution of sugar rather than paper soaked with distilled water. The authors suggest that, in the wild, nectar may be a frequent, convenient way to get some nutrients, as it would avoid the work, risks and costs (such as making venom) of predation. Jumping spiders may benefit from amino acids, lipids, vitamins and minerals normally found in nectar.|$|E
50|$|Griseargiolestes griseus is a {{medium-sized}} damselfly, black-green metallic in colour with pale markings. Adults can be strongly pruinescent on <b>their</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> tail.Like {{other members of}} the Megapodagrionidae family it rests with its wings outspread.|$|R
50|$|Juveniles {{lack the}} typical red foot border and red {{triangle}} {{of the adults}} but have three dark grey stripes running down the dorsal surface of <b>their</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> have the triangular mantle shield outlined with grey.|$|R

5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80â€“200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} are apex {{predators and}} consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They {{play an important}} role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but particularly during the breeding season, American alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Male American alligators use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> are protected by their mother for up to one year.|$|E
5|$|At the store, SpongeBob and Patrick {{find the}} crown, but are nearly killed when the diver {{attempts}} to dry them out using a heat lamp. Their tears short-circuit the lamp's power cord, and its smoke activates the sprinkler system, reviving <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> the other dried sea creatures {{intended to be}} sold as souvenirs. As the sea creatures attack the diver, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown {{and head for the}} beach. Patrick inadvertently loses the Bag of Winds while attempting to use it, but David Hasselhoff appears and offers them a ride; Dennis catches up to them but is knocked by a catamaran back into the sea. Hasselhoff opens up his rocket launching pecs to shoot SpongeBob and Patrick back to Bikini Bottom with the crown.|$|E
50|$|Yellow-shouldered {{blackbirds}} {{engage in}} anting, a rare behavior only {{observed in the}} Puerto Rican tanager among West Indian birds. Individuals were observed applying Pheidole species ants to <b>their</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> feathers {{for a short period}} of time (8 minutes).|$|R
50|$|Adult birds {{coming into}} contact with the virus usually (but not always) develop {{resistance}} to it, but the virus is retained in <b>their</b> <b>body</b> <b>and,</b> in most cases, is excreted in feces and feather debris {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|R
50|$|They {{range in}} body length from 2.3 to 4.1 mm. Their eyes are rather large for harvestmen, {{and they have}} chelicerae that are longer than <b>their</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> even longer, slender pedipalps and long legs. The females are larger than males.|$|R
5|$|Common {{threshers}} are active, strong swimmers; {{there are}} infrequent reports of them leaping {{completely out of}} the water. Like the fast-swimming sharks of the family Lamnidae, the common thresher has a strip of aerobic red muscle along its flank that is able to contract powerfully and efficiently for long periods of time. In addition, they have slow-oxidative muscles centrally located within <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> a blood vessel countercurrent exchange system called the rete mirabile ("wonderful net"), allowing them to generate and retain body heat. The temperature inside the red muscles of a common thresher averages 2Â°C (3.6Â°F) above that of the ambient seawater, though there is significant individual variation. Unlike the pelagic and bigeye threshers, the common thresher lacks an orbital rete mirabile to protect its eyes and brain from temperature changes.|$|E
5|$|It {{seemed to}} the besieged Christians as if arrows were {{shot out of}} the sky to strike and humble the pride of the infidels who rapidly died with marks on <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> lumps in their joints and several part, {{followed}} by putrid fever; all advice and help of the doctors being of no avail. Whereupon the Tartars, worn out by this pestilential disease, and falling on all sides as if thunderstruck, and seeing that they were perishing hopelessly, ordered the corpses to be placed upon their engines and thrown into the city of Kaffa. Accordingly were the bodies of the dead hurled over the walls, so that the Christians were not able to hide or protect themselves from this danger, although they carried away as many dead as possible and threw them into the sea. But soon the whole air became infected, and the water poisoned, and such a pestilence grew up that scarcely one out of a thousand was able to escape.|$|E
5|$|On Omega 3 {{they find}} several {{original}} sets from Star Trek, {{and most of}} the original cast with <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>and</b> eternal youth. An energy being named Melllvar appears and explains that he became an obsessed Star Trek fan after watching the dumped tapes over and over again. Melllvar gives Nimoy a body, and orders the actors and the Planet Express crew to participate in a Star Trek convention until the end of time. Welshie is killed in a show of force to force their obedience. While Melllvar forces the cast to perform his fan script, Bender, Leela and Fry escape in the Planet Express Ship. Fry convinces the crew to attack Melllvar to save the actors, but Melllvar destroys the ship's engine as he drags it back to the planet.|$|E
