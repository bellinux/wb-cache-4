As he is reading <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> Playduck magazine, his armchair begins to quake violently and propels {{him out of}} his apartment building and into outer space; Howard eventually lands on Earth, in Cleveland, Ohio. Upon arriving, Howard encounters a woman being attacked by thugs. He defeats them using a unique style of martial arts. After the thugs flee, the woman introduces herself as Beverly Switzler, and decides to take Howard to her apartment and let him spend the night. The following day, Beverly takes Howard to Phil Blumbertt, a scientist who Beverly hopes can help Howard return to his world. After Phil is revealed to be only a janitor, Howard resigns himself to life on Earth and rejects Beverly's aid. He soon applies for a job as a janitor at a local romance spa. Howard soon quits and rejoins Beverly, who plays in a band called Cherry Bomb. At the club where Cherry Bomb is performing, Howard comes across their manager, and confronts him when he insults the band. A fight breaks out, in which Howard is victorious.|$|E

2500|$|Since September 2008, Bane has {{appeared}} as a regular character in the ongoing Secret Six series. In the first issue, Bane is depicted as a stoic devil's advocate for the group, offering alternative points of view for both Deadshot and Catman {{on the subject of}} love. He is later shown to have an almost father like concern for Scandal Savage's well-being. Although this is largely played for laughs in the early issues, the first arc's final issue displays the depth of Bane's affection. [...] When the Six are attacked by an army of supervillains, a wounded (and seemingly dying) Bane's concern for Scandal results in temporarily breaking his vow to never take Venom again in order to save her. Bane is later shown to have recovered from his ordeal, appearing in Gotham City with Cat-Man and Ragdoll in an attempt to stem some of the chaos caused by the apparent death of Batman. During the team's several escapades, Bane reveals both a deep respect for his onetime adversary and a painful yearning to assume the mantle of Batman, telling a trio of rescued citizens to tell people that it was the Batman who saved them. [...] Bane ultimately gives his blessing to Dick Grayson, praying that [...] "God help him." [...] Following a near-disastrous mission, Bane assumes leadership over the Six. His first act as leader is to remove Scandal from active duty, not wishing for her to be endangered. In <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> Secret Six, Bane's Secret Six and Scandal Savage's Secret Six finally square off against each other. Bane and Scandal engage in a one on one fight where he refuses to fight back until Scandal uses her Lamentation Blades to slash his throat. The card is ultimately used to resurrect Knockout.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a review}} {{on the current}} status of capsule {{endoscopy}} in the assessment of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin after initial negative upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. Relevant information was gathered from a Medline search of the English literature, previous review and original articles, references cited in papers, and by checking <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> appropriate journals. Based on the available evidence, capsule endoscopy, if done early in the course of investigation, can identify a bleeding lesion and thus direct subsequent test or treatment in about 60 % of patients. Consequently, resources can potentially be saved as unnecessary investigations, blood transfusions and hospital admissions can be minimized and early implementation of definite treatments will be possible. The best candidates for capsule endoscopy are those with ongoing overt obscure bleeding or occult obscure bleeding. Large prospective studies are necessary {{to assess the impact of}} capsule endoscopy on clinical outcome. © 2008 Elsevier. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{effects of}} {{increased}} intra-abdominal pressure in various organ {{systems have been}} noted over the past century. The concept of abdominal compartment syndrome has gained more attention in both trauma and general surgery in the last decade. This article reviews the current understanding and management of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome. Methods: Relevant information was gathered from a Medline search of the English literature, previous review and original articles, references cited in papers, and by checking <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> appropriate journals. Results and conclusion: Akin to compartment syndrome in extremities, the pathophysiological effects of increased intra-abdominal pressure developed well before any clinical evidence of compartment syndrome. These effects include cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal and intracranial derangement, reduction of intestinal and hepatic blood flow, and reduction of abdominal wall compliance. Although abdominal compartment syndrome is more commonly noted in patients with abdominal trauma, it is now evident that non-trauma surgical patients could also develop the condition. Early initiation of treatment for intra-abdominal hypertension is currently advocated {{in view of the}} possibility of subclinical progress to the full-blown abdominal compartment syndrome. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
