5|$|Julius Mutekanga was {{eliminated}} {{in the first}} round of the 800 metres while Abraham Kiplimo and Geofrey Kusuro similarly were unable to advance to final of the 5000 metres after finishing in a non-qualifying position. Jacob Araptany also did not progress to the final in the 3000 metres steeplechase while Kiplagat advanced to the later stages of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>event</b> before being disqualified for changing to the track's inside line after being knocked over by another athlete. Kispiro made it to the 5000 metres final as the slowest qualifier and secured a fifteenth-place finish, and took a tenth-position result in the 10,000 metres despite falling onto the track's surface. Thomas Ayeko finished in sixteenth in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>event.</b> Kiprotich won the men's marathon, securing Uganda's first gold medal since 1972.|$|E

5|$|An {{exception}} to this rule occurs during medal presentation ceremonies at multi-sport {{events such as the}} Olympics and Asian Games. As Hong Kong competes separately from mainland China, should an athlete from Hong Kong win the gold medal, and an athlete from mainland China win the silver and/or bronze medal(s) in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>event,</b> the regional flag of Hong Kong would be raised in the centre above the national flag(s) during the medal presentation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Athletes {{may have}} competed against {{individuals}} with different classifications in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>event.</b> For example, {{track and field}} athlete Jim Bob Bizzell competed in the men's 200meters T44; the prefix T designated a track event and 44 was the disability classification. Although he finished behind Oscar Pistorius (competing under the T43 class), Bizell set a world record in the T44 classification.

At the Newport Jazz Festival in July 1955 Powell played with Roach and others as backing for Washington.

Meanwhile, in the men's vault, three athletes finished in joint third place and so were awarded a bronze medal each, resulting in five medals being handed out for that one event.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 Australian Grand Prix saw {{the debut}} of several young drivers new to Formula One and a late {{replacement}} for McLaren's Fernando Alonso. Two weeks prior to the Grand Prix, McLaren announced that Alonso would miss the inaugural 2015 race due to a concussion suffered in a crash during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. Doctors advised Alonso not to race, avoiding further medical complications and his place was therefore taken by McLaren reserve driver, Kevin Magnussen who finished second on his debut at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>event</b> in 2014.|$|E

The teams (also known as constructors) were Ferrari, McLaren, Williams, Benetton, BAR, Jordan, Arrows, Sauber, Jaguar, Minardi and Prost.

5|$|The most {{important}} section of Eusebius' Historia on Philip's religious beliefs describes the emperor's {{visit to a}} church on Easter Eve when he was denied entry by the presiding bishop until he confessed his sins. The account is paralleled by Chrysostom's homily, which celebrates Saint Babylas, Bishop of Antioch, for denying a sinful emperor entry to his church; and quotations of Leontius in the Chronicon Paschale which describe Philip seeking penitence from Babylas for the sin of murdering his predecessor. Given the parallels between the accounts, most scholars believe that Eusebius, Chrysostom, and Leontius are referring to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>event</b> (or legend).|$|E

The car received an overwhelmingly positive reception by public and press, and a number of wealthy Jaguar enthusiasts handed over blank cheques to secure a purchase option should the XJ220 concept go into production.
