5|$|Further {{investigations}} {{were then}} performed in 1900 by Alessandro Barsanti, who uncovered the {{vertical access shaft}} leading to the burial chamber. Barsanti, seeing that several corridors and chambers were seemingly unfinished and that all were completely devoid of artefacts, deemed that <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> had never been used. Shortly after, in 19101911, George Reisner and Clarence S. Fisher worked on the site, excavating {{the north and east}} exteriors of <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> as well as the cemeteries surrounding it. The dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> as estimated by Barsanti, Reisner and Fisher differ greatly and even the numbers of subterranean galleries they report are in disagreement. Unfortunately, <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> lies within a restricted military area since 1970 and consequently no excavation has been undertaken there since Reisner and Fisher's superficial work, leaving the structures beneath <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> in doubt. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> is now sanded up, hampering modern estimations of its dimensions.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pyramid</b> {{does not}} have {{internal}} chambers, the chambers being located underground.

This {{is different from the}} 4th dynasty pyramids for which the entrance to the internal chambers is located on <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> side itself.

5|$|Khaba is {{commonly}} {{thought to have}} built the Layer Pyramid, located at Zawyet el'Aryan, about 8km south-west of Giza.

5|$|The Book of the Dead {{developed}} from {{a tradition of}} funerary manuscripts {{dating back to the}} Egyptian Old Kingdom. The first funerary texts were <b>the</b> <b>Pyramid</b> Texts, first used in <b>the</b> <b>Pyramid</b> of King Unas of the 5th dynasty, around 2400 BCE. These texts were written {{on the walls of the}} burial chambers within pyramids, and were exclusively for the use of the Pharaoh (and, from the 6th dynasty, the Queen). <b>The</b> <b>Pyramid</b> Texts were written in an unusual hieroglyphic style; many of the hieroglyphs representing humans or animals were left incomplete or drawn mutilated, most likely to prevent them causing any harm to the dead pharaoh. The purpose of <b>the</b> <b>Pyramid</b> Texts was to help the dead King take his place amongst the gods, in particular to reunite him with his divine father Ra; at this period the afterlife was seen as being in the sky, rather than the underworld described in the Book of the Dead. Towards the end of the Old Kingdom, <b>the</b> <b>Pyramid</b> Texts ceased to be an exclusively royal privilege, and were adopted by regional governors and other high-ranking officials.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, {{under the}} border edge {{of one of}} <b>the</b> <b>pyramids,</b> a natural lava cave was discovered.

5|$|The core of <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> is made {{of roughly}} hewn {{limestone}} blocks {{similar to those of}} the main pyramid. These were disposed in two layers and finally clad with fine Tura limestone which fell victim to stone robbers. Consequently, the poor quality pyramid core was exposed and degradated rapidly with only the two lowest layers of <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> still visible today.|$|E
5|$|The layer pyramid {{was first}} {{examined}} and its surroundings explored in 1839 by John Shae Perring. Soon after, in 1848, <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> {{was identified as}} such by Karl Richard Lepsius, who listed it as number XIV in his pioneering list of pyramids. Around 40 years later, in 1886, Gaston Maspero unsuccessfully searched for {{the entrance of the}} subterranean passages of <b>the</b> <b>pyramid,</b> which was discovered in 1896 by Jacques de Morgan.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pyramid</b> has a T-shaped {{substructure}} with a descending corridor {{leading to}} a chamber with a gabled roof.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pyramid</b> {{was then}} {{neglected}} until October 1927, when Cecil Mallaby Firth and the architect Jean-Philippe Lauer started excavating there. During {{the first season}} of excavation, Firth and Lauer cleared {{the south side of}} <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> area, discovering Userkaf's mortuary temple and tombs of the much later Saite period. The following year, Firth and Lauer uncovered a limestone relief slab and a colossal red granite head of Userkaf, thus determining that he was <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> owner. After Firth's death in 1931 no excavations took place on site until they were resumed by Lauer in 1948. Lauer worked there until 1955, re-clearing and re-planning the mortuary temple and investigating the eastern side of <b>the</b> <b>pyramid.</b> Research on the north and west sides of the mortuary complex was conducted starting in 1976 by Ahmed el-Khouli who excavated and restored <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> entrance.
