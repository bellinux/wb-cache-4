5|$|During the restoration, it was {{discovered}} that a long-standing ascription of the painting's date to 1883 {{was the result of a}} misinterpretation: the artist's original inscription of 1885 was painted in a fugitive red-lake pigment that had faded, and was mistakenly repainted by a conservator <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> date.|$|E
5|$|Each poem {{has five}} {{sections}}.

5|$|Lexical {{differences}} between dialects are often considerable. This is due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> cultural practice of imposing taboo on words which {{had served as}} names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many of these have changed their name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.|$|E

5|$|By 1912, the Cardiff Football Ground, as it {{was then}} known, had a new south stand and {{temporary}} stands on the north, east and west ends of the ground. The south stand was covered, while the north terrace was initially without a roof. The improvements were partly funded by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU). The opening ceremony took place on 5 October 1912, with a match between Newport RFC and Cardiff RFC. The new ground was opened by Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart. This new development increased the ground capacity to 43,000 and much improved the facilities at the ground compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> stands.|$|E
