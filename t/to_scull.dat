25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Rauschenberg unsuccessfully lobbied U.S. Congress {{to pass a}} bill that would {{compensate}} artists when their work is resold. The artist later supported a state bill in California that did become law, the California Resale Royalty Act of 1976. Rauschenberg took up his fight for artist resale royalties after the taxi baron Robert Scull sold part of his art collection in a 1973 auction, including Rauschenberg's 1958 painting Thaw that he had originally sold <b>to</b> <b>Scull</b> for $900 but brought $85,000 at an auction at Sotheby Parke Bernet in New York.|$|E
25|$|Rotation on {{the spot}} about a {{vertical}} axis is achieved by the helicopter turn: The diver bends the knees so that the fins are approximately in line with, but raised slightly above the body axis, and ankle movements are used <b>to</b> <b>scull</b> water sideways. The fin is rotated to maximize sideways projected area, then a combination of rotation of the lower leg and knee is used to produce sideways thrust. The fin is feathered to reduce drag for the return stroke. Thrust away from the centreline is more effective for most divers.|$|E

But, Taniel," [...] he added, in a more serious tone, [...] "we must hev one like this made for poor Tuncan." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{only chance}} of seeing, {{was during the}} flashes; and these left me almost blind. I had thrown the gang-board into the water, and I now called out to {{encourage}} the men, telling them I was in the boat. I could hear many around me, and, occasionally, I saw the heads of men, struggling in the lake. There being no proper place <b>to</b> <b>scull</b> in, I got an oar in the after rullock, and made out <b>to</b> <b>scull</b> a little, in that fashion. I now saw a man quite near the boat; and, hauling in the oar, made a spring amidships, catching this poor fellow by the collar. He was very near gone; and I {{had a great deal}} of difficulty in getting him in over the gunwale. Our joint weight brought the boat down, so low, that she shipped a good deal of water. This turned out to be Leonard Lewis, the young man who had helped me to clew up the fore-topsail. He could not stand, and spoke with difficulty. I asked him to crawl aft, out of the water; which he did, lying down in the stern-sheets.|$|E

5000|$|Akin to {{the skiff}} is the Yoal or Yole {{which is a}} clinker built boat used for fishing in the Orkney and Shetland Islands. The boat itself is {{a version of the}} Norwegian Oselvar which is similar to a skiff in appearance, while the word is cognate with Yawl. The French Yole is a leisure craft similar to the Thames Skiff and is {{translated}} as [...] "Skiff", while the French Skiff translates <b>to</b> a Single <b>scull.</b> In Dutch and German, [...] "Skiff" [...] also means a single scull, while Czech Skif refers <b>to</b> <b>sculling</b> boats in general.|$|R
5000|$|Better {{known to}} his friends as Wally, Kinnear was born in Marykirk, where he became a draper's assistant. He left home in 1902 for a career with the chain store Debenhams in London. Work colleagues {{introduced}} him <b>to</b> <b>sculling</b> and he became hooked. He first joined the Cavendish Rowing Club and in 1903 won the West End ARA sculling championship. He repeated this success in 1904 and 1905.|$|R
60|$|At length, he felt {{an elusive}} chill, and wiping his wet face, looked about. In the east, it was not quite so dark, and when {{he turned his head}} the yacht looked blacker and not so large. Hull and sails were no longer blurred; their outline was getting sharp, and he noted that the balloon jib swelled in a gentle curve. One side of his face got cold and when he began <b>to</b> <b>scull</b> again he thought the strain on the rope was less.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the tide had swept them beyond the breakers, and Weekes called on his companions to row for land. They were so chilled and benumbed by the cold, however, that they lost all heart, and {{absolutely}} refused. Weekes was equally chilled, but had superior sagacity and self-command. He counteracted the tendency to drowsiness and stupor which cold produces by keeping himself in constant exercise; and seeing that the vessel was advancing, and that everything depended upon himself, he set to work <b>to</b> <b>scull</b> the boat clear of the bar, and into quiet water.|$|E

I'll not {{complain}} of Sawney, who {{was kind enough to}} me as a shipwrecked mariner; for that was the character I sailed under, hermits being no way fashionable among us Protestants, though it's very different among them Catholic chaps, I can tell you. I happened to mention to a landlady on the road, that I was a sort of a hermit on his travels; when I thought the poor woman would have gone down on her knees and worshipped me." ...|$|E
50|$|Sculling {{is the use}} of oars {{to propel}} a boat by moving the oars through the water {{on both sides of the}} craft, or moving a single oar over the stern. By extension, the oars {{themselves}} are often referred <b>to</b> as <b>sculls</b> when used in this manner, and the boat itself may be referred <b>to</b> as a <b>scull.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Meanwhile, young {{delegate}} James M. Thomson of Alexandria (Senator Byrd's son-in-law) {{chaired the}} other new investigative committee, the Committee on Law Reform and Racial Activities (a/k/a Thomson Committee). Thomson's aggressive questioning of printer David H. Scull (a Quaker from Annandale) concerning a pro-desegregation pamphlet, led <b>to</b> <b>Scull's</b> being cited for contempt by an Arlington court, which the U.S. Supreme Court reversed in Scull v. Virginia ex rel. Committee on Law Reform & Racial Activities on May 4, 1959.|$|R
6000|$|For a few moments, I now {{heard no}} {{more in the}} water; and I began <b>to</b> <b>scull</b> again. By my calculation, I moved a few yards, and must have got over {{the spot where the}} {{schooner}} went down. Here, in the flashes, I saw many heads, the men swimming in confusion, and at random. By this time, little was said, the whole scene being one of fearful struggling and frightful silence. It still rained; but the flashes were less frequent, and less fierce. They told me, afterwards, in the squadron, that it thundered awfully; but I cannot say I heard a clap, after I struck the water. The next man caught the boat himself. It was a mulatto, from Martinique, who was Mr. Osgood's steward; and I helped him in. He was much exhausted, though an excellent swimmer; but alarm nearly deprived him of his strength. He kept saying, [...] "Oh! Masser Ned--Oh! Masser Ned!" [...] and lay down {{in the bottom of the}} boat, like the two others; I taking care to shove him over to the larboard side, so as to trim our small craft.|$|E
60|$|The men now hurried {{up to the}} ship, a {{post that}} Captain Truck {{declared}} he could maintain against a whole tribe, while Mr. Dodge began incontinently <b>to</b> <b>scull</b> the jolly-boat, in the best manner he could, off to the launch. All remonstrance was useless, as he had {{got as far as}} the bar before he was perceived. Both Sir George Templemore and Mr. Monday loudly denounced him for deserting the party on the shore in this scandalous manner, but quite without affect. Mr. Dodge's skill, unfortunately for his success, did not quite equal his zeal; and finding, when he got on the bar, that he was unable to keep the boat's head to the sea, or indeed to manage it at all, he fairly jumped into the water and swam lustily towards the launch. As he was expert at this exercise, he arrived safely, cursing in his heart all travelling, the desert, the Arabs, and mankind in general, wishing himself quietly back in Dodgeopolis again, among his beloved people. The boat drove upon the sands, of course, and was eventually taken care of by two of the Montauk's crew.|$|E
60|$|The {{captain and}} myself had been stowed under a half-deck, in the boat, {{but as soon}} as the money was found, the old Spaniard, who stood {{sentinel}} over us, was told to let us out, that we might see the fun. There were the eight scoundrels, paraded around the trunk of the schooner, dividing the doubloons. As soon as this was done, we were told to come alongside with our boat, which had been used to carry us to the piratical craft. The captain got on board the Sally and I was ordered <b>to</b> <b>scull</b> the rogues, in one gang, back to their own craft. The scamps were in high spirits, seeming much pleased with their haul. They cracked a good many jokes at our expense, but were so well satisfied with their gold, that they left the square-sail behind them. They had robbed the cabin, however, carrying off, for me, a quadrant, a watch, and a large portion of my clothes. The forecastle had not been entered, though the men had four hundred dollars lying under a pile of dirt and old junk, to keep them out of sight.|$|E

50|$|Sweep or sweep-oar rowing {{is a type}} of rowing when a rower has one oar, usually {{held with}} both hands.

60|$|There were no Malays here {{except the}} man at the wheel, and he was so intent on his work that he did not notice Van Houten as he crept past. He found the boat's rope, which was tied to the rail, and lowered himself till he was in the water. The boat was some ten yards astern, and, {{severing}} the rope, he was soon alongside her. Keeping his hand on the gunwale, he worked along it till he reached the stern; this he grasped and hung on. The boat soon lost her way, and the ship receded fast. He made no effort to climb into the boat until the latter had quite disappeared from his sight, for had he, in climbing on board, moved one of the oars in her, the rattle might have been heard by someone sleeping lightly on the ship. Once assured that she was well away, he cautiously raised himself and clambered over the stern, using the utmost care in each movement so as to avoid touching anything movable. He waited a quarter of an hour, then he crept forward; took off his coat, cut off one of the sleeves, fastened this round one of the heavy oars and put it out over the stern, so that the cloth was in the groove made for the purpose of enabling one man <b>to</b> <b>scull</b> her when near shore. This would prevent the slightest chance of the pirates hearing him at work.|$|E
60|$|As {{nearly always}} happens, {{it was less}} by school work or spoken {{addresses}} in juvenile debate, or early attempts in the great and difficult art of written composition, than by blithe and congenial comradeship that {{the mind of the}} young Gladstone was stimulated, opened, strengthened. In after days he commemorated among his friends George Selwyn, afterwards bishop of New Zealand and of Lichfield, 'a man whose character is summed up, from alpha to omega, in the single word, noble, and whose high office, in a large measure, it was to reintroduce among the anglican clergy the pure heroic type.' Another was Francis Doyle, 'whose genial character supplied a most pleasant introduction for his unquestionable poetic genius.' A third was James Milnes Gaskell, a youth endowed with precocious ripeness of political faculty, an enthusiast, and with a vivacious humour that enthusiasts often miss. Doyle said of him that his nurse must have lulled him to sleep by parliamentary reports, and his first cries on awaking in his cradle must have been 'hear, hear'! Proximity of rooms 'gave occasion or aid to the formation of another very valuable friendship, that with Gerald Wellesley, afterwards dean of Windsor, which lasted, to my great profit, for some sixty years, until that light was put out.' In Gaskell's room four or five of them would meet, and discuss without restraint the questions of politics that were too modern to be tolerated in public debate. Most of them were friendly to catholic emancipation, and to the steps by which Huskisson, supported by Canning, was cautiously treading in the path towards free trade. The brightest star in this cheerful constellation was the rare youth who, though his shining course was run in two-and-twenty years, yet in that scanty span was able to impress with his vigorous understanding and graceful imagination more than one of the loftiest minds of his time.[29] Arthur Hallam was a couple of years younger than Gladstone, no narrow gulf at that age; but such was the sympathy of genius, such the affinities of intellectual interest and aspiration spoken and unspoken, such the charm {{and the power of the}} younger with the elder, that rapid instinct made them close comrades. They clubbed together their rolls and butter, and breakfasted in one another's rooms. Hallam was not strong enough for boating, so the more sinewy Gladstone used <b>to</b> <b>scull</b> him up to the Shallows, and he regarded this toilsome carrying of an idle passenger up stream as proof positive of no common value set upon his passenger's company. They took walks together, often to the monument of Gray, close by the churchyard of the elegy; arguing about the articles and the creeds; about Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley; about free will, for Hallam was precociously full of Jonathan Edwards; about politics, old and new, living and dead; about Pitt and Fox, and Canning and Peel, for Gladstone was a tory and Hallam pure whig. Hallam was described by Mr. Gladstone in his old age as one who 'enjoyed work, enjoyed society; and games which he did not enjoy he left contentedly aside. His temper was as sweet as his manners were winning. His conduct was without a spot or even a speck. He was that rare and blessed creature, anima naturaliter Christiana. He read largely, and though not superficial, yet with an extraordinary speed. He had no high or exclusive ways.' Thus, as so many have known in that happy dawn of life, before any of the imps of disorder and confusion have found their way into the garden, it was the most careless hours,--careless of all save truth and beauty,--that were the hours best filled.|$|E
5000|$|Thomson's {{testimony}} in the contempt proceeding before the Circuit Court further muddied things.
