Since the nineteenth century, the former have been advocating sport as a means of character formation, social solidarity, and tension release, while the latter attempted to analyze and understand social behavior resulting from sport. <b>The</b> <b>physical</b> <b>educator</b> espoused the great benefits of athletics while the social scientist simply tried to understand it. Yet, few from either group have related sport to society in a unified consistent way; it is only recently that sport as a sociological inquiry has achieved some sense of a unified discipline.

40|$|The {{comparatively}} {{low level}} of the physical fitness of the youth throughout the United States {{has been a major}} concern for the past decade. Many social agencies have taken the initiative, proposed, and developed programs designed specifically for the purpose of raising the level of physical fitness as measured by specific tests. Since physical fitness is a unique objective of the school physical education program, this situation logically must be a prime concern to the educator and, more specifically, <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>educator.</b> <b>The</b> <b>physical</b> <b>educator,</b> however, is bound by his philosophy which prevents him from presenting physical fitness as a program and neglecting the other important objectives of his profession. Research, therefore, is needed in this area in order to provide reliable evidence on which to base further action and to give direction to those who are concerned about the contribution of the school physical education program to the physical fitness of the students. The problem here was to investigate to what extent a given basic physical education program would affect the physical fitness of 101 fifth and sixth grade students of West Ward Elementary School in the city of Wabash, Indiana, and to statistically test the significance of any changeof physical status. The program consisted of activities arranged in the categories of (1) group games, (2) rhythms, (3) stunts, tumbling and vaulting, and (4) track and self testing activities. It is anticipated that this research, by subjecting the results of this one type of general program to statistical analysis, will shed significant light on this problem. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The role {{of schools}} and {{physical}} education curriculum in the promotion of physical activity (PA) has been widely recognized {{in recent years and}} schools have been identified as an appropriate setting for the promotion of PA (Cale, 2000). Physical educators have the unique role of working with children in a physically active environment, and have been called upon to work towards increasing PA behaviors of children outside of the school-based environment. Thus, {{this study was designed to}} examine the factors associated with out-of-school PA promotion by physical educators. The purpose of the first study was to identify the predictive factors associated with physical educators assigning PA homework. The results revealed that the most important factors associated with physical educators' assigning homework behavior were (a) knowledge of how to assign PA homework; (b) teachers' attitude toward PA homework; and (c) expectations from significant others including; school administrators, parents, other teachers, and people of importance to <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>educator.</b> The second study tested a theoretical model of physical educators' intention and behavior promoting out-of school PA using a framework of the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The results of the study indicated that the importance of (a) knowledge of available PA programs for students; (b) physical educators' attitude toward physical activity promotion; and (c) subjective norm. It is recommended that physical educators have knowledge of local community-based PA programs and extracurricular-based PA programs. Physical educators also need to have an understanding of how to age-appropriate PA homework to their students. Given the importance of subjective norm including support from school administrators, parents, other teachers, and people of importance to <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>educator,</b> it is recommended that physical educators work towards gaining support from these people regarding PA promotion...|$|E

Individuals who were currently teaching physical education in public schools in Indiana completed the Computer Usage Survey on the web (N = 400). To determine types of technology used, potential uses for technology, difference in the implementation of technology by gender and teaching experience, usage of <b>the</b> Internet, and <b>physical</b> educators' attitudes toward technology, statistics including descriptive statistics, Chi-square (X), and One-way ANOVA were used (p <. 05). The results of this study show that <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> were more likely to use PC computers (both desktop and laptop) over Apple computers. Participant responses demonstrated a high usage of hardware devices such as Printers, hard drives, and CD drives, however, 5. 25 floppy drives, external hard drives, Hand-held computers (i. e. Pocket PC or Companion PC), Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), and smart boards were rarely used by <b>physical</b> <b>educators.</b> A significant positive relationship resulted between use of technology at school and at home. Significant differences were observed between male and female <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> in types of technology used and purposes for using technology. Use of technology was significantly lower in <b>the</b> experienced <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> group. Most of <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> use <b>the</b> Internet and they usually use it for research and teaching/assessment ideas. <b>Physical</b> <b>educators</b> in Indiana believed that technology has an important role and can enhance their teaching with implementation of technology.

40|$|Este trabalho de natureza qualitativa versa sobre a produção da prática profissional do educador físico no âmbito da assistência à saúde, mediante a implementação de uma intervenção de práticas corporais, permeada por ótica díspar de corpo (visão sócio-cultural) e saúde (Saúde Coletiva; Integralidade; Cuidado e Acolhimento). O trabalho foi desenvolvido na unidade docente assistencial CSEB-USP, âmbito da Atenção Primária em Saúde, com um grupo de pessoas heterogêneo, constituído por usuários e trabalhadores do serviço, selecionados aleatoriamente, pertencentes a diferentes faixas etárias. Buscou-se conhecer os sentidos atribuídos pelos usuários à intervenção e os reflexos da mesma para o respectivo serviço de saúde. A intervenção com os usuários teve como objetivo: o desenvolvimento da percepção corporal; o alívio de desconfortos, dores e uma melhor ütilização do corpon̈a vida cotidiana. Os resultados confirmaram nossos pressupostos iniciais sobre as melhorias relacionadas ao corpo e à saúde dos usuários do grupo de intervenção e revelaram outras possibilidades de ação do profissional da educação física na assistência à saúde. Verificou-se que há uma demanda de trabalhos com as práticas corporais no serviço público de saúde, para além da ação direta com os usuários. Sua atuação pode se estender para o desenvolvimento de atividades de consultoria e de multiplicação de saberes e práticas para as demais atividades do serviço, assim como, a partir desse, contribuir para a construção de ações direcionadas à comunidade e aos demais equipamentos da rede socialThis {{qualitative}} approach work {{deals with the}} production of professional practice of <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>educator</b> {{within the scope of}} health assistance, through the implementation of bodily practices, permeated by a distinct view of the body (socio-cultural view) and health (collective health; integrality; care and embracement). The development of this work took place in the CSEB-USP support teaching unit, within the scope of Primary Health Assistance, with a heterogeneous group of people, constituted by randomly selected service users and workers, from different age groups. This study aimed to know the meanings attributed by the users concerning the intervention and their reflection on the respective health service. The intervention with users had as objective: the development of body perception; the relief of discomfort and pains and a better üse of the bodyïn daily life. The results confirmed our initial hypothesis on the improvements of the intervention group users body and health and revealed other possibilities for physical education professional actions in health care. It was apparent that there is a demand for work with bodily practices in public health service beyond direct action with users. Their performance can be extended to the development of consulting activities and of knowledge building and practices to other service activities, as well as, from now on, contribute to the construction of actions directed to the community and to other social network device...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{aimed at the}} {{standardization}} of the motor subscales (locomotor and fine motor) of the Griffiths Test No II on preschool-aged children. A fundamental precondition {{for the application of}} a developmental test is its standardization on the population of the country where it is to be applied, so that one can determine, for every item, the developmental ages which represent psychomotor development. In order to standardize the A-locomotor and D-fine motor - or hand and eye coordination - of the Griffiths Test No II, 930 children were assessed (455 boys and 475 girls), aged from 37 to 72 months (3 - 6 years old). The children were selected from various areas of Northern Greece and from all socioeconomic sections of society, so that the sample was representative. Following the Griffiths Test standards, for each one of the three age groups - 3 - 4, 4 - 5, and 5 - 6 years old - a sufficient number of children that would represent each group (272, 326, and 332 respectively) was assessed. Based on each subscale, the developmental age, and then the developmental quotient could be identified. Therefore, there were two individual developmental quotients for every child (subscale A and subscale D). Through the statistical analysis of the results, the initial, middle and marginal age for each item of the subscales A and D was determined, as well as the percentage positions a) depending on the developmental quotient and the growth age of the child, and b) depending on the successful items and the growth age of the child. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>Physical</b> <b>Educator</b> can determine, through an easy method, the motor developmental condition. This is very important, because the motor development (locomotor and fine motor) of the child will determine the educational program based on which the child will be further educated. Moreover, the teacher can evaluate the visual and visual-motor perception of the child, which constitute fundamental elements for the development of mature movement. Through the present application of the Griffiths Test to the children in our country, we were able to realize that the average developmental quotients and the two subscales were higher compared to the relevant quotients of the Griffiths Test. This means that the children of the present study execute earlier, that is, at a younger age, most of the items included in the two motor subscales of the test. Some of the factors that can influence the faster development of the motor development are the following: the passage of time, which has a positive effect on the physique and the psychomotor development, regardless of the country where the child is growing up, the environmental and cultural differences among the countries, and the enrichment of the curriculum with more complicated and challenging activities, which would result in the better education and development of the child. According to the results of the study, we can conclude that the motor subscales of the Griffiths test offer the possibility for an objective evaluation of the motor condition, the rate of motor development, and the timely detection of a dormant deviation, without the need for time-consuming or special instruments. Moreover, through the great number of items that the test examines, we can identify the motor level in children with motor difficulties, and monitor the motor development of normal children and children with disadvantages after a therapeutic intervention. Finally, the higher developmental quotients of the children in this study fortify the need for the standardization of a test before it is applied to the population of a country, and its re-standardization on the population of the country where it was first applied. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{qualitative}} study investigates teachers 2 ̆ 7 experiences with mentoring programs. An interpretive paradigm was used. Four hour-long interviews were conducted, transcribed, and analyzed to examine mentoring experiences. Participants included one in-content mentoring pair (an early career physical education (PE) {{teacher and a}} veteran PE teacher) and one out-of-content pair (an early career PE teacher and a veteran kindergarten teacher). Guiding the research were the questions: What are <b>the</b> experiences of <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> with mentors inside their content area? What are <b>the</b> experiences of <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> with mentors outside their content area? Findings showed that mentoring is an important support to provide early career PE teachers. Mentoring inside of teaching content has many benefits and mentoring outside of teaching content has challenges. Informal mentoring can provide additional support for new teachers. A strong mentoring relationship depends on a quality mentor, compatible personalities, and frequent meeting opportunities for the pair...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of an {{undergraduate}} adapted physical education course on the attitudes of pre-service <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> toward individuals with disabilities. The participants for this study were 108 students enrolled in undergraduate adapted physical education courses at a faith-based university. <b>The</b> <b>Physical</b> <b>Educators</b> Attitude toward Teaching Individuals with Disabilities, third edition pre- and post-intervention was utilized to assess any changes in the participants’ attitudes toward individuals with disabilities. Statistically significant differences were found between the participants’ pre- and post-intervention attitudinal scores on all measured areas (i. e. emotional disturbance, learning disabled, mild intellectual disability, severe intellectual disability, and total). There were no statistically significant differences in attitudinal scores based on the gender of the respondents. There were no statistically significant differences in the attitudinal scores based on the respondents either enrolling in both the lecture course and the laboratory, or alone enrolling in the lecture course. The participants felt that by completing <b>the</b> adapted <b>physical</b> education course they were generally well prepared to work with individuals with disabilities. The participants also believed <b>the</b> adapted <b>physical</b> education course had positively influenced their views on individuals with disabilities. The participants generally did not believe that students coming from either a faith-based university were any more or less prepared to work with individuals with disabilities than students coming from a non-faith based university. While the results of this study are consistent with those achieved by other researchers and the Theory of Planned Behavior, the results did not support the idea of spirituality training positively influencing empathetic behavior. Attending a faith-based university did not have a negative impact on the participants’ attitude toward individuals with disabilities; this attendance also did not appear to have had a positive influence on the participants’ attitudes toward individuals with disabilities. By examining various factors concerning change in attitudes, future researchers may be able to determine additional methods for improving <b>the</b> attitudes of <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> toward individuals with disabilities and thereby positively influence the lives of persons with disabilities...|$|R
40|$|Sport {{pedagogy}} is {{a discipline}} aimed at providing scientific {{data on the}} education and training in the different contexts {{in the field of}} sport and physical activity: education, coaching, recreation, rehabilitation … Using traditionally descriptive, correlational and experimental approaches, it is focused as much on the main actors (participants and educators) than on contents or on curricula. Its main objectives consist to improve the knowledge and the field practice of <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> and their trainers. Most studies in sport pedagogy are conducted in the school context as physical education remains a central concern of researchers. Nevertheless, since two decades, the place of the science of coaching grows slowly while researches in leisure and rehabilitation are still quite rare. In parallel, <b>physical</b> activity and <b>the</b> fight against one sedentary lifestyle became really important in the preoccupations of most of the researchers. Moreover, two important concepts are developing nowadays: accountability and literacy. This underlines that <b>physical</b> <b>educators</b> are expected to meet the goals that modern society emphasizes: efficiency and effectiveness. Quality is now regularly identified as a priority or even a prerequisite. Current researches in sport pedagogy is become complex as they mobilize more and more often complementary approaches taking into account all the involved actors and environment.
