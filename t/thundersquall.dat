60|$|Then Captain Jim {{told the}} story--an old, old {{forgotten}} story, {{for it was}} over fifty years since Margaret had fallen asleep one day in her father's dory and drifted--or so it was supposed, for nothing was ever certainly known as to her fate--out of the channel, beyond the bar, to perish in the black <b>thundersquall</b> which had come up so suddenly that long-ago summer afternoon. But to Captain Jim those fifty years were but as yesterday when it is past.|$|E
50|$|The {{southeast}} {{trade winds}} {{of the tropical}} South Atlantic Ocean acquire heat and moisture traversing the warm Brazilian current offshore, providing moisture for this rain and <b>thundersquall</b> phenomenon. The Abrolhos squall typically occurs along Antarctic cold fronts penetrating into the tropics.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-Analysis of {{conventional}} data and of {{information provided by}} a number of the competing skippers yields an unusually detailed picture of environmental conditions during the Newport, R. 1. -Bermuda Yacht Race in June 1970. Sea-surface temperature data indicate the presence of a warm meander of the Gulf Stream just west of the rhumb-line course, a position intermediate between that of a warm meander to the west in May disclosed by bathythermograph observations from €he RMS Franconia and that of a warm eddy to the east in August found by a Naval Oceanographic Office survey. The fleet was harassed by two groups of severe <b>thundersqualls</b> during the night of June 21 - 22, {{in the vicinity of the}} warm meander. Even the anomalously high seasurface temperatures, however, were cool relative to the air in which the thunderstorms were rooted. The storms originated in the Chesapeake Bay area during the day on June 21, and they appeared, surprisingly, to gain intensity over the ocean after being cut off from their surface source of warmth and moisture. Offshore forecasts for June 21 - 22 took no specific account of the presence of the severe thunderstorm systems. On June 25, part of the fleet experienced an unexpected southerly gale just northwest of Bermuda. From the yacht data, it is found that the gale was attributable to a small cyclone that formed in an old frontal cloud band and moved northeastward, remaining undetected by the conventional data network throughout its life history. Analysis of the surface wind field suggests that baroclinic effects played only a minor role in the behavior of this cyclone, which at least ‘in some respects resembled a tropical cyclone. Study of the forecasts available at the time indicate that in neither case did small-scale convective activity have a significant direct effect upon the larger scales of motion...|$|R

5000|$|After {{completing}} his {{studies in the}} United States, he returned to an independent India and joined Hindustan Aircraft Limited, where {{he worked in the}} design department until 1954. In 1953, his expertise was sought in investigating the crash of a British Overseas Aircraft Corporation Comet aircraft, which had crashed in a severe <b>thundersquall</b> six minutes after taking off from Calcutta-Dum Dum airport (now Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport). In his report, he suggested that the elevator control system in the Comet operated with booster power with no feedback arrangement for pilot feel, and this {{may have contributed to the}} pilot over-controlling the aircraft. From this inquiry, two significant design changes resulted: all Comets were equipped with weather radar, and the [...] "Q feel" [...] system was introduced, which ensured that control column forces (invariably called stick forces) would be proportional to control loads. This artificial feel was the first of its kind to be introduced in any aircraft.|$|E
