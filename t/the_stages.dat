5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stages</b> were {{shortened}} {{so that no}} night riding occurred.|$|E
5|$|Each road stage (that is, all <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> {{except the}} team time {{trial and the}} {{individual}} time trial) included an intermediate sprint. This was {{a point where the}} leading riders in the stage were awarded points in the points classification and time bonuses in the general classification. Many of <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> also included climbs that were categorised by the race organisers according to their difficulty; the leading riders over each of these climbs were awarded points in the mountains classification, with the most difficult climbs earning the most points.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> {{itself was}} {{equipped}} with <b>the</b> most modern <b>stage</b> machinery then in use. The deck of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> had double-floors. Four spiral staircases surrounded <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> leading to four fly galleries. Scenery was raised and lowered by hydraulic rams under <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Nobody--on <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> we mean--ever {{has enough}} of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> child. Nobody ever tells <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> child to [...] "shut up" [...] or to [...] "get out of this." [...] Nobody ever clumps <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> child over <b>the</b> head.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> {{was shaped}} like a big flower and {{consisted}} of several elevators throughout <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> floor. Above <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> were six large contractible pieces that could come {{together to create a}} large ball over <b>the</b> entire <b>stage.</b> Above <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> in <b>the</b> centre, a large projector screen faced all sides of the area playing both live footage as well as video backdrops. There were also LED screens in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> floor.|$|R

5|$|Indian surgeon Sushruta defined <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> of slow {{poisoning}} and the remedies of slow poisoning. He also mentions antidotes {{and the use}} {{of traditional}} substances to counter the effects of poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Other annual sport events {{hosted by}} the city include the KL Tower Run, the KL Tower International BASE Jump Merdeka Circuit and the Kuala Lumpur International Marathon. Kuala Lumpur {{is also one of}} <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> of the Tour de Langkawi cycling race.|$|E
25|$|Spore is a {{game that}} is {{separated}} into stages, each stage presenting {{a different type of}} experience with different goals to achieve. <b>The</b> five <b>stages</b> are <b>the</b> Cell <b>Stage,</b> <b>the</b> Creature <b>Stage,</b> <b>the</b> Tribal <b>Stage,</b> <b>the</b> Civilization <b>Stage,</b> and <b>the</b> Space <b>Stage.</b> Once <b>the</b> primary objective is completed, the player has the option to advance to <b>the</b> next <b>stage,</b> or to continue playing <b>the</b> current <b>stage.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> {{itself was}} a diamond form, {{with a number of}} singing and playing {{positions}} that would allow band members to rotate around. Two drum kits were typically setup on opposite sides of <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> with <b>the</b> ability to lower the kits down below <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> or raise it to <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> itself, as well as move the kits around to different positions on <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> Some selected fans were located in a pit inside <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> area dubbed <b>the</b> [...] "Snakepit" [...] by the band.|$|R
5000|$|Amelogenesis is {{considered}} to have three <b>stages.</b> [...] <b>The</b> first <b>stage</b> is known as <b>the</b> inductive <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> second is <b>the</b> secretory <b>stage,</b> and <b>the</b> third <b>stage</b> is known as <b>the</b> maturation <b>stage.</b> During <b>the</b> inductive <b>stage,</b> ameloblast differentiation from IEE is initiated. Proteins and an organic matrix form a partially mineralized enamel in <b>the</b> secretory <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> maturation <b>stage</b> completes enamel mineralization.|$|R
5|$|Since 1983, large festivals have {{required}} licences from local authorities. This led to certain restrictions {{being placed on}} the festival, including a crowd limit and specified times during which <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> could operate. The crowd limit was initially set at 30,000 but has grown every year to over 100,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} shows <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> of courtship {{as described}} by Milton, as men are seduced by women and pass from enjoying the company of other men into married life. Etty worked through various configurations for {{the characters in the}} painting before settling on his final design.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the test {{is to ensure that}} the right to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action. <b>The</b> <b>stages</b> of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional.|$|E
50|$|Outdoors, the Diamond {{can provide}} seating for 3,500 with <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> behind home plate; 5,500 with <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> behind second base or 9,000 with <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> in center field.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> is over 5000 sq ft. Dressing {{rooms are}} under <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> A sound station with view of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> is at <b>the</b> {{back of the}} ground level seating.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> {{travelled}} through <b>the</b> {{departments of}} Meurthe-et-Moselle and Vosges. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> had {{most of the}} route as undulating, with a mild climb. Towards <b>the</b> end, <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> entered low mountains.|$|R
5|$|The rows in the {{following}} table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run. A year after the race, Alessandro Petacchi was stripped of all his results; this table reflects <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> and jersey awards he originally won.|$|E
5|$|The {{winner of}} the general {{classification}} received a grand prize of 5,325 lire. Every rider who finished the race with more than 100 points without winning any prizes in any of <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> was given 100 lire.|$|E
5|$|Adults of {{different}} species infest {{different parts of}} the definitive host, for example the intestine, lungs, large blood vessels, and liver. The adults use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids or blood. In both the adults and <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> that live in snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> rises about 3 ft {{above the}} floor, with 6 ft wide wings on either side. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> is 17 ft by 30 ft. A low wall {{separates}} the orchestra pit from the seating. Doors {{at the rear}} of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> lead to dressing rooms. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> edge is equipped with footlights, while <b>the</b> original painted <b>stage</b> backdrop remains operable.|$|R
50|$|If normal cubes or {{advantage}} cubes {{fall off}} the end of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> without being cleared, the number of fallen cubes will be calculated on the block scale (i.e. a counter is increased by 1). Every time the number of fallen cubes exceed that of the block scale, a row of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> is lost (thereby reducing the number of rows the cubes have to travel to fall off). This number is equal to the width of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> minus one. On <b>the</b> first <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> is 4 cubes wide, so the limit is 3; on <b>the</b> final <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> limit is 6 because <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> is 7 cubes wide. If a normal or advantage cube falls {{off the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> that set is not considered perfect (see below).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> is {{of timber}} boards. Over <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> is a {{proscenium}} decorated with timber mouldings. Above <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> is a timber catwalk, from {{which can be}} seen the substantial timber king-post roof trusses.|$|R
5|$|Because postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} is so rare, and occurs under highly idiosyncratic conditions {{regarding the}} individual and the ambient environment, this phenomenon has not been studied for possible applications to forensic investigation. Even if the study of postmortem fetal extrusion could lead to improved investigative methods, experimental research would be highly problematic. At present, forensic scientists have at their disposal an array of established techniques and procedures for a death investigation at <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> of decomposition when postmortem fetal extrusion typically occurs.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham Museums Trust runs other {{museums in}} the city {{including}} Aston Hall, Blakesley Hall, the Museum of the Jewellery Quarter, Soho House and Sarehole Mill. The Birmingham Back to Backs are the last surviving court of back-to-back houses {{in the city}}. Cadbury World is a museum showing visitors <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> and steps of chocolate production {{and the history of}} chocolate and the company. The Ikon Gallery hosts displays of contemporary art, as does Eastside Projects.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine {{education}} {{was the product}} of an ancient Greek educational tradition that stretched back to the 5th century BC. It comprised a tripartite system of education that, taking shape during the Hellenistic era, was maintained, with inevitable changes, up until the fall of Constantinople. <b>The</b> <b>stages</b> of education were the elementary school, where pupils ranged from six to ten years, secondary school, where pupils ranged from ten to sixteen, and higher education.|$|E
40|$|Endoscopic {{ultrasound}} (EUS) is {{an important}} tool in <b>the</b> <b>staging</b> of gastrointestinal cancers. This review highlights the use of EUS in <b>the</b> <b>staging</b> of gastrointestinal luminal malignancies and compares the performance of EUS with other imaging modalities (CT, MRI and PET-CT) in <b>the</b> <b>staging</b> of these malignancies. Management algorithms in <b>the</b> <b>staging</b> of these malignancies are also presented...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Stage</b> Band has won {{the first}} place provincially as the best middle school jazz band. In May 2008, <b>the</b> <b>Stage</b> Band went to New York City with the Jazz Choir {{as part of their}} tour. <b>The</b> <b>Stage</b> Band and Jazz Choir have also {{travelled}} to New Orleans in May 2010. In 2012, <b>the</b> <b>Stage</b> Band and Jazz Choir travelled to Chicago to perform. In 2014, the Jazz choir, <b>the</b> <b>Stage</b> Band, and <b>the</b> Chamber Strings went to New York City To perform.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> for Joey's North American {{tour was}} also a [...] "three sided" [...] <b>stage</b> but unlike <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> in Malaysia it also {{included}} a large screen which projected video backdrops and live footage, as well as six metal columns hung around the screen. While <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> win Toronto was larger {{than the one in}} Malaysia, this time there wasn't an elevator in the middle and Joey entered and left <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> using a flight of stairs at the back of <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|R
5|$|For the {{production}} of the show, Gaga enlisted choreographer Richard Jackson and together with him and the Haus of Gaga, they came up with ideas regarding how the show should be constructed and what music should be performed. They also {{had to find a way}} to co-mingle all the different ideas to make a single, coherent show. For the choreography, which encompassed all <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> present, Jackson had to employ a different approach, so that the audience could see the performance from every angle.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, torrential rain flooded {{some of the}} {{traditional}} village centre and primary school. The storm coincided with the annual Glade music festival and jeopardised the event. The festival gates were temporarily closed while organisers assessed the flooding, which submerged one of <b>the</b> <b>stages.</b> The festival's car park was incapacitated, with thousands of revellers stranded {{in the village and}} surrounding lanes.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg's stages are not {{culturally}} neutral, {{as demonstrated}} by its application {{to a number of}} different cultures. Although they progress through <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> in the same order, individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates. Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> event's twentieth <b>stage</b> saw Chioccioli and Chiappucci attack Indurain several times. Chioccioli won <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> and was <b>the</b> first {{over most}} of the {{categorized}} climbs on <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> but Indurain finished with the same time. <b>The</b> penultimate <b>stage</b> resulted in a field sprint that was won by Cipollini for his fourth victory of this edition. <b>The</b> final <b>stage</b> of <b>the</b> race was a [...] individual time trial. Race leader Indurain won <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> by two minutes and forty-six seconds over the second-place finisher on <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> thereby sealing his overall victory.|$|R
50|$|Psychodrama {{has three}} {{important}} techniques: {{the technique of}} doubling, the technique of mirroring, and the technique of role reversal. Each technique represents different stages in Moreno's theory {{of the development of}} <b>the</b> infant: <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> of identity (<b>the</b> <b>stage</b> of doubling), <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> of <b>the</b> recognition of <b>the</b> self (<b>the</b> <b>stage</b> of mirroring), and <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> of <b>the</b> recognition of <b>the</b> other (<b>the</b> <b>stage</b> of role reversal). Role reversal requires that one has learned to differentiate in the areas of time, place and person, and is capable of moving out of his own position into another's position to be able to enact that other role.|$|R
