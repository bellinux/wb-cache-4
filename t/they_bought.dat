5|$|His {{practice}} of dividing {{his time between}} Britain and America caused Wodehouse difficulties with the tax authorities of both countries. Both the UK Inland Revenue and the US Internal Revenue Service sought to tax him as a resident.

5|$|In 2004, Bethesda Softworks {{purchased}} the license {{to develop and}} publish Fallout 3, {{as well as an}} option to create two sequels, from Interplay Entertainment.

5|$|Some of {{the first}} {{settlers}} lived in caves dug {{out of the river}} bank, but the city grew with construction of homes, churches, and wharves. The new landowners did not share Penn's vision of a non-congested city. Most people bought land along the Delaware River instead of spreading westward towards the Schuylkill. The lots <b>they</b> <b>bought</b> were subdivided and resold with smaller streets constructed between them. Before 1704, few people lived west of Fourth Street.|$|E

5|$|After the Nazis {{seized power}} {{the family moved}} first to Möhlstrasse in Munich, and in 1934 to Lake Tegern, where <b>they</b> <b>bought</b> a house. Himmler also later {{obtained}} a large house in the Berlin suburb of Dahlem, free of charge, as an official residence. The couple saw little of each other as Himmler became totally absorbed by work. The relationship was strained. The couple did unite for social functions; they were frequent guests at the Heydrich home. Margarete saw it as her duty to invite the wives of the senior SS leaders over for afternoon coffee and tea on Wednesday afternoons.|$|E
5|$|By 1896 {{the family}} had hit another period of {{financial}} trouble, and Hastings left Charterhouse to move to continental Europe {{with his mother and}} older brother Archie until there was enough money for the family to return to London.

After six months in Ajaccio the family moved again, this time to the Ardennes, where they also learnt how to fish and ride horses.|$|E
5|$|Despite early success, the series, {{along with}} the overall rhythm game genre, {{suffered}} from poor sales starting in 2009. Company spokesman Eric Hollreiser said consumer research suggested continued solid demand for the series. Still, by early 2011, Activision stated that the series was on hiatus for 2011, while a seventh main title in the series was under development; this title was later cancelled due to the poor quality of the emerging product. Activision later shut down sales of the series' downloadable content, although users who purchased material from it previously may still play what <b>they</b> <b>bought.</b>|$|E

5|$|Dolan was {{dismissed}} in May 2003, the new board citing financial {{reasons for his}} departure. At 27 years, York player Chris Brass was appointed player-manager in June 2003, which made him the youngest Football League managerial appointment since 1946. The club's lease of Bootham Crescent was extended to May 2004, and plans proceeded to develop Huntington Stadium ahead of a possible move, but problems bringing the ground to Football League standards were encountered. The board preferred to stay at Bootham Crescent, and <b>they</b> <b>bought</b> the site in February 2004 {{after six months of}} negotiations. The deal came after York were lent £2million by The Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF), with which <b>they</b> <b>bought</b> 75.89% of BCH shares and all of the 20,000 shares owned by Persimmon. Once plans for a new stadium were settled, the loan would be converted a grant to help fund the move. York equalled a club record by winning the first four matches of 2003–04, and by mid January 2004 were 10th in the table. They won none of their final 20 fixtures, garnering only five more points as they finished bottom of the Third Division. York were relegated to the Conference National after 75 years of Football League membership. Beck renounced his title of chairman in September 2004 because he favoured a more democratic approach for a fan-owned club. The board was restructured and Jason McGill became the managing director.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} editing The Suffragette, Barrett {{struck up a}} {{friendship}} with the Australian author I. A. R. Wylie, who contributed to the paper in 1913. The two of them started a relationship and became lovers. In 1919 both Barrett and Wylie travelled to the United States, where <b>they</b> <b>bought</b> a car and spent over a year travelling the country. They stayed in New York and San Francisco and were recorded in the 1920 census as living in Carmel-By-The-Sea in California, where Wylie is classed {{as the head of}} the household and Barrett her friend.|$|E
5|$|Football resumed {{after the}} war for the 1919–20 season and Villa won their sixth FA Cup {{at the end of}} season, beating Huddersfield Town 1–0 at Stamford Bridge. In November 1923, Villa's centre-half Tommy Ball was killed by his neighbour, thus {{becoming}} the only active Football League player to have been murdered. In their Golden Jubilee season of 1923–24, Villa got through to the second final to be held at the then new Wembley Stadium, where they lost 2–0 to Newcastle United. This Cup final was to be something of a pinnacle though as Villa then had League finishes of sixth and tenth in the following seasons. The Directors attempted to stop the slump with transfer dealings. In 1927, <b>they</b> <b>bought</b> both Jimmy Gibson and Eric Houghton. In 1928, <b>they</b> <b>bought</b> {{in one of the most}} prolific goalscorers to have ever played in the English football league. When Villa signed Tranmere Rovers striker Tom Waring for £4,700, he was relatively unknown. Waring scored a record 49 league goals in the 1930–31 season as Villa finished runners-up to Arsenal. One of the other purchases, Eric Houghton, scored 30 goals.|$|E

5|$|Hines led John Hunt Morgan back to Confederate lines. First, {{they arrived}} at the train station in {{downtown}} Columbus, where <b>they</b> <b>bought</b> tickets to Cincinnati, Ohio. The duo jumped off the train before it entered the Cincinnati train station. They continued to evade capture in Cincinnati, staying for one night at the Ben Johnson House in Bardstown, Kentucky. In Tennessee, Hines diverted the Union troops' attention away from John Hunt Morgan, and was himself recaptured and sentenced to death by hanging. He escaped that night by telling stories to the soldier in charge of him and subdued him when given the chance. A few days later he again escaped Union soldiers who intended to hang him.|$|E
5|$|Jane Howard {{found that}} the house had {{previously}} been called Lemmons, and decided to restore that name. It was known as Gladsmuir when <b>they</b> <b>bought</b> it—from Gladsmuir Heath, the former name of Hadley Common, site of the Battle of Barnet in 1471 during the Wars of the Roses. The house had been registered under that name as a Grade II listed building in 1949, previously known as Gladsmuir House, with an address in Hadley Wood Road. As of 2014 the address was listed as Hadley Common.|$|E
5|$|Manningham Rugby Football Club, {{formed in}} 1876, {{originally}} played games at Cardigan Fields, in the Carlisle Road area of Bradford. When their ground {{was sold to}} facilitate the construction of Drummond School, the club required a new home. Consequently, <b>they</b> <b>bought</b> one-third of the Valley Parade site in Manningham, taking a short-term lease out {{on the rest of}} the land in time to play there for the 1886–87 season. The new ground and the road it was built upon both adopted the name of the local area, Valley Parade, a name deriving from the steep hillside below Manningham. The land was previously a quarry, and formed part of a greater site owned by Midland Railway Company.|$|E
