50|$|Many Parisian streets have {{retained}} their ancient denomination {{in spite of}} city growth; today {{it is still possible}} to discern pre-1701 delimitations in Paris by marking the point where a <b>thoroughfare's</b> <b>name</b> changes from rue to rue du faubourg. For instance, the rue du Faubourg Saint-Denis used to be located outside of the city wall and was an extension of the rue Saint-Denis within the walls. The rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré came about in a similar manner.|$|R
50|$|The {{section of}} Milligan Street north of Roe Street {{and the small}} side-street between Murray and Wellington Streets were {{originally}} part of a separate (although intersecting) <b>thoroughfare</b> <b>named</b> Melbourne Street (after William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne).

In 1838 Melbourne Street continued past James Street, but by 1845 Russell Square has been constructed and Melbourne Street terminated at James Street.|$|R

Albeit not a road, the Dora river is also a significant element for the whole district, since it completely crosses it from West to East.|$|R

The homes were expected to be a minimum of , with a total cost starting at $1.5 million.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{earliest}} Glen Burnie schools was First Avenue Elementary, built in 1899. The oldest area church is St. Alban's Episcopal, {{which was built}} in 1904, with many of its bricks dating back to Marley Chapel, an early Maryland parish from the 1730s. Crain Highway, one of Glen Burnie's main <b>thoroughfares</b> (<b>named</b> after State Senator Robert Crain), opened in 1927 and Ritchie Highway (Maryland Route 2, named for ex-Governor Albert C. Ritchie) followed in 1939. Ritchie Highway carried nearly all Baltimore-area traffic headed for Annapolis and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge until an alternate bypass road, Interstate 97, opened in the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>thoroughfare's</b> <b>name</b> sounds tautological or self-contradictory from a North American perspective, where avenue {{is one of}} {{the most}} common generic designations for street names; Robert Fulford once wrote that it [...] "sounded like an {{identity}} crisis with pavement". [...] However, Avenue Road is a common street name elsewhere in the English-speaking world, notably London, where at least 40 streets bear this name. In British English, an avenue is a row of trees, hence Avenue Road denotes a street lined with trees. Thus one's reaction to the name may be seen as a shibboleth evincing attachment to British or American culture.|$|R

50|$|To {{generate}} {{funds to}} reduce the Deerwood Country Club's financial burden, {{it was discovered that}} the club owned land that could be sold for development. In the summer of 2005, a local developer paid $2.6 million to purchase 140 acre on {{the north end of the}} country club—the last large undeveloped parcel, which was mostly wetlands once viewed as too expensive to utilize. The Collins Group plotted 26 1 acre homesites on a new <b>thoroughfare</b> <b>named</b> Collins Grove Road for multimillion-dollar homes while reserving 100 acre for conservation. The homes were expected to be a minimum of 5000 sq ft, with a total cost starting at $1.5 million.|$|R

However, due to intense opposition [...] - [...] much of it from environmental activists [...] - [...] the section of the parkway that would have passed over the land on which the establishment stood ended up never actually being built. Only the section of the parkway south and east of this point was constructed; overlaying a pre-existing <b>thoroughfare</b> <b>named</b> Drumgoole Boulevard (in honor of the Roman Catholic priest who founded an orphanage in Pleasant Plains), it opened in the autumn of 1972.|$|R
