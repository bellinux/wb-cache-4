5|$|After the {{declaration}} of war on Nazi Germany by Britain and France {{in the aftermath of}} the German invasion of Poland, nine months of stalemate took place along the Western Front. After the Polish Campaign, in October 1939, the planners of the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (Luftwaffe High Command) and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> attentions to Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{some women}} who had been {{especially}} active in supporting the war on the home front <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> organizational skills to other concerns, especially prohibition and woman suffrage. In 1874, for example, Zerelda Wallace, the wife of former Indiana governor David Wallace and stepmother of General Lew Wallace, became a founder of the Indiana chapter of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and served as its first president.|$|E
5|$|And matters {{continued}} {{thus for}} a considerable time. But a sedition and civil war came upon the wretched people and <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> cruelty toward us against one another. So we breathed {{for a little while}} as they ceased from their rage against us. But presently the change from that milder reign was announced to us, and great fear of what was threatened seized us.|$|E

5|$|In May 1943, the Axis {{powers of}} Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were {{defeated}} in the North African Campaign. Two months later, the Allied powers of Great Britain and the United States successfully launched their invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky.

5|$|Leaders of AASEREA {{continued}} {{a campaign}} to unionize public transportation companies in American cities. The Indianapolis Street Railway Company, a smaller transportation company, did unionize in 1899 when its employees {{became part of the}} Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees of America (AASEREA). After a series of successful AASEREA supported strikes, the latest in Cincinnati, Ohio during May 1913, the union leaders <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> attention back to Indianapolis.|$|E

5|$|Lowe {{suffered}} {{a knee injury}} late in the 1902 season, providing Evers with more playing time. Tinker, Evers, and Chance first appeared in a game together on September 13, 1902. They <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> first double play on September 15, 1902. Lowe's injury did not properly heal during the offseason, making Evers the new permanent second baseman for the Cubs in 1903. Chance succeeded Selee as manager during the 1905 season when Selee became ill.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Seljuq Zengi, Atabeg of Mosul, {{had added}} to his rule in 1128 Aleppo, the key to power in Syria, contested between the rulers of Mosul and Damascus. Both Zengi and King Baldwin II <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> {{attention}} towards Damascus; Baldwin was defeated outside the great city in 1129. Damascus, ruled by the Burid Dynasty, later allied with King Fulk when Zengi besieged the city in 1139 and 1140; the alliance was negotiated by the chronicler Usamah ibn Munqidh.|$|E
5|$|Replying to the Wrights' letters, the U.S. {{military}} expressed {{virtually no}} interest in their claims.

They also met with aviation representatives in Germany and Britain. Before traveling, Orville shipped a newly built Model A Flyer to France in anticipation of demonstration flights.|$|E

5|$|After the {{declaration}} of war on Nazi Germany by the United Kingdom and France, {{in the aftermath of}} the German invasion of Poland, nine months of stalemate took place along the Western Front named the Phoney War. The only military action was the French Army's Saar Offensive which was terminated in controversial circumstances. After the Polish Campaign, in October 1939, the planners of the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (Luftwaffe High Command) and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> attentions to Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Backing up {{the guns}} were the fighter {{aircraft}} of the North Vietnamese Air Force, which originally consisted of only 53 MiG-17 Fresco fighter aircraft. Though considered antiquated by the Americans {{when compared to}} their supersonic jets, the North Vietnamese <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> aircraft's weaknesses into strengths. They were fast enough for hit and run ambush operations and they were also maneuverable enough to shock the American fighter community by shooting down more advanced F-8 Crusaders and F-105 Thunderchiefs, which had to quickly develop new tactics. The newer missile-armed F-4 Phantom would become the Americans' primary dogfighting platform.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the second}} leg, Ridsdale took out {{advertisements}} in British newspapers calling for calm, with the messages in the adverts also being translated into Turkish. Despite this, West Yorkshire Police warned local Turkish businesses to close early.

During the first minute of the match, Leeds fans <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> backs on the match in protest of, what was viewed as, a lack of justice.|$|E

5|$|Emergency {{medicine}} {{has been a}} recognized medical specialty in the United States and other developed countries for nearly forty years, although these countries' EMSs did not become fully mature until the early 1990s. At that point, some of its practitioners <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> attention from developing the specialty at home to developing it abroad, leading {{to the birth of}} international emergency medicine. They began to support the growth of emergency medicine worldwide, doing so through conferences, national and regional emergency medicine organizations, relief and development organizations, international emergency medicine fellowships, physician exchanges, information transfer, and curriculum development.|$|E
5|$|France officially {{entered the}} war on 17 June 1778, and the French ships sent to the Western Hemisphere {{spent most of the}} year in the West Indies, and only sailed to the Thirteen Colonies from July until November. In the first Franco-American campaign, a French fleet {{commanded}} by Vice-Admiral Comte Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing attempted landings in New York and Newport, but due to a combination of poor co-ordination and bad weather, d'Estaing and Vice-Admiral Lord Richard Howe naval forces did not engage during 1778. After the French fleet departed, the British <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> attention to the south. In 1779, the French fleet returned to assist American forces attempting to recapture Savannah from British forces.|$|E
5|$|Long-time {{assistant}} coach Brian Schmetzer {{was promoted to}} interim head coach. The same day, the club announced their signing of Uruguayan midfielder Nicolás Lodeiro on a designated player contract, {{as well as the}} return of former designated player Álvaro Fernández. Despite the sluggish start as well as the loss of midfielder Clint Dempsey, who was forced in August to stop playing after evaluations for an irregular heartbeat, the Sounders <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> season around with 8 wins, 2 losses, and 4 draws. In the process, they came back from 9th to 4th in the Western Conference and qualified for the 2016 MLS Cup Playoffs. Schmetzer was named as permanent head coach as a result.|$|E

5|$|On 30 April 1945, II./JG 1 was {{combined}} with I./JG 1 at Leck to form two new groups (Gruppen): I. (Einsatz)/JG 1 and II. (Sammel)/JG 1; a combined {{total of about}} 50 pilots and aircraft. On 4 May 1945, all of JG 1's surviving He-162s were formed into a special consolidated Intervention groups (Einsatzgruppen). However, on 5 May 1945, the war ended with Germany's surrender. The terms of the surrender required that the Luftwaffe cease all operations.. Surviving JG 1 crews subsequently <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> He 162s over to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Regular Democrats {{were forced}} to call for {{annexation}} of Texas in their platform, {{but there was a}} bitter battle for the presidential nomination. Ballot after ballot, Van Buren failed to win the necessary super-majority of Democratic votes, and slowly fell in the rankings. It was not until the ninth ballot that the Democrats <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> sights to James K. Polk, a less prominent candidate who supported annexation. They found him to be perfectly suited for their platform, and he was nominated with two-thirds of the vote. Tyler considered his work vindicated, and implied in an acceptance letter that annexation was his true priority rather than election.|$|E
5|$|Renovation of Kenilworth Road was {{neglected}} for {{the next}} two decades—financial difficulties and the club's ambitions to build a new ground meant that regeneration was unaffordable, and would also prove unnecessary should relocation occur. However, following the rejection of several potential sites for a new ground, the club finally <b>turned</b> <b>their</b> attentions back to the maintenance of Kenilworth Road. The first real modernisation of the ground came in 1973, with the first addition of seats at the stadium since the construction of the new Main Stand in 1922. The Bobbers Stand became all-seated, {{while the rest of the}} ground remained terracing. The new-look stand could only hold 1,539 seats, and as a result the capacity of the ground dropped to 22,601.|$|E
