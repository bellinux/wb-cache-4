50|$|Member States set up {{national}} {{regulatory agencies}} (NRA's) that oversaw these directives and developed {{policies and procedures}} for <b>telecommunications</b> <b>organizations</b> to follow. The directives provided a framework for the EU commission to ensure compliance and take judicial action when necessary.

50|$|Prior to 1987, the European {{telecommunications}} market consisted predominantly of monopolies or <b>telecommunications</b> <b>organizations</b> (TO's) such as BT, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. In 1987, the European Union {{adopted the}} 1987 Green Paper that essentially stated {{it was in}} Europe's best interests to overhaul the current system and liberalize telecommunications services. As a result, from 1988 to 1998 the European Commission adopted multiple directives that obligated member states to open markets for equipment, telecom services, value-added, data services, satellite, mobile and voice to competition.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{submarine}} cables {{were simple}} point-to-point connections. With {{the development of}} submarine branching units (SBUs), more than one destination could be served by a single cable system. Modern cable systems now usually have their fibers arranged in a self-healing ring to increase their redundancy, with the submarine sections following different paths on the ocean floor. One driver for this development was that the capacity of cable systems had become so large {{that it was not}} possible to completely back-up a cable system with satellite capacity, so it became necessary to provide sufficient terrestrial back-up capability. Not all <b>telecommunications</b> <b>organizations</b> wish to take advantage of this capability, so modern cable systems may have dual landing points in some countries (where back-up capability is required) and only single landing points in other countries where back-up capability is either not required, the capacity to the country is small enough to be backed up by other means, or having back-up is regarded as too expensive.|$|E

5000|$|In 1966, the Government of The Bahamas, by an Act of Parliament, {{incorporated}} the Telecommunications Department as the Bahamas Telecommunications Corporation, a quasi-governmental corporation, known as Batelco. In 1967, the formerly expatriate-run Batelco got its first all-Bahamian Executive team, {{under the direction}} of R.E. Knowles, the first Bahamian General Manager. In 1971, direct distance dialing was introduced for Batelco operators and in 1972, under new General Manager Albury E. Curling, a $7 million submarine cable was installed from West Palm Beach to Eight Mile Rock through a joint venture agreement between AT & T and Batelco. Robert Bartlett took the reins of the Corporation on October 15, 1979, when he became General Manager. Under Mr. Bartlett’s administration, Batelco moved from its rented location in the Chase Building on Thompson Boulevard to its own offices on John F. Kennedy Drive, where the company’s headquarters is currently located. [...] In 1986 the Corporation joined the Caribbean Association of National <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Organizations</b> (CANTO) and hosted its annual meeting and trade show, as well as acquiring the assets of The Grand Bahama Telephone Company. It was also in the late eighties that Cellular Telephone Service was inaugurated in The Bahamas. In 1990, Robert Bartlett retired and Barrett Russell succeeded him as General Manager. In February 1992, fibre optics became a part of the Batelco system, enabling system upgrades throughout the archipelago, including Inagua where service was introduced in March of that year. Sir Albert Miller took over as Executive Chairman of Batelco in 1995. The following year, on April 10, 1996, an agreement was signed for the engineering and installation of the Bahamas II Submarine Cable and, on August 26, Batelco entered the internet market with the introduction of Batelnet. The 1990s ended with the introduction of CLASS to residential customers, bringing them caller id, automatic recall {{and a number of other}} features. The end of the millennium also saw significant upgrades to its fiber optic system, including a 26 million dollar cable between Vero Beach, Florida and Eight Mile Rock owned by a consortium with Batelco and AT&T as the Terminal parties.|$|E

40|$|International {{telecommunications}} facilities [...] both satellite and cable circuits [...] in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean basins {{are characterized by}} persistent excess capacity. Although some excess is desirable to provide flexibility and protection against system failure, the problem {{is so great that}} Intelsat has 100 satellite transponders deemed surplus to international requirements. However, plans are under way for continued expansion of cable and satellite capacity. This article examines why <b>telecommunications</b> <b>organizations</b> are investing in such a seemingly wasteful manner. Three possible explanations are explored: (a) over-optimistic traffic forecasts, (b) market structure and regulatory policy, and (c) inefficient pricing of circuits. ...|$|E

Given its intrinsic advantages, especially in Europe, a separate satellite network could lead to efficiency gains resulting from facility-based competition. Moreover, a satellite entrant may induce the terrestrial network operators to compete directly against each other. It may therefore offer {{a solution to the problem}} of network fragmentation in Europe. Moreover, its insensitivity to distance implies that a satellite competitor will foster universal service. It is therefore argued that Eutelsat, the main player in the European satellite market, should be separated from the national <b>telecommunications</b> <b>organizations...</b>|$|E
