5|$|The {{assembly}} of <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> (i.e., {{the citizens of}} Rome), the Comitia Tributa, was presided over by a consul, and was composed of 35 tribes. <b>The</b> <b>tribes</b> were not ethnic or kinship groups, but rather geographical subdivisions. The order that the thirty-five tribes would vote in was selected randomly by lot. Once a measure received support from a majority of <b>the</b> <b>tribes,</b> the voting would end. While it did not pass many laws, the Comitia Tributa did elect quaestors, curule aediles, and military tribunes. The Plebeian Council was identical to the {{assembly of}} <b>the</b> <b>tribes,</b> but excluded the patricians (the elite who could trace their ancestry to the founding of Rome). They elected their own officers, plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles. Usually a plebeian tribune would preside over the assembly. This assembly passed most laws, and could also act as a court of appeal.|$|E

5|$|According to legend, the Roman King Servius Tullius {{enacted a}} series of {{constitutional}} reforms in the 6th century BC. One of these reforms resulted {{in the creation of}} a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens. This unit, the Tribe, was based on geography rather than family, and was created to assist in future reorganizations of the army. In 471 BC, a law was passed which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they had organized on the basis of the Curia. The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary Tribal Assembly (which also organized on the basis of <b>the</b> <b>Tribes)</b> was that <b>the</b> <b>Tribes</b> of the Plebeian Council only included Plebeians, whereas <b>the</b> <b>Tribes</b> of the Tribal Assembly included both Plebeians and Patricians.|$|E

Since Duro held that <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> had lost their inherent sovereignty, {{the only way for}} <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> to regain jurisdiction over non-member Indians would be by the delegation of that jurisdiction by Congress. Bourland was even more specific as to that point.

5|$|Although the Offaly revolt was {{followed}} by a determination to rule Ireland more closely, Henry was wary of drawn-out conflict with <b>the</b> <b>tribes,</b> and a royal commission recommended that the only relationship with <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> was to be promises of peace, their land protected from English expansion. The man to lead this effort was Sir Antony St Leger, as Lord Deputy of Ireland, who would remain into the post past Henry's death. Until the break with Rome, it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere fiefdom to the English king, so in 1541 Henry asserted England's claim to the Kingdom of Ireland free from the Papal overlordship. This change did, however, also allow a policy of peaceful reconciliation and expansion: the Lords of Ireland would grant their lands to the King, before being returned as fiefdoms. The incentive to comply with Henry's request was an accompanying barony, and thus a right to sit in the Irish House of Lords, which was to run in parallel with England's. The Irish law of <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> did not suit such an arrangement, because the chieftain did not have the required rights; this made progress tortuous, and the plan was abandoned in 1543, not to be replaced.|$|E

5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} around the Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet) that became known as Tecumseh's War.

He encouraged resistance by telling <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> to only pay white traders half of what they owed, and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, whiskey, and guns. In 1810, Tecumseh, with about 400 armed warriors, traveled to Vincennes where he confronted Harrison and demanded that the Treaty of Fort Wayne be rescinded. Although Harrison refused, the war party left peacefully, but Tecumseh was angry and threatened retaliation. After the meeting Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> in the region, hoping to create a confederation with which to battle the Americans.|$|E
