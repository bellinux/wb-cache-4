40|$|The Fast Illinois Solver Code (FISC) {{requirements}} about {{memory and}} {{central processing unit}} (CPU) time are discussed. FISC is designed to compute the RCS of a target described by a <b>triangular</b> facet <b>file.</b> Both complexities for the CPU time per iteration and memory requirements are of O(N log N), where N {{is the number of}} unknowns. The N scales approximately as the surface area of the scatterer, or N≈ 350 S (0. 1 λ/a) 2. The memory requirement is approximately 0. 75 S[0. 2 + 0. 8 (0. 1 λ/a) 2] MB. If one CPU of SGI CRAY Origin 2000 is used, for each frequency, FISC needs the set-up time Tfill≈ 5 sec., and solution time Tsolve = 0. 1 Slog(S) (S 1 / 4 +IopenS 1 / 2) sec for each angle. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|FISC (Fast Illinois Solver Code) is {{designed}} to compute RCS of a target described by a <b>triangular</b> facet <b>file.</b> The problem is formulated by the method of moments (MoM), where the RWG (Rao, Wilton, and Glisson) basis functions are used. The resultant matrix equation is solved iteratively by the conjugate gradient (CG) method. The multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) is used {{to speed up the}} matrix-vector multiply in CG. Both complexities for the CPU time per iteration and memory requirements are of O(NlogN), where N is the number of unknowns. 1. Introduction The fast multipole method is an efficient way to perform matrix-vector multiplies whereby the field at each particle due to every other particle is calculated for all particles in an ensemble of N particles. Ordinarily, this would require O(N 2) calculations. With the fast multipole method, this can be reduced to O(N) or O(N log N) depending on the spatial distribution density of the particles and implementation. The fast [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} phase {{diagram of the}} triangular-lattice Q-state Potts model in the real (Q,v) -plane, where v=e^J- 1 is the {{temperature}} variable. Our first goal is to provide an obviously missing feature of this diagram: {{the position of the}} antiferromagnetic critical curve. This curve turns out to possess a bifurcation point with two branches emerging from it, entailing important consequences for the global phase diagram. We have obtained accurate numerical estimates for the position of this curve by combining the transfer-matrix approach for strip graphs with toroidal boundary conditions and the recent method of critical polynomials. The second goal of this work is to study the corresponding A_p- 1 RSOS model on the torus, for integer p= 4, 5, [...] ., 8. We clarify its relation to the corresponding Potts model, in particular concerning the role of boundary conditions. For certain values of p, we identify several new critical points and regimes for the RSOS model and we initiate the study of the flows between the corresponding field theories.

30|$|In {{order to}} control size of nanoparticle, {{the effect of}} {{different}} temperatures was scrutinized on AuNP synthesis. TEM analysis revealed {{the change in the}} size and shape of the synthesized AuNPs at different temperatures (Additional file 1 : Figure S 6 (a-d)). It is evident from TEM images that the nanoparticles synthesized at 10 °C were flocculated and aggregated, the size exceeding a micrometer (Additional file 1 : Figure S 7). As the reaction temperature reached 20 °C, the shape of nanoparticles became mainly anisotropic in nature (Additional file 1 : Figure S 6 b). AuNPs synthesized at higher temperatures were polydisperse (Additional file 1 : Figure S 6 (c-d). The nanoparticle reduction was rapid at 100 °C and the process was complete with few minutes of reaction. The majority of AuNPs synthesized at this temperature were in the size range of 20 to 40 nm, and the particles synthesized were mainly spherical or elliptical in shape along with some tiny <b>triangular</b> nanoparticles (Additional <b>file</b> 1 : Figure S 6 d). This pattern of nanoparticle growth at low temperature, obtained in this study, is reasonable, since nucleation and growth is a kinetically driven process. Hence, the rate of reaction slows down at a low temperature which allows nucleation and crystal growth at a slow rate. Whereas, at high temperature, due to a rapid rate of reaction, the primary nucleation is immediately followed by a secondary reduction on the primary nuclei; hence, particle growth is stalled. Furthermore, the high rate of reaction also leads to the fast consumption of available ions, reducing them to zero valent form[22, 28].|$|R
