40|$|In this {{retrospective}} study, we {{aimed to}} describe {{the distribution of the}} number and its percentages of ankle foot deformities caused by Cerebral Palsy (CP) in disabled children who have attend in several special education and rehabilitation centers in Turkey so as to improve their quality of life. A total of 436 children with CP (205 female and 231 male) were aged between 10 and 468 months (mean�SD: 91. 94 � 63. 61), who have been treated in selected special education and rehabilitation centers for this study, were analyzed about ankle-foot deformities. During analyzing medical files belong to all subjects were detected to obtain the data. Deformity percentage in both sides (bilateral) demonstrated a grater value relative to the matched the only side, including right or left side. It �was �also found that equinovarus deformity in ankle-foot showed a high percentage (n= 146, 33. 5 %) much more than the other type of deformities in both female (31. 3 %) and male (35. 5 %) cerebral palsied children. In addition, the pes planus deformity was detected as the second high valued deformity (26. 1 %) among all subjects. On the other hand, <b>talipes</b> <b>calcaneus</b> deformity had the lowest percentage in the study. As expected, the high frequency of the deformities was found in the spastic cerebral palsied children (n= 243). Otherwise the low frequency about deformities was detected in the diskinetic cerebral palsied children (n= 5). In the present study, both equinovarus and pes planus deformities of the ankle-foot in cerebral palsied children were found as high percentage deformities in both genders. Moreover, spastic type CP leads to ankle-foot deformities much more than other types of CP...|$|E
