The best <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> is in late summer or spring. Plant in full sun or dappled shade, and in somewhat sandy soil. The addition of manure and a balanced fertilizer aids strong growth. Alternatively they can be planted in pots or special planters using compost. Fibre mats placed under each plant will protect fruits from touching the ground, and will act as a weed barrier.|$|E
2500|$|... (1993) was {{released}} {{as the second}} part of Ultima VII because it used the same game engine as Ultima VII. According to interviews, Richard Garriott felt it therefore did not warrant a new number. Production was rushed due to deadlines set to the developers, and the storyline was cut short; remains of the original, longer storyline {{can be found in the}} database. Following the Fellowship's defeat, its founder Batlin flees to the Serpent Isle, pursued by the Avatar and companions. Serpent Isle is revealed as another fragment of former Sosaria, and its history which is revealed throughout the game provides many explanations and ties up many loose ends left over from the Age of Darkness era. Magical storms herald the unraveling of the dying world's very fabric, and the game's mood is notably melancholic, including the voluntary sacrificial death of a long-standing companion of the Avatar. By the end of the game, the Avatar is abducted by the Guardian and thrown into another world, which becomes the setting for the next game in the series. [...] was an expansion pack for Ultima VII Part 2 where the Avatar travels back in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> a silver seed, thus balancing the forces that hold the Serpent Isle together. Like Forge of Virtue, the expansion contained an isolated sub-quest that was irrelevant to the main game's storyline, but provided the Avatar with a plethora of useful and powerful artifacts.|$|E

25|$|Interest in {{astronomy}} was evident {{as early as}} 1638 with the initiation of the first American printing press at Harvard College. In 1639 it printed the only American periodical during the seventeenth century, An Almanack Calculated for New England. During the seventeenth century, astronomical almanacs {{began to appear in}} the American colonies, especially New England. These almanacs contained phases of the moon, tide tables, best <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>plant,</b> and the setting of religious holidays. They also contained pieces on the celestial sphere.|$|R

5000|$|Thomas {{made some}} {{noteworthy}} contributions as an entomologist, having helped control the insect plague that was retarding {{the growth of}} the border states. Thomas, working with Charles V. Riley, found that the Hessian fly, which was terrorizing the wheat and rye of the western states, was most destructive in wet seasons and least destructive in dry seasons. [...] With this information they were able to predict the outbreaks rather accurately for the upcoming year, and entomologists and farmers worked together for better <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> and harvest.|$|R

50|$|Organic gardeners often plant {{hairy vetch}} (a nitrogen-fixing legume) as a {{companion}} plant to tomatoes, {{as an alternative}} to rotating crops in small growing areas. When it is <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> tomatoes in the spring, the hairy vetch is cut to the ground and the tomato seedlings are planted in holes dug through the matted residue and stubble. The vetch vegetation provides both nitrogen and an instant mulch that preserves moisture and keeps weeds from sprouting.|$|E
50|$|Deep Thunder {{could be}} used <b>to</b> {{determine}} optimal <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>plant,</b> irrigate, and harvest crops, based on the dynamic environmental conditions of individual farm locations. Precision agriculture using Deep Thunder could lead to better price points for crops by saving water, by allocating labor more effectively, and by improving supply chain efficiency. Using these methods of predictive weather farming, crop losses from weather can be cut by over 25%. The island nation of Brunei is working with Deep Thunder to develop precision weather forecast models to increase rice production.|$|R

50|$|E. verticillata {{comes in}} three forms: the Kirstenbosch form, the Pretoria {{form and the}} Kew form. It prefers {{seasonally}} moist sandy soils, but will grow well in average garden conditions provided the soils are acidic. The best <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> is in autumn or during the winter although they may be planted at other {{times of the year}} if regularly watered. It is important to never disturb its roots when weeding. Plants should be well watered after planting and then every two to three days unless good rainfalls occur.|$|E

5000|$|The {{classical}} silvicultural literature unanimously advocates spring as the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> bareroot stock, with {{lifting and}} outplanting taking place while {{the trees are}} still apparently dormant. This view, in which spring planting is implicit, was epitomized by Toumey and Korstian (1942): [...] "Almost without exception the most favourable time for ... planting is 2 weeks or more before buds the planting stock begin their growth". Soil moisture conditions are generally favourable {{at the time when}} the growing season is about to begin, while dormant stock is less subject to mechanical injury and physiological shock.|$|E
40|$|Is low input use by poor, {{smallholder}} farmers {{caused by}} time-inconsistent behavior or by limited ability to buy inputs? Are input subsidies {{the best solution}} to stimulate input demand or are there smarter solutions? These issues are investigated by combining survey data, stated preference ques-tions, and randomized experiments in Malawi. The demand for fertilizer at harvest time and at planting time, farm gate shadow prices for fertilizer, and {{the gap between the}} willingness-to-accept (WTA) and willingness-to-pay (WTP) prices for a standard input package were investigated. Significant effects of timing and of cash constraints were found, suggesting the possibility that smarter designs exist, such as distribution of smaller packages from harvest <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>planting</b> <b>time...</b>|$|R
50|$|Alexander Garden FRSE FRS (January 1730 - 15 April 1791) was a Scottish physician, {{botanist}} and zoologist. The gardenia flower {{is named}} after him.

50|$|Concerned {{about the}} issues of the move, many bands of Ojibwe {{gathered}} to deliberate their options. The discussions were so lengthy that the Ojibwe had little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> their regular spring crops. As a result, they had to go to Sandy Lake to gain payments and supplies for their survival. In the fall of 1850, representatives from 19 Ojibwe bands packed up and started the arduous journey to the shores of Sandy Lake, where they had been told to gather by late October. Nearly 3,000 Ojibwe men waited there for several weeks before a government agent arrived.|$|E
50|$|Agricultural {{productivity}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important as the world population continues to grow. India, one of the world's most populous countries, has taken steps in the past decades to increase its land productivity. Forty years ago, North India produced only wheat, but {{with the advent of}} the earlier maturing high-yielding wheats and rices, the wheat could be harvested in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> rice. This wheat/rice combination is now widely used throughout the Punjab, Haryana, and parts of Uttar Pradesh. The wheat yield of three tons and rice yield of two tons combine for five tons of grain per hectare, helping to feed India's 1.1 billion people.|$|E
50|$|The {{bulbs and}} bulblets of the twincrest onion may be planted as well. Maturity and {{flowering}} may come quicker planting by bulbs than planting by seeds. To do so, bulbs must be picked from the mature wild onion plant. These bulbs must then {{be stored in}} a dry environment (paper bags with dry peat moss is ideal). Late fall, when the first frost comes, is the best <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> these bulbs. These bulbs should be planted in an acidic potting soil with sand and humus for good drainage. Daughter bulblets may be planted next to mature bulbs to keep the dense pattern. Maintenance must be {{in order to make}} sure these bulbs do not receive too much water. These bulbs will germinate on their own in the spring time. When germination begins in the spring, water must be administered at least once a week. If it is a dry and rainless week, water should be administered twice that week. Adding a liquid fertilizer may increase growth and vigor. When flowering occurs, watering may be ceased.|$|E
5|$|Ephemerides {{with complex}} astrological calculations, and almanacs {{interpreting}} celestial events {{for use in}} medicine and for choosing <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> crops, were popular in Elizabethan England. In 1597, the English mathematician and physician Thomas Hood made a set of paper instruments that used revolving overlays to help students work out relationships between fixed stars or constellations, the midheaven, and the twelve astrological houses. Hood's instruments also illustrated, for pedagogical purposes, the supposed relationships between {{the signs of the}} zodiac, the planets, and the parts of the human body adherents believed were governed by the planets and signs. While Hood's presentation was innovative, his astrological information was largely standard and was taken from Gerard Mercator's astrological disc made in 1551, or a source used by Mercator.|$|R
