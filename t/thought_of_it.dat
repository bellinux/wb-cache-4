5|$|Long epic poetry was not {{a popular}} genre in North Korea before Mt. Paektu, {{but it was in}} the Soviet Union where Cho had immigrated from. Poema and Mayakovsky's prosody and poetry were also among Cho's {{influences}} that can be seen in Mt. Paektu. These Russian stylistic influences gave Mt. Paektu its peculiar characteristics that prompted mixed reactions from the North Korean public. For instance, some in the literature circles were unfamiliar with the concept of a lyrical epic and <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as an improbable amalgam of genres, criticizing the work for being indistinguishable from ordinary prose. According to North Korean studies scholar Alzo David-West, the relatively favorable reaction to Mt. Paektu compared to some other literature testifies to North Korean readership being capable at being both a receptive and a dismissive audience.|$|E
25|$|Although a socialist, Attlee still {{believed}} in the British Empire of his youth. He <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as an institution that was a power for good in the world. Nevertheless, he saw that {{a large part of}} it needed to be self-governing. Using the Dominions of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand as a model, he continued the transformation of the Empire into the modern-day British Commonwealth.|$|E
25|$|When she {{returned}} to Los Angeles, {{with her husband and}} business manager, Zack Harris, to visit her family and friends, they decided to stage the play Trial Marriage at the Egan Theatre, 1320 South Figueroa Street, with Glaum in the starring role. When asked by a reporter for the Times whether she would be doing any picture work, she said she had not <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but acknowledged that she was interested in talking pictures.|$|E

I <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> paying my {{debt to the}} Bellegardes that way. So I told them, and I frightened them. They have been staying in the country as you tell me, {{to keep out of}} the explosion. But I have given it up." ...|$|R
25|$|She {{was very}} {{beautiful}} girl, all my girls are beautiful. I went to London {{with her in}} 1933. Bucky (Buckminster Fuller) and I were there the night before she did it. I remember very well she said, 'Well that's {{the end of the}} vodka. There isn't any more.' Just like that you know. I wouldn't have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> much, except afterward I realized that that's what she was talking about. Dorothy was very pretty, and she traveled in this false world. She didn't want to be second to anybody, and she must have thought she was slipping.|$|E
25|$|On 26 March he {{accompanied}} LaRouche {{members to}} Frankfurt {{to hand out}} LaRouche literature in the streets, then to see the Rembrandt collection at the Städel museum. When one member asked what he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> he started crying. The woman invited him to step outside for some air. He kept repeating {{that he did not}} trust LaRouche, and said he {{wanted to go back to}} England. She told him he was free to leave and could phone her if he wanted to, which seemed to reassure him. She last saw him with one of his roommates sitting on the steps of the museum around 8:30pm.|$|E
25|$|Exhausted and {{frustrated}} by the antagonism in Palermo, Falcone accepted a post in the Ministry of Justice in Rome offered to him by Claudio Martelli, the new minister of Justice in a new government of Giulio Andreotti in March 1991. The transfer was initially seen as a capitulation by Falcone, but he himself <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as a tactical move to better fight the Mafia. His first action was to prepare a decree to repair the disastrous sentence by Supreme Court judge Corrado Carnevale, known as the “sentence-killer”, that allowed {{most of the remaining}} defendants of the Maxi Trial to walk free from prison. The Martelli decree led to the immediate re-arrest of the Mafia bosses.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{dismissed}} by critics as bubblegum at the time, a view initially held by band leader Ken Andrews: [...] "We were as {{disgusted with the}} <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> recording <b>it</b> as most people were at the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> buying <b>it.</b> But {{at the end of}} the day, we liked it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Iggy Pop praised {{their version}} and stated: [...] "That's good. She sings it well and she threw a little note in when she sings it, that I wish I had <b>thought</b> <b>of,</b> <b>it's</b> kind <b>of</b> {{improved}} <b>it</b> .... The horn thing is good." ...|$|R
50|$|There is some {{speculation}} as to {{what the}} song's lyrics are actually about. While there are <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> being about a battle with addiction, former bassist Jason Newsted believes it is about a person being put through mental torture.|$|R
25|$|On {{the night}} of the crash, Saint-Donat villagers {{remember}} hearing the noise of a large aircraft passing overhead and moments later an impact. Jos Gaudet, then on duty in fire tower number four at Archambault lake did see the light emitted by the burning wreckage on top of the mountain but <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as the reflection of the sun on a moist rocky slope. On the morning of the crash Gaudet and Georges Moore took a boat around lake Archambault to look for signs of wreckage such as oil slicks or debris, believing that the aircraft had fallen in the water. Later on, Mr. Moore went to the town hall to alert the military authorities but his claim was dismissed as being implausible.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} {{was generally not}} well known or understood during the war. The English people <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as a minor operation, a waste of precious resources which would be better spent on the Western Front, while the peoples of India {{were more interested in}} the Mesopotamian campaign and the occupation of Baghdad. Australia did not have a war correspondent in the area until Captain Frank Hurley, the first Australian Official Photographer, arrived in August 1917 after visiting the Western Front. Henry Gullett, the first Official War Correspondent, arrived in November 1917. The long-lasting effect of this {{campaign was}} the Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, when France won the mandate for Syria and Lebanon, while the British Empire won the mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine. The Republic of Turkey came into existence in 1923 after the Turkish War of Independence ended the Ottoman Empire. The European mandates ended with the formation of the Kingdom of Iraq in 1932, the Lebanese Republic in 1943, the State of Israel in 1948, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan and Syrian Arab Republic in 1946.|$|E

60|$|She went on {{and told}} him everything. She did not spare herself any fact that she thought he ought to know, and as she {{detailed}} the squalid history, {{it seemed to her}} far worse than it had ever been in her own <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R

500|$|Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein greatly {{enjoyed the}} episode and <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> {{as a great}} final episode that they ran. On the DVD audio commentary, writer Ned Goldreyer stated, [...] "I think {{this might have been}} the best episode ever produced." ...|$|E
500|$|Also, little remex. The most distal [...] The remicle is {{very small}} and usually non-functional—interpreted by Christian Ludwig Nitzsch as [...] "an aborted first primary". It was named by Richard S. Wray in 1887, who {{similarly}} <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as [...] "representing an originally functional primary".|$|E
500|$|Over $11million {{has been}} spent on the {{rehabilitation}} of Taliesin since 1998. Unfortunately, its preservation is [...] "fraught with epic difficulties", because Wright never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> {{as a series of}} buildings with a long-term future. It was built by inexperienced students, without solid foundations. Financing renovations has been challenging because revenue from Taliesin visitation has been lower than projected.|$|E
60|$|He handed Father a bundle. Father <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{throwing}} <b>it</b> at him, but simultaneously he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> keeping <b>it</b> and consuming its contents.

But before he could think of a smart, crushing, New-Yorkish reply the farmer grumped away into the house.|$|R

60|$|Besides, by his {{standing}} afar off, {{it might be}} to intimate that he now had in mind, and with great weight upon his conscience, the infinite distance that was betwixt God and him. Men should know that, and tremble in the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> when {{they are about to}} approach the omnipotent presence.|$|R
500|$|The word cê is a {{shortened}} {{version of}} the Portuguese personal pronoun você, meaning you. Veloso says that cê is a more [...] "colloquial" [...] version of você, used often in everyday speech. When he writes lyrics, Veloso typically writes the word você, but sings cê when performing. The inspiration for the album's title came when he wrote cê instead of você and <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as an appropriate title.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} a {{financial}} success for Comedy Central and helped the network transform into [...] "a cable industry power almost overnight". Despite this, critics gave the season mixed reviews. Parents Television Council rated it so offensive that it [...] "shouldn't have been made": [...] "it doesn't just push the envelope; it knocks it off the table", while another critic <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as [...] "coming pretty damn close" [...] to being a [...] "perfect" [...] television series season.|$|E
500|$|The {{work was}} {{expensive}} and by November 1923, the Association decided {{to advocate for}} a commemorative coin which it could buy from the government at face value and sell at a premium as a fundraiser. Two men each sought credit for {{coming up with the}} idea for a coin. [...] Daniel W. Webb, executive secretary of the Association, said he had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> after finding an Alabama centennial half dollar at home; journalist Harry Stillwell Edwards made a similar claim and apparently collected a reward from the Association.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{have found}} The Time Traveler's Wife {{difficult}} to classify generically: some categorize it as science fiction, others as a romance. Niffenegger herself {{is reluctant to}} label the novel, saying she [...] "never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as science fiction, {{even though it has}} a science-fiction premise". In Niffenegger's view, the story is primarily about Henry and Clare's relationship and the struggles they endure. She has said that she based Clare and Henry's romance on the [...] "cerebral coupling" [...] of Dorothy Sayers's characters Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane.|$|E
500|$|The Irish {{thought of}} Scotland as a provincial place. Others <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as an outlandish or barbaric place. [...] "Who would {{deny that the}} Scots are barbarians?" [...] was a rhetorical {{question}} posed {{by the author of}} the De expugnatione Lyxbonensi (i.e. [...] "On the Conquest of Lisbon"). A century later Louis IX of France was reported to have said to his son [...] "I would prefer that a Scot should come from Scotland and govern the people well and faithfully, than that you, my son, should be seen to govern badly." ...|$|E
500|$|Different {{from the}} other Hasbro {{properties}} Ball had worked on, she explained that Hasbro wanted the comic to entertain readers rather than be morally didactic. She likened this {{to the principle of}} [...] "no hugging, no learning" [...] coined on the set of Seinfeld. Apart from that, the studio gave Ball license to give Blythe hobbies not depicted on the show. Ball focused on writing stories that would appeal to readers transitioning from primary to secondary education. She described the structure for the comic as a daily drama, while Anderson <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as slice of life.|$|E
60|$|On these accounts, {{and some}} others, {{too long to}} mention here, I think <b>it</b> is out <b>of</b> doubt, that the {{easiness}} of the proceedings on commissions of bankrupt can be no encouragement to any tradesman to break, or so much as to entertain the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> with less horror and aversion {{than he would have}} done before this law was made.|$|R
