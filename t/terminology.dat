As the {{electronic}} health record evolves {{and the need for}} interoperability extends beyond local and national borders, a degree of standardisation across healthcare <b>terminologies</b> become essential. Harmonising across <b>terminologies</b> results in a) increased consensus relating to domain content and b) improvements in the <b>terminologies</b> involved.

40|$|AbstractA 1998 {{paper that}} {{delineated}} desirable characteristics, or desiderata for controlled medical <b>terminologies</b> attempted to summarize emerging consensus regarding structural issues of such <b>terminologies.</b> Among the Desiderata {{was a call}} for <b>terminologies</b> to be “concept oriented. ” Since then, research has trended toward the extension of <b>terminologies</b> into ontologies. A paper by Smith, entitled “From Concepts to Clinical Reality: An Essay on the Benchmarking of Biomedical Terminologies” urges a realist approach that seeks <b>terminologies</b> composed of universals, rather than concepts. The current paper addresses issues raised by Smith and attempts to extend the Desiderata, not away from concepts, but towards recognition that concepts and universals must both be embraced and can coexist peaceably in controlled <b>terminologies.</b> To that end, additional Desiderata are defined that deal with the purpose, rather than the structure, of controlled medical <b>terminologies...</b>|$|R

English <b>terminologies</b> are a set of words that related to a study or a subject while accounting department isa department that handles financial recording and reporting of a hotel, hotel is a business that provides its guests rooms for commercial purpose. In this research, the writer gathered the data with documentation research instrument, where he collected documents from Harris Hotel & Conventions Ciumbuleuit like purchase order, purchase requisition, bin card and chart of accounts, he researched and analyzed the data with qualitative method.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mathematics}} {{performance of}} students enrolling in the engineering technology subjects such as robotics, image processing, control systems {{and others have been}} degraded at an alarming rate during the recent years.

The inconsistency of <b>terminologies</b> used in mathematics and technical subjects has been identified as one of the main sources that contribute to this problem. In this paper, the mapping of the <b>terminologies</b> used in mathematics and image processing was done. It is found that there are different <b>terminologies</b> used in both subjects carry the same meaning and also some same <b>terminologies</b> used in both subjects represent different meanings. Thus it is recommended that lecturers teaching both subjects to introduce the variety of <b>terminologies</b> in defining a newly taught concept for teaching and learning of mathematics and image processing subjects...|$|R

As a first step to harmonize the nursing <b>terminologies,</b> {{the purpose of this}} study was to examine how nursing problems or diagnostic concepts from select <b>terminologies</b> were cross-mapped in Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). A comparison analysis was conducted by examining whether cross-mappings available in UMLS through concept unique identifiers were consistent with cross-mappings conducted by human experts. Of 423 concepts from three <b>terminologies,</b> 411 (97 %) were manually cross-mapped by experts to the International Classification for Nursing Practice. The UMLS semantic mapping among the 411 nursing concepts presented 33. 6 % accuracy (i. e., 138 of 411 concepts) when compared to expert cross-mappings. Further research and collaboration among experts in this field are needed for future enhancement of UMLS...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to describe sustainability and whether and how standardized nursing <b>terminologies,</b> in handwritten versus preprinted versus computerized nursing care plans, changed the content and completeness of documented nursing care. Three audits of patient records were performed: a pretest (n = 291) before a yearlong implementation of standardized nursing <b>terminologies</b> in nursing care plans followed by two posttests: (1) 3 weeks after implementation of nursing <b>terminologies</b> (n = 299) and (2) 22 months after implementation of nursing <b>terminologies</b> and 8 months after implementation of a computerized system (n = 281) in a university hospital. Content and completeness of documented nursing care improved after implementation of standardized nursing <b>terminologies.</b> Documentation of nursing care plans, signs and symptoms, related factors, and nursing interventions increased, whereas mean number of nursing diagnoses per patient did not change between audits. Computerized nursing care plans had the biggest impact, with more variety of nursing diagnoses and increased documentation of signs and symptoms, related factors, and nursing interventions.
