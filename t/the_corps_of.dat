5|$|Aluminum {{production}}, shipbuilding, {{and nuclear}} {{production at the}} Hanford site contributed to a rapid increase in regional demand for electricity.

5|$|As {{investigation}} and planning work continued, <b>the</b> <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> Engineers {{reached an agreement}} with the Department of the Interior, the parent agency of the Bureau of Reclamation, in March 1962. The agreement stated the Corps would have responsibility for design and construction of the project, while the Interior Department would be responsible for running and maintaining the dam after completion. In the planning stages, the Interior Department also would be responsible for examining the economic feasibility of the project and its effect upon natural resources. This agreement negated much of the work of the REAB to that point, as the Interior Department promptly began its own three-year study of the dam's economic feasibility and environmental impact. The DRC report, though trumped by the Interior Department's new precedence in such matters, nevertheless released a report in April 1962, stating that the project was economically feasible and would attract new industries to Alaska. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Corps</b> <b>of</b> Engineers continued engineering studies.|$|E
