It is stated that providing global text coherence onyms could represent both denotative coreference and significative coherence of nomination units. The data of the studies have proved that the following units take part in providing <b>text</b> <b>coherency</b> of the novel "The Twelve Chairs" by I. Ilf and E. Petrov: anthroponyms, toponyms, and ergonyms. Having used a frame approach to the proper names analysis the authors could modify and clearly specify a detailed onym functional classification (which is known in linguistics of onyms), pointing to the necessary to distinguish six instead of three groups of onyms according to their functions in providing text coherency: 1) onyms that maintain coherency of the whole text; 2) onyms that construct space-time coordinates of the literary picture of the world; 3) onyms that are both naming the characters who directly interact with the protagonists and designing external relations of the text passage; 4) onyms that organize internal relations of the text passage and represent the main characters of the text passage; 5) onyms that form space-time {{background of the text}} passage; 6) optional onyms, which do not {{play a significant role in}} the <b>text</b> <b>coherency.</b> With the particular examples the authors proved that some onyms could simultaneously perform different functions forming both external and internal links...|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{events are}} central to {{molecular}} biology. An important type of event is the interaction between proteins. PML interacts with Tif 1 alpha (10610177) is a clause that denotes such an interaction. The written language of molecular biology contains discussions of such interactions, their precursers, their ramifications, evidence for them, etc. In the work reported on here, we focus on relations between such protein interactions and other elements. We annotated relations between such clauses and syntactic units either preceeding or following them. We focused on marking <b>text</b> <b>coherency</b> relations, using the inventory of coherency relations discussed in (Kehler, 2002). We discuss how such discourse-level information aids the automatic construction of molecular pathway representations, features of our data set, the discourse annotation exercise we performed, and ways of automating the extraction of such discourse-level information from bioscience literature...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} three research questions: (1) In spite of <b>text</b> <b>coherency</b> and domain knowledge combinations, {{can we expect}} generic question stems to lead to greater measurable outcomes on memory (i. e., textbase model) and learning (i. e., situation model) variables as compared to signal words and/or unguided questioning techniques? (2) Will there be interaction effects on these variables suggesting that combinations of domain knowledge and <b>text</b> <b>coherency</b> are uniquely affected by generic question stems, signal words, or unguided questioning? (3) Will the employment of generic questions stems lead to superior calibration of comprehension scores than those generated by signal words and/or unguided questions conditions? Sixty-three first year psychology students participated in the study. On the basis of pre-determined domain knowledge scores, participants were categorized as high or low domain knowledge. They were then randomly assigned to twelve treatment conditions in a 3 x 2 x 2 cross-factorial design. The first factor was treatment with three levels (i. e., generic question stems, signal words, and unguided questioning); the second factor was domain knowledge with two levels (i. e., high domain knowledge and low domain knowledge); and the third factor was text coherence with two levels (i. e., high text coherence and low text coherence). Participants were administered four measures: a pre- and post-treatment sorting task; a short answer post-test; a summary recall measure; and a calibration of comprehension task. Results {{of this study suggest}} that high domain knowledge and structured questioning strategies are the most reliable predictors of text memory and text learning. Several main effects favouring high domain knowledge arose on text memory, and to a lesser extent, text learning measures. Significant results involving signal words and generic question stems were detected primarily through interaction effects and one main effect. While not always significantly superior, generic question stem participants outperformed their signal word and unguided questioning counterparts on the majority of text memory and text learning variables. Therefore, it appears that generic question stems engage the reader in a deeper level of processing. However, when instructional time is limited, high domain knowledge is necessary for significantly superior text memory and for specific structural connections...|$|E
40|$|ITSs (Intelligent Tutoring Systems) {{provide a}} way of {{addressing}} {{some of the issues}} that the more traditional CAI (Computer Aided Instruction) systems do not address - the individual learning needs and individual learning abilities and levels of users - so that the user is in control of their learning experience. An ITS needs to be able to provide an explanation, for a real world situation, that successfully meets the needs of the user. To ensure relevant explanation content requires the ITS be based on sound planning principles and tutoring knowledge as well as knowledge of the domain and the user. To ensure a coherent explanation structure requires that the tutoring knowledge be applied with full recognition of the knowledge of the domain and the user. For a model of the user's knowledge to be effective, the system should be able to use it to enhance the flexibility and responsiveness of explanations generated. A user model should guide the generation of explanations so they are pitched at the correct level of the user's existing knowledge; models should be able to actively support the needs of the user so that the user's efforts in seeking out information are minimised. The aim of this research is to generate effective, flexible and responsive explanations, in educational software systems, through developing better explanation facilities than exist in currently available ITS software. In achieving this aim, I am advancing research into dialogue planning and user modelling. The explanation facilities described meet the requirements of an explanation that is tailored to the user's needs, a sound theory from which particular explanations are constructed, and a user model that can accurately represent the behaviour and beliefs of the user. My research contributions include explicitly and formally representing discourse planning / reasoning, from both the user's view and the tutor's view so that they can be clearly understood and represented in the ITS. More recent planners have adopted approaches that can be characterised as using adaptations of the classical planning approach, with informally specified planning algorithms and planning languages. Without clear, explicit and full descriptions of actions and the planning algorithm we can not be certain of the plans that such planners produce. I adopt a theoretically rigorous approach based on classical planning theory - the actions available to the planner, the planning language and algorithm should be explicitly represented to ensure that plans are complete and consistent. Classical regression planning uses dynamic planning thus enabling the system to be flexible in a variety of situations and providing the responsiveness required for an ITS. I take a theoretically rigorous approach in constructing a well specified model of discourse, building upon existing research in the area. I present a tutoring module that is able to find a way to motivate the user to take a recommended action, by relating the action to the user's goals, and that is able to reason about the text structure to generate an effective explanation - putting together several clauses of <b>text</b> whilst maintaining <b>coherency.</b> As part of developing such constructs for motivating, enabling and recommending, as well as constructs for structuring text, I use a pedagogic model based on the principled approach of (i) advising the user to take an action (ii) motivating the user to want to take the action and (iii) ensuring the user knows how to do the action. I take a clear and realistic approach to user modelling, making explicit models of the user's behaviour and beliefs. I adopt a theoretically rigorous approach, formally distinguishing between the user's reasoning and their actions, so they can be focused on separately. Formally making this distinction, more easily enables models of the user's reasoning to be tailored to the individual user. To enable the tutor to consider the full impact on the user, of the information to be delivered to the user, I use different plan spaces. I explicitly identify the different perspectives of the user and the tutor so that they can be focused on separately to generate an explanation that is tailored to the user. In my approach, reasoning about the user's skills, rules and knowledge is independent from reasoning about those of the tutor...|$|R
40|$|Problem Statement: Processing texts {{based on}} rhetorical {{structure}} theory has shown interesting results. Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) improves {{the ability of}} extracting the semantic behind the processed text. Different applications such as information retrieval, text summarization, and text generation have proved to give better result using RST. The applicability of RST to process and understand texts has been studied in several languages, but little {{is devoted to the}} Arabic language. Given an Arabic text, the more accurate the Arabic rhetorical relations are extracted the more useful the subsequent text representation will be. This, in turn, leads {{to a better understanding of}} the text and, hence, better results. Approach: We show a framework of applying RST on Arabic language in order to rhetorically parse, understand, and summarize Arabic texts. We discuss a new approach that extracts the Arabic rhetorical relations that is based on studying the English relations, analyzing Arabic corpus and understanding and using the Arabic cue phrases. Results: We obtain rhetorical relations based on Arabic cues. We show how this approach contributes in improving the understanding of the Arabic text. The study addresses the relations that rise from cues that act as connectors among Arabic clauses as well as words. Conclusion: The introduced approach suggests that realizing <b>text</b> <b>coherency</b> in the process of obtaining Arabic rhetorical relations suits the characteristics of the Arabic language and avoids the disadvantages of previous approaches. The obtained Arabic rhetorical relations will make it possible to build rhetorical trees for Arabic texts to apply in text summarization and generation, information retrieval, and text segmentation while preserving the coherency of the text...|$|E
