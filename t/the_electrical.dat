5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons {{are free to}} transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to <b>the</b> <b>electrical</b> conductivity {{is proportional to the}} temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases <b>the</b> <b>electrical</b> resistivity of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.|$|E
5|$|Soluble ionic {{compounds}} like salt {{can easily}} be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions. This is {{a simple way to}} control the concentration and ionic strength. The concentration of solutes affects many colligative properties, including increasing the osmotic pressure, and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the solutes are charged ions they also increase <b>the</b> <b>electrical</b> conductivity of the solution. The increased ionic strength reduces the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>electrical</b> double layer around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E

30|$|The {{distribution}} of potential, electric field, and gradient of square of electric field of pre-patterned Au electrodes was simulated for DEP. The RGOS- and GOS-based electrical circuits were fabricated via DEP assembly. <b>The</b> MEGS-based <b>electrical</b> circuit was also fabricated for comparison. The {{three types of}} circuits have different <b>electrical</b> properties. <b>The</b> MEGS-based <b>electrical</b> circuit possesses <b>the</b> best <b>electrical</b> conductivity, and <b>the</b> GOS-based <b>electrical</b> circuit has <b>the</b> poorest <b>electrical</b> conductivity among <b>the</b> three circuits. For the detection the Cu 2 +, <b>the</b> RGOS-based <b>electrical</b> circuit can detect the Cu 2 + at a concentration as low as 10 nM. <b>The</b> GOS-based <b>electrical</b> circuit can detect the Cu 2 + only after chemical reduction. The water molecules and Cu 2 + ions absorbed {{onto the surface of}} the RGOS play the roles of electron donators and acceptors for the detection. The facile fabrication method and excellent detection performance suggest that <b>the</b> RGOS-based <b>electrical</b> circuit has great potential to be developed into a metal ion sensor.|$|R

40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for processing a wafer comprising a material selected from an electrical semiconducting material and an electrical insulating material is presented. The wafer has opposed generally planar {{front and rear}} sides and a peripheral edge, wherein said wafer is pressed against a pad {{in the presence of}} a slurry to reduce its thickness.
