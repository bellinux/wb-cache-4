500|$|Subsequently, a {{ballistics}} report {{confirms that}} Leight's {{wife and the}} ambassador were killed with the same gun and Leight is arrested. Having solved the case, Monk is allowed to visit Tennyson who remembers being hired {{by a man who}} had six fingers on his right hand. Tennyson asks for forgiveness, but Monk cannot bring himself to give it. He turns off Tennyson's morphine drip saying, [...] "This is me, turning off your morphine;" [...] but a few moments later, he says, [...] "This is Trudy, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>you</b> killed, turning it back on," [...] and does.|$|E
2500|$|Stiffelio confronts Raffaele {{and asks}} {{him what he}} would do if Lina were free, {{offering}} him a choice between [...] "a guilty freedom" [...] and [...] "the future of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>you</b> have destroyed". [...] The younger man does not respond, and the priest tells him to listen to his encounter with Lina from the other room. Stiffelio lays out the reason that their marriage can be annulled (Opposto è il calle che in avvenire - [...] "Opposite are the paths that in future our lives will follow"). Lina's reaction, when presented with the divorce decree, is to swear an ongoing love for her husband ("I will die for love of you"). Appealing to Stiffelio more as a priest than as a husband, Lina confesses that she has always loved him and she still does. [...] Stankar enters to announce that he has killed Raffaele. Jorg tries to convince Stiffelio to come to the church service (Ah sì, voliamo al tempio - [...] "Ah, yes, let us flee to the church").|$|E

6000|$|... "It must be {{reassuring to}} {{you to know that}} you {{certainly}} run no risk of incurring the resentment of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>you</b> come in contact with," [...] I retorted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Cain Ball," [...] said Gabriel restlessly, [...] "can {{you swear}} {{in the most}} awful form that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>you</b> saw was Miss Everdene?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is surely}} {{expedient}} {{you should know}} that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>you</b> have some idea of marrying escaped the divorce court only by the skin of her teeth.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mother,' {{said the}} young man, impatiently, 'he {{would be a}} selfish brute, unworthy alike {{of the name of}} man and of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>you</b> describe, who acted thus.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... “We {{live in such}} {{an amazing}} world. Things that we thought would be science fiction now exist. But fashion, technology, it’s all about life and being <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>you</b> want to be.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You sweat us," [...] he said, {{speaking}} {{between his}} teeth; [...] "you limit us, you stifle us, and away {{there in the}} West-end, <b>you</b> and <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>you</b> keep waste <b>the</b> plunder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Alas! my husband,' she answered, 'the pestilence has {{stricken}} me. Come not near, I pray you, {{come not}} near. Let me be nursed by <b>the</b> <b>women.</b> <b>You</b> shall not risk {{your life for}} me, beloved.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{no better}} thing in the world," [...] John said simply, [...] "than to give every feeling of which you are capable to <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>you</b> love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're content, then, to let <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>you</b> want to {{make your}} wife show herself {{on the stage and}} play the wanton for folks to grin at?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you, Sir: {{the work}} was anonymous, until you saw fit to inscribe my name as its author. Ludlow! Ludlow! how meanly have you thought of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>you</b> profess to love!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is why, {{and it is}} enough. It is hard to give up <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>you</b> love to a black-souled renegade, {{but that}} is not for my thought. What kills me is the horror for her--for her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, sure! Especially {{when one}} of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>you</b> are saving from the burning house gets nervous for fear the flames will reach her, and grabs you by the ear and nearly pulls it off," [...] growled the moving picture actor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go {{over and}} talk with <b>the</b> <b>women,</b> <b>you</b> boys. You can almost see Huahine from Raiatea, and you'll be sure to know some of them. Find out all you can. And {{if any of the}} white men show up, don't start a row." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The fact is, {{you have}} been there and they've talked you over. It can't be that you love {{children}} that you never saw till the other day; and as for <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>you</b> always hated her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She is <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>you</b> love, {{and however}} shady her antecedents, however {{peculiar}} her style of conversation, she is, she must be, blameless. To say more, after so short an acquaintance, might savour of haste and exaggeration.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] she said, {{pinching}} Wiles mischievously, [...] "there! that's <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>you</b> {{were afraid}} of. Look at her. Look at that dress. Ah, Heavens! {{look at that}} shawl. Didn't I tell you she had no style?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let it, then, be Castle Meal," [...] said le Bourdon; [...] "surely, {{if any one}} is to {{be defended}} and {{fortified}} in this way, {{it ought to be}} <b>the</b> <b>women.</b> <b>You</b> may easily palisade that hut, which is so much stronger than this, and so much smaller." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "She told me so. I {{had quite}} a talk with her," [...] Davidson {{informed}} him. [...] "Fancy anyone having a talk with Mrs. Schomberg! If I were to tell the fellows they wouldn't believe me. How did you get round her, Heyst? How {{did you think of}} it? Why, she looks too stupid to understand human speech and too scared to shoo a chicken away. Oh, <b>the</b> <b>women,</b> <b>the</b> <b>women!</b> <b>You</b> don't know what there may be in the quietest of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{seems to}} me <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>you</b> are should be nixie, there is a pool Where we ought to be. You undine-clear and pearly, soullessly cool And waterly The pool for my limbs to fathom, my soul's last [...] school.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certainly. However {{difficult}} I {{may find}} it to persuade myself that Miss Hawtrey is in any way <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>you</b> picture her, I am as convinced as you are that it is absolutely necessary that the money should be paid.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Four, and we'll be five, not {{counting}} <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>you</b> mentioned. I don't think I am {{afraid of the}} Rovers," [...] returned Arnold Baxter. [...] "Besides, can't we get away from them in the dark without their knowing what is up?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>THE</b> OLD <b>WOMAN.</b> <b>You</b> do {{not know}} to whom you are speaking. I am a lady, and a {{faithful}} daughter of the Church.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is we who are wicked, Mr. Brooks," [...] she said, [...] "who spend no end {{of money}} and close our ears to all this. Do take this, will you; can it go to some of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>you</b> know, and <b>the</b> children? There are only five or six pounds there, but I shall talk to mamma. We will send you a cheque." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “The {{surest way to}} {{keep people}} down is to educate the men and neglect <b>the</b> <b>women.</b> If <b>you</b> educate a man you simply educate an individual, but if <b>you</b> educate a <b>woman,</b> <b>you</b> educate a whole nation" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{question}} you wished to ask me," [...] Captain Bayley said, [...] "was, I suppose, whether I {{could give you}} any clue as to who was <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>you</b> took in, and whose child you adopted? She was my daughter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gracious, ain't that {{an awful}} lot of money," [...] exclaimed Davy. [...] "She's <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>you</b> and Diana lit on when you jumped into the spare room bed, ain't she? Diana told me that story. Is that why she left you so much?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Alice Deringham. [...] "I {{think you}} were--for I was only sorry then. And--after {{all that has}} happened--are you not foolish still? I am not <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>you</b> fancy I am, Harry, {{and you know how}} I have wronged you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pierre is my name. Dog is {{the name}} of the dwarf my servant, and as for <b>the</b> old <b>woman,</b> <b>you</b> can call her {{anything}} you like." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "And <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> whom <b>you</b> saw is {{that great}} city which reigns over {{the kings of}} the earth." [...] (Revelation 17:18) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Money. You {{make them}} raise all they can, off'n their friends; and after you've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill them. That's the general way. Only <b>you</b> don't kill <b>the</b> <b>women.</b> <b>You</b> shut up <b>the</b> <b>women,</b> but <b>you</b> don't kill them. They're always {{beautiful}} and rich, and awfully scared. You take their watches and things, {{but you always}} take your hat off and talk polite. They ain't anybody as polite as robbers --you'll see that in any book. Well, <b>the</b> <b>women</b> get to loving you, and after they've been in the cave {{a week or two}} weeks they stop crying and after that you couldn't get them to leave. If you drove them out they'd turn right around and come back. It's so in all the books." ...|$|R
