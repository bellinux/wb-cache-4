5|$|Though child-sized bikinis {{appeared}} in the 1950s, in many European countries, swimsuits under size 11 are commonly not sold with a top part, but in the United States, Britain, and Canada, {{it has often been}} considered unacceptable for girls in late childhood (ages 7–11) to go <b>topless.</b> Several incidents of families being evicted from public pools due to their child being <b>topless</b> have been reported.

Some retailers began to check for ID before selling Oblivion as a result, and one California Assemblyman used the event to criticize the ESRB's inefficiency.|$|E
5|$|At Elizabeth's first {{interrogation}} session, the Japanese {{told her}} that some ships had been sunk in the harbour {{and they wanted to}} know the location of a large amount of money.

They stripped her <b>topless</b> and tied her to the wood so she could not go either forwards or backwards. Then they applied electric shocks to her. They even brought in her husband to let him see her being tortured. After nine months in captivity, Elizabeth had lost half her body weight.|$|E
5|$|Mary's Club is {{the oldest}} strip club in Portland, Oregon, in the United States. In 1954 Roy Keller bought the {{business}} from Mary Duerst Hemming, who owned and operated Mary's as a piano bar beginning in the 1930s.

5|$|Bryant Haliday {{was cast}} in the lead role as Professor Steiner. He was chosen for the role as Gordon was opposed to a British actor playing the title role, and the budget would not allow a Hollywood star to be used. The fact that Gordon was already {{familiar}} with him, as he had cast him in Curse of Simba and Devil Doll, was also a factor. Haliday, a fan of horror movies, enjoyed doing The Projected Man. British stage actress Mary Peach {{was cast in}} the lead role as Dr. Patricia Hill. It was insisted that she be given top billing for her role. Norman Wooland, a German-born British character actor, was cast as Dr. Blanchard, the film's villain.

5|$|In 1981, {{the then}} 68-year-old Takechi {{decided to return}} to film with a series of {{theatrical}} hardcore films, beginning with a remake of his 1964 Daydream, also titled Daydream. Noticing actress Kyōko Aizome in one of her nude photo magazine appearances, Takechi chose her to star in the film. Japan's first theatrically released film featuring hardcore sex, Aizome added to the controversy surrounding the film by admitting to having performed actual sexual intercourse on camera. Though, as Japanese law required, sexual organs and pubic hair were fogged on screen, the Asahi Shimbun called it a breakthrough film, and Japan's first hardcore pornographic movie. Takechi took a novel, yet traditional approach to the fogging by covering the forbidden areas with floating images of <b>topless</b> female shamisen players. Unlike Takechi's earlier Dream of the Red Chamber, the full, uncensored version of Daydream 1981 did survive, and circulated underground in Japan. This uncensored version of the film was released on video at one time in the Netherlands.|$|E

On 19 June 2005, U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey, later United States Attorney General, ruled that Myskina could not stop the distribution of the <b>topless</b> photos, because she had signed a release.

25|$|Several {{recurring}} themes {{can be seen}} within Anger's cinematic work. One of {{the most}} notable of these is homoeroticism; this was first seen in Fireworks (1947), which was based around Anger's own homosexual awakening, and featured various navy officers flexing their muscles, and a white liquid (often thought of as symbolising semen), pouring over the protagonist's body. Similar homoerotic imagery is found in Scorpio Rising (1963), which stars a muscled, <b>topless,</b> leather-clad biker, and Kustom Kar Kommandos (1965), where a young man sensually polishes a car, with close up shots of his tight-fitting jeans and crotch.

25|$|The bikini {{has spawned}} many stylistic variations. A regular bikini is a two-piece {{swimsuit}} that together covers a female's crotch, buttocks, and breasts. Some bikini designs cover larger {{portions of the}} wearer's body while other designs provide minimal coverage. <b>Topless</b> variants are still sometimes considered bikinis, although they are technically not a two-piece swimsuit.|$|E
25|$|In some localities {{strippers}} {{are required}} to obtain permits to work in adult entertainment. During a bikini performance, both breasts and genital areas typically remain covered by revealing attire, while dancers provide services and entertainment. Go-go dancers will retain their tops and bottoms {{for the duration of}} their performance. A female stripper whose upper body is exposed, but whose genital areas remain obscured during a performance, is said to be <b>topless.</b> Strippers who uncover the genital areas along with other clothing during a performance are said to be dancing fully nude. The fully nude practice is banned in many jurisdictions, but many dancers work around these constraints by selective uncovering of the vulva, anus, or both, for short periods of time, followed by immediate replacement of the clothing. Not all strippers are comfortable dancing <b>topless</b> or fully nude.|$|E
