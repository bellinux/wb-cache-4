5|$|Early Europeans {{replaced}} most of {{the original}} Māori names with their own, although they retained some Māori names {{in the north and}} central regions of the North Island. The Royal Geographical Society of London was responsible for place names until 1894 when authority was given to the Governor of New Zealand. Prime Minister Joseph Ward moved an amendment in 1894 that gave preference to Māori names for any new features and allowed misspelt names to be altered (although this did not always occur). In 1924 the Honorary Geographic Board of New Zealand was set up to advise on place names, and in 1946 the New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) was established and given power <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>or</b> implement Māori and English names. Anyone can propose a geographical name to the board, who consult local Māori and allow public submissions before determining if the name should be made official. Names can also be made official through an Act of Parliament and the NZGB is required to keep a public list of all the official New Zealand geographical names.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between sleep and memory has been postulated and studied {{since at least}} the early 19th century. Memory, the cognitive process whereby experiences, learning and recognition are recalled, is a product of brain plasticity, the structural changes within synapses that create associations between stimuli. Stimuli are encoded within milliseconds; however, the long-term maintenance of memories can take additional minutes, days, or even years to fully consolidate and become a stable memory (more resistant <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>or</b> interference). Therefore, the formation of a specific memory occurs rapidly, but the evolution of a memory is often an ongoing process.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that any of these assumptions are correct, or even likely. Linguistic opinion is that click consonants may well be a relatively late development in human language, that they are no more resistant <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>or</b> any more likely to be linguistic relics than other speech sounds, and that they are easily borrowed: at least one Khoisan language, ǁXegwi, is believed to have reborrowed clicks from Bantu languages, which had earlier borrowed them from Khoisan languages, for example. The Knight and Mountain article {{is the latest in a}} long line of speculations about the primitive origin of click consonants, which have been largely motivated by the outdated idea that primitive people speak primitive languages, which has no empirical support.|$|E
25|$|In 1994 Anglia Television was {{acquired}} by finance and media group MAI, and subsequently became part of United Broadcasting & Entertainment, with Survival and Partridge Films linked in a natural history production business called United Wildlife. The mid-1990s saw a shift of emphasis in ITV towards presenter-led wildlife shows, notably those featuring Steve Irwin and Nigel Marven. Survival Specials continued to be commissioned, and generally achieved good audience ratings, although as stand-alone programmes in an increasingly volatile schedule, their slots were vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>or</b> cancellation. Survival broke with tradition and engaged an on-camera presenter when Gaby Roslin fronted a six-part series of half-hour shows in 1995 under the title Predators, screened by ITV in a Sunday evening slot. Despite good ratings, however, a second series was not commissioned.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the first}} time since the 1989–90 NFL playoffs that neither conference {{championship}} game took place in the Eastern or Central time zone. During that season, the Conference Championship Games were changed from the then-traditional starting times of 12:30p.m. and 4:00p.m. to 1:30p.m. and 5:00p.m. EST respectively. This was to accommodate the fact that the Denver Broncos and San Francisco 49ers hosted the 1989–90 AFC and NFC Championship Games in the Mountain Time Zone and Pacific Time Zone, respectively — thus avoiding a locally played game at 9:30a.m. PST/10:30a.m. MST, but also forcing the networks <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>or</b> move their prime time lineups in a moment's notice. When the league changed the traditional starting times for the 2002–03 NFL playoffs to 3 p.m. and 6:30p.m. EST, it eliminated the future possibility of having to reschedule.|$|E

25|$|Doubts about Muralitharan's action persisted, however. On the 1998–99 tour to Australia he {{was once}} again called for {{throwing}} by Ross Emerson during a One Day International against England at the Adelaide Oval in Australia. The Sri Lankan team almost abandoned the match, but after instructions from the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka, the game resumed. The Sri Lankan captain at the time Arjuna Ranatunga, was later fined and given a suspended ban from the game as a result. It later emerged {{that at the time}} of this match Emerson was on sick leave from his non-cricket job due to a stress-related illness and he stood down for the rest of the series. Muralitharan was sent for further tests in Perth and England and was cleared again. At no stage was Muralitharan requested <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>or</b> remodel his action, by the ICC. Up to this point in his career (1999) Muralitharan primarily bowled two types of deliveries, namely the off-break and the topspinner. He had not yet mastered the doosra.|$|E
25|$|Once Mehmed {{had created}} an Ottoman {{bureaucracy}} and transformed the empire from a frontier society to a centralized government, {{he took care}} to appoint officials who would help him implement his agenda. His first grand vizier was Zaganos Pasha, who was of devşirme background {{as opposed to an}} aristocrat, and Zaganos Pasha’s successor, Mahmud Pasha Angelović, was also of devşirme background. Mehmed was the first sultan who was able to codify and implement kanunname solely based on his own independent authority. Additionally, Mehmed was able to later implement kanunname that went again previous tradition or precedent. This was monumental in an empire that was so steeped in tradition and could be slow <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>or</b> adapt. Having viziers and other officials who were loyal to Mehmed was an essential part of this government because he transferred more power to the viziers than previous sultans had. He delegated significant powers and functions of government to his viziers as part of his new policy of imperial seclusions. A wall was built around the palace as an element of the more closed era, and unlike previous sultans Mehmed was no longer accessible to the public or even lower officials. His viziers directed the military and met foreign ambassadors, two essential parts of governing especially with his numerous military campaigns.|$|E
25|$|A few knots {{have become}} more or less {{standard}} for attaching the {{various parts of the}} fly lines and backing, etc., together. A detailed discussion of most of these knots is available in any good book on fly fishing. Some of the knots that are in most every fly angler's arsenal are: the improved clinch knot which is commonly used to attach the fly to the leader, the overhand slip knot or arbor knot which is used to attach the backing to the spool, the albright knot which can be used to attach the fly line to the backing. A loop can also be put in fly line backing using a bimini twist. Often, a loop is added to the business end of the fly line to facilitate the connection to the leader. This loop may take one of several forms. It may be formed by creating a loop in the end of the fly line itself or by adding a braided loop or a loop of monofilament nylon (as in Gray's Loop). Alternatively, a single length of monofilament nylon, or fluorocarbon, may be tied {{to the end of the}} fly line using a nail or tube knot or a needle knot. A loop can then be tied at the end of this monofilament butt length or butt section using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, to which the tapered or untapered leader, also looped using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, may in turn be connected via a loop to loop connection. The use of loop to loop connections between the fly line and the leader provides a quick and convenient way <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>or</b> replace a tapered leader. Many commercially produced tapered leaders come with a pre-tied loop connection.|$|E
