5000|$|The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) <b>test</b> <b>guideline</b> has {{developed}} specific tests to test toxicity level in organisms. Ecotoxicological studies are generally performed {{in compliance with}} international guidelines, including EPA, OECD, EPPO, OPPTTS, SETAC, IOBC, and JMAFF.|$|E
50|$|The {{applicable}} guidelines are the (OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals, EU Test Methods), {{and other such}} methods.

30|$|The {{appropriateness}} of the OECD <b>test</b> <b>guidelines</b> {{as well as other}} guidelines for nanomaterials has been reviewed and it is generally accepted that most endpoints are adequate and relevant also for ENMs [29]. Some modifications of the test procedures are required [4] and currently for some of the OECD <b>test</b> <b>guidelines</b> nanospecific guidance is drafted as well as some new OECD <b>test</b> <b>guidelines</b> are being developed.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper charts {{the almost}} ten years of history of OECD's work on nanosafety, during which the {{programme}} of the OECD on the Testing and Assessment of Manufactured Nanomaterials covered the testing of eleven nanomaterials for about 59 end-points addressing physical–chemical properties, mammalian and environmental toxicity, environmental fate and material safety. An overview of the materials tested, the test methods applied and the discussions regarding {{the applicability of the}} OECD <b>test</b> <b>guidelines,</b> which are recognised methods for regulatory testing of chemicals, are given. The results indicate that many existing OECD <b>test</b> <b>guidelines</b> are suitable for nanomaterials and consequently, hazard data collected using such guidelines will fall under OECD's system of Mutual Acceptance of Data (MAD) which is a legally binding instrument to facilitate the international acceptance of information for the regulatory safety assessment of chemicals. At the same time, some OECD <b>test</b> <b>guidelines</b> and guidance documents need to be adapted to address nanomaterials while new <b>test</b> <b>guidelines</b> and guidance documents may be needed to address endpoints that are more relevant to nanomaterials. This paper presents examples of areas where <b>test</b> <b>guidelines</b> or guidance for nanomaterials are under development...|$|R

50|$|Animal-rights and animal-welfare groups, such as Animal Rights International, have campaigned against LD50 {{testing on}} animals. Several countries, {{including}} the UK, have {{taken steps to}} ban the oral LD50, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) abolished the requirement for the oral test in 2001 (see <b>Test</b> <b>Guideline</b> 401, Trends in Pharmacological Sciences Vol 22, February 22, 2001).|$|E
5000|$|In {{comparison}} to the older [...] test developed in 1927, this procedure produces similar results while using fewer animals and causing less pain and suffering. As a result, in 1992 this test was proposed {{as an alternative to}} the LD50 test by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development under OECD <b>Test</b> <b>Guideline</b> 420. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has begun to approve non-animal alternatives in response to research cruelty concerns and the lack of validity/sensitivity of animal tests as they relate to humans.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{replace the}} Draize skin {{irritation}} assay (OECD guideline 404) several test methods based on {{reconstructed human epidermis}} (RHE) have been developed and were adopted in the OECD <b>test</b> <b>guideline</b> 439. However, all validated test methods in the guideline are linked to RHE provided by only three companies. Thus, the availability of these test models {{is dependent on the}} commercial interest of the producer. To overcome this limitation and thus to increase the accessibility of in vitro skin irritation testing, an open source reconstructed epidermis (OS-REp) was introduced. To demonstrate the capacity of the OS-REp in regulatory risk assessment, a catch-up validation study was performed. The participating laboratories used in-house generated OS-REp to assess the set of 20 reference substances according to the performance standards amending the OECD <b>test</b> <b>guideline</b> 439. Testing was performed under blinded conditions. The within-laboratory reproducibility of 87 % and the inter-laboratory reproducibility of 85 % prove a high reliability of irritancy testing using the OS-REp protocol. In addition, the prediction capacity was with an accuracy of 80 % comparable to previous published RHE based test protocols. Taken together the results indicate that the OS-REp test method {{can be used as a}} standalone alternative skin irritation test replacing the OECD <b>test</b> <b>guideline</b> 404...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{method for}} assessing {{acute oral toxicity}} (OECD <b>Test</b> <b>Guideline</b> 401) was designed to identify the median lethal dose (LD 50), using the death of animals as an endpoint. Introduced as an alternative method (OECD <b>Test</b> <b>Guideline</b> 420), the Fixed Dose Procedure (FDP) relies on the observation of clear signs of toxicity, uses fewer animals and causes less suffering. More recently, the Acute Toxic Class method and the Up-and-Down Procedure have also been adopted as OECD test guidelines. Both of these methods also use fewer animals than the conventional method, although they still use death as an endpoint. Each of the three new methods incorporates a sequential dosing procedure, which results in increased efficiency. In 1999, {{with a view to}} replacing OECD <b>Test</b> <b>Guideline</b> 401, the OECD requested that the three new test guidelines be updated. This was to bring them in line with the regulatory needs of all OECD Member Countries, provide further reductions in the number of animals used, and introduce refinements to reduce the pain and distress experienced by the animals. This paper describes a statistical modelling approach for the evaluation of acute oral toxicity tests, by using the revised FDP for illustration. Opportunities for further design improvements are discussed...|$|E

30|$|The {{need for}} {{revising}} current OECD <b>test</b> <b>guidelines</b> {{and the development}} of new ones was discussed by experts from science, industry and regulatory bodies at an OECD workshop on ecotoxicology and environmental fate of ENMs in 2013. An overview on the discussions and recommendations is given in Kühnel and Nickel [4]. The main subjects which have to be considered in the adaptation of the ecotoxicological <b>test</b> <b>guidelines</b> are spiking of terrestrial and aquatic test systems and the exposure of organisms in aquatic systems. For ENMs available as a powder, it has to be decided whether application via stock suspension (wet application) or via powder (dry application) is recommended. For aquatic tests, important issues were discussed at a workshop and recently published [22].|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{method for}} the assessment of acute dermal toxicity (OECD <b>Test</b> <b>Guideline</b> 402, 1987) uses death of animals as an endpoint to identify the median lethal dose (LD 50). A new OECD Testing Guideline called the dermal fixed dose procedure (dermal FDP) is being prepared to provide an alternative to <b>Test</b> <b>Guideline</b> 402. In contrast to <b>Test</b> <b>Guideline</b> 402, the dermal FDP does not provide a point estimate of the LD 50, but aims to identify that dose of the substance under investigation that causes clear signs of nonlethal toxicity. This is then used to assign classification according to the new Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling scheme (GHS). The dermal FDP has been validated using statistical modelling rather than by in vivo testing. The statistical modelling approach enables calculation of the probability of each GHS classification and the expected numbers of deaths and animals used in the test for imaginary substances with a range of LD 50 values and dose-response curve slopes. This paper describes the dermal FDP and reports the results from the statistical evaluation. It is shown that the procedure will be completed with considerably less death and suffering than guideline 402, and will classify substances either in the same or a more stringent GHS class than that assigned {{on the basis of the}} LD 50 value...|$|E
