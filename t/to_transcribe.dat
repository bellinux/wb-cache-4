5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these will be used <b>to</b> <b>transcribe</b> any one language. It is possible <b>to</b> <b>transcribe</b> speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which sounds are described in {{a great deal of}} detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription. Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand, and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the letters}} themselves, {{there are a}} variety of {{secondary}} symbols which aid in transcription. Diacritic marks can be combined with IPA letters <b>to</b> <b>transcribe</b> modified phonetic values or secondary articulations. There are also special symbols for suprasegmental features such as stress and tone that are often employed.|$|E

5|$|All episodes were {{released}} on DVD in the UK between 2006 and 2008 by Replay DVD.

Craig Robins put up £30,000 of his own money to buy the rights and produced the series one disc.

5|$|Around 1760, Jones hired Samuel Dew of Richmond County {{to serve}} as his deputy clerk. Dew apprenticed under Jones for 21 years, {{occasionally}} performing duties as acting clerk.

According to Maxwell and Swisher, Jones relied upon his deputy clerks, such as Dew, <b>to</b> <b>transcribe</b> and document court proceedings, which Jones traveled among the various counties to sign.|$|E

5|$|Colonial orthography {{is marked}} {{by the use of}} c for /k/ (always hard, as in cic /kiik/), k for /q/ in Guatemala or for /k’/ in the Yucatán, h for /x/, and tz for /ts/; the absence of glottal stop or vowel length (apart {{sometimes}} for a double vowel letter for a long glottalized vowel, as in uuc /u’uk/), the use of u for /w/, as in uac /wak/, and the variable use of z, ç, s for /s/. The greatest difference from modern orthography, however, is in the various attempts <b>to</b> <b>transcribe</b> the ejective consonants.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar was an {{important}} transoceanic trading hub connecting ports of the Indian Ocean in the early centuries following human settlement. The written history of Madagascar began with the Arabs, who established trading posts along the northwest coast by at least the 10th century and introduced Islam, the Arabic script (used <b>to</b> <b>transcribe</b> the Malagasy language in a form of writing known as sorabe), Arab astrology, and other cultural elements. European contact began in 1500, when the Portuguese sea captain Diogo Dias sighted the island. The French established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The Antemoro soon {{developed}} a reputation as powerful sorcerers and astrologers, in large part owing to their monopoly on knowledge of writing, termed sorabe, which uses the Arabic script <b>to</b> <b>transcribe</b> the Malagasy language. Antemoro ombiasy (astrologer sages) migrated throughout the island, where they practiced their arts for local communities, served as advisers to kings, and even founded new principalities. This Antemoro mobility and their creation {{of a network of}} powerful spiritual advisers across the island is credited with forcing an awareness among Malagasy of communities beyond their own and sparking a sense of a common Malagasy identity. The Antemoro kingdom was disbanded in the late 19th century following an uprising of the Antemoro commoners against the noble class.|$|E

5000|$|The English /ti(ː)/ and /tɪ/ is {{typically}} <b>transcribed</b> <b>to</b> チ chi (e.g. チーム chīmu [...] "team"), but ティ ti {{is also used}} (ティア tia [...] "tear"). The suffix -tic can be <b>transcribed</b> <b>to</b> either チック -chikku or ティック -tikku. However, -ty is almost always <b>transcribed</b> <b>to</b> ティ(ー) -ti(i), not *チ(ー) *-chi(i) (e.g. パーティー pātī [...] "party", インフィニティ infiniti [...] "infinity").|$|R
5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes <b>to</b> <b>transcribe</b> information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the instruments, the term taiko also refers to the performance itself, and commonly to one style called kumi-daiko, or ensemble-style playing (as opposed to festival performances, rituals, or theatrical use of the drums). Kumi-daiko was developed by Daihachi Oguchi in 1951. He is considered a master performer and helped transform taiko performance from its roots in traditional settings in festivals and shrines. Oguchi was trained as a jazz musician in Nagano, and at one point, a relative gave him an old piece of written taiko music. Unable to read the traditional and esoteric notation, Oguchi found help <b>to</b> <b>transcribe</b> the piece, and on his own added rhythms and transformed the work to accommodate multiple taiko players on different-sized instruments. Each instrument served a specific purpose that established present-day conventions in kumi-daiko performance.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{artist and}} {{engraver}} Agostino Aglio, starting in 1826, {{became the first}} <b>to</b> <b>transcribe</b> and illustrate the codex completely for Lord Kingsborough, who published it in his nine volumes of Antiquities of Mexico in 18311848. The codex then had some damage due to handling, sunlight, and moisture. It received direct water damage that was significantly destructive from being kept in a flooded basement during the bombing of Dresden in World War II. German historian G. Zimmerman noted that the damage was extreme on pages 2, 4, 24, 28, 34, 38, 71 and 72. Certain details of the glyph images have been lost because of this. This shows when the current codex is compared to the Kingsborough copies of 1831-1848 and the Förstemann facsimile editions of 1880 and 1892.|$|E

40|$|Different {{steps in}} gene {{expression}} are intimately linked. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the conserved TREX complex couples transcription to nuclear messenger RNA (mRNA) export. However, {{it is unknown}} how TREX is recruited <b>to</b> actively <b>transcribed</b> genes. Here, we show that the Prp 19 splicing complex functions in transcription elongation. The Prp 19 complex is recruited <b>to</b> <b>transcribed</b> genes, interacts with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and TREX, and is absolutely required for TREX occupancy at transcribed genes. Importantly, the Prp 19 complex is necessary for full transcriptional activity. Taken together, we identify the Prp 19 splicing complex as a novel transcription elongation factor that is essential for TREX occupancy at transcribed genes and that thus provides a novel link between transcription and messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) formation...|$|R
