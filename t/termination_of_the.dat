40|$|We present <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> {{calculations}} of surface relaxations, energetics, and bonding properties for CaTiO 3 (001) and (011) surfaces using a hybrid B 3 PW description of exchange and correlation. We consider both CaO and TiO 2 <b>terminations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> non-polar (001) surface, and Ca, TiO and O <b>terminations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polar (011) surface. On the (001) surfaces, {{we find that}} all upper-layer atoms relax inwards on the CaO-terminated surface, while outward relaxations of all atoms in the second layer are found for both terminations. For the TiO 2 -terminated (001) surface, the largest relaxations are on the second-layer atoms. The surface rumpling is much larger for the CaO-terminated than for the TiO 2 -terminated (001) surface, but their surface energies are quite similar at 0. 94 eV and 1. 13 eV respectively. In contrast, different <b>terminations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> (011) CaTiO 3 surface lead to very different surface energies of 1. 86 eV, 1. 91 eV, and 3. 13 eV for the O-terminated, Ca-terminated, and TiO-terminated (011) surface respectively. Our results for surface energies contrast sharply with those of Zhang et al. [Phys. Rev. B 76, 115426 (2007) ], where the authors found a rather different pattern of surface energies.

5|$|By October 1963, {{according}} to Woods, {{the situation had}} become critical and some officials were beginning to examine alternative options, such as conventional fighter aircraft {{in the form of}} the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. By November1963, the RAF reportedly still found the P.1154 to be a suitable platform, while the Royal Navy appeared to be considering the F-4 Phantom II as being a better fit for its needs. In response, HSA elected focused its efforts on the RAF version. In late 1963, dissatisfied with the progress of the 'bi-service' model, the government examined three alternative options for the programme; to proceed with an RAF-orientated P.1154 while the Naval version would be delayed, pursue the development of a full dual-service P.1154 model with only limited differences between the services, or the complete <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program with the service's requirements to be re-appraised.|$|E

40|$|Coughing protects and {{clears the}} airways and lungs of inhaled irritants, particulates, pathogens, and {{accumulated}} secretions. An initial urge to cough, {{and an almost}} binary output suggests gating mechanisms that encode and modulate this defensive reflex. Whether this “gate” has a physical location for the physiological barrier it poses to cough is unknown. Here we describe a critical component to cough gating, <b>the</b> central <b>terminations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cough receptors. A novel microinjection strategy defined coordinates for microinjection of glutamate receptor antagonists that nearly abolished cough evoked from the trachea and larynx in anesthetized guinea pigs while having no effect on basal respiratory rate and little or no effect on reflexes attributed to activating other afferent nerve subtypes. Comparable microinjections in adjacent brainstem locations (0. 5 – 2 mm distal) were without effect on coughing. Subsequent transganglionic and dual tracing studies confirmed that <b>the</b> central <b>terminations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cough receptors and their primary relay neurons are found bilaterally within nucleus tractus solitarius (nTS), lateral to the commissural subnucleus and perhaps in the medial subnuclei.

Their localization should facilitate more mechanistic studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> encoding and gating of cough. —Canning, B. J., Nanako Mori.
