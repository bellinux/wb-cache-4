I went away and started designing my response to this. After our first meeting I was excited by her ideas and collaborating {{with people who have}} a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear view of what she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part of this, I knew it would be interesting and fun to work together.|$|E

Producer Michael G noted that [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] was particularly difficult to arrange for reggae, saying [...] "There are songs like 'Paranoid Android', which flips between 4/4 time and 7/8 time about 13 <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> also {{had to think about}} other ways to reinterpret those parts with horns, melodica, organ... it was a great challenge." ...|$|E

Hamilton said after the game: [...] "To score for my hometown team at Wembley {{has got to be}} one of the best feelings ever." [...] Kamara added: [...] "Now I am hungry for second helpings of success. And I am absolutely convinced I can get it here. We will not look out of place in the First Division because we have so much quality." [...] County's manager Colin Murphy told the press: [...] "All credit to Bradford, they won it fair and square. And that does not always happen in football. Bradford are a very experienced side compared to mine. Maybe this came a year too early for my boys." [...] Jacobs, the Bradford full-back who played 11 years for the club and won a subsequent promotion to the Premier League, said after his career: [...] "I just look back on some amazing <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was delighted to be part of them. It was a real blessing to my life. To play at Wembley was a dream fulfilled." ...|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} [...] "B–" [...] and {{concluded}} that, [...] "I did jump a few <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> liked Haley's dour malevolence, but overall, the new Nightmare on Elm Street is a by-the-numbers bad dream that plays {{a little too much}} like a corporately ordered rerun. One, two, Freddy's coming for you. Three, four, we've been there before". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the acting calling it [...] "lethargically lifeless" [...] and criticized Haley's portrayal of Krueger, saying, [...] "Even with his electronically deepened voice and a pointless amount of backstory, there's just no replacing Englund". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1 star out of 4, writing in his review, [...] "I stared at A Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation. The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. So what? Are we supposed to be scared? Is the sudden clanging chord supposed to evoke a fearful Pavlovian response?".|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Eminem {{mentioned}} the singer twice on The Eminem Show, his fourth studio album, {{on the tracks}} [...] "Superman" [...] and [...] "When the Music Stops", {{both of which were}} revealed to have been inspired by their relationship in Eminem's 2008 autobiography, The Way I Am. The former track contained the lyrics [...] "What you trying be? My new wife? / What, you Mariah? Fly through twice," [...] while the latter suggested that he begged to be taken back by Carey. Later that year, Eminem confirmed that they had been in a relationship in an interview for Rolling Stone, but claimed to have not been fully committed to it and that he disliked her as a person, while Carey told Maxim that it was never a [...] "sexual relationship" [...] and interviewer Larry King [...] "I hung out with him, I spoke to him on the phone. I think I was probably with him a total of four <b>times.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> don't consider that dating somebody." [...] Carey recorded a song called [...] "Clown" [...] for Charmbracelet which [...] "ambiguously addressed the relationship" [...] with the lyrics [...] "Should've left it at I like your music too" [...] and [...] "You should've never intimated we were lovers/ When you know very well we never even touched each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|The play was...expressionistic, that is, realistic-expressionistic.

[...] There was a tension that could only be resolved by an outcry... was perhaps one of the last dramas to be played expressionisitically.|$|E
2500|$|In a September 2008 {{interview}} with Rock N Roll Experience, guitarist Rick Wartell mentioned that Trouble has written [...] "eight or nine songs" [...] {{for their next}} album, and would begin recording it after touring. When asked which direction is the new music going in, Wartell replied, [...] "I know people have said this a million <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> know you've heard this a million times, but it's pretty fucking heavy, let's put it that way!

2500|$|In 1985 James Baldwin {{described}} {{the impact of}} Delaney on his life, saying he was [...] "the first living proof, for me, that a black man could be an artist. In a warmer time, a less blasphemous place, {{he would have been}} recognised as my Master and I as his Pupil. He became, for me, an example of courage and integrity, humility and passion. An absolute integrity: I saw him shaken many <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> lived to see him broken but I never saw him bow." [...] He further wrote, [...] "Perhaps I should not say, flatly, what I believe – that he is a great painter – among the very greatest; but I do know that great art can only be created out of love, and that no greater lover has ever held a brush." ...|$|E

2500|$|Byrd {{later called}} joining the KKK [...] "the {{greatest}} mistake I ever made." [...] In 1997, {{he told an}} interviewer he would encourage young people {{to become involved in}} politics but also warned, [...] "Be sure you avoid the Ku Klux Klan. Don't get that albatross around your neck. Once you've made that mistake, you inhibit your operations in the political arena." [...] In his last autobiography, Byrd explained that he was a KKK member because he [...] "was sorely afflicted with tunnel vision—a jejune and immature outlook—seeing only what I wanted to see because I thought the Klan could provide an outlet for my talents and ambitions." [...] Byrd also said in 2005, [...] "I know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand <b>times...</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't mind apologizing over and over again. I can't erase what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Queensrÿche is {{the first}} album by the band to feature a vocalist other than Tate, {{sparking}} concerns with some fans that the sound will be too drastically {{different from what they}} were used to. New vocalist La Torre said in a late March 2013 interview that Tate always was [...] "a huge inspiration" [...] to him as a fan of the band, and he always tries to honor what Tate did vocally: [...] "I try to represent [...] {{to the best of my}} ability, but I also do put [...] a little bit of my flavor, which is a little edgier and a little grittier at <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> try to be authentic but me at the same time." [...] La Torre especially sought to provide a [...] "common thread" [...] in the vocals, that he felt was missing from the previous few records released by Queensrÿche.|$|E
2500|$|... "Dweller on the Threshold" [...] and [...] "Aryan Mist" [...] are {{credited}} {{to the religious}} writings of Alice Bailey. Her book discusses the New Age ideas of [...] "glamours" [...] or [...] "mental illusions", which formed a fog that covers the [...] "spiritual warrior" [...] and the [...] "Aryan race" [...] from the world. When the [...] "dweller on the threshold" [...] was covered with {{the light of the}} soul or [...] "Angel of Presence" [...] illumination came. Some of these ideas were quoted in the two Morrison compositions, both co-written with Hugh Murphy. In 1982 Morrison revealed in an interview: [...] "I've read Glamour four or five <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> get different things out of it each time. 's saying a lot of things. It's depth reading. You might read it on Wednesday and on Thursday you pick it up again and get an entirely different thing.

2500|$|The {{daylight}} hours {{were filled with}} fleas, lice, flies, mice and delousing. [...] "Every morning and whenever there is a spare minute, everyone takes off their shirts and opens their trousers to hunt for lice ... This louse hunting is quite a part of life." [...] One triumph was recorded, [...] "Bill I've had a regular Melbourne Cup Day. I've turned my bally breeches inside out and outside in 45 blithering <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have broken the blighters little hearts." [...] On the King's birthday, 3 June, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade marched to Khan Yunis, where a steam disinfecting plant on the railway {{had been set up}} to delouse their clothes. The [...] "clothes were placed in a big portable oven and literally baked ... to kill the bugs and lice." [...] While the clothes were thus cleaned, a deep hole was made, over which a ground sheet or tarpaulin was placed, where the men could wash under a shower consisting of a [...] "tin drum on top of a wooden scaffold erected," [...] often the first opportunity to do so [...] "for many weeks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bernhardt had a {{remarkable}} ability to memorize a role quickly. She recounted in L'Art du Théâtre that [...] "I {{only have to}} read a role two or three <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> know it completely; but the day that I stop playing the piece the role escapes me entirely... My memory can't contain several parts at the same time, and it's {{impossible for me to}} recite off-hand a tirade from Phèdre or Hamlet. And yet I can remember the smallest events from my childhood." [...] She also suffered, particularly early in her career, bouts of memory loss and stage fright. Once, she was seriously ill before a performance of L'Etrangére at the Gaiety Theater in London, and the doctor gave her a dose of painkiller, either opium or morphine. During the performance, she went on stage, but could not remember what she was supposed to say. She turned to another actress, and announced, [...] "If I made you come here, Madame, it is because I wanted to instruct you in what I want done... I have thought about it, and I do not want to tell you today", then walked offstage. The other actors, astonished, quickly improvised an ending to the scene. After a brief rest, her memory came back, and Bernhardt went back on stage, and completed the play.|$|E
2500|$|By 2000, DeVille had cured his two-decades-long {{addiction}} to heroin. He relocated to Cerrillos Hills, New Mexico, where he produced and played on an album, Blue Love Monkey, with Rick Nafey, {{a friend from}} his youth in Connecticut who had played in DeVille's first band, Billy & the Kids, as well as The Royal Pythons. In New Mexico, DeVille's wife Lisa committed suicide by hanging; DeVille discovered her body. He said:I got {{in a car accident}} because I got crazy. I think I was somewhat taunting death because somebody who I loved very much died. And I found them. That's what that lyric in that song means ("she hurts me still since I cut her down" [...] ). I cut her down. Next thing you know the police show up, I was in tears... I was in love with another woman and we were going through some hard <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> got in the car and I wanted to go off the cliff. I was in the mountains in New Mexico... They came right around the corner head on. You know how big a Dodge Ram truck is? I broke my arm in three places and my knee went into the dash board... It was bone to bone...
