2500|$|<b>Triplatin</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> (rINN; {{also known}} as BBR3464) is a platinum-based {{cytotoxic}} drug that underwent clinical trials {{for the treatment of}} human cancer. The drug acts by forming adducts with cellular DNA, preventing DNA transcription and replication, thereby inducing apoptosis. [...] Other platinum-containing anticancer drugs include cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Triplatin</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> {{contains}} three platinum centres {{linked by}} amine ligands. [...] Other ligands {{attached to this}} coordination complex, include chloride. [...] Its invention arose from earlier work showing that diplatinum analogues of cisplatin were cytotoxic. BBR3464 was patented in the mid-1990s and was originally licensed to the pharmaceutical company Roche. In preclinical trials, it demonstrated cytotoxic activity in cancer cell lines that had either intrinsic or acquired resistance to cisplatin. On this basis it entered Phase I (Toxicity) clinical trials {{under the auspices of}} Novuspharma before the rights were transferred to Cell Therapeutics. [...] It is currently undergoing Phase II (Efficacy) trials with mixed results. So far trials of the drug with patients suffering from ovarian cancer, small cell lung cancer and gastric or gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinomas {{have been reported in the}} literature.|$|E
