5|$|After {{the release}} of Results May Vary, Limp Bizkit joined the band Korn on a tour called the Back 2 Basics Tour. The Back 2 Basics Tour, which was {{sponsored}} by Xbox, was scheduled for November 2003. However, during a concert at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom, Durst was hit by an object thrown from the crowd. Durst finished the remaining two songs of Limp Bizkit's set and after the concert, Durst had seven stitches administered by a private physician. During the end of 2003, Limp Bizkit cancelled their tour dates in Southeast Asia after there was a United States Department of State warning of increased security threats abroad. Limp Bizkit planned to play shows in Bali, Bangkok and Manila. However, after a terrorist bombing in Istanbul, Turkey occurred, the United States Department of State issued a <b>travel</b> <b>advisory,</b> and Limp Bizkit cancelled the shows in Southeast Asia. Although they did not perform in Southeast Asia, Limp Bizkit did perform in South Korea and Japan. In January 2004, there were rumors that Limp Bizkit were going to tour with the rock band Kiss, although the band was unable to, citing scheduling conflicts.|$|E

40|$|The {{projected}} {{situation as}} it relates to risk has not been widely addressed, yet it remains in our view a key problematic in the communication of risk. In this chapter we focus on how risk situation is projected in the field of international travel. The right to travel is increasingly hampered by a heightened concern over risk. In the global risk environment the ‘prudential traveller’ is the ‘informed traveller’ and a core aspect of this information process is the issuing of a particular type of risk communication account to travellers, known as <b>travel</b> <b>advisories.</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>advisories</b> are key risk communication technologies, through which a risk communicator renders visible the risk situation evident in particular countries to ‘the traveller’. <b>Travel</b> <b>advisories</b> essentially enable governments to assert some form of control or influence over the destinations their citizens may travel to and as such are motivated in their design to influence the traveller’s decision-making processes. The issue we consider in this chapter is how <b>travel</b> <b>advisories</b> linguistically direct the traveller to evaluate the risks involved in travelling to a particular country. Our discussion proceeds from an analysis of a small corpus of Travel Advice texts taken from the ‘Smart Travellers Website’ (Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade). 17 page(s...|$|R
