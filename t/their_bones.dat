5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing <b>their</b> <b>bones</b> to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E
5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, <b>their</b> <b>bones</b> are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E
5|$|Depending on maturity, breed, {{and work}} expected, horses are usually put under saddle and {{trained to be}} ridden {{between the ages of}} two and four. Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries, horses {{specifically}} bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because <b>their</b> <b>bones</b> and muscles are not solidly developed. For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60calendar months (five years) old.|$|E

If an animal (or human) eats only C3 plants, their δ13C values will be from −18.5 to −22.0‰ in <b>their</b> <b>bone</b> collagen and −14.5‰ in the hydroxylapatite of <b>their</b> teeth and <b>bones.</b>|$|R

50|$|NR2F6 impairs the {{formation}} of mature red blood cells in animals that over-express NR2F6 in <b>their</b> <b>bone</b> marrow. Mice that over expression of NR2F6 in <b>their</b> <b>bone</b> marrow cells have a block at the pro-erythroblast stage of blood cell development both in the bone marrow and in the spleen of animals that have excessive expression of NR2F6. So, when inhibition of differentiation of stem cell is desired, inhibition of differentiation is achieved through induction of increased NR2F6 activity. In situations where differentiation of stem cells into a cell of increased maturity is desired, inhibition of NR2F6 activity must be performed.|$|R
5|$|While most temnospondyls are aquatic {{in early}} stages of life, most metoposaurids {{appear to have been}} {{terrestrial}} in their juvenile stage. Like other Mesozoic temnospondyls, adult metoposaurids were adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle. <b>Their</b> <b>bones</b> are not highly developed for movement on land. The cross-sectional thickness of limb bones in adult metoposaurids shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial locomotion. Juvenile individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this stress, and could probably move about on land. To maintain a terrestrial lifestyle, a temnospondyl's limb bones would have to thicken with positive allometry, meaning that they would grow at a greater rate {{than the rest of the}} body. This is not the case in metoposaurids, meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Anatomical dissections of two brown {{pelicans}} in 1939 {{showed that}} pelicans have {{a network of}} subcutaneous air sacs under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat, breast and undersides of the wings, as well as having air sacs in <b>their</b> <b>bones.</b> The air sacs {{are connected to the}} airways of the respiratory system, and the pelican can keep its air sacs inflated by closing its glottis, {{but it is not clear}} how air sacs are inflated. The air sacs serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water and may also cushion the impact of the pelican's body on the water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish. Superficial air sacs may also help to round body contours (especially over the abdomen where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position) to enable the overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{occurs in}} 15 to 30 people per 100,000 {{in the general}} {{population}} each year. Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active adolescents. Because <b>their</b> <b>bones</b> are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents {{can be attributed to the}} bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. Franz König coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an inflammation of the bone–cartilage interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, osteonecrosis, accessory ossification center, osteochondrosis, and hereditary epiphyseal dysplasia. Some authors have used the terms osteochondrosis dissecans and osteochondral fragments as synonyms for OCD.|$|E

5000|$|Bone age is {{the degree}} of {{maturation}} of a child's bones. As a person grows from fetal life through childhood, puberty, and finishes growth as a young adult, {{the bones of the}} skeleton change in size and shape. These changes can be seen by x-ray. The [...] "bone age" [...] of a child is the average age at which children reach this stage of bone maturation. A child's current height and bone age can be used to predict adult height. For most people, <b>their</b> <b>bone</b> age is the same as their biological age but for some individuals, <b>their</b> <b>bone</b> age is a couple years older or younger. Those with advanced bone ages typically hit a growth spurt early on but stop growing early sooner while those with delayed <b>bone</b> ages hit <b>their</b> growth spurt later than normal. Kids who are below average height do not necessarily have a delayed bone age; in fact <b>their</b> <b>bone</b> age could actually be advanced which if left untreated, will stunt their growth.|$|R

5|$|Reptiles are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. <b>Their</b> <b>bones</b> are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian {{but there is a}} septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Textiles dyed with royal purple, {{a symbol}} of social status, {{were found in the}} royal hypogeum. Judging by the royal statues found in the royal hypogeum antechamber, a king of Qatna wore clothes {{different}} from those worn in Mesopotamia; his robes would have reached his ankles and the hem on his shawl {{would have been in the}} shape of a thick rope, while his beard was short and his headdress consisted of a broad band. For royal primary burials, several steps were followed: constructing the burial container, anointing the body with oil, heating the body, leading the burial procession, laying the sarcophagus floor with textiles, burying the body with another layer of textiles, and finally depositing a layer of plants and herbs. Elephants, which lived in western Syria, were esteemed in Qatna and connected to the royal family; they were apparently hunted by the royals and the king himself, as there is evidence that <b>their</b> <b>bones</b> were displayed in the palace; thus, elephants were part of the royal ideology and hunting an elephant was {{a symbol of}} prestige that glorified the strength of the king.|$|E
5|$|The Talara Tar Seeps in Peru {{represent}} a similar scenario, and have also produced fossils of Smilodon. Unlike in La Brea, {{many of the}} bones were broken or show signs of weathering. This may have been because the layers were shallower, so the thrashing of trapped animals damaged the bones of previously trapped animals. Many of the carnivores at Talara were juveniles, possibly indicating that inexperienced and less fit animals had a greater chance of being trapped. Though Lund thought accumulations of Smilodon and herbivore fossils in the Lagoa Santa Caves were due to the cats using the caves as dens, these {{are probably the result}} of animals dying on the surface, and water currents subsequently dragging <b>their</b> <b>bones</b> {{to the floor of the}} cave, but some individuals may also have died after becoming lost in the caves.|$|E

5|$|The {{aim of the}} ducker was to {{get every}} {{duckling}} as fat as possible {{by the age of}} eight weeks (the first moult, the age at which they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up <b>their</b> <b>bones</b> or make their flesh greasy. In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high-protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all poultry, ducks require grit in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether carbamazepine, sodium valproate or phenobarbital as monotherapy in ambulatory epileptic children with adequate sun exposure have some effect on <b>their</b> <b>bone</b> metabolism based on the determination of total serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels and its bone isoenzyme activity. Blood samples were obtained from 118 epileptic children (37 on carbamazepine, 47 on sodium valproate and 34 on phenobarbital) and from corresponding healthy controls matched for age, gender and anthropometric parameters. AP and its liver, bone and intestinal isoenzyme levels, other common biochemical markers of bone and liver metabolism and drug levels were measured in the study participants. Patients on carbamazepine or phenobarbital had significantly elevated AP levels accompanied by increased bone and liver isoenzyme activity compared to controls. An increase of bone AP isoenzyme values, correlated with the duration of treatment (r= 0. 49, P= 0. 002), was found in children on sodium valproate without, however, a concomitant significant elevation of total AP values. We conclude that children who receive antiepileptic drugs as monotherapy, even when residing in a Mediterranean country with adequate sunlight, may have <b>their</b> <b>bone</b> metabolism affected {{as indicated by the}} elevated levels of bone AP isoenzyme. This isoenzyme, but not total AP values, could therefore be used as a marker for the selection of patients who would be benefited by a thorough evaluation of <b>their</b> <b>bone</b> metabolism profile...|$|R
