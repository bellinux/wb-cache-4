5|$|Amanita muscaria {{poisoning}} {{has occurred}} in young children and in people who ingested <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms</b> for a hallucinogenic experience. Occasionally it has been ingested in error, because immature button forms resemble puffballs. The white spots sometimes wash away during heavy rain and <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms</b> then {{may appear to be}} the edible A.caesarea.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the molds Sepedonium ampullosporum, S.laevigatum, and S.chalcipori. In Sepedonium infections, a {{white to}} powdery yellow mold covers {{the surface of}} the fruit body. <b>The</b> <b>mushrooms</b> are a food source and rearing habitat for several insect species, {{including}} the fungus gnats Mycetophila fisherae and M.signatoides, and flies such as Pegomya winthemi and species of the genera Sciophila and Mydaea. The cottontail rabbit species Sylvilagus brasiliensis has been recorded feeding on <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms</b> in Costa Rica.|$|E
5|$|Xeromphalina setulipes is {{only known}} from the type {{locality}} {{in the province of}} Ciudad Real, Spain. Members of the Mycenaceae are saprotrophic, and X.setulipes was found in woodland made up of cork oak (Quercus suber) and Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea), with undergrowth consisting of gum rockrose (Cistus ladanifer), prickly juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus), and various heathers (Erica species). <b>The</b> <b>mushrooms</b> were growing in clusters on the forest floor from acid soil, surrounded by dead plant matter. The species's ecological patterns may be useful identifying characteristics, distinct from other, similar species. <b>The</b> <b>mushrooms</b> were found in autumn, and collected in November.|$|E
2500|$|The {{recoverable}} edible fungi are the agaric [...] ("virno"), <b>the</b> field <b>mushroom</b> ("petranùgliu"), <b>the</b> craterellus ("scardarella"), chanterelle ("gaglinella"), <b>the</b> honey <b>mushroom</b> ("chiuìttu"), <b>the</b> cauliflower <b>mushroom</b> ("retélla"), <b>the</b> parasol <b>mushroom,</b> <b>the</b> Caesar's <b>mushroom,</b> <b>the</b> {{penny bun}} or boletus edulis and others not {{picked up by}} the inhabitants.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mushroom</b> is {{an unusual}} monolithic, mushroom-shaped, red {{sandstone}} rock formation known as a hoodoo. <b>The</b> <b>mushroom</b> shape was caused by wind, humidity, and water erosion over centuries. <b>The</b> <b>Mushroom</b> is surrounded by copper ore smelting sites from between the 14th and 12th centuries BCE.|$|R
5000|$|Because of <b>the</b> taste, <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> {{has been}} called chicken polypore and chicken-of-the-woods. Many people think that <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> tastes like crab or lobster. <b>The</b> authors of <b>Mushrooms</b> in Color said that <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> tastes good sauteed in butter or {{prepared}} in a cream sauce served on toast or rice. It is highly regarded in Germany and North America.|$|R
5|$|Amanita regalis is poisonous. A case of {{poisoning}} {{was reported}} from Finland, where three individuals {{believed they had}} consumed the edible parasol mushroom Macrolepiota procera. The symptoms of poisoning, which began 1–2hours after ingestion of <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> were gastrointestinal—nausea and heavy vomiting. Two had central nervous system manifestations and cholinergic symptoms, including hallucinations, confusion, or loss of consciousness as well as profuse salivation and sweating. All three individuals recovered within 4–24hours without any damage to liver, kidneys or the central nervous system. As this incident demonstrates, cooking <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms</b> does not completely neutralize the toxic components of Amanita regalis. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains ibotenic acid and muscimol, the same toxic constituents as Amanita muscaria.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius funalis {{is known}} only from Kawasaki, Kanagawa and Machida, Tokyo, Japan. Mushrooms grow in groups on dead plant matter, {{and have been}} {{recorded}} on Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) wood and leaf litter in woodland mostly made up of Chonowski's hornbeam (Carpinus tschonoskii) and bamboo-leaf oak (Quercus myrsinifolia). <b>The</b> <b>mushrooms</b> can be encountered from May to July.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances (adopted in 1971) {{requires}} {{its members}} to prohibit psilocybin, and parties to the treaty are required to restrict use of the drug to medical and scientific research under strictly controlled conditions. However, <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms</b> containing the drug were not specifically included in the convention, due largely to pressure from the Mexican government.|$|E
5000|$|Stowaway to <b>the</b> <b>Mushroom</b> Planet is <b>the</b> {{second in}} <b>the</b> series of <b>Mushroom</b> Planet books by Eleanor Cameron, and was {{published}} in 1956, two years after The Wonderful Flight to <b>the</b> <b>Mushroom</b> Planet.|$|R
5000|$|Super Mario Bros. 3 {{takes place}} in the [...] "Mushroom World," [...] a {{collection}} of seven different kingdoms ruled by independent kings. In the Mario comic books, the physical appearance of <b>the</b> <b>Mushroom</b> King is based on that of the king of Grassland, which is why some people equate it with <b>the</b> <b>Mushroom</b> Kingdom. However, it is unclear what the precise relationship is. The instruction manual for the game states that Bowser had taken over <b>the</b> <b>Mushroom</b> Kingdom, and that <b>the</b> <b>Mushroom</b> Kingdom is a gateway to <b>the</b> <b>Mushroom</b> World, but this is never elaborated upon in Super Mario Bros. 3 or in any other games. As a monarchy, <b>the</b> <b>Mushroom</b> Kingdom does not appear to hold democratic elections, is seemingly entirely governed by the Princess, and is consequently often in a state of chaos during her frequent absences when she is kidnapped.|$|R

5|$|Two {{derivatives}} of ergosterol {{have been}} {{isolated from the}} fruit bodies of T.plumbeoviolaceus: tylopiol A (3β-hydroxy-8α,9α-oxido-8,9-secoergosta-7,9(11),22-triene) and tylopiol B (3β-hydroxy-8α,9α-oxido-8,9-secoergosta-7,22dien-12-one). These sterols are unique to this species. Additionally, the compounds ergosta-7,22-dien-3β-ol, uridine, allitol, ergosterol, ergosterol5α,8α-peroside, ergothioneine, adenosine, and uracil have been identified from <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms.</b>|$|E
5|$|Agaricus hondensis {{mushrooms}} are toxic, and consuming the fruit bodies causes gastroenteritis. Some fruit bodies smell of creosote, an odor that {{becomes even more}} prevalent if <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms</b> are cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor. The fruit bodies are used as food by the vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) and the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Relatively high levels of the chemical hydroquinone are present in fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is valued}} for its peppery flavor and eaten after {{suitable}} preparation in Russia and Finland, {{the species is}} highly irritating to the digestive system when eaten raw. The toxins, also responsible for the strongly bitter or acrid taste, are destroyed by cooking. Studies have identified several chemicals present in <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> including ergosterol and derivatives thereof, and the pungent-tasting velleral.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mushroom</b> Council {{was created}} {{as part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Mushroom</b> Promotion, Research & Consumer Information Act of 1990 which {{was signed into law}} on November 28, 1990, by President George H.W. Bush. <b>The</b> <b>Mushroom</b> Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Order, part of the act that created <b>the</b> <b>Mushroom</b> Council, did not {{actually}} take effect until January 8, 1993. The delay in implementation was due to a comment period and a referendum among growers and importers to authorize the checkoff program. Another referendum on whether or not to continue the program was held in 1998. About 70 percent of producers and importers cast a ballot in the referendum and continuing <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> checkoff program was approved by 80 percent.|$|R

50|$|Young {{specimens}} are edible if {{large amounts}} of a clear watery liquid comes out of it. <b>The</b> <b>mushroom</b> should not be eaten raw. Deer like to eat <b>the</b> <b>mushroom.</b>|$|R
5|$|Amanita ocreata, {{commonly}} known as the death angel, destroying angel, angel of death or more precisely western North American destroying angel, is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus, one of many in the genus Amanita. Occurring in the Pacific Northwest and California floristic provinces of North America, A. ocreata associates with oak trees. The large fruiting bodies (<b>the</b> <b>mushrooms)</b> generally appear in spring; the cap may be white or ochre and often develops a brownish centre, while the stipe, ring, gill and volva are all white.|$|E
5|$|Crinipellis zonata is saprobic, {{living on}} the debris or roots of hardwoods; it {{contains}} wood-decaying enzymes that can break down the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene. <b>The</b> <b>mushrooms</b> grow individually or in small clusters, {{and can be found}} between August and September. In North America, it is distributed east of the Rocky Mountains, and has been recorded as far west as Indiana and Texas. In Europe, it has been collected in Portugal. It has also been collected in South Korea.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, American {{cartoonist}} Charles Burns authored X'ed Out, {{a graphic}} novel {{with a variety}} of allusions to The Adventures of Tintin. In one scene, the protagonist Nitnit discovers a warehouse containing white eggs with red spots, akin to <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms</b> in The Shooting Star, with the cover of Burns' book paying homage to Hergé. In 2015, the original front cover sketch of the book was sold for €2.5million to a European investor, Marina David of Petits Papiers-Huberty-Breyne, at the Brussels Antiques and Fine Art Fair.|$|E
50|$|The {{distribution}} of radiation in <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> cloud varies with yield of the explosion, type of weapon, fusion/fission ratio, burst altitude, terrain type, and weather. In general, lower-yield explosions have about 90% of their radioactivity in <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> head and 10% in the stem. In contrast, megaton-range explosions {{tend to have}} most of their radioactivity in the lower third of <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> cloud.|$|R
50|$|Potassium hydroxide: When <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> {{comes in}} contact with {{potassium}} hydroxide, the most of <b>the</b> <b>mushroom,</b> including <b>the</b> mantle and ectomycorrhizae, loses its bluish hue and becomes a dull brown.|$|R
50|$|Lactarius rubrilacteus {{has many}} laticifers which {{appear as a}} white network {{across the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>mushroom.</b> When sliced or cut, <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> flesh will {{typically}} release a dark red to purple latex or milky substance. The flesh itself will lose colour when damaged, and is usually granular or brittle to the touch. The stem is quite thin, being only several centimetres in any dimension, and is of an average size and shape for a <b>mushroom.</b> <b>The</b> fungus itself exudes a slight odour that is faintly aromatic. While it is not known if <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> would be edible, small taste tests reveal that <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> is mild to slightly bitter.|$|R
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} {{mycorrhizal}} association with willow trees, {{and it is}} for this that the species is named. However, particular species favoured by the fungus are unclear and may include beech and alder taxa. <b>The</b> <b>mushrooms</b> grow from the ground, often among mosses or detritus. I.saliceticola was first described in 2009, and within the genus Inocybe, the species {{is a part of the}} section Marginatae. The species has been recorded in Finland and Sweden and is relatively common in some areas.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many species}} of the genus Suillus, S.brevipes is edible, and the {{mushroom}} is considered choice by some. The odor is mild, and the taste mild or slightly acidic. Field guides typically recommended to remove the slimy cap cuticle, and, in older specimens, the tube layer before consumption. <b>The</b> <b>mushrooms</b> are common in the diet of grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park.|$|E
5|$|Most of the gyromitrin must {{be removed}} to render false morels edible. The {{recommended}} procedure involves either first drying and then boiling <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom {{it is recommended that}} they are cut into small pieces and parboiled twice in copious amounts of water, at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water. Each round of parboiling reduces the gyromitrin contents to a tenth. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of boiling. Drying <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms</b> can also reduce the concentration of gyromitrin; ten days of open air desiccation leads to the loss of 90% of gyromitrin. However it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.|$|E
50|$|In the flaccida {{form the}} upper surface is matt and silky and <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> {{as a whole}} is flaccid. In the inversa form the surface is shiny and <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> is rigid.|$|R
25|$|Fungi produce {{mushrooms}} as part {{of their}} sexual reproduction. Within <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> diploid cells are formed, later dividing into haploid spores—the height of <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> aids <b>the</b> dispersal of these sexually produced offspring.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Bass's Planetoid is a 1958 children's {{science fiction}} novel by Canadian author Eleanor Cameron. The novel {{followed}} The Wonderful Flight to <b>the</b> <b>Mushroom</b> Planet (1954) and Stowaway to <b>the</b> <b>Mushroom</b> Planet (1956).|$|R
5|$|Psilocybe pelliculosa {{is found}} in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada, where it grows on the ground in groups or {{clusters}} along trails or forest roads in coniferous woods. A single collection has also been reported from Finland. <b>The</b> <b>mushrooms</b> contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and baeocystin, although at relatively low concentrations. Several mushroom species that are similar in appearance to P.pelliculosa can be distinguished by subtle differences {{in the form of the}} fruit body, or by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|R. Gordon Wasson {{recounted the}} details of these deaths, noting the {{likelihood}} of Amanita poisoning. In the case of Clement VII, the illness {{that led to his}} death lasted five months, making the case inconsistent with amatoxin poisoning (p.110). Natalia Naryshkina is said to have consumed a large quantity of pickled mushrooms prior to her death. It is unclear whether <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms</b> themselves were poisonous or if she succumbed to food poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} composition of fruit bodies collected from Turkey has been analyzed, and the dried fruit bodies determined {{to contain the}} following nutritional components: protein, 19.46%; fat, 3.65%; ash, 32.51%; carbohydrates, 44.38% (including 6.71% as non-digestible cellulose). Fresh fruit bodies have a moisture content of 84.4%. <b>The</b> <b>mushrooms</b> are {{a good source of}} the element vanadium, shown in a 2007 study to be present at a concentration of 0.142mg/kg (dry weight).|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>mushroom</b> is edible {{and has a}} sweet taste. [...] While {{the species}} is edible, old {{mushrooms}} may be spongy and soft inside. The species is high in nutrition {{and can be used}} for cooking. The authors of North American mushrooms: a field guide to edible and inedible fungi said that <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> has a pleasant odor. A Field Guide to Mushrooms: North America says that <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> {{is one of the best}} to eat and has a sweet flavor that is especially appealing to some people. David Arora, <b>the</b> author of <b>Mushrooms</b> demystified: a comprehensive guide to the fleshy fungi, said that <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> can be sauteed and served for dessert.|$|R
50|$|In {{the insect}} brain, the peduncles of <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> bodies extend through the midbrain. They are mainly {{composed}} of the long, densely packed nerve fibres of the Kenyon cells, the intrinsic neurons of <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> bodies. These cells have been found in <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> bodies of all species that have been investigated, though their number varies; for example fruit flies have around 2,500 whereas cockroaches have about 200,000.|$|R
5000|$|Interactions {{between the}} {{pathogen}} {{and the host}} in the casing layer can either result in stipe blow-out or dry bubble. Early infections can cause stipe blow-out in which part of the fruit body of <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> becomes deformed, accompanied by splitting or peeling of the stipe tissue. L. fungicola also causes totally deformed and undifferentiated white masses of mushroom. If inoculation occurs in the late stage of <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> life cycle, symptoms include small necrotic lesions on the cap of <b>the</b> <b>mushroom.</b> Other symptoms may include brown, light brown, or gray discolorations on the cap or the stipe of <b>the</b> <b>mushroom.</b> Infection by L. fungicola does not decrease the weight of <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> crop, but {{has the potential to}} decrease the total number of mushrooms produced. [...] Therefore, dry bubble is thought of mainly as a cosmetic disease.|$|R
