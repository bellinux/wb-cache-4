50|$|After the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, the two superpowers {{agreed to}} install a direct hotline between Washington D.C. and Moscow (the {{so-called}} red <b>telephone),</b> <b>enabling</b> leaders of both countries to quickly {{interact with each other}} in a time of urgency, and reduce the chances that future crises could escalate into an all-out war. The U.S./U.S.S.R. détente was presented as an applied extension of that thinking. The SALT II pact of the late 1970s continued the work of the SALT I talks, ensuring further reduction in arms by the Soviets and by the U.S. The Helsinki Accords, in which the Soviets promised to grant free elections in Europe, has been called a major concession to ensure peace by the Soviets.|$|R

5000|$|Also {{referred}} to as [...] "over-the-phone interpreting," [...] "telephonic interpreting," [...] and [...] "tele-interpreting," [...] <b>telephone</b> interpreting <b>enables</b> interpretation via <b>telephone.</b> The interpreter is added to a conference call. Telephone interpreting {{may be used in}} place of on-site interpreting when no on-site interpreter is readily available at the location where services are needed. However, it is more commonly used for situations in which all parties who wish to communicate are already speaking to one another via telephone (e.g. telephone applications for insurance or credit cards, or telephone inquiries from consumers to businesses).|$|R
5000|$|Dictaphone also {{developed}} [...] "endless loop" [...] recording using magnetic tape, {{introduced in the}} mid-seventies as the [...] "Thought Tank". The recording medium {{did not need to}} be moved from where the dictation took place to the location such as a typing pool where the typists were located. This was normally operated via a dedicated in house <b>telephone</b> system <b>enabling</b> dictation to be made from a variety of locations within the hospital or other organizations with typing pools. One version calculated each typists' turnaround time and allocated the next piece of dictation accordingly.|$|R

5000|$|When {{building}} work began, César Ritz and Auguste Escoffier {{were employed}} by Richard D'Oyly Carte as manager and {{chef de cuisine}} respectively at the Savoy Hotel. They were already planning to set up independently, and had established the Ritz Hotel Development Company, when Carte dismissed them both in 1897 for financial irregularities. After successfully opening the Hôtel Ritz in Paris the following year, Ritz agreed to take a 72-year Crown lease of the new hotel in London. A limited company, The Carlton Hotel, Limited, was formed. The name Carlton comes from Carlton House, the nearby former home of the Prince Regent. The company's prospectus stated: The Hotel has been erected from plans approved by the Crown, and decorated and equipped by Messrs. Waring and Gillow, Limited. It contains upwards of 250 bed and sitting rooms, which are arranged both en suite and separately, and decorated and furnished in 18th century English and French styles. Private bath rooms {{are attached to the}} suites, and there is also ample general accommodation in this respect, there being altogether about 80 bath rooms. In addition to smoking, reading, dining, reception, and retiring rooms … the Hotel contains a Palm Courton the ground floor. … Each bed room is fitted with a <b>telephone</b> <b>enabling</b> visitors to communicate with any part of the hotel service, or to be switched on to the trunk line. Hair-dressing rooms, boy messenger service, theatre box office and every other adjunct of an hotel of the very highest order are provided.|$|R
5000|$|A call {{originating}} from a telephone {{fitted with a}} black box would still be charged for by the telephone company unless some method to circumvent the call charging was deployed. Black boxes were commonly built by phone phreaks during the 1960s to 1980s (and in some places like Eastern Europe, well into the 2000s) {{in order to provide}} callers with free telephone calls. Sometimes several friends would incorporate a black box into each of their <b>telephones</b> to <b>enable</b> them to hold long conversations with each other without having to pay for them. Another use of black boxes were in the incoming modems of computers running bulletin board systems that were popular back in the 1980s and early 90s.|$|R

40|$|Summary: An {{essential}} {{aspect of}} telephone {{use by the}} general public is its role at key moments in family life: marriage, divorce or separation, birth, childhood events, illness and death. Usually an event is announced by telephone; a letter or a telegram is considered less appropriate, at least for the more immediate family members. While any <b>telephone</b> conversation <b>enables</b> interlocutors to maintain their relationships, the announcement by phone of an event relevant to the family emphasises them. One telephones to announce an event, to inquire about another's well-being, to reassure a family member, to provide support and to be, in a sense, present. Akers-Porrini Ruth. The telephone visit.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} which land line telephone and/or mobile/cellular <b>telephone</b> will <b>enable</b> an individual with a cochlear implant to achieve the best speech discrimination scores. Objective measurements and the subjective experience of the individual were used. The literature review provided an overview on the telephone abilities of individuals fitted with cochlear implants. In this study three factors, the quality of the telephone, the speaker's voice and different speech-coding strategies, were discussed and examined, in order to explore and explain the technical difficulties commonly experienced by this population regarding the successful use of a telephone. Data regarding various telephones and the influence different voice-types has on the telecommunication abilities were obtained through the execution of the methodology. Telephone abilities on five different telephones were assessed. Ten participants, four females and six males, fitted with the ESPrit 22, ESPrit 24 and ESPrit 3 G Nucleus cochlear implants were used. The Central Institute for the Deaf (CID) open-set sentences were used and data was statistically analysed using a split plot design. Significant differences between different types of telephones were found. The results also suggested that different voice types have an impact on these individual's ability to use a telephone independently. Possible reasons such as different coding strategies, technical interference and quality of voices were discussed. Recommendations for developing rehabilitation programs, to obtain successful telephone competence for these individuals, were made and discussed. The study aimed to empower technologists working in this field to actively take note of the need for development and continuous research regarding various telephones. These <b>telephones</b> should <b>enable</b> more individuals fitted with cochlear implants to receive the maximum speech discrimination with the minimum interference. The findings of this study should encourage future research regarding this topic. A more extensive range of telephones should be used and compared to the findings in this study.
