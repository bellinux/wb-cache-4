40|$|B cell epitopes of the {{measles virus}} fusion protein were mapped, by {{reacting}} sera from late convalescent donors with synthetic overlapping pentadecapeptides, segments covering the whole F protein sequence. Unselected individual sera recognized 7 to 20 % of the <b>total</b> sequence. <b>Cumulation</b> of the binding patterns of 30 sera identified eight to 10 clusters of antibody-binding peptides pread {{over most of}} the sequence. The B cell epitopes included regions of transition between the more hydropathic (including the N-terminal end of the F 1 and F 2 protein) and hydrophilic sequences. When the regions of antibody binding were compared with the predicted secondary structure of the F protein, no detectable pattern became apparent. Exposed sequences as well as sequences hidden in the viral membrane or in the protein core of both the F 1 and F 2 polypeptides were recognized by the antibodies. The heterogeneity of the binding patterns was not merely dependent on the anti-measles virus titre. The import-ance of antibodies recognizing linear epitopes of the measles virus fusion protein for the immune protection is presently not known...|$|R
