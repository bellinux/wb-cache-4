[...] (I am of the conviction that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> great cultural struggle) He repeated this term in a call for vote by the German Progress Party on 23 March 1873.

2500|$|The {{top quark}} interacts {{primarily}} by the strong interaction, but can only decay through the weak force. [...] It decays to a W boson and either a bottom quark (most frequently), a strange quark, or, on the rarest of occasions, a down quark. [...] The Standard Model predicts its mean lifetime to be roughly [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> twentieth of the timescale for strong interactions, and therefore it does not form hadrons, giving physicists {{a unique opportunity to}} study a [...] "bare" [...] quark (all other quarks hadronize, meaning that they combine with other quarks to form hadrons, and can only be observed as such). Because it is so massive, the properties of the top quark allow predictions to be made of the mass of the Higgs boson under certain extensions of the Standard Model (see Mass and coupling to the Higgs boson below). As such, it is extensively studied as a means to discriminate between competing theories.|$|E
2500|$|Although Joe Budden and Raekwon {{reportedly}} were {{sat down}} and forced to settle things {{on the final day}} of the tour, Budden released a video on his website challenging Raekwon to a one-on-one fight, and called on all his fans to help persuade Raekwon to accept, despite the fact that it wasn't Raekwon who threw the punch. Raekwon however did not accept, and explained that he is a grown man with a family, and that fighting would be childish. He also stated [...] "This has never ever been a Wu-Tang versus Slaughterhouse thing, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> kid who gets off on doing blogs. My thing is this, I'm a business man, I'm here to make money, take care of my family and keep as many people safe and sound as possible. We not gonna take it there 'cause that's little shit, we are grown men. I will never jump out the window to sacrifice the situation with my family for something that ain't worth it". Since the incident, Budden has stated in interviews the feud was over, and Raekwon made a similar announcement during a show, stating that he [...] "had love" [...] for Joe Budden.|$|E
2500|$|In the US, Suede never {{matched the}} {{moderate}} {{success of the}} first album. This was {{partly due to the}} mix-up over the band's name and partly because Dog Man Star [...] "was one of the most pretentious albums ever released by a major label," [...] according to music journalist Rob Sheffield. Dog Man Star has sold 36,000 copies in the US as of 2008 according to Nielsen SoundScan. By comparison, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> third of the sales of Suede, which shifted 105,000 units. In contrast to the first album, Dog Man Star had a mixed critical reception in the US. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice was keen on Suede's debut album, however he rated Dog Man Star a [...] "dud" [...] in his consumer guide review. Likewise, Entertainment Weekly were less enthused. Chuck Eddy said: [...] "the band that used to be Suede comes off affected and dull." [...] Steve Hochman of the Los Angeles Times expressed similar views, saying that [...] "Suede's 1993 debut held promise, but this one looks backward instead of forward." [...] However, on the contrary some critics saw the album as a step forward. Simon Reynolds of The New York Times felt that the band [...] "soars to new heights of swoony hysteria," [...] in contrast to the first album, which targeted a small audience with its glam sound. In conclusion, he said: [...] "Dog Man Star deserves attention, if only for its absurd ambition." ...|$|E
