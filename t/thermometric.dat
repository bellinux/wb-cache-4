25|$|Thomson, W. (Lord Kelvin) (1848). On an {{absolute}} <b>thermometric</b> scale founded on Carnot's {{theory of the}} motive power of heat, and calculated from Regnault's observations, Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc. (1843/1863) 1, No. 5: 66–71.|$|E
25|$|There are {{important}} exceptions. They break the obviously apparent link between heat and temperature. They {{make it clear}} that empirical definitions of temperature are contingent on the peculiar properties of particular <b>thermometric</b> substances, and are thus precluded from the title 'absolute'. For example, water contracts on being heated near 277K. It cannot be used as a <b>thermometric</b> substance near that temperature. Also, over a certain temperature range, ice contracts on heating. Moreover, many substances can exist in metastable states, such as with negative pressure, that survive only transiently and in very special conditions. Such facts, sometimes called 'anomalous', are some {{of the reasons for the}} thermodynamic definition of absolute temperature.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} these restrictions, most {{generally}} used practical thermometers are of the empirically based kind. Especially, it was used for calorimetry, which contributed greatly {{to the discovery of}} thermodynamics. Nevertheless, empirical thermometry has serious drawbacks when judged as a basis for theoretical physics. Empirically based thermometers, beyond their base as simple direct measurements of ordinary physical properties of <b>thermometric</b> materials, can be re-calibrated, by use of theoretical physical reasoning, and this can extend their range of adequacy.|$|E
25|$|All of these, the commonest cases, {{fit with}} {{a rule that}} heating can be {{measured}} by changes of state of a body. Such cases supply what are called <b>thermometric</b> bodies, that allow the definition of empirical temperatures. Before 1848, all temperatures were defined in this way. There was thus a tight link, apparently logically determined, between heat and temperature, though they were recognized as conceptually thoroughly distinct, especially by Joseph Black in the later eighteenth century.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of {{measurement}} of high temperatures, another factor was important, and used by Josiah Wedgwood in his pyrometer. The temperature reached in a process was estimated by the shrinkage of a sample of clay. The higher the temperature, the more the shrinkage. This was the only available more or less reliable method of measurement of temperatures above 1000°C. But such shrinkage is irreversible. The clay does not expand again on cooling. That is why it could be used for the measurement. But only once. It is not a <b>thermometric</b> material in the usual sense of the word.|$|E
25|$|Empirically based {{temperature}} scales rely {{directly on}} measurements of simple physical properties of materials. For example, {{the length of}} a column of mercury, confined in a glass-walled capillary tube, is dependent largely on temperature, and is the basis of the very useful mercury-in-glass thermometer. Such scales are valid only within convenient ranges of temperature. For example, above the boiling point of mercury, a mercury-in-glass thermometer is impracticable. Most materials expand with temperature increase, but some materials, such as water, contract with temperature increase over some specific range, and then they are hardly useful as <b>thermometric</b> materials. A material is of no use as a thermometer near one of its phase-change temperatures, for example its boiling-point.|$|E
25|$|It {{is framed}} {{in terms of}} an {{idealized}} device called a Carnot engine, imagined to define a continuous cycle of states of its working body. The cycle is imagined to run so slowly that at each point of the cycle the working body {{is in a state of}} thermodynamic equilibrium. There are four limbs in such a Carnot cycle. The engine consists of four bodies. The main one is called the working body. Two of them are called heat reservoirs, so large that their respective non-deformation variables are not changed by transfer of energy as heat through a wall permeable only to heat to the working body. The fourth body is able to exchange energy with the working body only through adiabatic work; it may be called the work reservoir. The substances and states of the two heat reservoirs should be chosen so that they are not in thermal equilibrium with one another. This means that they must be at different fixed temperatures, one, labeled here with the number 1, hotter than the other, labeled here with the number 2. This can be tested by connecting the heat reservoirs successively to an auxiliary empirical <b>thermometric</b> body that starts each time at a convenient fixed intermediate temperature. The <b>thermometric</b> body should be composed of a material that has a strictly monotonic relation between its chosen empirical <b>thermometric</b> variable and the amount of adiabatic isochoric work done on it. In order to settle the structure and sense of operation of the Carnot cycle, it is convenient to use such a material also for the working body; because most materials are of this kind, this is hardly a restriction of the generality of this definition. The Carnot cycle is considered to start from an initial condition of the working body that was reached by the completion of a reversible adiabatic compression. From there, the working body is initially connected by a wall permeable only to heat to the heat reservoir number 1, so that during the first limb of the cycle it expands and does work on the work reservoir. The second limb of the cycle sees the working body expand adiabatically and reversibly, with no energy exchanged as heat, but more energy being transferred as work to the work reservoir. The third limb of the cycle sees the working body connected, through a wall permeable only to heat, to the heat reservoir 2, contracting and accepting energy as work from the work reservoir. The cycle is closed by reversible adiabatic compression of the working body, with no energy transferred as heat, but energy being transferred to it as work from the work reservoir.|$|E

2500|$|In 1848, William Thomson, {{who later}} was made Lord Kelvin, {{wrote in his}} paper, On an Absolute <b>Thermometric</b> Scale, {{of the need for}} a scale whereby [...] "infinite cold" [...] (absolute zero) was the scale's null point, and which used the degree Celsius for its unit increment. Kelvin {{calculated}} that absolute zero was equivalent to −273°C on the air thermometers of the time. This absolute scale is known today as the Kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale.

The {{power or}} force which makes {{combustible}} gas or vapour abandon its elastic state {{in contact with}} a solid, that it may cover the latter with a thin stratum of its own proper substance, is considered as being neither attraction nor affinity. It is able also to extend liquids and solids in concrete laminæ {{over the surface of}} the acting solid body, and consists in a repulsion, which is developed from the parts of the solid body by the simple fact of attenuation, and is highest when the attenuation is most complete. The force has a progressive development, and acts most powerfully, or at first, in the direction in which the dimensions of the attenuated mass decrease, and then {{in the direction of the}} angles or corners which from any cause may exist on the surface. This force not only causes spontaneous diffusion of gases and other substances over the surface, but is considered as very elementary in its nature, and competent to account for all the phenomena of capillarity, chemical affinity, attraction of aggregation, rarefaction, ebullition, volatilization, explosion, and other <b>thermometric</b> effects, as well as inflammation, detonation, &c. &c. It is considered as a form of heat to which the term native calorie is given, and is still further viewed as the principle of the two electricities and the two magnetisms.|$|E
60|$|Obviously {{it is this}} {{reduction}} of the sensible phenomena it represents, to relations of magnitude, which gives to any division of knowledge its especially scientific character. Originally men's knowledge of weights and forces {{was in the same}} condition as their knowledge of smells and tastes is now--a knowledge not extending beyond that given by the unaided sensations; and it remained so until weighing instruments and dynamometers were invented. Before there were hour-glasses and clepsydras, most phenomena could be estimated as to their durations and intervals, with no greater precision than degrees of hardness can be estimated by the fingers. Until a <b>thermometric</b> scale was contrived, men's judgments respecting relative amounts of heat stood on the same footing with their present judgments respecting relative amounts of sound. And as in these initial stages, with no aids to observation, only the roughest comparisons of cases could be made, and only the most marked differences perceived; it is obvious that only the most simple laws of dependence could be ascertained--only those laws which, being uncomplicated with others, and not disturbed in their manifestations, required no niceties of observation to disentangle them. Whence it appears not only that in proportion as knowledge becomes quantitative do its previsions become complete as well as certain, but that until its assumption of a quantitative character it is necessarily confined to the most elementary relations.|$|E
6000|$|... 141 I must, however, remark, {{that this}} example, {{which seems to}} militate [...] against the {{assertion}} we made of the comparative inapplicability of [...] the Method of Difference to cases of pure observation, is really one [...] of those exceptions which, according to a proverbial expression, [...] prove the general rule. For in this case, in which Nature, in her [...] experiment, seems to have imitated the type of the experiments made [...] by man, she has only succeeded in producing the likeness of man’s [...] most imperfect experiments; namely, those in which, though he [...] succeeds in producing the phenomenon, he does so by employing [...] complex means, which he is unable perfectly to analyze, and can [...] form, therefore, no sufficient judgment what portion of the effects [...] may be due, not to the supposed cause, but to some unknown agency of [...] {{the means by which}} that cause was produced. In the natural [...] experiment which we are speaking of, the means used was the clearing [...] off a canopy of clouds; and we certainly do not know sufficiently in [...] what this process consists, or on what it depends, to be certain a [...] priori that it might not operate upon the deposition of dew [...] independently of any <b>thermometric</b> effect at the earth’s surface. [...] Even, therefore, in a case so favorable as this to Nature’s [...] experimental talents, her experiment is of little value except in [...] corroboration of a conclusion already attained through other means.|$|E
60|$|It is {{probable}} that few persons who proclaim their belief in miracles have considered what {{would be necessary to}} justify that belief {{in the case of a}} professed modern miracle-worker. Suppose, for example, it is affirmed that A.B. died and that C.D. brought him to life again. Let it be granted that A.B. and C.D. are persons of unimpeachable honour and veracity; that C.D. is the next heir to A.B.'s estate, and therefore had a strong motive for not bringing him to life again; and that all A.B.'s relations, respectable persons who bore him a strong affection, or had otherwise an interest in his being alive, declared that they saw him die. Furthermore, let A.B. be seen after his recovery by all his friends and neighbours, and let his and their depositions, that he is now alive, be taken down before a magistrate of known integrity and acuteness: would all this constitute even presumptive evidence that C.D. had worked a miracle? Unquestionably not. For the most important link in the whole chain of evidence is wanting, and that is the proof that A.B. was really dead. The evidence of ordinary observers on such a point as this is absolutely worthless. And, even medical evidence, unless the physician is a person of unusual knowledge and skill, may have little more value. Unless careful <b>thermometric</b> observation proves that the temperature has sunk below a certain point; unless the cadaveric stiffening of the muscles has become well established; all the ordinary signs of death may be fallacious, and the intervention of C.D. may have had no more to do with A.B.'s restoration to life than any other fortuitously coincident event.|$|E
6000|$|... “Be not a baker if {{your head}} {{be made of}} butter,” says a homely proverb, which, being interpreted, may mean, let no woman rush into print who is not {{prepared}} for the consequences. We are aware that our remarks {{are in a very}} different tone from that of the reviewers who, with perennial recurrence of precisely similar emotions, only paralleled, we imagine, in the experience of monthly nurses, tell one lady novelist after another that they “hail” her productions “with delight.” We are aware that the ladies at whom our criticism is pointed are accustomed to be told, in the choicest phraseology of puffery, that their pictures of life are brilliant, their characters well drawn, their style fascinating, and their sentiments lofty. But if they are inclined to resent our plainness of speech, we ask them to reflect for a moment on the chary praise, and often captious blame, which their panegyrists give to writers whose works are on the way to become classics. No sooner does a woman show that she has genius or effective talent, than she receives the tribute of being moderately praised and severely criticised. By a peculiar <b>thermometric</b> adjustment, when a woman’s talent is at zero, journalistic approbation is at the boiling pitch; when she attains mediocrity, it is already at no more than summer heat; and if ever she reaches excellence, critical enthusiasm drops to the freezing point. Harriet Martineau, Currer Bell, and Mrs. Gaskell have been treated as cavalierly {{as if they had been}} men. And every critic who forms a high estimate of the share women may ultimately take in literature, will on principle abstain from any exceptional indulgence toward the productions of literary women. For it must be plain to every one who looks impartially and extensively into feminine literature that its greatest deficiencies are due hardly more to the want of intellectual power than to the want of those moral qualities that contribute to literary excellence—patient diligence, a sense of the responsibility involved in publication, and an appreciation of the sacredness of the writer’s art. In the majority of woman’s books you see that kind of facility which springs from the absence of any high standard; that fertility in imbecile combination or feeble imitation which a little self-criticism would check and reduce to barrenness; just as with a total want of musical ear people will sing out of tune, while a degree more melodic sensibility would suffice to render them silent. The foolish vanity of wishing to appear in print, instead of being counterbalanced by any consciousness of the intellectual or moral derogation implied in futile authorship, seems to be encouraged by the extremely false impression that to write at all is a proof of superiority in a woman. On this ground we believe that the average intellect of women is unfairly represented by the mass of feminine literature, and that while the few women who write well are very far above the ordinary intellectual level of their sex, the many women who write ill are very far below it. So that, after all, the severer critics are fulfilling a chivalrous duty in depriving the mere fact of feminine authorship of any false prestige which may give it a delusive attraction, and in recommending women of mediocre faculties—as at least a negative service they can render their sex—to abstain from writing.|$|E
