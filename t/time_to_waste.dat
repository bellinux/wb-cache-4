They had expected a land invasion but {{the size of the}} Arakanese naval force caught them by surprise. It was late April 1542.|$|E
25|$|Emma, Hook, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, Regina and Robin are in {{the library}} of the mansion, searching for a way to stop Gold and Isaac from {{enacting}} a new reality with the newly activated ink. They are joined by August, who shows them a drawing of the Sorcerer's Apprentice, who {{might be able to help}} them. Hook remembers the Apprentice from when he and Gold trapped him in the sorcerer's hat. With the help of the Blue Fairy, they release the Apprentice, who immediately says that there’s no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste.</b> He tells them that they must find the storybook page depicting the door, as well as the door's key, for only then will they be able to lock Isaac back into the book where he belongs. The group splits up, with Henry, Hook, David and Mary Margaret heading back to the loft for the book and key, while Emma, Regina and the Apprentice head to Gold's pawnshop.|$|E
500|$|Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone {{said that}} [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] {{features}} Lee [...] "sobbing hysterically over a grand piano". According to the IGN reviewer, Ed Thompson, the song [...] "takes the trademark Evanescence sound - Lee's celestial voice, and adds her brooding lyrics 'I can't change who I am, not this time, I won't lie {{to keep you}} near me and in this short life, there's no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> on giving up. My love wasn't enough'.". Danielle Baudhuin from The Oshkosh West Index noted that [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] was musically similar to [...] "Haunted" [...] from the band's debut studio album Fallen, noting how [...] "creepy background choir vocals and violins send listeners into a gothic Cathedral-like setting". Jim Farber from the Daily News said that [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] will remind older listeners of the 1970s art rock horror band Renaissance. Andree Farias from Christianity Today observed that the song had no connection with the movie Narnia whatsoever classifying it as [...] "just another bitter break-up anthem".|$|E

2500|$|Concurrent {{with the}} succès de scandale, both Buñuel and the film's leading lady, Lya Lys, {{received}} offers of interest from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and traveled to Hollywood at the studio's expense. While in the United States, Buñuel associated with other celebrity expatriates including Sergei Eisenstein, Josef Von Sternberg, Jacques Feyder, Charles Chaplin and Bertolt Brecht. [...] All that was required of Buñuel by his loose-ended contract with MGM {{was that he}} [...] "learn some good American technical skills", but, after being ushered off the first set he visited because the star, Greta Garbo, did not welcome intruders, he decided {{to stay at home}} most of the time and only show up to collect his paycheck. [...] His only enduring contribution to MGM came when he served as an extra in La Fruta Amarga, a Spanish-language remake of Min and Bill. [...] When, after a few months at the studio, he was asked to watch rushes of Lili Damita to gauge her Spanish accent, he refused and sent a message to studio boss Irving Thalberg stating that he was there as a Frenchman, not a Spaniard, and he [...] "didn't have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> listening to one of the whores". [...] He was back in Spain shortly thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|While most press {{coverage}} {{continued to be}} positive, with criticism only from leftist publications like The Nation and The New Republic, one attorney raised the first noteworthy protest. Francis Fisher Kane, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, resigned in protest. In his letter of resignation to the President and the Attorney General he wrote: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} the policy of raids against large numbers of individuals is generally unwise and very apt to result in injustice. People not really guilty are likely to be arrested and railroaded through their hearings....We appear to be attempting to repress a political party....By such methods we drive underground and make dangerous what was not dangerous before." [...] Palmer replied that he could not use individual arrests to treat an [...] "epidemic" [...] and asserted his own fidelity to constitutional principles. He added: [...] "The Government should encourage free political thinking and political action, but it certainly has the right for its own preservation to discourage and prevent the use of force and violence to accomplish that which ought to be accomplished, if at all, by parliamentary or political methods." [...] The Washington Post endorsed Palmer's claim for urgency over legal process: [...] "There is no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>waste</b> on hairsplitting over infringement of liberties." ...|$|E

60|$|As {{the winter}} deepens and darkens, {{the people who}} have <b>time</b> and money <b>to</b> <b>waste,</b> and who are always seeking {{opportunities}} for squandering both, find none so gracious and graceful as giving dinners to other people who have <b>time</b> and money <b>to</b> <b>waste.</b> The prime condition of such dinners is that neither host nor guest shall need them. The presence of a person who actually wanted meat and drink would imply certain insuperable disqualifications. The guest must have the habit of dining, with the accumulated indifference to dinners and the inveterate inability to deal peptically with them which result from the habit of them. Your true diner must be well on in middle life, for though the young may eat and drink together and apparently dine, it is of the gray head difficultly bowed over the successive courses, and the full form of third youth straining its silken calyx and bursting all too richly out above it, that the vision presents itself when one thinks of dinners and diners.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} is entitled “The Representation of a Child Worldview in Emma Donoghue’s Room”. It attempts {{to analyze the}} main character’s worldview which appears in the novel. Firstly, the writer finds out the plot of this novel {{and the second is}} to find out the main character’s worldview. The context {{of this paper is to}} represent the worldview of the main character in Emma Donoghue’s novel by using factual structure. The writer uses a descriptive qualitative method to answer the research question. The writer finds that the main character’s worldview is representing his mother’s view. Moreover, during the last 5 years, he spent the time in the room with his mother. Through Jack, Emma Donoghue told us an expansive eye on the world in which we live. The world is the outer space which has many same things, anything will hurt, and people who live in the world have no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>wasting</b> their <b>time</b> because it runs so fast. The worldview of the main character is found in resolution and denouement part of Freytag’s pyramid. The conclusion of this {{research is}} someone’s worldview cannot be separated from experiences; the set of beliefs about fundamental aspects of reality that ground and influence all the perceiving, thinking, knowing, and doing.
