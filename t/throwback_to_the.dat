5|$|Writer and series creator Chris Carter {{decided that}} {{rather than trying to}} present a typical Bigfoot-like creature, he would present the Jersey Devil as a missing link. Carter was {{inspired}} to write the episode by an essay by E. O. Wilson regarding ants and a story he wrote that posed whether mankind was hellbent on its own extinction. The concept of mankind being carnivores and eating its own tail evolved into the idea of using an evolutionary mutation that was a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Neanderthal. A Greg Cannom werewolf outfit from a previous project was used for the costume of the creature.|$|E
5|$|Forgoing the {{downloadable}} content {{model used}} in previous Guitar Hero games, Guitar Hero Live adds songs {{to the game}} via Guitar Hero TV (GHTV), an online game mode offered free of charge in Guitar Hero Live. Instead of playing the immersive first-person view that the main career mode presents, songs on GHTV are played over the music video or footage of the band playing at a concert. Songs on GHTV are normally offered in a curated rotation, similar to a music video channel, allowing the player to drop in and out, but the player can use collected in-game rewards or use microtransactions to play any available song outside of this rotation. FreeStyleGames found that this approach, {{in contrast to the}} traditional downloadable content model, made it easier to secure licensing rights with artists to use their songs, as well as a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heyday of music video channels like MTV.|$|E
5|$|Rommel was {{an ambitious}} {{man who took}} {{advantage}} of his proximity to Hitler and willingly accepted the propaganda campaigns designed for him by Goebbels. He sought {{to level the playing}} field for non-nobles, and also supported militarism and a strong German Empire, while treating people only according to their merits. He did not display hatred to people of noble descent, and in fact was a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> medieval knight in his personal traits, appearing well-versed in the ancient customs of chivalry, which helped to attract admiration from the British who saw in him a romantic archetype. Rommel classed himself as a traditionalist regarding military ethics and a modernist regarding warfare techniques. Certain authors remark that he also sought military glory and personal recognition, most of all from Hitler on whom, according to Watson, Rommel projected his idea of the German people's will.|$|E

Empires: Dawn of the Modern World was much more condensed, with only 1,000 years and only nine civilizations. Even so, the game received positive acclaim as a good RTS, but not very innovative.|$|R

25|$|The given name(s) {{normally}} {{comes before}} the surname. However, in {{a list of}} people sorted alphabetically by surname, the surname usually comes first. Hence some people may also use this order in spoken language (e.g. introducing themselves as Kowalski Jan instead of Jan Kowalski), but this is generally considered incorrect or a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Communist era when this order was sometimes heard in official situations. In many formal situations, the given name is omitted altogether.|$|E

2500|$|Keys {{released}} [...] "Doesn't Mean Anything" [...] as {{the lead}} single from the album on September 22, 2009. Critics gave the song good reviews, comparing it to previous singles [...] "No One", [...] "Superwoman" [...] and [...] "If I Ain't Got You". The single had mixed success; in Europe it did well reaching top five in Switzerland and top 10 in the UK. It peaked at number 14 on the US R/Hip-Hop Songs chart but only managed to reach number 60 on the Billboard Hot 100. On November 17, 2009 Keys released her second single, [...] "Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart".

The single was more successful than the previous, reaching number two in Norway and five in Denmark as well as number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the US R/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It was later released in the UK as the album's third single, where it {{would go on to}} peak at number seven.|$|R
25|$|In {{response}} to the punk fashion of the mid-late 1970s, there was a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> late 1950s Ivy League style. This revival came to be definitively summarized in an enormously popular paperback released in 1980: The Official Preppy Handbook. Popular preppy clothing for men included Oxford shirts, sweaters, turtlenecks, polo shirts with popped collars, khaki slacks, argyle socks, dress pants, Hush Puppies Oxford shoes, brogues, suspenders, seersucker or striped linen suits, corduroy, and cable knit sweaters that were often worn tied around the shoulders.|$|E
25|$|In some releases, {{the first}} disc of the DVD set {{opens with a}} CGI short created to promote the movie's tie-in video game, with Flux taking on the {{likeness}} of the Charlize Theron version.

In a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ongoing theme of the original shorts, the character is ultimately killed due to human error.|$|E
25|$|Macleod had {{intended}} {{at first to}} be a reforming Minister of Labour – he attempted, {{in the teeth of}} resistance from the TUC, to negotiate a Workers’ Charter (a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Industrial Charter of the late 1940s) in return for a Contract of Service. He also hoped to take a tougher line with strikes than his predecessor Walter Monckton, whose explicit remit had been to appease the unions.

500|$|Sequels, prequels and adaptations {{based on}} Austen's work range from {{attempts}} <b>to</b> enlarge on <b>the</b> stories in Austen's own style <b>to</b> <b>the</b> soft-core pornographic novel Virtues and Vices (1981) and fantasy novel Resolve and Resistance (1996). Beginning {{in the middle}} of the 19th century, Austen family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels. By 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations of Austen's works. According to Lynch, [...] "her works appear to have proven more hospitable to sequelisation than those of almost any other novelist". Relying on the categories laid out by Betty A. Schellenberg and Paul Budra, Lynch describes two different kinds of Austen sequels: those that continue the story and those that return to [...] "the world of Jane Austen". The texts that continue the story are [...] "generally regarded as dubious enterprises, as reviews attest" [...] and [...] "often feel like <b>throwbacks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gothic and sentimental novels that Austen loved to burlesque". Those that emphasise nostalgia are [...] "defined not only by retrograde longing but also by a kind of postmodern playfulness and predilection for insider joking", relying on <b>the</b> reader <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> web of Austenian allusions.|$|R

25|$|Traditionally, the soundboards of both {{northern}} and Italian virginals were pierced with a rose, sometimes {{two or three}} in early days. The rose had no acoustic function, and was purely decorative. Although these were a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rose in the medieval lute, they were never carved integrally {{as part of the}} soundboard. In Italian instruments they were usually constructed by combining multiple layers of pierced parchment, so that the final result looked like a gothic rose window, or an inverted wedding cake. In Flemish instruments, the rose was usually cast from lead and gilded, and usually incorporated the maker's initials.|$|E
25|$|The Coens {{directed}} the 2003 film Intolerable Cruelty, starring George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones, a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> romantic comedies of the 1940s.

She vows to get even with him while, at the same time, he becomes smitten with her. Intolerable Cruelty received generally positive reviews, although it {{is considered one of}} the duo's weaker films. Also that year, they executive produced and did an uncredited rewrite of the Christmas black comedy Bad Santa, which garnered positive reviews.|$|E

Seven News overtook the rival Nine bulletin in the ratings in 2007. This was subsequently followed {{by a series of}} advertisements and promos which have touted Seven News Melbourne as Melbourne's New #1 and Nine altering their promotions to simply say Melbourne's Best News - a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1980s when National Nine News Melbourne was being beaten in the ratings by ATV-10's Ten Eyewitness News.

50|$|As {{part of the}} franchise's 20th anniversary, the Colorado Rockies wore their {{original}} grey away uniforms at Coors Field on April 16 against the Mets. The uniforms, complete with the inaugural season patch, team name and purple piping, were the uniforms the Rockies used on their inaugural 1993 season. Though it was a home game, they wore <b>the</b> grey <b>throwbacks</b> <b>to</b> correspond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> franchise's first game at Shea Stadium. The Mets wore corresponding throwback white pinstripe uniforms with an underscore below the word 'Mets'.|$|R

25|$|Also in 1998, Dan Nastasi & John Milnes {{joined forces}} with former Mucky Pup and Dog Eat Dog bandmates Dave Neabore & Sean Kilkenny to become All Boro Kings. The project was a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early days of Dog Eat Dog as it focused on the {{hardcore}} style that Dog Eat Dog had originally displayed on their first two releases. The band quickly signed with Century Media Records who released their debut album Just For The Fun Of It in 2002. The album was released exclusively in Europe due to the strong European fan base the members had in their other bands. The band would also appear on several compilation albums. The band played most of their shows in and around New Jersey before embarking on one European tour with Biohazard, Agnostic Front, Hatebreed, Discipline, Death Threat and Born From Pain, {{as part of the}} Eastpak Resistance Tour. In 2004, All Boro Kings quietly disbanded.|$|E
25|$|On May 10, 2011, the Wizards {{unveiled}} a new color scheme, uniforms and logo. David Safren, Pat Sullivan, and Michael Glazer were the product designers {{for the new}} jerseys which include the Washington Monument as an alternate logo. The team of product designers was led by Jessie Caples, who made most of the design decisions. James Pinder was also {{an essential part of}} the team, as he helped to engineer the jerseys to meet the players' standards. The team reverted to its traditional red, white and blue colors, which are the colors of the American flag. The uniforms are based very closely on those worn from 1974 to 1987, during the team's glory years. Leonsis said the <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old Bullets' uniforms was intentional; the only difference between those uniforms and the current ones is the team name on the jerseys. The colors were also used by Leonsis' other franchises, the Capitals and the Mystics, who adopted to those colors in 2007 and 2011, respectively.|$|E
25|$|This updated and {{improved}} version was the Model B200, which entered production in 1981. It was fitted with PT6A-42 engines, still rated at , but with improvements {{that resulted in}} greater aircraft performance. Other changes included increased maximum pressurization (to 6.5 psi differential) and changes to the cockpit layout. The Model 200C {{gave way to the}} Model B200C the same year, with the first Model B200T and Model B200CT being modified from a B200 and B200C respectively, the following year. Commencing in 1984 the B200, B200C and their derivatives were fitted with a revised landing gear retraction mechanism, actuated by hydraulic rams powered by an electric pump installed in the LH wing. This replaced the earlier electro-mechanical retraction system of gearboxes, driveshafts and chains and sprockets that was a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Twin Bonanza. At the same time the propellers fitted were changed from 3-bladed Hartzells to 3-bladed McCauleys. Forty-seven B200Cs built that year were delivered to the U.S. military, with dozens more of a similar standard ordered in subsequent years, but not given official civil model designations.|$|E
500|$|On December 8, 2009, the Raptors {{introduced}} a blue-and-white <b>throwback</b> jersey <b>to</b> commemorate <b>the</b> Toronto Huskies, regarded {{by many as}} the unofficial, geographical predecessor of the Raptors. The uniforms were the same as those worn by the Huskies during the 1946–47 season, with the [...] exception of the nickname and length of the shorts. These uniforms were worn in six games in the 2009–10 season and have since been used as [...] "retro" [...] jerseys, worn during special [...] "Huskies Nights".|$|R
50|$|CINW {{ended the}} all-news format in September 2005, {{switching}} <b>to</b> news/talk programming. <b>The</b> {{first day of}} the revamped format was September 14, 2005, and, in a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> CIQC days, <b>the</b> first live guest, at 6:47 a.m. EDT with morning man Barry Morgan, was Stephen Pickford, who had hosted Travel World on CIQC from 1997 <b>to</b> 1999. <b>The</b> station's most popular broadcasters were Joe Cannon, Jim Duff and Charles Adler. One of the station's first announcers was Debbi Marsellos, a native Montrealer who was mainly a traffic reporter but also anchored the news and did some hosting. Debbi started working at 940 News from its inception, coming from CJAD. Patrick Letang was the 940 News Business Editor until he died on December 6, 2006.|$|R
40|$|During the 1980 s, French philosopher Gilles Deleuze wrote {{two books}} on cinema, Cinema 1 : The Movement-Image (1983), and Cinema 2 : The Time-Image(1985). For some {{scholars}} working in Anglo-American film studies, Deleuze’s works appear <b>to</b> be <b>throwbacks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> “bad old days” of the 1970 s and early 1980 s, when high theory dominated the fi eld. Deleuze’s at time dense and complicated texts are often {{criticized for being}} impenetrable, too focused on auteur cinema, and only applicable to European art films. By contrast, this chapter unpacks Deleuze’s film philosophy to demonstrate its usefulness for analyzing contemporary US cinema, both in its mainstream and alternative, independent forms. Firstly, the Hollywood rom-com Fifty First Dates (2004) is examined, to provide {{an understanding of the}} route into mainstream films offered by Deleuze’s philosophy. Fifty First Dates falls somewhere in between Deleuze’s categories of the movement-image and the time-image. When analysed in relation to these categories it provides valuable insights into both the development of the incredibly popular genre of the rom-com, and its ability to negotiate issues pertinent to contemporary US society. In {{the second half of the}} chapter, the very different idea of “minor cinema” is examined. The concept of minor cinema is typically used to discuss films from Africa, South America, or peripheral European countries. Here, however, it is applied <b>to</b> Gregg Araki’s <b>The</b> Doom Generation (1995) to illustrate how Deleuze’s philosophy offers a new approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> analysis of alternative US cinema. In both instances, the advantages of using Deleuze’s philosophy is that it retains the “engaged interventionist analysis” (Collins et al. 3) of film theory in the 1970 s and 1980 s, but is still applicable to these US movies of the 1990 s and 2000 s...|$|R
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{temperature}} control stainless steel fermentation tanks radically changed the wine industry in warm climate regions like Andalucia, La Mancha and the Levante, allowing winemakers to make fresher and fruitier styles of wine-particularly whites. While many producers focused on these crisp, fresh styles {{in the early}} 1990s there was a resurgence in more active use of barrel fermenting whites as a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> traditional, more oxidized styles of the 19th century. The use of oak {{has a long tradition}} in Spanish winemaking, dating back even centuries before the French introduced the small 59gallon (225liter) barrica style barrels. Gradually Spanish winemakers in the late 19th and early 20th century started to develop a preference for the cheaper, and more strongly flavored, American oak. Winemakers in regions like the Rioja found that the Tempranillo grape, in particular, responded well to new American oak. In the 1990s, more winemakers started to rediscover the use of French oak and some wineries will use a combination of both as a blend. Most DOs require some minimum period of barrel ageing which will be stipulated on the wine label by the designations-Crianza, Reserva and Gran Reserva depending on how long it spends in the barrel. The tradition of long barrel and bottle ageing has meant that most Spanish wines are ready to drink once they hit the market. A new generation of winemakers have started to produce more vino joven (young wines) that are released with very little ageing.|$|E
25|$|The game {{started with}} the Badgers kicking off to the Gamecocks. South Carolina would pickup three first downs but would punt after {{they go to the}} Wisconsin 36–yard line. The Badgers would then pickup two first downs on their first drive but stalled at the South Carolina 30–yard line. Wisconsin lined up in a punt {{formation}} and attempted a fake but Badgers punter Drew Meyer's pass was incomplete. The Gamecocks' next drive would result in a punt. On the Badgers next drive, QB Joel Stave was trying to throw away a pass into the ground as he was pressured but the pass deflected off a leg of his own lineman and into the hands of a South Carolina defender. On the very next play, South Carolina QB Connor Shaw threw a 39–yard touchdown pass to WR Bruce Ellington. The first quarter came to an end as the Badgers started their drive. Wisconsin would answer with a 1–yard touchdown pass to TE Sam Arneson from Joel Stave. South Carolina then drove 86 yards on 12 plays scoring on a reverse <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> quarterback. Wide receiver Bruce Ellington threw a 9–yard pass to quarterback Connoer Shaw. The extra point failed because of a low snap then caused the holder for South Carolina to try and run for the conversion but was tackled well short of the goal line. The Badgers answered again on their next drive with a 16 play, 75 yard drive that used up over six and a half minutes. The drive was capped by a 3–yard touchdown pass to WR Jeff Duckworth from Joel Stave. After the kickoff and a South Carolina kneel down, the Badgers led 14–13 at halftime.|$|E
500|$|Other {{writers were}} less enthusiastic. [...] Q {{magazine}} {{felt that the}} song was weak and that [...] "Bono falls back on his old habit of trying to be 'inspirational' by banging up the heat from simmer to meltdown between the verse and chorus." [...] U2 chroniclers Bill Graham and Caroline van Oosten de Boer also see the song as a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> group's earlier sound, but say that [...] "the band doesn't sufficiently develop the initial idea to warrant the five minutes of 'Ultra Violet'".|$|E

Many reviewers praised the game's graphics, sound, and varied yet refined RPG gameplay, with particular emphasis on the Battle Mode and Djinn system. Certain critics felt that, despite the technical limitations of its 32-bit cartridge, the game's graphical quality was still extremely high; GameSpot wrote that [...] "Golden Sun is a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> some of <b>the</b> SNES's best." [...] Complaints generally focused on a perceived overuse of text dialogue in the game's cutscenesparticularly during the prologue section.

In his review, he {{gave the}} third round of the 2008 TNA World X Cup Tournament a 9 out of 10, while the final round received an 8 out of 10. Kapur gave several comments regarding the third round bout: [...] "This was a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> some of <b>the</b> jaw-droppingly amazing X-Division matches that TNA used to deliver consistently back during their weekly PPV days.

It also contains much more repetition, metal riffs, overdubs, polyrhythms, and double bass drums than past Kayo Dot albums, while maintaining the band's typical wide-ranging jazz- and chamber music-influenced orchestration. It was picked as the 4th best album of 2013 on indie music website SputnikMusic.|$|R
