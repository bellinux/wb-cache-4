5|$|The {{diversity}} of monuments falling within the potbelly sculptural {{tradition and the}} individuality of the monuments support <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> monuments represent individual rulers.

5|$|Academic Andrew Price-Smith {{has made}} <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> virus helped {{tip the balance}} of power in the later days of the war towards the Allied cause. He {{provides}} data that the viral waves hit the Central Powers before they hit the Allied powers, and that both morbidity and mortality in Germany and Austria were considerably higher than in Britain and France.|$|E
5|$|Posner also {{rejected}} <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{defendants were}} removing {{the painting to}} save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which {{it might have been}} destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, {{and that there was no}} mob. In addition, the court found that because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1529, Cranmer stayed with {{relatives}} in Waltham Holy Cross to avoid an outbreak of the plague in Cambridge. Two of his Cambridge associates, Stephen Gardiner and Edward Foxe, joined him. The three discussed the annulment issue and Cranmer suggested putting aside the legal case in Rome in favour of a general canvassing of opinions from university theologians throughout Europe. Henry showed much interest in the idea when Gardiner and Foxe presented him this plan. It is not known whether the king or his new Lord Chancellor, Thomas More, explicitly approved the plan. Eventually it was implemented and Cranmer was requested to join the royal team in Rome to gather opinions from the universities. Edward Foxe coordinated the research effort and the team produced the Collectanea Satis Copiosa ("The Sufficiently Abundant Collections") and The Determinations, historical and theological support for <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> king exercised supreme jurisdiction within his realm.|$|E
5|$|When the {{election}} returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The {{closeness of the}} Florida outcome led to a recount. The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling, the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision that had ordered a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> use of different standards among Florida's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote {{by a margin of}} 537 votes out of six million cast. Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won {{the election}}, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official tally at 266). Bush {{was the first person to}} win an American presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} how {{the information}} state of an agent relates to <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> agent endorses.

25|$|From 1982 to 1987, Cheek {{was also}} {{involved}} in at least four civil cases challenging the Federal income tax. Among the arguments raised in those cases were: (1) the argument {{that he was not}} a taxpayer within the meaning of the law; (2) the argument that wages are not income; (3) <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sixteenth Amendment does not authorize an income tax on individuals; and (4) <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sixteenth Amendment is unenforceable. In all four cases, the courts stated that these arguments were erroneous. Cheek also attended two criminal trials of individuals charged with tax crimes.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sixteenth Amendment was not ratified, and {{variations}} of this argument, have been officially identified as legally frivolous {{federal income tax}} return positions for purposes of the $5,000 frivolous tax return penalty imposed under Internal Revenue Code section 6702(a).|$|E

25|$|The Court {{began by}} {{considering}} <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> questions are not justiciable (i.e. {{the court did}} not have the authority to answer) based on it being a political question.

Models of EC decision-taking suggest an increase because of the restaurant-bill problem and the tendency of committees towards universalism. The evidence is not enough, however, to be certain that a protectionist effect exists...|$|R
