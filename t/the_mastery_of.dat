5|$|Alexander Wynne, {{author of}} The Origin of Buddhist Meditation, observes that formless {{meditation}} and elemental meditation might have {{originated in the}} Upanishadic tradition. The earliest reference to meditation is in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, {{one of the oldest}} Upanishads. Chandogya Upanishad describes the five kinds of vital energies (prana). Concepts used later in many yoga traditions such as internal sound and veins (nadis) are also described in the Upanishad. Taittiriya Upanishad defines yoga as <b>the</b> <b>mastery</b> <b>of</b> body and senses.|$|E

New or modified vase shapes were frequently employed, including the Nolan amphora (see Typology of Greek Vase Shapes), lekythoi, as well as bowls of the askos and dinos types.
