5|$|The Tenth Amendment {{reinforces}} {{the principles of}} separation of powers and federalism by providing that powers not granted {{to the federal government}} by the Constitution, nor prohibited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> are reserved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> or the people. The amendment provides no new powers or rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> but rather preserves their authority in all matters not specifically granted to the federal government.|$|E

5|$|Because the Bill of Rights did not {{initially}} apply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> and federal criminal investigations were less {{common in the}} first century of the nation's history, there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century. The amendment was held to apply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> in Mapp v. Ohio (1961).|$|E

5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection {{of some of the}} Bill of Rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to state and local governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E
5|$|Black's most {{prominent}} ideological opponent on the Warren Court was John Marshall Harlan II, who replaced Justice Jackson in 1955.

5|$|By 1928, Tschaikovsky's claim had {{received}} interest and {{attention in the}} United States, where Gleb Botkin had published articles in support of her cause.

Botkin and Leeds arranged for Tschaikovsky to travel to the United States on board the liner Berengaria at Leeds's expense. On the journey from Seeon <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>States,</b> Tschaikovsky stopped at Paris, where she met Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia, the Tsar's cousin, who believed her to be Anastasia. For six months Tschaikovsky lived at the estate of the Leeds family in Oyster Bay, New York.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Bill of Rights was {{submitted}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> for ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties. Many Federalists, who had previously opposed a Bill of Rights, now supported the Bill {{as a means of}} silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention, which they desired. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.|$|E
5|$|During the {{six decades}} {{following}} the 1804 {{ratification of the}} Twelfth Amendment two proposals to amend the Constitution were adopted by Congress and sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> for ratification. Neither has been ratified {{by the number of}} states necessary {{to become part of the}} Constitution. Commonly known as the Titles of Nobility Amendment and the Corwin Amendment, both are referred to as Article Thirteen, as was the successful Thirteenth Amendment, in the joint resolution passed by Congress.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{ratification}} of the United States Constitution {{by the state of}} New York in 1788, the delegates agreed to keep New York City as the temporary federal capital.

5|$|He {{believed}} that the First Amendment erected a metaphorical wall of separation between church and state. During his career Black wrote several important opinions relating to church-state separation. He delivered {{the opinion of the}} court in Everson v. Board of Education (1947), which held that the establishment clause was applicable not only to the federal government, but also <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, {{during the}} 1960s, the Court under Chief Justice Warren took the process much further, making almost all {{guarantees}} of the Bill of Rights binding upon the states. Thus, although the Court failed to accept Black's theory of total incorporation, {{the end result}} of its jurisprudence is very close to what Black advocated. Today, the only parts of the first eight amendments that have not been extended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> are the Third and Seventh Amendments, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive bail, and the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted, that criminal juries be composed of 12 members and be unanimous in their verdicts.|$|E
5|$|In August 1936 the Middletons made {{a leisurely}} drive to New York City where they boarded a ship for the Philippines.

When they arrived in Hawaii, they were greeted by George Patton and his wife Bea. Patton was on duty in Honolulu and had sailed his own boat from San Diego to Hawaii, and later sailed it back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> {{at the end of}} his tour.|$|E

5|$|In September 1786, at the Annapolis Convention, {{delegates from}} five states {{called for a}} Constitutional Convention {{in order to discuss}} {{possible}} improvements to the Articles of Confederation.

Rhode Island, fearing that the Convention would work to its disadvantage, boycotted the Convention and, when the Constitution was put <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> initially refused to ratify it.|$|E
5|$|In a 5-4 decision, the Court {{overturned}} the silver platter doctrine and Elkins' conviction. Associate Justice Potter Stewart wrote the majority opinion, while Associate Justices Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II dissented. By giving {{a rationale for}} a broader interpretation of Fourth Amendment rights, the decision prepared the way for Mapp v. Ohio (1961), which applied the exclusionary rule <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to desegregating public schools, Nixon implemented the Philadelphia Plan in 1970—the first significant federal affirmative action program.

Nixon had campaigned as an ERA supporter in 1968, though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the ERA or their cause after his election. Nevertheless, he appointed more women to administration positions than Lyndon Johnson had.|$|E
