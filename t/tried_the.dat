5|$|By {{the reign}} of Henry VII of England, there were two methods of trial by peers of the realm: trial in the House of Lords (or, in proper terms, by the High Court of Parliament) and trial in the Court of the Lord High Steward. The House of Lords <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> case if Parliament was in session; otherwise, trial was by the Lord High Steward's Court.|$|E
5|$|During 1166, Neville was {{in charge}} of Staffordshire for the general eyre {{undertaken}} in that year, and also <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> pleas of the forest for Devonshire and Worcestershire, and perhaps elsewhere. The abbot of Battle Abbey in 1167 sent a monk to plead with Waleran of Meulan to intervene and stop Neville's exactions on the abbot's manors. After the Revolt of 1173–74, Neville {{was in charge}} of a forest eyre held from 1176 to 1178 which resulted in fines totaling 12,000 pounds from breaches of the forest law during the revolt. It appears that the king intended this eyre to be a punishment, and used the forest law because it was solely dependent on the king's will rather than being based in customary law.|$|E
5|$|Gradually, the Khalids were pardoned {{and allowed}} back to Bahrain after {{the leaders of}} the Shia {{community}} in Sitra were persuaded that the Khalids would not attack their villages again. Ibrahim bin Khalid, the eldest of the Khalids, who was exiled to Zubara (Qatar) for 10 years, was convicted in 1929 of being responsible for a failed assassination attempt on the ruler, his first cousin, in 1926. Instead of getting <b>tried,</b> <b>the</b> ruler appointed Ibrahim at his Sakhir Palace. His brother Salman, originally exiled for 10 years, was allowed back in 1928, while Abdulla was probably not exiled as he was an infant when the 1923 and 1924 incidents occurred.|$|E

5|$|Sarah, a strong-willed {{woman who}} liked to get her own way, <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> Queen's {{patience}} whenever she disagreed with her on political, court or church appointments. After her final break with Anne in 1711, Sarah {{and her husband were}} dismissed from the court, but she had her revenge under the Hanoverians following Anne's death. She had famous subsequent disagreements with many important people, including her daughter the second Duchess of Marlborough; the architect of Blenheim Palace, John Vanbrugh; prime minister Robert Walpole; King George II; and his wife, Queen Caroline. The money she inherited from the Marlborough trust left her one of the richest women in Europe. She died in 1744 at the age of eighty-four.|$|E
5|$|The {{locations}} {{on the standard}} British version of the board game Monopoly are set in London and were selected in 1935 by Victor Watson, managing director of John Waddington Limited.

He took his secretary Marjory Phillips on a day-trip from the head offices in Leeds to London and the pair looked for suitable locations to use.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} also of {{historical}} importance {{because of the}} Welsh tactics employed. In the 1886 Home Nations Championship Wales had trialled the four three-quarter system, wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine, and instead employ an extra centre three-quarter. The system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star Welsh player Arthur Gould, whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team Newport to retain the additional forward. With Gould working in the West Indies, Wales again <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> four three-quarter system against the Natives, and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system. Within six years the other three Home Countries had adopted four three-quarter style of play.|$|E

5|$|While Roberts had {{a natural}} talent for riding {{motorcycles}} on dirt surfaces, on paved road circuits, the motorcycle felt unsettled beneath him while negotiating a turn. During a race at the Ontario Motor Speedway, he observed Finnish rider Jarno Saarinen using a riding style where {{he shifted his}} body weight towards {{the inside of a}} turn. Roberts <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> technique and found that it helped settle the motorcycle. He adopted the cornering style and exaggerated the body shift {{to a greater extent than}} Saarinen had by extending his knee out until it skimmed the track surface. With his new riding technique, Roberts began to excel in road race events. Yamaha motorcycles performed very well in road racing, where the Yamaha TZ750 was the dominant motorcycle of the era.|$|E

5|$|With the Winter Olympics {{being held}} in Canada, the writers wanted an Olympic-themed episode that could air during the Games. The script was written by Rob LaZebnik, who {{considered}} having the plot revolve around Homer competing in four-man bobsled. However, he decided a curling episode would allow for the plot to revolve around Homer and Marge. In {{order to try to}} make the depiction of curling in the episode accurate, the writers visited a curling club and <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> sport themselves. They also consulted with a number of curlers. The episode was directed by Chuck Sheetz, while sportscaster Bob Costas guest-starred in the episode.|$|E

5|$|Nurmi {{struggled}} to maintain motivation for running, heightened by his rheumatism and Achilles tendon problems. He {{quit his job}} as a machinery draughtsman in 1926 and began studying business intensively. As Nurmi started a new career as a share dealer, his financial advisors included Risto Ryti, director of the Bank of Finland. In 1926, Nurmi broke Wide's world record for the 3000 m in Berlin and then improved the record in Stockholm, despite Nils Eklöf repeatedly trying to slow his pace down in an effort to aid Wide. Nurmi was furious at the Swedes and vowed never to race Eklöf again. In October 1926, he lost a 1500 m race along with his world record to Germany's Otto Peltzer. This marked the first time in over five years and 133 races that Nurmi had been defeated at a distance over 1000 m. In 1927, Finnish officials barred him from international competition for refusing to run against Eklöf at the Finland-Sweden international, cancelling the Peltzer rematch scheduled for Vienna. Nurmi ended his season and threatened, until late November, to withdraw from the 1928 Summer Olympics. At the 1928 Olympic trials, Nurmi was left third in the 1500 m by eventual gold and bronze medalists Harri Larva and Eino Purje, and he decided to concentrate on the longer distances. He added steeplechase to his program, although he had only <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> event twice before, the latest being a two-mile steeplechase victory at the 1922 British Championships.|$|E
5|$|Writing for the Star Tribune, Alexis McKinnis {{recommended}} the device {{for a woman}} having difficulty achieving orgasm. She wrote that for thirty-years a multitude of females had {{found it to be}} an assured way to reach orgasm. McKinnis {{recommended the}} Magic Wand again in a subsequent column as a Valentine's Day gift, and wrote that it faced little competition due to its basic construction, efficiency, intensity, and reliability. Author Robert J. Rubel wrote that the device was among the highest-demanded vibrators in the United States. Rubel stated that approximately ninety-percent of females are able to achieve orgasm with the Magic Wand. A panel of users arranged by Good Housekeeping <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> Magic Wand for relief of lumbar discomfort and were unimpressed with the results. Self Magazine observed in 2010 that the device's appreciation had become a cultural phenomenon.|$|E
