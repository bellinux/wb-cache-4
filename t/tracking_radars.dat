5|$|When {{the system}} was first being {{proposed}} {{it was not clear}} whether the phased-array systems could provide the accuracy needed to guide the missiles to a successful interception at very long ranges. Early concepts retained Zeus Missile <b>Tracking</b> <b>Radars</b> and Target <b>Tracking</b> <b>Radars</b> (MTRs and TTRs) for this purpose. In the end, the MAR proved more than capable of the required resolution, and these additional radars were dropped.|$|E
5|$|Eventually Kwajalein Island was selected, {{as it was}} 4,800miles from California, {{perfect for}} ICBMs, and already had a US Navy base with {{considerable}} housing stocks and an airstrip. The Zeus site, known as the Kwajalein Test Site, was officially established on 1 October 1960. As it grew in size, it {{eventually led to the}} entire island complex being handed over to the Army from the Navy on 1 July 1964. The site took up a considerable amount of the empty land to {{the north side of the}} airfield. The launchers were located on the far southwestern corner of the island, with the Target <b>Tracking</b> <b>Radars,</b> Missile <b>Tracking</b> <b>Radars</b> (MTRs) and various control sites and generators running along the northern side of the airfield. The ZAR transmitter and receiver were some distance away, off the northeastern edge of the airfield.|$|E
5|$|The {{interceptor}} {{would lose}} maneuverability as it {{climbed out of}} the atmosphere and its aerodynamic surfaces became less effective, so {{it would have to be}} directed onto the target as rapidly as possible, leaving only minor fine tuning later in the engagement. This required that accurate tracks be developed for both the warhead and outgoing missile very quickly in comparison to a system like Nike B where the guidance could be updated throughout the engagement. This demanded new computers and <b>tracking</b> <b>radars</b> with much higher processing rates than the systems used on earlier Nikes. Bell suggested that their transistor offered the solution to the data processing problem.|$|E

50|$|The FPS-80 was a <b>tracking</b> <b>radar</b> and the FPS-17 was a {{detection}} radar for Soviet missiles. Both {{were part}} of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS). The large detection radar (AN/FPS-17) went into operation in 1960. In 1961, the AN/FPS-80 <b>tracking</b> <b>radar</b> was constructed nearby. These radars were closed in the 1970s.|$|R
25|$|The {{success of}} the FPS-17 {{technology}} led directly {{to the development of}} the larger and more powerful Ballistic Missile Warning System (BMEWS). BMEWS detection and <b>tracking</b> <b>radars</b> were prototyped on Trinidad Island and the operational installations were made at Thule, Greenland; Clear, Alaska; and Fylingdales Moor, UK.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 {{a version}} of A-35 was tested with the main command centre, one radar and three battle stations. The command centre was located at the same site as the Dunay-3 radar. In 1974 a version was tested with the main command with its 5E92 {{computer}} and four of the eight battle stations. Each battle station had two <b>tracking</b> <b>radars,</b> two battle management radars and sixteen A-350 missiles.|$|E

Advanced Air Defence (AAD) missile positioned at Wheeler Island, about 70km across sea from Chandipur, received signals from <b>tracking</b> <b>radars</b> installed along the coastline and travelled through the sky at a speed of 4.5 Mach to destroy it.|$|E

25|$|The IFC {{contained}} {{the search and}} <b>tracking</b> <b>radars</b> and control center (operators, computer, etc.), and various related offices and communications centres for general operations. To operate the Nike-Hercules system on the IFC the crew consisted of about nine operators under command of the Battery Control Officer (BCO). The crew on the LA, also under command of the BCO, was responsible for preparing and erecting the missile. On both the IFC and the LA maintenance people were available.|$|E
25|$|Introduced {{in light}} of the {{ballistic}} missile threat from mainly Pakistan, it is a double-tiered system consisting of two land and sea-based interceptor missiles, namely the Prithvi Air Defence (PAD) missile for high altitude interception, and the Advanced Air Defence (AAD) Missile for lower altitude interception. The two-tiered shield should be able to intercept any incoming missile launched from 5,000 kilometres away. The system also includes an overlapping network of early warning and <b>tracking</b> <b>radars,</b> as well as command and control posts.|$|E
25|$|Even as the Nike was {{undergoing}} testing, planners grew {{concerned about the}} missile's ability to attack formations of aircraft. Given the low resolution of the <b>tracking</b> <b>radars</b> available at the time, a formation of aircraft would appear on the radars as a single larger return. Launched against such a formation, the Nike would fly towards {{the center of the}} composite return. Given the Nike warhead's relatively small lethal radius, if the missile flew {{into the middle of the}} formation and exploded, it would be highly unlikely to destroy any of the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Deployment of the INH upgrade kits {{began on}} 10 June 1961 at the BA-30 {{site in the}} Washington-Baltimore defense area, and {{continued}} into September 1967. HIPAR was a large system and generally deployed under a dome {{on top of a}} concrete platform that raised it above any local obstructions. To provide the same range of view, the <b>tracking</b> <b>radars</b> were also often placed on concrete platforms of their own, although these were much smaller. LOPAR was retained in order to allow the same displays {{to be used in the}} launcher control sitesadapting HIPAR to use the existing displays would require more work and reduce the effectiveness of that radar.|$|E
500|$|Additional {{tracking}} {{tests were}} carried out by Target <b>Tracking</b> <b>Radars</b> (TTRs) at Bell's Whippany, NJ labs and an installation on Ascension Island. The latter was first used {{in an attempt to}} track a SM-68 Titan on 29 March 1961, but the data download from Cape Canaveral simulating Zeus Acquisition Radar (ZAR) information failed. A second test on 28 May was successful. Later in the year the Ascension site tracked a series of four test launches, two Atlas, two Titan, generating tracking information for as long as 100 seconds. A ZAR at White Sands reached initial operation in June 1961, and was tested against balloons, aircraft, parachutes deployed from sounding rockets and Hercules missiles. A TTR was completed at White Sands in November, and testing with the complete system of ZAR, TTR and MTR ("all-up" [...] tests) began that month. On 14 December a Zeus passed within [...] of a Nike Hercules being used as a test target, a success that was repeated in March 1962. On 5 June 1963, President Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon Johnson visited White Sands to view missile launches, including a Zeus launch.|$|E

He also suggested that radars be established at some future time on the islands of Lubang, Samar, Palawan, Jolo, Basilan, Tablas, Panay, and Negros.|$|E
2500|$|... : 9M311 {{missiles}} were first exported to China in 2005, {{and at the}} 9th Zhuhai Airshow held in November 2012, a suspected Chinese derivative of 2K22 Tunguska designated as FK-1000 was revealed to public. The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASIC) developed FK-1000, differs from 2K22 Tunguska in that FK-1000 is mounted on an 8 x 8 truck, and the 30mm guns of Tunguska are replaced by 25mm autocannons. The radars of FK-1000 are arranged in the {{exactly the same way}} as in 2K22 Tunguska, but mechanically scanned surveillance and <b>tracking</b> <b>radars</b> of Tunguska are both replaced by a phased array radars in FK-1000. A total of 12 missiles are mounted on the sides of weapons station, with 6 on each side, in the form of 2 rows of 3 containers/launchers each. The missile of FK-1000 is designated as KS-1000, which is also surprisingly similar to 9M311, and this has led many in the west to claim that FK-1000 system is derived from 2K22 Tunguska, but with cheaper price tag than the latest Russian system: in comparison to the 15 million dollars of Pantsir-S1 (SA-22), FK-1000 system is priced at 5 million dollars.|$|E
