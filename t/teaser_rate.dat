2500|$|Option ARMs {{are often}} offered {{with a very}} low <b>teaser</b> <b>rate</b> (often as low as 1%) which {{translates}} into very low minimum payments {{for the first year}} of the ARM. During boom times, lenders often underwrite borrowers based on mortgage payments that are below the fully amortizing payment level. This enables borrowers to qualify for a much larger loan (i.e., take on more debt) than would otherwise be possible. When evaluating an Option ARM, prudent borrowers will not focus on the <b>teaser</b> <b>rate</b> or initial payment level, but will consider the characteristics of the index, the size of the [...] "mortgage margin" [...] that is added to the index value, and the other terms of the ARM. Specifically, they need to consider the possibilities that (1) long-term interest rates go up; (2) their home may not appreciate or may even lose value or even (3) that both risks may materialize.|$|E
2500|$|For the borrower, {{adjustable}} rate mortgages {{may be less}} expensive, but at {{the price}} of bearing higher risk. Many ARMs have [...] "teaser periods", which are relatively short initial fixed-rate periods (typically one month to one year) when the ARM bears an interest rate that is substantially below the [...] "fully indexed" [...] rate. The teaser period may induce some borrowers to view an ARM as more of a bargain than it really represents. A low <b>teaser</b> <b>rate</b> predisposes an ARM to sustain above-average payment increases.|$|E
2500|$|Interest charges {{vary widely}} from card issuer to card issuer. Often, there are [...] "teaser" [...] rates {{in effect for}} initial periods of time (as low as zero percent for, say, six months), whereas regular rates can {{be as high as}} 40 percent. In the U.S. there is no federal limit on the {{interest}} or late fees credit card issuers can charge; the interest rates are set by the states, with some states such as South Dakota, having no ceiling on interest rates and fees, inviting some banks to establish their credit card operations there. Other states, for example Delaware, have very weak usury laws. The <b>teaser</b> <b>rate</b> no longer applies if the customer does not pay their bills on time, and is replaced by a penalty interest rate (for example, 23.99%) that applies retroactively.|$|E

50|$|A <b>teaser</b> <b>rate</b> is a low, {{adjustable}} introductory {{interest rate}} advertised for a loan, credit card, or deposit account {{in order to}} attract potential customers to obtain the service. The teaser rates are normally {{too good to be true}} for the long term, and are far below the common realistic rate for the service. In a competitive market, many companies will compete with each other for the lower <b>teaser</b> <b>rate.</b> Typically, the <b>teaser</b> <b>rate</b> is 0%.|$|E
5000|$|A {{low rate}} that is fixed until the {{transferred}} balance is paid in full. This {{type of offer}} is usually guaranteed {{only as long as}} the account is current (see <b>Teaser</b> <b>rate).</b> Whilst this allows the borrower to save interest on their existing debts without the need to initiate further balance transfers once a <b>teaser</b> <b>rate</b> offer expires, the fixed offer rate is higher than the limited duration <b>teaser</b> <b>rate</b> offer. (Typically, it may be between one-half and two-thirds of a fixed rate, fixed term personal loan) ...|$|E
50|$|Some {{consumers}} with good credit manage {{to take advantage}} of teaser rates offered by the industry as a whole by applying for a card, having their balances transferred to that card, and then maintaining payments on that card during the period of the <b>teaser</b> <b>rate.</b> Prior to its expiration, they obtain another card that they use for the same. They continue this technique continually in an attempt to keep money borrowed at low interest rates. Many credit card issuers who catch onto a consumer using this technique will be reluctant to offer the <b>teaser</b> <b>rate</b> to such consumers.|$|E
5000|$|Because of looser loan {{restrictions}} {{many people}} who did not qualify for a mortgage before now could own a home.

Few councils had access to the complex option valuation models required, nor the market data needed as inputs for such models.|$|R
40|$|Adjustable-rate and hybrid loans {{have been}} a larger {{component}} of subprime mortgage lending in the mortgage market than prime lending. The typical adjustable-rate loan in subprime is a hybrid of fixed and adjustable characteristics in which the first 2 years are fixed and the remaining 28 years adjustable. Hybrid loans terminate at elevated probabilities even before the first adjustment date. Hybrid loan terminations are sensitive to interest <b>rates</b> and <b>teaser</b> <b>rates</b> (payment shocks). Default probabilities increase dramatically when payment shocks are mixed with low or no equity in the home. This is the mixture of events that helped to trigger the 2007 / 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. Copyright (c) 2010 American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association. ...|$|R

50|$|Because {{transferring}} to new credit cards {{often results in}} lowered rates, one can repeatedly make use of this process to save {{quite a lot of}} money over the years. The idea is to switch to a new credit card the moment the previous one's <b>teaser</b> <b>rate</b> has expired. There is a caveat: the credit card contract may include a clause preventing the credit card holder from transferring the balance a second time within a certain period of time. There may also be ways of extending the <b>teaser</b> <b>rate</b> or at least preventing it from disappearing prematurely. This method is often advocated by personal finance self-help sources.|$|E
50|$|An {{introductory}} rate (also {{known as}} a <b>teaser</b> <b>rate)</b> is an interest rate charged to a customer during {{the initial stages of}} a loan. The rate, which can be as low as 0%, is not permanent and after it expires a normal or higher than normal rate will apply.|$|E

This matches observed cellular phone service pricing plans in the United States and elsewhere. An alternative explanation with common priors can be ruled {{out in favor of}} overconfidence based on observed customer usage patterns for a major US cellular phone service provider. The model can be reinterpreted to explain the use of flat rates and late fees in rental markets, and <b>teaser</b> <b>rates</b> on loans. Nevertheless, firms may benefit from consumers losing their overconfidence. (JEL D 12, L 11, L 96) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper computes how coupon {{rates on}} {{hypothetical}} default-free 1 - 3 - and 5 -year adjustable rate mortgages with various caps and <b>teaser</b> <b>rates</b> issued during the 1970 - 76 period {{would have had}} to be set in order for the ARMs to have earned the market rate of return over a 7 1 / 2 -year holding period. The 1970 - 84 period includes both a relatively stable interest rate experience (1970 - 77) and a "worse case" sharply rising rate environment (1977 - 84). Thus the calculations include the entire gamut of margins that lenders might need to charge for various caps in order to earn the market rate of return. What margins lenders should be charging at any point in time depends on the relative likelihood of future interest rate paths, e. g., the 1970 - 77 pattern versus the 1977 - 84 pattern. More formally, the appropriate charge depends on the slope of the yield curve and the perceived volatility of interest rates. Copyright American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association. ...|$|R

5000|$|An {{order of}} {{payments}} for every credit card specifies which balance(s) {{will be paid}} first.

Any balance under a <b>teaser</b> <b>rate</b> or fixed rate will be paid off sooner than any purchases or cash advances, which usually have the highest [...] By avoiding making purchases or taking cash advances altogether, the borrower can ensure they maintain the full benefits of the original balance transfer.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} adjustable-rate loans, many negative-amortization loans have been advertised with either teaser or artificial, {{introductory}} interest rates {{or with the}} minimum loan payment expressed {{as a percentage of}} the loan amount. For example, a negative-amortization loan is often advertised as featuring [...] "1% interest", or by prominently displaying a 1% number without explaining the F.I.R. This practice has been done by large corporate lenders. This practice has been considered deceptive for two different reasons: most mortgages do not feature <b>teaser</b> <b>rates,</b> so consumers do not look out for them; and, many consumers aren't aware of the negative amortization side effect of only paying 1% of the loan amount per year. In addition, most negative amortization loans contain a clause saying that the payment may not increase more than 7.5% each year, except if the 5-year period is over or if the balance has grown by 15%. Critics say this clause is only there to deceive borrowers into thinking the payment could only jump a small amount, whereas in fact the other two conditions are more likely to occur.|$|R
50|$|Adjustable rate {{mortgages}} {{are dangerous}} because their interest rate could spike to {{five or ten}} percent, especially for sub-prime borrowers whose loans started with low <b>teaser</b> adjustable <b>rates</b> but compensate by charging several times the official interest rate later. The only exception to this net benefit rule is when someone refinances to a fixed rate mortgage from an adjustable rate mortgage. In that case, the new interest rate may actually be higher than the ARM interest rate.|$|R
5000|$|We {{also set}} {{conservative}} underwriting standards for loans we finance {{to ensure the}} homebuyers can afford their loans over the long term. We sought to bring the standards we apply to the prime space to the subprime market with our industry partners primarily to expand our services to underserved families.Unfortunately, Fannie Mae-quality, safe loans in the subprime market did not become the standard, and the lending market moved away from us. Borrowers were offered a range of loans that layered <b>teaser</b> <b>rates,</b> interest-only, negative amortization and payment options and low-documentation requirements on top of floating-rate loans. In early 2005 we began sounding our concerns about this [...] "layered-risk" [...] lending. For example, Tom Lund, the head of our single-family mortgage business, publicly stated, [...] "One {{of the things we}} don't feel good about right now as we look into this marketplace is more homebuyers being put into programs that have more risk. Those products are for more sophisticated buyers. Does it make sense for borrowers to take on risk they may not be aware of? Are we setting them up for failure? As a result, we gave up significant market share to our competitors." ...|$|R
50|$|This <b>teaser</b> <b>rate</b> is temporary. The {{duration}} of teaser rates vary from (typically) 6 to 15 months, {{after which the}} remaining transferred balance is subject to purchase rate. Teaser rates in the UK can often be longer than in North America, with (typically) 6 to 35 months available for UK balance transfers. Failure to ensure the account is current (payments made on time) may result in {{the withdrawal of the}} offer rate. Customers should pay attention to the length of time of the opening offer, since once it is over there is a sudden increase in rates. This increase is the credit card company's method of making extra profits {{to make up for the}} losses of charging the lower introductory rate. Of course, this can be countered by switching to yet another credit card company.|$|E

40|$|Excessive borrowing, no {{less than}} {{insufficient}} savings, might be a product of bounded rationality. Identifiable psychological mechanisms are likely to contribute to excessive borrowing; these include myopia, procrastination, optimism bias, 2 ̆ 2 miswanting, 2 ̆ 2 and {{what might be called}} cumulative cost neglect. Suppose that excessive borrowing is a significant problem for some or many; if so, how might the law respond? The first option involves weak paternalism, through debiasing and other strategies that leave people free to choose as they wish. Another option is strong paternalism, which forecloses choice. Because of private heterogeneity and the risk of government error, regulators should have a firm presumption against strong paternalism, and hence the initial line of defense against excessive borrowing consists of information campaigns, debiasing, and default rules. On imaginable empirical findings, however, there may be a plausible argument for strong paternalism in the form of restrictions on various practices, perhaps including 2 ̆ 2 <b>teaser</b> <b>rates</b> 2 ̆ 2 and late fees The two larger themes applicable in many contexts, involve the importance of an ex post perspective on the consequences of consumer choices and the virtues and limits of weak forms of paternalism, including debiasing and libertarian paternalism...|$|R
40|$|In most {{developing}} countries, {{housing finance}} and mortgage lending are undergoing changes driven by financial deregulation policies, which include interest rate decontrol and privatization. In this study, we analyze detailed residential mortgage data from housing finance institutions (HFIs) in Kenya, {{to determine the}} impact of deregulation on loan performance. Using a hazard model, we find that interest rates, real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), exchange rate, and deregulation are significant in explaining the hazard of mortgage delinquency. We use a before and after deregulation framework to analyze the influence of deregulation on the probability of mortgage delinquency, and find {{that the number of}} delinquent loans increased after deregulation, the duration of loans from time of loan origination to time of delinquency decreased, and that loan repayment was also faster after deregulation. The study concludes that deregulation increased both the probability of delinquency as well as the probability of loan prepayment in Kenya. Our interpretation of the results is that, borrowers reacted to increasing interest rates, trigger events, and availability of cheaper funds elsewhere, while lenders reacted to increased competition introduced by deregulation by adopting more flexible credit risk analysis as well as <b>teaser</b> <b>rates</b> to attract demand. Given the scarcity of literature relating to mortgage finance in sub-Sahara Africa, this study provides valuable insight into the current lending environment, feasibility of future lending, and includes suggestions for improvement...|$|R
40|$|Bait and switch” can {{describe}} {{a range of}} commercial behaviors common in the everyday marketplace, but virtually ignored in the academic literature. The traditional definition of unlawful bait and switch applies to insincere offers to sell one item in order to induce the buyer to purchase another. Certain sellers have historically employed bait-and-switch tactics, including urban retailers, aluminum siding companies, and supermarkets. Colloquially, this definition can also cover lawful or other borderline sales tactics, {{including the use of}} <b>teaser</b> <b>rates</b> or low introductory pricing, or even “free offers. ” Even common lawful tactics, like the deliberate routing of customers past other retail displays on their way to purchase high-volume or featured items, may involve “bait” to induce other purchases. Why are some of these behaviors lawful and others unlawful? In this Article, I examine several different flavors of bait-and-switch tactics, exploring the underlying behaviors behind the tactics and the welfare implications of regulating them. Looking to the literature on commercial custom and norms, I find a pattern showing that bait-and-switch practices that align with custom and norms tend to be lawful, and those that do not tend to be unlawful. Welfare advancement seemingly plays a distant secondary role in explaining bait-and-switch regulation. My finding should compel regulators to consider whether the goal of elevating the market atmosphere by banning offensive behavior should trump welfare concerns. Further, my conclusion can also help advocates shape more effective arguments for adjusting trade practice regulation...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses microlevel data {{to examine}} recent {{prepayment}} performance of adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) employing the competing risk methodology developed by Deng, Quigley and Van Order (2000). We find {{support for the}} <b>teaser</b> <b>rate</b> and adjustment date effects implied by the theoretical model of Kau "et al. " (1993). In addition, we find that teased ARMs bear prepayment risk related to their discount, contrary to results reported by VanderHoff (1996) and Green and Shilling (1997). Finally, and contrary to the usual finding for fixed-rate mortgages, we find that loan age has {{a negative effect on}} prepayment risk for ARMs, consistent with the phenomenon that borrowers with high mobility and/or propensity to refinance exit the pool early.

40|$|The {{effect of}} payment shocks on {{subprime}} hybrid ARM mortgage prepayment and delinquency is examined. Using loan level data from private label securities, we modeled {{the effects of}} payment shocks on mortgage performance. Our study provided interesting empirical results in three main areas: First, we addressed the effect of payment shocks on subsequent mortgage delinquency. Second, we studied how the effect of payment shocks varies and decays over time. Third, we disentangled the impact of payment shocks based on {{the reason for the}} shocks: payment shock due to the expiration of a <b>teaser</b> <b>rate</b> (i. e. "teaser shock") versus the payment shock due to index rate changes at the time of reset (i. e. "market rate shock"). We find that the effect of payment shock on loan performance varies by the delinquency status of the loan {{at the time of the}} shock. That is, the payment shock has the most significant effect on "current" loans rather than loans already in delinquency. Also of note, we find that the effect of a payment shock decays only gradually over time. We find that the impact of "teaser shocks" and "market rate shocks" on mortgage performance do not differ substantially, even though teaser shocks may be somewhat more predictable than market rate shocks. This suggests that either subprime ARM borrowers did not fully understand the product and the extent of the shock at the first reset date or that financially strapped borrowers used the product to speculate and were caught by the teaser shock when they were unable to refinance or sell (i. e. "flip") their properties. The study suggests that any modification plan designed to eliminate potential payment shocks or to otherwise lower payments will be most effective for loans that are currently performing rather than loans that are already in delinquency.

40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} {{a unique}} new data set on credit card accounts to analyze how {{people respond to}} changes in credit supply. The data consist of a panel of several hundred thousand individual credit card accounts followed monthly for 24 - 36 months, from several different card issuers, with associated credit bureau data. We estimate the dynamic effects {{of changes in the}} credit limit and in interest rates, and consider the ability of different models of consumption and saving to rationalize these effects. We find that increases in credit limits generate an immediate and significant rise in debt. This response is sharpest for people starting near their limit, providing evidence that liquidity constraints are binding. However, even people starting well below their limit significantly respond. We show this result is consistent with conventional models of precautionary savings. Nonetheless there are other results that conventional models cannot easily explain, such as the fact that many credit card borrowers simultaneously hold other low yielding assets. Unlike most other studies, we also find strong effects from changes in account-specific interest rates. Debt is particularly sensitive to large declines in interest rates, which can explain the widespread use of <b>teaser</b> <b>rates.</b> The long-run elasticity of debt to the interest rate is about - 1. 3. Less than half of this elasticity represents balance-switching across cards, with most reflecting net changes in total borrowing. Overall, the results imply that the consumer plays a potentially important role in the transmission of monetary policy and other credit shocks. ...|$|R
