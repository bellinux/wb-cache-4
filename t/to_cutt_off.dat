500|$|As Britain's {{education}} system became more secularized {{in the second}} half of the nineteenth century, Sherwood's evangelical books were used mainly to teach the poor and in Sunday schools. Hence her missionary stories were the most influential of all her works. According <b>to</b> <b>Cutt,</b> [...] "these stories, which in themselves kept alive the missionary spirit and perpetuated that paternal attitude towards India that lasted into the , were widely imitated" [...] and [...] "an unfortunate assumption of racial superiority was fostered by the over-simplification of some of Mrs. Sherwood's successors." [...] These books influenced Charlotte Maria Tucker ("A.L.O.E.") and even perhaps Rudyard Kipling. In the United States, Sherwood's early works were very popular and were republished well into the 1840s; after that, a tradition of specifically American children's literature began to develop with authors such as Louisa May Alcott.|$|R

40|$|The {{chance of}} {{predicting}} a preterm delivery {{may be the}} keystone to preventing or at least best management of it. The aim of our study, was to test {{the possibility of using}} vaginal -HCG level measurement to predict the spontaneous preterm delivery. In this prospective study, 150 pregnant women referred for prenatal care to Asadabadi university hospital clinic were studied. At a gestational age of 20 - 28 weeks, a cotton tip swab was placed into the endocervix and posterior vaginal fornix and sent to laboratory for -HCG measurement. Data were entered into the computer and analyzed using SPSS 11 and medcalc 8 Statistical software packages. Mean age of participants was 26 years (Â± 25. 9). Mean gestational age at time of sampling was 25 weeks. The relative risk of developing a preterm delivery for those having a vaginal -HCG above 30 mIU mL- 1 was calculated to be 2. 61 (95 % CI: 1. 25 - 5. 5). The relative risk of developing a preterm delivery for vaginal -HCG level above 45 mIU mL- 1 was 4. 5 (95 % CI: 1. 98 - 10. 1). The test for a cutoff value of 45 was quite specific and half sensitive with a negative predictive value of 95. 4 %. A cervicovaginal -HCG test with a <b>cutt</b> <b>off</b> value of 45 mIU mL- 1 can predict the preterm delivery, but a combination screening of cervicovaginal -HCG test along with clinical risk factor scoring for preterm delivery is suggested to be used in clinical practice...|$|R
