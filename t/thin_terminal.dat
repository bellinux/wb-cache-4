40|$|Current PC- and web-based {{applications}} provide insufficient {{security for}} the information they access, because vulnerabilities anywhere in a large client software stack can compromise confidentiality and integrity. We propose a new architecture for secure applications, Cloud Terminal, in which the only software running on the end host is a lightweight secure <b>thin</b> <b>terminal,</b> and most application logic is in a remote cloud rendering engine. The secure <b>thin</b> <b>terminal</b> has a very small TCB (23 KLOC) and no dependence on the untrusted OS, {{so it can be}} easily checked and remotely attested to. The terminal is also general-purpose: it simply supplies a secure display and input path to remote software. The cloud rendering engine runs an off-the-shelf application in a restricted VM hosted by the provider, but resource sharing between VMs lets one server support hundreds of users. We implement a secure <b>thin</b> <b>terminal</b> that runs on standard PC hardware and provides a responsive interface to applications like banking, email, and document editing. We also show that our cloud rendering engine can provide secure online banking for 5 – 10 cents per user per month. ...|$|E

50|$|The classic Golgi stain uses {{potassium}} dichromate and silver nitrate to fill selectively {{with a silver}} chromate precipitate a few neural cells (neurons or glia, but in principle any cells can react similarly). This so-called silver chromate impregnation procedure stains entirely or partially the cell bodies and neurites of some neurons -dendrites, axon- in brown and black, allowing researchers to trace their paths up to their <b>thinnest</b> <b>terminal</b> branches in a slice of nervous tissue, thanks to the transparency consequent {{to the lack of}} staining in the majority of surrounding cells.

40|$|AbstractThe {{pyramidal}} neuron {{is the principal}} cell type in the mammalian forebrain, but its function remains poorly understood. Using a detailed compartmental model of a hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal cell, we recorded responses to complex stimuli consisting of dozens of high-frequency activated synapses distributed throughout the apical dendrites. We found the cell's firing rate could be predicted by a simple formula that maps the physical components of the cell onto those of an abstract two-layer “neural network. ” In the first layer, synaptic inputs drive independent sigmoidal subunits corresponding to the cell's several dozen long, <b>thin</b> <b>terminal</b> dendrites. The subunit outputs are then summed within the main trunk and cell body prior to final thresholding. We conclude that insofar as the neural code is mediated by average firing rate, a two-layer neural network may provide a useful abstraction for the computing function of the individual {{pyramidal neuron}}...|$|E
40|$|A new {{reconstruction}} of Lepidodendron mannebachense is proposed here based on collection of well-preserved compressions from middle Moscovian volcanoclastics of the Radnice Basin, Czech Republic. These specimens that represent remains of juvenile and matured individuals make progress {{in our current}} knowledge on ontogeny of this species and help us to improve its whole plant reconstruction. The juvenile stage was characterised by an unbranched columnar stem. The mature stage of L. mannebachense had an umbrella-like canopy produced by combination of more or less isotomous apical dichotomies of the stem and main branches with anisotomous pseudomonopodial branching. Dichotomous branching built {{the frame of the}} crown and continued until the limit for meristem division was reached. However, most of <b>thin</b> <b>terminal</b> shoots were anisotomous lateral branches growing from the main dichotomies. Some of them as well as terminal branches bore cones on their tips. Only a narrow zone of leaves was maintained at any stage of tree development. In the mature stage, leaves were retained only at apical parts of terminal shoots. L. mannebachense was a monocarpic type of plant with a determinate growth...|$|E
40|$|Two {{contrasting}} {{theories have}} been proposed to explain the mechanistic basis of short term memory. One theory posits that short term memory is represented by persistent neural activity supported by reverberating feedback networks. An alternate, more recent theory posits that short term memory can be supported by feedforward networks. While feedback driven memory can be implemented by well described mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, little is known of possible molecular and cellular mechanisms that can implement feedforward driven memory. Here we report such a mechanism in which the memory trace exists {{in the form of}} glutamate-bound but Mg 2 +-blocked NMDA receptors on the <b>thin</b> <b>terminal</b> dendrites of CA 1 pyramidal neurons. Because glutamate dissociates from subsets of NMDA receptors very slowly, excitatory synaptic transmission can leave a silent residual trace that outlasts the electrical activity by hundreds of milliseconds. Read-out of the memory trace is possible if a critical level of these bound-but-blocked receptors accumulates on a dendritic branch that will allow these quasi-stable receptors to sustain a regenerative depolarization when triggered by an independent gating signal. This process is referred to here as dendritic hold and read (DHR). Because the read-out of the input is not dependent on repetition of the input and information flows in a single-pass manner, DHR can potentially support a feedforward memory architecture...|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{studies of}} the axial undulatory {{swimming}} techniques used by secondarily aquatic vertebrates have been largely restricted to crocodilians. Numerous members of the suborder Lacertilia (lizards) are also known to swim using axial undulatory techniques, but how they do so has received minimal attention from the scientific community. We investigated the morphology and undulatory locomotor kinematics adopted by the Eastern Water Dragon (Intellagama lesueurii) through observation of natural swimming and filming of animals in a flume tank with a high speed camera. We found that morphological modifications associated with improved swimming ability and correlations between wave characteristics and swimming velocity are limited to the tail. The shape of dorsal spines and {{the reduction in the}} width of transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae result in a mediolaterally compressed tail instead of the typically rounded or dorsoventrally, compressed tail seen in other Australian agamids. Axial undulatory swimming in I. lesueurii was found to be conceptually similar to that of crocodilians, but the relatively long and <b>thin</b> <b>terminal</b> part of the tail produces a different shaped undulatory wave. Unlike crocodilians and fishes, I. lesueurii does not use frequency moderated velocity control. Instead, changes in velocity are solely controlled by the phase speed of the propagating wave. The combined effect of these traits is comparable efficiency and performance in the water relative to that of crocodilians and an improvement relative to terrestrial lizards...|$|E
40|$|Light- and electron-microscopic {{observations}} of Ciona and Lytechiniu spermatozoa show a <b>thin</b> <b>terminal</b> filament at the distal end. The terminal filament is 5 — 6 /im long and contains the two central microtubules and a variable number of A-tubule {{extensions of the}} peripheral doublet microtubules. The transition from the 9 + 2 region to the terminal filament is tapered more gradually in LyUckinus than in Ciona. Photographs of the movement of beating spermatozoa do not show any obvious discontinuity in curvature at the transition region. Bends are propagated smoothly {{off the end of}} the flagellum with no decrease in curvature. However, spermatozoa in which the terminal filament has been removed show a clear ' end effect'. This end effect involves a rapid unbending of bends that have reached the distal end of the flagellum. Computer simulations of flagellar models lacking a terminal filament show a similar end effect. Addition of a terminal filament {{to the end of the}} computer model can eliminate the end effect. Realistic bending behaviour of the model is obtained by using a terminal filament with a tapered elastic bending resistance in the basal portion of the terminal filament and a value of 0 - 03 x io* pN ran ' in the remainder of the terminal filament. This leads to estimates of o-oi x io ' pN nm* for the elastic bending resistance of an individual microtubule, and 0 - 2 x io 9 pN nm 1 for ihe elastic bending resistance of the 9 + 2 region of the flagellum. An improvement in propulsive effectiveness by addition of a terminal filament remains to be demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{biomimetic}} micro-patterning of {{polymeric materials}} on their interfacial properties were studied experimentally. Micropillars of PDMS and SU- 8 epoxy were fabricated through soft lithography and UV lithography techniques, respectively. PDMS pillars were topped by <b>thin</b> <b>terminal</b> {{films of the}} same material through dipping method with different thicknesses and viscosities. Adhesion and frictional properties of biomimetic microstructures were examined in two modes of contact, i. e. laid and conformal contact. In the first mode of contact, i. e. laid contact, the contact between adhesive and adherent is laid {{on top of the}} micro-protrusions or is in contact with side wall of micropillars. Adhesion properties of the smooth and patterned PDMS were characterized through micro-indentation test. Moreover, the friction properties of the smooth PDMS sample and PDMS micropillars with different aspect ratios were examined in unidirectional friction testing. JKR theory of continuum contact mechanics was utilized to interpret the obtained data. To study the effect of second mode of contact, peeling behaviour of a conformal contact between solidified liquid PDMS and SU- 8 micropillars was monitored. Kendall’s model of elastic peeling was used to interpret the peeling data. It was found that patterning of the materials would decrease the real area of contact and accordingly adhesion and friction to the mating surface. Termination of the micropillars with a thin layer of the same material result in increment of adhesion as reduction of the real contact area could be compensated and the compliance of the near surface increases. Elastic energy dissipation as a result of enhanced compliance and crack trapping and crack propagation instabilities are the main reasons behind increment of adhesion of thin film terminated structures. Viscoelasticity of the terminal thin film remarkably increased the adhesion as a result of coupling mentioned mechanisms and viscoelastic loss on the surface. Decline of the overall friction could be tailored through use of different aspect ratios. Higher aspect ratios pillars show higher friction comparing to lower aspect ratio pillars. 550 folds enhancement of adhesion was observed for peeling of the PDMS tape from rigid micropillars with aspect ratio ranging from 0 to 6. It is concluded that for the lower aspect ratio micropillars, the elastic energy dissipation is playing the key role in adhesion enhancement. This role shifts toward side-wall friction during separation by increase in aspect ratio. These all give in hand a versatile tool to control and fine tune the interfacial properties of materials, whether they are concerned with adhesion or friction...|$|E

40|$|The motor {{nervous system}} of adult ascidians {{consists}} of neurons forming the cerebral ganglion fromwhich axons run out {{directly to the}} effectors, i. e., muscular and ciliary cells. In this study, we analyzed {{the development of the}} motor fibers, correlating this with organ differentiation during asexual reproduction in Botryllus schlosseri. We used a staining method for acetylcholinesterase, whose reaction product is visible with both light and electron microscopy and which labels entire nerves, including their <b>thin</b> <b>terminals,</b> making them identifiable between tissues. While the cerebral ganglion is forming, the axons elongate and follow stereotypical pathways to reach the smooth muscle cells of the body, the striated muscle of the heart, and the ciliated cells of the branchial stigmata and the gut. A strict temporal relation links the development of the local neural network with its target organ, which is approached by nerves before the effector cells are fully differentiated. This process occurs for oral and cloacal siphons, branchial basket, gut, and heart. Axons grow through the extracellular matrix and arrive at their targets from different directions. In some cases, the blood sinuses constitute the favorite roads for growing axons, which seemto be guided by a mechanisminvolving contact guidance or stereotropism. The pattern of innervation undergoes dynamic rearrangements and a marked process of elimination of axons, when the last stages of blastogenesis occur. The final pattern of motor innervation seems to be regulated by axon withdrawal, rather than apoptosis of motor neurons...|$|R
