50|$|Free-living copepods have <b>translucent</b> <b>bodies</b> {{divided into}} a broad head, a thorax bearing {{swimming}} legs and a narrow, limbless abdomen. They {{have a major}} articulated joint between {{the front and rear}} portions where the body flexes ventrally. Male Dioithona oculata are 0.6 to 0.79 mm long, with females being slightly larger at 0.62 to 0.9 mm. A distinguishing feature for this species is the structure of the lens of the eye.|$|R
50|$|They are small, no {{more than}} 3.5 cm in length, with {{partially}} <b>translucent</b> <b>bodies.</b> They are found in fresh and brackish water from Thailand to the Philippines and Sulawesi. They are named for a muscular organ found under the chin of males. This organ, which may possess small testicles, is used together with the pelvic fins to grasp the female during mating. Unlike most other fish, priapum fishes exhibit internal fertilisation.|$|R
50|$|Flabellina pellucida has a <b>translucent</b> white <b>body</b> and opaque white pigment on {{the tips}} of the rhinophores, oral tentacles and cerata.|$|R
50|$|Flabellina dushia is a flabellinid with opaque white pigment {{covering}} {{most of the}} body. The <b>translucent</b> <b>body</b> {{is visible}} through areas at the bases of the tentacles and rhinophores, behind the eyes and bases of the cerata. The rhinophores and oral tentacles are translucent at the base and covered with opaque white pigment in the outer two thirds. Mature animals reach 15 mm in length or up to 20 mm.|$|E
50|$|Eigenmannia vicentespelaea is {{a species}} of weakly {{electric}} knifefish in the family Sternopygidae. Native to the São Domingos karst area in central Brazil, {{it is the only}} known knifefish to exclusively inhabit caves. Measuring up to 12 cm long, E. vicentespelaea can be distinguished from its relatives by its <b>translucent</b> <b>body</b> and reduced or absent eyes. As some individuals retain well-developed eyes, this fish may have colonized caves only recently in evolutionary time.|$|E
50|$|F. poenicia has a <b>translucent</b> <b>body</b> {{sometimes}} with a purplish tinge, and the jaw plates are visible within the head as two purple crescents. The cerata {{have a deep}} orange-red subapical band and the digestive gland is usually orange or yellow. The cnidosac is opaque white. The upper half of the rhinophores have papillae on the posterior side, though these can be absent in juveniles. It has a maximum length of 25mm.|$|E
50|$|Pearlfish are marine {{fish in the}} Carapidae {{family of}} ray-finned fishes. Pearlfishes inhabit the {{tropical}} waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans at depths to 2000 m, along oceanic shelves and slopes. They are slender, elongated fish with no scales, <b>translucent</b> <b>bodies,</b> and dorsal fin rays which are shorter than their anal fin rays. Adults of most species live symbiotically inside various invertebrate hosts, and some live parasitically inside sea cucumbers. The larvae are free living.|$|R
50|$|This flabellinid nudibranch has a <b>translucent</b> orange <b>body</b> and red {{digestive}} gland in the cerata. There {{are white}} {{spots on the}} outer parts of the cerata.|$|R
5000|$|These small- to {{medium-sized}} catfishes have opaque, transparent or <b>translucent</b> <b>bodies,</b> hence {{their common}} name Asian glass catfishes. Despite this name, only three described species have clearly transparent bodies: K. minor, K. piperatus and K. vitreolus. Most significant among {{these is the}} ghost catfish (K. vitreolus), which is the [...] "glass catfish" [...] most often seen in the aquarium fish trade. This species was initially confused with the larger glass catfish (K. bicirrhis; infrequent in aquarium trade) and subsequently with K. minor (essentially absent from aquarium trade). This matter was only fully resolved in 2013.|$|R
50|$|Flabellina trilineata is a flabellinid nudibranch with a <b>translucent</b> <b>body</b> {{and three}} {{longitudinal}} white {{lines on the}} back and sides. The line {{down the middle of the}} back passes between the rhinophores where it splits and continues to the tips of the oral tentacles. The rhinophores are perfoliate and coloured white at the base but orange in the outer third. The digestive gland is either red or orange in colour. Maximum length is about 35mm.|$|E
50|$|The {{body of the}} European smelt is {{typically}} 15 to 18 cm long, slender and slightly flattened on either side. Larger fish may reach 30 cm in length. Smelts have a slightly <b>translucent</b> <b>body.</b> The back and sides are grey-green to pink in colour, the flanks bright silver. The tailfin has a dark border. The smelt lives {{for up to six}} years. One characteristic is its intense smell, reminiscent of fresh cucumbers.|$|E
50|$|This flabellinid nudibranch has a <b>translucent</b> <b>body</b> {{with a line}} of opaque white pigment at {{the edge}} of the foot. The outer half of the rhinophores and oral tentacles are covered with white pigment. The rhinophores are tuberculate on their rear {{surfaces}}. The animal grows to 10 mm in length. A variant with lines of white pigment on the oral tentacles and rear surfaces of the rhinophores is known from northern New Zealand.|$|E

50|$|Aeolidiella sanguinea is an aeolidiid nudibranch with a <b>translucent</b> red <b>body</b> and cerata. The rhinophores {{and oral}} tentacles are tipped with white. The body attains a length between 30 mm and 45 mm.|$|R
50|$|Gymnodoris ceylonica has a <b>{{translucent}}</b> white <b>body</b> {{which is}} covered with many orange spots. It has translucent orange-lined white gills and orange rhinophores. The foot is translucent white and edged with an orange margin.|$|R
50|$|Pectinatella magnifica (the {{magnificent}} bryozoan) is {{a member}} of the Bryozoa phylum, in the order Plumatellida. It is a colony of organisms that bind together; these colonies can sometimes be 60 centimeters (2 feet) in diameter.These organisms can be found mostly in North America with some in Europe. They are often found attached to objects, but can be found free floating as well. They form a <b>translucent</b> <b>body</b> with many star-like blooms along the outside. The density of the organism is similar to that of gelatin, and is easily breakable into smaller chunks.|$|E
5000|$|Bone {{china is}} a type of soft-paste {{porcelain}} that is composed of bone ash, feldspathic material, and kaolin. It has been defined as ware with a <b>translucent</b> <b>body</b> containing a minimum of 30% of phosphate derived from animal bone and calculated calcium phosphate. Bone china is the strongest of the porcelain or china ceramics, having very high mechanical strength and chip resistance, and is known for its high levels of whiteness and translucency. Its high strength allows it to be produced in thinner cross-sections than other types of porcelain. [...] Like stoneware it is vitrified, but is translucent due to differing mineral properties.|$|E
50|$|Le Blé d'Or restaurant- Xinzhuang {{store is}} located in New Taipei City, Taiwan. Directly related {{to the theme of}} the restaurant, the main {{material}} developed (entrance walls, ceiling, chairs) is a bio composite of recycled PP injected with hop and wheat husks issued from wastes of beer brewing. In the entrance, the Polli-Ber Bricks wall system set the tone. The semi-opaque leveled surface, with its gold-brownish shade, creates a casual yet sophisticated atmosphere. As for hops chair, its <b>translucent</b> <b>body</b> finish adds an extra layer to the depth of the chair’s aesthetic scope. No glue is incorporated in this design, ensuring maximum recyclability after its life cycle.|$|E
5000|$|ChuChus (or Chus, in Twilight Princess) are creatures {{similar to}} Buzz Blobs {{that appear in}} Majora's Mask, Skyward Sword, The Wind Waker, Four Swords Adventures, The Minish Cap, Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, and Spirit Tracks. In Majora's Mask, they {{appeared}} as slug-like creatures with squat, <b>translucent</b> <b>bodies,</b> stalk-eyes, and a permanently smiling mouth, while in The Wind Waker, Four Swords Adventures, The Minish Cap, and Phantom Hourglass, their design was merged {{with that of the}} Buzz Blob, and they had upright, opaque bodies and vibrantly colored faces, giving them a goofy appearance. In The Minish Cap two [...] "giant" [...] ChuChus (Link fights them while shrunk) appear as bosses (A green one as the first boss of that game and a blue one as a mini-boss later on). In Twilight Princess, their design was again changed. They no longer have faces, instead possessing larger, <b>translucent,</b> slug-like <b>bodies,</b> and can combine to form larger Chus. They change again in Skyward Sword, looking a lot more like Gels than they previously did. Their behavior from Twilight Princess has mostly been carried over, however.|$|R
50|$|Tritoniopsis cincta has a <b>translucent</b> white <b>body</b> with {{a yellow}} line at the mantle edge. The gills are tipped with red. The tips of the rhinophores and larger {{processes}} on the oral veil are opaque white.|$|R
40|$|A {{novel and}} fast {{microwave}} route is described for {{the synthesis of}} yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) and for its sintering to <b>translucent</b> <b>bodies.</b> Precursor was made by microwave decomposition (20 min) of aluminum tri-sec-butoxide and yttrium nitrate dissolved in ethyl acetate. The precursor, conventionally calcined at 1000 °C (1 h), was sintered in microwave using SiC as secondary heater for just 35 min. Resulting translucent YAG has a microhardness (HV) of 18. 1 GPa and fracture toughness (KIC) of 4. 3 MPa m 1 / 2. A 0. 86 -mm-thick sintered pellet exhibits approximately 45 % transmission for 520 -nm radiation. The entire microwave process requires less than 3 h...|$|R
