50|$|While {{there would}} always be some cheap {{domestic}} emission reductions available in Europe, the cost of switching from coal to gas could be in the order of €40-50 per <b>tonne</b> <b>CO2</b> <b>equivalent.</b> Certified Emission Reductions from CDM projects were in 2006 traded on a forward basis for between €5 and €20 per <b>tonne</b> <b>CO2</b> <b>equivalent.</b> The price depends on the distribution of risk between seller and buyer. The seller could get a very good price if it agrees to bear the risk that the project's baseline and monitoring methodology is rejected; that the host country rejects the project; that the CDM Executive Board rejects the project; that the project for some reason produces fewer credits than planned; or that the buyer doesn't get CERs at the agreed time if the international transaction log (the technical infrastructure ensuring international transfer of carbon credits) is not in place by then. The seller can usually only take these risks if the counterparty is deemed very reliable, as rated by international rating agencies.|$|E

The kind of generation used for fast response is usually fossil fuel powered which produces emissions of between 0.48 and 1.3 <b>tonnes</b> of <b>CO2</b> <b>equivalent</b> for every megawatt hour (MWh) generated.

50|$|On {{the poor}} white sands in Western Australia tagasaste has {{increased}} the animal carrying capacity from 1 to 2 Dry Sheep Equivalents with annual pastures to 8 - 10 Dry Sheep Equivalents (~ 1 cow) per hectare with mature tagasaste. This is roughly a 10 fold increase in soil fertility based carrying capacity. The yield of edible dry matter (leaves and fine stems) in the West Midlands is mostly {{in the range of}} 3 - 5 tonnes per hectare. It also prevents the wind erosion and excessive ground water recharge that were major environmental problems before. Recently it has been found that tagasaste can sequester carbon at the rate of about 6 <b>tonnes</b> <b>CO2</b> <b>equivalent</b> per hectare per year. About half the CO2 being stored is as organic carbon in the soil and half is in the wood of the branches, trunk and roots.

Halifax Regional Municipality has converted its bus fleet to biodiesel, with a future demand of 7,500 m³ of B20 (20% biodiesel fuel mixture) to B50 - reducing biodiesel content in low temperatures to avoid gelling issues - and 3,000 m³ split between B20 and B100 for building heat.

50|$|The {{process of}} {{receiving}} credit for JI projects is somewhat complex. Emission reduction projects are awarded credits called Emission Reduction Units (ERUs), which represents an emission reduction equivalent to one <b>tonne</b> of <b>CO2</b> <b>equivalent.</b> The ERUs {{come from the}} host country's pool of assigned emissions credits, known as Assigned Amount Units, or AAUs. Each Annex I party has a predetermined amount of AAUs, calculated {{on the basis of}} its 1990 greenhouse gas emission levels. By requiring JI credits to come from a host country's pool of AAUs, the Kyoto Protocol ensures that the total amount of emissions credits among Annex I parties does not change for the duration of the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period.|$|R

The rate for electricity is 1164 DKK per tonne or 10 øre per kWh, equivalent to [...]013 Euros or [...]017 US dollars per kWh. The CO2 tax applies to all energy users, including the industrial sector. But the industrial companies can be taxed differently according to two principles: the process the energy is used for, and whether or not the company has entered into a voluntary agreement to apply energy efficiency measures. Danish policies like this provide incentives for companies to put in place more sustainable practices similar to a cap and trade program on carbon dioxide.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{concern over}} the Earth's climate with respect to global warming and green house gas (GHG) {{emissions}} {{has resulted in the}} undertaking of projects to both reduce carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions and sequester CO₂ from the atmosphere. Projects are established for the purposes of generating carbon offsets measured in <b>tonnes</b> of <b>CO₂</b> <b>equivalents</b> [...] mtCO₂e. Offsets are traded in various regulated and unregulated markets to fulfill emission reduction obligations and meet corporate social responsibility objectives. Forest carbon projects in the form of afforestation and reforestation (A/R) are recognized as a preferred and viable option for sequestering carbon and generating offsets. This study assesses the viability of undertaking such projects on private lands within the Prince George Timber Supply Area. A qualitative review of the criterion through which A/R projects are established, including additionality, permanence, leakage, co-benefits and standards, was conducted to determine the applicability of pursuing projects on private land. A quantitative analysis was performed to determine the financial feasibility of forest carbon projects. Using TIPSY (a tree growth simulation model) sites of various productivities (site index values of 24, 21, 18, and 12) were modeled to grow stands of trees for the purposes of maximizing volume of timber, lumber production, and subsequent offset generation. Using industry (Canadian Forest Products Ltd. - Canfor) and government (British Columbia Ministry of Forests and Range - BCMFR) costing information for forest stand establishment and maintenance, and four year average market pricing for offsets in the over-the-counter market, internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV) calculations were performed. Only three out of sixteen scenarios that were modeled indicated positive rates of return, and these returns were consistently low ranging from 0. 27 %- 0. 51 % over 57 - 110 years. Using discount rates of 5 % and 10 % none of the scenarios modeledThe original print copy of this thesis may be available here: [URL]...|$|R

50|$|In January 2008, Switzerland {{implemented}} a CO2 incentive tax on all hydrocarbon fuels, such as coal, {{oil and natural}} gas, unless they are used for energy. Gasoline and diesel fuels are not affected by the CO2 tax. The tax is collected by the Swiss Federal Customs Administration. It is an incentive tax because {{it is designed to}} promote the economic use of hydrocarbon fuels. The tax amounts to CHF 12 per <b>tonne</b> <b>CO2</b> (US $11.41 per <b>tonne</b> <b>CO2),</b> which is the equivalent of CHF 0.03 per litre of heating oil (US $0.108 per gallon) and CHF 0.025 per m3 of natural gas (US $0.024 per m3). This tax comes from Switzerland's 1999 Federal Law on the Reduction of CO2 (CO2 Law). Although Switzerland prefers to rely on voluntary actions and measures to achieve emissions reductions, the CO2 Law mandated the introduction of a CO2 tax if voluntary measures proved to be insufficient. In 2005 the federal government decided that additional measures were needed to achieve emissions reductions and meet Kyoto Protocol commitments of an 8% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. In 2007, the CO2 tax was approved by the Swiss Federal Council, coming into effect 2008.
