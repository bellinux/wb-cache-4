5|$|His {{primary focus}} was gay-themed writing, though {{he also wrote}} about the {{entertainment}} industry. Mostly satirical, his writing was filled with increasingly clear anger and disdain for the Republican neo-con agenda, especially after the AIDS pandemic began to take a large toll on <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community.</b> A very strong voice in gay literature, Baker had admirers and detractors for his gay radical stance, both in the mainstream literary {{community as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|Congressman Phillip Burton, Assemblyman Willie Brown, {{and other}} California {{politicians}} recognized the growing clout {{and organization of}} homosexuals in the city, and courted their votes by attending meetings {{of gay and lesbian}} organizations. Brown pushed for legalization of sex between consenting adults in 1969 but failed. SIR was also pursued by popular moderate Supervisor Dianne Feinstein in her bid to become mayor, opposing Alioto. Ex-policeman Richard Hongisto worked for 10 years to change the conservative views of the San Francisco Police Department, and also actively appealed to <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community,</b> which responded by raising significant funds for his campaign for sheriff. Though Feinstein was unsuccessful, Hongisto's win in 1971 showed the political clout of <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community's</b> {{response}} to AIDS is {{over seven years}} old. It has proved effective in significant areas and deficient in others.

50|$|Manalansan gives a {{detailed}} description of the topography of New York City in order to show the actual physical and cultural barriers that exists between the different boroughs and <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> that exist there. Outside of Manhattan, <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> are divided by cultural and racial barriers; the Latinx, Asian, and Black <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> do not overlap and are also physically distanced from each other. Space is inherently racialized. <b>The</b> racialized <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> and spaces in New York City only further alienate queer people of color and make them less valued and validated in gay culture.|$|R
50|$|Bourne Free was {{originally}} {{set up in}} 2004 when a far right organisation was due to come to Bournemouth and preach that homosexuality was wrong. Many prominent figures and active members of <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> in <b>the</b> area came together to organise an event in the Lower Gardens to protect <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> from <b>the</b> homophobes and keep them together {{for a day of}} celebration, rather than of hostility.|$|R
5|$|When Dan White {{was found}} guilty of {{involuntary}} manslaughter, his successful diminished capacity defense enraged <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community.</b> That the police and fire departments had raised money for his defense gave their anger a focus, turning it against the city government and especially the SFPD.|$|E
5|$|With the 1979 {{municipal}} elections occurring only {{months after the}} riot, prominent gay leaders feared a backlash at the polls. The elections continued without incident, and <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> fared better than expected, wielding unprecedented influence. Although the virtually unknown gay Mayoral candidate David Scott {{finished third in the}} election, his showing was strong enough to force Mayor Feinstein into a runoff election against conservative City Supervisor Quentin Kopp. Feinstein's promises to appoint more gay people to public office, and her heavy campaigning in the Castro, ensured that she won enough support from <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> to give her a full term as Mayor.|$|E
5|$|Authors Joyce Murdoch and Deb Pryce {{say another}} {{effect of the}} case was a {{softening}} of the Court's attitude towards <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community.</b> Jacobson was the first such person to come before the Court to receive even the slightest empathy from it, {{and even a few}} years earlier his case might have been doomed from the start on that basis alone.|$|E

This led to increased political power in <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community,</b> which culminated in the election of Mayor Dianne Feinstein to a full term {{the following}} November. In response to a campaign promise, Feinstein appointed a pro-gay Chief of Police, which increased recruitment of gay people in the police force and eased tensions.|$|E
5|$|On a civic level, {{the closure}} of gay bathhouses in San Francisco became a bitter {{political}} fight in <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community.</b> Activists {{put pressure on the}} San Francisco Public Health director to educate people about how AIDS is transmitted, and demanded he close bathhouses as a matter of public health.|$|E
5|$|Although {{societal}} {{awareness of}} AIDS had developed {{at a slower}} pace in Canada than in the United States, films regarding the disease had appeared nearly concurrently: both the first Canadian documentary and the first American feature-length film on the subject, Nik Sheehan's No Sad Songs and John Erman's An Early Frost respectively, were released in 1985. However, the majority of the early gay artists with AIDS had died by the time Hoolboom made Frank's Cock; as such, the film scholar Thomas Waugh considers Hoolboom a second-generation figurehead in AIDS activism and one of the earliest not coming from <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E
50|$|The black LGBT pride {{movement}} {{began as}} a result of <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> black minority <b>community</b> in the United States feeling marginalized and less a part of <b>the</b> whole <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> in participation, organization and administration. There was also the factor of socio-cultural differences that prevented the sub-community in full participation in <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> movement.|$|R

5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power.|$|E
5|$|Before Ryan White, AIDS was {{a disease}} stigmatized as an illness {{impacting}} <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community,</b> {{because it was}} first diagnosed among gay men. That perception shifted as Ryan and other prominent HIV-infected people such as Magic Johnson, Arthur Ashe and the Ray brothers appeared in the media to advocate for more AIDS research and public education to address the epidemic. The U.S. Congress passed a major piece of AIDS legislation, the Ryan White CARE Act, shortly after White's death. The Act has been reauthorized twice; Ryan White Programs are the largest provider of services for people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Newsom gained {{national}} attention when he directed the San Francisco cityâ€“county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, {{in violation of}} the then-current state law. In August 2004, the Supreme Court of California annulled the marriages that Newsom had authorized, as they conflicted with state law at that time. Still, Newsom's unexpected move brought {{national attention}} to the issues of gay marriage, solidifying political support for Newsom in San Francisco and in <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E
50|$|Diagnosed with AIDS in 1991, Minneapolis cellist Kevin Ford began {{thinking}} about leaving a legacy to <b>the</b> Twin Cities <b>gay</b> <b>community.</b> Enlisting <b>the</b> help {{of two other}} local musicians, Tim Perry and Corwyn Knutson from the St. Paul Civic Symphony, Ford began placing calls to members of <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> in other major U.S. cities, inquiring on if and how they might have started their local gay orchestra.

50|$|Prior to {{becoming}} Police Chief Boothby was the unit commander or superintendent of 52 Division, the division that covered {{much of the}} downtown business and residential area from Spadina to Jarvis, the Lake to south of Summerhill. <b>The</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community's</b> village of Church and Wellesley was within the Division's boundaries. He was instrumental in beginning a dialogue between <b>the</b> lesbian and <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> and <b>the</b> police force; a force that had a violent history in dealing with <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> and lesbian <b>community</b> especially after the bathhouse raids of 5 February 1981.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} works of German {{film-maker}} Rosa von Praunheim during the AIDS crisis. In the 1980 ies and 1990 ies he produced several films portraying <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>communities</b> in Germany and the USA {{in the face of}} AIDS. First, this paper analyses the cinematic techniques von Praunheim uses to criticise <b>the</b> German <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> and present <b>the</b> American practices of performing community as a role model for AIDS-activism. In a second step, the focus is put on von Praunheimâ€™s autobiography and the rhetoric strategies he uses to participate in New Yorkâ€™s HIV-community, while being HIV-negative himself...|$|R
5|$|News of Chatwin's AIDS {{diagnosis}} first {{surfaced in}} September 1988. However, {{at the time}} of his death, obituaries referred to Chatwin's statements about a rare fungal infection. Following his death, members of <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> criticised Chatwin for lacking the courage to reveal the true nature of his illness, which some people think would have raised public awareness of AIDS, as he was one of the first high-profile individuals in Great Britain known to have contracted HIV.|$|E
5|$|Shilts {{praised the}} Public Health Department of San Francisco's {{handling}} of the new communicable disease as they tracked down people who were sick and linked them to other people who had symptoms, although {{some of them were}} living {{in different parts of the}} country. He criticized the New York City Public Health Department for doing very little, specifically when Public Health Director David Sencer refused to call AIDS an emergency and stated that the Public Health Department need not do anything because <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> was handling it sufficiently.|$|E
5|$|The Stonewall riots were {{a series}} of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> against a police raid {{that took place in}} the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village {{neighborhood}} of Lower Manhattan.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> of San Francisco had {{a longstanding}} {{conflict}} with the San Francisco Police Department. White's status as a former police officer intensified the community's anger at the SFPD. Initial demonstrations took place as a peaceful march through the Castro district of San Francisco. After the crowd arrived at the San Francisco City Hall, violence began. The events caused {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars' worth of property damage to City Hall and the surrounding area, as well as injuries to police officers and rioters.|$|E
5|$|Frances Milstead {{subsequently}} cowrote her {{own book}} about Divine, entitled My Son Divine, with Kevin Heffernan and Steve Yeager, {{which was published}} by Alyson Books in 2001. His mother's continued relationship with <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> was later documented in a film Frances: A Mother Divine (2010), directed by Tim Dunn and Michael O'Quinn. Postcards From Divine, a book composed of over 50 postcards Divine sent to his parents while traveling the world between 1977 and 1987, was released by the Divine estate on November 5, 2011. Postcards From Divine also includes quotes and stories from his friends and colleagues, including Waters, Mink Stole, Mary Vivian Pearce, Channing Wilroy, Susan Lowe, Jean Hill, Tab Hunter, Lainie Kazan, Alan J.

5|$|Gay men {{and lesbians}} came {{together}} to work in grassroots political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated. Reaction {{to the influence of}} Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>community</b> was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.|$|E
