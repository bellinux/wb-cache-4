5|$|A Master Plan {{adopted in}} 2000 called for <b>the</b> <b>port</b> to be {{transformed}} into a container port, which led to the purchase of the largest harbor crane in the state. In 2002, <b>the</b> <b>Port</b> District Commission took the lead in the development of Albany's Riverfront Park in the Corning Preserve as part of a development to enhance Albany's access to the river. <b>The</b> <b>port</b> helped in financing the project and in the construction of two bulkheads which have seasonal floating docks attached. In a 2005 audit, the Office of the State Comptroller questioned the port's involvement in the construction and financing. Two issues raised were <b>the</b> <b>port</b> district's lack of authority to build docks for non-commercial use and that <b>the</b> <b>port</b> would receive no income for facilities it was financing. <b>The</b> <b>port</b> received $3.3million in 2002 to upgrade and {{become a member of the}} Inland Distribution Network, a select group of ports that are used as satellite locations for the distribution of container cargo from <b>the</b> <b>Port</b> Authority of New York and New Jersey, resulting in less congestion at downstate ports and highways.|$|E
5|$|A final {{obstacle}} for <b>the</b> <b>Port</b> Authority {{was getting}} approval from New York City Mayor John Lindsay and the New York City Council, who {{raised concerns about}} the limited extent that <b>the</b> <b>Port</b> Authority involved {{the city in the}} negotiations and deliberations. Negotiations between The City of New York and <b>the</b> <b>Port</b> Authority were centered on tax issues. A final agreement was made on August 3, 1966, that <b>the</b> <b>Port</b> Authority would make annual payments to the City, in lieu of taxes, for the portion of the World Trade Center leased to private tenants. In subsequent years, the payments would rise as the real estate tax rate increased.|$|E

40|$|MM - P&DMIn March 2002, the Department of Transport {{published}} <b>the</b> <b>Ports</b> Policy with <b>the</b> {{objectives of}} ensuring affordable, internationally competitive, efficient and safe port services and of restructuring port governance and operations and subsequently regulating them. <b>The</b> 2005 <b>Ports</b> Act officially separated operations from a landlord function within ports and further established <b>the</b> <b>Ports</b> Authority to own, manage, control and administer ports {{to ensure their}} efficient economic functioning. <b>The</b> <b>Ports</b> Act also established <b>the</b> <b>Ports</b> Regulator to exercise economic regulation of <b>the</b> <b>ports</b> system as well as monitor the activities of <b>the</b> <b>Ports</b> Authority. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Ports</b> Regulations were developed, setting out the BEE targets that <b>the</b> <b>Ports</b> Authority should achieve {{in order to promote}} the economic participation and empowerment of historically disadvantaged groups in <b>port</b> operations. <b>The</b> Regulations further mandated <b>the</b> <b>Ports</b> Regulator to monitor and enforce implementation of the BEE targets when <b>the</b> <b>Ports</b> Authority would be issuing licences or granting concessions in port operations. This monitoring and enforcement function would be exercised through annual reports to be submitted by <b>the</b> <b>Ports</b> Authority, and through hearings that may be conducted by <b>the</b> <b>Ports</b> Regulator from time to time. This study found that the reasons for entrusting <b>the</b> <b>Ports</b> Regulator with <b>the</b> BEE monitoring and enforcement mandate, although not known to everybody, could have been orchestrated by Transnet because <b>the</b> <b>Ports</b> Regulator was seen to be less powerful than the Maritime BEE Charter Council. In addition, Transnet also developed guidelines for granting concessions, licences and permits for ‘auxiliary port services’ and not port operations. These would test the regulatory capability of <b>the</b> <b>Ports</b> Regulator hence it would require preventative enforcement measures in addition to harm-based enforcement measures that are in place (namely, annual reports and hearings). This study also established that having departmental officials on the Board of <b>the</b> <b>Ports</b> Regulator appeared to be in the latter’s best ii interests although it has to strengthen measures meant to curb the financial interests of board members and develop independent capacity for informationgathering, since implementing its mandate of monitoring and enforcing BEE will indeed be an intractable affair...|$|R
