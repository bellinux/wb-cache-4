5|$|For the book's 150th {{anniversary in}} 2011 the Royal Society of Chemistry planned to feature one of Beeton's recipes.

5|$|In 1959, Luba-Lulua {{animosity}} {{was brought}} to a head by {{the discovery of a}} colonial proposal to move Luba farmers out of Lulua land <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> fertile land on Luba territory. As a result, animosity rose and violent clashes broke out. In August 1959, Luba demonstrations against the plan which were violently repressed by the colonial military and police.|$|E
5|$|In {{neighbouring}} Denmark, motte-and-bailey castles appeared somewhat {{later in}} the 12th and 13th centuries and in more limited numbers than elsewhere, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> feudal society. Except {{for a handful of}} mote and bailey castles in Norway, built {{in the first half of}} the 11th century and including the royal residence in Oslo, the design did not play a role further north in Scandinavia.|$|E

5|$|After a brief {{stay with}} her still grieving parents in heavily bombed Portsmouth, Manning moved into a London flat. Reggie arrived {{during the summer of}} 1945, and found a job in the Features Department of the BBC. He was {{identified}} as a Communist spy by MI5 in 1947, and placed under surveillance. According to his file, Reggie had been working to increase Soviet influence in Romania and the Middle East throughout the war. Manning did not share her husband's political beliefs, but was quite aware that their phone was being tapped and feared that his open support for Communism would lead to him being sacked from the BBC. Reggie was soon transferred away from Features <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> politically sensitive Drama department. The surveillance stopped when he resigned from the Communist Party after the Russian invasion of Hungary in 1956.|$|E
5|$|After a broad {{review of}} its {{tactical}} force structure, the U.S. Air Force decided {{to adopt a}} low-cost aircraft to supplement the F-4 and F-111. It first focused on the Northrop F-5, which had air-to-air capability. A 1965 cost-effectiveness study shifted the focus from the F-5 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> expensive LTV A-7D, and a contract was awarded. However, this aircraft doubled in cost with demands for an upgraded engine and new avionics.|$|E
5|$|Although the Quiriguá elite {{were clearly}} Maya in ethnicity, the site {{lies on the}} {{southern}} periphery of the Mesoamerican area and the population was at least bi-ethnic, with ethnic Maya in a minority. The {{majority of the population}} belonged ethnically <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> complex Intermediate Area lying beyond the eastern border of Mesoamerica. The population density of the site has been estimated at 400 to 500 per square kilometer (1040 to 1300 per square mile) in the centre of the city during the Late Classic with an estimated peak population of 12001600; surveys have revealed an average of 130 structures per square kilometer (338 per square mile) at the site, compared with 1449 structures/km2 (3767 per square mile) in central Copán. The low population density indicates that Quiriguá served as the focus for a dispersed rural population.|$|E

5|$|As {{far back}} as the Iron Age, Welsh folk were using wild cereals to create a coarse bread. By the time the Romans invaded, Celtic skills with bread had progressed to the point that white or brown breads could be produced. The Roman {{invasion}} led to many Welsh people moving <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> hospitable uplands, where the only cereal crops which could be grown were oats, barley and rye. Oat and barley breads were the main breads eaten in Wales up until the 19th century, with rye bread created for medicinal purposes. Oats were used to bulk out meat or meat and vegetable stews, also known as pottage.|$|E
5|$|Mycena arcangeliana is {{somewhat}} similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> common Mycena flavescens, a species found in both hardwood and softwood forests {{on the floor}} among leaf or needle litter or grassland. M. flavescens typically has a whiter cap and a smell reminiscent of radish. M. peyerimhoffi, known from Algeria, has a similar cap colour to M. arcangeliana, but has a yellow stem. M. limonia, known from the Netherlands, has a lemon-yellow cap and stem and more gills. Another species similar in appearance is M. metata, which has a sweet taste.|$|E
5|$|Paris {{is a city}} {{of books}} and bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 percent of French-language {{publishing}} houses were found in Paris, almost all on the Left Bank in the 5th, 6th and 7th arrondissements. Since that time, because of high prices, some publishers have moved out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> expensive areas. It is also a city of small bookstores; There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot be discounted more than five percent below their publisher's cover price.|$|E

After these events, Tamagnino abandoned Brescia, probably never to return, leaving Cairano as the main sculptural worker in the city.|$|E
5|$|The high-budget pilot episode marked Cameron's {{television}} debut and {{was heavily}} promoted by Fox, reaching 17.4 million viewers. The first season, which was shown on Tuesday {{nights in the}} U.S., received mainly positive reviews and won several awards, including the People's Choice Award for Favorite New TV Drama. Alba's portrayal of Max also received mostly positive reviews and several awards. For the second season the show was moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> desirable air time of Friday night, and received some criticism for new plot elements. It suffered from a ratings drop, averaging 6 million viewers per episode, and was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} Vietnam's {{colonisation}} began in 1858 when a Franco-Spanish force landed at Da Nang in central Vietnam {{and attempted to}} proceed to the capital Hue. After becoming tied down, they sailed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> defended south, targeting Saigon. The southern offensive started on February 10, 1859 with a naval bombardment of Vũng Tàu. Within six days, the Europeans had levelled 12 Vietnamese fortresses and three river barriers. They then sailed along the Saigon River {{to the mouth of}} the Citadel of Saigon and opened fire with naval artillery from close range. The fort was manned by 1,000 soldiers and stored enough rice to feed 10,000 defenders for an entire year.|$|E

5|$|Agreeing to fund {{half of the}} {{proposed}} £1million budget, the Hong Kong Shaw Brothers became partners in the film's production. Elder brother Sir Run Run Shaw is credited as the presenter of Inseminoid in the opening titles. With a production staff of 75, principal photography commenced on 12 May 1980. John Metcalfe, camera operator for Satan's Slave and Terror, {{assumed the role of}} cinematographer. His former role fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> experienced Dick Pope. Three weeks of location filming at the Chislehurst Caves in Kent preceded a one-week indoor session at Lee International Studios at Wembley Park in London. The second unit completed special effects and linking shots in a fifth week, based at Film House in Wardour Street. To simulate the desolate landscape of the alien planet in long shots, the production team departed for the island of Gozo off Malta for a final shoot of two days, capitalising on the strong Mediterranean sun to produce good lighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} Ahmose's pyramid in Abydos were {{discovered}} in 1899 and identified as his in 1902. Most of its outer casing stones had been robbed for use in other building projects over the years, and the mound of rubble upon which it was built has collapsed. However, two rows of intact casing stones were found by Arthur Mace, who estimated its steep slope as about 60 degrees, {{based on the evidence}} of the limestone casing (compare <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> acute 51 degrees of the Great Pyramid of Giza). Adjacent to the main pyramid temple and to its east, Harvey has identified two temples constructed by Ahmose's queen, Ahmose-Nefertary. One of these structures also bears bricks stamped with the name of Chief Treasurer Neferperet, the official responsible for re-opening the stone quarries at el-Ma'asara (Tura) in Ahmose's year 22. A third, larger temple (Temple C) is similar to the pyramid temple in form and scale, but its stamped bricks and details of decoration reinforce that it was a cult place for Ahmose-Nefertary.|$|E

50|$|During {{the controversies}} between the probabilists and the probabiliorists, the system known as Æquiprobabilism was not clearly brought into prominence. Æquiprobabilism holds {{that it is}} not lawful <b>to</b> follow <b>the</b> <b>less</b> safe opinion when the safe opinion is {{certainly}} more probable; {{that it is not}} lawful <b>to</b> act on <b>the</b> <b>less</b> safe opinion even when it is equally probable with the safe opinion, if the uncertainty regards the cessation of a law; but that if the existence of the law is in question, it is lawful <b>to</b> follow <b>the</b> <b>less</b> safe opinion if it has equal or nearly equal probability with the safe opinion. Many of the moderate probabilists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries foreshadowed in their writings <b>the</b> theory <b>to</b> which, in his later-days, St. Alphonsus adhered.|$|R
