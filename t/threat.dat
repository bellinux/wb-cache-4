At the time the harbour at Taranto contained six battleships (five of them battle-worthy), seven heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and eight destroyers.

5|$|Both sexes are {{involved}} in defending the territory. One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying {{the proximity of the}} <b>threat</b> based on the loudness of bird song as well as the level of degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions, and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories, such as songs under foliage. Song degradation {{can also be used to}} determine the proximity of potential intruders. If the song of a bird appears to be degraded, the wrens will assume that the <b>threat</b> is distant not respond; if the song is not degraded, they respond by attacking. Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies. Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as 'dear-enemies' by the wrens, and the responses to neighbors and intruders in their territories differ by the season. In spring, the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors, though in the fall, no major discrepancy in responses is shown. When protecting their nest, alarm calls are the general response. The wrens judge the size of the potential <b>threat,</b> such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking. Countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive <b>threat</b> to male Carolina wrens.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{voluntary}} HIV testing behaviour {{among young}} adults in two Cape Town townships. Despite exceptionally high HIV prevalence rates, South Africa experiences {{low rates of}} HIV testing. Low levels of testing are worrisome because knowledge of HIV status {{is thought to be}} a key element in both the prevention of HIV transmission and the provision of care and treatment for those who are infected. Through qualitative in-depth interviews with 15 young adults (9 female, 6 male), this study found that choices regarding the voluntary uptake of HIV testing were strongly linked to the perceived implications of the HIV test. An analysis of the findings illustrates that study participants perceived HIV positive people to experience a number of <b>threats</b> because of their status – namely physical <b>threats,</b> social <b>threats,</b> and psychological <b>threats</b> – and that HIV testing served to either mitigate or expose an individual to these <b>threats.</b> Physical <b>threats</b> posed by HIV, such as opportunistic infections or death, encouraged HIV testing because it was only through testing that these potential <b>threats</b> could be mitigated. Conversely, an HIV test exposed an individual to social <b>threats,</b> such as ostracism and shame, and psychological <b>threats,</b> such as depression and self-rejection. Where social and psychological <b>threats</b> were perceived to be strong, testing was actively avoided. The findings of this study are that the decision to voluntarily test for HIV can be explained through a balance of the physical, social, and psychological <b>threats</b> that one can mitigate or be exposed to through testing for HIV. Using a threat-balance model, the analysis of findings shows that when study participants perceived physical <b>threats</b> to outweigh perceived social and psychological <b>threats</b> of living with HIV, they were biased towards testing. When they viewed social and psychological <b>threats</b> to outweigh physical <b>threats,</b> they were biased against testing. The focus on perceived <b>threats</b> of living with HIV highlights the need to focus on the social and psychological aspects of HIV/AIDS disease and illness, and not simply the clinical diagnosis and treatment of symptoms, both of which focus on physical <b>threats.</b> Because enhanced infrastructural resources for HIV testing and the availability of ARVs for mitigation of the physical <b>threats</b> alone do not encourage HIV testing, a 2 comprehensive plan to increase HIV testing must also seek to reduce the social and psychological <b>threats</b> presented by HIV infection...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{evolution}} of information, communication and entertainment technologies will transform {{the lives of}} citizens and ultimately transform society. This paper focuses on ethical issues associated with the likely convergence of virtual realities (VR) and social networks (SNs), hereafter VRSNs. We examine a scenario in which a significant segment of the world’s population has a presence in a VRSN. Given the pace of technological development and the popularity of these new forms of social interaction, this scenario is plausible. However, it brings with it ethical problems. Two central ethical issues are addressed: those of privacy and those of autonomy. VRSNs pose <b>threats</b> to both privacy and autonomy. The <b>threats</b> to privacy can be broadly categorized as <b>threats</b> to informational privacy, <b>threats</b> to physical privacy, and <b>threats</b> to associational privacy. Each of these <b>threats</b> is further subdivided. The <b>threats</b> to autonomy can be broadly categorized as <b>threats</b> to freedom, to knowledge and to authenticity. Again, these three <b>threats</b> are divided into subcategories. Having categorized the main <b>threats</b> posed by VRSNs, a number of recommendations are provided so that policy-makers, developers, and users can make the best possible use of VRSNs...|$|R
