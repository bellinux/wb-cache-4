500|$|On May 18, 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle {{reported}} that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided {{it did not}} [...] "infringe on {{the integrity of the}} roster or of the season", so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player. A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, [...] "One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just want to see if I deserve <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> If I don't, just get rid of me, release me. And if I belong, you don't have to pay me but the minimum — and I'll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how's that hurtin' anybody?... Don't say goodbye for me... When I want that one day they want to give me so bad, I'll let you know." [...] The Athletics retired Henderson's #24 on August 1, 2009.|$|E
500|$|With {{the release}} of Mauboy's second studio album Get 'Em Girls, some critics {{felt that she was}} {{becoming}} an [...] "R sexpot". Both the album and its title track also received negative reviews from critics. The music video for the title track was heavily criticised by fans who felt that Mauboy had become too sexy and moved away from her good girl image. Speaking of Mauboy's image for R music, Fairfax Media journalist Bernard Zuel said: [...] "It's a problem, matching the personality to a formula. The formula with young women singing modern R is that they have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> sexually, thrusting physically and vocally. But that's just not who she is." [...] Following {{the release of}} her single [...] "Gotcha" [...] in 2012, Miranda Cashin of Sunshine Coast Daily noted that it was [...] "a return to the Mauboy [...] before the infamous 2010 sexed-up fist-pumping album, Get 'Em Girls".|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé's {{performance}} {{also received}} positive response from celebrities and fans. US First Lady Michelle Obama, {{who attended the}} show said, [...] "Beyoncé stepped up {{in a way that}} so many of our celebrities and athletes are stepping up on behalf of this issue, so I love her to death and was glad <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> moving my body with her." [...] Governor of New Jersey Christopher J. Christie used his Twitter account to write that everything about the show was [...] "great". Beyoncé's husband and rapper Jay-Z, also wrote on Twitter that Beyoncé was the [...] "best performer in the world". A writer of Complex magazine further discussed his statements, [...] "Sure, he's married to her... But upon further reflection, he just might have a point. What other artist out there gives the type of live performance she does on a nightly basis? Who can give you that incredible voice singing power ballads and up-tempo dance cuts—while dancing?... In a world with hotshots like Lady Gaga, legends like U2, and even Jay-Z and Kanye West's The Throne bodying stages worldwide, is Beyoncé best performer on earth?".|$|E

500|$|In March 2013, {{researchers}} {{published the}} DNA {{sequence of the}} genome of a strain of HeLa cells. The Lacks family discovered this when the author Rebecca Skloot informed them. There were objections from the Lacks family about the genetic information that was available for public access. [...] Jeri Lacks Whye, a grandchild of Henrietta Lacks, said to The New York Times, [...] "the biggest concern was privacy - what information was actually going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> about our grandmother, and what information they can obtain from her sequencing that will tell them about her children and grandchildren and going down the line". [...] That same year another group working on a different HeLa cell line's genome under NIH funding submitted it for publication. In August 2013, an agreement was announced between {{the family and the}} National Institutes of Health that gave the family some control over access to the cells' DNA sequence found in the two studies along with a promise of acknowledgement in scientific papers. In addition, two family members will join the six-member committee which will regulate access to the sequence data.|$|E
500|$|In another interview, Ehrich {{expressed}} more of {{his opinions}} on the storyline, stating: [...] "It’s so relevant now and it’s such an epidemic. Just for it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> {{to show that it}} happens. This is a real issue that needs to be addressed. To be a part of that, and to spread awareness feels so nice because I’ve personally experience bullying and I know many friends who have. Whether people’s reason behind it are good or bad, nonetheless, it affects kids to such an extent especially young, vulnerable kids." [...] Of the character's [...] "dark side", Ehrich stated: [...] "I love playing dark, but justifiably dark. It's never coming from a psychopathic place. First, he got obsessed with Summer, and that caused the bullying storyline, and now he's dealing with his parents' problems and possible divorce. Fenmore's issues come from a place that makes sense. It's interesting, because everyone around him is pretty much lying, and Fen {{is supposed to be the}} crazy one. Yet he's actually the truthful one." [...] He also stated that [...] "as an actor, it's fun to go out of control", saying: [...] "As an actor, it’s fun when you’re out of control, and you don’t even know you’re acting. Like, literally, you just escape. And I got to feel that. And I’ve had numerous times on this show where I’ve gotten to be out of control, and it’s a really nice feeling. It’s exhilarating." [...] He also revealed that he had been listening to the music of John Mayer and Bruno Mars to get into Fenmore's head space. Ehrich also conceded that he didn't want Fenmore to go [...] "too far", saying: [...] "He's a really troubled kid who is just trying to find his way in life. He's not evil. I don't think he's asking for too much except for some love and trust. He's on a journey—a long, long journey to find some peace." ...|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, the MBTA {{has stopped}} running around 1 am each night, {{despite the fact}} that bars and clubs in most areas of Boston are open until 2 am. Like nearly all subways worldwide, the MBTA's subway does not have {{parallel}} express and local tracks, so much rail maintenance is only done when the trains are not running. An MBTA spokesperson has said, [...] "with a 109-year-old system you have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> every night" [...] to do necessary maintenance. The MBTA did experiment with [...] "Night Owl" [...] substitute bus service from 2001 to 2005, but abandoned it because of insufficient ridership, citing a $7.53 per rider cost to keep the service open, five times the cost per passenger of an average bus route.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 April 2010, Ochoa {{released}} a statement indicating her intent to retire from professional golf.

She said that her career plan had always been to play for [...] "around ten years" [...] and to be the number 1 ranked player in the world. She also said: [...] "I {{just want to be}} honest with all of you. I went to Asia, and after two or three days of being in Thailand, it was really easy to me – it was really clear to see that I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> you know.

6000|$|And {{now for the}} sequel. You {{know what}} it is when a big river breaks up and a few billion tons of ice go out, jamming and milling and grinding. Just in the thick of it, when the Stewart went out, {{rumbling}} and roaring, we sighted Spot out in the middle. He’d got caught as he was trying to cross up above somewhere. Steve and I yelled and shouted and ran up and down the bank, tossing our hats in the air. Sometimes we’d stop and hug each other, we were that boisterous, for we saw Spot’s finish. He didn’t have a chance in a million. He didn’t have any chance at all. After the ice-run, we got into a canoe and paddled down to the Yukon, and down the Yukon to Dawson, stopping to feed up for a week at the cabins at the mouth of Henderson Creek. And as we came in to the bank at Dawson, there sat that Spot, waiting for us, his ears pricked up, his tail wagging, his mouth smiling, extending a hearty welcome to us.
