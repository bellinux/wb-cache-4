An advantage of using ballast tractors {{is the ability}} to push-steer a trailer around a corner. A girder trailer, for example, is double-articulated so the front tractor can pull the load around a corner while the rear tractor pushes it through, thereby making the load more manoeuvrable than a simple <b>towing</b> <b>configuration.</b> Use of a following tractor also can increase control and brake force descending an incline.|$|E
40|$|During a {{submerged}} towing {{operation of}} a subsea module, the vessel motions combined with the hydrodynamic properties of the considered module will induce drag forces and dynamic loads on the <b>towing</b> <b>configuration.</b> These loads are important when evaluating different submerged towing concepts and will have implications for structural design {{with respect to the}} relevant limit states. However, since it is difficult to quantify the hydrodynamic properties of the towed module, model tests are useful for verifying coefficients which are further used in dynamic analyses of the <b>towing</b> <b>configuration.</b> The objective {{of this paper is to}} present an analysis methodology for determination of dynamic forces and hydrodynamic properties of a marine structure during a submerged towing operation. Emphasis is made on a simple analytical model of the dynamic forces based on DNV-RP-H 103, and a detailed multibody time integration by means of the MARINTEK computer program SIMO (Simulation of complex marine operations). In order to model the submerged towing operation in SIMO, hydrodynamic properties of the considered towed structure are determined based on analytical formulas presented in DNV-RP-H 103. The results from the SIMO model are in addition compared with measured response obtained from an experimental investigation. In general it is found that there is good agreement between experimental and calculated values when the hydrodynamic properties of the components have been identified. 1...|$|E

40|$|A recent {{development}} in bottom trawling {{is the use}} of twin trawl equipment, where two trawl nets are towed side by side from a single vessel. This increases the catch rate and efficiently of the trawler. Governed by cost and catch optimization, the use of twin trawl systems are expected to become more popular in the future. Using two trawl nets will, in addition to trawl doors on each side, require a heavy clump weight in the middle to prevent the trawl nets lifting from the seabed. The largest clump weights can have a mass up to 9000 kg and can cause substantial load towed across subsea pipelines, and may in many cases be the governing design load with respect to external loads in pipeline design. The main objective in this thesis work was to simulate and investigate pull-over forces from clump weights on free spanning pipelines. All simulations were carried out in the computer software SIMLA. Six different small scale tests were simulated in order to verify the finite element model, a very good agreement was obtained. Design loads from trawl gear are generally implemented according to DNV-RP-F 111. The calculation methods provided in this recommended practice are based on the same small scale tests which was made available to this thesis work for verification purposes. The validity range of DNV-RP-F 111 reflects the range of the small scale tests i. e. only valid for rigid pipelines. The effect of increasing pipeline flexibility was investigated. Simulations were carried out for span heights 0. 25 m, 0. 50 m and 0. 75 m for a 12 ” pipeline. Two different pipeline models was applied, a 25 m rigid pipeline model with spring representing the lateral pipeline stiffness, and a 1000 m pipeline model including realistic soil resistance. The major finding was that pull-over forces decrease for increasing pipeline flexibility. Compared to DNV-RP-F 111 the obtained pull-over loads was found considerably lower, both in magnitude and duration. To avoid over-conservatism it is thus recommended that a design method accounting for pipeline flexibility should be developed and used in future pipeline designs. The effect of warp angle was simulated varying the warp line length from 2. 5 to 3. 5 times the water depth. The horizontal pull-over force was found to increase for increasing warp line length. Regarding clump weight design and <b>towing</b> <b>configuration,</b> simulations have shown that a forward clump weight center of gravity will reduce the pull-over loads. Applying a lower warp line attachment point resulted in a more uniform sliding motion of the clump weight during interference and pull-over loads was almost complete reduced to a case of initial impact. It is thus suggested that future clump weight design should reflect this to reduce interference loads on both trawl gear and subsea pipelines. </p...|$|E

The tests with the direct coupling also included a study of the effect of spring restraint in roll in order to simulate approximately the proposed full-scale arrangement in which the only freedom is that permitted by the flexibility of the launching and retrieving trapeze carried by the-bomber.

40|$|Abstract Grasping and {{fixturing}} {{are concerned}} with immobilizing objects. Most prior {{work in this area}} uses a small number of contacts that is sufficient for force closure. However, for delicate objects or surfaces such as glass or bone (in medical applications), a larger number of contacts can be used to reduce the forces needed at each contact to resist applied wrenches. We focus on the problem of choosing a set of contact points out of a larger set of candidates to optimize grasp quality, which is defined as the size of the ball in wrench space that can be resisted given a constraint on each contact force or the sum of the contact forces. In purely geometric terms, our algorithms select a set of vectors out of a larger set of candidates to maximize the residual radius of the Minkowski sum or convex hull. We provide a method that is guaranteed to find near-optimal solutions in linear time. At the core of our approach are (i) an novel formula for the quality functions, and a discretization technique that evaluates them with bounded error, (ii) the insight that the resulting problem is a submodular coverage problem. This allows us to exploit the submodular saturation algorithm, which has recently been derived for applications in sensor placement. Our alternative formulas also makes it possible relax the optimization problem into a linear program, and we give a branch-and-bound procedure for exactly optimizing the objective. Our approach is applicable in situations with or without friction, for a large class of friction models. We also show that grasp quality metrics are relevant to towing (carrying a heavy object with aerial vehicles), and describe how to use the same methods to find optimal <b>towing</b> <b>configurations.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This is the publisher’s final pdf. The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the American Meteorological Society {{and can be}} found at: [URL] echo sounders designed to map and discriminate organisms in the water column have primarily been deployed on ships. Because of acoustic attenuation of higher frequencies used to detect and discriminate micronekton and nekton, this has effectively restricted the range of this information to the upper water column. In an effort to overcome these range limitations by reducing the distance between the transducer and the targets of interest, dual-frequency (38 and 120 kHz) split-beam echo sounders were integrated into a Remote Environmental Monitoring Units (REMUS) 600 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), effectively doubling the range of quantitative acoustic data into the mesopelagic zone (600 – 1200 m). Data from the first set of missions in a range of conditions revealed that the AUV provided a stable platform for the echo sounders and improved vertical and horizontal positional accuracy over echo sounders towed by ships. In comparison to hull-mounted echo sounders, elimination of ship noise and surface bubbles provided a 17 - and 19 -dBW decrease in the noise floor for the 38 - and 120 -kHz echo sounders, respectively, effectively increasing the sampling range by 30 %– 40 %. The extended depth range also increased the resolution of the acoustic horizontal footprint from 37 – 40 to 0. 6 – 3. 7 m, enabling discrimination of individual targets at depth. Also developed here is novel onboard echo sounder data processing and autonomy to allow sampling not feasible in a surface ship or <b>towed</b> <b>configuration.</b> Taken together, these data demonstrate an effective new tool for examining the biology of animals in the mesopelagic zone (600 – 1200 m) in ways previously only possible in the upper ocean...|$|R

40|$|High-rise {{residential}} {{tower is}} an inevitable and prevalent building type in high-density {{areas such as}} China. Because of the large population such buildings accommodate, {{improving the quality of}} people's lives in these towers has significant meaning. One of the important problems in such environments is the loss of identity of individual homes. This occurs because living spaces cannot fit individual families' unique and changing physical and spiritual needs. People can identify their lives and express their individual values in their homes in only the most meager ways. Consequently, people and their communities suffer deeply for the loss of identity of individual homes. The first focus of this thesis is to bring the question of individual control into light with the issue of identity of individual homes. Identity of any built environment results from the interplay of both shared values and individual values. In an identifiable and accommodating environment, both value sets should be in balance, over time. In high-rise residential towers, individual values are hardly presented {{because of the lack of}} individual control. So the radical way to establish identity of individual homes is to enable individual control in the building process. The second focus of this thesis is a study in architectural design of the distribution of control in such high-rise environments. Two kinds of individual controls are assumed and distributed: the control of the dwelling layouts and the control of dwelling unit facades. To enable these <b>tow</b> <b>configurations</b> of parts to be subject to individual control, propositions for setting up a new balance between centrally controlled parts and individually controlled parts in high-rise residential towers are put forward. To demonstrate these propositions, a specific high-rise residential tower in Beijing is redesigned to the solution of technical problems, regulatory issues and conventions when control is distributed. Individual control of both the dwelling layouts and the facades are simulated in a methodical way. Finally, notes about supportive products and management techniques, broader developments in other types of high-rise buildings, and the cultivation of shared values out of individual values are offered.

40|$|The Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS) {{continues}} to invest significant resources into seafloor mapping activities along Washington’s outer coast (Intelmann and Cochrane 2006; Intelmann et al. 2006; Intelmann 2006). Results from these annual mapping efforts offer {{a snapshot of}} current ground conditions, help to guide research and management activities, and provide a baseline for assessing the impacts of various threats to important habitat. During the months of August 2004 and May and July 2005, we used side scan sonar to image several regions of the sea floor in the northern OCNMS, and the data were mosaicked at 1 -meter pixel resolution. Video from a towed camera sled, bathymetry data, sedimentary samples and side scan sonar mapping were integrated to describe geological and biological aspects of habitat. Polygon features were created and attributed with a hierarchical deep-water marine benthic classification scheme (Greene et al. 1999). For three small areas that were mapped with both side scan sonar and multibeam echosounder, we made a comparison of output from the classified images indicating little difference in results between the two methods. With these considerations, backscatter derived from multibeam bathymetry is currently a costefficient and safe method for seabed imaging in the shallow (< 30 meters) rocky waters of OCNMS. The image quality is sufficient for classification purposes, the associated depths provide further descriptive value and risks to gear are minimized. In shallow waters (< 30 meters) which {{do not have a}} high incidence of dangerous rock pinnacles, a towed multi-beam side scan sonar could provide a better option for obtaining seafloor imagery due to the high rate of acquisition speed and high image quality, however the high probability of losing or damaging such a costly system when deployed as a <b>towed</b> <b>configuration</b> in the extremely rugose nearshore zones within OCNMS is a financially risky proposition. The development of newer technologies such as intereferometric multibeam systems and bathymetric side scan systems could also provide great potential for mapping these nearshore rocky areas as they allow for high speed data acquisition, produce precisely geo-referenced side scan imagery to bathymetry, and do not experience the angular depth dependency associated with multibeam echosounders allowing larger range scales to be used in shallower water. As such, further investigation of these systems is needed to assess their efficiency and utility in these environments compared to traditional side scan sonar and multibeam bathymetry.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Complex {{nonlinear}} {{and chaotic}} responses have been recently observed in various compliant ocean systems. These systems {{are characterized by}} a nonlinear mooring restoring force and a coupled fluid-structure interaction exciting force. A general class of ocean mooring system models is formulated by incorporating a variable mooring configuration and the exact form of the hydrodynamic excitation. The multi-degree of freedom system, subjected to combined parametric and external excitation, is shown to be complex, coupled and strongly nonlinear. Stability analysis by a Liapunov function approach reveals global system attraction which ensures that solutions remain bounded for small excitation. Construction of the system's Poincare map and stability analysis of the map's fixed points correspond to system stability of near resonance periodic orbits. Investigation of nonresonant solutions is done by a local variational approach. Tangent and period doubling bifurcations are identified by both local stability analysis techniques and are further investigated to reveal global bifurcations. Application of Melnikov's method to the perturbed averaged system provides an approximate criterion {{for the existence of}} transverse homoclinic orbits resulting in chaotic system dynamics. Further stability analysis of the subharmonic and ultraharmonic solutions reveals a cascade of period doubling which is shown to evolve to a strange attractor. Investigation of the bifurcation criteria obtained reveals a steady state superstructure in the bifurcation set. This superstructure identifies a similar bifurcation pattern of coexisting solutions in the sub, ultra and ultrasubharmonic domains. Within this structure strange attractors appear when a period doubling sequence is infinite and when abrupt changes in the size of an attractor occur near tangent bifurcations. Parametric analysis of system instabilities reveals the influence of the convective inertial force which can not be neglected for large response and the bias induced by the quadratic viscous drag is found to be a controlling mechanism even for moderate sea states. Thus, stability analyses of a nonlinear ocean mooring system by semi-analytical methods reveal the existence of bifurcations identifying complex periodic and aperiodic nonlinear phenomena. The results obtained apply to a variety of nonlinear ocean mooring and <b>towing</b> system <b>configurations.</b> Extensions and applications of this research are discussed...|$|R

In particular, when {{it is assumed that}} the signal wavefront is planar at the array, the bearing of the source is estimated, and when a spherically curved wavefront is considered, the range and cross-range of the source are estimated. The ability to retrieve source location information is affected by the values of unknown nuisance parameters and additive, uncorrelated noise in the space-time data received by the array. Under various assumptions about the source, the estimation accuracies of different array configurations are compared within the framework of Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analysis. The CRLBs establish absolute bounds on location estimation variance.

A sizable literature {{exists on the}} theory of processing signals for many vector sensor array applications.

Processing techniques should be robust to these system imperfections and practical complexities. This thesis presents analytical results which quantify the effect of system mismatch and low sample support on acoustic vector sensor array performance. All arrays are susceptible to perturbations in array element locations; vector sensor arrays, however, are also sensitive to changes in sensor orientation. This {{is due to the}} fact that the particle motion vector measurement must be placed in a global reference frame. Gilbert and Morgan (1955) developed a statistical analysis with system mismatch for an array of scalar, omnidirectional elements. This thesis includes a vector sensor extension to their analysis by including sensor orientation perturbations. Theoretical expressions for the mean and variance of the vector sensor array spatial response are derived using a Gaussian perturbation model, with excellent comparisons between theory and simulation. Such analysis leads to insight into theoretical limits of both conventional and adaptive processing in the presence of system imperfections. One noteworthy result is that the vector aspect of the array "dampens" the effect of array mismatch, enabling deeper true nulls. This is accomplished because the variance of the vector sensor array spatial response (due to rotational, positional and filter gain/phase perturbations) decreases in the side lobes, unlike arrays of omnidirectional hydrophones. (cont.) As long as sensor orientation is measured within a reasonable tolerance, the beampattern variance dominates the average side lobe power response. Results from random matrix theory are used to characterize the effect of low sample support on signal detection using a vector sensor array. When using vector sensors, the effects of low sample support potentially increase by a factor of four since each element in a vector sensor array consists of a scalar hydrophone and up to three spatially orthogonal particle motion sensors. Also presented is an analysis of vector sensor array performance in ocean noise given an arbitrary spatial array configuration, sensor orientation and particle motion sensor type (velocity or acceleration). Several different ocean noise models exist, including isotropic noise, directional noise and realistic surface generated noise. Theoretical expressions are derived for array data covariance matrices in these different noise models for arbitrary array configuration and sensor orientation, which can in turn be used with optimal MVDR beamforming weights to analyze array gain. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we present examples of signal, noise and array gain variability as a function of mismatch intensity. Our analysis suggests that vector sensor array gain performance is less sensitive to rotational than to positional perturbations in the regions of interest. Hydrophones and particle motion sensors have very different response and noise characteristics. For instance, particle motion sensors are more sensitive to non acoustic, motion-induced noise than hydrophones. In a <b>towed</b> line array <b>configuration,</b> those sensors orthogonal to the direction of motion are exposed to higher intensities of flow noise at low frequencies than those coincident to the array axis. (cont.) Similarly, different dipole sensors may be exposed to varying degrees of rotational mismatch. Sensors may also rest on the seafloor, creating asymmetries. Recognizing these practical issues, we derive a new adaptive processing method customized to the unique characteristics of vector sensors and robust to mismatch and finite sample support. This new approach involves using multiple white noise gain constraints. During the past couple of decades, stationary vector sensor arrays have been built and tested, demonstrating improved gain and ambiguity lobe attenuation. Up until recently, however, very few towed vector sensor arrays had been built and tested. As such, many of the advantages of vector sensor arrays had only previously been shown in theory and/or with stationary arrays. We present results from sea trials in Monterey Bay, CA (2006) and Dabob Bay, WA (2007) towing a relatively short vector sensor array. Results highlight several of the distinct practical advantages of vector sensor arrays: resolution of spatial ambiguity (e. g., port/starboard and conical ambiguity), the ability to "undersample" an acoustic wave without spatial aliasing, quiet target recovery via clutter reduction, immunity to mismatch, improved array gain and enhanced detection performance. by Andrew Joseph Poulsen.
