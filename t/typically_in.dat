In nuclear engineering, the (n,n') reactions of 113In and 115In are used to determine magnitudes of neutron fluxes.|$|E
5|$|Low-energy {{electron}} diffraction (LEED) is {{a method}} of bombarding a crystalline material with a collimated beam of electrons and then observing the resulting diffraction patterns to determine {{the structure of the}} material. The required energy of the electrons is <b>typically</b> <b>in</b> the range 20–200eV. The reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique uses the reflection of a beam of electrons fired at various low angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials. The beam energy is <b>typically</b> <b>in</b> the range 8–20keV and the angle of incidence is 1–4°.|$|E

5|$|Psilocybe semilanceata fruits solitarily or {{in groups}} on rich and acidic soil, <b>typically</b> <b>in</b> grasslands, such as meadows, {{pastures}}, or lawns.

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, <b>typically</b> <b>in</b> bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes drum, {{although}} the male does {{so much more}} often, mostly from mid-January until the young are fledged. The far-carrying drumming is faster than for any other woodpecker in its range at around 10–16strikes per second, <b>typically</b> <b>in</b> one-second bursts, although repeated frequently. As late as {{the early twentieth century}} it was thought that the drumming might be a vocalisation, and it was not until 1943 that it was finally proved to be purely mechanical.|$|E

Marsh Inc., located immediately below Cantor Fitzgerald on floors 93–100, lost 358 employees, and 175 employees of Aon Corporation were also killed. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that about 17,400 civilians were in the World Trade Center complex {{at the time of the}} attacks. Turnstile counts from the Port Authority suggest 14,154 people were <b>typically</b> <b>in</b> the Twin Towers by 8:45a.m. Most people below the impact zone safely evacuated the buildings.|$|E

5|$|Civilian Public Service men {{lived in}} barracks-style camps, such as former Civilian Conservation Corps facilities. The camps {{served as a}} base of operations, from which the COs {{departed}} to their daily assignments. Sites were located <b>typically</b> <b>in</b> rural areas near the agricultural, soil conservation and forestry projects where the work took place. A large camp such as number 57 near Hill City, South Dakota, had five dormitories and housed as many as 172 men building the Deerfield Dam. Later, with projects located in urban areas, the men lived in smaller units, communal housing near their assignments. CPS men typically worked nine hours, six days per week.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} varies {{during the}} lifespan of an individual. Researchers have more specifically described cognitive flexibility as {{the capacity to}} shift or switch one’s thinking and attention between different tasks or operations <b>typically</b> <b>in</b> response {{to a change in}} rules or demands. For example, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they are able to successfully switch from sorting cards based on the color of the object to sorting based on the type of object on the card.|$|E
5|$|Further {{dividing}} {{the varieties of}} fancy rats are the many different markings. Pet rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings. The markings are <b>typically</b> <b>in</b> reference to the patterns and ratios of colored hair versus white hair.

40|$|Developmental disabilities, {{including}} learning difficulties (LD), attention-deficit {{hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are syndromes that have unclear etiologies and are diagnosed {{on the basis}} of their clinical features. Developmental disabilities show high rates of comorbidity, resulting in similar clinical pictures in many cases. However, these similar clinical pictures may be based on different underlying factors that can be determined by microscopic observation or tests. In this study, differential assessments that were based on research using laboratory-based cognitive tasks were proposed for differentiating between the underlying factors that contribute to similar clinical pictures of developmental disabilities. These factors, which should be treated using a different therapeutic approach, include the following: 1) error monitoring (the primary deficit <b>typically</b> observed <b>in</b> LD) and mental effort (<b>typically</b> observed <b>in</b> ADHD) with respect to careless mistakes; 2) response decision (<b>typically</b> observed <b>in</b> ADHD) and motor inhibition (<b>typically</b> observed <b>in</b> oppositional defiant disorder/conduct disorder) with respect to behavioural inhibition and 3) preattentive processing (<b>typically</b> observed <b>in</b> LD) and weak central coherence (<b>typically</b> observed <b>in</b> ASD) with respect to global perception. These differential assessments may provide detailed and individualized understanding and support to individuals with developmental disabilities and critical information for the differential diagnosis of developmental disabilities...|$|R
5|$|Mature bulls {{can weigh}} up to 800 {{kilograms}} (1,800pounds) and cows can weigh up to 500 kilograms (1,100pounds). Cows typically have {{a height of}} 90–106centimeters (3–3.5ft), and bulls are <b>typically</b> <b>in</b> the range of 106–120centimeters (3.5–4ft). Mating occurs throughout the year with a gestation period of approximately 277–290 days. Most commonly a single calf is born, but twins are not unknown. Sexual maturity is reached at about eighteen months. Highland cattle also have a longer expected lifespan than most other breeds of cattle, up to 20 years.|$|E
