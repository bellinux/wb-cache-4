5|$|At the 1911 Imperial Conference Australia {{expressed}} concern about Japan's growing naval power and {{it was agreed that}} the British government would consult Australia when negotiating renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. It was also decided that the Royal Navy would continue to support the RAN and provide blue-water defence capability in the Pacific and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> war the ships of the RAN would be transferred to British Admiralty control. Under the Naval Defence Act (1912) the power to make the transfer was conferred in the Governor-General. The RAN would become the Australia Squadron of the Royal Navy with all ships and personnel under the direct control of the British Admiralty, while the RAN remained responsible for the upkeep of the ships and training.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 he {{made the}} {{decision}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{going to be a}} war, {{he wanted to be a}} fighter pilot, and so immediately joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. Within three months Lock had been called up and began flight training. On the outbreak of War in September 1939, as a trained pilot Lock joined the RAF as a sergeant pilot. After further training at No. 6 Flying School RAF Little Rissington, he was commissioned as a pilot officer (service number 81642) and posted to No. 41 Squadron at RAF Catterick, North Yorkshire, flying Spitfires.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an {{underground}} car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes and the Bible. The McCanns' lawyer said <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E

25|$|Multiple causes {{exist for}} AI {{in the setting}} of {{ascending}} aortic dissection. The dissection may dilate the annulus of the aortic valve, so that the leaflets of the valve cannot coapt. Another mechanism is that the dissection may extend into the aortic root and detach the aortic valve leaflets. The third mechanism is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an extensive intimal tear, the intimal flap may prolapse into the LV outflow tract, causing intimal intussusception into the aortic valve preventing proper valve closure.|$|E

He stated <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an available government post, Griffin should be hired.

25|$|The CMB {{essentially}} {{confirms the}} Big Bang theory. In the late 1940s Alpher and Herman reasoned <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a big bang, {{the expansion of}} the universe would have stretched and cooled the high-energy radiation of the very early universe into the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and down to a temperature of about 5K. They were slightly off with their estimate, but they had exactly the right idea. They predicted the CMB. It took another 15 years for Penzias and Wilson to stumble into discovering that the microwave background was actually there.|$|E
25|$|Manned {{observation}} balloons, floating {{high above}} the trenches, were used as stationary reconnaissance platforms, reporting enemy movements and directing artillery. Balloons commonly had a crew of two, equipped with parachutes, so <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an enemy air attack the crew could parachute to safety. At the time, parachutes were too heavy {{to be used by}} pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output), and smaller versions were not developed {{until the end of the}} war; they were also opposed by the British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.|$|E

25|$|Henriques further {{argues that}} {{developing}} {{such a system}} for integrating knowledge {{is not just an}} academic enterprise. He suggests that in an increasingly complex world, the fragmented state of knowledge can be seen {{as one of the most}} pressing social problems of our time. Henriques also believes that history seems to attest that the absence of a collective worldview ostensibly condemns humanity to an endless series of conflicts that inevitably stem from incompatible, partially correct, locally situated justification systems. Thus, from Henriques' perspective, there are good reasons for believing <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a shared, general background of explanation, humanity might be able to achieve much greater levels of harmonious relations.|$|E
25|$|No {{significant}} {{contact with}} inhabitants {{in the area}} was recorded for decades, until {{around the time of}} the Crimean War (1853–56). British admirals arranged with Chief Joe Capilano <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an invasion, the British would defend the south shore of Burrard Inlet and the Squamish would defend the north. The British gave him and his men 60 muskets. Although the attack anticipated by the British never came, the guns were used by the Squamish to repel an attack by an indigenous raid from the Euclataws. Stanley Park was not attacked, but this was when it started to be thought of as a strategic military position.|$|E
25|$|Frigg, a major goddess and Odin's wife, {{says that}} what Loki and Odin {{did in the}} ancient past should not be spoken of in front of others, and that ancient matters should always remain hidden. Loki brings up that Frigg is the {{daughter}} of Fjörgyn, a personification of the earth, and that she had once taken Odin's brothers Vili and Vé into her embrace. Frigg responds <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a boy like her now-deceased son Baldr in the hall, Loki {{would not be able to}} escape from the wrath of the gods.

Although she {{had been one of the}} favourites during the pre-contest period, she only managed to get 9th place with 128 points (hers was one of the two pre-qualified entries to finish in the top 10, the other being Romania). The other eight songs were all qualified from the semi-final. Finland won the contest with the rock band Lordi and their song Hard Rock Hallelujah. In interviews prior to the contest, she had stated <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> anyone she would like to lose to, it would be the Finnish entry. Lordi had also expressed their liking of the Greek song in interviews, too.|$|E
25|$|In {{his review}} (collected in The Present as History, 1953) Marxist Paul Sweezy joked that Hayek {{would have you}} believe <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an {{over-production}} of baby carriages, the central planners would then order the population to have more babies instead of simply warehousing the temporary excess of carriages and decreasing production for next year. The cybernetic arguments of Stafford Beer in his 1974 CBC Massey Lectures, Designing Freedom – that intelligent adaptive planning can increase freedom – are of interest in this regard, as is the technical work of Herbert A. Simon and Albert Ando on the dynamics of hierarchical nearly decomposable systems in economics – namely, that everything in such a system is not tightly coupled to everything else.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} week of November, Gazprom CEO Miller {{announced}} that if no agreement was reached {{by the end of the}} year, prices could rise significantly higher than what was currently being proposed. A few days later Prime Minister Putin warned <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any interference with transit gas, supplies to Ukraine would be cut off. These warnings were repeated throughout December, with additional warnings that disruptions to European supplies could result. The European Commission did not attempt to intervene, but the Energy Charter Secretariat issued a statement on December 23 which recalled the principle of uninterrupted transit. This was seen as a reminder to Ukraine of its obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty, which it has signed and, unlike Russia, ratified.|$|E
