5|$|In January 2001, {{plans were}} drawn up <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 55,000-seat {{purpose-built}} arena {{on the site}} of the King's Dock in Liverpool. The proposed stadium would have had a retractable roof enabling it to be used for concerts and chairman Bill Kenwright had hoped to have it ready for the 2005–06 season.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of her {{grandson}} in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> nursing home. Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in her hands. According to one of her doctors, she had hitherto been healthy but began showing signs of senescence (or aging) at this point.|$|E
5|$|Following Walker's death, alumni and {{students}} began {{to raise funds}} to construct a monument {{to him and his}} fifteen years as leader of the university. Although the funds were easily raised, plans were delayed for over two decades as MIT made plans <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new campus on the western bank of the Charles River in Cambridge. The new Beaux-Arts campus opened in 1916, and featured a neo-classical Walker Memorial building housing a gymnasium, students' club and lounge, and a commons room.|$|E

50|$|The student-produced school newspaper, The Caledonian, {{appears to}} be the first in the area <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> online news {{production}} model.|$|R
5|$|Mary's job {{enabled the}} McCartneys <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> ground-floor flat at 75 Sir Thomas White Gardens, off St. Domingo Road in Everton, {{to live in}} a rent-free flat that was {{supplied}} by her employers. They moved shortly after, in February 1946, to 72 Western Avenue in Speke. In 1948, the family moved again to 12 Ardwick Road (also in Speke) which was part of a new estate in the suburbs of Liverpool. The frequent moves to better areas were Mary's idea, as she wanted to raise her children in the best neighbourhood possible.|$|E
5|$|Ross felt {{strongly}} that the state should adequately care for its veterans. During his first term, the first Confederate home in Texas was dedicated in Austin. Within two years, the facility {{had run out of}} room, so Ross served as chairman of a committee to finance a relocation to a larger facility. By August 1890, the home had collected enough money <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> larger location.|$|E
5|$|The Flames {{are also}} close {{partners}} with the Alberta Children's Hospital and the Gordon Townsend School housed within. Among the many activities the Flames participate in, the Wheelchair Hockey Challenge with the Townsend Tigers {{has remained a}} highly popular tradition for both {{the players and the}} children involved. In 2010, the Tigers defeated the Flames <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> perfect 27–0 record since the challenge was first instituted in 1981.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 Disjecta {{had plans}} <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{expanded}} 20,000 sf space in North Park Blocks. The plans were launched {{with a high}} profile party.|$|R

5|$|Years later, Carl {{still lives}} in the house, stubbornly holding out while the {{neighborhood}} homes are torn down and replaced by skyscrapers. When he accidentally injures a construction worker, the court deems him a public menace, ordering him <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> retirement home. However, Carl resolves to keep his promise to Ellie by turning his house into a makeshift airship, using thousands of helium balloons. Russell, a young Wilderness Explorer who visited Carl in his effort to earn his final merit badge, for assisting the elderly, becomes an accidental stowaway.|$|E
5|$|According to William of Tyre, on 27 July the crusaders {{decided to}} move to the plain on {{the eastern side of the}} city, which was less heavily {{fortified}} but had much less food and water. It was recorded by some that Unur had bribed the leaders <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> less defensible position, and that Unur had promised to break off his alliance with Nur ad-Din if the crusaders went home. Meanwhile, Nur ad-Din and Saif ad-Din had by now arrived. With Nur ad-Din in the field it was impossible to return to their better position. The local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege, and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city. First Conrad, then the rest of the army, decided to retreat to Jerusalem on 28 July, though for their entire retreat they were followed by Turkish archers who constantly harassed them.|$|E
5|$|As Palmyra gained {{importance}} to French efforts to pacify the Syrian Desert, a base {{was constructed in}} the village near the Temple of Bel in 1921. In 1929 the general director of antiquities in Syria, Henri Arnold Seyrig, began excavating the ruins and convinced the villagers <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new, French-built village next to the site. The relocation was completed in 1932; ancient Palmyra was ready for excavation as its villagers settled into the new village of Tadmur. During World War II, the Mandate came {{under the authority of}} Vichy France, who gave permission to Nazi Germany to use the airfield at Palmyra; forces of Free France, backed by British forces, invaded Syria in June 1941, and on 3 July 1941, the British took control over the city {{in the aftermath of a}} battle.|$|E

5000|$|... 1887 The Deutsche Neuguinea-Kompagnie {{abandons}} Finschhafen {{because of}} malaria and decides <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> agricultural station at nearby Stephensort/Bogadjim. The Lutheran mission stayed on in Finschhafen and expanded its influence along coastal villages.|$|R
5000|$|Kieppi : A park {{model that}} {{opened at the}} Linnanmäki park in Finland in 2003. The ride closed in 2016, and it is {{believed}} <b>to</b> be scheduled <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unknown location outside of Finland.|$|R
5|$|Brumfield {{arrived by}} {{helicopter}} {{on the morning}} of 8 November, just as A Company was preparing to depart from its night location at 08:00. With contact now seeming unlikely to the Australians, Healy was instructed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rendezvous from which the battalion would be extracted back to Bien Hoa the following day. A Company subsequently set out on a compass bearing which would take them across the northern edge of the Gang Toi plateau. By 10:30 the Australians moved out in single file but had not gone far before a lone Viet Cong scout was observed shadowing them; he was subsequently shot and killed by the rear section. Crossing a creek line the Australians uncovered a company-sized camp of dugouts and trenches, before being fired upon at 15:40 by a single Viet Cong soldier who then fled. A Company halted briefly, and at this time two Viet Cong approached their position, before being killed by 1 Platoon.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1942 Cardus {{rented a}} small flat in the Kings Cross {{district}} of Sydney, where {{he wrote his}} Ten Composers (1945) and Autobiography (1947). He said later that he found the discipline of writing for seven hours a day difficult at first, but that the process had turned him from a journalist into something more substantial. When later in 1942 his wife announced her intention of sailing from England to join him, Cardus declined <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> larger flat to accommodate them both, and rented a separate establishment for her a mile away. They dined together once a week, but otherwise continued to lead largely separate lives.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invocation}} {{and the performance}} of the United States National Anthem, the children of the late sports marketer Ed Shull gave the command for drivers to start their engines. On the pace laps, Johnson, after changing his engine, and teammate Earnhardt, who had <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> back-up car, had to fall behind all the other drivers in the event after doing major changes during practice. At the start, Newman was the leader going through the first corner, but on the same lap Menard, with pushing assistance from Martin, passed him. On the second lap, the first caution was given because Newman spun sideways in the second turn but avoided impacting the wall. During the caution, he drove to pit road for a pit stop.|$|E
50|$|Eunice Sanders was Hillside's {{principal}} from 2002 to 2006, resigning {{after the}} 2005-2006 school year <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> administrative {{position within the}} Durham Public Schools Central Office. Earl Pappy was the principal of Hillside from 2006 to 2009.|$|R
50|$|Thermotaxis is a {{migration}} along a gradient of temperature. Some slime molds {{and small}} nematodes can migrate along amazingly small temperature gradients {{of less than}} 0.1 °C/cm. They apparently use this behaviour <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> optimal level in soil.|$|R
5000|$|Problems {{associated}} with doctors' illegible handwriting were highlighted in a Care Quality Commission report in May 2014, which also criticised the food {{as not being}} healthy enough and lacking variety. The Trust are hoping <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> Electronic patient record system.|$|R
5|$|For the {{following}} 19 months, the club played games away from Valley Parade. Cherry {{and the players}} became a close-knit team, attending funerals of the victims and other engagements {{in the months that}} followed, and the club's 13th place finish in Division Two in 1985–86 was hailed a major achievement. During Bradford's time away from Valley Parade, McCall also turned his back on Leeds United, the team he had supported as a child, after their fans set fire to a chip van at Odsal Stadium. McCall became club captain in November 1986, aged just 21, after Peter Jackson moved to Newcastle United. Under Cherry's replacement, Terry Dolan, the club held off any relegation threats to finish tenth in 1986–87. Like Jackson, McCall and Hendrie were both keen <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Division One club, but they agreed in 1987 to stay for one final season.|$|E
5|$|Geraldine Ferraro {{was born}} on August 26, 1935 in Newburgh, New York, the {{daughter}} of Antonetta L. Ferraro (née Corrieri), a first-generation Italian American seamstress, and Dominick Ferraro, an Italian immigrant (from Marcianise, Campania) and owner of two restaurants. She had three brothers born before her, but one died in infancy and another at age three. Ferraro attended the parochial school Mount Saint Mary's in Newburgh when she was young. Her father {{died of a heart}} attack in , when she was eight. Ferraro's mother soon invested and lost the remainder of the family's money, forcing the family <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> low-income area in the South Bronx while Ferraro's mother worked in the garment industry to support them.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{graduated}} from Harvard Law School in 1896 {{at the age}} of 24. He returned to Albany to live with his mother and aunt, and started work for the law firm in which an uncle, Matthew Hale, was a partner. Hale's unexpected death a few months later obliged Hand <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new firm, but by 1899, he had become a partner. He had difficulty attracting his own clients, however, and found the work trivial and dull. Much of his time was spent researching and writing briefs, with few opportunities for the appellate work he preferred. His early courtroom appearances, when they came, were frequently difficult, sapping his fragile self-confidence. He began to fear that he lacked the ability to think on his feet in court.|$|E
50|$|After {{the bombing}} of Pearl Harbor, Takamoto's family, like many Japanese Americans, was forced <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{internment}} camp. They {{spent the rest of}} World War II in the Manzanar internment camp. It was there that Takamoto received basic illustration training from two co-internees.|$|R
50|$|As of 2007, Bill Pearce also stopped {{recording}} {{his radio}} program NightSounds. It remains in syndication {{both on the}} internet and on Christian radio stations, in reruns. He <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> Florida for <b>a</b> few years, but opted <b>to</b> <b>move</b> back <b>to</b> Pennsylvania. Later he decided <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> assisted living home in Ohio.|$|R
50|$|Conflict between {{engineering}} and marketing grew with engineering wanting <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> all software approach. Allchin, {{the driving force}} in Banyan's software engineering group, and Mahoney, CEO, conflicted over this direction and ultimately this led to Allchin leaving for Microsoft. Allchin's <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Microsoft was widely publicized.|$|R
5|$|In 1791 and 1792, Fray José Francisco Garza befriended {{some of the}} Karankawa {{and other}} native peoples. Their {{friendship}} allowed Garza to explore much of the coastal areas that had been too dangerous to visit. The Indians requested that Garza build a mission at the junction of the San Antonio and Guadalupe Rivers, and in February 1793 Mission Nuestra Señora del Refugio opened near Mission Lake {{at the head of}} San Antonio Bay. Over 230Indians lived at the mission initially, but within two years they were forced <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> less flood-prone site, which became known as Refugio. By {{the end of the eighteenth}} century, only a small number of the hunting and gathering tribes within Texas had not been Christianized. In 1793, mission San Antonio de Valero was secularized, and the following year the four remaining missions at San Antonio were partially secularized.|$|E
5|$|In April 1889, a {{resolution}} was passed for Millwall to drop 'Rovers' from their name {{and they were}} now playing under the name Millwall Athletic, inspired by their move to their new home The Athletic Grounds. They were founding members of the Southern Football League which they won {{for the first two}} years of its existence, and were runners-up in its third. They were forced <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new ground North Greenwich in 1901, as the Millwall Dock Company wanted to use their land as a timberyard. Millwall Athletic reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1900 and 1903, and were also champions of the Western Football League in 1908 and 1909.|$|E
5|$|In July, 1983, Mercyful Fate {{recorded}} {{their debut}} album at Easy Sound Recording, in Copenhagen, Denmark. Entitled Melissa, {{the album was}} produced by Henrik Lund and released on October 30, 1983 on Roadrunner Records. After a number of concerts around Denmark, Mercyful Fate entered the studio in May 1984 to record their second studio album Don't Break the Oath, which was released on September 7, 1984. During the album's supporting tour, the band played the US for two months and made festival appearances in Germany. Despite winning a cult following around the world, Mercyful Fate broke up in April, 1985, due to musical differences. Guitarist Hank Shermann wanted the band <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more commercial sound; King Diamond refused and announced his departure from Mercyful Fate, {{which led to the}} band breaking-up.|$|E
50|$|After Bissen's death, the {{premises}} were {{taken over by}} his son Vilhelm Bissen. He continued to work at Materialgården but gave up the residence after <b>a</b> few years <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> apartment in Vester Voldgade. Jens Adolf Jerichau also worked at Materialgården before moving to Charlottenborg.|$|R
5000|$|... "So {{basically}} I'm taking {{seven weeks}} off. With pay heh heh." [...] — {{at the end}} of Dan Ingram's final Friday afternoon on the air. Ingram was expecting <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> upcoming satellite oldies service named Superradio (however, the service did not sign up enough affiliates to launch).|$|R
50|$|In {{role-playing}} games, secret passages, like traps, can {{be found}} in all sorts of buildings, especially in dungeons and castles in high fantasy role-playing games. The mansion in the board game Cluedo (Clue) has two secret passages that players can use <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> opposite corner of the board.|$|R
