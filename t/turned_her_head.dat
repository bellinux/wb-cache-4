5|$|Individual {{athletes have}} {{also used the}} Olympic stage to promote their own {{political}} agenda. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, two American track and field athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who finished first and third in the 200metres, performed the Black Power salute on the victory stand. The second-place finisher, Peter Norman of Australia, wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge in support of Smith and Carlos. In response to the protest, IOC president Avery Brundage told the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to either send the two athletes home or withdraw the track and field team. The USOC opted for the former. During the same Olympics, Czechoslovakian gymnast Věra Čáslavská announced her protest to the Soviet-led invasion of her home country after controversially receiving Silver on the Beam and a shared Gold on the Floor. During the Soviet anthem, Čáslavská <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> down {{and to the right}} of the Soviet flag in order to make a statement over the invasion and the Soviet influence of the sport of Gymnastics. Returning home, Čáslavská was made an outcast by the Soviet government and was banned from competition and travelling.|$|E
25|$|Helen is safely away {{to recover}} from her concussion. Inspector Morton asks each family member to account for {{themselves}} {{on the day of}} Cora Lansquenet's murder after which Poirot makes a surprising statement which shocked everyone present. Cora had not come to the funeral at all. It was Miss Gilchrist in disguise, as part of a plot for her own gain, leaving Cora home asleep from a sedative in her tea. Miss Gilchrist planted the idea that Richard Abernethie's death had been a murder - when Cora is murdered, it would seem that Richard's alleged murderer had killed Cora to silence her. None of the family had seen Cora for more than two decades, due to the ill-feeling {{at the time of her}} marriage. Miss Gilchrist copied her mannerisms and the only flaw in her portrayal was spotted by Helen Abernethie - Miss Gilchrist had rehearsed a characteristic turn of the head in a mirror, where the reflection is a reverse of reality; when she came to the house after the funeral, she <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to the left, not the right. After a timely conversation among the young cousins, Helen realises this difference. Miss Gilchrist gave herself away to Poirot by referring to the wax flowers on the green malachite table the first day the relatives gathered to select objects before the auction: these were on display on the day of the reading of Richard Abernethie's will but removed by the time Miss Gilchrist, as herself, visited Enderby Hall. She had deliberately poisoned herself with the arsenic-laced wedding cake to evade suspicion and appear yet another potential victim, which aroused suspicion.|$|E
2500|$|The large canvas {{is almost}} square in format and unusually monumental for a beach view. The life-size women {{depicted}} are Sorolla's wife Clotilde and his eldest daughter Maria. Sorolla painted the scenery at the Playa de El Cabanyal beach {{in his hometown}} of Valencia. Both women lean forward slightly, so that they appear to move toward the right edge. While the wife stands straight, aligned to the edge, the daughter Maria has slightly <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to her right shoulder and is looking towards the viewer.|$|E
6000|$|She never <b>turns</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Lady or servant, she has {{a purpose}} in her and can follow it.

Still, she does not <b>turn</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> until she has landed on the other side. Then she slightly beckons to him and says, [...] "Come here!" ...|$|R

Any revulsion they might feel from fat-ass bastards they ran up against professionally was ad hominem and not ad genus [...] Mary <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> away in revulsion. I felt no revulsion for her maternal fantasies, only a practical concern. She met his advances with revulsion. [...] Pam was driven to revulsion (by {{the sight of the}} dead animal) 〈*The sight of the dead animal drove Pam to revulsion〉. Revulsion at slaughter cut war short [...]|$|E
2500|$|After {{the wedding}} ceremony, the royal {{procession}} was {{heading back to}} the Royal Palace when an assassination attempt was made on the King and Queen. When anarchist Mateu Morral threw a bomb from a balcony at the royal carriage. Victoria Eugenie's life was saved because, at the exact moment the bomb exploded, she <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> in order to see St. Mary's Church, which Alfonso was showing her. She escaped injury, although her dress was spotted with the blood of a guard who was riding beside the carriage. [...] There exists a large statue in front of the Royal Monastery of San Jeronimo dedicated to the victims of the bombing of May 31, 1906.|$|E
