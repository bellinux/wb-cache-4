25|$|When {{paleontology}} uncovered {{three million}} years' worth of human generations, making it untenable that humanity, agriculture, and civilization all began {{at roughly the}} same <b>time,</b> <b>our</b> worldview was still not affected. Instead, humanity used terms like “pre-history” and “Agricultural Revolution” to label these events, rather than grafting their ramifications into our societal fabric.|$|E

An end must be put to these traitors once and for all so that our men on the front lines can fight without fear of being stabbed in the back.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} new Liberalism {{did not seem}} much more piquant or fertile than the respectable old. As it happened, in the fulness of <b>time</b> <b>our</b> {{distinguished}} apostles of Efficiency came into supreme power, with {{a share in the}} finest field for efficient diplomacy and an armed struggle, that could have been imagined. Unhappily they broke down, or thought they had (1915), and could discover no better way out of their scrape than to seek deliverance (not without a trace of arbitrary proscription) from the opposing party that counted Liberalism, old or new, for dangerous and deluding moonshine.|$|E

500|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} {{is often}} portrayed {{to oppose the}} concept of gradualism, when it is actually a form of gradualism. This is because even though evolutionary change appears instantaneous between geological sedimentary layers, change is still occurring incrementally, with no great change {{from one generation to}} the next. To this end, Gould later commented that [...] "Most of our paleontological colleagues missed this insight because they had not studied evolutionary theory and either did not know about allopatric speciation or had not considered its translation to geological <b>time.</b> <b>Our</b> evolutionary colleagues also failed to grasp the implication(s), primarily because they did not think at geological scales".|$|E

5000|$|The New York Times {{review of}} The <b>Time</b> of <b>Our</b> <b>Time</b> characterizes {{the work as}} a “neatly interwoven” {{collection}} that tells a story of its own, a “social history of postwar America, {{at the heart of}} which is Mailer's own tangled love affair with this country.” And while “Mailer's technical skills may not have declined in the ensuing decades, his cultural authority has, and The <b>Time</b> of <b>Our</b> <b>Time</b> offers some clues as to why.” [...] Meanwhile, a review on The Hudson Review admits that despite “all its weaknesses,” The <b>Time</b> of <b>Our</b> <b>Time</b> “does add up to a relatively coherent subjective account of our times,” covering such topics as the Cold War, the Kennedy assassination, the civil rights and antiwar movements, the moon landing, women’s lib, and Watergate, among others.|$|R

500|$|Takei's {{appearance}} as Ricardio gained critical favor.

[...] Tyler Foster of DVD Talk called Ricardio {{one of the highlights of}} the season. The A.V. Club reviewer Oliver Sava, in a review for [...] "Lady & Peebles", wrote that Ricardio is [...] "always welcome on this series, largely due to Takei’s delightful voice work." [...] Furthermore, he praised the way that Takei delivered his lines, noting that [...] "there’s a theatrical smarminess to his vocals that is a stark contrast to the Ice King’s nasality", and that [...] "Takei always sounds like he’s having a great time reading the ridiculous lines that are written for him." ...|$|E
500|$|Over ominous keys, a {{keyboard}} opening and a repeating drum loop {{in the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings about how her relationship turned sour and puts all her cards on the table, [...] "I told you how you hurt me, baby / But you don't care / Now I'm crying and deserted, baby / But you don't care / Ain't nobody tell me this is love / You're immune to all my pain / I need {{you to tell me}} this love / You don't care, well, that's OK". While singing the first and second verses, she pulls out the power in her lower register. Each time, her voice slowly builds until the commanding chorus is reached, where towards the end, she sings, [...] "la la la", in a muted saxophone line. Her voice expresses anger as she sings the chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé continues the [...] "wild-eyed pleas", as stated by Guerra and sings the lines, [...] "Even since you knew your power / you made me cry / And now every <b>time</b> <b>our</b> love goes sour / you won't sympathize". Her raw vocals then punch through most powerfully at the second chorus leading up to the bridge. After the bridge, Beyoncé, this time, scats the chorus alongside a multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E

500|$|On January 28, 2008, Radar Online {{reported}} that the Church of Scientology asked the U.S. Attorney General's office in Los Angeles, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Los Angeles Police Department to start a criminal investigation of possible criminal activity related to the DDoS attacks. An unnamed source told Radar that the Church of Scientology argued to law enforcement that the Internet attacks are a form of [...] "illegal interference with business." [...] Radar also {{reported that}} in statements to law enforcement the Church of Scientology emphasized {{its status as a}} religious organization in the United States in order to assert that the DDoS attacks can be classed as hate crimes. The day after the Church of Scientology complained to law enforcement about the DDoS attacks, one of the main Project Chanology sites was down, and a message on the site said that their site crashed due to attacks from Scientologists. In a statement issued to Wikinews, a Church of Scientology employee confirmed that actions of Anonymous had been reported to law enforcement: [...] "Activities of Anonymous have been reported to the Authorities and actions are being taken.

We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling". In September 2015, Feige elaborated on the films referencing the television series, saying [...] "I think that's inevitable at some point ...
