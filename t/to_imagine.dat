40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} young women's weight-influenced self-esteem (WISE) in response <b>to</b> <b>imagined</b> weight gain and weight loss, and its relations to body satisfaction, body comparisons and global self-esteem. Young women {{from two different}} regions, that is, from the north of The Netherlands (n = 157) and from the Willemstad area (the capital of Curacao; n = 162), completed a questionnaire. It was expected that Dutch women would show lower self-esteem in response <b>to</b> <b>imagined</b> weight gain than women from Curacao, and that self-esteem in response <b>to</b> <b>imagined</b> weight gain would be negatively related to general self-esteem and body satisfaction, and more so among Dutch women than among Curacaoan women. Finally, {{it was expected that}} body comparisons would be predictive of lower self-esteem in response <b>to</b> <b>imagined</b> weight gain. As expected Dutch women showed lower self-esteem in response <b>to</b> <b>imagined</b> weight gain than Curacaoan women. Moreover, findings showed that among Curacaoan women self-esteem in response <b>to</b> <b>imagined</b> weight gain was not related to general self-esteem or body satisfaction and that body comparisons were less predictive of lowered self-esteem in response <b>to</b> <b>imagined</b> weight gain than among Dutch women. Findings are discussed in light of cultural differences in ideal body shape and the supportiveness of women's social networks...|$|R
40|$|As human possess {{powerful}} incest-avoidance mechanisms (which likely evolved due to {{the high}} costs of inbreeding), reactions to incestuous sexual encounters may be psychologically distinct from reactions to non-incestuous (but still non-normative) sexual encounters. Accordingly, variables such as sex and sociosexuality that normally predict openness to sexual encounters in other situations (i. e., men and sociosexually unrestricted people tend to be more sexually willing) may not do so - or do so only weakly - in incestuous situations. In Study 1, sociosexuality predicted negative judgments of non-incestuous (but still normatively proscribed) sexual acts, but not judgments of incestuous sexual acts. In Study 2, sociosexuality predicted negative reactions <b>to</b> <b>imagined</b> sex with biologically unrelated (but still normatively unusual) partners, but not reactions <b>to</b> <b>imagined</b> sex with related partners (this effect was limited to women); also, men reacted less negatively than women <b>to</b> <b>imagined</b> sex with unrelated partners, but men and women reacted equally negatively <b>to</b> <b>imagined</b> sex with related partners (the latter effect was limited to sociosexually restricted men).

40|$|Abstract: We {{examined}} {{relations among}} Mating Effort, Mate Value, Sex and individuals’ self-reported responses <b>to</b> <b>imagined</b> sexual or emotional infidelity. We {{asked participants to}} describe the (1) upset or bother (2) aversive emotional reactions (3) punitive impulses, and (4) punitive intentions they experienced in response <b>to</b> <b>imagined</b> sexual or emotional infidelity. The results replicated previously documented sex differences in jealousy. In addition, imagined sexual infidelity upset individuals higher in Mating Effort more than those lower in Mating Effort. Higher Mating Effort also predicted greater temptation, intention, and likelihood to engage in punitive behaviors in response <b>to</b> <b>imagined</b> sexual or emotional infidelity. We discuss these data in light of individual differences in relations between reproductive strategy and romantic jealousy. Additionally, we point {{to the importance of}} controlling for co-linearity between reactions to sexual and emotional infidelity, and the need for addressing related methodological problems within jealousy research...|$|R
5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E

In another interview, Nomura implied both characters are related, specifically to Sora, but he wanted fans <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> reasons for such connection. The guidebook Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Ultimania clarified the connection, stating that Roxas and Ventus look alike because Ventus' heart entered Sora's body and Roxas' birth allowed Ventus to influence his appearance. In early versions of development, Nomura planned to have Ventus' broken heart be healed by the heart of Sora before he was born, but after negative feedback from overseas coworkers it was abandoned.

5|$|Science {{fiction and}} fantasy have {{traditionally}} been puritanical genres aimed at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. However, speculative fiction also gives authors and readers the freedom <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> societies that are different from real-life cultures. This freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias, by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed by critics such as Nicola Griffith that LGBT readers identify strongly with the mutants, aliens, and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction.|$|E

5|$|After that season, coach Alex Hannum {{wanted to}} be closer to his family on the West Coast; he left the Sixers to coach the Oakland Oaks in the newly founded American Basketball Association. Chamberlain then asked for a trade, and Sixers general manager Jack Ramsay traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Darrall Imhoff, Archie Clark and Jerry Chambers. The {{motivation}} for this move remains in dispute. According to sportswriter Roland Lazenby, a journalist close to the Lakers, Chamberlain was angry at Kosloff for breaking the alleged Richman-Chamberlain deal, but according to Dr. Jack Ramsay, who was the Sixers general manager then, Chamberlain also threatened to jump to the ABA after Hannum left, and forced the trade himself.

5|$|Along the Western front these began quite early {{after the}} war and {{continued}} for several decades, dropping in number in the mid-1920s, when interest in the war temporarily diminished, and again in the Depression years of the early 1930s. Flemish pilgrimages to Belgium graves, particularly the heldenhuldezerkjes, and memorials began in 1919, continuing through the subsequent decades. The Ossuary at Verdun was the centre for many veterans pilgrimages in the 1920s, one of the better known groups being the Fêtes de la Bataille, which travelled to the site to undertake a vigil, processions and lay wreaths. These pilgrimages were typically low-key and avoided military symbolism or paraphernalia. Ypres became a pilgrimage destination for Britons <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> and share the sufferings of their men and gain a spiritual benefit; the Ypres League was established by veterans, and sought to transform the horrors of trench warfare into a purifying spiritual quest. The Menin Gate memorial became a focal point for British pilgrims to the Western front after it was opened in 1927. Pilgrims could come long distances: in the 1920s Canadians began to journey to Vimy and Australians began visiting Gallipoli from 1925 onwards, bringing back military souvenirs relics.|$|E
