In this paper, we utilize 2009 Nationwide Highway Travel Survey data and test the relationship between area commute-time means as well as variances in metropol-itan-area size. We include tests for metropolitan areas as a whole and for residents from urban, suburban, second city, and town-and-county areas. The regression analysis shows that all estimated slopes are statistically significant but not much greater than zero. Commute <b>time</b> means and <b>variances</b> are highly correlated. These relationships are also invariant with respect to the place of residence. An extensive collection of literature provides evidence for the co-location of workers and jobs hypothesis: average commute times do not rise appreciably as metropolitan population increases.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the optimal control {{algorithm}} for discrete time systems minimizing a quadratic cost functional is derived. The system considered {{is assumed to}} be linear and to possess an exogenous component. The cost functional is a quadratic tracking equation in which it is assumed that the weighting matrices are semi-positive definite. and moreover that a weighted sum of these matrices is positive definite. The time horizon considered is infinite. Two special cases of the obtained controller are the controller minimizing the infinite <b>time</b> Minimum <b>Variance</b> cost criterium and the LQ-regulator.

50|$|Mobile radio {{communication}} performance is significantly {{affected by the}} radio propagation environment. Blocking by buildings and natural obstacles creates multiple paths between the transmitter and the receiver, with different <b>time</b> <b>variances,</b> phases and attenuations. In a single-input, single-output (SISO) system, multiple propagation paths can create problems for signal optimization. However, based {{on the development of}} multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) systems, it can enhance channel capacity and improve QoS. In order to evaluate effectiveness of these multiple antenna systems, a measurement of the radio environment is needed. Channel sounding is such a technique that can estimate the channel characteristics for the simulation and design of antenna arrays.|$|R
40|$|The {{repeated}} transmissions of a tomography {{signal from}} an autonomous sound source placed on Davidson Seamount was continuously monitored by a bottom- lying, cabled-to-shore receiver on Sur Ridge. To address the signal stability, resolvability and identifiability criteria that determine {{the applicability of}} ocean tomography along this path, the data recorded from July 1998 to January 1999 were first processed to obtain the multipath pulse arrival structure and its variability in time. The processed signals showed strong arrivals that were both stable and resolvable. In order to identify the resolved arrivals, acoustic propagation modeling was performed using ray theory in conjunction with measured sound speed and high-resolution bathymetric data. A comparison of the predicted and measured arrival structures show that the observed arrivals were clearly identifiable and were made up of eigenray groups (i. e., eigenray tubes) instead of individual eigenrays. Since the eigenrays within each group {{were found to have}} almost identical trajectories through the ocean, the common passage along which the ray group integrates the ocean variability was unambiguous. Consistent with previous CalCOFI observations, the extracted ray group travel time series exhibited dominant oscillations with semidiurnal, diurnal, 8 -day, 18 -day and 26 - day periods, respectively. Using spectral estimation techniques, the travel <b>time</b> <b>variances</b> of these dominant oscillations were quantified. These travel <b>time</b> <b>variances</b> represent direct measurements of the variances of spatially averaged ocean temperatures. Therefore, they are useful for establishing the solution and noise variances for the construction of the inverse solution. Portuguese Navy author...|$|R

40|$|An {{extensive}} literature provides {{evidence for}} the co-location of workers and jobs hypothesis; average commute times do not rise appreciably as metropolitan population increases, suggesting that many employers and employees have co-located to accommodate metropolitan area growth. However, {{there has been much}} less attention paid to the relationship between commute <b>time</b> <b>variances</b> and city size. That would be a stronger test of the co-location hypothesis because variances are more sensitive to outlier values. In this study, we utilize 2009 Nationwide Highway Travel Survey data and test the relationship between area commute time means as well as variances with metropolitan area size. We include tests for metropolitan areas as a whole and for residents from urban, suburban, second city and town and county areas. The regression analysis shows all estimated slopes are statistically significant, but not much greater than zero; they are also invariant with respect to the place of residence.

40|$|Inventory {{management}} systems and dynamic reliability measures and controls remain challenging at every stage, especially when <b>time</b> <b>variances</b> and operating conditions are considered.

Also, a novel, reliability-based robust design optimization model has been developed to optimally allocate and schedule time while considering uncertainty associated with inventory movement.
