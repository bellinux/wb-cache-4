While there, he was permitted many visitors and organised secret communications with exiled ANC leader Oliver Tambo.|$|E
5|$|The {{combat system}} is turn-based instead of real-time. Gameplay is usually step-based, where player actions are {{performed}} serially {{and take a}} variable measure of in-game <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete.</b> Game processes (e.g., monster movement and interaction, progressive effects such as poisoning or starvation) advance based on {{the passage of time}} dictated by these actions. This requires the player to learn and apply tactics as they progress in the dungeon.|$|E
5|$|The {{coronation}} {{usually takes}} place {{several months after}} the death of the previous monarch, as it is considered a joyous occasion that would be inappropriate while mourning continues. This interval also gives the planners enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the elaborate arrangements required. For example, Queen ElizabethII was crowned on 2June 1953, having ascended the throne on 6February 1952; the date of her coronation was announced almost a year in advance, and preparations inside the abbey took five months.|$|E

5|$|Allenby {{reviewed}} {{the threat of}} counterattack and his supply situation and decided that a force large enough to attack into the Judean Hills and a separate force to operate on the maritime plain could be maintained far from base. He decided to quickly attack Fevzi Pasha's Ottoman 7th Army in the Judean Hills {{with the hope of}} capturing Jerusalem. This would keep pressure on this army in the hope of denying them <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> their reorganisation, dig deep trenches or worst of all, counterattack.|$|E
5|$|In late 2002 {{and early}} 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi {{disarmament}} mandates, precipitating a diplomatic crisis.

The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing {{the use of military}} force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.|$|E

5|$|Kumar {{requested}} Nagarjuna a year's <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> {{and provide}} the finishing touches to the script. The latter read the script to director K. Raghavendra Rao, who suggested Kumar develop a simpler version, as the original was too complicated. The rewritten version was read to Nagarjuna in {{two and a half}} hours and to Nageswara Rao over six hours, as the latter wanted every detail to be clear. Due to the complex nature of the second half, the latter suggested Kumar to add a comedy plotline between grandfather and grandson. After its incorporation into the script, and after considering the titles Hum and Trayam, Manam was chosen as the film's title on Nageswara Rao's suggestion.|$|E
5|$|One {{exception}} in this rule {{occurs when the}} defense makes at least one out and attempts to complete a double play or triple play. An error is not charged in that situation if a wild throw allows the runner to reach safely. If a wild throw allows the runner to advance an additional base, an error may then be charged for the additional advance. However, if an accurate throw is made in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> a double play or triple play, but the fielder on the base fails to make the catch, an error may be charged.|$|E
5|$|Owens did {{not have}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the shot before the Cannes screenings, but {{afterwards}} he used cineSync to conduct {{most of the work}} from home. The shot includes two blocks of computer-generated buildings that recede into the distance of a downtown set extension. As Collins disappears into the crowd about a minute into the shot, the live footage is gradually joined with more digital work. The streetcars, tracks and power lines were all computer generated. Live-action extras appear for the first minute of the shot before being replaced by digital ones. The shot was made more complicated by the need to add Massive extras. Owens constructed the scene by first building the digital foreground around the live action footage. He then added the background before filling the scene with vehicles and people.|$|E

She joined the 7th Fleet in the region, making a goodwill visit to South Korea and entertaining South Korean president Syngman Rhee and his wife Franziska Donner. {{and at the end}} of the tour returned to San Diego on 25 June 1950, the same day as the outbreak of the Korean War.

5|$|The highway {{designation}} {{was created}} in 1930 out of {{the southern end of}} US127. Three sets of reroutings through Adrian have resulted in the creation of two different business loops through the city. A change proposed in the 1960s and implemented in the 1970s shifted the southern end of US223 to replace M-151 and then run along the US23 freeway between Whiteford Township, Michigan, and Sylvania, Ohio. Since the 1980s, US223 no longer reaches Toledo, instead feeding into the freeway system for the city. Changes proposed and enacted into law in the 1990s would upgrade the highway as an Interstate Highway. Congress has designated this corridor as part of Interstate 73 (I-73), although neither state intends at this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the freeway.|$|E
5|$|The {{title was}} the first LucasArts {{adventure}} game to incorporate voice work on release. The game was not originally planned to include voice work, as at the time, the install base for CD-ROM was too low. As they neared the end of 1992, CD-ROM sales grew significantly. The general manager of LucasArts, Kelly Flock, recognizing that the game would not be done in time {{by the end of}} the year to make the holiday release, suggested that the team include voice work for the game, giving them more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the title.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} other formats used for bouldering {{competitions}}. Some competitions only permit climbers a fixed number of attempts at each {{problem with a}} timed rest period in between each attempt, unlike the IFSC format, in which competitors can use their allotted time however they choose. In an open-format competition, all climbers compete simultaneously, and are given a fixed amount of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> as many problems as possible. More points are awarded for more difficult problems, while points are deducted for multiple attempts on the same problem.|$|E
5|$|To this end, Stalin and Molotov {{strung out}} the {{negotiations}} with the Japanese, giving them false hope of a Soviet-mediated peace. At the same time, in their dealings with the United States and Britain, the Soviets insisted on strict adherence to the Cairo Declaration, re-affirmed at the Yalta Conference, that the Allies would not accept separate or conditional peace with Japan. The Japanese would have to surrender unconditionally to all the Allies. To prolong the war, the Soviets opposed any attempt to weaken this requirement. This would give the Soviets <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the transfer of their troops from the Western Front to the Far East, and conquer Manchuria (Manchukuo), Inner Mongolia (Mengjiang), Korea, South Sakhalin, the Kuriles, and possibly, Hokkaidō (starting with a landing at Rumoi).|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, the player must acquire twelve Artifacts, which are prizes that are awarded after {{completing}} objectives such as winning minigames or beating bosses. Once having acquired twelve Artifacts, the player is granted access to a table called the Artifact Temple, which places six balls on the table at the same <b>time.</b> <b>To</b> <b>complete</b> the table, twelve different targets must be hit with the balls while they are bombarded by attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the Metroid Prime series. If all of the balls are lost, the table ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve Artifacts already collected but is forced to revisit another table and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at the Artifact Temple. Upon completing the Artifact Temple, access is granted to the final table, Impact Crater. After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature on the Impact Crater table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode.|$|E
