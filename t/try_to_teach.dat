5|$|Saavedro is the {{antagonist}} of Exile. Depicted as a vengeful {{and broken}} man, Saavedro is an inhabitant of the Age of Narayan, {{one of the}} Ages chosen by Atrus to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> his sons Sirrus and Achenar about the Art of writing books linking to other worlds. Saavedro agrees to help tutor Atrus' sons, but is shocked when the brothers instigate a destructive rebellion and abandon the Age to be destroyed from within. When Saavedro pursues Sirrus and Achenar to the Age of J'nanin, he is assaulted and left for dead. Trapped on J'nanin and believing Narayan destroyed and his family to be dead, Saavedro's mental health deteriorates during his years of captivity. When Saavedro is unexpectedly freed and travels to Tomahna in hope of finding the brothers, he steals the linking book for Releeshahn in a plan to lure Atrus to Narayan and exact revenge. Once on Narayan, Saavedro discovers that his people have not been destroyed. Cornered by the Stranger, Saavedro gives up the Releeshahn book. In the game's optimal ending, the player enables Saavedro to peacefully return to Narayan, before taking Releeshahn back to Atrus. Saavedro is portrayed by veteran actor Brad Dourif, who accepted the role of Saavedro {{because he was a}} Myst fan. Dourif said that his role for the game was much more difficult than working on movie sets, as he could not see the player he was addressing or interact with the game environment.|$|E
25|$|Local Hong Kong {{media and}} {{professionals}} worried that Cheung's death would infect youth who {{looked up to}} him with sexual disorientation and queer ideologies, linking gay life to violence, depression, and suicide in order to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> young people to fear homosexuality. Many media outlets focused primarily on arguing about his queer identity instead of on his artistic achievement in film and music. Previous to his death, Cheung mentioned in interviews that he had become depressed because of negative comments about the gender-crossing in his Passion Tour concert. He had planned to retire from stage performance because of the strain of being a gay artist in Hong Kong, facing stigmatization, surveillance, and marginalization.|$|E

Steven Tucker of Bel Air, Maryland, and James D. Tucker of Douglasville, [...] Pennsylvania. He wrote {{magazine}} articles under a pen name and was interested in music and painting. Parrish was considered charming, witty, and likable. Looking younger than his years, he was also {{considered to be a}} ladies' man. Prior to being assigned to Tuskegee, he had not been actively involved with any of the black Americans' causes. Parrish had as a youth, however, hiked three miles to see where a black man had been lynched. He later recalled that when people heard of the project to train black pilots and mechanics, he often heard [...] "weird and worried kind of laughter" [...] from white people and that a visiting British flying ace once stated that it was better to have a [...] "Messerschmitt on his tail than to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> a Negro to fly".|$|E

2500|$|Although most {{chiropractic}} colleges <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> about vaccination in {{a manner}} consistent with scientific evidence, several have faculty who seem to stress negative views. A survey of a 1999–2000 cross-section of students of Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC), which does not formally teach anti-vaccination views, reported that fourth-year students opposed vaccination more strongly than did first-year students, with 29.4% of fourth-year students opposing vaccination. A follow-up study on 2011–12 CMCC students found that pro-vaccination attitudes heavily predominated. Students reported support rates ranging from 83.9% to 90%. One of the study's authors proposed the change in attitude to be due to the lack of the previous influence of a [...] "subgroup of some charismatic students who were enrolled at CMCC at the time, students who championed the Palmer postulates that advocated against the use of vaccination".|$|E
2500|$|When Khaled Musharraf {{learned of}} the killing of four {{political}} leaders in Dhaka Central Jail, he and some staff went to Bangabhaban to negotiate a peaceful transfer of power. Khandker Mushtaq and Osmani spent the day negotiating, and Shaffat Jamil came to Bangabhaban to meet Khalad Musharraf. As he and his soldiers entered the meeting room, he heard Khudker Mushtaq browbeating Khaled Musharraf: [...] "I have seen many brigadiers and general of [...] Pakistan Army! Don't <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> me." [...] This angered the CO of the 1st Bengal Company, who drew his gun and said: [...] "And now you will see majors of [...] Bangladesh Army." [...] Mushtaq dropped to the floor, Osmani stood {{between him and the}} officer and asked Shaffat Jamil to restore order. After Mushtaq resigned and a new government was formed, Osmani resigned his post.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{observers}} were more cautious. William Booth of The Washington Post {{wrote that the}} film depicts the Maya as a [...] "super-cruel, psycho-sadistic society on the skids, a ghoulscape engaged in widespread slavery, reckless sewage treatment and bad rave dancing, with a real lust for human blood." [...] Gibson compared the savagery in the film to the Bush administration, telling British film magazine Hotdog, [...] "The fear-mongering we depict in the film reminds me of President Bush and his guys." [...] Just prior to its release, Apocalypto was criticized by activists in Guatemala, including Lucio Yaxon, who charged that the trailer depicts Maya as savages. In her review of the film, anthropologist Traci Ardren wrote that Apocalypto was biased because [...] "no mention is made of the achievements in science and art, the profound spirituality and connection to agricultural cycles, or the engineering feats of Maya cities". Apocalypto also sparked a strong condemnation from art history professor Julia Guernsey, a Mesoamerican specialist, who said, [...] "I think it's despicable. It's offensive to Maya people. It's offensive {{to those of us}} who <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> cultural sensitivity and alternative world views that might not match our own 21st century Western ones but are nonetheless valid.".|$|E
