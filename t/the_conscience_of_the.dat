500|$|The {{original}} {{science fiction}} novel is about <b>the</b> ultimate inadequacy <b>of</b> communication {{between humans and}} other species. Tarkovsky's adaptation is a [...] "drama of grief and partial recovery" [...] concentrated upon <b>the</b> thoughts and <b>the</b> <b>consciences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cosmonaut scientists studying Solaris' mysterious ocean. In loyalty to the novel's complex and slow-paced narrative, Tarkovsky wanted to bring a new emotional and intellectual depth to the genre, viewing most of western science fiction as shallow. The ideas which Tarkovsky tried to express in this film are further developed in Stalker (1979).|$|R

500|$|After a day's rest, the marchers' {{main event}} on Tuesday {{was a public}} meeting in the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street. Among the guest {{speakers}} was the Rev. Canon Dick Sheppard, [...] founder of the Peace Pledge Union. He told the marchers: [...] "You have so aroused <b>the</b> <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country that things are bound to happen". Sir John Jarvis, without prior warning, then revealed plans for a steel tubes mill on the Palmers site. The impression that Jarrow's problems could be solved thus, without government action, disconcerted the listening marchers. Wilkinson commented that such plans were in the future, and were no substitute for the town's requirement for immediate government intervention.|$|E
500|$|Although Borah's career bridged two eras of reform, {{according}} to Ashby, [...] "emotionally and intellectually he belonged {{with the older}} prewar [...] America.

[...] Borah wrote in 1927, {{near the end of}} a decade of tumultuous change, [...] "I cannot think of any views which I now have that I did not have before the war." [...] In 1936, Time magazine noted that though Borah was the most famous senator of the century, and had long been [...] "the great Moral Force of the Senate... <b>the</b> <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country has been placed in other pockets".|$|E

This new style would make the novel a vehicle of hope and light in what he termed [...] "this night that threatens us now". It would be [...] "the affirmation of the optimism of those writers that defied the Inquisition, opening a breach in <b>the</b> <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people for the march of the Liberators".|$|E

500|$|Often this {{derives from}} a spiritual or natural law perspective, that for world peace to be achieved, conscience, {{properly}} understood, should be generally considered as not necessarily linked (often destructively) to fundamentalist religious ideologies, {{but as an}} aspect of universal consciousness, access to which is the common heritage of humanity. Thinking predicated {{on the development of}} world conscience is common to members of the Global Ecovillage Network such as the Findhorn Foundation, international conservation organisations like Fauna and Flora International, as well as performers of world music such as Alan Stivell.

500|$|The third main {{theory is}} that Quistclose trusts could be {{constructive}} trusts, which are created when the future trustee uses the money in an [...] "unconscionable" [...] manner. In Quistclose situations, the requirement of [...] "unconscionableness" [...] could be met by the borrower using the money for a purpose {{other than the one}} for which it was lent, allowing the lender to claim an equitable interest in it. In Carreras Rothmans Ltd v Freeman Mathews Treasure Ltd, the Quistclose trust principle was said by Peter Gibson J. to be that [...] "equity fastens on <b>the</b> <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person who receives from another property transferred for a specific purpose only and not therefore for the recipient's [...] own purposes, so that such person will not be permitted to treat the property as his own or to use it for other than the stated purpose"; this reference to [...] "conscience" [...] could make Quistclose trusts constructive in nature. However, no constructive trust could be created until the money is misused, which may be too late for an effective remedy.|$|E
500|$|Pope {{suggests}} that Pullin's writing gave the debate [...] "a renewed vigour and sharp focus once again." [...] Although Pullin toned down his comments {{by the time}} the articles were published in book form, his attacks on Yorkshire County Cricket Club and general cricket administration aroused public support and led to action. Thewlis, for example, was given work as a groundsman and provided with a pension. [...] In Pullin's entry into the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Lincoln Allison notes that the book reflected Pullin's close and sympathetic relationship with the players. Allison describes it as a pioneering work: the unhappy experiences of cricketers after retirement was a phenomenon not widely known at the time. E.W. Swanton, a press box colleague {{for the last few years}} of Pullin's career, writes: [...] "It was his revelations about the straits of poverty to which some of these heroes of the past were reduced that first roused <b>the</b> <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public and the county committees, Yorkshire's not least." [...] Derek Hodgson, in the official history of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, writes that Pullin [...] "produced one of the most valuable source books on Victorian cricket".|$|E
500|$|Noam Chomsky {{has argued}} that forces {{opposing}} the development of such a world conscience include free market ideologies that valorise corporate greed in nominal electoral democracies where advertising, shopping malls and indebtedness, shape citizens into apathetic consumers in relation to information and access necessary for democratic participation. John Passmore {{has argued that}} mystical considerations about the global expansion of all human consciousness, should {{take into account that}} if as a species we do become something much superior to what we are now, it will be as a consequence of conscience not only implanting a goal of moral perfectibility, but assisting us to remain periodically anxious, passionate and discontented, for these are necessary components of care and compassion. The Committee on Conscience of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has targeted genocides such as those in Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, the Congo and Chechnya as challenges to the world's conscience. Oscar Arias Sanchez has criticised global arms industry spending as a failure of conscience by nation states: [...] "When a country decides to invest in arms, rather than in education, housing, the environment, and health services for its people, it is depriving a whole generation of its right to prosperity and happiness. We have produced one firearm for every ten inhabitants of this planet, and yet we have not bothered to end hunger when such a feat is well within our reach. This is not a necessary or inevitable state of affairs. It is a deliberate choice" [...] (see Campaign Against Arms Trade). US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, after meeting with the 14th Dalai Lama during the 2008 violent protests in Tibet and aftermath said: [...] "The situation in Tibet is a challenge to <b>the</b> <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world." [...] Nelson Mandela, through his example and words, has been described as having shaped <b>the</b> <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. [...] The Right Livelihood Award is awarded yearly in Sweden to those people, mostly strongly motivated by conscience, who have made exemplary practical contributions to resolving the great challenges facing our planet and its people. In 2009, for example, along with Catherine Hamlin (obstetric fistula and see fistula foundation)), David Suzuki (promoting awareness of climate change) and Alyn Ware (nuclear disarmament), René Ngongo shared the Right Livelihood Award [...] "for his courage in confronting the forces that are destroying the Congo Basin's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use". Avaaz {{is one of the largest}} global on-line organizations launched in January 2007 to promote conscience-driven activism on issues such as climate change, human rights, animal rights, corruption, poverty, and conflict, thus [...] "closing the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want".|$|E

500|$|The more {{assertive}} Gwen in Torchwoods third series attracted praise from reviewers: Paul Collins of Total Sci-Fi expressed {{the opinion that}} Children of Earth finally shows Gwen's heroic characteristics {{in a way that}} had been missing in the first two series, while Daniel Martin from the Guardian stated that [...] "it's great to see Gwen being so completely badass". David Cornelius wrote that Gwen succeeds as a strongly written female character that does not pander to stereotypes because writers avoid defining her by any aspect of her adventures. Reviewers commented on Myles' standing as a leading lady: Comic Book Resources Remy Minnick describes Gwen as [...] "the true heart of Torchwood", while Scott Lewinski from Wired magazine described Myles' portrayal as <b>the</b> <b>conscience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Torchwood team, and the show itself. Total Sci-Fis Jonathan Wilkins felt that the five-part serial marked the emergence of Eve Myles as a star in her own right and opined that she could potentially carry the show without co-star Barrowman. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune stated her belief that the third series' climax showed that Eve Myles has [...] "grown into the role" [...] of Gwen, describing her performance as [...] "outstanding". Ryan later gave an [...] "Honourable Mention" [...] to Gwen when discussing Sci-Fi TV's Most Memorable Female Characters, making her the only Doctor Who franchise character to receive a mention. Critical response to the character remained positive in the fourth series. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph felt Myles [...] "took the acting honours with a bravura performance", whilst Charlie Jane Anders stated Gwen to have the strongest moments in the finale which led to [...] "a new appreciation for her character".|$|E
