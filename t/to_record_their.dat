5|$|Rome's {{earliest}} history, {{from the}} time of its founding as a small tribal village, to the downfall of its kings, is the least well preserved. Although the early Romans were literate to some degree, this void {{may be due to the}} lack of will <b>to</b> <b>record</b> <b>their</b> history at that time, or such histories as they did record were lost.|$|E

Following the tour the group was invited to record a single for Sub Pop Singles Club and attempted <b>to</b> <b>record</b> <b>their</b> follow-up album The White Birch in 1992. The recording sessions proved to be disastrous for the group since it found themselves often with unusable tracks over several different studios. As Codeine could not record enough material for a full-length album, they decided to release what tracks they had as an EP.|$|E

5|$|I {{remember}} {{when they came}} to record 'Spice Up Your Life'. It {{was in the middle of}} the chaos. It had been booked in, that they were coming in <b>to</b> <b>record</b> <b>their</b> next single, and write it, with us. It was at Whitfield Street Studios and there was going to be an MTV crew there filming them as they did this, which there was. Well, how on earth can you possibly do this? You can't write and record a song in half-an-hour with a film crew watching.|$|E
5|$|In August 1990, {{the band}} {{travelled}} to Florida {{to work on}} the album.

Their label Roadrunner granted a $40,000 budget, which helped explain the album's improved production values. That allowed Igor and Burns, for example, to spend a whole week just testing the drum kit's tunings and experimenting with microphone practice.|$|E
