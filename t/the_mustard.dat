5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the Thale cress, Arabidopsis thaliana, a weedy species in <b>the</b> <b>mustard</b> family (Brassicaceae). The genome or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of DNA, forming {{one of the smallest}} genomes among flowering plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000. The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon, has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of cereals, grasses and monocots generally.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage (Brassica oleracea or B.oleracea var. capitata, var. tuba, var. sabauda or var. acephala) is {{a member}} of the genus Brassica and <b>the</b> <b>mustard</b> family, Brassicaceae. Several other cruciferous {{vegetables}} (sometimes known as cole crops) are considered cultivars of B.oleracea, including broccoli, collard greens, brussels sprouts, kohlrabi and sprouting broccoli. All of these developed from the wild cabbage B.oleracea var. oleracea, also called colewort or field cabbage. This original species evolved over thousands of years into those seen today, as selection resulted in cultivars having different characteristics, such as large heads for cabbage, large leaves for kale and thick stems with flower buds for broccoli.|$|E
5|$|Clarke {{sold the}} Stradivarius {{she had been}} bequeathed, and {{established}} the May Muklé prize at the Royal Academy. The prize is still awarded annually to an outstanding cellist. After her husband's death in 1967, Clarke began writing a memoir, entitled I Had a Father Too (or <b>the</b> <b>Mustard</b> Spoon); it was completed in 1973 but never published. In it she describes her early life, marked by frequent beatings from her father and strained family relations which affected her perceptions of her proper place in life.

5|$|On May 10, {{the twin}} villages of Gahar and Gadafa in Wadi Hirran, where Prince Mohamed bin Mohsin was in command, were gas bombed, {{killing at least}} seventy-five. The Red Cross was alerted and on June 2, it issued a {{statement}} in Geneva expressing concern. The Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University of Berne made a statement, based on a Red Cross report, that the gas was {{likely to have been}} halogenous derivatives – phosgene, mustard gas, lewisite, chlorine or cyanogen bromide. The gas attacks stopped for three weeks after the Six-Day War of June, but resumed on July, against all parts of royalist Yemen. Casualty estimates vary, and an assumption, considered conservative, is that <b>the</b> <b>mustard</b> and phosgene-filled aerial bombs caused approximately 1,500 fatalities and 1,500 injuries.|$|E

50|$|Brassicaceae or Cruciferae is a {{medium-sized}} and economically important family of flowering plants {{commonly known as}} <b>the</b> <b>mustards,</b> <b>the</b> crucifers, or the cabbage family. Most are herbaceous plants, some shrubs, with simple, although sometimes deeply incised, alternatingly set leaves without stipules or in leaf rosettes, with terminal inflorescences without bracts, containing flowers with four free sepals, four free alternating petals, two short and four longer free stamens, and a fruit with seeds in rows, divided by a thin wall (or septum).|$|R

25|$|Vegetable growers {{sometimes}} grow mustard as a green manure. Its {{main purpose}} is {{to act as a}} mulch, covering the soil to suppress weeds between crops. If grown as a green manure, <b>the</b> <b>mustard</b> plants are cut down at the base when sufficiently grown, and left to wither on the surface, continuing to act as a mulch until the next crop is due for sowing, when <b>the</b> <b>mustard</b> is dug in. In the UK, mustard sown in summer and autumn is cut down starting in October. April sowings can be cut down in June, keeping the ground clear for summer-sown crops. One of the disadvantages of using mustard as a green manure is its propensity to harbor club root.|$|E
25|$|The first books {{illustrated}} with colored woodcuts appeared around this time; as color-printing techniques were perfected, illustrated manuals {{on the art}} of painting began to be published.

25|$|In {{some places}} in India, the corpse may {{be carried out}} of the house from the side door, rather than the front door so that the {{deceased}} does not find her way back in the house. If a woman dies during childbirth or during her menstrual cycle, her “corpse is anointed with five different products of the cow and special texts are recited.” In the Hilly regions, the place where a pregnant woman died is carefully scraped and the earth removed. The spot is then sown with mustard (sarson), which is also sprinkled along the road traversed by the corpse {{on its way to the}} burial ground. The reason behind this is that <b>the</b> <b>mustard</b> blossoms in the world of the dead, and the sweet smell pleases the spirit and keeps her content, so that she does not long to revisit her earthly home; secondly, the Churel rises from her grave at nightfall and seeks to return to her friends but when she sees the minute grains of <b>the</b> <b>mustard</b> scattered abroad and stoops to pick it up, and while she is engaged, the sun rises and she is unable to visit her home. This story also tells us that the Churel usually only comes out during the night.|$|E
25|$|However, {{low income}} {{residents}} still {{make up a}} large proportion of the population (28.3% in 2001). <b>The</b> <b>Mustard</b> Seed Calgary is located in the Beltline at 102 11 Ave SE. There are also many poorly maintained and dilapidated buildings with low rents. A large portion of Victoria Park, in particular, is in poor condition due to the city's decision to restrict development on lands needed for Calgary Stampede expansion Owners of this land were generally not interested in improving buildings they knew would be removed soon. As a result, a number of seemingly abandoned buildings were occupied illegally by squatters. As the city has finalized land purchases and made final decisions on land use, this has decreased dramatically.|$|E

25|$|But {{with these}} {{potential}} hazards, Clayton and Bell consistently turned out windows {{in which the}} balance of colour is eminently satisfying to the eye. They had the happy knack of selecting exactly the right tonal values so that difficult colour combinations, (such as red and green laid side by side as the cloth and lining of a cloak) appear inevitable. Moreover, their colour choices are rarely timid. (A “safe” choice is to line every cloak with yellow {{in the form of}} an applied silver-stain.) Although most of the colours in their windows are primaries- basic red, yellow and blue with a mid-tone grassy green, they introduced judiciously placed tertiary colours such as russet, brownish purple and a sort of mustard colour. <b>The</b> <b>mustard</b> colour often appears in conjunction with a bright intense blue. They frequently clothed a central figure in a robe of this bright blue, in contrast to the dark blue of the background and the bright red of surrounding robes.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>mustard</b> Arabidopsis thaliana, {{one of the}} best-studied {{plants in}} the world, {{normally}} turns red under harsh conditions. But {{using a combination of}} natural mutations and genetic manipulation, scientists from Danish biotechnology company Aresa Biodetection, created a strain that only changes color in response to the nitrous oxide that leaks from landmines and other explosives. Because nitrous oxide can also be formed by denitrifying bacteria, there is some risk of false positives using this technique, and researchers are attempting to make the plant less sensitive. The plants would aid demining by indicating the presence of mines through color change, and could either be sown from aircraft or by people walking through demined corridors in minefields. As of February 2005, no studies have been conducted with actual landmines, though successful studies have been done in greenhouses. In order {{to prevent the spread of}} this genetically modified organism into the wild, the plants have been further modified so that they will only sprout when provided with an external growth factor.|$|E
25|$|There {{were other}} mills besides the textile mills. Between Field Mill and Town Mill, {{there was an}} iron foundry, called Meadow Foundry, which was built by William Bradshaw and John Sansom in 1852. The site had {{previously}} been occupied by a water-powered bark mill, and remained in the ownership of the Duke of Portland. In 1867, Bradshaw and Sansom negotiated a new 14-year lease with the Duke, which included the supply of water from King's Mill reservoir, but they became bankrupt during the following year. It {{was taken over by}} James Bownes, who formed a limited company to operate it, and it remained in use until 1960, when the firm moved to new premises, and the site was redeveloped by the Mansfield Brewery. Below the foundry was Borough Mills, which operated as a saw mill. Between Town Mills and Stanton Mill was the Rock Valley Mill, which was operated by Dickenson Ellis as a mustard mill in the early nineteenth century. It was taken over by David Cooper Barringer in 1839, who formed Barringer and Company to operate it. In 1873, they decided to pack <b>the</b> <b>mustard</b> in decorated tin boxes, instead of wooden ones, and made the boxes on site from pre-printed metal sheet. Soon they were making tin boxes for other companies, and the separate Rock Valley Tin Works was formed in 1889. Three years later, a printing works was established, to print the metal sheets, and it became a limited company in 1895. Following several takeovers, it remains in business as Carnaud Metal Box Engineering.|$|E
