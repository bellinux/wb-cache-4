5|$|Kepler-11d is an {{exoplanet}} {{discovered in}} the orbit of the sun-like star Kepler-11. It is named for the telescope that discovered it, a NASA spacecraft named Kepler <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> detect Earth-like planets by measuring small dips in the brightness of their host stars as the planets cross in front. This process, known as the transit method, was used to note the presence of six planets in orbit around Kepler-11, of which Kepler-11d is the third from its star. Kepler-11d orbits Kepler-11 well within the orbit of Mercury approximately every 23 days. The planet is approximately six times more massive than the Earth, and has a radius that is {{three and a half}} times larger than that of Earth's. It is, however, far hotter than Earth is. Its low density, comparable to that of Saturn, suggests that Kepler-11d has a large hydrogen–helium atmosphere. Kepler-11d was announced with its five sister planets on February 2, 2011 after extensive follow-up studies.|$|E

Blank distinguished between two Start-ups: a) early stage start-ups <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> search for product/market fit under conditions of extreme uncertainty. B) late stage start-ups <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> search for a repeatable and scalable business model and then scale into large companies <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> execute under conditions of high certainty.’ As explained later on, we focus particularly on science-based technology start-ups that build their business around a new technology or invention with the aim to commercialize it.|$|R
