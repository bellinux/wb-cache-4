5|$|At the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the honours {{were removed}} from Kinneff Church and {{returned}} to the king. Ogilvie quarrelled with Marischal's mother over who would <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for saving the honours, though he was eventually rewarded with a baronetcy. Fletcher was awarded 2,000 merks by Parliament but the sum was never paid.|$|E

5|$|After {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Shakespeare Gallery, many wanted to <b>take</b> <b>credit.</b> Henry Fuseli long claimed that his planned Shakespeare ceiling (in {{imitation}} of the Sistine Chapel ceiling) had given Boydell {{the idea for the}} gallery. James Northcote claimed that his Death of Wat Tyler and Murder of the Princes in the Tower had motivated Boydell to start the project. However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably Joshua Reynolds's Royal Academy lectures on the superiority of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.|$|E

5|$|Both sides {{declared}} victory. On {{a tactical}} level, the battle went in Israel's favor, and {{the aim of}} destroying the Karameh camp was achieved. On the other hand, the relatively high casualties sustained came as a considerable surprise for the Israelis. Israel failed to retrieve three dead soldiers, who were left behind in Karameh along with several damaged Israeli vehicles and tanks—later paraded in Amman by the Jordanians. The engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian fighters. Although the Palestinians had limited success in inflicting Israeli casualties, King Hussein allowed them to <b>take</b> <b>credit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{has often}} been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural {{disaster}} to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed {{a lack of interest}} in federal flood control. Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, {{and that it would be}} seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.|$|E
5|$|After the ISIS agents reunite and Drake's mutinous crew {{agrees to}} {{surrender}} {{in order to}} prevent his death, Drake has a mental breakdown, declaring humanity to be doomed and killing himself with Pam's rifle. Cyril, startled by the sudden gunfire, opens fire himself, killing three people (one of whom was the only capable pilot of the shuttle other than Drake). To worsen the situation, Barry Dylan (Dave Willis) challenges Archer to fight him in space. Despite the rigorous taunting and demeaning from Barry, Archer ultimately declines his offer. After Archer makes an act of humility, Cyril aims the launches at Barry's jet, subsequently stranding him on Horizon. As the group nears the airstrip, Archer, who wishes to <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for the landing, messes with the steering shift, causing the spacecraft to crash. Afterwards, every ISIS agent except for Archer is shown to be injured as a result, especially Ray, who is now paralyzed from the waist down (which he ironically had pretended to be earlier in the season).|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to persistent PLO raids against Israeli civilian targets, Israel attacked {{the town of}} Karameh, Jordan, {{the site of a}} major PLO camp. The goal of the invasion was to destroy Karameh camp and capture Yasser Arafat in reprisal for the attacks by the PLO against Israeli civilians, which culminated in an Israeli school bus hitting a mine in the Negev, killing two children. However, plans for the two operations were prepared in 1967, one year before the bus attack. When Jordan saw the size of the raiding forces entering the battle it was led to the assumption that Israel had another goal of capturing Balqa Governorate to create a Golan Heights similar situation. Israel assumed that the Jordanian Army would ignore the invasion, but the latter fought alongside the Palestinians and opened heavy fire that inflicted losses upon the Israeli forces. This engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian forces. The Israelis were repelled {{at the end of a}} day's battle, having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken around 141 PLO prisoners. Both sides declared victory. On a tactical level, the battle went in Israel's favor and the destruction of the Karameh camp was achieved. However, the relatively high casualties were a considerable surprise for the Israel Defense Forces and was stunning to the Israelis. Although the Palestinians were not victorious on their own, King Hussein let the Palestinians <b>take</b> <b>credit.</b> Some have alleged that Arafat himself was on the battlefield, but the details of his involvement are unclear. However, his allies–as well as Israeli intelligence–confirm that he urged his men throughout the battle to hold their ground and continue fighting.|$|E
25|$|SDS {{had opposed}} {{the call for}} mass demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. The group felt that mass demonstrations and electoral {{politics}} were not effective {{as a means of}} influencing national policy. But when the demonstrations proved popular and provoked a heavy-handed police response (as SDS predicted), the organization moved quickly to <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for the protests.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{political}} {{figures in the}} ancient Near East liked to <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for public works. Temples, buildings and statues built by a ruler {{are likely to have}} some sort of inscription mentioning his name. The kings also were sure to record major deeds like battles won, titles acquired, or gods appeased in some form of public inscription. These are very useful in tracking the reign of a ruler.|$|E

25|$|Sōjirō first {{appears in}} the storyline when he uses his superhuman speed to reach and assassinate {{government}} official Ōkubo Toshimichi, also killing the official's would-be samurai assassins who would historically <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for Ōkubo's death nonetheless. Later, after Senkaku's defeat, Sōjirō duels with Kenshin using Battōjutsu with the fight ending in a tie when their swords shattered. Sōjirō is then assigned by Shishio to gather the Jupongatana located in {{the east side of}} Japan.|$|E
25|$|Sir Alan and his {{advisers}} pointed out that selling the extras {{played a crucial role}} in deciding who won and criticised Velocity for not realising this, though Ruth was given much praise for her sales. Meanwhile, there was some confusion about who had made three of Velocity's sales, with Ruth and Samuel both trying to <b>take</b> <b>credit.</b> In the end, Sir Alan decided that Ruth deserved sole credit, leaving Samuel without a sale to his name.|$|E

Rogers attended Brydon Country School and played in their 1st Eleven as an allrounder along with Sean Ervine. His secondary education was at St. John's College where he was captain of the first eleven.|$|E

25|$|Many of our {{important}} source documents, {{such as the}} Assyrian King List, are the products of government and religious establishments. They often have a built-in slant {{in favor of the}} king or god in charge. A king may even <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for a battle or construction project of an earlier ruler. The Assyrians in particular have a literary tradition of always putting the best possible face on history. The tablets or inscriptions in question still have value, though one does have to keep the slant in mind.|$|E
25|$|After the Red Skull's actions cause all {{heroes and}} villains present at his defeat {{to undergo a}} 'moral inversion', Alex {{attempts}} to argue for Janet's life as the X-Men prepare to detonate a gene bomb that will destroy all non-mutants in the blast radius, but accepts the decision nevertheless. After Carnage sacrifices himself to contain the blast, Alex attempts to <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for it, but Janet sees through the deception. Although the inversion is undone, the two separate for good when Alex {{is one of three}} characters (the other two being Iron Man and Sabretooth) to remain in their new state.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{dispute over}} how much direct {{operational}} control Haig maintained at this time, Tim Travers in particular arguing that he allowed his Army Commanders (Plumer, Byng, Horne, Birdwood and Rawlinson) a very free hand, whilst {{at the same time}} Ferdinand Foch, whose role had initially been confined to advice and deployment of reserves, was exerting ever-greater influence over strategy. Haig was irritated that Foch insisted that Plumer's Second Army remain part of an Army Group commanded by the King of the Belgians, so that the French and Belgians could <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for liberating Brussels.|$|E

25|$|Samir Kuntar {{spent nearly}} three decades in prison before being {{released}} on July 16, 2008 {{as part of an}} Israel-Hezbollah prisoner swap. He denied killing Danny and Einat (the child and her father), but admitted to killing Eliyahu Shachar, the policeman. He never expressed remorse for the killings. In Israel, Kuntar was considered the perpetrator {{of one of the most}} brutal terrorist attacks in the country's history, while in Lebanon he was widely regarded as a national hero. He was assassinated on December 19, 2015, in a suspected Israeli airstrike, though Israel did not confirm this and the Free Syrian Army would later <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for killing Kuntar.|$|E
25|$|While Jolson was touring with a stage show during June 1927, {{production}} on The Jazz Singer {{began with the}} shooting of exterior scenes by the second unit. In late June, Alan Crosland headed to New York City to shoot the Lower East Side and Winter Garden exteriors on location. Jolson joined the production in mid-July (his contract specified July 11). Filming with Jolson began with his silent scenes; the more complex Vitaphone sequences were primarily done in late August. Both Jolson and Zanuck would later <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> for thinking up the ad-libbed dialogue sequence between Jack and his mother; another story had it that Sam Warner was impressed by Jolson's brief ad-libbing in the cabaret scene and had Cohn {{come up with some}} lines on the spot. On September 23, Motion Picture News reported that {{production on}} the film had been completed.|$|E
25|$|Japp is a Scotland Yard Inspector {{and appears}} {{in many of}} the stories trying to solve cases that Poirot is working on. Japp is outgoing, loud and {{sometimes}} inconsiderate by nature and his relationship with the refined Belgian is one of the stranger aspects of Poirot’s world. He first met Poirot in Belgium in 1904, during the Abercrombie Forgery. Later that year they joined forces again to hunt down a criminal known as Baron Altara. They also meet in England where Poirot often helps Japp and lets him <b>take</b> <b>credit</b> in return for special favours. These favours usually entail Poirot being supplied with other interesting cases. In Agatha Christie's Poirot, Japp was portrayed by Philip Jackson. In the film, Thirteen at Dinner (1985), adapted from Lord Edgware Dies, the role of Japp was taken by the actor David Suchet, who would later star as Poirot in the ITV adaptations.|$|E
