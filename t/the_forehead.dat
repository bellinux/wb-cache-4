5|$|Hair {{length is}} most often {{measured}} (in centimeters or inches) from {{the line of the}} scalp on <b>the</b> <b>forehead</b> up over the highest point of the skull to its termination, and sometimes from the crown, the latter resulting in 10 centimeter lower values in average. In cosmetology, hair lengths are usually categorized according to the part of the body where the bulk of the longest hair terminates: chin level, shoulder length, lower shoulderblade/mid-back level, waist length, hip-length, classic length (extends to almost buttock-length, i.e. upper thigh-length, where the legs meet the buttocks), thigh-length, knee-length and ankle/floor length hair.|$|E

5|$|Of the subspecies, the black-faced impala is {{significantly}} larger and {{darker than the}} common impala; melanism {{is responsible for the}} black colouration. Distinctive of the black-faced impala is a dark stripe, {{on either side of the}} nose, that runs upward to the eyes and thins as it reaches <b>the</b> <b>forehead.</b> Other differences include the larger black tip on the ear, and a bushier and nearly 30% longer tail in the black-faced impala.|$|E

Tulsidas was so charmed that he forgot about the sandalwood. Rama took the sandalwood paste and put a Tilaka himself on his forehead and Tulsidas' forehead before disappearing.|$|E
5|$|Sacred zebu {{were kept}} in a sunken cattle pen (fahimasina) {{to the west of}} the kianja {{courtyard}} before sacrifice at royal events such as circumcisions and the fandroana festival. Only the two most highly prized types of zebu were kept here: black zebu with white markings on <b>the</b> <b>forehead,</b> called volavita, and entirely reddish-brown zebu, called malaza. In this way, the cattle were made to walk from the west toward the east (the direction of the ancestors and sanctity) before being slaughtered. Another large pen for sacrificial zebu was located to the northeast of this courtyard before being filled in by the French Colonial Authority in the late 19th century.|$|E

5|$|The area {{above the}} eyes, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>forehead,</b> crown and nape, {{is a deep}} blue-black, through {{the top edge of}} the mantle. The mantle proper is a medium to dark gray-blue as are the tertials and upperwing-coverts, turning to a dark gray at the median, greater and primary coverts and the alula. The secondaries and inner primaries are fringed in gray-blue. The central rectrices are gray-blue, and the outer rectrices are a blackish-gray, paling towards the tips.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>forehead,</b> lores, crown, mantle, and {{scapular}} {{area are}} a neutral grey colour. There is a brown {{spot on the}} nape.

Its lower belly and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and {{the bottom of their}} breasts are mixed with a pale buff colour.

5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. <b>The</b> <b>forehead</b> patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and mixes with the white of the face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. <b>The</b> <b>forehead</b> is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hixon was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the use of electromagnetic principles to measure articulation. In his letter to the editor, published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, he described a setup using two sensor coils and one generator coil. The sensor coils, attached to <b>the</b> <b>forehead</b> and back of the neck, would remain stationary while the generator coil, attached to the jaw, would move creating variable currents in the sensor coils. These currents could then be used to determine the distance in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} small swallow, the nominate subspecies has bronze upperparts and bronze {{sides of the}} head. The ears and lores are duller and <b>the</b> <b>forehead</b> area is more green than bronze. The shoulders, back, rump, and uppertail-coverts are, on the other hand, a coppery-bronze colour. The lesser and median coverts are more coppery, with the greater and primary-wing-coverts being more of a dusky green. The primaries, secondaries, and tail are a dusky bronze-green. The underparts are mostly white. The legs, feet, and irides are dark brown, and the bill is black. The female is similar but with a mottled grey-brown breast and occasionally throat and undertail-coverts. The juvenile is also mottled-grey brown, in addition to it being duller overall. The extant subspecies, T. e. sclateri, is primarily differentiated by its more deeply forked tail, blue-green forehead and uppertail-coverts, and blue-black wings and tail.|$|E
50|$|Four {{types of}} flap design are {{historically}} described in literature: <b>the</b> median <b>forehead</b> flap, oblique forehead flap, sickle flap and vertical paramedian <b>forehead</b> flap. However, <b>the</b> vertical paramedian <b>forehead</b> flap {{based on the}} ipsilateral or contralateral supratrochlear vessels has become standard, {{because it has a}} low turning point, making it easy to reach the defect without using hair-bearing scalp. Also, primary closing of <b>the</b> proximal <b>forehead</b> is possible {{as a result of the}} narrow pedicle.|$|R
