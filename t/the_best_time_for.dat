5|$|<b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> {{whitewater}} boating on Loyalsock Creek at Worlds End State Park is from March to May, and {{the park}} hosts a slalom race on Loyalsock Creek each spring. The whitewater gradient is 41 for {{the section of the}} creek in and near the park, and its rating on the International Scale of River Difficulty is II to III+, with sections reaching IV. The water is too swift for open canoes, so visitors are asked to use kayaks. The swimming area is closed to whitewater boating during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|The birds breed {{easily in}} captivity and can lay eggs every 3 weeks between February and November. Once the female has one egg in her nest, {{she will not}} lay another. An egg takes about 30 days to hatch. The eyes of the young open around 3 weeks and the yellow down will show black pin {{feathers}} at about 6 weeks. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> hand raising is at about 10 weeks when their black feathers are in place but the tail feathers are still short. Young birds fledge after about 4 months and both sexes have the colouring of their mother. Mature male birds will become aggressive to young male birds at puberty (4 years); they must be separated if caged.|$|E
5|$|Adam Williams (James Nesbitt) {{breaks up}} with another {{in a long line}} of girlfriends and spends the evening at the pub with his friend Pete Gifford (John Thomson). Pete arrives home late, which annoys his wife Jenny (Fay Ripley), who {{calculated}} that night to be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> them to conceive a child. She becomes even more frustrated when she sees Pete has brought Adam back; he missed his last bus home. Rachel Bradley's (Helen Baxendale) boyfriend Simon Atkinson (Stephen Mapes) breaks up with her over dinner after taking a job in Hong Kong. Rachel angrily leaves the restaurant and telephones her friend Karen Marsden (Hermione Norris), who has just asked her husband David (Robert Bathurst) if they can get a nanny to take care of their son Josh.|$|E

50|$|Both the {{marathon}} and the half marathon attract elite level competitors. The marathon course records {{are held by}} David Kemboi (2:07:53 hours) and Alla Zhilyaeva (2:27:38 hours). <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> half marathon are by Dieudonné Disi (1:01:13) and Christelle Daunay (1:08:34).|$|R

Late fall to early summer are <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> sightings, but some remain year round.|$|R
5|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament adds new modes: Leagues, Time Trials, Single Race, and Tournaments. In League mode, players {{compete for}} points in divisions. Seasons consist of four races. Players {{with the most}} points {{at the end of}} the season are {{promoted}} to the next division, and players with the least are relegated. Time Trial mode is where players race alone (although some tracks have a Shadow Racer representing <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>time)</b> <b>for</b> the best time, or to practise driving. Single Race is where players compete in a series of rounds in which vehicles begin at the centre of the scree, and get further apart as the race progresses. If a vehicle goes off the screen, they are out of the race unless they have travelled the furthest. The game ends when only one player remains. Tournaments are a fixed race series played in the same manner as Single Races. The winner is the first player to win a set number of times. There are two multiplayer-only modes: Knockout and Share Games. Knockout involves a series of races similar to tournament mode, with winners progressing to the next round and losers knocked out. Share Games is similar to Single Race, but cars are coloured according to team, with each team's finishing position depending on which member performs the best. The Mega Drive J-Cart provides two controller ports, enabling up to eight players in multiplayer by two players sharing the controllers. The Game Gear version retains the console sharing (two player sharing one console) function of the original, and two units can be linked.|$|E
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} is {{open all}} year from 6am to 5pm. The best weather at the sanctuary is during November and December when {{the area is}} cooled by the Northeast monsoon and the grasslands are the most luxuriant. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> bird watching is from October to January and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> animal viewing is from March to August.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> {{visiting the}} city is in late spring — late April and May, and early in autumn: September, October, when the city's trees turn yellow. Other times are mainly dry with a few showers.|$|E
50|$|Public {{holidays}} and weekends {{during the summer}} months were <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sumner line when the residents of Christchurch sought respite from city life with a day out at the seaside town of Sumner. Almost all services on the Sumner line were steam-hauled though occasionally horses were used for special services.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> {{trekking}} are {{in spring}} (March and April) and autumn (October and November), when {{the visibility of}} the mountain is ideal and the temperature is not excessively cold.However, in autumn the competition for bed spaces in the lodges can be intense, though normally trekkers are allowed {{to sleep on the}} floor of the dining room lodge.|$|R
25|$|The {{evolution}} {{towards the}} net/node addressing scheme was also useful for reducing communications costs between continents, where timezone differences on {{either end of}} the connection might also come into play. For instance, the best time to forward mail in the US was at night, but that might not be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> European hosts to exchange. Efforts towards introducing a continental level to the addressing system started in 1986.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the 100m set during Olympic {{competition}} {{is known as}} the Olympic record. To count as an official record, the race and the equipment used must adhere to IAAF international rules. Hand-timed results were the standard until 1975, when fully automatic timing (FAT) became the preferred method for officially measuring athletes' times. Further to this wind conditions must be measured and any time achieved with a wind speed of over 2.0 metres per second in a direction behind the athlete is treated as wind-assisted and cannot be taken for an Olympic record mark.|$|E
25|$|Port Phillip lies in {{southern}} Victoria, separated from Bass Strait by the Bellarine Peninsula {{to the southwest}} and Mornington Peninsula to the southeast. It is the largest bay in Victoria {{and one of the}} largest inland bays in Australia. The narrow entrance to the bay, called the Rip, between Point Lonsdale and Point Nepean, features strong tidal streams made turbulent by the uneven contours of the seabed. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> small craft to enter the Rip is at slack water. Large ships require expert local guidance to enter and exit, provided by the Port Phillip Sea Pilots. Work has commenced to deepen the channel entrance, to allow newer, larger container ships to access Melbourne's docks.|$|E
50|$|One source {{reports that}} Quartz Mountain {{climbing}} is very strenuous {{and that this}} mountain is not recommended for beginners. It {{has been compared to}} climbing at Joshua Tree National Park. Most of the climbing is done on the south face of the mountain, so summer is not a recommended <b>time</b> <b>for</b> climbing. Spring and fall are <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> this activity.|$|R
50|$|The 1990s {{were not}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Russian cinema {{in general and}} most of the {{released}} movies were mediocre and low-grade. During this period, many actors were forced to star in low-quality films just to make ends meet, and Leonid Kuravlyov was not an exception. Perhaps, his role in a movie called Baryshnya-krestyanka (Lady Into Lassie, 1995) is the only one worth mentioning.|$|R

25|$|He {{ordered the}} {{building}} of the New Town (Nové Město) adjacent to the Old Town and laid out the design himself. The Charles Bridge, replacing the Judith Bridge destroyed in the flood just prior to his reign, was erected to connect the east bank districts to the Malá Strana and castle area. On 9 July 1357 at 5:31am, Charles IV personally laid the first foundation stone for the Charles Bridge. The exact time of laying the first foundation stone is known because the palindromic number 135797531 was carved into the Old Town bridge tower having been chosen by the royal astrologists and numerologists as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> starting the bridge construction. In 1347, he founded Charles University, which remains the oldest university in Central Europe.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about his}} pass on Räikkönen {{in the closing}} laps, Massa said that [...] "it was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> me in the race, I was quite strong and then I caught him and I passed him." [...] Since the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix, where Barrichello ceded the lead to Michael Schumacher, team orders have been banned in Formula One. Räikkönen {{appeared}} unbothered when asked about Massa's pass: [...] "I mean {{we know what we}} want as a team and that's what we did it. It is normal in these situations." [...] No investigation was undertaken by the stewards at the race. GrandPrix.com played down the incident, saying [...] "Anyone who understands racing understood {{what was going on and}} only the silly people objected." ...|$|E
500|$|... "One Last Time" [...] {{was written}} by the songwriting team Savan Kotecha, Rami Yacoub and Carl Falk, with Dutch {{producer}} Giorgio Tuinfort and French DJ David Guetta. Kotecha had already previously collaborated with Grande when producing the first, second, third and fourth single from My Everything. Guetta was working on his album Listen, and while making the album he chose to give [...] "One Last Time" [...] to Grande, since [...] " [...] had like 120 songs and [...] trying to make an album that ma sense {{because some of the}} songs can be great, but that doesn’t mean that they would fit together.

[...] "One Last Time" [...] was strongly considered to be My Everythings lead-single, according to Republic Records' executive vice president Charlie Walk, however [...] "Problem" [...] was chosen instead, being the song that best [...] "set the tone for the project." [...] Later, [...] ""Break Free" [...] felt like summer," [...] Walk claimed, while [...] "Bang Bang" [...] helped usher in Jessie J's album Sweet Talker, and [...] "fall/winter felt like <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> [...] "Love Me Harder", since it's a heavier, darker record," [...] he added.|$|E
50|$|He is {{the current}} Japanese record holder for the mile run, with a {{personal}} best of 3:58.89 minutes. His time, set on 11 May 1996, made him the second Japanese man to run a sub-four-minute mile, after Takashi Ishii, who had done so nearly twenty years earlier in 1977. Shibata's 1500 metres best of 3:39.45 minutes is also among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> event by a Japanese, behind Fumikazu Kobayashi and Ishii.|$|R
50|$|The {{intervening}} terrain between Edinburgh and Glasgow, served {{largely by}} the former Monkland Railways lines, but also by several mineral branches of the E&GR main line, was mostly given over to coal and iron pits, and ironworks. While some extensions were constructed to serve new or expanded pits, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> industries in the area had gone, and decline over several decades set in.

5000|$|World {{records were}} not officially {{recognized}} by the IAAF until 1 January 2004; previously, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> marathon were {{referred to as the}} 'world best'. Courses must conform to IAAF standards for a record to be recognized. However, marathon routes still vary greatly in elevation, course, and surface, making exact comparisons impossible. Typically, the fastest times are set over relatively flat courses near sea level, during good weather conditions and with the assistance of pacesetters.|$|R

Ion Izagirre moved the best time nearer the 20-minute mark as he took another eleven seconds off the best time, before his time was usurped by Michele Scarponi, as the [...] rider put in a solid performance and went top on 20' 19". The first of four sub 20-minute times was recorded by the 's Nairo Quintana, setting a time of 19' 43", holding his pace all the way up the climb.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Race Time Trial" [...] is a single-player mode {{where the}} player {{attempts}} {{to set the}} best time {{on any of the}} tracks in the game. There are no other racers to hinder the player, but no item-bearing crates are present to aid the player. When the three-lap race is finished, the player can save a [...] "ghost", a replay of that race. The next time that track is accessed in this mode, the player can load the ghost, allowing the player or others to compete with the ghost in a race. If the player finishes each of the tracks in a set time, the player will be able to compete against the ghosts of the game's boss characters. The [...] "Lap Time Trial" [...] plays like the Race Time Trial except that the player races to get <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a single lap around the track. When one lap is finished, the player's [...] "ghost" [...] (a replay of the lap that was just completed) will appear. Whenever a better time on the lap is accomplished, the old ghost will be replaced by the faster one. In the [...] "Quick Race", the player selects a character, a track and races.
