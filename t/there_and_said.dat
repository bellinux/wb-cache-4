500|$|Hepburn's final {{appearance}} in a theatrically released film, {{and her first}} since Grace Quigley ten years earlier, was Love Affair (1994). At 87 years old, she played a supporting role alongside Annette Bening and Warren Beatty. It was the only film of Hepburn's career, other than the cameo {{appearance in}} Stage Door Canteen, in which she did not play a leading role. Roger Ebert noted {{that it was the}} first time she had looked frail, but that the [...] "magnificent spirit" [...] was still <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> her scenes [...] "steal the show". The New York Times made similar observations as they reflected on the actress's final big-screen appearance, stating that [...] "if she moved more slowly than before, in demeanor she was as game and modern as she had ever been". Hepburn filmed one final role in the television movie One Christmas (1994), for which she received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination at 87 years old.|$|E

He complements [...] the staff <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> they just decided to go another direction, {{and there are no}} hard feelings. His latest ratings were great. Grease vows to find a new place to shriek sooner or later, and is planning to enjoy the rest of his summer and hopes to be back in action soon!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The American {{reaction}} {{was that they}} would not apply any undue pressure on Israel to quit Lebanon as the Israeli presence in Lebanon may prove to be a catalyst for the disparate groups of Lebanon to make common cause against both Syrian and Israeli forces. Haig's analysis, which Ronald Reagan agreed with, was that this uniting of Lebanese groups would allow President Elias Sarkis to reform the Lebanese central Government and give the Palestinian refugees Lebanese citizenship. Additional evidence that the United States approved the Israeli invasion comes from longtime CIA analyst Charles Cogan, who says {{that he was in the}} room during a May 1982 meeting in The Pentagon during which Sharon explained to Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger [...] "in great detail how the Israelis were going to invade Lebanon... Weinberger just sat <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> nothing." ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{handed him}} a card. He took it, read it, looked at the back {{to see if there}} was {{anything}} written <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>said,</b> dubiously, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{doctors say}} Nice {{will not do}} after such an illness as this. Papa asked the doctor <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>said</b> he could not advise it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I copied {{it from an}} old one in the Boston Art Museum. Augusta saw it <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> she wouldn't {{be happy}} until she had one like it. But don't tell her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he said {{he should}} like it of all things. Papa was <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> it was not too far for him--besides, there's the donkey. Papa says it, so we must go, Miss Winter." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the movie}} The Prophecy, the Archangel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) asks Thomas Dagget, [...] "Do {{you know how}} you got that dent in your top lip? Way back, before you were born, I told you a secret, then I put my finger <b>there</b> <b>and</b> I <b>said</b> 'Shhhhh!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Schomberg, {{raising his}} eyes, at last met the gleams in two dark caverns under Mr. Jones's devilish eyebrows, {{directed}} upon him impenetrably. He shuddered as if horrors worse than murder had been lurking <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> nodding towards Ricardo: ...|$|E
6000|$|Next morning Mr. Lind rose {{before his}} {{daughter}} was astir, and went to his club, where he breakfasted. He {{then went to the}} offices in Queen Victoria Street. Finding the board-room unoccupied, he sat down <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to one of the clerks: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{still it}} would be just the same as if you stood <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "G'way, Taffy, or you'll get fever." [...] All that in a carp-fish-tail and a round egg! O Daddy, we must tell Mummy, quick!' and Taffy danced all round him.|$|E

6000|$|While Mr. Irwine was speaking, {{the sound}} of a booted step and the clink of a spur were heard on the stone floor of the entrance-hall, and Joshua Rann moved hastily aside from the doorway to make room for some one who paused <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> in a ringing tenor voice, ...|$|E
6000|$|Caleb sat a {{few minutes}} more at the door, {{and then he went}} into the house, and got his little rocking chair, and brought it out under the elm, and sat down there, looking towards the boys, who were at work near the water. At last, David spied him sitting <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|This matter {{warmed up}} into a quarrel; then into a fight; and each man got pretty badly battered. As soon as I had got myself mended up after a fashion, I ascended to the {{hurricane}} deck in a pretty sour humor. I found Captain McCord <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> as pleasantly as my humor would permit-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rupert and I {{had noticed}} for some days a woman looking at us, and she met me this {{afternoon}} <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{she had some}} thing of extreme importance to tell me. I went with her {{and she told me}} the story, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that I was her son and not yours. I asked her how she knew me from Rupert, <b>and</b> she <b>said</b> that one of us had a small mole on the shoulder. I knew that Rupert had a tiny mole <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> she <b>said</b> that that was the mark by which she knew your son from hers.|$|R
6000|$|On {{the sand}} before this {{spectacle}} I {{talked with a}} philosopher of humble condition who backed upon me and knocked my umbrella out of my hand. This made us beg each other's pardon; {{he said that he}} did not know I was <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> I <b>said</b> it did not matter. Then we both looked at the bathing, and he said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis {{well for}} 'ee to stand <b>there</b> <b>and</b> glane!" [...] <b>said</b> Arabella. [...] "Owing to your being late {{the meat is}} blooded and half spoiled! 'Twon't fetch so much by a {{shilling}} a score!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I pitched my day's leazings in Crimmercrock Lane, To tie up my garter and jog on again, When a dear dark-eyed gentleman passed <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> In a {{way that}} made all o' me colour rose-red, [...] "What do I see - [...] O pretty knee!" [...] And he came and he tied up my garter for me.|$|E
60|$|Now Mercy {{began to}} be very impatient, for each minute was as long to her as an hour; {{wherefore}} she prevented Christiana from a fuller interceding for her, by knocking at the gate herself. And she knocked then so loud, that she made Christiana to start. Then said the Keeper of the gate, Who is <b>there?</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> Christiana, It is my friend.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Alack! she is woefully ill {{when the}} fever takes her, {{and she is}} wasted away so that you would scarce know her; {{but this is one}} of the better days, and if you, sir, will come into the parlour, she will see you. She was {{arraying}} herself as I came down. She was neither to have nor to hold when she heard you were <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> a north country face would be better to her than all the Sisters' potions!' ...|$|E
50|$|A {{tradition}} {{written by}} Te Hukahuka on 25 October 1847 states that Kupe found no {{people on this}} island when he came. He returned and met Turi, {{and told him that}} all he had seen was 'a flock of spirits' (apu aparoa), and two birds: a fantail and a k≈çkako. Turi said let us go back <b>there</b> <b>and</b> Kupe <b>said</b> 'Kupe returns' <b>and</b> returned to Hawaiki.|$|R
5000|$|Other gentlemen commented {{upon the}} Haymarket, {{describing}} {{it as an}} unsafe place to go. Justice Kelnynge and Mr. Perrin stated {{it was a place}} [...] "impossible to walk up ... in the evening" [...] because of the indecent women you could find <b>there</b> <b>and</b> Kelnynge <b>said</b> that a similar episode happened to him as well before. Major Alderton added that around the Haymarket aggressions happened frequently.|$|R
6000|$|... "Reading was horrid," [...] Elvira <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> {{certainly}} hers {{deserved the}} epithet. Her attainments fell far behind those of Essie and Ellie, {{and she did}} not mean to improve them. Her hostess let her alone till she had twice shaken her rich mane at her grandfather, and refused to return with him; and he had shown himself deeply grateful to Mrs. Brownlow for keeping her <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> had <b>said</b> he hoped she was good at her lessons.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Elmore," [...] {{began her}} husband; but he arrested himself <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Very well. I {{want to know}} what I am to do. I want your full and {{explicit}} authority before I act. We will dismiss the fact of irregularity. We will suppose that it is fit and becoming for a gentleman who has twice met a young lady by accident--or once by accident, and once by his own insistence--to write to her. Do you wish to continue the correspondence?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{are moments}} in a chappie's life, don't you know, when Reason, so to speak, totters, as it were, on its bally throne. This {{was one of}} them. The {{situation}} seemed somehow to have got out of my grip. I suppose, strictly speaking, I ought, at this juncture, to have cleared my throat and said in an audible tone, [...] "Harold, old top, I know where Ponsonby is." [...] But somehow I couldn't. Something seemed to keep the words back. I just stood <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> nothing.|$|E
60|$|This was a cunning, {{though a}} {{dangerous}} step, and it succeeded accordingly, for it amused the creature entirely, and she presently concluded that really I {{could not be}} there then, otherwise {{she would never have}} asked her to lie in the house; so she grew cold again presently as to her lodging <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> No, since it was so, she would go back that afternoon, but she would come again in two or three days, and search that and all the towns round in an effectual manner, if she stayed a week or two to do it; for, in short, if I was in England or Holland she would find me.|$|E
5000|$|Elsewhere, Walker {{said the}} {{establishment}} {{was very small}} and run by a Yugoslavian family. [...] "It had the reputation that when Nureyev was in Sydney, he would always have his coffee at Sweethearts and stuff like that. There was a beautiful middle-aged woman who used to serve coffee <b>there</b> <b>and</b> never <b>said</b> anything <b>and</b> she was reputed to be the girlfriend of quite a dangerous guy," [...] he claimed.|$|R
6000|$|Mamma and papa have {{returned}} from Onteora {{and they have}} had a [...] delightful visit. Mr. Frank Stockton was down in Virginia and could [...] not reach Onteora in time, so they did not see him, and Mrs. Mary [...] Mapes Dodge was ill and couldn't go to Onteora, but Mrs. General [...] Custer was <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> mamma <b>said</b> that she was a very attractive, [...] sweet appearing woman.|$|R
6000|$|And, above all, Lady Temple {{regretted the}} loss of the cheery {{companion}} of her evenings. True, Bessie had lately had a good many small evening gaieties, but she always came back from them so fresh and bright, and so full of entertaining description and anecdote, that Fanny felt {{as if she had been}} <b>there</b> herself, <b>and,</b> <b>said</b> Bessie, [...] "it was much better for her than staying at home with her, and bringing in no novelty." ...|$|R
