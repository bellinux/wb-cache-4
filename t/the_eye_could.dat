Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E

25|$|Plato first {{articulated}} the emission theory, {{the idea that}} visual perception is accomplished by rays emitted by the eyes. He also commented on the parity reversal of mirrors in Timaeus. Some hundred years later, Euclid wrote a treatise entitled Optics where he linked vision to geometry, creating geometrical optics. He based his work on Plato's emission theory wherein he described the mathematical rules of perspective and described the effects of refraction qualitatively, although he questioned that {{a beam of light}} from <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> instantaneously light up the stars every time someone blinked. Ptolemy, in his treatise Optics, held an extramission-intromission theory of vision: the rays (or flux) from the eye formed a cone, the vertex being within the eye, and the base defining the visual field. The rays were sensitive, and conveyed information back to the observer’s intellect about the distance and orientation of surfaces. He summarised much of Euclid and went on to describe a way to measure the angle of refraction, though he failed to notice the empirical relationship between it and the angle of incidence.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{provide a}} {{numerical}} {{comparison of the}} efficiency of spherical aberration (SA) compensa-tion methods commonly used in commercial asphe-ric intraocular lenses (IOLs). Methods: Numerical simulations were performed us-ing the wavefront data of 139 right eyes implanted with a spherical Morcher 89 A (“Bag-in-the-Lens”) IOL. Simulations were done for spherical, constant aspherical and SA-free IOLs, {{as well as for}} the cus-tomized selection method. Results: Constant aspherical IOLs bought 49. 6 % of <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> to a targeted postoperative SA value ± 0. 05 µm, while zero-SA IOLs brought 61. 2 % of <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> to this range. However with customized se-lection 95 % of <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>could</b> be brought to this tar-get, resulting in more control over the postoperative spherical aberration. If no aspherical correction was used, only 8. 6 % of <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>could</b> reach <b>the</b> set target. Conclusion: These numerical results suggest that IOLs with an asphericity as a function of IOL power, supplemented by a customized selection from a num-ber of fixed SA values according to preoperative cor-neal SA, may provide sufficient control over the post-operative SA. Given the surgeon centration possibi-lity of the Bag-in-the-Lens IOL used in this study, as well as its centration stability, this is an ideal lens to implement the customized selection method.

The freighter SS Waimarama, which was transporting fuel in drums on her upper deck, suffered a direct hit by a stick of bombs, blowing up in an inferno which engulfed surrounding ships and survivors alike. The flames blazed hundreds of feet in the air, and the Mediterranean was aflame [...] "as far as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> see". As Italian aircraft dropped circling torpedoes into the water, Hill led the Ledbury into the surrounding inferno, where the destroyer's complement went over the ship's side with ropes to pick up survivors from the explosion.

2500|$|In July, {{continuing}} {{south in}} clear weather, Barkley found {{the entrance to}} the Strait of Juan de Fuca. He did not explore it, but gave it its present name honouring Juan de Fuca. Juan de Fuca claimed to have discovered and sailed up a large strait at this location in 1592. Barkley thought the strait he found matched the description Juan de Fuca had given and that it was in fact Juan de Fuca's strait. The veracity of Juan de Fuca's claim had long been scoffed at by geographers and is doubted by most historians to the present day. Captain Barkley was probably the first non-indigenous person to find the strait. He was surprised to find it at all because Captain James Cook had previously explored the area and not seen it. Cook had emphatically stated that Juan de Fuca's strait did not exist. Frances Barkley wrote about the discovery in her diary: [...] "In the afternoon, to our great astonishment, we arrived off a large opening extending to the eastward, the entrance of which appeared to be about four leagues wide, and remained about that width as far as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> see, with a clear easterly horizon, which my husband immediately recognized as the long lost strait of Juan de Fuca, and to which he gave the name of the original discoverer, my husband placing it on his chart." [...] Barkley perhaps thought Tatoosh Island was the pinnacle reported by Juan de Fuca as located at {{the entrance to the}} strait. Fellow fur-trader Charles Duncan, who learned about the strait from Barkley, assumed the island was Juan de Fuca's pillar.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{integrated}} two recent, {{at first sight}} contradictory findings regarding the question whether saccadic eye movements can be generated to a newly presented target during an ongoing hand movement. Saccades were measured during so-called adaptive and sustained pointing conditions. In the adapted pointing condition, subjects had to direct both their gaze and arm movements to a displaced target location. The results showed that <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>could</b> fixate <b>the</b> new target during pointing. In addition, a temporal coupling of these corrective saccades was found with changes in arm movement trajectories when reaching to the new target. In the sustained pointing condition, however, the same subjects had {{to point to the}} initial target, while trying to deviate their gaze to a new target that appeared during pointing. It was found that <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>could</b> not fixate <b>the</b> new target before the hand reached the initial target location. Together, the results indicate that ocular gaze is always forced to follow the target intended by a manual arm movement. A neural mechanism is proposed that couples ocular gaze to the target of an arm movement. Specifically, the mechanism includes a reach neuron layer besides the well-known saccadic layer in the primate superior colliculus. Such a tight, sub-cortical coupling of ocular gaze to the target of a reaching movement can explain the contrasting behavior of <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> in dependency of whether <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and hand share the same target position or attempt to move to different locations.

2500|$|Apart from {{creating}} the effects for Clark’s powers, Entity FX {{also has the}} responsibility of dressing up the backgrounds of location shoots. For instance, in a flashback sequence from [...] "Lineage", where Lionel finds his son {{in a field of}} flattened corn, Entity FX had to step in and adjust the scene based on executive producer Ken Horton’s request. The script called for [...] "corn flattened as far as <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>could</b> see", but Horton wanted a defined stopping point for all the destruction; a wall of corn was digitally erected surrounding the area of trammeled corn stalks. For the final shot of the season finale, where Clark is on a motorcycle heading toward Metropolis, Entity FX had to remove the forests and mountains that occupy the Vancouver landscape and digitally insert hills, extend the road into the distance and create a digital version of Metropolis in the background. In the episode [...] "Insurgence", during the moment when Clark is about to make his leap from the Daily Planet to LuthorCorp, the camera pans around the Daily Planet globe revealing Metropolis in its reflection before shifting down to the roof as Clark walks out. Entity FX created the image of Metropolis by using a computer to combine CG buildings, matte paintings, and real elements from the Vancouver streets. The company also took over the rest of the visual elements for the shot of Clark's actual leap. After Welling was shot on a green screen performing the leap from the Daily Planet, Entity FX performed their usual slowing and quickening of the timing elements, to give the effect of Clark’s speed, as well as added a reflected version of Clark in the LuthorCorp building to illustrate Clark’s impending crash through the glass.|$|E
