Its main objective is to demonstrate, through the implementation of a full-scale industrial smartgrid that microgrids can become one of the most suitable solutions for energy generation and management in factories that want to minimize their environmental impact. At a national level it is one of the first experiences regarding the implementation of a smartgrid in an industrial plant with and integrated fleet of electric vehicles.

Microenterprises made significant contributions to development, especially of rural communities by increasing household income and creating employment opportunities to the rural population. In order to profile successful microcredit entrepreneurs, Fatimah-Salwa et al. (2013) conducted a research to identify the key factors contributing to the success. The sample of this study comprises 250 entrepreneurs who joined the scheme of I-Wawasan in Perak.

There were significant differences in the <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of K, Si and soluble sugars in culms and leaf sheaths among the tested rice varieties. The difference in the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of Si was greater than that of K or soluble sugars. The physical strength and maximum bearing capacity of culm continuously decreased from heading to ripening, with a rapid decrease at the dough stage. However, the contents and <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of K and Si in culms and the Si content in leaf sheaths gradually increased and an accumulation of K and Si in culms was exhibited, whereas the content and <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of K and the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of Si in leaf sheaths gradually decreased and an exportation of K and Si in leaf sheaths was presented. The physical strength was positively and significantly correlated with the <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of K and Si in culms during grain filling except that at the heading stage, the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of soluble sugars in culms at the heading and milky stages, the <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of Si and soluble sugars in leaf sheaths at the heading stage, the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of K in leaf sheaths at the heading and milky stages, and the maximum bearing capacity during grain filling. It is suggested that the lodging resistance of japonica rice would be improved by increasing the amount of soluble sugars in plants at the early filling stage, and enhancing the amount of Si in plants during grain filling through topdressing Si fertilizer at the early filling stage...|$|R
