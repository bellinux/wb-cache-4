5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cane</b> toad has poison glands, and the tadpoles {{are highly}} toxic to most animals if ingested. Because of its {{voracious}} appetite, <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad {{has been introduced}} to many regions of the Pacific and the Caribbean islands {{as a method of}} agricultural pest control. The species derives its common name from its use against <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> beetle (Dermolepida albohirtum). <b>The</b> <b>cane</b> toad is now considered a pest and an invasive species in many of its introduced regions; of particular concern is its toxic skin, which kills many animals, both wild and domesticated. Cane toads are particularly dangerous to dogs.|$|E

The {{rules of the}} match were that the one who {{retrieved}} <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> from the pole was allowed to use <b>the</b> <b>cane.</b> Sandman retrieved <b>the</b> <b>cane,</b> {{but before he could}} use it, Carlito performed a Backstabber and pinned him to win the match.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cane</b> toad {{has been}} {{introduced}} to many regions of the worldparticularly the Pacificfor the biological control of agricultural pests.

50|$|A {{loganberry}} bush usually produces {{about ten}} <b>canes</b> (vines). <b>The</b> <b>canes</b> {{are not as}} upright as its raspberry parent, and tend instead to vine more like its blackberry parent. Growth can be undisciplined, with <b>the</b> <b>canes</b> growing five or more feet in a year. Some gardeners train <b>the</b> <b>canes</b> fanwise along a wall or a wire frame. Old canes die after their second year, and should be cut away as they can become diseased, and also hinder harvesting.|$|R

5000|$|One way glassblowers {{incorporate}} cane {{into their}} work is to line up canes on a steel or ceramic plate and heat them slowly to avoid cracking. When the surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>canes</b> just begin to melt, <b>the</b> <b>canes</b> adhere to each other. The tip of a glassblowing pipe (blowpipe) {{is covered with a}} 'collar' of clear molten glass, and touched to one corner of <b>the</b> aligned <b>canes.</b> <b>The</b> tip of the blowpipe is then rolled along the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>canes,</b> which stick to the collar, aligned cylindrically {{around the edge of the}} blowpipe. They are heated further until soft enough to shape. <b>The</b> cylinder of <b>canes</b> is sealed at the bottom with jacks and tweezers, to form the beginning of a bubble. The bubble is then blown using traditional glassblowing techniques.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the early}} 1840s, <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad had been {{introduced}} into Martinique and Barbados, from French Guiana and Guyana. An introduction to Jamaica was made in 1844 {{in an attempt to}} reduce the rat population. Despite its failure to control the rodents, <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad was introduced to Puerto Rico in the early 20th century in the hope that it would counter a beetle infestation ravaging the sugarcane plantations. The Puerto Rican scheme was successful and halted the economic damage caused by the beetles, prompting scientists in the 1930s to promote it as an ideal solution to agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|Bufotenin, {{one of the}} {{chemicals}} excreted by <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad, is classified as a class-1 drug under Australian law, alongside heroin and cannabis. The effects of bufotenin {{are thought to be}} similar to those of mild poisoning; the stimulation, which includes mild hallucinations, lasts for less than an hour. As <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad excretes bufotenin in small amounts, and other toxins in relatively large quantities, toad licking could result in serious illness or death.|$|E
5|$|Cane toads pose {{a serious}} threat to native species when {{introduced}} to a new ecosystem. Classified as an invasive species in over 20 countries, there are multiple reports of <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad moving into a new area to be followed by a decline in the biodiversity in that region. The most documented region of <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad's invasion and subsequent effect on native species is Australia, where multiple surveys and observations of the toad's conquest have been completed. The best way to illustrate this effect is through the plight of the northern quoll, as well as Mertens' water monitor, a large lizard native to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E
50|$|In Malaysia, {{although}} the Education Ordinance 1957 specifically outlaws <b>the</b> <b>caning</b> of girls in school, <b>the</b> <b>caning</b> of girls, usually on {{the palm of}} the hand, is still rather common, especially in primary schools but also occasionally in secondary schools, sometimes even for minor mistakes like being unable to answer questions correctly. In November 2007, {{in response to a}} perceived increase in indiscipline among female students, the National Seminar on Education Regulations (Student Discipline) passed a resolution recommending allowing <b>the</b> <b>caning</b> of female students at school. The resolution is currently in its consultation process.|$|R

5|$|Most frogs {{identify}} prey by movement, {{and vision}} {{appears to be}} the primary method by which <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad detects prey; however, <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad can also locate food using its sense of smell. They eat a wide range of material; in addition to the normal prey of small rodents, reptiles, other amphibians, birds, and even bats and a range of invertebrates, they also eat plants, dog food, and household refuse.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cane</b> toad is {{native to}} the Americas, and its range {{stretches}} from the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas to the central Amazon and southeastern Peru, {{and some of the}} continental islands near Venezuela (such as Trinidad and Tobago). This area encompasses both tropical and semiarid environments. The density of <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad is significantly lower within its native distribution than in places where it has been introduced. In South America, the density was recorded to be 20 adults per 100m (109yd) of shoreline, 1 to 2% of the density in Australia.|$|E
50|$|If {{the medical}} officer {{certifies}} the offender fit, the offender is then confined {{in a holding}} area with other prisoners {{who are going to}} be <b>caned</b> on <b>the</b> same day. The offender is escorted to <b>the</b> <b>caning</b> area when it is his turn to be punished. <b>The</b> <b>caning</b> is conducted in an open yard surrounded by walls in the prison, out of the view of the public and other prisoners. The prison director oversees <b>the</b> <b>caning,</b> along with <b>the</b> medical officer and other prison officers. He reads the terms of punishment to the offender and asks him to confirm the number of strokes.|$|R
50|$|Ballotini is a cane {{technique}} in which several vetro a fili canes are picked up while laid side-by-side {{rather than a}} bundle, with a clear glass gather over them.

5|$|Following the {{apparent}} success of <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad in eating the beetles threatening the sugarcane plantations of Puerto Rico, and the fruitful introductions into Hawaii and the Philippines, a strong push {{was made for}} <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad {{to be released in}} Australia to negate the pests ravaging the Queensland cane fields. As a result, 102 toads were collected from Hawaii and brought to Australia. After an initial release in August 1935, the Commonwealth Department of Health decided to ban future introductions until a study was conducted into the feeding habits of the toad. The study was completed in 1936 and the ban lifted, when large-scale releases were undertaken; by March 1937, 62,000 toadlets had been released into the wild. The toads became firmly established in Queensland, increasing exponentially in number and extending their range into the Northern Territory and New South Wales. In 2010, one was found on the far western coast in Broome, Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|However, Elton ends {{up being}} cornered in a dead end alley. As he resigns himself to being absorbed, the TARDIS materializes and the Doctor and Rose emerge from within. The Abzorbaloff {{attempts}} to ransom Elton {{in exchange for the}} Doctor, but the Doctor feigns disinterest in Elton's fate, while dropping a hint to the absorbed members of LINDA. In response, the absorbed members collectively use their willpower to suppress the Abzorbaloff, who ends up dropping his cane. At Ursula's prompting, Elton breaks <b>the</b> <b>cane,</b> which causes the Abzorbaloff to melt into the ground. The Doctor explains that <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> created a limitation field to suppress the alien's power, but with it broken, he lost control and his power caused him to be absorbed by the ground. The Doctor then recalls his first encounter with Elton, and explains that he was at Elton's house years ago tracking an elemental shade, but he was too late and the shade killed Elton's mother.|$|E
5|$|However, the toad was {{generally}} unsuccessful {{in reducing the}} targeted grey-backed cane beetles (Dermolepida albohirtum), in part because <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> fields provided insufficient shelter for the predators during the day, {{in part because the}} beetles live at the tops of sugar cane – and cane toads are not good climbers. Since its original introduction, <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad has had a particularly marked effect on Australian biodiversity. The population of a number of native predatory reptiles has declined, such as the varanid lizards Varanus mertensi, V. mitchelli, and V. panoptes, the land snakes Pseudechis australis and Acanthophis antarcticus, and the crocodile species Crocodylus johnstoni; in contrast, the population of the agamid lizard Amphibolurus gilbertiknown to be a prey item of V. panopteshas increased.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad {{closely resembles}} many bufonid species. In particular, {{it could be}} {{confused}} with the southern toad (Bufo terrestris), which can be distinguished by the presence of two bulbs in front of the parotoid glands.|$|E
5|$|Iridomyrmex {{primarily}} {{feeds on}} sweet {{foods such as}} nectar and honeydew. They hunt for insects and other ants to feed to their young, and workers are particularly attracted to seeds with elaiosomes. They collect these seeds, remove the elaiosomes, and then discard the seeds. The seedlings that sprout from these seeds benefit from proximity to the aggressive Iridomyrmex ants, giving them {{a better chance of}} survival. Colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are regularly preyed on by Iridomyrmex; no evidence for any kind of relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. Juvenile cane toads are often preyed on, as certain Iridomyrmex species such as I. purpureus and I. ruburrus are immune to the toxins released by <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toads. As a result, placing Iridomyrmex nests in habitats which house cane toads have been suggested as a method of controlling <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad population. The meat ant is the only known ant in Australia that feeds on guano.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{are able}} to kill {{poisonous}} cane toads, an introduced pest, as the toxins exuded by toad, that usually kill <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad's predators, do not affect the meat ants. Due to this, scientists in Australia have considered using meat ants {{as a form of}} pest control to reduce <b>the</b> <b>cane</b> toad population. One way of doing this is by establishing meat ant nests in habitats where cane toad numbers are high. In rural Australia, meat ants are important to farmers, who place animal carcasses on ant nests to get rid of them. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass is consumed and reduced to bones. Due to the meat ants aggression, workers will pour out of entrance holes to attack if a human or animal disturbs their nest.|$|E

50|$|Lovell {{was born}} in a Chattel house in Parish Land, Christ Church, Barbados and grew up around rich {{storytelling}} among <b>the</b> sugar <b>cane</b> workers.

60|$|The {{next day}} the work began. <b>The</b> <b>canes</b> were cut at a level with the ground, the tops were taken off, and <b>the</b> <b>canes</b> cut into lengths of three feet. They were then packed on a bullock cart and taken up to the house. They were next passed through the mangle, which succeeded admirably, the juice flowing out in streams into the tub placed below to receive it. When all <b>the</b> <b>canes</b> had been passed through the mangle, the screws were {{tightened}} to increase the pressure, and they were again passed through; by which time, although the juice was not so thoroughly extracted {{as it would have}} been by a more powerful machine, the quantity that remained was not important. As the tub was filled the contents were taken to the great copper, under which a fire was then lighted. The crushing of <b>the</b> <b>canes</b> was continued until the copper was nearly full, when Mr. Hardy ordered the cutting of <b>the</b> <b>canes</b> to be discontinued for the day. The fire under the copper was fed with <b>the</b> crushed <b>canes,</b> which burned very freely. Mr. Hardy now added a small quantity of lime and some sheep's blood, which last ingredient caused many exclamations of horror from Mrs. Hardy and the young ones. The blood, however, Mr. Hardy informed them, was necessary to clarify the sugar, as the albumen contained in the blood would rise to the surface, bringing the impurities with it. The fire was continued until the thermometer showed that the syrup was within a few degrees of boiling, and the surface was covered with a thick, dark-colored scum. The fire was then removed, and the liquor allowed to cool, the family now going about other work, as so large a quantity of liquor would not be really cold until the next day.|$|R
