5|$|Almon played {{high school}} {{football}} at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Secondary School. He initially played as a defensive end, but converted to <b>the</b> <b>tight</b> end position where he played {{for most of his}} high school career. As a senior in 1996, he was nominated to be the Burlington Spectator Athlete of the Week for his contributions to the football team. The St. Thomas Aquinas team {{went on to win the}} county championship that year. Almon also played ice hockey and competed in shot put with the track and field team in high school.|$|E
5|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>tight</b> rationing, a {{black market}} {{in food and}} other {{consumer}} goods emerged. Food {{on the black market}} was extremely expensive. Prices could be 650 percent higher than in legal shops and rose constantly during the war. Because of the profits to be made, the black market spawned large and well-organised networks. Numerous members of the German administration were involved in the black market, stealing military or official supplies and reselling them.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland pursued former Steelers {{coach and}} Browns linebacker Bill Cowher and former Browns scout Scott Pioli {{for the head}} {{coaching}} job. The team, however, hired former New York Jets coach Eric Mangini in January 2009. Before {{the start of the}} season, Mangini and the front office traded Winslow to the Buccaneers after five seasons marked by injuries and a motorcycle crash that threatened to end <b>the</b> <b>tight</b> end's career. The Browns showed little sign of improvement in Mangini's first year, finishing 5–11 in 2009. While Cleveland lost 11 of its first 12 games, the team won the final four games of the season, including a 13–6 victory over the rival Steelers.|$|E

5|$|Dallin {{finished}} his models in August 1920 and the commission referred the designs to sculptor member James Earle Fraser. On examining Dallin's work, Fraser deemed the lettering crude, {{but in an}} undated letter to Moore (probably late August) regretted that due to <b>the</b> <b>tight</b> timeline for production, there was no opportunity to make changes. He suggested that the Mint be urged to allow three months in future for CFA consideration. After the commission met on September 3, a letter to that effect {{was sent to the}} Director of the United States Mint, Raymond T. Baker. The letter was ignored, but the Treasury approved the designs.|$|E
5|$|Designed within <b>the</b> <b>tight</b> 35,000 ton {{limitations}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, wartime service necessitated increases over the design displacement, seriously reducing freeboard and affecting seaworthiness. This was most acute at the already low bow. With too little buoyancy forward the bows were easily buried even in moderate seas, with spray washing up over both forward turrets. Heavy seas could flood ‘A’ turret, drenching both men and machinery within.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} early August 2015, during the wet season, in the Idukki {{district}} of Kerala. Major {{portions of the}} film were shot in Thopramkudy, near Kattappana. In September, while filming in Cheruthoni, Faasil sustained a leg injury while performing a stunt with co-star Sujith Shanker. Although a two-day rest was advised, he decided to press on because of <b>the</b> <b>tight</b> shooting schedule. The filming in Idukki, which took 45 days, was wrapped up in late October.|$|E

5|$|First Class entered {{production}} in August 2010, with principal photography concluding in December and additional filming finishing in April 2011, {{just a few}} weeks before the film's premiere in June 2011. <b>The</b> <b>tight</b> schedule proved a challenge to the six companies responsible for the extensive visual effects, which included computer-generated sets and digital doubles for the actors. Locations included Oxford, the Mojave desert and Georgia, with soundstage work done in both Pinewood Studios and the 20th Century Fox stages in Los Angeles. The depiction of the 1960s drew inspiration from the James Bond films of the period.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Florence {{produced}} strong swells {{and dangerous}} surf conditions {{along the northern}} Lesser Antilles, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Bermuda. Later in its duration, <b>the</b> <b>tight</b> pressure gradient between Florence and a high-pressure system over southeastern Canada produced strong winds and rough waves along the East Coast of the United States. The hurricane also caused strong swells and rough ocean conditions, including rip currents, in the Bahamas and Atlantic Canada. In South Carolina, high waves produced severe beach erosion on several beaches.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 2015, Queen Mary 2 began a 175th Anniversary Crossing in Southampton. She sailed {{first to}} Liverpool, leaving that city after a {{fireworks}} display on 4 July, the actual anniversary date of Cunard's first transatlantic voyage. Queen Mary 2 followed {{the route of}} the original ship Britannia, calling first at Halifax, Nova Scotia. After a day there, she headed first upriver into the harbor, using her bow thrusters and swivel-pod motors to negotiate <b>the</b> <b>tight</b> turnaround to come back down close to the cityfront. A 21-gun salute and bagpipe band honored the ship.|$|E

The malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be fatal. An example of a fatal genetic disease due to enzyme insufficiency is Tay-Sachs disease, in which patients lack the enzyme hexosaminidase.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the village of Ashington was based entirely around coal mining, and though his family had a strong footballing pedigree, {{his father was a}} miner. The eldest of four {{brothers}} – Bobby, Gordon and Tommy – <b>the</b> <b>tight</b> finances of the family meant that all four siblings shared the same bed. His father, Bob, had no interest in football, but his mother, Cissie, played football with her children and later coached the local schools team. As a teenager she took them to watch Ashington and Newcastle United play, and Charlton remained a lifelong Newcastle supporter.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, the Council of Ministers {{ordered that}} a small batch of jets from each OKB were {{to participate in the}} 7 November parade commemorating the October Revolution. Because of <b>the</b> <b>tight</b> deadline, the components for the two incomplete prototypes were turned over to Factory No. 301 at Khimki, the new headquarters for the Lavochkin OKB, for assembly by Factory No. 381. Factory No. 21 in Gorky joined the program with three more aircraft built in record time with support from Factory No. 301. Tooling was constructed in 5–10 days with the first aircraft completed in a week and a half.|$|E

5|$|The four {{remaining}} {{survivors of}} the French fleet had mostly avoided pursuit, and by 19 October were nearing Brest independently, hoping to slip through <b>the</b> <b>tight</b> British blockade around the harbour. Captain Mathieu-Charles Bergevin on Romaine had attempted to land the troops aboard his ship in Ireland on 13 October, but was forced to abandon this plan when the soldiers refused to be put ashore. He then sailed southwest and successfully avoided all contact with British forces, joining with the schooner Biche and arriving at Brest on 23 October. The same day, after outrunning Révolutionaire's pursuit, Sémillante arrived in Lorient—the last French ship to return home.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} receivers are {{the wide}} receivers (WR) and <b>the</b> <b>tight</b> ends (TE). Wide receivers line up {{on or near}} the line of scrimmage, split outside the line. The main goal of the wide receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback, but they may also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays. Tight ends line up outside the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tight</b> {{schedule}} {{allowed only}} two weeks for rehearsal and 44 days for filming, as it was already {{the tail end of}} summer. The cast stayed in the same hotel at Mountain Lake Lodge in Pembroke, Virginia and at the 1927 Lake Lure Inn & Spa in Lake Lure, N.C. Rehearsals quickly turned into disco parties involving nearly every cast member, even non-dancers such as Jack Weston.|$|E

5|$|While passing to {{the south}} of the island, <b>the</b> <b>tight</b> {{pressure}} gradient between the precursor extratropical storm and high pressures resulted in strong winds on the island, including sustained winds of hurricane status at Fort George. Gusts on the island officially peaked at 100mph (161km/h) at Devonshire. A cruise ship anchored at harbor reported a wind gust of 118mph (190km/h), though it could have been caused by a downdraft. The storm also dropped moderate rainfall of just over 3inches (76mm), resulting in minor flooding of streets. Because the storm developed quickly, wave-induced beach erosion was minor.|$|E
5|$|Allgame gave {{positive}} {{reviews of}} the game. It said that game includes everything from hidden items, simplistic gameplay, fun and replay value, and basic but good-looking graphics. Defunct Games called Wonder Boy in Monster Land the most challenging game in the Wonder Boy series, noting the lack of passwords or continues in the Master System version, the relatively few chances to earn extra lives, and a time limit. The review said {{that the ability to}} earn gold and upgrade equipment which are laid out in the status screen tremendously adds to the replay value. It praised the responsive, though sometimes not precise, controls and <b>the</b> <b>tight</b> hit detection. Moreover, it said that the graphics were colorful and that it complemented the music and its simplistic sound effects well. Overall, the review said that the game is recommended for Master System and platforming fans alike.|$|E
5|$|Baker, de Francisci, and Moore met in Washington on December 15. At that time, Baker, who {{hoped to}} start Peace dollar {{production}} in 1921, outlined <b>the</b> <b>tight</b> schedule {{for this to}} be accomplished, and requested certain design changes. Among these was the inclusion of the broken sword from the sculptor's alternate reverse design, to be placed under the eagle, on the mountaintop on which it stands, in addition to the olive branch. Baker approved the designs, subject to these changes. The revised designs were presented to President Harding on December 19. Harding insisted on the removal of a small feature of Liberty's face, which seemed to him to suggest a dimple, something he did not consider suggestive of peace, and the sculptor then did so.|$|E
