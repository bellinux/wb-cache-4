5|$|Adam used several leitmotifs in <b>the</b> <b>ballet.</b> This {{is a short}} musical {{phrase that}} is {{associated}} with a certain character, event, or idea. Adam's leitmotifs are heard several times throughout <b>the</b> <b>ballet.</b> There is a leitmotif associated with Giselle and another with Albrecht. Hilarion's motif marks his every entrance. It suggests the Fate theme in Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ballet</b> {{was staged}} by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1911 at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, with Tamara Karsavina and Nijinsky as Giselle and Albrecht. Anna Pavlova danced Giselle {{with her own}} company in 1913. Alicia Markova danced the role with the Vic-Wells Ballet in 1934, and Margot Fonteyn took the role in 1937 when Markova left the company.

5|$|After {{donating}} {{money to}} public television, Marge receives complimentary ballet tickets. She asks Homer to accompany her, {{and much to}} Marge's surprise he agrees, confusing ballet with a circus. On the day of <b>the</b> <b>ballet,</b> however, he inadvertently gets his arm stuck in a vending machine while trying to steal a can of soda from it and then gets his other arm stuck in a candy machine, and so is unable to attend <b>the</b> <b>ballet.</b> In disbelief about Homer's story, Marge invites her neighbor, Ruth Powers to attend with her. They both enjoy themselves and arrange to go out again the next night. Marge and Ruth's friendship annoys Homer, who feels Marge should be spending time with him instead. However, ignoring Homer's protests, Marge and Ruth visit bars and clubs in Springfield, and Ruth later shows Marge {{how to use a}} pistol.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky {{conceived}} the premise by connecting his viewings of {{a production of}} Swan Lake with an unrealized screenplay about understudies {{and the notion of}} being haunted by a double, similar to the folklore surrounding doppelgängers. Aronofsky cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Double as another inspiration for the film. The director also considered Black Swan a companion piece to his 2008 film The Wrestler, with both films involving demanding performances for different kinds of art. He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000, and after a brief attachment to Universal Studios, Black Swan was produced in New York City in 2009 by Fox Searchlight Pictures. Portman and Kunis trained in ballet for several months prior to filming, and notable figures from <b>the</b> <b>ballet</b> world helped with film production to shape <b>the</b> <b>ballet</b> presentation.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{life has}} also been used {{in a wide variety}} of other media. The {{director}} David Bintley used Marlowe's play as the basis for <b>the</b> <b>ballet</b> Edward II, first performed in 1995; the music from <b>the</b> <b>ballet</b> forms a part of composer John McCabe's symphony Edward II, produced in 2000. Novels such as John Penford's 1984 The Gascon and Chris Hunt's 1992 Gaveston have focused on the sexual aspects of Edward and Gaveston's relationship, while Stephanie Merritt's 2002 Gaveston transports the story into the 20th century. Marcus Stone's painting Edward II and Piers Gaveston strongly hinted at a homosexual relationship between the pair, while avoiding making this aspect explicit; it was initially shown at the Royal Academy in 1872, but was marginalised in later decades as the issue of homosexuality became more sensitive.|$|E

5|$|Giselle {{was first}} {{performed}} in Russia at the Bolshoi Theatre, St. Petersburg, on 18 December 1842. Stepan Gedeonov, the Director of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, sent his ballet master Antoine Titus to Paris {{to find a}} new ballet for ballerina Yelena Andreyanova. Titus chose Giselle. <b>The</b> <b>Ballet</b> Master then staged the work completely from memory in St. Petersburg. Perrot produced Giselle in St. Petersburg in 1851. He made many changes to <b>the</b> <b>ballet</b> in his years of service to the Imperial Ballet. In the 1880s, Petipa made many changes to the Perrot production.|$|E
5|$|Giselle {{was mounted}} by other ballet {{companies}} in Europe and America {{almost immediately after}} its first night. The British had their first taste of Giselle with a drama based on <b>the</b> <b>ballet</b> called Giselle, or The Phantom Night Dancers by William Moncrieff, who had seen <b>the</b> <b>ballet</b> in Paris the same year. The play was performed on 23 August 1841 at the Theatre Royal, Sadler's Wells. The actual ballet was first staged in London at Her Majesty's Theatre on 12 March 1842 with Grisi as Giselle and Perrot as Albrecht. The dances were credited to Perrot and one Deshayes. This production was revived many times, once in 1884 with a Mlle. Sismondi {{in the role of}} Albrecht. This production, preceded by an operetta called Pocahontas, met with little enthusiasm.|$|E
5|$|Hopes that <b>the</b> <b>ballet</b> {{would be}} ready in May were dashed and the opening night was {{postponed}} several times. Grisi was absent {{for a few days}} and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb at the end of <b>the</b> <b>ballet,</b> it was decided that she would be placed on a bed of flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic mood of the Act II finale.|$|E

5|$|After {{its last}} {{performance}} at the Gaiety in 1872, Thespis appears to have remained unperformed until 1953, although an attempted reconstruction from the 1940s has been discovered.

5|$|Disillusioned with Covent Garden, MacMillan {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the Deutsche Oper in Berlin to run its ballet company. Parry describes this as an unhappy experience. Though at Covent Garden Webster may sometimes have been suspected of favouring the opera {{at the expense of}} <b>the</b> <b>ballet,</b> MacMillan discovered that at the Berlin house there was no doubt that <b>the</b> <b>ballet</b> was given distinctly lower priority. He did not speak German, which reduced his enjoyment from watching films (of which he was a great devotee) and theatre and limited him generally in everyday life. Although he had taken several colleagues with him, including Seymour, many moved away {{over the course of his}} nearly four years in charge, and MacMillan became increasingly isolated. It was the first time he had been in a managerial as well as a creative role, and the strain affected his physical and mental health. He smoked and drank heavily and suffered a minor stroke.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1830s {{until the late}} 1840s Her Majesty's Theatre played host to {{the heyday of the}} era of the romantic ballet, and the theatre's {{resident}} ballet company was considered the most renowned in Europe, aside from <b>the</b> <b>Ballet</b> du Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique in Paris. The celebrated ballet master Jules Perrot began staging ballet at Her Majesty's in 1830. Lumley appointed him Premier Maître de Ballet (chief choreographer) to the theatre in 1842. Among the works of ballet that he staged were Ondine, ou La Naïade (1843), La Esmeralda (1844), and Catarina, ou La Fille du Bandit (1846), as well as the celebrated divertissement Pas de Quatre (1845). Other ballet masters created works for <b>the</b> <b>ballet</b> of Her Majesty's Theatre throughout the period of the romantic ballet, most notably Paul Taglioni (son of Filippo Taglioni), who staged ballets including Coralia, ou Le Chevalier inconstant (1847) and Electra (1849, the first production of a ballet to make use of electric lighting). Arthur Saint-Léon staged such works as La Vivandière (1844), Le Violin du Diable (1849), and Le Jugement de Pâris (1850), which was considered a sequel of sorts to Pas de Quatre.|$|E
5|$|Giselle {{was first}} staged in Italy at Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 17 January 1843. The music however was not Adam's {{but that of}} Niccolò Bajetti.
