The supreme court proceeding were suggested to take place with the use of English, to encourage the study and use of English by judges and lawyers, but the efforts were futile.

5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before <b>the</b> <b>courts.</b> Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> at a later stage.

5|$|Exclusion of {{judicial}} review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect the exercise of executive power.

In contrast, Singapore cases suggest that ouster clauses cannot prevent the High Court from exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of executive power where authorities have committed jurisdictional errors of law, but are effective against non-jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E
