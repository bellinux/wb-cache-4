5|$|A hybrid eclipse (also called annular/total eclipse) shifts {{between a}} <b>total</b> <b>and</b> annular eclipse. At certain {{points on the}} surface of Earth, it appears as a total eclipse, whereas at other points it appears as annular. Hybrid eclipses are {{comparatively}} rare.|$|E

5|$|During the 21st century, {{there will}} be 224 solar eclipses of which 77 will be partial, 72 will be annular, 68 will be <b>total</b> <b>and</b> 7 will be hybrids between <b>total</b> <b>and</b> annular eclipses. Of these, two annular and one total eclipse will be non-central, {{in the sense that}} the very center (axis) of the moon's shadow will miss the earth (for more {{information}} see gamma). In the 21st century the greatest number of eclipses in one year is four, in 2011, 2029, 2047, 2065, 2076, and 2094. The predictions given here are by Fred Espenak of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.|$|E

5|$|As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's {{distance}} from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its {{distance from}} the Earth, {{and it is this}} effect that leads to the difference between <b>total</b> <b>and</b> annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its perigee) that a total eclipse occurs.|$|E

40|$|Aims: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} water stress effect on <b>total</b> phenolics <b>and</b> <b>total</b> antioxidants of selected African nightshades and determine any possible variations in the amount of <b>total</b> phenolics <b>and</b> <b>total</b> antioxidants among the accessions grown. Study Design: Study was conducted on the basis of randomized complete block design. Place and Duration of Study: The study was carried out in Kenyatta University Agricultural farm in Kiambu County of Kenya. Greenhouse experiments were carried out in the same farm. Methodology: A greenhouse and field experiment was conducted to investigate effects of water stress on <b>total</b> phenolic <b>and</b> <b>total</b> antioxidant contents of Solanum scabrum and Solanum villosum. The two African nightshades were subjected to different soil water tensions of 15 cbars, 50 cbars and 85 cbars. After a month of transplanting, samples from the different blocks were collected fortnightly <b>and</b> prepared for <b>total</b> phenolic <b>and</b> <b>total</b> antioxidant determination. Results: Obtained data showed that Solanum villosum had a higher concentration of both the <b>total</b> phenolics <b>and</b> antioxidant activity in the shoots (46. 41 g/Kg <b>total</b> phenolic content <b>and</b> 52. 68 % total antioxidant activity) while Solanum scabrum had higher concentration in the roots (25. 06 g/Kg <b>total</b> phenolic content <b>and</b> 27. 18 % total antioxidant activity). Conclusion: <b>Total</b> phenolics <b>and</b> <b>total</b> antioxidant accumulation not only depend on irrigation variation but also on the accessions grown...|$|R
