40|$|Background: Chemotherapy is an {{important}} treatment for cancer, yet some of its side effects are serious and painful. Many patients with cancer suffer from psychiatric disorders that most likely result from therapeutic drugs or mental strategies to cope with their illness. Progressive muscle relaxation {{is one of the}} cost effective, self-help methods that promotes mental health in healthy participants. This study aims to determine the effect of progressive muscle relaxation training on anxiety and depression in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Methods: This was a randomized, clinical study that enrolled 60 patients who received inpatient chemotherapy in the Tabriz Hematology and Oncology Research Center in 2010. We divided patients into two groups, intervention and control. All participants signed written formal consents and completed the Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale questionnaires.

40|$|Abstract: Effective fishery {{management}} requires accurate {{data on the}} harvest, effort, cost, and price levels in the fishery. This study uses a monthly sampling approach to gathering data from blue crab harvesters in Virginia. There has been much concern expressed recently that effort levels in the Chesapeake Bay blue crab fishery may be increasing due to {{the decline of the}} oyster and finfish fisheries. Before 1993 the only available data were harvest and price levels, which were gathered through a voluntary reporting system, which relied on crab processors rather than harvesters for information. This study attempted to gather information on fishery characteristics through a monthly sampling of Virginia crab pot license holders. Our survey was well received by watermen, with a 60 % response rate. Harvest, effort, cost, and price data, reported by each respondent for only one month, were aggregated to the whole population and for the whole season.

5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{and their}} closer neighbours mostly {{cost less than}} silver; only polonium and astatine are more expensive than gold, on account of their significant radioactivity. As of 5 April 2014, prices for small samples (up to 100 g) of silicon, antimony and tellurium, and graphite, aluminium and selenium, average around one third the cost of silver (US$1.5 per gram or about $45 an ounce). Boron, germanium and arsenic samples average about three-and-a-half times the cost of silver. Polonium is available for about $100 per microgram. Zalutsky and Pruszynski estimate a similar cost for producing astatine.

5|$|Fire {{is another}} {{important}} element in {{the maintenance of the}} Everglades. The majority are caused by lightning strikes from thunderstorms during the wet season. Their effects are largely superficial, and serve to foster further plant growth: sawgrass will burn above water, but the roots are preserved. Fire in the sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes and trees, and releases nutrients from decaying plant matter more efficiently than decomposition. Large burned areas also affect waterflow, since wind and water are undeterred by the eradicated sawgrass; water may flow <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> faster in recently burned areas. During the wet season only dead plant matter and the tips of plants are burned; however, the effects of fire are much more significant in the dry season, as fire may be fed by organic peat and burn deeply, destroying root systems. The only impediment to the spread of fire in the Everglades is the presence of water. It takes around 225years for one foot (0.3m) of peat to develop, but the peat is not as dense as it should be for the 5,000years of the Everglades' existence. Scientists point to fire as the reason.|$|E

5|$|The disease term venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) {{includes the}} development of either DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). Genetic factors that {{increase the risk of}} VTE include deficiencies of three proteins that normally prevent blood from clotting—protein C, protein S, and antithrombin—in addition to non-O blood type and mutations in the factor V and prothrombin genes. Deficiencies in antithrombin, protein C, and protein S are rare but strong, or moderately strong, risk factors. These three thrombophilia increase the risk of VTE by about 10 times. Factor V Leiden, which makes factor V resistant to inactivation by activated protein C, and the genetic variant prothrombin G20210A, which causes increased prothrombin levels, are predominantly expressed in Caucasians. They moderately increase risk for VTE, by three to eight times for factor V Leiden and <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> for prothrombin G20210A. Having a non-O blood type roughly doubles VTE risk. Non-O blood type is common in all races, making it an important risk factor.

5|$|Great spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings {{sometimes}} lasting twenty years. Nests {{are made}} in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk takes up 65% of the egg. In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% of the egg. This makes the kiwi egg the largest {{in proportion to the}} body. Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size of the egg, gestation is uncomfortable for the female, and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water when they come out of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles. The egg-laying season is between August and January.|$|E

30|$|The {{included}} clinical articles implemented various dosimetry protocols. Most studies applied S value based dosimetry {{from difference}} sources, despite recommendations to use voxel-based approaches [57, 72]. In our opinion, dose kernels {{are the most}} appropriate method for dosimetry in PRRT. The main reason is that heterogeneous organ and tumour uptake can be taken into consideration, yet the method is more practicable compared to the complicated MC simulations [24, 46]. Furthermore, the number of time points for post-therapy imaging was diverse. Current guidelines do not propose specific time points, but address the essence of dispersed post-therapy imaging in case of slow radiopharmaceutical washout [73]. <b>Two</b> <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>time</b> points in both the uptake and excretion phase are recommended [30]. Nevertheless, for wide clinical implementation four up to six time points are unsuitable for clinical departments as it is time consuming. Recent research has focussed on optimising the number of time points, for example by only using one late time point [74]. Maaβ et al. applied pharmacokinetic models based on individual and population information to estimate kidney and tumour uptake with different sampling schedules [75]. For the kidneys, the use of only the 4  h and 2  days time point allowed for sufficient time-integrated activities estimates. This approach was not appropriate for tumours, as the uptake variability between patients is large, so for tumour dosimetry, one has to stick <b>to</b> at least <b>two</b> early and two late time points. Finally, the importance of late time point imaging to estimate {{the tail of the}} curve was pointed out by multiple clinical papers [52, 53, 58 – 60].|$|R
