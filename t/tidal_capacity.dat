It is shown that the standard Input–Output (IO) modelling approach significantly overstates the employment and value added impacts compared to Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) methods—in which short-run scarcity of factors of production are explicitly modelled.

While wind and wave resources are increasingly forecastable, they are stochastic in nature.

With the first Crown Estate leasing round complete for wave and tidal current energy, plans are in place to install 1000 MW of <b>tidal</b> <b>capacity</b> in the Pentland Firth and Orkney waters. The aim of the work presented in this thesis is to examine the role tidal current energy can realistically play in the future electricity mix. To achieve this objective it was first necessary to develop new methodologies to capture the temporal and spatial variability of tidal current dynamics over long timescales and identify metrics relevant in a tidal energy context. These methodologies were developed for project scale resource characterisation, and provided a basis for development of a national scale dataset. The creation of project and national scale tidal datasets capture spatial and temporal variability at a level beyond previous insight, as demonstrated in case studies of three important early stage tidal current energy development sites. The provision of a robust national scale dataset enabled the development of realistic scenarios for the growth of the tidal current energy sector in UK waters. Assessing the various scenarios proposed indicates that first-generation technology solutions have the potential to generate up to 31 TWh/yr (over 8...|$|E

The Cape Verde Islands, located off the coast of West Africa in the central Atlantic Ocean, witnessed a wave power exceeding 7 kW/m in coastal areas neighboring the islands, with the summer season recording around half the wave potential of the winter season [7]. The island of El Hierro, situated south west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean estimates its wave potential to be of the order of 25 kW/m, reflecting on the possibility of harnessing energy from waves [8].|$|R

METHODS: 25 children aged 4 - 16 years with CF performed pulmonary function tests to assess short-term variability at baseline and response to routine airway clearance. Tidal helium and sulfur hexafluoride (double-tracer gas: DTG) SBW, tidal capnography, <b>tidal</b> and vital <b>capacity</b> nitrogen (N 2) SBW and spirometry were applied.

From these tests, individual change of SnIII from tidal DTG-SBW and FEV 1 exceeded short-term variability in 10 and 6 children.

[Subjects and Methods] The subjects for this study were twenty randomly selected males and females from K University. Measurements were taken in the supine position at three different pillow heights: 0 cm, 5 cm, and 10 cm. Pulmonary functions (vital <b>capacity,</b> <b>tidal</b> volume, inspiratory re-serve volume, and expiratory reserve volume) were evaluated using a Fit mate. [Results] These findings suggest that a pillow height of 5 cm makes a significant difference in vital capacity (VC). When the three pillow heights were compared, significant differences were seen between 0 cm and 5 cm, and between 5 cm and 10 cm, in terms of vital capacity for the pulmonary functions among the three positions. [Conclusion] In conclusion, changing the positions of the subjects produces changes in pulmonary functions. The greatest change occurred in the 5 cm pillow height. Presumably, ventilation is affected by the body structures.

A total of 45 students from the University of Lagos were studied. 20 were athletes who had exercised daily in the past 2 - 3 years, and the remaining 25 were non-exercising non-athletes who served as controls. The subjects were divided into male and female groups. Results from the study showed that TV and FVC, but not FEV were significantly higher in male athletes than in male non-athletes.

These results suggest that the respiratory functional capacity of athletes in Nigeria could be generally superior to that of non-athletes as a result of increased development of respiratory musculature incidental to the physical training whose intensity is a strong determining factor.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{conduct a}} blinded {{evaluation}} of the predictors of weaning from mechanical ventilation. DESIGN: A prospective clinical study. SETTING: A 23 -bed general intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Ninety-three non-selected patients, ventilated for more than 48 h. METHODS: The study had two steps: at first, patients' data were used to select the cut-off value for weaning predictors (the minimal false classification). The cut-off value for each index was prospectively assessed {{in a group of}} 52 patients. The predictive performance of these indexes was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. In the prospective-validation set we used Bayes' theorem to assess the probability of each test in predicting weaning. The physicians making decisions about the weaning process were always unaware of the predictive values. Weaning was considered successful if spontaneous breathing was sustained for more than 48 h after extubation. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: During the first 2 min after discontinuation of mechanical ventilation the following tests were performed: vital <b>capacity,</b> <b>tidal</b> volume, airway occlusion pressure (P(0. 1)), minute ventilation, respiratory rate, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/V(T)), P(0. 1) /MIP and P(0. 1) x f/V(T).

40|$|Marine {{energy in}} the UK is {{currently}} undergoing a period of exponential growth in terms of development and implementation. The current installed <b>tidal</b> energy <b>capacity</b> of around 4 MW {{is expected to rise}} to provide up to 20 % of the UK’s electricity demand by 2050 [5]. With this in mind, there is a huge range of energy devices, all seemingly promoted by their developers as the best method of extracting power from the ocean. Embodied energy is an important aspect of any power producing device or process, and is used to describe the amount of energy required to begin and maintain the process of energy generation. Until a device or process has generated this amount of energy it cannot be said to be a net contributor of energy. This work used Life Cycle Assessment to study four tidal energy devices, representing a cross section of the existing designs, and compares their embodied energy and carbon dioxide emissions. In order to ensure a fair comparison, a hypothetical installation site is used, with conditions typical of those found at potential array installation sites in the UK. The designs studied include a multi-blade turbine, two three blade horizontal axis turbine machines, and an Archimedes’ screw device. These machines were chosen to represent a cross section of device, foundation, installation and operation designs. They have all been developed to prototype stage, meaning that actual manufacturing data is available. Embodied energy is considered over the entire lifetime of each device, beginning with extraction of raw materials. Energy use from fabrication, transport, installation, lifetime maintenance, end-of-life decommissioning and recycling are all calculated, and compared to the energy generation from each device at the test site. Finally, the embodied energy; CO 2 intensity; and energy payback periods are compared to those of conventional power generating systems as well as other renewable energy sources. A range of data sources are used. Embodied energy of steel has been provided by the World Steel Association. Of the four devices studied, all were found to achieve CO 2 and energy payback within the first 12 years of their lifetime, and exhibited CO 2 intensity of between 18 and 35 gCO 2 /kWh. This compares favourably to many current energy sources, and is likely to fall as technology improves, array size increases and industry experience progresses...|$|R

DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective, open study at a tertiary university hospital. METHODS: Twenty-six patients underwent elective craniotomy for aneurysm clipping (11) or tumor resection (15). Vital <b>capacity</b> (VC), <b>tidal</b> volume (TV), minute volume (VE) and respiratory rate were determined before the operation and on the first to fourth postoperative days. RESULTS: There were significant decreases of 25 % in VC, 22 % in TV and 12 % in VE (p < 0. 05) and no significant increase in respiratory frequency (5 %) on the first postoperative day.

Laminectomy {{is considered to be}} a peripheral surgical procedure, but it is possible that thoracic spinal surgery exerts a greater influence on lung function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pulmonary volumes and maximum respiratory pressures of patients undergoing cervical, thoracic or lumbar spinal surgery. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective study in a tertiary-level university hospital. METHODS: Sixty-three patients undergoing laminectomy due to diagnoses of tumors or herniated discs were evaluated. Vital <b>capacity,</b> <b>tidal</b> volume, minute ventilation and maximum respiratory pressures were evaluated preoperatively and on the first and second postoperative days. Possible associations between the respiratory variables and the duration of the operation, surgical diagnosis and smoking status were investigated. RESULTS: Vital capacity and maximum inspiratory pressure presented reductions on the first postoperative day (20. 9 % and 91. 6 %, respectively) for thoracic surgery (P = 0. 01), and maximum expiratory pressure showed reductions on the first postoperative day in cervical surgery patients (15. 3 %; P = 0. 004). The incidence of pulmonary complications was 3. 6 %. CONCLUSIONS: There were reductions in vital capacity and maximum respiratory pressures during the postoperative period in patients undergoing laminectomy.

This is impractical for intensive care unit patients under ventilation or for pediatric populations {{under the age of}} 3 to 4 years. To address this problem, we propose a free-breathing protocol for hyperpolarized He lung ventilation spiral imaging. This approach was evaluated in vitro and on rabbits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The protocol was implemented on a clinical 1. 5 -T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Ventilation images were acquired using a spiral sequence, in vitro on a lung phantom and in vivo on rabbits, the animal breathing freely from a gas reservoir. Dynamic spiral ventilation images were reconstructed using retrospective Cine synchronization. Magnetic resonance (MR) signal dynamics was modeled taking account of gas inflow and outflow, radiofrequency depolarization and oxygen-induced relaxation. RESULTS: Cine ventilation images acquired in spontaneously breathing rabbits were reconstructed with a temporal resolution of 50 milliseconds. Gas volume variations and time-to-maximum maps were obtained. The numerical model was validated in vitro and in vivo with various gas mixtures. Ventilation parameters (functional residual <b>capacity,</b> <b>tidal</b> volume, and alveolar pO 2) were extracted from the MR signal dynamics. CONCLUSIONS: Ventilation imaging can be performed at tidal volume using a simple experimental protocol, without any ventilation device or breath-hold period. Acquisition time, SNR and pO 2 decay can be optimized using the developed numerical model. Free-breathing ventilation images can be obtained without artifacts related to motion or gas flow. Lastly, parametric maps can be derived from the time-resolved ventilation images and physiological parameters extracted from the global signal dynamics...|$|R

The model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed integer programming problem with bidding decisions in the first stage, and plant operation and real-time sales in the second stage. The Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon project is taken as case study and the analysis is performed including sales in the United Kingdom (UK) day-ahead (spot) and intraday market for different power price characteristics. The largest annual energy production is estimated to 317 GWh and operational income is estimated to 15 million Great British Pounds (GBP) for current price characteristics.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of obesity on the pulmonary function of adult women. METHODS: An obese group, constituted of 20 women between 20 and 35 years old with a BMI of 35 - 49. 99 kg/m² who were non-smokers and sedentary and had no lung disease were recruited. The non-obese group consisted of 20 women between 20 and 35 years old who were sedentary and non-smokers and had no lung disease and a body mass index between 18. 5 and 24. 99 kg/m². Spirometry was performed in all subjects. The statistical analysis consisted of parametric or non-parametric tests, depending {{on the distribution of}} each variable, considering p < 0. 05 to be statistically significant. RESULTS: The obese group presented a mean age of 25. 85 ± 3. 89 years and a mean BMI of 41. 1 ± 3. 46 kg/m², and the non-obese group presented a mean age of 23. 9 ± 2. 97 years and a mean body mass index of 21. 91 ± 1. 81 kg/m². There {{were no significant differences between}} the obese group and the non-obese group as to the age, vital <b>capacity,</b> <b>tidal</b> volume, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume in one second. However, the obese group presented a greater inspiratory reserve volume (2. 44 ± 0. 47 L vs. 1. 87 ± 0. 42 L), a lower expiratory reserve volume (0. 52 ± 0. 32 L vs. 1. 15 ± 0. 32 L), and a maximal voluntary ventilation (108. 5 ± 13. 3 L/min vs. 122. 6 ± 19. 8 L/min) than the non-obese group, respectively. CONCLUSION: The alterations evidenced in the components of the vital capacity (inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume) suggest damage to the chest mechanics caused by obesity. These factors probably contributed to a reduction of the maximal voluntary ventilation.
