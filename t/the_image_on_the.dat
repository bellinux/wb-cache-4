5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} clipped to some degree. This is typical of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual {{through the rest of}} the Roman Empire. The clipping process invariably leaves the imperial portrait on the front of the coin intact, but often damages the mint mark, inscription, and <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> obverse.|$|E
5|$|Coins {{and seals}} {{from the site}} were studied. A {{particular}} circular seal cast in bronze with two headed eagle at the top {{has been identified as}} belonging to tsar John Alexander (r. 1331–1371). <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seal is stated to be a common feature of the 14th century seals, which were also made of gold and silver.|$|E

5|$|The {{matching}} rules distinguish {{sides of the}} tiles, and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others. Two ways to describe these {{matching rules}} are shown in <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right. In one form, tiles must be assembled such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge. In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hall's 1974 film Akenfield (from the 1969 book by Ronald Blythe) {{contains}} {{a scene where}} the grandfather {{as a young man}} is reaping a cornfield. He weeps when he accidentally crushes a bird's egg, an image derived from Bewick's tail-piece woodcut for the partridge. The woodcut shows a reaper with a scythe, a dead bird and its nest of a dozen eggs on the ground under the scythe, which has just lifted. George Ewart Evans used <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> title page of his 1956 book about Blaxhall (near Charsfield, on which 'Akenfield' is probably partly based).|$|E
5|$|The {{instruments}} of the Passion were sometimes split between a shield and crest {{in the form}} of an achievement of arms (Neubecker, 222). The Hyghalmen Roll (c. 1447–1455) shows Christ holding an azure shield charged with Veronica's Veil proper. The heraldry continues with the 15th century jousting helmet, which is covered by the seamless robe as a form of mantling, and the Cross, scepter (of mockery) and flagellum (whip) as crest. The banner's long red schwenkel is a mark of eminence in German heraldry, but it was omitted when this image was copied into Randle Holme's Book (c. 1464–1480). <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposing page (shown above) includes a shield quartered with the five Wounds of Christ, three jars of ointment, two rods, and the head of Judas Iscariot with a bag of money (Dennys, 97–98).|$|E
50|$|His canvases {{are made}} {{of a series of}} {{vertical}} wedges, usually three per work, painted in a realistic style on each side of <b>the</b> wedge. <b>The</b> <b>images</b> are arranged so that, when seen from one point, <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> various wedges form a realistic whole with slight breaks in the visual field. As the viewer moves in front of <b>the</b> canvas, <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> various wedges seem to move and swim.|$|R

5|$|In his 1917 piece The Tides of Manaunaun, Cowell {{introduced}} a new notation for tone clusters on the piano and other keyboard instruments. In this notation, only {{the top and bottom}} notes of a cluster, connected by a single line or a pair of lines, are represented. This developed into the solid-bar style seen in <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right. Here, the first chord—stretching two octaves from D2 to D4—is a diatonic (so-called white-note) cluster, indicated by the natural sign below the staff. The second is a pentatonic (so-called black-note) cluster, indicated by the flat sign; a sharp sign would be required if the notes showing the limit of the cluster were spelled as sharps. A chromatic cluster—black and white keys together—is shown in this method by a solid bar with no sign at all. In scoring the large, dense clusters of the solo organ work Volumina in the early 1960s, György Ligeti, using graphical notation, blocked in whole sections of the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} on 30 May 2012 that the Nobel Foundation had awarded the {{contract for the}} production of the five (Swedish) Nobel Prize medals to Svenska Medalj AB. Formerly, the Nobel Prize medals were minted by Myntverket (the Swedish Mint) from 1902 to 2010. Myntverket, Sweden's oldest company, ceased operations in 2011 after 1,017 years. In 2011, the Mint of Norway, located in Kongsberg, made the medals. The Nobel Prize medals are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation. Each medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse. The medals for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death. Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Peace Prize medal and the medal for the Economics Prize, but with a slightly different design. For instance, the laureate's name is engraved {{on the rim of the}} Economics medal. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the medals for chemistry and physics share the same design.|$|E

The Nobel Prize medals for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death (1833–1896).

The reverse sides of the Nobel Prize medals for Chemistry and Physics share the same design of Nature, as a Goddess, whose veil is held up by the Genius of Science. These medals and the ones for Physiology/Medicine and Literature were designed by Erik Lindberg in 1902.|$|E

25|$|The {{major problem}} in visual {{perception}} is that what people see {{is not simply a}} translation of retinal stimuli (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> retina).

25|$|A {{number of}} studies on the {{anatomical}} consistency of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shroud {{and the nature of}} the wounds on it have been performed, following the initial study by Yves Delage in 1902.
