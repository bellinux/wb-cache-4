The {{purpose of}} this review article is to discuss about the {{contribution}} of somatic sensation to <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> control system in quiet bipedal stance. The effect of enhanced somatosensory feedback on <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> control system is also discussed. A body of {{evidence suggests that the}} somatosensory feedbacks from the leg muscles and the soles of the feet substantially contribute to <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> equilibrium during quiet bipedal stance. An additional tactile feedback such as that from the fingertip mechanoreceptors substantially enhances <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> control system. Also, the injection of minute, optimal intensity of noise-like stimulation to the mechanoreceptors enhances <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> control system. These findings would promise the practical application of these methods for enhancing <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> control in daily life, while such effects on the dynamic equilibrium should be further examined...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Anticipatory {{adjustments}} of forearm posture {{are associated}} with a voluntary load-lifting movement in bimanual load-lifting tasks. Three aspects of these ad-justments are analyzed: their goal, their central organiza-tion, and their acquisition. The goal of the anticipatory adjustment in this task is to minimize the perturbation of forearm posture that occurs during unloading. The cen-tral organization is based on two parallel controls re-sponsible, respectively, for the lifting movement of the moving forearm and <b>the</b> anticipatory <b>postural</b> adjustment of <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> forearm, their coordination depending on a central timing signal. The acquisition of <b>the</b> anticipato-ry <b>postural</b> adjustment was tested using a paradigm where the voluntary movement performed by one hand triggered, via an electronic switch, the load release of <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> forearm. It was achieved after 40 – 60 trials and was not graded {{as a function of the}} voluntary movement parameters, but of the disturbance of <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> arm about to occur. The learned anticipation was not trans-ferred when, after a first acquisition session with one forearm as <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> forearm, a second learning ses-sion was performed with the other forearm as the postur-al forearm. The acquisition was tested in Parkinsonian and in hemiparetic patients with capsular lesion. The highest acquisition deficit was observed in hemiparetic patients, when the contralateral forearm was <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> forearm; <b>the</b> deficit was less important when the ipsilat-eral arm was <b>postural.</b> Surprisingly, <b>the</b> anticipatory pos-tural adjustments in hemiparetic patients were rather well preserved when the natural load-lifting task was tested.

40|$|Abstract. Stabilometry signals involve {{irregular}} {{and unpredictable}} components. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to investigate these signals with a nonlinear technique to examine how the complexity of <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> control system breaks down under altered visual conditions. We evaluated the dynamical similarities of <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> control system when the eyes were open or closed, or when there was optokinetic stimulation (OKS). A similarity index was calculated by the cross-correlation integral between the two dynamics: eyes open and eyes closed, or eyes open with OKS. Using this technique, dynamical changes were not observed between eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. This result suggests that the nonvision condition does not produce any striking effect on <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> control system; instead, the eyes-open condition causes a decrease in the stochastic activity of <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> control system, which may originate mainly from the stiffness of the musculoskeletal systems. In contrast, the visual input of OKS affected the dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> control system in nearly half of the subjects (group 2) despite showing no significant differences between the eyes-open condition and the other conditions for area as the conventional parameter.

In this situation, participants perceived an illusionary increase in force on <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> hand, which was, in reality, constant.

First, we showed that part of the illusion can be linked to a sensorimotor prediction [...] the predicted sensory consequences based on an efference copy of the lifting action. The illusion is reduced when the object is lifted by an external force. We also showed that the illusion changes on a trial-by-trial basis, paralleling the fast adaptation of <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> response. Second, motor errors that arise from a miscalibrated forward model do not contribute to the illusion; the illusion was unchanged even when we prevented motor errors by supporting <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> hand. Finally, visual information signaling the removal of the object is sufficient to elicit part of the illusion.

Their muscular expression is characterized by early changes in the activity of <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> muscles, before <b>the</b> movement begins. To explore the mechanisms enabling the acquisition of APAs, a learning paradigm was designed in which the voluntary lifting of a load with one hand triggered the unloading of another load suspended below the contralateral forearm. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate changes in the muscular expression that uncovers the progressive learning of new APAs. A trial-by-trial analysis of kinematic and electromyographic signals recorded on the right arm was conducted in twelve adults through six sessions of learning. Kinematic results reported an enhancement of <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> stabilization across learning. The main EMG pattern found during learning consisted of a flexor inhibition, where latency was shifted towards an earlier occurrence in parallel with the improvement of <b>the</b> <b>postural</b> performance.
