5000|$|Here is {{an example}} of how therbligs can be used to analyze motion: ...Suppose a man goes into a {{bathroom}} and shave. We'll assume that his face is all lathered and that he is ready to pick up his razor. He knows where the razor is, but first he must locate it with his eye. That is [...] "search", the first <b>Therblig.</b> His eye finds it and comes to rest -- that's [...] "find", the second <b>Therblig.</b> Third comes [...] "select", the process of sliding the razor prior to the fourth <b>Therblig,</b> [...] "grasp." [...] Fifth is [...] "transport loaded," [...] bringing the razor up to his face, and sixth is [...] "position," [...] getting the razor set on his face. There are eleven other Therbligs -- the last one is [...] "think"! Frank Gilbreth, Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey ...|$|E
50|$|The word <b>therblig</b> was the {{creation}} of Frank Bunker Gilbreth and Lillian Moller Gilbreth, American industrial psychologists who invented the field of time and motion study. It is a reversal of the name Gilbreth, with 'th' transposed.|$|E
50|$|Therbligs are 18 {{kinds of}} {{elemental}} motions {{used in the}} study of motion economy in the workplace. A workplace task is analyzed by recording each of the <b>therblig</b> units for a process, with the results used for optimization of manual labour by eliminating unneeded movements.|$|E
30|$|As we can {{see from}} the Fig.  2, a {{maintenance}} operation contains a lot of maintenance action. Oriented to the maintenance task, this paper divides maintenance work into four parts considering characteristics of MOD method: mobile <b>therbligs,</b> posture-adjustive <b>therbligs</b> and operational <b>therbligs.</b>|$|R
3000|$|According to the person’s action level, MOD method {{chooses the}} time {{consumption}} {{level of a}} finger gesture as the lowest action level, the fastest speed and the lowest energy consumption, as the unit time, which is remembered as 1 MOD. It means that finger moves, the average action time is 0.129  s, {{that is to say}} 1 MOD =  0.129  s (Ma et al. 2010). However, this conversion relation is not absolute, because different industries are not the same. In actual condition, the MOD time value can be determined according to the actual situation (Sun et al. 2009). MOD method divides human action into 21 categories including 11 basic therbilgs and 10 other auxiliary <b>therbligs.</b> 11 basic <b>therbligs</b> contain 5 mobile <b>therbligs</b> and 6 end <b>therbligs.</b> Mobiles <b>therbligs</b> mainly indicate that the position space of an object is changed by using fingers, wrists and arms; [...]...|$|R
30|$|The rest {{can be done}} in {{the same}} manner. Then we can measure all {{maintenance}} <b>therbligs</b> MOD values.|$|R
30|$|If the {{key frame}} {{contains}} class I displacement vector, class III displacement vector and class V displacement vector, {{the type of}} <b>therblig</b> is Assemble.|$|E
30|$|If the {{key frame}} {{contains}} class II displacement vector, class IV displacement vector and class VI displacement vector, {{the type of}} <b>therblig</b> is Reach.|$|E
30|$|If the {{key frame}} {{contains}} class I displacement vector, class IV displacement vector and t class VI displacement vector, {{the type of}} <b>therblig</b> is Grasp or Move.|$|E
30|$|We {{can measure}} the basic {{maintenance}} work some <b>therbligs.</b> Therefore through cumulating the maintenance <b>therbligs</b> time, the total {{time can be}} gained. The procedure of disassembling APU motor starter {{can be divided into}} 8 parts: going up the operation platform, opening seven cap locks, opening the left side cabin door, opening the right side cabin door, screwing 8 hexagon bolts, screwing APU, moving cables and putting APU to the operation platform.|$|R
3000|$|According to {{the basic}} <b>therbligs,</b> look up Table  1, {{determine}} the basic MOD value, and define it as [...] T_i.|$|R
3000|$|Add all {{maintenance}} time of each <b>therbligs,</b> the final {{maintenance time}} can be calculated as [...] T = ∑_i = 1 ^nT_i^'.|$|R
30|$|Support method, in {{reference}} to MOD method, provides the key way to measure maintenance time of each <b>therblig,</b> and the method provides the way to study influence coefficients and maintenance time measure method, which {{will be discussed in}} detail in the following section.|$|E
30|$|The observation, {{decomposition}} {{and record}} of motion are usually accomplished through artificial means {{during the process}} of motion analysis. This method not only has a heavy workload, its efficiency is also very low. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel method to segment and recognize continuous human motion automatically based on machine vision for mechanical assembly operation. First, the content-based dynamic key frame extraction technology was utilized to extract key frames from video stream, and then automatic segmentation of action was implemented. Further, the SIFT feature points of the region of interest (ROIs) were extracted, on the basis of which the characteristic vector of the key frame was derived. The feature vector can be used not only to represent the characteristic of motion, but also to describe the connection between motion and environment. Finally, the classifier is constructed based on support vector machine (SVM) to classify feature vectors, and the type of <b>therblig</b> is identified according to the classification results. Our approach enables robust <b>therblig</b> recognition in challenging situations (such as changing of light intensity, dynamic backgrounds) and allows automatic segmentation of motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves recognition rates of 96.00  % on sample video which captured on the assembly line.|$|E
30|$|Figure  9 {{shows that}} the vision-based motion {{recognition}} method can accurately identify the type of therbligs, but there are minor differences between the motion times obtained by using the proposed method and observed values. The cause of this phenomenon is that the identification object of the vision-based motion recognition method proposed in this paper is key frame, but not each frame of video stream. If two key frames A and B contain different therbligs, the time interval between them {{is the time of}} the <b>therblig</b> in key frame A. When each frame of video stream is used to recognize, the time difference in Fig.  8 would not exist. However, identifying all the frames one by one will greatly reduce timeliness and generate a large amount of redundant data during the recording. Therefore, when the time accuracy of motion analysis is not high, it is reasonable to use the key frame as the object of motion recognition.|$|E

30|$|Maintenance {{process should}} be {{decomposed}} before measuring maintenance time. Only composing all operation, {{then we can}} calculate the MOD of each <b>therbligs</b> to get the maintenance time of a maintenance event.|$|R
40|$|The {{assumption}} that vocational aptitude changed {{with age and}} {{with the kind of}} occupation was examined from the tendency of the fitted curve for the score of the aptitude test. 9 vocational aptitudes were measured by the general vocational aptitude test by Japan Labor Ministry. Subjects were 382 male workers (design engineers, turners, welders, can manufacturing workers, and crane operators) of from 20 to 59 years old, and 348 male and female students (junior high school, vocational school, and university) of from 15 to 19 years old. The design engineers' aptitudes advanced along the quadratic curve until 31 years old, but almost all the aptitudes of the other workers fell along the linear curve with age. The design engineers preserved various aptitudes until 52 years old, the turners 44, and the welders, the can manufacturing workers, and the crane operators 37. The students' aptitudes were equal to those of the workers of from 15 to 25 years old. The workers preserved Spatial aptitude and Numerical aptitude until 45 years old. This could be said in all the occupations here. Further it was made clear from the micromotion study that the influence of age was caused by <b>therblig...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to make a}} kaizen {{design at}} Welly Motor. Welly Motor is a retail shop {{as well as a}} {{distributor}} of spare parts for smaller-scale stores. In Store activities, Welly Motor have a lack awareness about opportunities for improvement in work environment. so can lead to problems in its operations and in creating customer disatisfaction. The problem that can arise is the lack of purpose and direction that make up the motivation to work, the room is not tidy, health and safety is threatened, and the lack of worker’s awareness about improvement. How to solve the problem that occurs is to devise Kaizen attitude on Welly Motor. This study used a qualitative approach and using kaizen method. Where the design is done before making framework based on the topics, concepts, and objects as the target design. Design of kaizen method consists of six steps. The first stage is finding a potential improvement by identifying things that can cause problems and can be corrected by identifying waste and existing problems. The second stage of the method used to analyze the current work unit analysis to determine the details of an activity so can be observe what things effect the activity. The third stage is had an idea to design vision and mission, 5 S, repair labor movement, as well as the separation of manual labor and machinery. The fourth stage of the formulation of the vision and mission, design 5 S (sort, set in order, shine, standardize, and sustain), improvements of the <b>therblig</b> method on labor movement, and the elimination of pending work machines (computers and printers). The fifth stage of drafting step in communicating, directing, motivating, and empowering employees to implement the design. The sixth stage is make schedule for evaluation and discussion forums and design continuous improvement from evaluation results. The benefits of this design for Welly Motor is to provide awareness of the opportunities for improvement, improve labor productivity, time efficiency, profit, health and safety, as well as gain the trust of consumers...|$|E
2500|$|Their {{emphasis}} on the [...] "one best way" [...] and <b>therbligs</b> predates the development of continuous quality improvement (CQI), and the late 20th century understanding that repeated motions can lead to workers experiencing repetitive motion injuries.|$|R
30|$|After we get {{the basic}} MOD value, {{the next step is}} {{correcting}} MOD value considering the influence coefficients of visibility, workspace and human posture. Taking a screw MTP as an example, the one of the maintenance <b>therbligs</b> is shown in Fig.  13.|$|R
30|$|Support data is {{the data}} for {{research}} which are maintenance procedure, human model and ergonomics data. Maintenance procedure and human model are the basis to decompose the maintenance task into <b>therbligs.</b> Ergonomics data is used to study several impact factors which lead to the difference of the maintenance time between the actual maintenance work and simulation process.|$|R
30|$|Measuring {{maintenance}} time by MOD method regards human action as the core, so the decomposition of the maintenance task {{is the first}} step (Adams and Shoemaker 1989). Then maintenance personnel can portray maintenance actions particularly in virtual simulation environment and judges the MOD values of maintenance <b>therbligs.</b> Considering the influence of visibility, workspace and human posture, specific MOD value should be corrected. The final {{maintenance time}} can be got by adding up all maintenance MOD values.|$|R

40|$|To improve energy efficiency, {{extensive}} {{studies have}} focused on the cutting parameters optimization in the machining process. Actually, non-cutting activities (NCA) occur frequently during machining and this is a promising way to save energy through optimizing NCA without changing the cutting parameters. However, it is difficult for the existing methods to accurately determine and reduce the energy wastes (EW) in NCA. To fill this gap, a novel Therblig-embedded Value Stream Mapping (TVSM) method is proposed to improve the energy transparency and clearly show and reduce the EW in NCA. The Future-State-Map (FSM) of TVSM can be built by minimizing non-cutting activities and <b>Therbligs.</b> By implementing the FSM, time and energy efficiencies can be improved without decreasing the machining quality, which is consistent with the goal of lean energy machining. The method is validated by a machining case study, the results show that the total energy is reduced by 7. 65 %, and the time efficiency of the value-added activities is improved by 8. 12 %, and the energy efficiency of value-added activities and <b>Therbligs</b> are raised by 4. 95 % and 1. 58 %, respectively. This approach can be applied to reduce the EW of NCA, to support designers to design high energy efficiency machining processes during process planning...|$|R

According to Claude George (1968), Gilbreth reduced all motions of the hand into some combination of 17 basic motions. These included grasp, transport loaded, and hold.

He used a motion picture camera that was calibrated in fractions of minutes to time the smallest of motions in workers.|$|R
30|$|An {{efficient}} {{maintenance time}} measurement methodology {{plays an important}} role in early stage of the maintainability design. While traditional way to measure the maintenance time ignores the differences between line production and maintenance action. This paper proposes a corrective MOD method considering several important ergonomics factors to predict the maintenance time. With the help of the DELMIA analysis tools, the influence coefficient of several factors are discussed to correct the MOD value and the designers can measure maintenance time by calculating the sum of the corrective MOD time of each maintenance <b>therbligs.</b> Finally a case study is introduced, by maintaining the virtual prototype of APU motor starter in DELMIA, designer obtains the actual maintenance time by the proposed method, and the result verifies the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Industrial {{operations}} {{are becoming more}} mechanized and automated. The increasing complexity of work affects the proportion of physical to mental effort which workers spend {{in the performance of}} their jobs. Traditional work measurement techniques which are primarily designed to measure the individual's physical load have to be complemented with other techniques to evaluate his mental load. This study is aimed at developing a methodology which {{can be applied to the}} analysis and measurement of the mental contribution of workers and its associated effects. Information Theory and the Theory of Communication are used to provide a conceptual framework in which information processes employed in the performance of industrial tasks are identified and evaluated. Depending on their complexity, the various information processes called mental <b>therbligs,</b> are classified according to four levels of integrative behavior. Information processing rates are calculated on the basis of the amount of information transmitted in the performance of these <b>therbligs.</b> Average and, where possible, peak rates are obtained for typical jobs representing two or more technological levels in four different segments of the forest products industry: a. Lumber Sorting b. Lumber Grading c. Groundwood Pulp Production, and d. Sulfate (Kraft) Pulp Production. Thus, the mental content of jobs in each of these industry segments is evaluated. The mental contribution of industrial workers is then analyzed in terms of some of the following: 1. The effects of the repetition cycle rate and the variability of the tasks' sequence. 2. The effects of increased system complexity on the ability of operators to cope with the high informational load, equipment malfunctions and emergency situations. 3. The effects of increased system entropy on the operator's speed. of responses and on the requirements of system design. 4. The effects of the addition of a process control computer on the variability of the process parameters and on the operator's mental load. 5. The implications regarding training and compensation of workers slated for the jobs created by new technology...|$|R
3000|$|Maintainability is product’s {{ability to}} {{maintain}} and restore condition according to prescribed procedures and methods to repair under the stated conditions for a given period of time. The prescribed time limit to complete maintenance work is metric to measure good degree of product’s maintainability, which influences {{the availability of the}} product directly and influences the combat readiness. For example, in military fields, good maintainability will reduce the downtime caused by maintenance, improve the executing ability of equipment to increase combat efficiency, and also in the field of manufacturing, downtime of product line caused by maintenance will cause great loss, but now there isn’t a useful method to measure the maintenance time in the design stage to verify if the maintenance time can meet maintainability requirement, while traditional way rely on statistic data in the physical prototypes in the later stage, which is lagged, and modifies the design is very difficult. To predict actual maintenance time in the design phase, this paper presents a method for measuring the actual maintenance time through virtual maintenance process simulation for complex product system. Considering unique features of the maintenance, this paper proposes a corrective MOD method to measure time, because VR still exist difference from the reality, it is difficult to simulate the adjustment process of the maintenance personnel, considering the some influence factors such as workspace, visibility and human posture that influence the maintenance operation, this paper modifies the initial maintenance time of each <b>therbligs</b> got from the virtual simulation.

40|$|Programming robots {{by human}} {{demonstration}} is an intuitive approach, especially by gestures. Because robot pick-and-place tasks {{are widely used}} in industrial factories, this paper proposes a framework to learn robot pick-and place tasks by understanding human hand gestures. The proposed framework is composed of the module of gesture recognition and the module of robot behaviour control. For the module of gesture recognition, transport empty (TE), transport loaded (TL), grasp (G), and release (RL) from Gilbreth’s <b>therbligs</b> are the hand gestures to be recognized. A convolution neural network (CNN) is adopted to recognize these gestures from a camera image. To achieve the robust performance, the skin model by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to filter out non-skin colours of an image, and the calibration of position and orientation is applied to obtain the neutral hand pose before the training and testing of the CNN. For the module of robot behaviour control, the corresponding robot motion primitives to TE, TL, G, and RL, respectively, are implemented in the robot. To manage the primitives in the robot system, a behaviour-based programming platform based on the Extensible Agent Behavior Specification Language (XABSL) is adopted. Because the XABSL provides the flexibility and re-usability of the robot primitives, the hand motion sequence from the module of gesture recognition can be easily used in the XABSL programming platform to implement the robot pick-and-place tasks. The experimental evaluation of seven subjects performing seven hand gestures showed that the average recognition rate was 95. 96 %. Moreover, by the XABSL programming platform, the experiment showed the cube-stacking task was easily programmed by human demonstration...|$|R
