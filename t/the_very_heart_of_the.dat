5|$|The Phra Maha Monthien (พระมหามณเฑียร) {{group of}} {{buildings}} are located roughly at {{the centre of the}} Middle Court, therefore at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grand Palace itself. The traditional Thai style building group is enclosed by a low wall, as this was once the residential and sleeping abode of kings. Thus it is considered the most important set of throne halls in the entire Grand Palace. All of the buildings within the Maha Monthien face north and are arranged from front to back with the public reception hall being at the front, ceremonial halls in the middle and residential halls at the back, all of them inter-connected to each other.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Puerto Rico, in January 1521, he {{received}} the terrible news that the Dominican convent at Chiribichi had been sacked by Indians, and that the Spaniards of the islands had launched a punitive expedition, led by Gonzalo de Ocampo, into <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territory that Las Casas wanted to colonize peacefully. The Indians had been provoked to attack the settlement of the monks because of the repeated slave raids by Spaniards operating from Cubagua. As Ocampo's ships began returning with slaves from the land Las Casas had been granted, he went to Hispaniola to complain to the Audiencia. After several months of negotiations Las Casas set sail alone; the peasants he had brought had deserted, and he arrived in his colony already ravaged by Spaniards.|$|E

After {{talking with}} Dagoth Ur, who {{attempts}} to sway the player {{to his side}} with the claim that he is merely following Nerevar's final orders, the player and Dagoth Ur fight. Besting Dagoth Ur, the Nerevarine soon discovers that while the Heart of Lorkhan is still intact, Dagoth Ur remains immortal and he soon returns from death. Making his way to <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain, the Nerevarine finds the Heart of Lorkhan and destroys it, severing Dagoth Ur from his power and ultimately killing him. Akulakhan's Chamber, where Lorkhan's heart resided, is destroyed in the process as the cavern collapses, and in turn Red Mountain is cleared of blight and The Sixth House falls. Upon escaping from the chamber, the Nerevarine is congratulated by Azura, who comes to reward the player's efforts of fulfilling the prophecy.|$|E

25|$|From the start, the régime faced {{numerous}} problems. The Turks of Asia Minor {{had since}} 1263 been raiding and expanding into Byzantine territory in Asia Minor. Anatolia, which had formed <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shrinking empire, was systematically lost to numerous Turkic ghazis, whose raids evolved into conquering expeditions inspired by Islamic zeal. With a decreasing {{source of food}} and manpower, the Palaiologoi were forced to fight on several fronts, most of them being Christian states: the Second Bulgarian Empire, the Serbian Empire, {{the remnants of the}} Latin Empire and even the Knights Hospitaller.|$|E

The Løgting's archives for the period from 1852 to the present also provide the most important source of information on the more recent and latest political history of the Faroes.

500|$|Dejan {{received}} {{the title of}} despot sometime after August 1355, either from Emperor Dušan, who died on 20 December 1355, or from his heir Uroš V, most likely the latter. During the rule of Uroš V, Dejan was entrusted with {{the administration of the}} territory between South Morava, Pčinja, Skopska Crna Gora (his hereditary lands) and in the east, Upper Struma river with Velbužd (Kyustendil), a province notably larger than he had possessed during Dušan's life. This province was located in <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, and the important Via de Zenta, a trade route connecting the Adriatic with the interior of the Balkans, crossed it. [...] As the only despot, Dejan held the highest title in the Empire (this had earlier been the veliki vojvoda, Jovan Oliver). Dejan's daughter Teodora married Žarko, the lord of Lower Zeta, in 1356.|$|E
500|$|The Rashtrakuta kings {{supported}} the popular religions {{of the day}} in the traditional spirit of religious tolerance. Scholars have offered various arguments regarding which specific religion the Rashtrakutas favoured, basing their evidence on inscriptions, coins and contemporary literature. Some claim the Rashtrakutas were inclined towards Jainism since many of the scholars who flourished in their courts and wrote in Sanskrit, Kannada and a few in Apabhramsha and Prakrit were Jains. The Rashtrakutas built well-known Jain temples at locations such as Lokapura in Bagalkot district and their loyal feudatory, the Western Ganga Dynasty, built Jain monuments at Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. Scholars have suggested that Jainism was a principal religion at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empire, modern Karnataka, accounting for more than 30% of the population and dominating the culture of the region. King Amoghavarsha I was a disciple of the Jain acharya Jinasena and wrote in his religious writing, Prashnottara Ratnamalika, [...] "having bowed to Varaddhamana (Mahavira), I write Prashnottara Ratnamalika". The mathematician Mahaviracharya wrote in his Ganita Sarasangraha, [...] "The subjects under Amoghavarsha are happy and the land yields plenty of grain. May the kingdom of King Nripatunga Amoghavarsha, follower of Jainism ever increase far and wide." [...] Amoghavarsha may have taken up Jainism in his old age.|$|E
