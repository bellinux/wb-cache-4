5000|$|The {{conscience}} clause {{is widely}} invoked in Catholic universities, hospitals, and agencies because the Catholic Church opposes abortion, contraceptives, sterilization, and {{embryonic stem cell}} treatments. Opponents of related FOCA legislation have interpreted the possible end of the conscience clause as a demand to either [...] "do abortions or close." [...] Archbishop Dolan has said, [...] "“In effect, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> we have a year {{to figure out how}} to violate our consciences." [...] However, conscience clauses are sometimes interpreted differently and their use will often depend on the given context.|$|E

50|$|In 1967, Mackin {{became one}} of the {{earliest}} women to receive a Nieman Fellowship to Harvard University, where she studied the history of political institutions. Hired by NBC in 1969, she anchored a half-hour newscast at WRC-TV, the Washington affiliate of NBC, in addition to her reporting responsibilities. Mackin received national attention three years later when she became that network's first woman floor reporter at the Democratic and Republican presidential conventions. Her work contributed to the subsequent award of an Emmy to the NBC news team for its coverage. Her report later that year on President Nixon's re-election campaign, in which she stated that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> things about opponent George McGovern that were untrue, was highlighted in Timothy Crouse's book, The Boys on the Bus. After a stint in Los Angeles, Mackin returned to Washington D.C., to become the Sunday evening anchor and congressional correspondent in 1974.|$|R

A computer instantly processed the evaluations of each voter and plotted the average on a graph. The verdict: the panel did not like what <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b> As Bush tried to defend his conduct in the campaign, the summary graph dipped sharply below the neutral midpoint of the scale and remained there while he spoke on this topic...|$|R

5000|$|Levin was {{an early}} {{opponent}} of using U.S. military force in Iraq, saying in August 2002 that [...] "if Saddam Hussein {{had weapons of mass}} destruction, he wouldn't use them," [...] and that [...] "he's a survivalist, not a suicide bomber". Levin proposed the failed Multilateral Use of Force Authorization Act, {{as an alternative to the}} Iraq Resolution, pushing President George W. Bush to build an international coalition in conjunction with the United Nations, so that [...] "Saddam will be looking down the barrel of a gun, with the world at the other end rather than just the United States." [...] Levin was one of 23 Senators who voted against the Iraq Resolution, saying that [...] "If we are going to take on Saddam at some point, it is critical that we have the world with us, that there be a U.N. resolve that authorizes war, because the consequences are very, very severe. If we go without a declaration from the U.N. it is far better to have one, and that means that we've got to bring the world along here." [...] Levin has strongly argued that the War in Iraq was a diversion from the War on Terror. On CNN on November 14, 2005, Levin said that [...] "before <b>the</b> war, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> that you cannot distinguish between Saddam Hussein and Iraq. As a matter of fact, he said that so often that he tried to connect Saddam Hussein with the attackers on us, on 9/11, so often, so frequently and so successfully, even though it was wrong, that the American people overwhelmingly thought, because of <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> misstatements that as a matter of fact, Saddam Hussein had participated in the attack on us on 9/11. That was a deception. That was clearly misinformation. It had a huge effect on the American people." ...|$|R

60|$|The episode {{would have}} been funny if the matter at stake had been a trifle; but in the {{circumstances}} it was pathetic. The usual storm was raging in the House. As usual, many of the Majority and {{the most of the}} Minority were standing up--to have a better chance to exchange epithets and make other noises. Into this storm Count Falkenhayn entered, with his paper in his hand; and at once there was a rush to get near him and hear him read his motion. In a moment he was walled in by listeners. The several clauses of his motion were loudly applauded by these allies, and as loudly disapplauded--if I may invent a word--by such of the Opposition as could hear his voice. When he took his seat <b>the</b> <b>President</b> promptly put <b>the</b> motion--persons desiring to vote in the affirmative, stand up! The House was already standing up; had been standing for an hour; and before a third of it had found out what <b>the</b> <b>President</b> had <b>been</b> <b>saying,</b> he had proclaimed the adoption of the motion! And only a few heard that. In fact, when that House is legislating you can't tell it from artillery practice.|$|R
5000|$|Pandas {{have become}} {{important}} diplomatic symbols, {{not only to}} China. In a visit by Hu Jintao to Japan in May 2008, China announced the loan of two pandas to Japan. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>was</b> quoted as <b>saying</b> [...] "Giant pandas are very popular among the Japanese, {{and they are a}} symbol of the friendly ties between Japan and China." [...] Actions that other countries take with pandas are often seen as laden with meaning. For example, British diplomats worried that a 1964 transfer of a panda from a London zoo to Moscow would worsen Sino-Soviet relations. [...] In January 2006, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick was photographed hugging a 5-month-old panda cub during his visit to Sichuan Province. The image was widely broadcast by the Chinese media and was purportedly interpreted as a sign that Zoellick supported better relations between China and the United States.|$|R

At that time, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> quoted as <b>saying</b> of the co-chairs: [...] "They have my full support to follow the facts wherever they lead, without fear or favor." [...] Appearing on the Diane Rehm Show the same day, congressman Ed Markey (D-MA) responded to the suggestion that an oil industry representative be appointed to the commission by pointing to Republican Reilly's position with Conoco. The suggestion had been forwarded by John Breaux, former Democratic U.S. senator from Louisiana and lobbyist more recently for among others Shell Oil Company. [...] Markey also opined that Congress ought to give subpoena power to the commission.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of July 14, {{advancing}} Union skirmishers found that the entrenchments were empty. Cavalry under Buford and Kilpatrick attacked the rearguard of Lee's army, Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division, which was still on a ridge about [...] from Falling Waters. The initial attack caught the Confederates by surprise after a long night with little sleep, and hand-to-hand fighting ensued. Kilpatrick attacked again and Buford struck them in their right and rear. Heth's and Pender's divisions lost numerous prisoners. Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew, who had survived Pickett's Charge with a minor hand wound, was mortally wounded at Falling Waters. This minor success against Heth did not {{make up for the}} extreme frustration in the Lincoln administration about allowing Lee to escape. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>was</b> quoted as <b>saying,</b> [...] "We had them within our grasp.
