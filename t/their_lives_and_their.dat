500|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil crisis, the 1979 energy crisis, and the {{resulting}} rise in oil prices, experimental designs using coal to fuel ships were tested in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

500|$|Ritvo {{then moved}} Mucho Macho Man to Santa Anita Park {{almost two months}} before the Breeders' Cup races because she felt he [...] "thrived" [...] in California. It was a major {{commitment}} for the horse's team, as Ritvo, Green, Petro, Tapia and Lopez had to leave their home base in Florida, and Reeves had to cover the expenses. Dean Reeves said, [...] "Everybody has basically put <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> family second to the benefit and {{the best we can do}} for Macho." [...] The horse's next race was the Awesome Again Stakes at Santa Anita on September 28. [...] Because both Smith and Prado had prior riding commitments, Ritvo and Green decided to contact Gary Stevens. Stevens' contribution to the human interest saga included a comeback in 2013 after having been forced to retire seven years earlier due to debilitating knee pain. He also had his own near-death experience, having survived a major riding accident in 2003. [...] In a twist of serendipity, Stevens' agent, Craig O'Brien, came by the barn to inquire about the horse's availability about the same time Ritvo and Green had decided to see if Stevens was available. Stevens later claimed to be unaware of his agent's machinations. Noting that Stevens had portrayed Seabiscuit's jockey George Woolf in the eponymous film, Ritvo later joked, [...] "I was in Hollywood. How could I not use a film star?" [...] In the course of the Awesome Again, Mucho Macho Man settled behind the leaders before making a bid on the final turn. The horse led by three lengths in the homestretch, and accelerated clear of the field to win easily by [...] lengths over Paynter. It was his first win in 2013 and his first Grade I stakes win. [...] The victory was also a [...] "win and you're in" [...] qualifying race for the Breeders' Cup Classic, which included a waiver of the $100,000 entry fee for the Classic.|$|E
