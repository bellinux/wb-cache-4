5|$|The 42nd Division {{entered the}} line in the quiet Lunéville sector in February 1918. On 26 February, MacArthur and Captain Thomas T. Handy {{accompanied}} a French trench raid in which MacArthur assisted in the capture of a number of German prisoners. The commander of the French VII Corps, Major General Georges de Bazelaire, decorated MacArthur with the Croix de guerre. Menoher recommended MacArthur for a Silver Star, which he later received. The Silver Star Medal was not instituted until 8 August 1932, but small Silver Citation Stars were authorized to be worn on the campaign ribbons of those cited in orders for gallantry, similar to the British mention in despatches. When the Silver Star Medal was instituted, it was retroactively awarded to those who had been awarded Silver Citation Stars. On 9 March, the 42nd Division launched three raids of its own on German trenches in the Salient du Feys. MacArthur accompanied a company of the 168th Infantry. This time, his leadership was rewarded with the Distinguished Service Cross. A few days later, MacArthur, who was strict about his men carrying their gas masks but often neglected to bring his own, was gassed. He recovered in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> Secretary Baker around the area on 19 March.|$|E
500|$|The first promotional artwork {{features}} Gaga naked with moss {{covering her}} genitals. The single's official cover art {{was released on}} October 21, showing Gaga's backside, wearing a floral thong. The cover art was shot by photographer Terry Richardson. In an interview with German television station ProSieben, Gaga explained that the explicit imagery for the cover art {{was due to the}} constant criticism and discussion surrounding her, adding that [...] "When I look at how society has changed, I feel like this is a good <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> you my ass, because it's all I choose to give you." ...|$|E
500|$|Pekka and Antti {{took turns}} {{recording}} their rhythm and lead guitar parts, respectively. Both guitarists played by striking the guitar strings at a 45-degree angle {{to achieve a}} more aggressive sound. Several of the guitar techniques used on the album had specific names: [...] "Jynkhä" [...] described the rapid succession of downstrokes, and a slower version of this technique was called [...] "perusjynkhä." [...] Speed-picking with alternating upstrokes and downstrokes {{was referred to as}} [...] "hionta", Finnish for [...] Some of the techniques used were difficult for Pekka, and his brother Antti took the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> him proper fingering and grasps.|$|E

500|$|Once Texas {{switched}} to the zone read offense, they quickly started gaining yards and points. Charles ran for a career-high 290yards, including 216yards and threelong touchdown runs in the fourthquarter. [...] His tally also set a new record for rushing against the Cornhuskers, surpassing the old record of 247yards by Oklahoma’s Billy Simms. [...] Charles explained [...] "It was my <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> everyone what I can do. [...] When I saw a hole, I blasted through it." [...] Texas finished with 181yards passing and 364yards rushing; Nebraska had 315yards passing and 132yards rushing. [...] The running back was named the Walter Camp Football Foundation National Offensive Player of the Week.|$|E
500|$|It {{became evident}} {{by the third}} day of {{production}} that the episode was going to run significantly short, partly caused by the time-efficient filming style. The scene in which Daniel informs Jack and Teal'c of the opportunity to do whatever they like, was a late pitch by Brad Wright, who had also had the idea for some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> someone golfing through the Stargate. Preliminary discussions about computer-generating the golf ball to not break the US$100,000 Stargate prop were later overturned, and the actors used a real golf ball. Many of the other humorous scenes in [...] "Window of Opportunity" [...] were improvised on set during filming. With juggling being one of Richard Dean Anderson's earlier careers, director Peter DeLuise filmed the juggling sequence in a last effort to fill the episode's time slot. [...] "Window of Opportunity" [...] has no deleted scenes.|$|E
500|$|A {{sneak preview}} of the series aired on November 26, 2016. Mike Richards, {{executive}} producer of The Price Is Right and Let's Make a Deal and former host of GSN's The Pyramid, was chosen to host the show, and the series officially premiered January 19, 2017, {{an hour before the}} season four premiere of GSN's Idiotest. When asked about choosing the premiere date for the show, GSN’s Executive Vice President of Programming, Amy Introcaso-Davis, said [...] "Divided is informed by the fractured social landscape, which in turn, reflects the political divide in this country....launching Divided so close to the inauguration, much like a question in the show, was hotly debated! Ultimately we agreed it was a good <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that although people have many disagreements, it is to everyone’s benefit to unite." [...] On March 14, 2017, GSN renewed Divided for a second season, with a two-episode premiere on August 15, 2017. On March 30, 2017, a special edition of the show aired with three contestants instead of the usual four, resembling the format on the original British series. During this episode, no mid-game elimination was held.|$|E

2500|$|Around {{the time}} Mudge came to Columbia, the American Library Association {{asked her to}} update Guide to Reference Books, which was desperately needing a {{supplement}} {{to go along with}} the original edition.

2500|$|In [...] "Accelerate", Entity FX {{was able}} to create a visual effect of Clark superspeeding through the rain—something Gough and Millar had wanted to see since season one—that {{eventually}} won them a Visual Effects Society award. Gough and Millar had always wanted to see Clark superspeeding through a rain shower, but [...] "the opportunity, [...] money" [...] never presented itself, until now. Entity FX had {{an extended period of time}} to research the kinetics of the cemetery scene, where Clark would speed through rain drops, because there were limited effects done for the episodes [...] "Precipice" [...] and [...] "Witness". Using HoudiniTM, Mat Beck and his team began creating their digital raindrops: [...] "Each raindrop can be thought of as a lens, as a mirror, and an object in itself. The entire backdrop is refracted through it like a lens, and the area behind the camera is being reflected in it. By adjusting those parameters, we were able to give it a brilliant jewel-like magical quality." [...] When trying to decide on the shape of the raindrops, Beck explains: [...] "We figured that round drops weren't that interesting, and teardrop ones looked a little silly and over the top, so we settled on this round diamond shape." [...] Entity FX created [...] "collision events" [...] as Clark ran through the raindrops, breaking them up. Beck remembered watching the cars on the freeway, during a rainstorm, [...] "throwing up these loose trails of spray". Eli Jarra added a similar mist trail to Clark as he ran through the cemetery to give a more realistic effect, although Beck admits to taking a few liberties with the final look of the mist. Occasionally, Mat Beck and his team have to stretch the limits of the realistic physics they try and create when illustrating Clark’s abilities. While creating the alley scene in [...] "Prodigal" [...] where Lucas Luthor is attacked by an assassin with an Uzi 9mm, Mat Beck had to [...] "cheat" [...] the realism on the special effects used. First, the length of the alley is exaggerated in order to create enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> Clark stopping the bullets from hitting Lucas. Based on the calculations of how fast an Uzi 9mm fires, and the muzzle velocity, they estimated that the bullets would be approximately twenty to thirty feet apart; four alleys would have been needed for Clark to catch up to all of the bullets in time. Second, the bullets themselves were enlarged so that audiences would be able to see them.|$|E
