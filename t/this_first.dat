The musical score of the film, written by Alberto Urdaneta Forero, is also in this issue.|$|E
5|$|Around 01:00 on August 27, the British {{approached}} {{the vicinity of}} the Red Lion with 200–300 troops. The American troops fired upon the British; after approximately two fusillades, they fled up the Gowanus Road toward the Vechte-Cortelyou House. Major Edward Burd had been in command, but he was captured along with a lieutenant and 15 privates. <b>This</b> <b>first</b> engagement was fought in the vicinity of 38th and 39th streets between 2nd and 3rd avenues near a swamp located adjacent to the Gowanus Road.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Grand Central was completed, {{passenger}} trains approached the terminal by crossing the Chicago River {{to the southwest}} over a bridge between Taylor Street and Roosevelt Road, constructed in 1885. <b>This</b> <b>first</b> bridge {{was replaced by a}} taller structure in 1901 to accommodate larger boats and ships on the south branch of the river.|$|E

5|$|By 1807, further {{investigation}} revealed two new {{objects in the}} region: Juno and Vesta. The burning of Lilienthal in the Napoleonic wars, where {{the main body of}} work had been done, brought <b>this</b> <b>first</b> period of discovery to a close.|$|E
5|$|Catalysis is {{performed}} in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen {{to accept an}} electron, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an oxanion hole within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting {{the first half of}} the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The ejection of <b>this</b> <b>first</b> leaving group is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.|$|E
5|$|Darlington's highest league finish was fifteenth in the Football League Second Division, {{during the}} 1925–26 season. The club's best {{performance}} in the FA Cup has been two appearances in the last 16 of the competition. <b>This</b> <b>first</b> was in 1910–11, when they lost to Swindon Town in the third round. The second was in the 1957–58 season, when they beat Chelsea 4–1 in a replay to reach the fifth round, in which they lost 6–1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. The club's best League Cup performance was reaching the quarter-final in the 1967–68 season.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{this loss}} of sponsorship, Davies {{completed}} his studies and graduated in 1913. His plans to enter the ministry were abandoned; he was {{an active member of}} the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and his religious vocation had been replaced by a commitment to working-class politics. In 1913, while still a student, he stood for election to Cardiff's Board of Guardians, as the ILP candidate in the Grangetown ward. <b>This</b> <b>first</b> foray into electoral politics ended in a narrow defeat, by 47 votes.|$|E

5|$|For {{nearly a}} decade, no new {{construction}} took place.

Following completion of <b>this</b> <b>first</b> contract, a second contract was awarded for the remaining distance north to Century Road (Regional Road8).|$|E

She tells him that she is Jimson's younger sister, but his agitation is overshadowed by love and he decides to continue their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Numismatic author Dean Albanese {{considers}} the legend that Washington provided the gold {{for the first}} 400 eagles to be improbable; holding $4,000 in coin would have tied up much of Washington's capital in unproductive cash. Albanese suggests that as many surviving 1795 eagles are found with little wear, Washington may have had the government purchase pieces to give to dignitaries. By some reports, one eagle was presented to Washington, though whether it was from <b>this</b> <b>first</b> coinage is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|On May 17, 1898, {{the flag}} was {{delivered}} personally by Agoncillo and was packed {{among the things}} Aguinaldo brought back to Manila.

However, she did not witness either <b>this</b> <b>first</b> public display of the flag or the time when the flag was unfurled during the Malolos Congress because her husband remained in Hong Kong and she remained with him.|$|E
