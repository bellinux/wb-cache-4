5|$|Filming {{began in}} early August 2015, during the wet season, in the Idukki {{district}} of Kerala. Major {{portions of the}} film were shot in Thopramkudy, near Kattappana. In September, while filming in Cheruthoni, Faasil sustained a leg injury while performing a stunt with co-star Sujith Shanker. Although a two-day rest was advised, he decided <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>on</b> because of the tight shooting schedule. The filming in Idukki, which took 45 days, was wrapped up in late October.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, unbeknown {{to their}} commanders and each other, and having lost communications, the seven landing craft {{that had been}} {{reported}} missing made for their assigned beaches, determined <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>on</b> with the attack. In the end two parties landed, one party consisting of six craft carrying approximately 120 men under Captain R.L Willis landed on the beach opposite Le Petit Berneval {{to the east of}} the battery—Yellow I—while the other, consisting of only one craft of 20 men from No. 6 Troop under Captain Peter Young landed to the west at Yellow II.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the strong}} {{resistance}} {{exhibited by the}} Chinese, the Canadians expected a tough fight as 25th Brigade prepared to assault its objectives {{as part of the}} second phase of the divisional plan. Yet with the loss of Hill 355 and 210 the Chinese unexpectedly withdrew from their well-prepared defensive positions, with Hill 159 and 175 captured without opposition. Only the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry encountered any opposition before they captured the two Hill 187 features, losing one killed and six wounded during stiff fighting in which 28 Chinese were also killed. Indeed, the ease with which the Canadians had captured their initial objectives allowed them <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>on,</b> attaining their final objectives on the Jamestown Line by nightfall. No further resistance was encountered, although heavy Chinese artillery fire caused a number of casualties, including three killed. The Canadians subsequently occupied the positions they were destined to hold for the next twenty-two months of fighting.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 863, Umar struck again, joining forces with the Abbasid general Ja'far ibn Dinar al-Khayyat (probably the {{governor}} of Tarsus) for a successful raid into Cappadocia. The Arabs crossed the Cilician Gates into Byzantine territory, plundering as they went, until they reached a place near Tyana. There, the Tarsian army returned home, but Umar obtained Ja'far's leave <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>on</b> into Asia Minor. Umar's forces represented {{the bulk of his}} emirate's strength, but their size is unknown: the contemporary Muslim historian Ya'qubi claims that Umar had 8,000 men at his disposal, while the Byzantine historians Genesius and Theophanes Continuatus inflate the numbers of the Arab army to 40,000 men. The Byzantinist John Haldon considers the former number to be closer to reality, and estimates the size of the combined Arab force at 15,000–20,000 men. It is likely that a Paulician contingent under Karbeas was present as well.|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{moved his}} {{headquarters}} to Hollandia in May 1944. The swampy area with its restricted anchorages proved unsuitable {{for a major}} airbase complex, although fighter strips were constructed, and it was developed as a staging area. MacArthur was compelled <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>on</b> with the Wakde-Sarmi project lest his troops become stranded without adequate air cover. A shortage of shipping meant that the operation had {{to be carried out}} by the troops in the Hollandia area, so Krueger nominated the 163rd Regimental Combat Team for Wakde, {{while the rest of the}} 41st Infantry Division captured Sarmi. However, with only days to go, doubts surfaced about the viability of construction in the Sarmi area, and Biak was substituted. In view of the difficulties involved in changing plans, and moving the troops around, MacArthur agreed to postpone both operations, Wakde until 17 May and Biak to 27 May.|$|E

5|$|The steady {{increase}} in traffic encouraged the trustees <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>on</b> with improvements. Witton Brook was widened in 1788, and the lock was raised, but subsidence {{caused by the}} salt mining resulted in a new lock being needed in 1826. A longer-term solution {{was provided by the}} decision to move Northwich lock to a new site below the town. When the work was finished in 1829, Witton Brook lock was no longer necessary, and was removed. New cuts and locks were built through the 1790s at Vale Royal, Newbridge, Hartford and Hunts, and Butty Meadow lock was removed. In response to petitions, the construction of a towing path suitable for horses was started in 1792, and was completed as far as Anderton by mid-1793. It was later extended to Winsford, and bow-hauling of boats by men was ended.|$|E
5|$|When he {{returned}} to Berkeley, Lawrence mobilized his team to go painstakingly over the results to gather enough evidence to convince Chadwick. Meanwhile, at the Cavendish laboratory, Rutherford and Mark Oliphant found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3, which causes {{the effect that the}} cyclotroneers had observed. Not only was Chadwick correct in that they had been observing contamination, but they had overlooked yet another important discovery, that of nuclear fusion. Lawrence's response was <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>on</b> with the creation of still larger cyclotrons. The 27-inch cyclotron was superseded by a 37-inch cyclotron in June 1937, which in turn was superseded by a 60-inch cyclotron in May 1939. It was used to bombard iron and produced its first radioactive isotopes in June.|$|E
5|$|While Rokossovsky's Central Front {{continued}} its offensive against the German Second Army, which had by now been substantially reinforced with fresh divisions, the renewed German offensive towards Kharkov took it by surprise. On 7 March, Manstein {{made the decision}} <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>on</b> towards Kharkov, despite {{the coming of the}} spring thaw. Instead of attacking east of Kharkov, however, Manstein decided to orient the attack towards the west of Kharkov and then encircle it from the north. The Großdeutschland Panzergrenadier Division had also returned to the front, and threw its weight into the attack, threatening to split the 69th Army and the remnants of the 3rd Tank Army. Between 8–9 March, the SS Panzer Corps completed its drive north, splitting the 69th and 40th Soviet Armies, and on 9 March it turned east to complete its encirclement. Despite attempts by the Stavka to curtail the German advance by throwing in the freshly released 19th Rifle Division and 186th Tank Brigade, the German drive continued.|$|E

5|$|Arnold {{returned}} to {{working on the}} hydrogen bomb book, but 1987 was the 30th anniversary of the Windscale accident. Rather than let {{the records of the}} accident and subsequent inquiries be released over several years, Arnold persuaded the Public Records Office to release them all at once. In meetings with the various responsible government agencies, the topic of a book about Windscale came up, and Arnold decided to write one, which became Windscale 1957: Anatomy of a Nuclear Accident in 1992. Gowing, in poor health, retired from the UKAEA in 1993. By this time her two research assistants had also left, and Arnold feared that the UKAEA Council would shut down the hydrogen bomb book project, which she hoped to follow up with one on the UK civil nuclear power programme. The UKAEA Council decided <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>on</b> with the project, asking Arnold to stay on although she was now over seventy years old. In 1993, she was joined by Katherine Pyne, an aircraft engineer working on a history degree, who became her research assistant for two years. However, the end was in sight. The UKAEA no longer had responsibility for nuclear weapons, and management was not interested in it. With funds for the project almost exhausted, the UKAEA Council decided that Arnold should retire in 1996. She loaded her notes into her car and took them home. Sympathetic friends at the Ministry of Defence found some money to cover her expenses, and she doggedly worked on it from home. Britain and the H-Bomb finally appeared in 2001.|$|E
5|$|He {{was posted}} to 1/13th (County of London) Battalion on 25 February 1915, and joined them in France {{just over a}} week later. Lee participated in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in mid-March, an Allied {{offensive}} to regain the French village of Neuve-Chapelle. The village was retaken from the Germans, but the plan <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>on</b> and also capture Aubers was abandoned. Following this attack, the Germans heavily refortified the area and were expecting further attacks. The battle, {{part of a larger}} offensive known as the Battle of Aubers Ridge, commenced on 9 May. The Kensingtons formed part of 25th Brigade, and were one of the lead infantry units in the northern pincer of the attack, targeting Fromelles. Lee was part of D Company, which along with C Company led the Kensingtons during the assault. During the attack, the initial objectives were achieved, but at heavy cost. However, the attacking forces soon ran out of ammunition and retreated the following morning. Of the 550 men that the Kensingtons had engaged, there were 499 casualties, including 13 officers; in total the British casualties numbered over 11,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Jerusalem {{had been}} well-fortified after Heraclius recaptured {{it from the}} Persians. After the Byzantine defeat at Yarmouk, the Patriarch of Jerusalem Sophronius {{repaired}} its defenses. The Muslims had so far not attempted any siege of the city. However, since 634, Saracen forces {{had the potential to}} threaten all routes to the city. Although it was not encircled, it had been in a state of siege since the Muslims captured the neighboring forts of Pella and Bosra. After the Battle of Yarmouk, the city was severed from the rest of Syria, and was presumably being prepared for a siege that seemed inevitable. When the Muslim army reached Jericho, Sophronius collected all the holy relics including the True Cross, and secretly sent them to the coast, to be taken to Constantinople. The Muslim troops besieged the city some time in November 636. Instead of relentless assaults on the city, they decided <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>on</b> with the siege until the Byzantines ran short of supplies and a bloodless surrender could be negotiated.|$|E

5|$|The {{experience}} held {{a number}} of lessons for the Australians, not least {{of all was the}} need for tanks. Although the APCs had been used to support the infantry during the operation, they lacked the firepower and armour to be an effective substitute for tanks which would likely have found the terrain and vegetation no obstacle and may have proven decisive. Meanwhile, the futility and waste of frontal tactics and massed bayonet charges against automatic weapons had once again been demonstrated. Yet such lessons still had not been fully grasped by Australian Army training doctrine, and under pressure from Townsend <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>on</b> with the attack Mackay had given the order to fix bayonets and charge due to the proximity of his forward platoons to the Viet Cong. Despite having long since ceased to be a decisive weapon of warfare, when ordered the Australians had unhesitatingly charged towards the Viet Cong machine-guns in the certainty of suffering casualties. As a result of their bravery 5 Platoon {{became one of the most}} highly decorated Australian platoons of the war. Yet aggression alone could not overcome concentrated firepower, and many survivors were later bitter about the order and losses suffered in these attempts. Another lesson identified included the need to thoroughly prepare an unsecure landing zone by fire prior to insertion. Likewise, during the initial contact A Company had been unable to call in artillery, and the need for a dedicated command and control helicopter to co-ordinate indirect fire during an airmobile assault was also evident.|$|E
5|$|With {{his enemy}} {{visible from the}} deck of his {{flagship}} by 06:30, Howe recalled his frigates and ordered his fleet <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>on</b> all sail {{in the hope of}} engaging the rear of the scattered French line. By 10:35 Howe's continued pursuit was making his own battleline ragged, but he pressed on in the belief that Villaret intended to use the weather gage to outrun him and escape. To counter this, Howe ordered his fastest ships into a flying squadron under Admiral Thomas Pasley. This squadron was significantly faster than the majority of the vessels in either fleet and rapidly closed with the French rear. The first shots of the engagement were fired at 14:30 by HMS Russell, commanded by John Willett Payne, which managed some long-distance fire at the rearmost French ships on the opposite tack. Fire was returned by the French but without significant effect. In an attempt to hold off Pasley's squadron, at 17:00 the French first rate 110-gun Révolutionnaire exchanged places with the smaller third rates {{at the rear of the}} line and engaged the pursuing British van. This manoeuvre was apparently conducted on the initiative of Captain Vandangel of Révolutionnaire without orders from Admiral Villaret or his political observer Jean Bon Saint-André.|$|E
5|$|With {{its ranks}} {{replenished}} after the winter actions, the six-regiment division under Nansouty numbered, on 1 June 1807, {{no less than}} 3,257 men. It {{was by far the}} most powerful heavy cavalry division of the Cavalry Reserve, which then included two other such divisions, the 2nd under Saint-Sulpice and a newly added 3rd, under Espagne. As military operation resumed later in 1807, Nasouty's division was hastily directed towards the town of Deppen, where Marshal Michel Ney had managed to retreat with his Corps, after energetically extricating himself from a dangerous situation, with surprisingly few losses. With Ney's Corps, the Cavalry Reserve and the Guard, Napoleon moved towards Guttstadt, where on 9 June he found a large combined-arms enemy force. Murat took Lasalle's light horse and Nansouty's heavy cavalry and launched a series of charges that drove back the enemy force. Murat continued <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>on</b> and pushed the enemy into the streets of Guttstadt, where he penetrated with the cavalry at nightfall. Having fought well with his men, Nansouty was rested the next day, leaving all the action at the Battle of Heilsberg to Espagne's 3rd Heavy Cavalry division.|$|E
