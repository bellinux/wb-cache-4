40|$|Research and {{development}} {{work at the}} University of Southampton using an electrostatic condition monitoring system developed by Smiths Aerospace Information Systems has shown that electrostatic charge signals {{can be used to}} detect the onset of wear in lubricated tribo-contacts. Preliminary investigations have already demonstrated the viability of this system when tested on a laboratory-based pin-on-disc rig, a reciprocating laboratory wear rig and in an FZG gear scuffing rig. These preliminary experiments have indicated several charging mechanisms may be involved, namelyâ€”tribo-charging, localised surface charge variations, exo-emissions and debris generation. The electrostatic monitoring system has now been implemented on a <b>taper-roller</b> <b>bearing</b> test rig. The electrostatic system employed comprises three wear-site sensors (WSS) and an oil-line sensor (OLS). The WSS are mounted close to the bearing in order to monitor the earliest stages of component surface breakdown and wear, whereas the OLS is placed in the re-circulation oil-line to monitor debris generated and transported from the deteriorating component. For the present tests, <b>taper-roller</b> <b>bearing</b> wear was monitored using electrostatic sensors as well as vibration and lubricant temperature measurements; also two additional oil-line monitoring devices, supplied by Macom Technology Ltd., using Eddy current technology and ferromagnetism to sense debris entrained in the lubricant recirculating system were employed. The experimental data shows that the electrostatic monitoring systems detected bearing deterioration up to 4 h prior to complete failure (seizure) during a seeded fault test. The electrostatic wear-site and oil-line sensors detected changes in charge that coincided with increases in vibration, temperature and debris generation detected by the two Macom units...|$|E
40|$|A strong need {{has existed}} {{to develop a}} hard turning process that can replace {{grinding}} as a finishing process, due to its huge benefits in surface integrity and manufacturing flexibility over finish grinding and superfinishing. Due to the significant advances in machine tool accuracy and cutting tool material properties, chucking, {{which has not been}} improved significantly over the last several decades, has become the weakest link in the whole machine processing system. However, the understanding of chucking accuracy is lacking, nor is any systematic research on the improvement of chucking accuracy is available in literature. In this study, methods which enable evaluating, and improving chucking accuracy of a cylindrical workpiece were developed. This study performed systematic error identification and the analyses of the characteristics of the factors that affect chucking accuracy. Then, the formulations of the relation between the measurable factors and the chucking error were carried out as well as a chucking error map. From these analyses and formulations, methods for compensating the error components on chucking accuracy were developed. The methods were tested using the rings of a <b>taper-roller</b> <b>bearing.</b> From the tests of the methods, it was proven that hard turning alone, without any other finishing process such as grinding, can satisfy the same level of form accuracy that is currently achieved by finish grinding. With the developed chucking methods and strategies, the concentricity error could be reduced significantly or eliminated. For the case studied, we achieved about 20 times improvement in concentricity and 30 times in repeatability. The knowledge, created by this research on the improvement of chucking accuracy, can be applied to other operations requiring precision holding of a workpiece or a tool, as well as to general turning operations. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTaper roller {{bearings}} are {{important part of}} gear reducers, and their work property affects behavior of the reducers. Pre-tightening of <b>taper-roller</b> <b>bearings</b> affects both meshing contact of the gears and lubrication between the rollers and raceways of the bearings. The influence is analyzed by finite element method in this work. Firstly, a finite element model of {{roller bearings}} is established by using Reynolds equation and considering the surface roughness. Then, Stress fields in the roller and the raceway are calculated by adding load and solving, obtaining the maximum stress and strain of the bearings. Finally, effect of the pre-tightening on the work property of the bearings are analyzed by the obtained the maximum stress and strain...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{and a series}} of computerized calculations were carried out to explore competing prototype design concepts of a shaft and two <b>taper-roller</b> <b>bearings</b> systems to support the high-speed input pinion of an advanced commercial helicopter transmission. The results were used to evaluate designs both for a straddle arrangement where the pinion gear is located between the bearings and for a cantilever arrangement where the pinion is outboard of the two bearings. Effects of varying parameters including applied gear load, preload, wall thickness, interference fits, bearing spacing and pinion gear location on system rigidity, load distribution and bearing rating life were assessed. A comparison of the bearing load distributions for these designs demonstrated that the straddle more equally distributes both radial and axial loads. The performance of these designs over a range of shaft rotational speeds, with lubrication and friction effects included, is also discussed...|$|R
