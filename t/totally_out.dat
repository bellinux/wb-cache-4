5|$|In America, {{neoconservative}} {{aspirations to}} use the United States' military power to further destroy evildoers are thrown off track by the election of George H. W. Bush to the presidency, followed by the election in 1992 of Bill Clinton which left them <b>totally</b> <b>out</b> of power. The neoconservatives, along with their conservative Christian allies, attempt to demonize Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, the American people do not turn against Clinton. Meanwhile, Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the relative safety of Afghanistan and declare a new strategy. To fight Western-inspired moral decay, they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 1332, a fire {{broke out}} in the palace of the podestà, the leading {{magistrate}} of the city. This fire destroyed the roof of the palace and destroyed two-thirds of the entire structure from the ground floor up, prompting the government to rebuild the palatial residence <b>totally</b> <b>out</b> of stone, {{all the way up to}} the roof. On July 16 of that year the palace of the wool guild caught fire and everything from the ground floor up was destroyed, prompting the wool guild to reconstruct a new palatial residence on a larger scale and with stone vaults leading up to the roof.|$|E
5|$|Single {{cylinder}} {{consists of}} a single large cylinder, usually back mounted, with one first-stage regulator, and usually two second-stage regulators. This configuration is simple and cheap but it has only a single breathing gas supply: it has no redundancy in case of failure. If the cylinder or first-stage regulator fails, the diver is <b>totally</b> <b>out</b> of air and faces a life-threatening emergency. Recreational diver training agencies train divers {{to rely on a}} buddy to assist them in this situation. The skill of gas sharing is trained on most entry level scuba courses. This equipment configuration, although common with entry-level divers and used for most sport diving, is not recommended by training agencies for any dive where decompression stops are needed, or where there is an overhead environment (wreck diving, cave diving, or ice diving) as it provides no functional redundancy.|$|E

Some time after the summer of 1642, she went to New Netherland along with seven of her children, a son-in-law, and several servants—16 total persons by several accounts. They settled near an ancient landmark called Split Rock, not far from what became the Hutchinson River in northern Bronx, New York City.|$|E
25|$|In the Second Intifada, the {{generally}} non-violent {{methods of the}} earlier uprising gave way to more brutal methods against both IDF troops and Israeli citizens: stone-throwing as the hallmark of resistance yielded place to martyrdom operations, overwhelmingly conducted by Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The intifada broke out with rock throwing to protest Ariel Sharon's visit to the Haram al-Sharif on 28 September 2000, {{which led to a}} clash in which 6 Palestinians were killed, and 220 wounded by Israeli gunfire, while 70 Israeli police were injured by stoning. The incident rapidly escalated into the Second Intifada when, as rock-and Molotov-cocktail-throwing continued over the next two days, 24 Palestinians were shot dead, and an Israeli soldier was killed. At the outset, participating teenagers resumed the traditional stone-throwing to deny vehicles access to settlements. Israel's response was, according to Lev Luis Grinberg, to use all the weapons in its arsenal, including snipers, and shooting missiles from Apache helicopters at demonstrators and buildings. He concludes 'It responded with disproportionate force that only an army can unleash <b>totally</b> <b>out</b> of place against stone-throwing civilians. Human Rights Watch documented early that IDF soldiers were shooting stone throwing youths where no serious threats to their safety existed.|$|E

500|$|Bauer {{argues that}} the Aid and Rescue {{committee}} {{made the mistake of}} almost adopting the anti-Semitic belief in unlimited Jewish power, that Jewish leaders could move around freely and persuade the Allies to act, and that American Jews had easy access to money and goods. The committee had similar trust in the Allies, but the latter were preparing for the invasion of Normandy, which began on 6 June 1944.

500|$|In 1992, American magician and David Copperfield {{producer}} Chris Kenner published <b>Totally</b> <b>Out</b> of Control, {{a successful}} instructional book explaining magic effects with playing cards and other household objects. Among the many sleights featured was a two-handed card flourish on page 125 called [...] "The Five Faces of Sybil". Using all fingers, Sybil {{ends with the}} deck divided into five distinct packets. Kenner himself describes Sybil in his book as [...] "a quick cut flourish to demonstrate skill and dexterity". The flourish spawned a cycle of two-handed cut creations and formed the cornerstone {{of what is now}} known as cardistry. Journalist Kevin Pang of Vanity Fair magazine noted that [...] "every cardist can deftly perform Sybil the way guitarists can run through a blues progression".|$|E

500|$|Cardistry is a {{portmanteau}} {{of cards}} and artistry. [...] The art form of card flourishing, {{commonly referred to}} as cardistry, grew out of simple flourishes used in close-up magic by magicians in the 1990s to early 2000s. Chris Kenner's notable two-handed Sybil cut from his 1992 publication <b>Totally</b> <b>Out</b> of Control has carried great influence and gave birth to a series of advanced flourishes which today represents the foundation of the performance art. Sleight of hand pioneers Dan and Dave popularized cardistry on the world stage with their instructional DVD releases from 2004 and 2007. Journalist Kevin Pang of Vanity Fair characterized the art of card flourishing as, [...] "It's yo-yo tricks performed by cardsharps with the street cred of a Parkour video. There's a name for it: cardistry." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis {{used the}} show to {{audition}} two new members—tenor saxophonist Azar Lawrence and guitarist Dominique Gaumont. Lawrence was the most highly regarded young saxophonist at the time, while Gaumont was enlisted by Davis in response to incumbent guitarist Reggie Lucas's demand for a pay raise. Although it was unexpected, Liebman later characterized the move as typical of the trumpeter: [...] "What he was doing—which he often does at big kinda gigs like that—is change the shit up, by doing something <b>totally</b> <b>out.</b> Totally unexpected. I mean, we had been a band together {{on the road for}} a year... And then, suddenly, a live date, New York City, Carnegie Hall, the cat pulls two cats who never even saw each other.

Once {{we were out of}} Vietnam the only way we could have protected Laos was with an Army corps. It was <b>totally</b> <b>out</b> of the question and we knew it. We were licked." [...] Souvanna then faced a dilemma, sign a separate agreement with the Pathet Lao on almost any terms, or continue the war with no prospect of success. Hanoi was also desirious to obtain a quick agreement with Vientiane. The sooner the fighting in Laos ceased, the sooner the Hanoi would obtain unimpeded use of the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E

500|$|The phrase [...] "hail to the thief" [...] {{was used}} by anti-George W. Bush protesters during the {{controversy}} surrounding the 2000 US presidential election as a play on [...] "Hail to the Chief", the American presidential anthem. Yorke described hearing the phrase {{for the first time}} as a [...] "formative moment" [...] for the album. Radiohead chose the title partly to [...] "state the bleeding obvious... that the most powerful country on earth is run by somebody who stole an election", but also in response to [...] "the rise of doublethink and general intolerance and madness, and feeling very much like individuals were <b>totally</b> <b>out</b> of control of the situation that somehow it was a manifestation of something not really human." [...] The title also references the leak of the album before its completion. Yorke worried the title might be misconstrued as referring solely to the US election controversy, but his bandmates felt it [...] "conjured up all the nonsense and absurdity and jubilation of the times." ...|$|E
500|$|Not {{long after}} the {{settlement}} of Aquidneck Island, the Massachusetts Bay Colony made some serious threats {{to take over the}} island and the entire Narragansett Bay area, causing Hutchinson and other settlers much anxiety. This compelled her to move <b>totally</b> <b>out</b> of the reach of the Bay colony and its sister colonies in Connecticut and New Haven and move into the jurisdiction of the Dutch.

500|$|The {{track was}} {{released}} {{as the second}} single from the parent album on May 6, 1998 in the United States. Curtiss {{was not aware of}} the fact that Madonna had recorded [...] "Sepheryn" [...] as [...] "Ray of Light" [...] and heard it for the first time being played on the radio. He [...] "couldn't believe it" [...] and was initially a bit annoyed, but became pleased with what Madonna had done with his original composition. He was also satisfied with the 15% royalties he received as songwriter credit. Madonna took 30% royalties, another 15% were given to Maldoon's estate and the rest were earned by Madonna's record company. The singer said about the song: [...] "It's <b>totally</b> <b>out</b> of control. The original version is well over 10 minutes long. It was completely indulgent, but I loved it. It was heartbreaking to cut it down to a manageable length." [...] The original version was to be included on a compilation album, titled Veronica Electronica, although it was not released. Curtiss confirmed in an interview with The Australian in January 2017, that he recorded a contemporary jazz version of [...] "Sepheryn".|$|E

500|$|The larger Ninja Tune {{record label}} {{had been growing}} in the United Kingdom at the time with help from artists DJ Food, Funki Porcini, The Herbaliser, and Coldcut. DJ Food and Funki Porcini noticed Tobin's work on Adventures in Foam and {{prompted}} the label to approach him. Ninja Tune signed Tobin in late 1996, this time under his abbreviated name [...] "Amon Tobin". The official Ninja Tune website has said that Adventures in Foam had been re-released without permission by the US-based Shadow Records that same year and that this unauthorized version, labeled the [...] "US release", included only 7 of the original songs, different cover art, and that some tracks were titled incorrectly. In 1997 Ninja Tune acquired the proper licenses from Ninebar and re-released the album themselves. This version included the original album in its entirety, and a second disc containing previously unreleased material. , copies of Shadow Record's [...] "US version" [...] are sold by online retailer Amazon.com. Over the course of its production, Adventures in Foam has been reviewed favorably. Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork Media said that its break-beat style [...] "got <b>totally</b> <b>out</b> of hand", but that it [...] "never fails to let the listener know who's in charge."

500|$|Of the {{multiple}} music critics who {{commented on the}} song, the majority praised [...] "Skins musical structure and Rihanna's vocal performance. Apart from writing about the song's composition, Daw called the ballad [...] "smoldering" [...] and compared the last minute of the song to Sades [...] "No Ordinary Love" [...] for the song's sensual content, but noted that Adu's song is not as lyrically graphic as [...] "Skin". Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that Rihanna's sensuality in the song is evoked though her use of sexually suggestive moaning and heavy breathing, adding to the [...] "slow, torrid buildup". Colin Gentry of 4Music noted that Rihanna appears to be transitioning from singing songs about partying and dancing in clubs to singing about her sexual fantasies and desires, writing [...] "Rihanna swaggers through the album as {{a woman on the}} prowl, taking her conquests from the clubs to the bedroom. Demanding to know 'why are you standing over there with your clothes on?' on sultry track Skin, the Barbadian clearly means business." [...] Ryan Dombell of Pitchfork Media concurred with Stern with regard to [...] "Skin" [...] being the singer's most mature song to date, writing [...] "Skin' is her sexiest song yet, a haunted, near-dubstep stunner that wouldn't sound <b>totally</b> <b>out</b> of place on Massive Attack's Mezzanine." ...|$|E
