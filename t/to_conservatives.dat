5|$|In 2003, Indiana Representative Mark Souder {{proposed}} that former president Ronald Reagan, {{who was then}} dying of Alzheimer's disease, replace Roosevelt on the dime once he died, stating that Reagan was as iconic <b>to</b> <b>conservatives</b> as Roosevelt was to liberals. Reagan's wife Nancy expressed her opposition, stating that she was certain the former president would not have favored it either. After Ronald Reagan died in 2004, there was support for a design change, but Souder declined to pursue his proposal.|$|E
5|$|The {{opportunity}} {{to graduate from}} provincial to national politics came soon after. The Conservative prime minister Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão, Marquis of Paraná, faced overwhelming opposition from his own party in parliament. Paraná knew that the party's principles were seen as irrelevant and ignored at local and provincial levels. A cabinet could use patronage alone to gain backing from local bosses for its national candidates, including {{in the province of}} Rio Grande do Sul. Porto Alegre was a Liberal allied <b>to</b> <b>Conservatives</b> in his province. He pledged support to Paraná and in 1857 was elected general deputy (member of the Chamber of Deputies, the national legislature's lower house). He was reelected in 1860.|$|E
5|$|At the 1968 Republican National Convention, Agnew, who {{had earlier}} {{been asked to}} place Richard Nixon's name in nomination, was {{selected}} as running mate by Nixon and his campaign staff. Agnew's centrist reputation interested Nixon, and the law and order stance he had taken {{in the wake of}} civil unrest that year appealed to aides such as Pat Buchanan. Agnew made a number of gaffes during the campaign, but his rhetoric pleased many Republicans, and he may have made the difference in several key states. Nixon and Agnew defeated the Democratic ticket, incumbent vice president, Hubert Humphrey for president, and his running mate, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. As vice president, Agnew was often called upon to attack the administration's enemies. In the years of his vice presidency, Agnew moved to the right, appealing <b>to</b> <b>conservatives</b> who were suspicious of moderate stances taken by Nixon. In 1972, Nixon and Agnew were reelected for a second term, defeating Senator George McGovern of South Dakota and former ambassador Sargent Shriver of Maryland.|$|E

5|$|Demands for Hitler to {{constrain}} the SA strengthened. Conservatives in the army, industry, and politics placed Hitler under increasing pressure {{to reduce the}} influence of the SA and to move against Röhm. While Röhm's homosexuality did not endear him <b>to</b> <b>conservatives,</b> they were more concerned about his political ambitions. Hitler for his part remained indecisive and uncertain about just what precisely he wanted to do when he left for Venice to meet Benito Mussolini on June 15. Before Hitler left, and at the request of Presidential State Secretary Otto Meißner, Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath ordered the German Ambassador to Italy Ulrich von Hassell— without Hitler's knowledge— to ask Mussolini to tell Hitler that the SA was blackening Germany's good name. Neurath's manoeuvre to put pressure on Hitler paid off, with Mussolini agreeing to the request (Neurath was a former ambassador to Italy, and knew Mussolini well). During the summit in Venice, Mussolini upbraided Hitler for tolerating the violence, hooliganism, and homosexuality of the SA, which Mussolini stated were ruining Hitler's good reputation all over the world. Mussolini used the affair occasioned by the murder of Giacomo Matteotti {{as an example of the}} kind of trouble unruly followers could cause a dictator. While Mussolini's criticism did not win Hitler over to acting against the SA, it helped push him in that direction.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, if Kemp had won his {{campaign}} for the United States Presidency, {{it would have made}} him the first person to move from the United States House of Representatives to the White House since James Garfield. When he formed his exploratory committee, he signed Ed Rollins, Reagan's 1984 re-election political director, as an advisor. From the outset, Kemp had failed to position himself as the primary alternative to Vice President Bush. Except for a select few cognoscenti, the general public did not recognize Kemp's leadership ability, although he was a successful man of ideas. In fact, most of the Republican electorate found themselves unfamiliar with Kemp early in {{his campaign}}. Political pundits recognized him, however, as a visionary idea man. In addition, he was quickly perceived as a verbose speaker who sometimes lost contact with his audience. Although Kemp tried to appeal <b>to</b> <b>conservatives,</b> his libertarian philosophies of tolerance and individual rights and his commitment to supporting minorities, women, blue-collar workers and organized labor clashed with conservative voters' social and religious values. To Democrats, Kemp's free-market philosophies were a form of laissez-faire anarchy. However, as much as Kemp wanted to minimize government's role, he acknowledged that moves toward a more laissez-faire system should be well-thought out.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, {{conservative}} Republicans {{took control}} of Congress and opened investigations into communist infiltration {{of the federal government}} under Roosevelt. Congressman Richard Nixon accused Alger Hiss, a senior State Department official, of being a Soviet spy. Based on the testimony of Whittaker Chambers, an ex-Communist who became a leading anti-Communist and hero <b>to</b> <b>conservatives,</b> Hiss was convicted of perjury.|$|E

25|$|Beveridge's {{arguments}} were widely accepted. He appealed <b>to</b> <b>conservatives</b> and other sceptics {{by arguing that}} welfare institutions would increase the competitiveness of British industry in the post-war period, not only by shifting labour costs like healthcare and pensions out of corporate ledgers and onto the public account but also by producing healthier, wealthier and thus more motivated and productive workers who would {{also serve as a}} great source of demand for British goods.|$|E
25|$|Complaining that {{mainstream}} academia was hostile <b>to</b> <b>conservatives,</b> several foundations became especially {{active in}} funding conservative policy research, notably the Adolph Coors Foundation, the Bradley Foundation, the Koch family foundations, the Scaife Foundations, and (until it closed in 2005), the John M. Olin Foundation. Typically, they {{have emphasized the}} need for market-based solutions to national problems. The foundations often invested in conservative student publications and organizations, such as the Intercollegiate Studies Institute and legal foundations such as the Federalist Society.|$|E
25|$|The {{victory of}} Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War (1870) caused {{a shift in}} the {{politics}} of Austria. Emperor Francis Joseph turned against the Liberals who held the Premiership at the time because they were too enthusiastic for Prussia and its victory. Instead, Emperor Joseph turned <b>to</b> <b>Conservatives</b> willing to conciliate with Slavs. New York: The MacMillan Company, 1929. 372. Hohenwart, as leader of the Conservative Federalists, was chosen in order to placate the Slavs with a new federalist system. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1951. 59. Also, Emperor Francis Joseph saw Federalism as a way to undercut the Austro-German Liberals.|$|E

25|$|Birt's {{promotion}} to Director-General in 1992 caused controversy {{when it was}} revealed he was employed on a freelance consultancy basis. Under political and public pressure, Birt became a BBC employee. He had to sell his shares in LWT, losing out on a windfall of {{what would have been}} several million pounds when it was bought by Granada in 1994. The Sunday Times later revealed that Birt {{had been a member of}} the Labour Party at the time of his appointment, a concern <b>to</b> <b>Conservatives</b> who had already expressed concerns about alleged left-wing bias at the organisation.|$|E
25|$|Bismarck's {{idea was}} to {{implement}} welfare programs that were acceptable <b>to</b> <b>conservatives</b> without any socialistic aspects. He was dubious about laws protecting workers at the workplace, such as safe working conditions, limitation of work hours, and the regulation of women's and child labor. He believed that such regulation would force workers and employers to reduce work and production and thus harm the economy. Bismarck opened debate on the subject in November 1881 in the Imperial Message to the Reichstag, using the term practical Christianity to describe his program. Bismarck's program centred squarely on insurance programs designed to increase productivity, and focus the political attentions of German workers on supporting the Junkers' government. The program included sickness insurance, accident insurance, disability insurance, and a retirement pension, none of which were then in existence to any great degree.|$|E
25|$|At {{the close}} of the Great Canadian Flag Debate in 1964, which {{resulted}} in the adoption of the Maple Leaf Flag as Canada's national flag the following year, a resolution was passed by both houses of the Canadian parliament naming the Union Flag as the Royal Union Flag and designating it as the symbol of Canada's membership of the Commonwealth and its allegiance to the Crown. The move was a concession given <b>to</b> <b>conservatives,</b> who preferred to keep the old flag, with its Union Flag in the canton. A federal directive says the Royal Union Flag is to be flown alongside the Maple Leaf Flag at federal government buildings, federally-operated airports and military bases, and at the masthead of Her Majesty's Canadian ships within Canadian waters on three days of the year: Commonwealth Day, the Canadian monarch's official birthday, and the anniversary of the enactment of the Statute of Westminster 1931. The flag is to be raised only where {{there is more than one}} flag pole, to ensure the flag of Canada is not removed. The directive is sometimes followed, sometimes not.|$|E

[...] Senator George was ideal as an opponent as he was a hero <b>to</b> <b>conservatives</b> of both parties for his opposition to the New Deal and his survival of President Franklin D.

500|$|In 1924, the Campbell Case {{brought down}} the Labour {{minority}} government and forced a general election. Birkett returned to Nottingham East to campaign for his re-election, though he faced {{a much more difficult}} job than he had in 1923. The Conservative candidate, Edmund Brocklebank, was much stronger than in the previous election, and the left-wing vote was split because he was also campaigning against Tom Mann, a noted Communist. A few days before the election, a letter allegedly addressed to the Communist Party was published that mentioned organising uprisings in British colonies; fear of the [...] "socialist menace" [...] drove many voters to the right, and in the election on 29 October 1924, many Liberal members of parliament, including Birkett, lost their seats <b>to</b> <b>Conservatives.</b>|$|E

[...] The rating of film later brought {{comparisons}} to Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, released in theaters in a digitally altered and censored version {{just two weeks after}} South Park.

500|$|Yanayev had {{initially}} {{been rejected by}} the Supreme Soviet, but he was finally approved due to Gorbachev's insistence, only days after Shevardnadze had resigned from office due to Gorbachev's willingness to give leeway <b>to</b> <b>conservatives.</b> Some weeks after Yanayev's election, a senior Soviet official described Yanayev as [...] "Gorbachev's Quayle—a conservative nonentity, no threat to Gorbachev, and his selection would pacify the right-wing". At the beginning of January1991, Yanayev headed a committee working on {{the formation of a}} new cabinet. Later, he was sent to the Soviet city of Kuznetsk to negotiate with a newly formed independent trade union, making this the first time since 1917 that a Russian government official had negotiated with a trade union.

500|$|Paul had {{received}} little media attention {{during the early}} stages of the Democratic and Republican primary contests. But as Vice President George H.W.

During this time, publications also started discussed Paul's tax policy. It called for a flat income tax rate of 10% on all earnings over $10,000 annually. Paul sold his tax plan while campaigning in Utah. In front of 250 people in Kane County, he hailed California's 1978 passage of Proposition 13 as starting the [...] "tax revolt and [...] a message across the country.
