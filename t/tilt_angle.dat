5|$|On 19 August 2011, VR {{announced}} it would start a refurbishment of all its Sm3 units to improve the operating conditions during winter. The work will be done between 2012 and 2014 and will cost 10 million Euros. Alstom will cover half of the expenses. The problematic couplers will be changed to allow trains to be coupled on-the-fly again at intermediate stations. Heaters will be installed in the trains' undercarriages to prevent the formation of ice during the winter. In addition to these modifications, the <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> of the bogies will be lowered from the current eight degrees. The operating speed of the train will remain the same. , new couplers have been installed in at least Sm3 units 7x12 and 7x18.|$|E

30|$|From (20), it can {{be found}} that the optimal <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> is a {{function}} of the positions of the LED and the PD. In this paper, the position of the LED (i.e., [u,v,w]) is fixed, but the position of the PD (i.e., [a,b,c]) is variable. Therefore, to realize the <b>angle</b> <b>tilting</b> of the receiver plane, the first step is to determine the position of the PD. With an arbitrary <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> larger than zero, the tilted receiver can obtain its position by using the three-dimensional positioning method proposed in our previous work [25]. After obtaining the position of the PD, the optimal <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> for the receiver can be calculated by using (20). Finally, according to the optimal <b>tilting</b> <b>angle,</b> the receiver can realize the <b>angle</b> <b>tilting</b> by employing an electrical machinery. The electrical machinery first makes the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> to be zero and then increases the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> until the optical <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> is achieved.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to the relatively large <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> of AgNRs, we also find the influence of substrate temperature on the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle.</b> Even though no noticeable change was observed in this work, the observation in a previous report clearly shows that the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> of AgNRs decreases as the substrate temperature is lowered [25]. The <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> of the AgNRs, fabricated by an e-beam evaporator with 86 ° of deposition angle, was observed to decrease by ~ 2 ° when the substrate temperature was lowered from room temperature to 140 K [25]. Our observation of no noticeable variation of the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> in the whole temperature range, 10 – 70 °C {{can be interpreted as}} the variation of the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> was too small to be observed clearly.|$|R

Data by Scheiner, Hevelius, Staudacher, Zucconi, Schwabe, and Spoerer deliver a series of average <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> spanning a period of 270 years, additional to previously found values for 20 th-century data obtained by other authors. We find that the average <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> before the Maunder minimum were not significantly different from the modern values. However, the average <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> of a period 50 years after the Maunder minimum, namely for cycles 0 and 1, were much lower and near zero. The normal <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> before the Maunder minimum suggest that it was not abnormally low <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> which drove the solar cycle into a grand minimum.

25|$|Slight {{variations}} in Earth's orbit lead {{to changes in}} the seasonal distribution of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface and how it is distributed across the globe. There is very little change to the area-averaged annually averaged sunshine; but there can be strong changes in the geographical and seasonal distribution. The three types of orbital variations are {{variations in}} Earth's eccentricity, changes in the <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> of Earth's axis of rotation, and precession of Earth's axis. Combined together, these produce Milankovitch cycles which have a large impact on climate and are notable for their correlation to glacial and interglacial periods, their correlation with the advance and retreat of the Sahara, and for their appearance in the stratigraphic record.|$|E
25|$|The AW609 {{is powered}} by a pair of Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6C-67A {{turboshaft}} engines, which each drive a three-bladed proprotor. These engines possess roughly twice the horsepower of the similarly sized AgustaWestland AW169 helicopter. Both of the engine and proprotor pairs are mounted on a load-bearing rotatable pylon at the wing's ends, allowing the proprotors to be positioned at various angles. In helicopter mode, the proprotors can be positioned between a 75- and 95-degree angle from the horizontal, with 87 degrees being the typical selection for hovering vertically. In airplane mode, the proprotors are rotated forward and locked in position at a zero-degree angle, spinning at 84% RPM. The flight control software reportedly handles much of the complexity of the transitioning between helicopter and airplane modes; automated systems also serve to guide pilots to the correct <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> and air speed settings.|$|E
30|$|The {{specific}} <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> of AgNRs and its {{dependence on}} the substrate temperature mentioned above can be understood by the two diffusion effects. The aforementioned behaviors of the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> follow general observations. That is to say, as random diffusion becomes larger, the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> moves toward the vapor incidence direction. And {{it is well known}} that the small energy barrier of Ag crystal and the increase in the substrate temperature elevate the random diffusion effect, which leads to the observations. However, the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> is determined by complicated interplay between the two diffusion effects, and so detailed understanding cannot be obtained yet.|$|R

50|$|To {{improve the}} roll {{stability}} in transient conditions, the prototype CLEVER vehicle was fitted with an active steering system in 2012; this allowed {{the use of}} a combined Steering Direct Tilt Control (SDTC) strategy. The active steering system output {{is a function of the}} vehicle’s <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> error (the difference between the actual and ideal <b>tilt</b> <b>angle),</b> therefore at steady state when there is little or no <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> error the front wheel steer angle matches the driver’s steer demand. However, in transient situations, such as upon turn-in, a <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> error exists and the active steering system acts to reduce or eliminate the driver’s steering input. In extreme conditions it will also initiate a countersteering action whereby the front wheel momentarily steers in the opposite direction to that intended by the driver. As the cabin approaches the desired <b>tilt</b> <b>angle,</b> the magnitude of the <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> error is reduced and the front wheel steer angle takes on the value demanded by the driver.|$|E
