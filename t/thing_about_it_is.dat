Best <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> we’re going to do it whenever we want to do it. There is no deadline right now, we don’t have any dates set, we don’t have the studio, we’re going to do the record ourselves. So we will literally go in and record it and it will be probably be done before we sign a contract.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E
500|$|All {{reviews of}} the picture weren't so enthusiastic, however. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly graded the film a B-, saying that while the skating scenes are a blast, the film stumbles when it {{attempts}} {{to be too much}} for too many audiences. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times said he was surprised that with so many untested actors rounding out the main cast, [...] "the most amateurish <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the script."

500|$|AllMusic's Heather Phares {{described}} the album as more consistent than most remix collections {{and noted that}} it functions well as a record in its own right. Priya Elan of NME explained that [...] "the results are pretty much all quality" [...] {{and that some of}} the tracks are better than the original songs on Silent Alarm. Rockfeedback's Thomas Hannan stated, [...] "It's all very clever, but the most intelligent <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that it makes you think about the original in a completely altered way." [...] Pitchfork Media's Nitsuh Adebe was impressed with the album and indicated that it is [...] "surprisingly good, and surprisingly often".|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} inning of Game 1 of the ALDS against the Angels he hit his first post-season home run. It was his first homer since {{returning}} from being hit by Wang, and Youkilis said his wrist [...] "felt a lot better as the days have progressed. I think the best <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that it's playoff time, and adrenaline helps the most." [...] In the 7-game ALCS against the Indians he hit three more home runs, had 14 hits (tying the LCS record jointly held by Hideki Matsui and Albert Pujols since 2004), and scored 10 runs (bettering Matsui's 2004 ALCS record) while batting [...]500 (another new ALCS record, bettering Bob Boone's [...]455 in 1986) with a [...]576 OBP and a [...]929 slugging percentage.|$|E
500|$|Philip Stead, {{writing in}} The Times Literary Supplement {{considered}} the novel to be [...] "a morbid {{version of that}} of Beauty and the Beast". The review noted that once Bond arrives on the scene to find Michel threatened by the two thugs, he [...] "solves [...] in his usual way. A great quantity of ammunition is expended, the zip-fastener is kept busy and the customary sexual consummation {{is associated with the}} kill." [...] Stead also considered that with the words of the police captain [...] "Mr. Fleming seems to have summarized in this character's remarks some of the recent strictures on James Bond's activities." [...] Vernon Scannell, as critic for The Listener, considered The Spy Who Loved Me to be [...] "as silly as it is unpleasant". What aggrieved him most, however, was that [...] "the worst <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that it really is so unremittingly, so grindingly boring." ...|$|E

500|$|While Yost removed Braun from {{a number}} of games in September 2007 for defense, he praised Braun for his improvements. [...] "The great <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> it doesn't involve {{throwing}} at all now", said Yost, referring to Braun's biggest issue in the spring. [...] "It involves first-step quickness to the ball, which will increase his range. [...] soften his hands a little bit. [...] hand-eye coordination to the ball needs to be a little better. That comes with repetition, repetition, repetition." [...] Braun finished 2007 last of all eligible third basemen in fielding percentage (.895, with 26 errors; only the fourth third baseman since 1916 to play 100 games or more in a season and have a fielding percentage under [...]900), range factor (2.11), and zone rating (.697). [...] His target at first base was Prince Fielder, who finished 2007 last of all eligible major league first basemen in range factor (8.49), and first in errors (14). Similarly, his target at second base, Rickie Weeks, had the lowest fielding percentage of all NL second basemen (.976), and the lowest zone rating among all major league second basemen (.737).|$|E

In February 2012, One Direction expressed interest in working with Sheeran for their second studio album. In June 2012, Sheeran disclosed that One Direction would be recording two of his songs. In October 2012, Sheeran acknowledged Bevan's songwriting credit {{in an interview with}} British radio network Capital FM: [...] "The great <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> I wrote that song with a girl called Fiona Bevan when I was 17 and we lost the song. I've kept in touch with Fiona, we've done gigs and stuff and about two months ago she sent me the tune and was like, 'Oh, do you remember this?' I was like, 'Yeah, I do remember that', and I was in the studio with the One Direction boys at the time and I was playing it and they were like, 'We really like that'. It's got one of my favourite lines that I've ever written in a song." [...] On 15 October 2012, Louis Tomlinson confirmed via social networking website Twitter that [...] "Little Things" [...] would serve as the second single of their second studio album Take Me Home.|$|E
500|$|D'Angelo was {{dissatisfied}} with the direction of R and soul music when conceiving the album. In an interview for Jet, he said that [...] "the term R doesn't mean {{what it used to}} mean. R is pop, that's the new word for R" [...] He also found contemporary R to be [...] "a joke", adding that [...] "the funny <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that the people making this shit are dead serious about the stuff they're making. It's sad—they've turned black music into a club thing." [...] In the liner notes for Voodoo, Saul Williams examined the album's concept and echoes D'Angelo's dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R/soul and hip hop, noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres. In an interview for Ebony, D'Angelo said of his role and influences for Voodoo, [...] "I consider myself very respectful of the masters who came before. In some ways, I feel a responsibility to continue and take the cue from what they were doing musically and vibe on it. That's what I want to do. But I want to do it for this time and this generation". In the album's EPK, D'Angelo said that Voodoo is [...] "like a funk album. The natural progression of soul, the next step to soul is funk".|$|E

He stated, [...] "The {{strength}} of Maverick is the ease with which it switches from comedy to action, and back again....it's refreshing to find something that satisfies expectations." [...] Reviewing it for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of a possible four, writing: [...] "The first lighthearted, laugh-oriented family Western in a long time, and one of the nice <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>it</b> doesn't feel the need to justify its existence. It acts like it's the most natural thing in the world to be a Western." ...|$|R
500|$|Producers {{identified}} {{the scene in}} which Elsa sings [...] "Let It Go" [...] as a pivotal point in the character's development. The scene depicts her choice to [...] "let go" [...] of her fear of using her powers. Character design supervisor Bill Schwab said, [...] "Before 'Let It Go', Elsa is really buttoned up, her hair is up—everything is perfect. During the song, she gives herself permission to be who she is and everything changes—her hair is more wild, her gown is magical. She's finally free—even if she is all alone." [...] Animators designed Elsa's appearance to reflect her metamorphosis; in the beginning, she is shown primarily in restrictive and confining outfits. Menzel said that, after accepting her abilities, Elsa's appearance becomes [...] "very vampy", continuing, [...] "She's quite sexy for Disney, I have to say—they're pushing the limits there a little bit! But there's a gleam in her eye and a supermodel walk {{that goes with it}} and, for me, it was fun to be a blonde because I'm not in real life." [...] In a January 2014 interview with John August and Aline Brosh McKenna, Lee disclosed that Lasseter personally helped with conceptualizing Elsa's physical transformation: [...] "y favorite <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> ... <b>is</b> the actual model for doing it was John Lasseter .... he was a huge help in talking through how we translate that emotional journey ... with the animation ... e got up and he’s like, .... 'her hair goes, and she transforms, and she struts,' and he’s doing it. He’s acting it out." ...|$|E
500|$|Progressive education, a {{pedagogy}} promoting {{learning through}} real-life experiences, {{was at its}} zenith in the United States in the 1920s and 30s, and the Avery Coonley School was a widely known model of these theories in action. Avery Coonley was featured regularly in Progressive Education and other professional journals, and in 1938, the editor of Progressive Education, Gertrude Hartman, published {{a profile of the}} Avery Coonley School in her book Finding Wisdom: Chronicles of a School of Today. She noted, [...] "isitors {{from all parts of the}} United States and from foreign countries [...] to see the school—sometimes as many as thirty in a day." [...] Hartman described in great detail the curriculum and daily life of the school, which had by then added a seventh and eighth grade, commenting that the most noticeable <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the spirit of earnestness and joy which pervades it... There is a fundamental philosophy of life and education underlying the work of the school, which gives clear direction to all its activities. Broad areas are planned, which form the framework of the curriculum. These however are flexible and subject to modification depending upon conditions. The book described the progress of the students from their first year of kindergarten through their ten years of study, capturing in photos, stories, and examples of students' work their encounters with nature, history, art and other subjects through creative play and collaborative projects. She concluded with observations about the importance of the daily life of the school in developing social responsibility: It is the belief of those concerned with the school that out of the kind of education described here will emerge more socially enlightened members of society than the education of our generation has produced... The method in which those in the school place their faith is the building into the very nature of growing boys and girls, through their growing years, those qualities of mind and spirit from which alone a new attitude towards human relations can evolve. Finding Wisdom became a classic in the education field and solidified the Avery Coonley School's national reputation as a model of progressive education.|$|E
2500|$|The {{staff at}} Variety {{magazine}} gave the film a mixed review and wrote {{that it was}} over the top: [...] "To Live and Die in L.A. looks like a rich man's Miami Vice. William Friedkin's evident attempt to fashion a West Coast equivalent of his 1971 The French Connection is engrossing and diverting enough on a moment-to-moment basis but is overtooled ... Friedkin keeps dialog to a minimum, but what conversation there is proves wildly overloaded with streetwise obscenities, {{so much so that}} it becomes something of a joke". Another mixed review came from Janet Maslin in The New York Times, who wrote [...] "On its own terms, it's a considerable success, though it's a film that sacrifices everything in the interests of style." [...] In his scathing review for the Washington Post, Paul Attanasio wrote, [...] "To Live and Die in L.A. will live briefly and die quickly in L.A., where God hath no wrath like a studio executive with bad grosses. Then again, perhaps it's unfair to hold this overheated and recklessly violent movie to the high standard established by Starsky and Hutch". Jay Scott, in his review for the Globe and Mail, wrote, [...] "Pity poor Los Angeles: first the San Andreas fault and now this. The <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> To Live and Die in L.A., for all its amorality and downright immorality, is a cracker-jack thriller, tense and exciting and unpredictable, and more grimy fun than any moralist will want it to be". Time criticized its [...] "brutal, bloated car-chase sequence pilfered from Friedkin's nifty The French Connection", and called it [...] "a fetid movie hybrid: Miami Vile".|$|E
50|$|Whether {{the remark}} {{attributed}} to Half Yellow Face {{was made on}} the morning of June 25, 1876 through an interpreter or by sign language, two <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>are</b> true.
