40|$|Frozen {{storage is}} an {{integral}} part of effective food distribution. In general, both food quality retention and storage costs will increase as storage temperatures decrease. In this paper, we develop a model for optimal temperature design for semi-perishable seafood inventory, and apply the model to Pacific Whiting surimi. General results demonstrate that managing optimal temperature is a dynamic concept dependent on the <b>time-temperature</b> <b>tolerance</b> of frozen inventory, the cost of frozen storage, and the rate of inventory dissipation. Specific results show that the optimal storage temperature of surimi varies with the rate of inventory dissipation...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{simulating}} time-temperature {{histories of}} steam electric power plants {{were conducted to}} determine their effects on American shad eggs. Heat shocks ranged from 10 to 14. 5 ºC, exposure times ranged from 5 to 60 minutes. Effects were determined by egg mortality and hatchability. Test temperatures from 34. 0 ºC up were lethal. Lower test temperatures produced different results, depending on developmental stages, with beginning embryo stage more sensitive than late embryo stage. Results of this experiment were reviewed with those of previous workers, and a summarization of <b>time-temperature</b> <b>tolerance</b> level of shad eggs is presented...|$|E
