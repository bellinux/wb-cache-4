25|$|In {{order to}} save costs, an {{increasing}} number of polyester intermediate producers like spinning mills, strapping mills, or cast film mills are working on the direct use of the PET-flakes, from the treatment of used bottles, with a view to manufacturing {{an increasing number of}} polyester intermediates. For the adjustment of the necessary viscosity, besides an efficient drying of the flakes, it is possibly necessary to also reconstitute the viscosity through polycondensation in the melt phase or solid-state polycondensation of the flakes. The latest PET flake conversion processes are applying <b>twin</b> <b>screw</b> extruders, multi-screw extruders or multi-rotation systems and coincidental vacuum degassing to remove moisture and avoid flake pre-drying. These processes allow the conversion of undried PET flakes without substantial viscosity decrease caused by hydrolysis.|$|E

25|$|City of Lowell was a <b>twin</b> <b>screw</b> {{passenger}} steamer {{launched on}} 21 November 1893 by Bath Iron Works and delivered in July 1894 for the Norwich & New York Transportation Company {{for use on}} Long Island Sound. The Norwich Line, operated by the New York and New England Railroad, placed the steamer on the overnight service between New York and New London, Connecticut. Passengers connected by rail at New London for Boston and Worcester, Massachusetts. The ship was in commercial operation until 1939 when apparently laid up awaiting scrapping. At the outbreak of World War II City of Lowell was acquired by the War Shipping Administration with eventual transfer of title to the War Department for use as an Army troop transport. The ship was sold to Potomac Shipwrecking Company of Washington, D.C. in November 1946 for scrapping.|$|E
25|$|Any type of pump {{that can}} deliver the {{required}} pressure difference and flow volume can be used. Most often used is the dynamic-compression centrifugal type compressor, which {{is familiar to}} most as being used in vacuum cleaners and turbochargers, but multistaged axial-flow compressor types, {{similar to those used}} in most jet engines, could work as well, although there would be little need for the added cost and complexities involved, as they typically don't require such a high flow rate as a jet engine, nor are they limited by the aerodynamic drag considerations which makes a narrow-diameter axial compressor more effective in jet engines than a centrifugal compressor of equal air flow. Positive displacement types such as piston compressors, or rotary types such as a Roots blower could also be used with suitable provisions for damping the pulsations in the air flow (however, other rotary types such as <b>twin</b> <b>screw</b> compressors are capable of providing a steady supply of compressed fluid). The pressure ratio of a single fan blade is too low and cannot be used.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a case study}} about the condition monitoring of the twin-screw multiphase pump in the subsea field to demonstrate how condition monitoring techniques can be applied for subsea equipment. Firstly a FMECA (Failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis) worksheet is carried out to identify the critical components of a twin-screw multiphase pump. Among the identified critical components, the mechanical seal and the <b>twin</b> <b>screws</b> are determined as study objects. For the condition monitoring of the mechanical seal, four different methods are introduced to detect {{the conditions of the}} mechanical seal. Then a physics-based model and a data-driven model are presented respectively as the diagnosis and prognosis models for the case of mechanical seals. For the <b>twin</b> <b>screws,</b> by learning the wear mechanism of the screws, the pressure distribution along the screw axis is decided to be measured to analyse the wear conditions of the <b>twin</b> <b>screws.</b> Afterwards Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is proposed for the failure diagnosis and prognosis. In addition a numerical example is computed to prove that HMM has the ability to identify the current wear state and predict the remaining useful life of the <b>twin</b> <b>screws...</b>|$|R

500|$|To raise {{additional}} capital, in 1879 {{the privately}} held British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company was reorganised {{as a public}} stock corporation, the Cunard Steamship Company, Ltd.
