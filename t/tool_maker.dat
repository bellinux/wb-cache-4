25|$|A hard hammerstone {{would first}} {{be used to}} rough out {{the shape of the}} tool from the stone by {{removing}} large flakes. These large flakes might be re-used to create tools. The <b>tool</b> <b>maker</b> would work around the circumference of the remaining stone core, removing smaller flakes alternately from each face. The scar created by the removal of the preceding flake would provide a striking platform for the removal of the next. Misjudged blows or flaws in the material used could cause problems, but a skilled toolmaker could overcome them.|$|E
25|$|Originally, handpieces varied {{little in}} design as the common use was to push with the handle placed {{firmly in the}} center of the palm. With modern {{pneumatic}} engraving systems, handpieces are designed and created in a variety of shapes and power ranges. Handpieces are made using various methods and materials. Knobs may be handmade from wood, molded and engineered from plastic, or machine-made from brass, steel, or other metals. The most widely known hand engraving <b>tool</b> <b>maker,</b> GRS Tools in Kansas is an American-owned and operated company that manufacture handpieces as well as many other tools for various applications in metal engraving.|$|E

500|$|In 1906 Upton Sinclair {{published}} The Jungle, {{uncovering the}} horrid {{conditions in the}} stockyards around {{the start of the}} 20th century. The stockyards are referred to in Carl Sandburg's poem Chicago: [...] "proud to be Hog Butcher, <b>Tool</b> <b>Maker,</b> Stacker of Wheat, Player with Railroads and Freight Handler to the Nation." [...] Frank Sinatra mentioned the yards in his 1964 song [...] "My Kind of Town," [...] and the stockyards receive a mention in the opening chapter of Thomas Pynchon's novel Against the Day. The Skip James song [...] "Hard Times Killing floor blues" [...] refers to the nickname of the slaughter part of the stockyards during the great depression in the 1930s. The Yards were a major tourist stop, with visitors such as Rudyard Kipling, Paul Bourget and Sarah Bernhardt. The play Saint Joan of the Stockyards, a version of the story of Joan of Arc by Bertolt Brecht takes place in the stockyards. The 1950 film Union Station [...] with William Holden has the final scene at the Union Stockyards.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{graduating from}} high school in June 1941, Ovshinsky worked as a <b>tool</b> <b>maker</b> and {{machinist}} in various local shops affiliated with the rubber industry. During the Second World War, he and his bride, Norma Rifkin, moved to Arizona, where Ovshinsky worked for a time in the tool room of a Goodyear plant in Litchfield, not far from Phoenix.

There he developed and patented his first invention, the Benjamin Center Drive, named after his father. [...] This unique automatic high-speed center drive lathe had many important uses. [...] After Ovshinsky sold his company to the New Britain Machine Company in Connecticut, it was used to help solve the national crisis of making artillery shells in large enough volume for wartime needs during the Korean War. [...] Meanwhile, Ovshinsky continued to develop his growing interest in human and machine intelligence, avidly studying the research literature on neurophysiology, neurological disease, and cybernetics, corresponding briefly with Norbert Wiener.|$|E

40|$|In our days, German machine <b>tool</b> <b>makers</b> accuse their Chinese {{competitors}} {{of violating}} patent rights and illegally imitating German technology. A century ago, however, German machine <b>tool</b> <b>makers</b> used {{exactly the same}} methods to imitate American technology. To understand the dynamics of this catching-up process we use patent statistics to analyze firms' activities between 1877 and 1932. We show that German machine <b>tool</b> <b>makers</b> successfully deployed imitating and counterfeiting activities in the late 19 th century and the 1920 s to catchup to their American competitors. The German administration supported this strategy by stipulating a patent law that discriminated against foreign patent holders and probably also by delaying the granting of patents to foreign applicants. Parallel to the growing international competitiveness of German firms, however, the willingness to guarantee intellectual property rights of foreigners was also increasing because German firms had now to fear retaliatory measures in their own export markets when violating foreign property rights within Germany.

40|$|This thesis gathers methods, tools, and {{techniques}} suitable for <b>tool</b> <b>makers</b> to analyze, manage, implement, and develop their operations. It {{has been written}} for a research group in the tool making laboratory (Werkzeugmaschinenlabor) in Rheinisch-Westfaelische Technische Hochschule Aachen (RWTH Aachen). The goal of this re-search was to find some ideas about the areas where the research group could develop a new analyzing method for tool making industry. The theoretic background for this research report forms from strategic management and planning and from the business model theory of Lechner and Müller-Stewens (2005), chosen by the research group. The main target of this research, operationalizing, is always depending on strategic choices {{that have been made}} in a company. A sample of methods, tools {{and techniques}} for analyzing, developing, implementing and managing operations are described and classified into different fields of operations. From among these methods, tools and techniques some areas rouse up as more mea-ningful for <b>tool</b> <b>makers.</b> They are presented as suggestions for future research for the research group {{at the end of this}} report. These suggestions relate to the skills of the hu-man resources, service functions, and co-operation platforms with which the European <b>tool</b> <b>makers</b> try to compete in the global markets. /Kir 1...|$|R
