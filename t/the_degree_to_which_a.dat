25|$|<b>The</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> tendon is {{reparable}} {{depends on}} its quantity and quality.

By contrast those whose tendon was torn by a substantial fall often have good quality tendon that can be repaired if surgery is performed promptly after the injury.|$|E
25|$|In medicine, {{compliance}} (also adherence, capacitance) describes <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> patient correctly follows medical advice.

25|$|Though the {{relatively}} small size of the crease is such that they limit <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> batsman or a bowler can alter where they stand to face or deliver a ball, there is a degree of latitude afforded whereby both can move around the crease {{as long as they}} remain within the aforementioned confines. Batsmen 'use the crease' when they move toward leg or off, before or while playing a shot. Bowlers 'use the crease' by varying the position of their feet, relative to the stumps, at the moment of delivery. In so doing, they can alter the angle of delivery and the trajectory of the ball.|$|E
25|$|Hans Eysenck {{described}} extraversion-introversion as <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> {{person is}} outgoing and interactive with other people. These behavioral differences are {{presumed to be}} the result of underlying differences in brain physiology. Eysenck combined cortical inhibition and excitation with the ascending reticular activation system (ARAS), a pathway located in the brainstem. Extraverts seek excitement and social activity in an effort to heighten their arousal level, whereas introverts tend to avoid social situations in an effort to keep such arousal to a minimum. Eysenck designated extraversion as one of three major traits in his P-E-N model of personality, which also includes psychoticism and neuroticism.|$|E

25|$|The way the {{individual}} {{rights of a}} family member versus {{the rights of the}} family as a unit are balanced vary significantly in different societies. This may influence <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> government may be willing to investigate family incidents. In some cultures, individual members of the family are expected to sacrifice almost completely their own interests in favor of the interests of the family as a whole. What is viewed as an undue expression of personal autonomy is condemned as unacceptable. In these cultures the family predominates over {{the individual}}, and where this interacts with cultures of honor, individualistic choice that may damage the family reputation in the community may result in extreme punishment, such as honor killings.|$|E
25|$|The {{brilliance}} {{of lead crystal}} relies on the high refractive index caused by the lead content. Ordinary glass has a refractive index of n = 1.5, while the addition of lead produces a range up to 1.7 or 1.8. This heightened refractive index also correlates with increased dispersion, which measures <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> medium separates light into its component spectra, as in a prism. Crystal cutting techniques exploit these properties to create a brilliant, sparkling effect as each cut facet reflects and transmits light through the object. The high refractive index is useful for lens making, since a given focal length can be achieved with a thinner lens. However, the dispersion must be corrected by other components of the lens system {{if it is to}} be achromatic.|$|E
25|$|The use of Irish was {{influenced}} by immigrants' local origins, {{the time of their}} arrival and <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> sense of Irishness survived. In 1894 the New Zealand Tablet, a Catholic newspaper, published articles on the study of Irish. In 1895 it was resolved at a meeting in the city of Dunedin that an Irish-language society on the lines of the Philo-Celtic Society of New York should be established in New Zealand. Gaelic League branches were formed in two New Zealand localities (Milton and Balclutha) and items in Irish were published by the Southern Cross of Invercargill. In 1903 Fr William Ganly, a native speaker from the Aran Islands prominent in Gaelic Revival circles in Melbourne, visited Milton, where he met a large number of Irish speakers.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, the ABFO {{began making}} {{an attempt to}} {{diminish}} the discrepancies and increase the validity of bite mark analysis by creating bite mark methodology guidelines. The guidelines attempt to establish standard terminology in describing bite marks and that {{reduces the risk of}} biased results. The ABFO also provides advice on how to effectively collect and preserve evidence. For example, they recommend that the collection of DNA evidence and detailed photographs of bites be taken together at the crime scene. The guidelines also outline how and what a forensic odontologist should record, such as the location, contours, shape, and size of a bite mark. They also provide a system of scoring to assess <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> suspect‚Äôs dental profile and bite mark match. According to the ABFO, the guidelines are not a mandate of methods to be used, but a list of generally accepted methods. The guidelines are intended to prevent potentially useful evidence from being thrown out simply because the forensic odontologist‚Äôs collection methods were not standardized.|$|E
25|$|In appearance, {{the larvae}} are dark orange with small black spines {{protruding}} {{outward from the}} body. The larval stages of gulf fritillaries include five instars, each with a varying timeframe. After the eggs hatch, the new larvae eats the egg casings for food. Eventually, the larvae will transition either to consuming other eggs or parts of the host plant for nourishment. Throughout the first three instar stages, the larvae primarily consume the leaves and feed away from the leaf margins of the host plant. How much of the leaf and how deep into the layers the larva will eat depend on the type (i.e. thickness or thinness) of the leaf in question. Throughout the last two instar stages, the larvae mainly consume the leaves and feed at the leaf margins. Throughout this food acquisition process, <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> specific leaf is eaten before it is abandoned in favor of another newer leaf largely depends on whether food is in plentiful or scarce supply. The average duration of the larval stage is between 11 and 16 days depending on {{the temperature of the}} environment.|$|E
