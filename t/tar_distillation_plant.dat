50|$|The old village core of Moste stood {{north of}} {{the point where the}} Gruber Canal {{currently}} empties into the Ljubljanica River. It originally consisted of a row of houses below the sloping land (ježa) above the river, which is reflected in the old street name Pod ježami (literally, 'below the sloping land') in the Vodmat neighborhood. After the 1895 Ljubljana earthquake, small one-story buildings for laborers and low-ranking civil servants were built in Moste, which is also reflected in the street layout. In the 20th century, the part of Moste south of the railroad largely retained its rural character, whereas the part {{north of the}} railroad was industrialized. A factory for processing bauxite was built in 1906. Other prewar industries included Saturnus (founded in 1912), which made metal containers, and a <b>tar</b> <b>distillation</b> <b>plant.</b> Moste was annexed by the City of Ljubljana in 1935, ending its existence as an independent settlement. After the Second World War, Moste was further industrialized; rail freight services and warehouses were built in Moste, and the relocation of the airport from Polje to Zgornji Brnik further increased opportunities for industrial development.|$|E
40|$|Strategies for the {{decontamination}} of soils polluted with coal by-products, especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, {{have been}} analyzed. Rate {{and degree of}} aromatic hydrocarbons were studied in different microbial soil decontamination processes, and a test has been elaborated {{for the evaluation of}} success and expense of these biotechnical measures. Field tests were carried out at former sites of coking, <b>tar</b> <b>distillation</b> and impregnation <b>plants.</b> While aromatic hydrocarbons with up to four rings are principally accessible to microbial degradation, the degradation is hampered by strong adsorption of the aromatic molecules on soil particles and by biotoxical contaminations. Therefore flexible criteria are needed for an application-oriented evaluation of soils contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

40|$|In this paper, two ethanol {{processes}} {{integrated with}} a softwood pulp mill are compared {{with regard to}} their steam demand, process integration potential and profitability. The processes differ in the solids loading in the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation step and in the resulting ethanol concentration. The results show that a higher ethanol concentration does not necessarily lead to significant reductions in steam demand. Instead, it is demonstrated that the steam demand for distillation is highly dependent on the design of the <b>distillation</b> <b>plant.</b> Nevertheless, a higher solids loading (high gravity) can be beneficial for the treatment of the stillage from the <b>distillation</b> <b>plant.</b> A higher solids loading results either in a lower steam demand for evaporation of the stillage or possibly in a reduced demand for effluent treatment compared to a conventional solids loading process. While the results show that a higher ethanol concentration leads to advantages in energy costs and investment costs for the <b>distillation</b> <b>plant,</b> they also show that the potential benefits of a high-gravity process are offset by the expected decrease in ethanol yield, which leads to higher raw material costs.

40|$|Energy {{optimization}} {{is a hot}} research {{topic for}} design and operation of crude oil <b>distillation</b> <b>plants.</b> Optimum energy utilization in a multistage crude oil distillation process is achieved by optimizing the distillation load of each distillation column {{as well as the}} yield of the sidestreams of distillation columns. A generalized multistage distillation energy consumption model is proposed, and the optimal distillation load distribution is accomplished by minimizing the total energy consumption. Based on the optimal distillation loads, a nonlinear programming model is then formulated to determine the yields of sidestreams by maximizing the thermal exergy recovery for the crude oil plant. Finally, a four-stage crude oil <b>distillation</b> <b>plant</b> is investigated to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. The results show a decrease in energy consumption and an increase in heat recovery...|$|R

40|$|The {{fermentation}} process {{is an important}} component in the biodegradation of organic compounds in natural and contaminated systems. Comparing with terminal electron-accepting processes (TEAPs), however, research on {{fermentation process}}es has to some extent been ignored in the past decades, particularly on the persistence of fermentation process in the presence of toxic organic pollutants. Both field and laboratory studies, presented here, showed that microbial processes in a groundwater-based system exhibited a differential inhibitory response to toxicity of phenolic compounds from coal <b>tar</b> <b>distillation,</b> thus resulting in the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and hydrogen. This indicated that fermentation processes could be more resistant to phenol toxicity than the subsequent TEAPs such as methanogenesis and sulfate reduction, thus providing us with more options for enhancing bioremediation processes...|$|R
