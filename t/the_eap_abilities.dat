40|$|Abstract Background The {{education}} and activation program (EAP) is a newly developed intervention {{to prevent the}} development of chronic shoulder complaints (SCs). Trained general practitioners (GPs) administer <b>the</b> <b>EAP.</b> <b>The</b> <b>EAP</b> addresses inadequate cognitions and maladaptive behavior related to the SCs. The effect of <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> is evaluated in a randomized clinical trial. The aim {{of the present study}} is to use videotaped consultations to study (1) the performance of trained GPs administering <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> and (2) <b>the</b> presence of key features of <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> already embedded in usual care (UC). Methods Five trained GPs were videotaped while treating a standardized patient with EAP. Additionally, five GPs administering UC were videotaped. Two blinded observers evaluated the videotapes in relation to key features of <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> which were scored on <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> checklist. Results <b>The</b> mean total score on <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> checklist was 4. 7 (SD = 2. 9) for the UC group and 7. 1 (SD = 2. 1) for <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> group. Neither group reached a score higher than 8, which was considered to reflect an acceptable number of key EAP features. Conclusion Our comparison of the presence of key features of <b>EAP</b> shows that <b>the</b> UC and <b>EAP</b> groups differed less than was expected. GPs in the UC group performed above expectation, with a mean total score of 4. 7. Moreover, the low number of key features present in <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> group may very well have led to a reduced effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>EAP.</b> <b>The</b> results of this study can be used to optimize the training of GPs using <b>the</b> <b>EAP.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|SAPS is {{currently}} implementing an EAP. Supervisors {{are an important}} link in <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> process {{because they are the}} first persons to identify a troubled employee and to refer the employee to <b>the</b> <b>EAP.</b> Owing to her knowledge of an EAP and her interest in supervisory training, the researcher was asked to assist with the development of a supervisory training programme. The researcher has been employed as a social worker in the SAPS for ten years. In practice it happens that commanders refer troubled employees to <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> when <b>the</b> commanders do not {{know what else to do}} with the troubled employees. At that stage the problems that the employees experience are of such a nature that long-term therapy is needed to attend to them. At times the commanders will act as social workers instead of referring the employee to <b>the</b> <b>EAP.</b> <b>The</b> researcher wanted to establish empirically what the role, knowledge and the attitude of commanders within the SAPS are regarding <b>the</b> <b>EAP.</b> <b>The</b> researcher decided to explore the topic by means of a literature study regarding <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> in <b>the</b> SAPS and supervisory training and to interview several experts in <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> in <b>the</b> SAPS and two experts in private organisations. An interview schedule was compiled and tested on one respondent. The information gained from the interview was sufficient and the researcher could go ahead with the data collection. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two percent (2 %) of the commanders in area West-Metropole. The researcher interviewed one (1) Senior superintendent, two (2) Superintendents, four (4) Captains and three (3) Inspectors. None of the respondents had previous training in <b>the</b> <b>EAP.</b> A stratified random sample was used to select the respondents. From the information gathered from the respondents, the researcher achieved the objectives of the study and provide answers to the three (3) research questions, namely: • What is the knowledge of SAPS commanders regarding <b>the</b> <b>EAP?</b> • What is the knowledge of SAPS commanders regarding their role within <b>the</b> <b>EAP?</b> • What is the attitude of SAPS commanders towards <b>the</b> <b>EAP?</b> <b>The</b> researcher determined that the respondents had limited knowledge regarding <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> and <b>the</b> services rendered by <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> professionals in <b>the</b> SAPS. The respondents all knew that they had to refer the troubled employee to <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> but some of them first tried to be the social worker before they referred to <b>the</b> <b>EAP.</b> Therefore it is important that the distinctive roles of the commander/supervisor and <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> are identified. All the respondents felt positive towards <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> in <b>the</b> SAPS and said that they self would make use of the services of <b>the</b> <b>EAP.</b> Although <b>the</b> researcher could not generalise the findings, sufficient information was provided to make the following valuable recommendations: recommendations regarding the content of a supervisory training programme, the marketing of the services rendered by <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> in <b>the</b> SAPS and the steps that could be taken to ensure confidence in <b>the</b> <b>EAP.</b> Dissertation (MSD (Employee Assistance Programme)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

[...] Zen proverb Employee Assistance Program (EAP) professionals, whether working within an {{organization}} or as outside consultants, frequently are approached by managers requesting advice or assistance in dealing with a problem employee. Typically, the manager {{wants to know what}} to do with this individual to solve the problem, and wants to take quick ameliorative action. Often, this amounts to asking <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> professional to figure out a way to "fix " the problem within a reasonable period of time.

Five areas were explored: (1) the management consultation process <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> director provides to supervisors and administrators; (2) what influences {{the way in which}} <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> director provides these management consultation services; (3) how <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> director explores <b>the</b> individual, departmental or organizational influences on the presenting problem; (4) what <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> director does to reach a broader level of experience or awareness for the supervisor during the consultation; (5) metaphors for the meaning of work as an EAP director and consultant. Using phenomenology as the methodology, long interviews were conducted with each of <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> directors. <b>The</b> process of phenomenological reduction was used to describe the essential experience of management consultation. Results indicate that EAP directors use their intuition, clinical and organizational skills when engaged in management consultation. <b>The</b> <b>EAP</b> director works with the manager to create a mutually formulated plan for addressing the concerns of the manager or the concerns for the employee or both.

Several categories of information were collected, including the nature and frequency of personal problems experienced by employees of the company, current ways in which personal problems were handled, the form of assistance employees would prefer, and the attitude of employees towards a possible <b>EAP</b> at <b>the</b> company. This information was collected by means of a questionnaire developed for this research, and answered by a representative group of employees, as well as interviews conducted with the welfare officer and personnel practitioners at the company. The data were analysed by means of frequency tables, whereafter the results of the needs assessment indicated that there appeared to be a need for an <b>EAP</b> at <b>the</b> company. Recommendations concerning <b>the</b> most suitable <b>EAP</b> were then ~ made. The second aim of {{the research}} was to conduct an economic evaluation by means of a cost-benefit analysis of an EAP at a utility company, and comprised a monetary comparison of the estimated costs and benefits (savings) of <b>the</b> <b>EAP.</b> Thereafter <b>the</b> economic efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> was expressed in terms of savings per rand invested. The benefits of <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> were represented by estimated savings due to reduction in absenteeism and increase in job performance due to <b>EAP</b> intervention. <b>The</b> costs attributable to <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> include personnel salaries and benefits, training, administration costs, cost of materials and equipment, and travelling costs. The cost and benefit data were extracted from company records. The results indicated that the costs of operating the programme exceeded the benefits, that <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> was possibly not run cost-effectively, and therefore that further evaluation of the procedures concerning <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> was needed. In addition, the cost- benefit analysis indicated relatively high absenteeism and low levels of job performance among EAP clients, and on average this did not change after EAP intervention, in fact it became worse. This indicated the need for further research to determine whether there were other factors except personal problems that influenced absenteeism and job performance of EAP clients.

The sample size of the study was 70 supervisors in DoL, representative of all the Business Units in the organization, wherein only 41 respondents participated in the study. Stratified random sampling was utilized to draw the sample from the population by dividing the population in terms of the sub-groups. The required number of respondents was further selected by using the random sampling method. A theoretical overview on EAP and EAP policy implementation procedures and activities was provided through a literature review. In the literature review, focus was on the following aspects: historical development of <b>EAPs,</b> <b>the</b> introduction of <b>EAPs</b> in South Africa, the legislative framework for EAPs and their implications, the concept and types of evaluation and the reasons for conducting evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> policy implementation. <b>The</b> literature review section concluded with the overview of the department by focusing on: the mandate of the Department of Labour, including the core functions performed by the employees in different areas of responsibility and the challenges faced by the employees in their calls of duty. These challenges provided an indication of the realities that employees are confronted with and which may result in those employees to seek for assistance from <b>the</b> relevant <b>EAP</b> section in <b>the</b> DoL.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} has been to explore perceptions of supervisors regarding their referral role within the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP). Traditionally supervisors are expected to identify troubled employees and refer them to <b>the</b> <b>EAP.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> study will help in identifying perceptions {{on the part of}} the supervisors and improve knowledge as to how they perceive their referral role within <b>the</b> <b>EAP.</b> <b>The</b> researcher did an exploratory study in this qualitative applied research, since her intention was to gain understanding of the perceptions of supervisors regarding their referral role within <b>the</b> <b>EAP.</b> It is <b>the</b> aim of the qualitative approach to understand the meaning that individuals attach to their everyday lives. The population consisted of 30 EAP client companies of The Careways Group in Gauteng. The researcher interviewed 12 respondents from three client companies, who had 20 % or fewer supervisory referrals. The 12 respondents were selected as the sample through non-probability sampling, utilizing a purposive sampling method. Five of the respondents were working for Nashua Mobile, four were working for Computer Share and three were working for New Vaal. The empirical data was gathered by means of a semi-structured interview schedule. A tape recorder was used to record the interviews and put data into transcripts. All respondents signed an informed consent form (Appendix D). An in-depth literature review was conducted about the benefits of an EAP, types of referrals, responsibilities of a supervisor, resistance to utilise <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> and addressing supervisors’ referral problems. Findings indicate that supervisors need comprehensive training regarding <b>the</b> <b>EAP,</b> which should also be linked with other management trainings. Supervisors believe that they are the key figures in implementing the programme because they work closely with employees, but they are not confident enough to implement the programme due to lack of knowledge. Supervisors indicated that <b>the</b> <b>EAP</b> plays a minimal role as a management tool and there is a need to re-position the programme based on the needs of the organisation. There is a general view that as the needs of the organisations is changing, so should the focus of <b>the</b> <b>EAP.</b> Dissertation (MSW) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.
