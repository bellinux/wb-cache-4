40|$|The dorsal {{margin of}} the trigeminal {{principal}} nucleus (PV) contains neurons responsive to innocuous thermal stimulation of the tongue and may be a <b>thermal</b> <b>relay</b> (Hayama and Hashimoto, 2011). The present electrophysiological study examined whether PV thermoreceptive neurons project to the thalamus and investigated response properties to cold (20 °C) or warm (40 °C) stimulation of the tongue. Twenty-three thermoreceptive neurons were identified in the dorsal portion of the PV. Twenty of the 23 neurons were examined but none projected to the thalamus. Impulse frequencies of 8 of the 11 thermoreceptive neurons examined rapidly increased with cold stimulation, then decreased and gradually increased to steady state level, and rapidly decreased with warm stimulation. Thermal receptive fields were examined for 6 PV thermoreceptive neurons; five had a large receptive field extending over the whole anterior tongue ipsilateral to the recording side. These {{findings suggest that the}} dorsal portion of the PV is not a <b>thermal</b> <b>relay</b> mediating thermal information from the tongue to the thalamus...|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to analyze}} the {{coordination}} and selectivity of the protection in a low voltage industrial electrical installation, so that the protection devices isolate and eliminate the fault quickly and selectively. To achieve this objective, {{a survey of the}} installed loads was carried out, a conference of fuse values and adjustment of the <b>thermal</b> <b>relays,</b> verification of the gauge of the cables connecting the respective loads and calculations of the short-circuit current through a software. Therefore, we want to demonstrate the importance of the correct selection of protection equipment and the impact that it can cause in productivity when incorrectly designed, impacting the continuity of the electric power supply to the manufacturing process. The analyzes presented here are based on the IEEE 242 standard, coordination and selectivity reports, and authors such as Caminha, Mamede Filho, Hewitson and Mardegan. The study was carried out within a pulp and paper industry, which, because it was an old plant, some protective equipment had to be replaced by modern ones. For example, the fuse switches and the bimetallic relays were replaced by electronic <b>thermal</b> <b>relays</b> and motor circuit breaker, since the old equipment did not allow us to make the correct coordination and selectivity, while others were only adjusted to work accordingly with the nominal data of the motors information plates. in this way, the objective of adapting the coordinated and selective protection system for overload, short-circuit and blocked rotor disarms was reached...|$|R
40|$|<b>Thermal</b> {{overload}} <b>relays</b> are economic electromechanical {{protection devices}} which offers reliable protection for electric motors {{in the event}} of overload or phase failure. Presently {{there are two types of}} overload relays which depend on the temperature characteristics of metals to provide protection by tripping the circuit. These relays lack accuracy as they do not activate the trip circuit at any exact specified temperature. In this paper we introduce a new form of <b>thermal</b> over-load <b>relay</b> actuated by ferrofluid. The ferrofluid has a very accurate transition temperature known as curie temperature. It acts as a ferromagnetic material below the curie temperature and loses the property of ferromagnetism above this temperature. By using this property of the fluid we propose an alternative method for more accurate operation under overload condition. This relay finds application in the protection system of electrical machines. Thus, in this paper we present a novel and simple technique for protection against thermal overloading using ferrofluid...|$|R
40|$|Neurons {{responding}} to innocuous thermal {{stimulation of the}} anterior tongue were newly identified in the dorsal margin of the trigeminal principal nucleus (PV). Connections of the dorsal margin of the PV were neuroanatomically identified using wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) with electrophysiological techniques. Injection of WGA-HRP into the dorsal margin of the PV demonstrated anterograde labels distributed from the most dorsomedial portion of the posteromedial ventral nucleus (VPM) to the dorsolateral portion of the parvicellular part of the VPM, and retrograde labels in the superficial layers of the caudal subnucleus of the spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpVc). Injection of WGA-HRP in the most dorsomedial portion of the VPM demonstrated retrogradely labeled cells in the dorsal margin of the PV {{as well as in}} the superficial layers of the SpVc. Tracer injection into the superficial layers of the SpVc resulted in anterograde labels in the dorsal margin of the PV {{as well as in the}} dorsomedial portion of the VPM. These findings show that neurons in the PV respond to innocuous thermal stimulation of the trigeminal field and suggest that the dorsal margin of the PV is a possible new relay for the tongue thermal sense, receiving thermal information from the superficial layers of the SpVc, the primary <b>thermal</b> <b>relay</b> for the trigeminal field, and passing the information to the thalamic relay...|$|E
40|$|Concentrated {{purchasing}} {{patterns of}} plug-in vehicles {{may result in}} localized distribution transformer overload scenarios. Prolonged periods of transformer overloading causes service life decrements, and in worst-case scenarios, results in tripped <b>thermal</b> <b>relays</b> and residential service outages. This analysis will review distribution transformer load models developed in the IEC 60076 standard, and apply the model to a neighborhood with plug-in hybrids. Residential distribution transformers are sized such that night-time cooling provides thermal recovery from heavy load conditions during the daytime utility peak. It is expected that PHEVs will primarily be charged at night in a residential setting. If not managed properly, some distribution transformers could become overloaded, leading {{to a reduction in}} transformer life expectancy, thus increasing costs to utilities and consumers. A Monte-Carlo scheme simulated each day of the year, evaluating 100 load scenarios as it swept through the following variables: number of vehicle per transformer, transformer size, and charging rate. A general method for determining expected transformer aging rate will be developed, based on the energy needs of plug-in vehicles loading a residential transformer...|$|R
50|$|A {{second type}} of <b>thermal</b> {{overload}} <b>relay</b> uses a eutectic alloy, like a solder, to retain a spring-loaded contact. When too much current passes through the heating element for too long a time, the alloy melts and the spring releases the contact, opening the control circuit and shutting down the motor. Since eutectic alloy elements are not adjustable, they are resistant to casual tampering but require changing the heater coil element to match the motor rated current.|$|R
30|$|In an {{electric}} power system, over current or excess current {{is a situation}} where the value larger than intended electric current exists through a conductor, leading to excessive generation of heat which leads to the risk of fire or damage to equipment [5 – 7]. Possible causes for over current include short circuit, excessive load, incorrect design, or a ground fault. Fuses, circuit breakers, temperature sensors and current limiters are commonly used protection mechanisms to control the risks of over current. Over current protection also includes the protection against over loads and this is most widely used protection. Over loading of a machine (or equipment) means the machine is taking more current than its rated current. Hence, with overloading there is an associated temperature rise. The permissible temperature rise has a limit based on insulation class and material. Over current protection against overload is generally provided by <b>thermal</b> <b>relays.</b> Over current protection also includes protection against short-circuit. Short circuits may leads to phase faults, earth faults or winding faults. Short circuit currents are generally several times more than full load current. Hence fast fault clearance is always desirable at the time of short-circuits.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{alloying}} Cr, Ni, Co, Fe and Ge on the reversible mould storage effect and its conditioning phase transformation in alloys Mn - Cu has been studied. The isolation of embrittling phases influencing the workability of alloys has been investigated. More than 40 alloys, both binary and alloyed ones (three- and four-component), have been examined. It {{has been found}} out that at alloying Cr, Co and Ge {{the signs of the}} first-kind phase transition become stronger, while at alloying Ni, and Fe the second-kind phase transitions do. The enhancement of the signs of the first-kind phase transition causes the increase in thermal sensitivity of alloys Mn - Cu. The effect of Cr, Ni, Co, Fe and Ge on the isolation of the embrittling phases, mechanical properties and the workability has been studied. A scientific basis for developing reversible mould storage alloys with higher characteristics has been created.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>thermal</b> {{overload}} <b>relay.</b> In one type, a bi-metallic strip located close to a heater deflects as the heater temperature rises until it mechanically causes the device to trip and open the circuit, cutting power to the motor should it become overloaded. A thermal overload will accommodate the brief high starting current of a motor while accurately protecting it from a running current overload. The heater coil and the action of the bi-metallic strip introduce a time delay that affords the motor time to start and settle into normal running current without the thermal overload tripping. Thermal overloads can be manually or automatically resettable depending on their application and have an adjuster that allows them to be accurately set to the motor run current.|$|R
50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with <b>thermal</b> overload <b>relays.</b> Bi-metal <b>thermal</b> overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|R
40|$|Vertebrate ectotherms such as {{reptiles}} provide ideal organisms for {{the study}} of adaptation to environmental thermal change. Comparative genomic and exomic studies can recover markers that diverge between warm and cold adapted lineages, but the genes that are functionally related to thermal adaptation may be difficult to identify. We here used a bioinformatics genome-mining approach to predict and identify functions for suitable candidate markers for thermal adaptation in the chicken. We first established a framework of candidate functions for such markers, and then compiled the literature on genes known to adapt to the thermal environment in different lineages of vertebrates. We then identified them in the genomes of human, chicken, and the lizard Anolis carolinensis, and established a functional genetic interaction network in the chicken. Surprisingly, markers initially identified from diverse lineages of vertebrates such as human and fish were all in close functional relationship with each other and more associated than expected by chance. This indicates that the general genetic functional network for thermoregulation and/or thermal adaptation to the environment might be regulated via similar evolutionarily conserved pathways in different vertebrate lineages. We were able to identify seven functions that were statistically overrepresented in this network, corresponding to four of our originally predicted functions plus three unpredicted functions. We describe this network as multimodal: central regulator genes with the function of <b>relaying</b> <b>thermal</b> signal (1), affect genes with different cellular functions, namely (2) lipoprotein metabolism, (3) membrane channels, (4) stress response, (5) response to oxidative stress, (6) muscle contraction and relaxation, and (7) vasodilation, vasoconstriction and regulation of blood pressure. This network constitutes a novel resource {{for the study}} of thermal adaptation in the closely related nonavian reptiles and other vertebrate ectotherms...|$|R
40|$|Hypothermia {{contributes}} to neonatal {{morbidity and mortality}} in low-income countries, yet {{little is known about}} thermal care practices in rural African settings. We assessed adoption and community acceptability of recommended thermal care practices in rural Tanzania. A multi-method qualitative study, enhanced with survey data. For the qualitative component we triangulated birth narrative interviews with focus group discussions with mothers and traditional birth attendants. Results were then contrasted to related quantitative data. Qualitative analyses sought to identify themes linked to a) immediately drying and wrapping of the baby; b) bathing practices, including delaying for at least 6 hours and using warm water; c) day to day care such as covering the baby's head, covering the baby; and d) keeping the baby skin-to-skin. Quantitative data (n = 22, 243 women) on the <b>thermal</b> care practices <b>relayed</b> by mothers who had delivered in the last year are reported accordingly. 42 % of babies were dried and 27 % wrapped within five minutes of birth mainly due to an awareness that this reduced cold. The main reason for delayed wrapping and drying was not attending to the baby until the placenta was delivered. 45 % of babies born at a health facility and 19 % born at home were bathed six or more hours after birth. The main reason for delayed bathing was health worker advice. The main reason for early bathing believed that the baby is dirty, particularly if the baby had an obvious vernix as this was believed to be sperm. On the other hand, keeping the baby warm and covered day-to-day was considered normal practice. Skin-to-skin care was not a normalised practice, and some respondents wondered if it might be harmful to fragile newborns. Most thermal care behaviours needed improving. Many sub-optimal practices had cultural and symbolic origins. Drying the baby on birth was least symbolically imbued, although resisted by prioritizing of the mothers. Both practical interventions, for instance, having more than one attendant to help both mother and baby, and culturally anchored sensitization are recommended...|$|R
40|$|The Compact Muon Solenoid, as well {{as other}} {{experiments}} within the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, will undergo a vast redesign during the decade of 2010. The main reasons behind this overhaul are to improve accuracy and longevity of the individual experiments. The physics experiments are poised to move beyond the current capabilities of the experiments. The energies involved in the particle collisions will outpace the operating capabilities of the current experiments without a major upgrade. The main objective of the work done within the scope of this thesis was to develop the design of the new sensor modules and their mechanical aspects. The thesis covers an introduction into the current Compact Muon Solenoid detector. The main content is the progress done with the module design of the next generation tracker modules. These new modules will be installed in next incarnation of the Compact Muon Solenoid. The development work depicted in this thesis was done between June 2012 and December 2013. The new sensor modules and their designs progressed from preliminary ideas into concrete design options during the writing of this thesis. 3 D models were created with increasing accuracy and exercises on populating the required volume inside the CMS were made using the new module designs. One of the most significant advances was the simplification of <b>thermal</b> pathways for <b>relaying</b> excess heat out of the delicate components and into a cooling solution outside the volume. The inclusion of a new alloy of aluminium and carbon fibre {{played a significant role in}} the success of this aspect. Two separate types of modules were developed with differing approaches to and geometrical designs: 2 S and PS –modules. Current inner tracker design within the CMS includes modules mounted parallel to the beamline. This leads to inefficient use of the module’s sensing surfaces. A great deal of design effort was put into designing alternative ways for incorporating the new modules in a more efficient way into the inner tracker volume. A significant reduction of the number of required modules is to be expected if the design proves feasible...|$|R
