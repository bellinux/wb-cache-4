Swift conceived the song while touring as opening act {{in order to promote}} her eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006). While writing the song, she was not dating anyone or [...] "even in the beginning stages of dating anybody." [...] She wrote the song after she analyzed the ideology of what was the best first date. While developing [...] "Fearless", Swift explained the writing process, stating, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> when you’re writing love songs, you don’t write them about what you’re going through at the moment, you write about what you wish you had." [...] The song was composed with two concepts in mind. Swift described the song's primary concept to be about [...] "the fearlessness of falling in love", and [...] "no matter how many times you get hurt, you will always fall in love again." [...] The second, is about the best first date, which Swift stated she hadn't experienced at the time of writing [...] "Fearless". After completing the song, Swift deeply deliberated her personal definition of the word [...] "fearless". To her, [...] "fearless doesn't mean you're completely unafraid and it doesn't mean that you're bulletproof. It means that {{you have a lot of}} fears, but you jump anyway." [...] That influenced her to title the album Fearless. The song was first released as a promotional single from the album on October 14, 2008 as part of Countdown to Fearless an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; it was later released as the fifth and final single from Fearless on January 4, 2010.|$|E

On screen, it causes a rift between Tony and Ziva, {{as well as a}} violent confrontation between the two in the season finale. Cote de Pablo described Tony's actions as [...] "almost unforgivable" [...] from her character's perspective despite their being in self-defense and stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> when people make mistakes, they can be impulsive and judge someone on one particular thing. Ziva isn't overreacting—Tony did kill someone who {{was a big part of}} her life—but, at the time, she couldn't see clearly." ...|$|E

[...] When filming Chamber of Secrets, Watson was [...] "adamant" [...] that she wasn't like Hermione, but she reflects that [...] "as I got older, I realised she was the greatest role model a girl could have." [...] In 2007, before the release of Order of the Phoenix, Watson said, [...] "There are too many stupid girls in the media. Hermione's not scared to be clever. I <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> really smart girls dumb themselves down a bit, and that's bad. When I was nine or ten, I would get really upset {{when they tried to}} make me look geeky, but now I absolutely love it. I find it's so much pressure to be beautiful. Hermione doesn't care what she looks like. She's a complete tomboy." ...|$|E

[...] " [...] are two very passionate camps. And don't think I don't know it," [...] {{acknowledged}} Schwahn. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> one camp thinks they're being ignored." [...] Schwahn said that although he designed Lucas and Peyton to be together from the start, this did not preclude Brooke and Lucas ending up together, {{and that he was}} aware of the [...] "great chemistry" [...] between their portrayers, real-life ex-spouses Murray and Bush. He was not stubbornly holding on to the idea of [...] Schwahn said the Peyton-Lucas-Brooke love triangle is also by design and became a staple of the show. [...] "There is a huge fanbase dedicated to Brooke and Lucas, and sometimes [...] feel a bit betrayed, just as the fanbase dedicated to Peyton and Lucas felt betrayed [...] ", said Schwahn. [...] "That tells me that we've done things correctly– that's the strength of a love triangle." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nick {{has been}} {{described}} by EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer as [...] "the show's premier villain". An EastEnders Revealed documentary chronicling the character's time on the show deemed him a liar, a thief and a murderer who [...] "thrived on the pain and the misery of those near to him". Co-star Charlie Clements (Bradley Branning) has stated: [...] "You think of soap bad guys, Nick Cotton is definitely up there with the best of them", while Leslie Grantham (Den Watts) opined that [...] "There is no redeeming feature about Nick Cotton whatsoever". This assessment is shared by series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has explained: [...] "It's good to have an out and out villain. I <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> you can get a character and go 'Oh, they should have a good side as well, and maybe we should redeem them a little bit.' With Nick, it doesn’t matter. You can go full pelt, foot-on-the-accelerator bad guy." [...] John Altman has discussed the fact that he cannot remember his character ever once being nice, blaming Nick's unruliness on his father's absence during his childhood. Santer has discussed the [...] "wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship" [...] Nick shares with his mother, Dot Cotton, and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance, regardless of his history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: [...] "There's that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone's changed, which is really tragic. They’ve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they’ll have changed." [...] Grantham has stated that Dot is the [...] "one friend in [...] life", while Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: [...] "Dot's always going to forgive him. And that's the beauty of Nick and Dot." [...] Concurring with this sentiment, Altman agreed: [...] "No matter what he does, she’ll forgive him. So did a lot of gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably Al Capone's mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know." ...|$|E
