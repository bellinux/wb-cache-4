5|$|In 1867 the {{formerly}} independent Hammersmith and City Railway was {{absorbed by the}} Metropolitan Railway and the Great Western Railway, and was operated from then on by Metropolitan Railway trains. The plan for a terminus in Fulham was abandoned, and the line instead turned west at Hammersmith <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>over</b> London and South Western Railway tracks to Richmond. Although Wandsworth Town railway station, near {{the southern end of}} the bridge, had provided direct connections to central London since 1846, the lack of rail connections opening on the north bank meant the area on the Fulham side remained undeveloped, and bridge usage was low. Tolmé's design was not sturdy enough to carry heavy vehicles, and drainage problems on the approach road to the north discouraged vehicles from using Wandsworth Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, the C {{submitted}} another {{bill for}} Parliamentary consideration seeking {{to increase its}} capacity by enlarging its tunnels to the larger diameter used for the tunnels of the more recently built railways to allow larger, more modern rolling stock to be used. A separate bill was published {{at the same time}} by the London Electric Railway (LER, a company formed by the UERL in 1910 through a merger of the BS, GNP and CCE), which included plans to construct tunnels to connect the C at Euston to the CCE's station at Camden Town. Together, the works proposed in these bills would enable the CCE's trains <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>over</b> the C's route and vice versa, effectively combining the two separate railways.|$|E

Tunnel enlargement works only restarted after World War I when an extension of time was granted in February 1919.

50|$|Raised in Lucy, Louisiana, 25 mi west of New Orleans, Robiskie went {{to nearby}} Second Ward High School in Edgard, Louisiana, {{where he was}} a star quarterback. After high school, he went to Louisiana State University, where was {{converted}} to a running back for LSU's football team. During his senior year, in 1976, he a first-team All-SEC running back. He was the first LSU running back <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for <b>over</b> 200 yards in a single game, gaining 214 yards in 30 attempts against Rice University in 1976. He was also the first LSU running back <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for <b>over</b> 1,000 yards in a season (1976), and the first LSU running back <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for <b>over</b> 2,500 yards in a career (1973-76).|$|R
5|$|The nuckelavee is {{the most}} malevolent of the demons {{in and around the}} Scottish islands, without any redeeming characteristics. The only entity able to control it is the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient spirit in Orcadian mythology who keeps the nuckelavee {{confined}} during the summer months. In common with other mythical sea monsters, {{with the possible exception of}} kelpies and the nuggle of Shetland, it is unable to wade through fresh flowing water, therefore it can be escaped by crossing a stream. Tammas managed to escape from the nuckelavee after he inadvertently splashed it with water from the loch he was alongside; this briefly distracted the monster, allowing Tammas <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>over</b> to a nearby channel of fresh water and jump to safety on the opposite bank.|$|E
5|$|On November 7, 1998, Amtrak {{extended}} the Pennsylvanian through to Chicago {{along the route}} of the Capitol Limited via Toledo, finally bringing a daylight connection to Cleveland. The Three Rivers continued <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>over</b> a different schedule via Akron and Fostoria. As part of the change Amtrak truncated the eastern end to Philadelphia, enabling the train to complete the run within a single day. The change was driven by Amtrak's growing mail and express business; Pittsburgh–Philadelphia ridership suffered. Amtrak returned the Pennsylvanian to the New YorkPittsburgh route on January 27, 2003, citing low ridership and Amtrak's withdrawal from the express freight business. On November 1, 2004, Amtrak merged the Pennsylvanian and Three Rivers, keeping the latter name with a western terminus in Chicago. Amtrak had sought $2.5million in assistance from Pennsylvania to keep both trains running. On March 8, 2005, Amtrak truncated service to PittsburghNew York and restored the Pennsylvanian name to the route.|$|E
5|$|Chris Boucher {{began his}} {{television}} writing career in comedy, working on such programmes as Dave Allen at Large and Romany Jones, {{before moving on}} to write for drama series, including Shoestring, Juliet Bravo and Bergerac. He was no stranger to television science fiction, having written three serials for Doctor Who and having acted as script editor on the entire four season run of Blake's 7 as well as writing nine episodes for it himself. Boucher originally pitched Star Cops to the BBC in 1981 as a radio series but, with James Follet's epic Earthsearch serial in production that year, it was felt that science fiction was adequately served in the schedules and so Boucher tried to sell it to television instead. He sent the draft script of the first Star Cops story to Jonathan Powell, the Head of Drama at BBC television. Powell responded asking Boucher to write a second script and on the strength of this the series was commissioned. However, Powell insisted that the first story, which Boucher had intended <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>over</b> two episodes, be reworked into a single episode. This would be the first of many difficulties Boucher would have with how Star Cops was eventually realised for the screen. Boucher, who at this time was working as script editor on the crime series Bergerac, was also told by Powell he could work on Star Cops or on Bergerac but not on both and so chose to leave Bergerac.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, the Corporation {{had made}} {{enquiries}} about purchasing a second-hand steam engine, approaching six locomotive manufacturers, but eventually acquired a new 0-4-0 saddle tank from Peckett and Sons Ltd, {{which was built}} at their Bristol works in 1918. The original engine became a spare, but was hired out to the Blackburn Meadows power station in March 1936. A year later it was condemned by the insurance company, and was sold for scrap to Maden and McKee Ltd, who were based in Liverpool. A replacement was sought, and a third 0-4-0 saddle tank, made by Hudswell Clarke in 1914, was bought from the Olympia Oil and Cake Company at Selby. It was coupled into a goods train, and arrived at the works in July 1937. At the works, as at Selby, it carried the name Olympia, painted on the tanks. The Peckett was overhauled by the Yorkshire Engine Company at Meadow Hall Works between 1945 and 1946. Because there was a statutory obligation to keep the treatment works operational, a special dispensation was obtained during the 1926 general strike, to allow this engine <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>over</b> the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip. Kilnhurst tip eventually became full, and in January 1948, regular tipping operations ceased, after a new tip at Thrybergh opened. Tipping continued at Kilnhurst sporadically, until it was closed in 1959. During its operational life up to 1948, 2,917,480 tons of sewage sludge was dumped at the site, and following closure, it was sold to the National Coal Board in 1961.|$|E
