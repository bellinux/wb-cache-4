5|$|President Bill Clinton {{proposed}} a healthcare reform bill in 1993 {{that included a}} mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of health maintenance organizations. Republican Senators {{proposed a}}n alternative that would have required individuals, but not employers, to buy insurance. Ultimately the Clinton plan failed amid an unprecedented barrage of negative advertising funded by politically conservative groups and <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> industry and due to concerns that it was overly complex. Clinton negotiated a compromise with the 105th Congress to instead enact the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in 1997.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 the U.S. {{court ruled}} in U.S. v. One Package that {{medically}} prescribing contraception {{to save a}} persons life or well being was not illegal under the Comstock Law; following this decision, the American Medical Association Committee on Contraception revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control. A national survey in 1937 showed 71 percent {{of the adult population}} supported the use of contraception. By 1938 347 birth control clinics were running in the United States despite their advertisement still being illegal. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly supported birth control and family planning. In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson started endorsing public funding for family planning services, and the Federal Government began subsidizing birth control services for low-income families. The Affordable Care Act, passed into law on March 23, 2010 under President Barack Obama, requires all plans in <b>the</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> Marketplace to cover contraceptive methods. These include barrier methods, hormonal methods, implanted devices, emergency contraceptives, and sterilization procedures.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Malawi's Ministry of Health and Population began {{developing}} {{a plan to}} distribute antiretroviral drugs to the population, and, as of 2003, there were several sites providing antiretroviral drugs in Malawi. The Lighthouse, a trust in Lilongwe that fights HIV/AIDS, provides antiretroviral drugs {{at a cost of}} 2,500 kwacha per month. Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre provides antiretroviral therapy through its outpatient department, and Médecins Sans Frontières distributes antiretroviral drugs to patients for free in the Chiradzulu and Thyolo Districts. Many different private providers sell antiretroviral drugs, particularly in cities; however, very few patients can afford to receive drugs from the private sector in Malawi. In addition, private providers are not currently required to obtain certification before selling antiretroviral drugs, and, therefore, this practice is not closely monitored. Finally, some employees receive access to antiretroviral drugs through <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> policies provided by their employers, but this practice is not widespread.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, <b>the</b> Chilean <b>health</b> sector {{suffered}} a deep reform, establishing a new scheme with two sectors: <b>the</b> public <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> and many private <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies. This essay analyzes a especial outcome in <b>the</b> Chilean <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> sector: <b>the</b> {{majority of the people}} within <b>the</b> public <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> belong to a group with low incomes and high risk, noticing the opposite situation in <b>the</b> private <b>health</b> system. This paper develops a two-sector model based on the standard insurance theory, which explains the reasons why people choose between <b>the</b> public <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> and a private <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> given <b>the</b> rules and game of both sub-systems. ...|$|R
5|$|On September 22, 1993, Clinton {{made a major}} {{speech to}} Congress {{regarding}} a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This {{was one of the}} most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris stated that the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House. Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.|$|E

25|$|On 1 February 1984, the {{original}} Medibank model was reinstated by the Hawke Labor government, but renamed Medicare to {{distinguish it from}} Medibank Private which continued to exist. The major changes introduced by the Fraser government were largely reversed, although the financing arrangements were changed. Medicare, which came into effect on 1 February 1984, followed the passage in September 1983 of the Health Legislation Amendment Act 1983, including amendments to <b>the</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953 and <b>the</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> Commission Act 1973.|$|E

There was opposition to the system from the Liberal-Country Party Coalition-controlled Senate. <b>The</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> Bill 1973 and the accompanying bills were rejected by the Senate on three occasions (12 December 1973, 2 April 1974 and 18 July 1974). The Medibank legislation was one of the bills which resulted in a double dissolution of Parliament on 11 April 1974, and was passed at a subsequent joint sitting of Parliament on 7 August 1974. The original Medibank scheme was to be financed by a 1.35% levy (with low income exemptions) but the bills were rejected by the Senate, and so Medibank was originally funded from general revenue.|$|E

The majority of Americans have private <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> with a very large proportion of <b>the</b> private <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> offered as part of an employee compensation packaged administered through the workplace. For example, in 2009, 169.7 million (87%) of the 194.5 million people with private coverage were getting their coverage from their employers.|$|R

40|$|In 2009 a {{so-called}} morbidity orientated risk structure equalization scheme was installed for <b>the</b> German statutory <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> {{in order to}} minimize structural differences between different providers with respect to revenue and expenditures. Even with this mechanism some risks to <b>the</b> individual <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> providers remain. Reinsurance could be a way to mitigate these risks, but so far only very few contracts have been signed. Moreover the existing reinsurance contracts only focus on the periphery of <b>the</b> statutory <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> system such as travel <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> In this article we therefore analyse existing risks for individual <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> providers and evaluate their (re-) insurability. Hereafter the potential for reinsurance solutions in <b>the</b> German statutory <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> itself as well as in newer forms of healthcare provision (e. g. integrated health care and managed care) is discussed.
