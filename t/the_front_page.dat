40|$|This master’s thesis {{examined}} {{the concepts of}} health found in visual bodily representations on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of Danish fitness magazines from 1981 to 2011. Furthermore it was examined whether the bodily concepts of health on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of <b>the</b> magazines were similar to or deviated from contemporary official concepts of health. On {{the basis of an}} examination of all Danish fitness magazines occurring during the period 1981 to 2011, 8 <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> were picked out representing 4 intersection periods. These were 1981 - 84, 1987 - 92, 1996 - 2000 and 2005 - 2011. These 8 <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> were analysed with the semiotic conceptual framework presented in Jostein Gripsruds book Mediekultur, Mediesamfund (Gripsrud, 2005). I found, that <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> from 1981 - 84 in general focused on health as an idyllic muscle oriented body project which had almost no resemblance to concurrent official concepts of health. After the groundbreaking introduction of iFORM in 1987, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> however found common denominators with the official concepts of health in a growing individualization, risk-orientation and lifestylization in the visual body representations of health concepts. With the emergence of Aktiv Træning in 2008 another paradigmatic break could be discerned, in which the human body increasingly seemed to be replaced by technologies like pulse-watches and bike-computers, which reduced the concepts of health to cold numbers on displays without any visual connections to the human body in flesh and blood. Despite similarities between <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> and contemporary official concepts of health, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> always appear to be one step ahead and use a more radical expression of their bodily concepts of health. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> of <b>the</b> fitness magazines therefore seem to offer a little exclusive insight into the tendencies of forthcoming policies of health. Finally I must conclude, that despite the diligent selection of <b>the</b> 8 <b>front</b> <b>pages,</b> this master’s thesis cannot be seen an exhaustive examination of all Danish fitness magazines from 1981 - 2011. Further examination of this field is therefore needed...|$|R

5|$|A {{significant}} difference between the community components in Miami and California was that both Los Angeles and San Francisco had very active and visible gay communities.

Hollywood stars Bette Midler, Lily Tomlin, and Richard Pryor came out in force for the cause, raising another $100,000. In January 1978 Harvey Milk took office as a supervisor of San Francisco, and the first openly gay man to be elected to office in California. Briggs campaigned for the measure throughout the state, and held a series of public and televised debates with Milk who was very well received by the media, quick to quip and give print-friendly comments. He often made <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>page</b> in newspapers in San Francisco with the outrageous things he said.
