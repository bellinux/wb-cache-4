25|$|A Cadbury Creme Egg is a {{chocolate}} product {{produced in the}} shape of an egg. <b>The</b> <b>product</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> a thick chocolate shell, housing a white and orange fondant filling which mimics the albumen and yolk of a chicken egg. The Creme Eggs are the best selling confectionery item between New Year's Day and Easter in the UK, with annual sales in excess of 200 million and a brand value of approximately £55 million. However, in 2016 sales plummeted after the controversial decision to change the recipe from the original Dairy Milk chocolate to a cheaper substitute, with reports of a loss of more than £6m in sales.|$|E
25|$|The Chichibabin {{pyridine}} synthesis {{was reported}} in 1924 and is still in use in industry. In its general form, the reaction {{can be described as}} a condensation reaction of aldehydes, ketones, α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, or any combination of the above, in ammonia or ammonia derivatives. In particular, unsubstituted pyridine is produced from formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which are inexpensive and widely available. First, acrolein is formed in a Knoevenagel condensation from the acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. It is then condensed with acetaldehyde and ammonia into dihydropyridine, and then oxidized with a solid-state catalyst to pyridine. This process is carried out in a gas phase at 400–450°C. <b>The</b> <b>product</b> <b>consists</b> <b>of</b> a mixture of pyridine, simple methylated pyridines (picoline), and lutidine; its composition depends on the catalyst used and can be adapted {{to the needs of the}} manufacturer. The catalyst is usually a transition metal salt such as cadmium(II) fluoride or manganese(II) fluoride, but cobalt and thallium compounds can also be used. The recovered pyridine is separated from byproducts in a multistage process.|$|E
