5000|$|The Berlin S-Bahn {{commuter}} rail system {{has its own}} tracks that is completely separate from the national rail network although most lines run in parallel with the normal railways. Although a heavy rail system the vehicle fleet is specialized for the Berlin rail network with its closest cousins in the S-Bahn Hamburg (which switched to 1200 Volt however instead of 750 Volt third rail in Berlin). Berlin {{was among the first}} to introduce an automated train protection system based on metal bar at the height of the first bogie where the trip cock is placed. The metal bar (also named [...] "Streckenanschlag" [...] / <b>track</b> <b>stop</b> collar) folds away to allow passing. If the metal bar is up it will also catch the train by sliding along the outer frame. The train stops are installed at some distance before the actual critical point (junction, station) so that with an assumed maximum speed the train can be halted.|$|E
50|$|The {{lineup of}} Franklin, Williams, Street, Tyson, and Edwards {{proved to be}} short-lived. The five {{performed}} on Motown 25 and released the direct to video The Temptations: Live in Concert (filmed at Harrah's Atlantic City). The album Back to Basics, released later in 1983, was the first album featuring Ron Tyson on lead. Sail Away, produced by a returning Norman Whitfield and featuring Ron Tyson's first lead vocal, peaked at number 13. In addition, a then-relatively unknown singer/musician, Ali-Ollie Woodson was featured on one <b>track,</b> <b>Stop</b> the World Right Here (I Wanna Get Off). Woodson was a Detroit native {{who had been a}} potential candidate to replace Dennis Edwards back in 1977. Meanwhile, Edwards (who also had his share of lead vocals on the Back to Basics album) was again fired in 1984, for missing rehearsals or showing up hungover. He then attempted a second solo career, scoring a hit with the 1984 single Don't Look Any Further, a duet with Siedah Garrett. At this point, Woodson officially joined the group, taking Edwards' place. Woodson's first lead on a single was 1984's Treat Her Like a Lady, co-written by himself and Otis Williams, and co-produced by former Earth, Wind & Fire members Al McKay and Ralph Johnson. The single became their biggest success on R&B radio since 1975, reaching number-two on the R&B charts, and just missing the Pop Top 40 at number 48. The group enjoyed further successes with 1985's Do You Really Love Your Baby, a number 14 R&B hit co-written by soul star Luther Vandross, and 1986's Lady Soul, the group's third and final Top 10 R&B hit of the decade.|$|E
40|$|Fraud Analytics Using Descriptive, Predictive, and Social Network Techniques is an {{authoritative}} guidebook {{for setting up}} a comprehensive fraud detection analytics solution. Early detection is {{a key factor in}} mitigating fraud damage, but it involves more specialized techniques than detecting fraud at the more advanced stages. This invaluable guide details both the theory and technical aspects of these techniques, and provides expert insight into streamlining implementation. Coverage includes data gathering, preprocessing, model building, and post-implementation, with comprehensive guidance on various learning techniques and the data types utilized by each. These techniques are effective for fraud detection across industry boundaries, including applications in insurance fraud, credit card fraud, anti-money laundering, healthcare fraud, telecommunications fraud, click fraud, tax evasion, and more, giving you a highly practical framework for fraud prevention. It is estimated that a typical organization loses about 5 % of its revenue to fraud every year. More effective fraud detection is possible, and this book describes the various analytical techniques your organization must implement {{to put a stop to}} the revenue leak. •	Examine fraud patterns in historical data •	Utilize labeled, unlabeled, and networked data •	Detect fraud before the damage cascades •	Reduce losses, increase recovery, and tighten security The longer fraud is allowed to go on, the more harm it causes. It expands exponentially, sending ripples of damage throughout the organization, and becomes more and more complex to <b>track,</b> <b>stop,</b> and reverse. Fraud prevention relies on early and effective fraud detection, enabled by the techniques discussed here. Fraud Analytics Using Descriptive, Predictive, and Social Network Techniques helps you stop fraud in its tracks, and eliminate the opportunities for future occurrence. edition: 1 stnrpages: 384 status: publishe...|$|E
