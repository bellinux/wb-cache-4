5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} can be {{described}} by the ovarian or uterine cycle. The ovarian cycle describes changes <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> follicles of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the endometrial lining of the uterus. Both cycles {{can be divided into}} three phases. The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.|$|E
5|$|A large {{percentage}} of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event; rather than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that occurs at the moment of trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E

5|$|Epilepsy cannot {{usually be}} cured, but {{medication}} can control seizures effectively in about 70% of cases. Of those with generalized seizures, more than 80% can be well controlled with medications {{while this is}} true in only 50% of people with focal seizures. One predictor of long-term outcome {{is the number of}} seizures <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first six months. Other factors increasing the risk of a poor outcome include little response to the initial treatment, generalized seizures, a family history of epilepsy, psychiatric problems, and waves on the EEG representing generalized epileptiform activity. In the developing world, 75% of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated. In Africa, 90% do not get treatment. This is partly related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical cyclones, {{sometimes}} called mid-latitude cyclones or wave cyclones, are low-pressure areas which, {{along with the}} anticyclones of high-pressure areas, drive the weather {{over much of the}} Earth. Extratropical cyclones are capable of producing anything from cloudiness and mild showers to heavy gales, thunderstorms, blizzards, and tornadoes. These types of cyclones are defined as large scale (synoptic) low pressure weather systems <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle latitudes of the Earth. In contrast with tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones produce rapid changes in temperature and dew point along broad lines, called weather fronts, about the center of the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Mucinous, clear {{secretions}} may collect {{within these}} cysts to form either spherical masses or fusiform swellings, rarely larger than 2 to 3cm in diameter. These {{are present in}} the midline of the neck anterior to the trachea. Segments of the duct and cysts that occur high in the neck are lined by stratified squamous epithelium, which is essentially identical to that covering the posterior portion of the tongue in the region of the foramen cecum. The disorders <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower neck more proximal to the thyroid gland are lined by epithelium resembling the thyroidal acinar epithelium. Characteristically, next to the lining epithelium, there is an intense lymphocytic infiltrate. Superimposed infection may convert these lesions into abscess cavities, and rarely, give rise to cancers.|$|E

5|$|Rivers {{and streams}} in the Colorado basin were once home to 49 species of native fish, of which 42 were endemic. Engineering {{projects}} and river regulation {{have led to}} the extinction of four species and severe declines in the populations of 40 species. Bonytail chub, razorback sucker, Colorado pikeminnow, and humpback chub are among those considered the most at risk; all are unique to the Colorado River system and well adapted to the river's natural silty conditions and flow variations. Clear, cold water released by dams has significantly changed characteristics of habitat for these and other Colorado River basin fishes. A further 40 species <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river today, notably the brown trout, were introduced during the 19th and 20thcenturies, mainly for sport fishing.|$|E

5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German. Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> standard English spellings of commonly used words. Such instruction greatly {{reduces the risk of}} children experiencing reading difficulties in English. Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.|$|E

5|$|The cytosol is {{the site}} of most {{metabolism}} in prokaryotes, and {{a large proportion of the}} metabolism of eukaryotes. For instance, in mammals about half of the proteins in the cell are localized to the cytosol. The most complete data are available in yeast, where metabolic reconstructions indicate that the majority of both metabolic processes and metabolites occur in the cytosol. Major metabolic pathways <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cytosol in animals are protein biosynthesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

5|$|The {{headwaters}} of the Snake River and the high mountains elsewhere in the watershed were historically heavily forested. These include aspen, Douglas fir, and spruce fir, comprising about 20% of the historic watershed. At the base of mountains and in the Lost River basin, sagebrush was and is the predominant vegetation cover. Because of deforestation, up to {{one quarter of the}} forests have been taken over by sagebrush, leaving the remaining forests to cover about 15% of the watershed. However, the lodgepole pine has increased in number, taking over historic stands of other conifers. There are also up to 118 species of rare or endemic plants <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Snake River watershed.|$|E
5|$|The {{risks and}} {{complications}} related to implant therapy divide into those that occur during surgery (such as excessive bleeding or nerve injury), those <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{first six months}} (such as infection and failure to osseointegrate) and those that occur long-term (such as peri-implantitis and mechanical failures). In the presence of healthy tissues, a well-integrated implant with appropriate biomechanical loads can have 5-year plus survival rates from 93 to 98 percent and 10 to 15 year lifespans for the prosthetic teeth. Long-term studies show a 16- to 20-year success (implants surviving without complications or revisions) between 52% and 76%, with complications occurring up to 48% of the time.|$|E

5|$|Many {{reviews for}} DJ Hero felt the {{addition}} of the non-scoring freeform samples during certain parts of mixes were unnecessary and difficult to use, and with the limited number of samples available, ultimately would lead to overuse and make the mixes sound worse. Reviewers were critical of the game's lackluster multiplayer modes. The DJ-vs-DJ mode was considered poor as both players play the same mix, in consideration of current band-based music games where different players can play different parts of a song. This leads to minimal engagement between players, with each just attempting to maximize their score whenever possible on the controller. While some reviewers considered the DJ-vs-Guitar modes to be fun, others felt it was more a novelty due to the current tracks offered for this mode in the game. The game's graphics were also considered as a negative, often using many strobing lights and creating concerns about possible epilepic seizures that could occur while watching the game. The character designs of the non-celebrity avatars also continued to have the same Muppet-like appearances <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Guitar Hero series, and are overly stereotyped.|$|E
5|$|Strokes <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{brainstem}} {{may cause}} profound deficits, including locked-in syndrome, in which cognitive, emotional and linguistic abilities remain intact but all or almost all voluntary motor abilities are lost. Most people {{affected by this}} type of stroke rely on AAC strategies to communicate, since few recover intelligible speech or functional voice. The AAC strategies used vary with the individual's preferences and motor capabilities which may change over time. As eye movements {{are most likely to}} be preserved, eye blinks are frequently used for communication. Low-tech alphabet boards are often introduced immediately to provide the individual with basic communication. Partner-assisted scanning may be used, in which the AAC user signals when the desired letter is named by a communication partner. When vertical and horizontal eye movements are functional, a transparent alphabet board may be used in which the AAC user looks at the desired letter and this is acknowledged by the communication partner. Individuals with locked-in syndrome have difficulty using high-tech devices due to issues with motor control, vision, memory, alertness and linguistic ability. In particular, a voluntary, reliable and easily controlled muscle movement is necessary to access such a device, such as head, jaw, hand or finger movements. In some individuals, intensive practice, even long after the initial stroke, has been shown to increase the accuracy and consistency of head movements, which can be used to access a communication device.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} glaciovolcanism {{is still a}} {{relatively}} new field. Early accounts described the unusual flat-topped steep-sided volcanoes (called tuyas) in Iceland that were suggested to have formed from eruptions below ice. The first English-language paper on the subject was published in 1947 by William Henry Mathews, describing the Tuya Butte field in northwest British Columbia, Canada. The eruptive process that builds these structures, originally inferred in the paper, begins with volcanic growth below the glacier. At first the eruptions resemble those <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep sea, forming piles of pillow lava {{at the base of}} the volcanic structure. Some of the lava shatters when it comes in contact with the cold ice, forming a glassy breccia called hyaloclastite. After a while the ice finally melts into a lake, and the more explosive eruptions of Surtseyan activity begins, building up flanks made up of mostly hyaloclastite. Eventually the lake boils off from continued volcanism, and the lava flows become more effusive and thicken as the lava cools much more slowly, often forming columnar jointing. Well-preserved tuyas show all of these stages, for example Hjorleifshofdi in Iceland.|$|E
