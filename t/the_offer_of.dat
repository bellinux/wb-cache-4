An intentionally fantastical story in Maine and claimed hairy trout were under catch and release policy that was enforced by wardens' carrying Brannock Devices. If a fish was caught, the warden would measure it against the fisher's foot. If the fish's length matched the fisher's foot size, the fish could be eaten and the outards made into furry slippers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the staging of Ballo, Verdi was approached by several opera companies seeking a new work or making offers to stage one of his existing ones, but refused them all. But when, in December 1860, an approach was made from Saint Petersburg's Imperial Theatre, <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> 60,000 francs plus all expenses was doubtless a strong incentive. Verdi {{came up with the}} idea of adapting the 1835 Spanish play Don Alvaro o la fuerza del sino by Angel Saavedra, which became La forza del destino, with Piave writing the libretto. The Verdis arrived in St. Petersburg in December 1861 for the premiere, but casting problems meant that it had to be postponed.|$|E

40|$|Central to {{understanding}} the effect of arbitration schemes {{on the process of}} collective bargaining is understanding the process by which arbitrators make decisions. A model of arbitrator behavior inconventional arbitration is developed that allows the arbitration award to be a function <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parties and the(exogenous) facts of the case. The weight that the arbitrator puts on the facts relative to <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> is hypothesized to be a function of <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> as measured by the difference between <b>the</b> <b>offers.</b> Two special cases of this model are derived: 1) the arbitrator bases the award strictly on <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parties(split-the-difference) and 2) the arbitrator bases the award strictly on {{the facts of the case}}. The model is implemented empirically using data gathered from practicing arbitrators regarding their decisions in twenty-five hypothetical cases. These data have the advantage that they allow causal inference regarding the effect on the arbitration award of the facts relative to <b>the</b> <b>offers.</b> On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> the estimates, both of the special case models are strongly rejected. The arbitration awards are found to be influenced by both <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parties and the facts of the case. In addition, the weight put on the facts of the case relative to <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> is found to vary significantly with <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offers.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> are <b>of</b> low quality (far apart) the arbitrator weights the facts more heavily and <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> less heavily. These results suggest that the naive split-the difference view of arbitrator behavior, which is the basis of the critique of conventional arbitration that has led to the adoption of final-offer arbitration, is no correct in its extreme view. On the other hand,the awards are affected by <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> so that <b>the</b> parties can manipulate the outcome to some extent by manipulating their <b>offers.</b> However, <b>the</b> scope for this sort of influence is limited by the finding that <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> are weighted less heavily as their quality deteriorates. ...|$|R
5|$|Many of Model's fellow {{officers}} considered him a Nazi. He frequently harangued his troops {{to have faith}} in the Führer and uphold the virtues of National Socialism. He accepted <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein to appoint a Waffen-SS officer as his adjutant at Army Group North in 1944, after the Heerespersonalamt had refused him an adjutant, and filled the Nationalsozialistischer Führungsoffizier (NSFO, essentially a Nazi political commissar) post at Army Group B that had been vacant before his arrival. His habit of parroting the Führer's orders caused him to be viewed as a sycophant, even if he often undermined or ignored those orders in practice.|$|E

5|$|The Liberal Party's {{decision}} not to enter a coalition with the Conservatives, and Baldwin's unwillingness to govern without a majority, led to Ramsay MacDonald's first minority Labour government which took office in January 1924.

5|$|The {{theoretical}} concerns surrounding throffers {{have been}} practically applied concerning workfare programmes. In such systems, individuals receiving social welfare have their aid decreased if they refuse <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>of</b> work or education. Robert Goodin criticised workfare programmes which presented throffers to individuals receiving welfare, and was responded to by Daniel Shapiro, who found his objections unconvincing. Several writers have also observed that throffers presented to people convicted of crimes, particularly sex offenders, {{can result in}} more lenient sentences if they accept medical treatment. Other examples are offered by psychiatrist Julio Arboleda-Flórez, who presents concerns about throffers in community psychiatry, and management expert John J. Clancey, who talks about throffers in employment.|$|E
