Additionally, PewDiePie posted on Reddit, [...] "I make more than I need from YouTube", adding, [...] "with that freedom, but also to respect my fans for making that possible, I don't end up doing many endorsements." [...] On this topic, PewDiePie has claimed that it is disappointing when {{a large chunk of}} people misinterpret a component of his character; he states, [...] "if I mention on Twitter <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> this or that Kickstarter project cool, people immediately start to ask what economical interests I might have in it.

500|$|As Friedman noted, if {{the price}} of silver had {{remained}} high, the exclusion of the silver dollar from the 1873 act would have been irrelevant. By 1874, the effect of the new mines in the Far West, and the sale of silver in Germany following its demonetization there, combined to force the price of silver down. Silver producers had not been aware of the statutory change, and only learned of it when they sought to present silver at the mints for coining. According to numismatic historian Don Taxay, [...] "an agitation followed, during which several pious Congressmen feigned ignorance of the repeal, maintaining it had been worked into the Mint bill surreptitiously." [...] One Delaware manufacturer wrote to his senator, Thomas F. Bayard, in 1878, [...] "at the beginning... I was totally ignorant of all that related to the silver question—so much in fact <b>that</b> (<b>I</b> <b>find</b> now like almost everyone else not excluding Congressmen!) I did not know Silver had been demonetized." ...|$|E
500|$|When Todd was recast with St. John after Howarth's departure, {{many fans}} felt that like {{the roles of}} Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary) on General Hospital and Erica Kane (Susan Lucci) on All My Children, Todd should be portrayed only by the actor who had {{originated}} the role. [...] As Soap Opera Digest put it, [...] "Few recasts caused more uproar". Soap Opera Digest also stated that while there were fans who [...] "will only consider Howarth to be their beloved Todd", St. John won over many fans by putting a lighter spin on the character. Soap Opera Weekly stated that they were [...] "on board with St. John". [...] Soap Opera Digest agreed, commenting that St. John made the transition believable while adding new facets to the character. The magazine also stated that Todd's new appearance aided in his continuing redemption. [...] Soap opera columnist Jill Berry expressed her approval for the recast, stating, [...] "Trevor's Todd continues to impress me. He has given some sweetness to Todd <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> totally appealing".|$|E

500|$|Before {{starting}} a book Wodehouse would write {{up to four}} hundred pages of notes bringing together an outline of the plot; he acknowledged that [...] "It's the plots <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> so hard to work out. It takes {{such a long time}} to work one out." [...] He always completed the plot before working on specific character actions. For a novel the note-writing process could take up to two years, and he would usually have two or more novels in preparation simultaneously. After he had completed his notes, he would draw up a fuller scenario of about thirty thousand words, which ensured plot holes were avoided, and allowed for the dialogue to begin to develop. When interviewed in 1975 he revealed that [...] "For a humorous novel you've got to have a scenario, and you've got to test it so that you know where the comedy comes in, where the situations come in... splitting it up into scenes (you can make a scene of almost anything) and have as little stuff in between as possible." [...] He preferred working between 4 and 7pm—but never after dinner—and would work seven days a week. In his younger years, he would write around two to three thousand words a day, although he slowed as he aged, so that in his nineties he would produce a thousand. The reduced speed in writing slowed his production of books: when younger he would produce a novel in about three months, while Bachelors Anonymous, published in 1973, took around six months.|$|E

The {{rewriting}} {{of the song}} was prompted by a letter from Gilbert to Sullivan dated 23 January 1887: [...] "I can’t help thinking that the second act would be greatly improved if the recitation before Grossmith’s song were omitted and the song re-set to an air that would admit of his singing it desperately – almost in a passion, the torrent of which would take him off the stage at the end. After a long and solemn ghost scene, I fancy a lachrymose song is quite out of place".|$|E
2500|$|With {{this new}} way of life, Bourguiba distanced from the other students, even with the Zouitens, {{supposed}} to be his future family-in-law and sightseeing in Paris. It was Habib, the brother of Chadlia Zouiten, who discovered his affair with Mathilde and wrote him a letter: [...] "I do not hide <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> this attitude a bit coward [...] you, {{who was supposed to}} marry my sister". But even in the neighbourhood, their relationship was very frowned and, to end gossips, Bourguiba elaborated a stratagem: He wore his costume and arrived in Mathilde's car, accompanied by Sfar and Guiga to simulate their wedding. All these changes seemed to have distanced him from his way of activism in Tunisia, despite the riots and uprising that started in the country, the resident-general ending up signing a decree to prohibit freedom of expression, but also censoring newspapers.|$|E
2500|$|Del Toro {{has said}} the film has strong {{connections}} in theme to The Devil's Backbone and {{should be seen as}} an informal sequel dealing with some of the issues raised there. Fernando Tielve and Íñigo Garcés, who played the protagonists of The Devil's Backbone, make cameo appearances as unnamed guerrilla soldiers in Pan's Labyrinth. Some of the other works he drew on for inspiration include Lewis Carroll's Alice books, Jorge Luis Borges' Ficciones, Arthur Machen's The Great God Pan and The White People, Lord Dunsany's The Blessing of Pan, Algernon Blackwood's Pan's Garden and Francisco Goya's works. In 2004, del Toro said: [...] "Pan is an original story. Some of my favourite writers (Borges, Blackwood, Machen, Dunsany) have explored the figure of the god Pan and the symbol of the labyrinth. These are things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> very compelling and I am trying to mix them and play with them." [...] It was also influenced by the illustrations of Arthur Rackham.|$|E

Where the party is not legal, only the mushrif knows the names of members of other cells. A candidate for membership swears an oath of loyalty (qasam)“In the name of Allah, I swear to protect Islam and to maintain fidelity to it; I swear to accept and follow goals, ideas and principles of HT in words and deeds; I swear to recognize the rightness of the party leadership’s actions; I swear to carry out even those decisions of the party leaders <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> objectionable; I swear to direct all my energies for {{the realization of the}} party program.

2500|$|There Buechner {{realized}} {{the challenge of}} writing without the structure of school life around him. He describes the creation of his next novel, The Entrance to Porlock, as follows: [...] "...the labor of writing which was so painful <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> it hard, even now, to see beyond {{the memory of the}} pain to whatever merit it may have." [...] However, in 1968, Buechner received a letter from Charles Price, the chaplain at Harvard, inviting him to give the Noble Lectures series in the winter of 1969. His predecessors in this role were none other than Richard Niebuhr and George Buttrick, and Buechner was both flattered and daunted by the idea of joining so august a group. When he voiced his concerns, Price replied that he should write [...] "something in the area of [...] "religion and letters."" [...] Thence came the idea to write about the everyday events of life [...] "as the alphabet through which God, of his grace, spells out his words, his meaning, to us. So The Alphabet of Grace was the title I hit upon, and what I set out to do was to try to describe a single representative day of my life in a way to suggest what there was of God to hear in it." [...] This process showed Buechner {{a way out of the}} frustration he had felt while writing The Entrance to Porlock: by drawing on his own experience, he found the means to convey his thoughts through his writing.|$|E
