5|$|Against the Chicago Bulls in {{the first}} round of the 2006 NBA Playoffs, Wade shook off a few {{injuries}} that scared Heat fans, including a severely bruised hip in Game 5. Returning late in the half, Wade resurrected his team by scoring 15 of his 28 points while suffering from intense pain, leading the Heat to the much-needed 3–2 series lead. After this, Wade successfully led his team to the 2006 NBA Finals, despite suffering from flu-like symptoms in game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Detroit Pistons. He put up a double-double with 14 points and 10 assists in that game, including an 8-point flurry to close out the third quarter <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> game out of reach.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland posted an 11–1 {{record in}} 1951, losing their only game to the San Francisco 49ers {{in the season}} opener. That gave the Browns another spot in the {{championship}} game, again against the Rams. This time, however, the Rams won 24–17. Graham fumbled {{the ball in the}} third quarter, setting up a touchdown <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> Rams ahead 14–10. Three of his throws were intercepted, but he put up 280yards of passing and a touchdown. After the season, Graham was named the league's Most Valuable Player.|$|E
5|$|Marshall held another {{press conference}} on October 17 to {{announce}} that the NAACP was requesting a formal government investigation into the working conditions that had led the men to strike. He called attention to three aspects: the Navy policy <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> great majority of African Americans into segregated shore duty, the unsafe munitions handling practices and lack of training that had led to the catastrophic detonationand the unfair manner in which 50 of 258 men had been singled out as mutineers. when their actions concerning loading ammunition after the explosion {{were not significantly different}} from the other 208 men. Marshall pointed to the men of Division One who had refused to load ammunition prior to August 9, but had been shipped out and given other duty, not arrested and court-martialled.|$|E

The French gained 100,000 muskets, 500 cannons, and intact bridges across the Danube.|$|E
5|$|Psilocin and {{psilocybin}} {{are scheduled}} drugs in many countries, and mushrooms containing them are prohibited by extension. In the United States, Federal {{law was passed}} in 1971 <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> psychoactive components into the most restricted schedule I category. For about three decades following this, several European countries remained relatively tolerant of mushroom use and possession. In the 2000s (decade), in response to increases in prevalence and availability, all European countries banned possession or sale of psychedelic mushrooms; the Netherlands was the last country to enact such laws in 2008. However, they did not include psilocybin-containing sclerotia in the 2008 law, and thus, psilocybin-containing fungal compounds are available commercially in the Netherlands. In parallel legal developments in Asia, P.tampanensis was one of 13 psychoactive mushrooms specifically prohibited by law in Japan in 2002.|$|E

5|$|In Alabama's {{first trip}} to Lexington since 2004, and their first road game of the 2009 season, the Tide {{defeated}} the Kentucky Wildcats 38–20. Alabama scored on their opening drive after Javier Arenas returned the opening kickoff 60 yards, which set up an 11-yard Mark Ingram touchdown for an early 7–0 lead. Kentucky responded {{with a pair of}} 49-yard Lones Seiber field goals. The score was 7–6 {{at the end of the}} first quarter. The Tide extended their lead late in the second quarter following a nearly seven-minute, 13-play, 97-yard touchdown drive. Greg McElroy passes of 27 and 21 yards and a 13-yard run by Ingram moved Bama down the field, culminating with a three-yard touchdown pass from McElroy to Colin Peek to put the Tide up 14–6. With only 40 seconds remaining in the half, Kentucky tailback Derrick Locke fumbled the ball after catching a short pass. Courtney Upshaw returned 45 yards for an Alabama touchdown <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> Tide ahead 21–6 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play of the fourth quarter, Thurman Thomas ran for a 31-yard {{touchdown}} <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> Bills back in front, 19–17. A few possessions later, the Giants drove down to the Bills 4yard line, but were unable to score and {{had to settle for}} a 21-yard field goal by Matt Bahr that gave the Giants a 20–19 lead. Both teams exchanged possessions before the Bills began one final drive. The Bills drove down to the Giants 30-yard line to set up what would be a potentially game-winning 47-yard field goal attempt by Scott Norwood. Just before the kick, ABC showed a graphic indicating that, on grass that season, Norwood had made just 3–of–7 field goals from at least 40yards. A few moments later, in what became the game's signature moment, Norwood's attempt missed wide right, and the Giants won their second Super Bowl, 20–19.|$|E

5|$|The Browns won the AAFC's Western Division {{with their}} perfect record {{and faced the}} Buffalo Bills, {{the winners of the}} Eastern Division, in the AAFC {{championship}} game. The Bills had tied with the Colts for the lead in the Eastern, forcing a playoff that the Buffalo won on December 12 in Baltimore. The championship game took place in Cleveland in 35-degree weather and was sparsely attended. The Browns were expected to win the game, having beaten the Bills twice in the regular season and possessing a significantly better record than the 7–7 Bills. The scoring began with a late-first-quarter Edgar Jones touchdown run, followed by a fumble return for a touchdown by George Young in the second period <b>that</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> Browns ahead 14–0 at halftime. Cleveland scored two more touchdowns in the third quarter on runs by Jones and Motley before Buffalo scored its first points. Aided by a roughing the kicker penalty on the Browns, the Bills capped an 80-yard drive with a short touchdown pass from Jim Still to Al Baldwin. Motley scored two more touchdowns in the fourth quarter, however, and Lou Saban ran back an interception for a third to make the final score 49–7. Motley and Edgar Jones led the Browns offense in the game, accounting for a large share of the team's offensive production. Graham had an uncharacteristically quiet day, passing for just 118 yards on 11 completions. The victory made the Browns the first professional team to win three league championships in a row, following AAFC titles they won in 1946 and 1947. It was also the first time a professional football team finished a full season unbeaten and untied since a championship game was instituted in the NFL in 1933. The Chicago Bears had finished with perfect records in 1934 and 1942, but lost the NFL championship both times. The Browns had won 18 consecutive games stretching to the 1947 season, a professional record that stood until 2004.|$|E
