5|$|The first Devonian <b>tetrapod</b> {{identified}} from Asia {{was recognized}} from a fossil jawbone reported in 2002. The Chinese <b>tetrapod</b> Sinostega pani was discovered among fossilized tropical plants and lobe-finned {{fish in the}} red sandstone sediments of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of northwest China. This finding substantially extended the geographical range of these animals and has raised new questions about the worldwide distribution and great taxonomic diversity they achieved within a relatively short time.|$|E
5|$|Estimates {{published}} {{after the}} discovery of Zachelmie tracks suggested that digited tetrapods may have appeared as early as 427.4 Ma ago and questioned attempts to read absolute timing of evolutionary events in early <b>tetrapod</b> evolution from stratigraphy.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} noted that convergency is {{considered}} responsible for uniquely <b>tetrapod</b> features found also in other non-elpistostegalian fish from the period like Sauripterus (finger-like jointed distal radial bones) or Tarrasius (tetrapod-like spine with 5 axial regions).|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between quadrupeds and <b>tetrapods</b> {{is important in}} evolutionary biology, particularly {{in the context of}} <b>tetrapods</b> whose limbs have adapted to other roles (e.g. hands in the case of humans, wings in the case of birds, and fins in the case of whales). All of these animals are <b>tetrapods,</b> but none is a quadruped. Even snakes, whose limbs have become vestigial or lost entirely, are nevertheless <b>tetrapods.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this report, the {{nitrogen}} doped ZnO <b>tetrapods</b> are prepared {{by using the}} solid reaction of ZnO <b>tetrapods</b> and urea at 600 degrees C. XRD shows that the crystal structure of nitrogen doped ZnO is unchanged maybe due to the low percentage of {{the nitrogen}} doping. SEM proves that the nitrogen doping occurs {{on the surface of}} ZnO. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity of the nitrogen doped ZnO <b>tetrapods</b> is evaluated for Bisphenol A photodegradation under visible light irradiation. The results show that the photocatalytic activity of nitrogen doped ZnO <b>tetrapods</b> is higher than those of pure ZnO <b>tetrapods</b> and Degussa TiO 2 P 25, indicating the great effect of nitrogen doping on the photocatalytic activity of nitrogen doped ZnO <b>tetrapods.</b> Finally, a mechanism is proposed to explain the photodegradation of BPA over nitrogen doped ZnO <b>tetrapods</b> photocatalyst under visible light irradiation.

40|$|Though it {{has been}} {{established}} that ZnO <b>tetrapods</b> can be synthesized by heating Zn in air, it is advantageous to grow <b>tetrapods</b> with legs of different morphologies with different lengths. Here, we report the large scale synthesis of ZnO <b>tetrapods</b> by heating Zn in air ambient. The parameters that control the diameter, length, and morphology of <b>tetrapods</b> are identified. It is shown that the morphology and dimensions of the <b>tetrapods</b> depend {{not only on the}} vaporization temperature but also on the temperature gradient of the furnace. The controlled synthesis procedure and the key parameters that influence the morphology are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Aetosaur fossil remains {{are known}} from Europe, North and South America, parts of Africa and India. Since their {{armoured}} plates are often preserved and are abundant in certain localities, aetosaurs serve as important Late Triassic <b>tetrapod</b> index fossils. Many aetosaurs had wide geographic ranges, but their stratigraphic ranges were relatively short. Therefore, {{the presence of}} particular aetosaurs can accurately date a site that they are found in.|$|E
5|$|Fish do {{not possess}} {{parathyroid}} glands; several species {{have been found to}} express parathyroid hormone. Developmental genes and calcium-sensing receptors in fish gills are similar to those within the parathyroid glands of birds and mammals. It has been suggested that the <b>tetrapod</b> glands may have been evolutionarily derived from these fish gills.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Mastodonsaurus, {{some of the}} earliest named genera included Metopias and Rhombopholis in 1842, Zygosaurus in 1848, Trematosaurus in 1849, Baphetes and Dendrerpeton in 1853, Capitosaurus in 1858, and Dasyceps in 1859. Baphetes is now placed as an early <b>tetrapod</b> outside Temnospondyli, and Rhombopholis is now considered a prolacertiform reptile.|$|E
40|$|Tetrapod-shaped CdSe(core) /CdTe(arms) {{colloidal}} nanocrystals, capped with alkylphosphonic acids or pyridine, were {{reacted with}} various small molecules (acetic acid, hydrazine and chlorosilane) which induced their tip-to-tip assembly into soluble networks. These networks were subsequently processed into films by drop casting and their photoconductive properties were studied. We observed that films prepared from <b>tetrapods</b> coated with phosphonic acids were not photoconductive, but tip-to-tip networks {{of the same}} <b>tetrapods</b> exhibited appreciable photocurrents. On the other hand, films prepared from <b>tetrapods</b> coated with pyridine instead of phosphonic acids were already highly photoconductive even if the nanocrystals were not joined tip-to-tip. Based on the current-voltage behavior under light we infer that the tunneling between <b>tetrapods</b> is the dominant charge transport mechanism. In all the samples, chemically-induced assembly into networks tended to reduce the average tunneling barrier. Additionally, pyridine-coated <b>tetrapods</b> and the tip-to-tip networks made out of them were tested as active materials in hybrid photovoltaic devices. Overall, we introduce an approach to chemically-induced tip-to-tip assembly of <b>tetrapods</b> into solution processable networks and demonstrate the enhancement of electronic coupling of <b>tetrapods</b> by various ligand exchange procedures...|$|R
50|$|Other clades {{include the}} Eotetrapodiformes (Tinirau, Platycephalichthys, the Tristichopteridae and Elpistostegalia). Older taxons that include late stem <b>tetrapods</b> and early <b>tetrapods</b> are the Labyrinthodontia and Ichthyostegalia.|$|R
50|$|Herbivory among four-limbed {{terrestrial}} vertebrates, the <b>tetrapods</b> {{developed in}} the Late Carboniferous (307 - 299 million years ago). Early <b>tetrapods</b> were large amphibious piscivores. While amphibians continued to feed on fish and insects, some reptiles began exploring two new food types, <b>tetrapods</b> (carnivory) and plants (herbivory). The entire dinosaur order ornithischia was composed with herbivores dinosaurs. Carnivory was a natural transition from insectivory for medium and large <b>tetrapods,</b> requiring minimal adaptation. In contrast, {{a complex set of}} adaptations was necessary for feeding on highly fibrous plant materials.|$|R
5|$|In tetrapods, {{the thyroid}} is always found {{somewhere in the}} neck region. In most <b>tetrapod</b> species, there are two paired thyroid glands – that is, {{the right and left}} lobes are not joined together. However, there is only ever a single thyroid gland in most mammals, and the shape found in humans is common to many other species.|$|E
5|$|The first fully {{terrestrial}} vertebrates were amniotes. Like their amphibious <b>tetrapod</b> predecessors, {{they had}} lungs and limbs. Amniotic eggs, however, have internal membranes {{that allow the}} developing embryo to breathe but keep water in. Hence, amniotes can lay eggs on dry land, while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other <b>tetrapod</b> traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of the skull and jaw that allowed them to swallow prey on land. Prey could be caught in the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E
5000|$|Diadectids {{were the}} first fully herbivorous <b>tetrapods.</b> Although several other groups of early <b>tetrapods</b> {{independently}} acquired herbivory, diadectids were the only Carboniferous <b>tetrapods</b> that were able to process high-fiber terrestrial plants. Diadectids were also the most diverse group of herbivores, representing the first radiation of plant-eating <b>tetrapods.</b> Both Cope and Marsh recognized that diadectids were herbivores in 1878 when they studied their distinctively broad, cusped teeth (in his description of Diadectes, Cope mentioned, [...] "animals belonging to this genus were, in all probability, herbivorous").|$|R
50|$|Stem <b>tetrapods</b> are {{the animals}} {{belonging}} to the lineage leading to <b>tetrapods</b> from their divergence from the lungfish, our nearest relatives among the fishes. In addition {{to a series of}} lobe-finned fishes, they also include some of the early labyrinthodonts. Exactly what labyrinthodonts are in the stem group <b>tetrapods</b> rather than the corresponding crown group is uncertain, as the phylogeny of early <b>tetrapods</b> is not well understood. This example shows that crown and stem group definitions are of limited value when there is no consensus phylogeny.|$|R
50|$|The elpistostegalians {{gave rise}} to the <b>tetrapods</b> in the Eifelian (early middle Devonian) around 395 million years ago. While the early <b>tetrapods</b> flourished and diversified over the next 30 million years, the non-tetrapod elpistostegalians {{disappear}} from the fossil record fairly quickly in the early Frasnian around 380 million years ago, leaving the <b>tetrapods</b> the sole survivors of their line.|$|R
5|$|Lambeosaurus {{was like}} other hadrosaurids, and could move on both two legs and all fours, {{as shown by}} {{footprints}} of related animals. It had a long tail stiffened by ossified tendons that prevented it from drooping. The hands had four fingers, lacking the innermost finger of the generalized five-fingered <b>tetrapod</b> hand, while the second, third, and fourth fingers were bunched together and bore hooves, suggesting the animal could have used the hands for support. The fifth finger was free and {{could be used to}} manipulate objects. Each foot had only the three central toes.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara has gastralia, rib-like bones {{also called}} gastric or {{abdominal}} ribs, the presumed ancestral trait of diapsids. They {{are found in}} some lizards, where they are mostly made of cartilage, as well as crocodiles and the tuatara, and are not attached to the spine or thoracic ribs. The true ribs are small projections, with small, hooked bones, called uncinate processes, found on the rear of each rib. This feature is also present in birds. The tuatara is the only living <b>tetrapod</b> with well-developed gastralia and uncinate processes.|$|E
5|$|Unlike semiaquatic temnospondyls, {{terrestrial}} temnospondyls have skulls {{that are}} adapted for biting land-living prey. The sutures between {{the bones of}} the skull in the dissorophoid Phonerpeton are able to withstand a high degree of compression. Compressive forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey. Earlier aquatic tetrapods and <b>tetrapod</b> ancestors differ from temnospondyls like Phonerpeton in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension. This tension would have been experienced during suction feeding underwater. Temnospondyls like Phonerpeton were among the first tetrapods that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting.|$|E
50|$|Crown <b>tetrapods</b> {{are defined}} as the nearest common {{ancestor}} of all living <b>tetrapods</b> (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) along {{with all of the}} descendants of that ancestor.|$|R
50|$|The oldest partial {{fossils of}} <b>tetrapods</b> {{date from the}} Frasnian {{beginning}} ~380 mya. These include Elginerpeton and Obruchevichthys. Some paleontologists dispute their status as true (digit-bearing) <b>tetrapods.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Stem <b>tetrapods</b> {{are members}} of Tetrapodomorpha, which unlike the Stem Tetrapoda, are a total group and thus a true clade, {{including}} stem <b>tetrapods</b> and their descendants, crown tetrapods: ...|$|R
5|$|In 1977, Polish {{paleontologist}} Teresa Maryańska {{proposed that}} the complex sinuses and nasal cavities of ankylosaurs may have lightened {{the weight of the}} skull, housed a nasal gland, or acted as a chamber for vocal resonance. Carpenter rejected these hypotheses, arguing that <b>tetrapod</b> animals make sounds through the larynx, not the nostrils, and that reduction in weight was minimal, as the spaces only accounted for a small percent of the skull volume. He also considered a gland unlikely, and noted that the sinuses may not have had any specific function. It is also been suggested that the respiratory passages were used to perform a mammal-like treatment of inhaled air, based on the presence and arrangement of specialized bones.|$|E
5|$|In biology, {{homology}} is {{the existence}} of shared ancestry between a pair of structures, or genes, in different taxa. A common example of homologous structures is the forelimbs of vertebrates, where the wings of bats, the arms of primates, the front flippers of whales and the forelegs of dogs and horses are all derived from the same ancestral <b>tetrapod</b> structure. Evolutionary biology explains homologous structures adapted to different purposes {{as the result of}} descent with modification from a common ancestor. Homology was explained by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution in 1859, but had been observed before this, from Aristotle onwards, and it was explicitly analysed by Pierre Belon in 1555. The term was applied to biology by the anatomist Richard Owen in 1843.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the evolution of the <b>tetrapod</b> limb from fins in lobe-finned fishes is related to expression of the HOXD13 gene or the loss of the proteins actinodin 1 and actinodin 2, which are involved in fish fin development. Robot simulations suggest that the necessary nervous circuitry for walking evolved from the nerves governing swimming, utilizing the sideways oscillation of the body with the limbs primarily functioning as anchoring points and providing limited thrust. This type of movement, as well as changes to the pectoral girdle are similar to those seen in the fossil record can be induced in bichirs by raising then out of water.|$|E
500|$|Temnospondyls {{are placed}} as basal <b>tetrapods</b> in phylogenetic analyses, with their exact {{positioning}} varying between studies. Depending on {{the classification of}} modern amphibians, they are either included in the crown group Tetrapoda or the stem of Tetrapoda. Crown-group <b>tetrapods</b> are descendants {{of the most recent}} common ancestor of all living <b>tetrapods</b> and stem <b>tetrapods</b> are forms that are outside the crown group. Modern amphibians have recently been suggested as descendants of temnospondyls, which would place them within crown Tetrapoda. Below is a cladogram from Ruta et al. (2003) placing Temnospondyli within crown Tetrapoda: ...|$|R
500|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>tetrapods</b> began about 400 {{million years ago}} in the Devonian Period with the earliest <b>tetrapods</b> evolved from lobe-finned fishes. <b>Tetrapods</b> are categorized as a biological superclass, Tetrapoda, which includes all living and extinct amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. [...] While most species today are terrestrial, little evidence supports the idea that any of the earliest <b>tetrapods</b> could move about on land, as their limbs could not have held their midsections off the ground and the known trackways do not indicate they dragged their bellies around. Presumably, the tracks were made by animals walking along the bottoms of shallow bodies of water. The specific aquatic ancestors of the <b>tetrapods,</b> and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.|$|R
50|$|Amniote <b>tetrapods</b> drove most {{amphibian}} <b>tetrapods</b> {{to extinction}} {{as they began}} to dominate. One group of amniotes diverged into the reptiles, which includes lepidosaurs, dinosaurs (which includes birds), crocodilians, turtles, and extinct relatives; while another group of amniotes diverged into the mammals and their extinct relatives. The amniotes include the <b>tetrapods</b> that further evolved for flight—such as birds from among the dinosaurs, and bats from among the mammals.|$|R
5|$|One aetosaur, Typothorax coccinarum, {{has been}} used to define the Revueltian land {{vertebrate}} faunachron. A land vertebrate faunachron (LVF) is a time interval that is defined by the first appearance datum (FAD), or first occurrence, of a <b>tetrapod</b> index fossil and is commonly used to date Late Triassic and Early Jurassic terrestrial strata. Since the FAD of T. coccinarum is {{at the beginning of the}} Norian stage, the Revueltian LVF starts at the beginning of the Norian around 216 million years ago. The Revueltian ends with the next FAD, which happens to be that of the phytosaur Redondasaurus and the start of the Apachean LVF.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls {{and other}} early {{tetrapods}} have rounded otic notches {{in the back}} of the skull that project into the cheek region. In life, the otic notch would have been covered by a membrane called the tympanum, which is seen as a disk-like area in living frogs. The tympanum is involved in hearing, and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced tetrapods. It was traditionally thought that the tympanum developed very early in <b>tetrapod</b> evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum of amniotes. Thus, temnospondyls possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{nostrils}} in most bony fish {{differ from}} those of tetrapods. Normally, bony fish have four nares (nasal openings), one naris behind the other on each side. As the fish swims, water flows into the forward pair, across the olfactory tissue, and out through the posterior openings. This is true not only of ray-finned fish but also of the coelacanth, a fish included in the Sarcopterygii, the group that also includes the tetrapods. In contrast, the tetrapods have only one pair of nares externally but also sport a pair of internal nares, called choanae, allowing them to draw air through the nose. Lungfish are also sarcopterygians with internal nostrils, but these are sufficiently different from <b>tetrapod</b> choanae that they have long been recognized as an independent development.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>tetrapods</b> inhabited saltwater, brackish-water, and freshwater environments, {{as well as}} environments {{of highly}} variable salinity. These traits were shared with many early lobed-finned fishes. As early <b>tetrapods</b> are found on two Devonian continents, Laurussia (Euramerica) and Gondwana, {{as well as the}} island of North China, it is widely supposed that early <b>tetrapods</b> were capable of swimming across the shallow (and relatively narrow) continental-shelf seas that separated these landmasses.|$|R
50|$|Tulerpeton is {{important}} in the study of dactyly. The polydactyl (more than 5 toes) condition of Tulerpeton caused considerable comment when the fossil was first discovered. Before the discovery, the pentyldactyl, the 5-fingered condition that is ancestral to all living <b>tetrapods,</b> was thought to have developed before the first terrestrial <b>tetrapods</b> appeared. But the discoveries of Acanthostega and Ichthyostega confirm that the pentyldactyl ancestor came later in the development of <b>tetrapods.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because {{the only}} {{specimen}} of Antlerpeton is incomplete and lacks a skull, its {{relationships with other}} early <b>tetrapods</b> are poorly understood. The compound vertebrae of Antlerpeton distinguish it from lepospondyls and ally it with more primitive stem <b>tetrapods.</b> Antlerpeton shows characteristics of both early rhachitomous <b>tetrapods</b> and later schizomerous <b>tetrapods.</b> Rhachitomous <b>tetrapods</b> have two types of bones in each vertebral segment: the pleurocentrum and the intercentrum. The intercentrum is {{the larger of the}} two bones in rhachitomes, while the pleurocentra are present as two smaller bones in a dorsal position between the intercentra. Schizomerous <b>tetrapods</b> differ from rhachitomes in that their pleurocentra have descended to a more ventral position in the vertebral column. The pleurocentra enlarged in reptiliomorphs to become the main element of the vertebral centrum. While the compound vertebrae of Antlerpeton {{are similar to those of}} classic rhachitomes, the pleurocentra form a distinctive connection with the intercentra in front of and behind them. This pattern is called the anteropleural condition because the paired pleurocentra are associated with the anterior face of the intercentrum behind them. The anteropleural condition is seen in other forms like Whatcheeria, which are generally considered to be advanced rhachitomes. However, it is also seen in lobe-finned fish like Lohsania, suggesting that the feature is not unique to derived early <b>tetrapods.</b>|$|R
