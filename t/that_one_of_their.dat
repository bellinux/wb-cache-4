5|$|By {{the time}} they were ready for their first {{practical}} installation, they heard <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> members, Girja Sharan, had obtained a grant to construct a dew condenser in Kothara, India. In April 2001, Sharan had incidentally noticed substantial condensation on the roof of a cottage at Toran Beach Resort in the arid coastal region of Kutch, where he was briefly staying. The following year, he investigated the phenomenon more closely and interviewed local people. Financed by the Gujarat Energy Development Agency and the World Bank, Sharan and his team went on to develop passive, radiative condensers for use in the arid coastal region of Kutch. Active commercialisation began in 2006.|$|E

5|$|The line-ups {{selected}} for the 16 February match were both strong, and close to full strength. Though 12 of the England side had not played internationally before, all were experienced at domestic level. The match was refereed by Rowland Hill, who had also officiated the Natives' first match in Britain, against Surrey. The opening {{of the first half}} was a scoreless affair, with much tackling and scrummaging on the heavy ground. Later in the half England scored two tries through Harry Bedford, but both were disputed by the Natives, who claimed <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> players had grounded the ball in-goal. England took the two-try advantage into the second half.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, after {{a number}} of Viet Cong units mistakenly began the planned {{offensive}} against South Vietnam a day early—attacking several towns in I and II Corps on the morning of 30 January—the President of the Republic of Vietnam, Nguyen Van Thieu, subsequently cancelled the ceasefire. Regardless, the offensive proper began {{in the early hours of}} 31 January when 85,000 to 100,000 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops simultaneously assaulted population centres and allied installations across South Vietnam. US and South Vietnamese intelligence reports of the impending attacks had afforded some forewarning, and although failures had caught some allied units unprepared, they did not come as a complete surprise. Indeed, the growing threat had earlier prompted Lieutenant General Frederick Weyand, commander of III Corps Tactical Zone, to request the use of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)—now at full strength with three infantry battalions and support arms—outside of their usual base in Phuoc Tuy Province in order to defend the vital bases in the Long Binh–Bien Hoa complex north-east of Saigon. The request was subsequently approved, although the Australians only agreed on the basis <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> battalions—3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR)—would remain at Nui Dat to secure it in case of attack.|$|E
5|$|The Burnley {{board had}} planned {{a tour of}} Spain to take place {{during the summer of}} 1921 after the {{culmination}} of the league campaign. However, the trip had to be cancelled when the club received notice from the Spanish Football Federation <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> intended opponents, Barcelona, had been suspended from all matches. Further tours of Norway and France were then arranged, but these also had to be abandoned after the Football Association refused to grant permission. At {{the end of the season}} five players were given free transfers by the club; Len Smelt and Frank Birchenough, who had both played for Burnley during the campaign, and three reserve players. Moreover, two players–Bert Freeman and George Thompson–were placed on the transfer list by the manager.|$|E

X's (Steven Williams) role as an informant is discovered, and he is shot dead, although he is able to pass along the name of another informant who can be of use to Mulder—Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), the Special Representative to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Covarrubias' aid is sought when Mulder attempts to reach Tunguska in Russia to investigate the source of a further black oil contamination. Whilst there, Mulder is held in a gulag and used as a successful test subject for a black oil vaccine. He escapes and is able to return to America, having found that Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) is working with the Russians.|$|E

30|$|There are {{a number}} of rules for {{modelling}} opinion formation in complex networks. For example, considering discrete opinions, in the voter model, randomly selected agents exchange <b>their</b> opinions by <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> neighbours (Krapivsky & Redner 2003). The agents might influence their neighbouring agents to change their opinions based on their strength and the neighbours’ threshold (Leskovec et al. 2006). In the evolution of continuous opinions on a network, the opinions of two connected agents are updated if their difference is less than a threshold, i.e. the agents have evolving opinions (Deffuant et al. 2001; Amblard & Deffuant 2004; Lorenz 2007; Kurmyshev et al. 2011; Hegselmann & Krause 2002; Guo & Cai 2009).|$|R

Introducing fighting brands can be an attractive strategy because they help fight off a price-cutting brand that is threatening the core brand of the company while conserving its important image and profitability.|$|R

Fifteen years later, in April2001, a team of Swedish police officers went to interview PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan in a Turkish prison about Turkish allegations that a dissident Kurdish group, led by Öcalan's ex-wife, murdered Palme. The police team's visit proved futile.|$|E
50|$|Interestingly, unlike {{almost all}} {{other forms of}} racing that feature routine pit stops, Formula One rules limit teams to a single pit crew for the {{mandatory}} two cars entered.

50|$|Positive {{consequences}} of hindsight bias {{is an increase}} in one’s confidence and performance, as long as the bias distortion is reasonable and does not create overconfidence.

25|$|A more {{authentic}} tradition represents Lysias as having spoken his own Olympiacus at the Olympic festival of 388 BC, to which Dionysius I of Syracuse {{had sent a}} magnificent embassy.

Lysias lifted up his voice to denounce Dionysius as, next to Artaxerxes, the worst enemy of Hellas, and to impress upon the assembled Greeks <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> foremost duties was to deliver Sicily from a hateful oppression. The latest work of Lysias which we can date (a fragment of a speech For Pherenicus) belongs to 381 or 380 BC. He probably died in or soon after 380 BC.|$|E
