40|$|This paper investigates {{property}} tax systems (linear taxes on pre-development land value, post-development structure value, and post-development site value) from a partial equilibrium perspective. Particular {{attention is paid}} to characterizing {{property tax}} systems that are neutral with respect to the timing and density of development and to calculating the deadweight loss from non-neutral property tax systems. property taxation, site value taxation, land <b>taxation,</b> <b>neutrality...</b>|$|E
40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{characteristics}} of a S-based tax system under default risk. In particular we show that its neutrality properties depend on whether debt is protected or unprotected. In the former case, this system is neutral. In the latter case, where default timing is optimally chosen by shareholders, the S-based system is neutral with respect to real decisions only if the firm’s and the lender’s tax rate are equal. However, the shareholders’ decision to default is always distorted. capital structure, corporate <b>taxation,</b> <b>neutrality,</b> option pricing...|$|E
40|$|Much {{is riding}} on the second Irish {{referendum}} on the Lisbon Treaty, due in September 2009. Twenty-five European Union countries have ratified the treaty to reform the EU's institutional and decision-making machinery; the European Council has reassured Ireland that the treaty will not interfere with Irish <b>taxation</b> or <b>neutrality.</b> However, other members are watching the second Irish outcome carefully...|$|R
50|$|First {{plans for}} a revote {{appeared}} in July 2008: the term of the current European Commission would be extended until the Lisbon Treaty comes into force, member states would agree not {{to reduce the number}} of Commissioners and Ireland would hold another vote in September or October 2009 after receiving guarantees on abortion, <b>taxation</b> and military <b>neutrality.</b> On 12 December 2008 the Taoiseach, Brian Cowen confirmed that a second referendum would be held, after an EU leaders summit agreed to keep 1 Commissioner per member state and to incorporate legally binding guarantees on abortion, <b>taxation</b> and military <b>neutrality</b> in the Croatian Accession Treaty.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Ricardo {{experienced}} Pitt’s income tax policies, and that he regarded taxation {{as the most important}} issue to which the principles of political economy should be applied, he rarely referred to actual tax reforms. This paper indicates that Ricardo’s system of economics cannot bring about any tax that is completely compatible with his main criteria for <b>taxation</b> (distribution <b>neutrality,</b> price <b>neutrality</b> and minimum <b>taxation)</b> as well as certainty, convenience and the security of property. This result may explain why Ricardo did not say which type of taxation system the British government should establish...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the implications of}} optimal tax theory for the debates on uniform commodity taxation and neutral capital income taxation. While strong administrative and political economy {{arguments in favor of}} uniform and neutral taxation remain, recent advances in optimal tax theory suggest that the information needed to implement the differentiated taxation prescribed by optimal tax theory may be easier to obtain than previously believed. The paper also points to the strong similarity between optimal commodity tax rules and the rules for optimal source-based capital income taxation.

40|$|A Norwegian {{tax reform}} {{committee}} recently proposed a personal {{tax on the}} realized income from shares after deduction for an imputed risk-free rate of return. This paper describes {{the design of the}} proposed shareholder income tax and shows that it will be approximately neutral in several important dimensions, provided that full loss o. sets are granted. Thus the tax allows some non-distortionary double taxation of corporate equity income. With an appropriate choice of tax rates, it also solves the problem of income shifting under a dual income tax. The final part of the paper clarifies the differences between the shareholder income tax and previous proposals for neutral capital income <b>taxation.</b> tax <b>neutrality,</b> shareholder income tax, corporate-personal tax integration...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} and interactions among measures to effect saving and investment incentives ("S-I incentives") {{in the context of}} an income tax system that is inadequately indexed for inflation. Examples are proposals for more rapid depreciation of buildings and equipment and proposals to exempt larger amounts of interest income. SI incentives are classified into "consumption tax" and "direct grant" types, and it is shown that these differ in their influence on portfolio choices, in their sensitivity to inflation and in the design problems they present. Stress is placed on requirements for neutrality with respect to asset durability and portfolio composition. A new result is the derivation of the reduction in interest <b>taxation</b> yielding <b>neutrality</b> in the presence of partial expensing of real investment or equivalent investment incentive. ...|$|R
50|$|In the Irish {{referendum}} on the Lisbon Treaty many issues {{not directly related to}} the treaty, such as abortion were included in the debate because of worries that the Lisbon Treaty will enable the European Court of Justice to make activist rulings in these areas.After the rejection of the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland, the Irish Government received concessions {{from the rest of the}} member states of the European Union to make written guarantees that the EU will under no circumstances interfere with Irish abortion, <b>taxation</b> or military <b>neutrality.</b> Ireland voted on the Lisbon Treaty a second time in 2009, with a 67.13% majority voting Yes to the treaty.|$|R
40|$|The {{social costs}} of rent seeking are {{generally}} evaluated with respect to rent dissipation. A common assumption is complete rent dissipation so {{that the value of}} a contested rent is the value of social loss. When rent seekers earn taxable income, there is interdependence between the social cost of rent seeking through rent dissipation and the excess burden of taxation. Through the addition of substitution to rent seeking beyond leisure, rent seeking increases the excess burden of <b>taxation</b> under risk <b>neutrality</b> when leisure is non-inferior. We derive a condition for rent seeking to increase the excess burden of taxation under risk aversion. Our conclusion is that, when rent seekers can earn taxable income, rent seeking is more socially costly than is inferred from contest models alone, because of an increased excess burden of taxation...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{considers}} {{two types}} of models of interaction between a tax authority {{and a group of}} taxpayers. The first type of model assumes no corruption, and the strategy of the authority is the probability of auditing a taxpayer depending on his/her declared income and other available information. The purpose is to maximise the net tax revenue. The authors determine the optimal strategies for proportional and progressive <b>taxation,</b> assuming risk <b>neutrality</b> amongst taxpayers. The second type of model permits the bribing of an auditor by a taxpayer. The authors determine the optimal probabilities of audit and review by the tax authority and then study the comparative statics of net revenue with respect to the tax rate and penalties for poor auditing.

40|$|The dual {{income tax}} {{combines}} a progressive tax schedule for labor income {{with a low}} flat tax rate on capital income and corporate income. This paper restates {{the case for the}} dual income tax and discusses alternative methods of taxing business income under such a tax system, paying special attention to the taxation of income from closely held corporations. It is argued that the imputed normal return to shares in unlisted companies should be taxed as capital income, while above-normal returns should be subject to the labor-income tax. The paper demonstrates that such a tax scheme can be designed to be neutral towards the firm's investment and financing decisions and towards the decisions of shareholders to realize their shares. dual income tax, tax <b>neutrality,</b> <b>taxation</b> of business income, shareholder income tax...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{incentives}} such {{as environmental}} taxes can create attractive markets for environmentally sound products and process technologies. Many European countries {{have a long}} tradition with environmental taxes but recent figures indicate that the share of green tax revenues in the EU- 15 GDP is slightly declining. This is surprising since several governments had declared they would gradually shift the fiscal burden from labour to pollution. This paper tries to explain the fiscal inertia by analysing {{the role of the}} <b>taxation</b> base, fiscal <b>neutrality,</b> government failure with respect to the use of economic instruments and the dependence of government budgets on consumption-driven economic growth. We conclude that the initial focus on the double dividend hypothesis has strongly limited the impact of green taxes. A green tax reform based on consumption taxes that are differentiated according to the environmental impact of products could be more effective and efficient.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} effects of land value {{taxation}} and land value capture methods. Land value capture methods can be divided into three categories which are betterment tax, accessibility increment contribution and joint development. Theory of land value <b>taxation,</b> discussion about <b>neutrality</b> and challenges with the use of land value taxation are introduced. Value capture methods and their impacts according to prior research are examined. Finally the incidence of both land value taxation in general and land value capture methods is studied. Studies from different parts of the world are introduced and patterns in terms of effectivity are identified. By comparing models which estimate the incidence of land value taxation the conclusion can be made that introduction of a land value tax have different effects depending on which kind of factors and sectors are included in the model and if they are mobile or immobile. The factors which influence a value capture mechanism's ability to succeed are found to be increment of accessibility, rate of overall growth in the area, availability of developable land and zoning incentives and constraints. In the use of land value taxation and land value capture the overall characteristics of the area have a significant impact on the results and they should be considered when making policy decisions...|$|R
