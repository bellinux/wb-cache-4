5|$|In 1980, Microsoft {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with IBM to bundle Microsoft's operating system with IBM computers, paying Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1985, IBM requested that Microsoft write a new operating system for <b>their</b> <b>computers</b> called OS/2. Microsoft wrote the operating system, but also continued to sell their own alternative, which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched several versions of Microsoft Windows in the 1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world's personal computers.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, the WannaCry {{ransomware}} attack {{spread through}} the Internet, using an exploit vector named EternalBlue, which was leaked from the U.S. National Security Agency. The ransomware attack, unprecedented in scale, infected more than 230,000 computers in over 150 countries, using 20 different languages to demand money from users using Bitcoin cryptocurrency. WannaCrypt demanded US$300 per computer. The attack affected Telefónica and several other large companies in Spain, as well as parts of the British National Health Service (NHS), where at least 16 hospitals had to turn away patients or cancel scheduled operations, FedEx, Deutsche Bahn, Honda, Renault, {{as well as the}} Russian Interior Ministry and Russian telecom MegaFon. The attackers gave their victims a 7-day deadline from the day <b>their</b> <b>computers</b> got infected, after which the encrypted files would be deleted.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} and widespread {{availability of the}} Internet further changed the way pornography was distributed. Previously videos would be rented or purchased through mail-order, but with the Internet people could watch pornographic movies on <b>their</b> <b>computers,</b> and instead of waiting weeks for an order to arrive, a movie could be downloaded within minutes (or, later, within a few seconds).|$|E

50|$|Imagine a busy {{business}} office having 100 {{desktop computers}} that send emails {{to each other}} using synchronous message passing exclusively. Because the office system does not use asynchronous message passing, one worker turning off <b>their</b> <b>computer</b> can cause the other 99 computers to freeze until the worker turns <b>their</b> <b>computer</b> back on to process a single email.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{preliminary}} study that introduced a first-year general studies seminar designed to encourage interested women to rise above the obstacles to a computing major. The literature informed the design of the course’s structure and content. The literature suggests that women need a more realistic perception of computing as an area of study and work. Women need more experience to develop their interest in computing and to enhance <b>their</b> <b>computer</b> skill confidence. Women would benefit from a collaborative learning environment. While the students in this course did not change, significantly, <b>their</b> <b>computer</b> attitudes, they improved their perceptions of <b>their</b> <b>computer</b> skil...|$|R

Some of the information gained has been passed on to British politicians.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of the raid, a force of 59 police entered the {{building}} opposite the Diaz Pertini, where Covell and others had been running their Indymedia centre and where, crucially, a group of lawyers had been based, gathering evidence about police attacks on the earlier demonstrations.

25|$|On November 21, 2005, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott sued Sony BMG. Texas was {{the first}} state in the United States to bring legal action against Sony BMG in {{response}} to the rootkit. The suit was also the first filed under the state’s 2005 spyware law. It alleged that the company surreptitiously installed the spyware on millions of compact music discs (CDs) that consumers inserted into <b>their</b> <b>computers</b> when they play the CDs, which can compromise the systems.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{inactivity}} is {{a predictor}} of CVD events and related mortality.

Compared with individuals who watched television or videos or used <b>their</b> <b>computers</b> for less than one hour daily, those who carried out these behaviors for greater than four hours daily have a twofold increased risk of metabolic syndrome.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{significant}} uncertainties surrounded the RISC concept, {{and it was}} uncertain if it could have a commercial future, but by the mid-1980s the concepts had matured enough {{to be seen as}} commercially viable. In 1986 Hewlett Packard started using an early implementation of their PA-RISC in some of <b>their</b> <b>computers.</b> In the meantime, the Berkeley RISC effort had become so well known that it eventually became the name for the entire concept and in 1987 Sun Microsystems began shipping systems with the SPARC processor, directly based on the Berkeley RISC-II system.|$|E
25|$|Some {{antivirus}} vendors maintain websites {{with free}} online scanning {{capability of the}} entire computer, critical areas only, local disks, folders or files. Periodic online scanning {{is a good idea}} for those that run antivirus applications on <b>their</b> <b>computers</b> because those applications are frequently slow to catch threats. One of the first things that malicious software does in an attack is disable any existing antivirus software and sometimes the only way to know of an attack is by turning to an online resource that is not installed on the infected computer.|$|E
25|$|Realizing that {{increasing}} numbers of passengers have become reliant on <b>their</b> <b>computers</b> to stay in touch, Boeing introduced Connexion by Boeing, a satellite based Internet connectivity service that promised air travelers unprecedented access to the World Wide Web. The company debuted the product to journalists in 2005, receiving generally favorable reviews. However, facing competition from cheaper options, such as cellular networks, it proved too difficult to sell to most airlines. In August 2006, after a short and unsuccessful search for a buyer for the business, Boeing chose to discontinue the service.|$|E

25|$|While {{many homes}} have word {{processors}} on <b>their</b> <b>computers,</b> word processing {{in the home}} tends to be educational, planning or business related, dealing with school assignments or work being completed at home. Occasionally word processors are used for recreational purposes, e.g. writing short stories, poems or personal correspondence. Some use word processors to create résumés and greeting cards, {{but many of these}} home publishing processes have been taken over by web apps or desktop publishing programs specifically oriented toward home uses. The rise of email and social networks has also reduced the home role of the word processor as uses that formerly required printed output can now be done entirely online.|$|E
25|$|At a {{professional}} level, it {{is a common}} sight for companies to have <b>their</b> <b>computers</b> and laptops hooked up onto the Internet (via wired and wireless Internet connection), and for employees to have individual e-mail accounts. This greatly facilitates internal (among staffs of the company) and external (with other parties outside of one’s organization) communication. Mobile communications such as smart phones are increasingly making their way into the corporate world. For instance, in 2008, Apple announced their intention to actively step up their efforts to help companies incorporate the iPhone into their enterprise environment, facilitated by technological developments in streamlining integrated features (push e-mail, calendar and contact management) using ActiveSync.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} quite {{common in the}} 1980s to use {{physical}} floppy disks and the postal service for spreading software, in an activity known as mail trading. Prior to the sale of software that came on CD-ROM discs and after hard drives had become available, the software did not require the floppy disc {{to be in the}} drive when starting and using the program. So, a user could install it onto his/her computer and mail the disk to the next person, who could do the same. Particularly widespread in continental Europe, mail trading was even used by many of the leading cracker groups as their primary channel of interaction. Software copyright violation via mail trading was also the most common means for many computer hobbyists in the Eastern bloc countries to receive new Western software for <b>their</b> <b>computers.</b>|$|E
