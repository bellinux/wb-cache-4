5|$|Madison {{argued that}} a state, after declaring a federal law unconstitutional, could take action by {{communicating}} with other states, attempting to enlist their support, petitioning Congress to repeal the law in question, introducing amendments to the Constitution in Congress, or calling a constitutional convention. Madison did not assert that the states could legally nullify an objectionable federal law or that they could declare it void and unenforceable. By eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion, Madison <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> clear that the Democratic-Republicans were not moving toward disunion.|$|E

5|$|While Shay was {{managing}} at Kansas City in early 1910, American Association president Thomas Chivington imposed new conduct {{rules for the}} league.

After Shay was ejected from three games in a four-game span, a Minnesota newspaper article questioned whether his behavior {{would be subject to}} additional disciplinary action. The next month, Shay released 48-year-old Jake Beckley, prompting his retirement after one of the longest careers in professional baseball history.

5|$|After fierce hand-to-hand combat, {{most of the}} Muslims {{managed to}} {{withdraw}} and regroup higher up {{on the slopes of}} Uhud. A small faction was cut off and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> its way back to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend the slopes of Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims, and so the fighting ceased. Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses, cutting off their ears and noses and making the relics into anklets. Hind is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat. Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with Muhammad's companion, Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab), decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage.|$|E

When Gems turned in his first draft in 1994, Warner Bros. commissioned rewrites from Gems, Burton, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski {{in an attempt to}} lower the budget to $60 million. The final production budget came to $80 million, while Warner Bros. spent another $20 million on the Mars Attacks! marketing campaign. Filming took place from February to November 1996. The film was shot in California, Nevada, Kansas, Arizona and Argentina. The soundtrack became famous for the Martians' quirky speech pattern, which was created by reversing the sound of a duck's quack.|$|E

5|$|By September 1944, Ostojić {{had been}} {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel, and was the Chetnik area commander in eastern Bosnia.

After 12 September 1944, when King Peter called for all in Yugoslavia to rally around Tito, he and Baćović warned Mihailović that their men were losing their will to fight the Partisans.

The two {{secretaries}} often clashed with Mary Lincoln, who resorted to various stratagems to get the dilapidated White House restored without depleting Lincoln's salary, which had to cover entertainment and other expenses.
