5|$|Their {{first house}} burned, {{and the family}} lost its possessions. They {{moved to a new}} house {{on the other side of}} town on Rose Street, which Williams' mother soon turned into a {{boarding}} house. The house had a small garden, on which they grew diverse crops that Williams and his sister Irene sold around Georgiana. At a chance meeting in Georgiana, Hank Williams met U.S. Representative J. Lister Hill while he was campaigning across Alabama. Williams told Hill that his mother was interested <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> about his problems and her need to collect Elonzo Williams' disability pension. With Hill's help, the family began collecting the money. Despite his medical condition, the family managed fairly well financially throughout the Great Depression.|$|E
25|$|Superintendent Shelly officially {{took over}} at 9 am, {{but had been}} back on the scene at 8.20 am. Throughout the morning, {{numerous}} tactics were employed by the Gardaí to end the siege.

25|$|Steiner {{called the}} Egyptian pilot {{on the radio}} telling him that his plane was now {{in the custody of}} US Military. The pilot {{informed}} Steiner that an Egyptian ambassador was aboard and wanted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> A ladder was lowered from the forward door and the pilot, Captain Amed Moneeb, descended followed by Egyptian diplomat Zeid Imad Hamed. SEAL Team commander Bob Gormly met them and examined Hamed's credentials – finding them in order he escorted Hamed into the base and let him phone Egypt's foreign minister.|$|E
500|$|In a B plot, April (Aubrey Plaza) asks Andy (Chris Pratt) {{what to get}} her gay boyfriend for Christmas. [...] All of Andy's {{ideas are}} well-meaning but dumb, {{although}} it seems that April is just happy <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> To thank Andy, she gets him a Reggie Wayne jersey for Christmas. Meanwhile, Mark (Paul Schneider) tells Tom (Aziz Ansari) {{that he intends to}} get Ann a new computer bag for Christmas, but Tom tells him that he should get diamonds. In the end, he gives her the computer bag after all while Ann gives him Pacers tickets. He then gives her a second gift, telling her she does not {{have to go to the}} game, to which Ann happily accepts.|$|E
500|$|Fox Mulder and Dana Scully {{arrive in}} Connerville, where Hammond {{is the latest}} of five men who have died due to lightning-related causes. Upon visiting the arcade, Scully talks to Bart [...] "Zero" [...] Liquori, the arcade owner (and a friend of Oswald's) who {{happened}} to be present the night Hammond died. Mulder finds Oswald's high scores on the game's display, realizing that he was playing on the night Hammond died; Oswald {{was the first of the}} victims, and the only one to have survived. Elsewhere, Oswald is at work at an automobile repair shop when his boss's wife, Sharon Kiveat, walks in. He then tries talking to her, but she nervously rebuffs him; it is revealed that he had hit on her the day before, and she turned him down. His boss returns and tells Oswald that Mulder and Scully want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> When the agents visit Oswald to question him, he claims to have not witnessed anything. However, Mulder's cell phone mysteriously overheats in Oswald's presence, to which Oswald acts unsurprised.|$|E

500|$|Many {{accounts}} concerning Eystein {{in later}} sagas {{are characterized by}} literary motifs, and have little value as sources on his life. Snorri Sturluson, the Icelandic author of the early 13th century Heimskringla mastered this literary style particularly well, stylistically and psychologically. His stories includes a so-called mannjevning (literally [...] "comparison of men") between Eystein and Sigurd, {{in which the two}} boast about their skills and deeds in an attempt to outdo each other. In a similar fashion, Snorri also tells a story about how Eystein managed to cure the melancholy of a friend, by agreeing to regularly clear time <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> about what troubled him. On his physical appearance, Snorri wrote that Eystein [...] "was the handsomest man that could be seen. He had blue open eyes; his hair yellow and curling; his stature not tall, but of the middle size." [...] More reliable information, particularly about Eystein's building-projects, is offered in earlier sagas such as the work of Theodoric the Monk, a Norwegian chronicler who wrote in the late 12th century.|$|E
500|$|Frank Sinatra began {{performing}} at Caesars Palace in 1967, after a fallout with Howard Hughes and Carl Cohen at The Sands. He signed a three-year contract. In {{the early morning}} hours of September 6, 1970, Sinatra was playing a high stakes baccarat at the casino, where he was {{performing at}} the time. Normal limits for the game are US$2,000 per hand; Sinatra had been playing for US$8,000 and wanted the stakes to be raised to US$16,000. When Sinatra began shouting after his request was denied, hotel executive Sanford Waterman came <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Witnesses to the incident said the two men both made threats, with Waterman producing a gun and pointing it at Sinatra. Sinatra walked out of the casino and returned to his Palm Springs home without fulfilling the rest of his three-week engagement there. Waterman was booked on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon, but was released without bail. The local district attorney's office declined to file charges against Waterman for pulling the gun, stating that Sinatra had refused to make a statement regarding the incident. Despite swearing to never perform at Caesars again, ...|$|E
500|$|Xhinovci {{has come}} to believe that he is Hitler reincarnated since he began {{dressing}} as the Nazi leader. He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him, including Nazi-era Reichsmarks, swastika-emblazoned buttons, scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery, as well as a copy of Mein Kampf. He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word [...] "Hitler" [...] printed in bold. Locals and peacekeepers alike do not seem to mind Xhinovci's Hitler impersonations, especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought. On the contrary, many passersby—including some NATO peacekeepers—stop and greet him with the Nazi salute. One local told Vice News: [...] "I have {{a lot of other things}} to worry about in my life. I might look at him if he walks by, but that's it." [...] Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living [...] "shows great enterprise". [...] "People respect me," [...] Xhinovci explains. [...] "The young and old [...] men, women and children. Everyone greets me with [...] "Heil Hitler". Xhinovci's five daughters, referred to locally as [...] "Hitler's children", are not bothered by their father's Hitler impersonations. Xhinovci reportedly attends parent-teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance. He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and take pictures. [...] "Girls like to touch my face. They think it's a mask. They pull my hair and ask if they can kiss me on the face. When I'm out of the house with my family, people stop to talk to me. But my wife is not a jealous person—she doesn't mind." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{could not}} help laughing, but he was sorry, and would have taken her hand; she kept it from him, and removed to the {{farthest}} corner of the sofa.

2500|$|The {{poet and}} essayist Alexei Tsvetkov remembered him with these words:...he had very few {{friends in the}} {{commonly}} accepted {{sense of the word}} – that is, people who could climb into each other's skin. He {{was one of those people}} who protect their own territory very well. Yet at the same time, as strange as it might seem, it was easier <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> than with many in this traditional [...] "subcutaneous" [...] category.|$|E
2500|$|To {{make the}} walk {{accessible}} to viewers worldwide, {{it was held}} after dark, with the first step coming at 10:16p.m. local time (02:16 June 16 UTC). [...] The time was also advantageous to Wallenda, as half {{of the volume of}} water going over the Falls is diverted for power generation purposes after dusk. Wallenda wore a microphone for the event which allowed Troffer <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> while the public listened in, throughout the walk.|$|E

[...] Hakim and the other men lament the unfairness of the situation ("It's a Scandal! It's a Outrage!"). [...] Curly discovers that Laurey {{is going to the}} box social with Jud and tries to convince her to go with him instead. [...] Afraid to tell Jud she won't go with him, Laurey tries to convince Curly (and herself) that she does not love him ("People Will Say We're in Love"). [...] Hurt by her refusal, Curly goes to the smokehouse where Jud lives <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> [...] Curly suggests that since Jud does not feel appreciated, he could hang himself, and everyone would realize how much they care about him ("Pore Jud Is Daid"). [...] Their talk turns into an ominous confrontation about Laurey. After Curly leaves, Jud's resolve to win Laurey becomes even stronger, and he vows to make her his bride ("Lonely Room").|$|E
2500|$|Wilson is infamously {{difficult}} to interview, rarely ever giving a long answer. According to Salon writer Peter Gilstrap: [...] "He’s also {{been known to}} get up, extend a hand and blurt out 'Thanks!' well before the allotted time is up. And sometimes he just gets tired and shuts down. None of this, however, {{is due to a}} bad attitude." [...] He admits to having a poor memory, and in interviews, occasionally lies to [...] "test" [...] people. David Oppenheim, who interviewed Wilson in 1966, remembers that [...] "we tried <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> but didn't get much out of him. Some guy said 'He's not verbal.' He was odd and he seemed odder." [...] In 2017, the Charlotte Observers Theodon Janes surmised that while Wilson's past struggles with mental illness are widely documented, he still [...] "is faring well enough to write a book ... and to headline [...] hugely ambitious concert tour, so presumably he’s capable of telling people who work for him that he's not up for interviews, if he isn't." [...] When asked about negative comments written in the book, Love responded: [...] "He’s not in charge of his life, like I am mine. His every move is orchestrated and a lot of things he's purported to say, there’s not tape of it. But, I don’t like to put undue pressure on him, either, because I know {{he has a lot of}} issues. Out of compassion, I don't respond to everything that is purportedly said by him." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus {{they walked}} along {{down the steep}} path, until they began to enter the bushes.

50|$|Lindgren became {{interested}} in higher education administration after he started working {{in the office of}} UF President Robert Marston. Marston was a mentor to Lindgren in that regard, and was very open <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and sharing what he was doing and what was happening. In 1980, while Lindgren was still in law school, the director of University development, Bill Stone, asked Lindgren to organize a fundraising campaign of $1,500,000 for the building of another Levin School of Law building. Marshall Criser, the new president of the University, decided to replace Bill Stone with Lindgren as the Vice President for Development and Alumni Relations when Bill Stone left. With just {{four and a half years}} of experience, Lindgren was given the opportunity to head a prominent fundraising program at a major public university - a decision that with any other set of circumstances would not have made him the chief development officer at a major university, at his age and that point in time.|$|R
