500|$|The Honoured Dead Memorial, a {{sandstone}} edifice {{commissioned by}} Cecil Rhodes and designed by Sir Herbert Baker, was erected {{to commemorate the}} defenders who fell during the Siege. Twenty-seven soldiers are entombed in the memorial, which was made from stone quarried in the Matopo Hills in Zimbabwe. [...] It bears an inscription by Rudyard Kipling: [...] "This for a charge to our children in sign of <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>we</b> paid, The price that we paid for freedom that comes unsoiled to your hand; Read, revere and uncover, here are the victors laid, They who died for their City, being sons of the land". Long Cecil, the gun manufactured in the De Beers workshops during the Siege, is mounted on the stylobate (facing the Free State), surrounded by shells from the Boer Long Tom.|$|E
500|$|Many {{survivors}} of the tragedy refused to blame anyone. Survivor John Jacques wrote, [...] "I blame nobody. I am not anxious to blame anybody... I {{have no doubt that}} those who had to do with its management meant well and tried to do the best they could under the circumstances." [...] Another survivor, Francis Webster, was quoted as having said, [...] "Was I sorry that I chose to come by hand cart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> <b>we</b> paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Hand Cart Company." [...] On the other hand, survivor John Chislett, who later left the Church, wrote bitterly of Richards promising them that [...] "we should get to Zion in safety." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 13, the {{campaign}} released a [...] called [...] "Tough on Terror" [...] {{in which a}} hypothetical terrorist attack occurs in a shopping mall.

[...] Since its release, the ad received criticism from some who called it [...] "cheap" [...] and [...] "blatant fearmongering." [...] Bowdoin College political scientist Michael Franz likened the advertisement to the Daisy ad run by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 Presidential election claiming that the election of Barry Goldwater would lead to a nuclear war. The other Republican candidates in the race did not comment on the ad.|$|E

2500|$|Israeli {{officials}} said the British informed them Friday {{that they would be}} withdrawing the monitoring team but did not provide a date. U.S. {{officials said}} the Israelis and the Palestinians were notified as the three British guards on duty at the time departed. Stuart Tuttle, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, said that [...] "The withdrawal decision was made on the ground and not in coordination with the Israelis". Senior U.S. {{officials said the}}y {{had no choice but to}} abandon the facility, even though they realized it might undermine the Palestinian Authority, and that they did not make public their concerns because they believed publicity would have made the U.S. and British personnel the targets of attacks. A senior administration official said: [...] "That is <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>we</b> pay. Our first responsibility is the safety of American and British monitors". State Department spokesman J. Adam Ereli denied any coordination with Israel and said: [...] "Such accusations are baseless and ignore the facts, quite frankly".|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} profitability from secondary spectrum provision under unknown {{relationships between}} price charged for spectrum use and demand drawn at <b>the</b> given <b>price.</b> <b>We</b> show that profitability {{is governed by}} the applied admission policy and <b>the</b> <b>price</b> charged to secondary users. We explicitly identify a critical price (market entry price) such that if secondary demand is charged below that <b>price,</b> <b>the</b> licensee endures losses from spectrum provision, regardless of the applied admission policy. Furthermore, we show that an admission policy that admits secondary demand only when no channel is occupied is profitable for any <b>price</b> that exceeds <b>the</b> critical <b>price.</b> <b>We</b> prove that this policy is profit-robust to variations in secondary demand, i. e., if the policy is profitable for a certain price, it will be profitable for any secondary demand that <b>the</b> <b>price</b> generates, as long as <b>the</b> <b>price</b> generates demand. <b>We</b> also investigate profitability from a set of policies that allow more secondary users to access spectrum by defining the number of users that can be concurrently served. Our results demonstrate profit-robustness of these policies and explicitly characterize profitable <b>prices.</b> <b>We</b> provide a numerical study to verify our theoretical findings. I...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that auction winners sometimes fall prey to a "bidder's curse", paying more for an item at auction {{than they would have}} paid at a posted price. One explanation for this phenomenon is that bidders are inattentive to posted <b>prices.</b> <b>We</b> develop a model in which bidders' inattention, and subsequent overbidding, is driven by a rational response to the opportunity cost of acquiring information about <b>the</b> posted <b>price.</b> <b>We</b> test our model in a laboratory experiment in which subjects bid in an auction while facing an opportunity cost of looking up <b>the</b> posted <b>price.</b> <b>We</b> vary <b>the</b> opportunity cost, and we show that information acquisition decreases and consequently overbidding increases with opportunity cost as predicted...|$|R
2500|$|New York Times critic Manohla Dargis, who {{designated}} the film a New York Times critics' pick, {{said that the}} film [...] "shows {{the dark side of}} that war. It shows the unspeakable and lets us decide if the death of Bin Laden was worth <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>we</b> paid." [...] Continued Dargis: There is much else to say about the movie, which ends with the harrowing siege of Bin Laden's hideaway by the Navy SEALs (played by, among others, Joel Edgerton and Chris Pratt), much of it shot to approximate the queasy, weirdly unreal green of night-vision goggles. Ms. Bigelow's direction here is unexpectedly stunning, at once bold and intimate: she has a genius for infusing even large-scale action set pieces with the human element. One of the most significant images is of a pool of blood on a floor. It's pitiful, really, and as the movie heads toward its emphatically non-triumphant finish, it is impossible not to realize with anguish that all that came before– the pain, the suffering and the compromised ideals– has led to this.|$|E
