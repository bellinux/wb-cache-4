25|$|While {{the main}} intent of DRM {{is to prevent}} {{unauthorized}} copies of a product, there are mathematical models that suggest that DRM schemes can fail <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> on multiple levels. Ironically, the biggest failure that can result from DRM {{is that they have}} a potential to increase the infringement rate of a product. This goes against the held belief that DRM can always reduce unauthorized distribution. There also seems to be evidence that DRM will reduce profits.|$|E

Members of the Ushers' Club also serve the church by volunteering their time and labor at the social activities of the parish.|$|E
500|$|The {{reaction}} to the decision was negative, with academics accusing the majority Law Lords of failing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> {{as members of the}} judiciary to [...] "rework things like neo-imperial texts and outdated legal attitudes to the prerogative in order to cure obvious injustices and to vindicate a modern conception of the rule of law"; at the same time, their approach to legitimate expectation was also questioned, with the case described as an [...] "unfortunate regression" [...] from Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service, where judges were willing to debate legitimate expectation in a similarly politically sensitive situation.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the amount of {{training}} received by employees; the extent to which individuals are dissatisfied with the training they receive; and employee perceptions of the extent to which the skill levels they possess are higher than/lower than those required <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> Design/methodology/approach - A matched workplace-employee data set which has its origins in the 2004 Workplace Employment Relations Survey is created and analysed using ordered and binomial logits. Findings - One in five employees received five days or more training within the last 12 months. One in three received no training at all. One in three are satisfied with the training they received. One in four are dissatisfied. More than half of all employees felt that their skill levels are higher than those required <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> Only 5 percent felt that their skill levels are lower than those required <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> Research limitations/implications - There is little evidence of "skills gaps. " However, there is much evidence to the effect that employees' skills capacities are under-utilised. Originality/value - The contribution made both to the skills and training policy agenda and the controversy over explanations of the UK's relatively low rate of productivity growth...|$|R

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the incident, media attention drew parallels with a similar previous fatalities to pedestrians in Glasgow city centre, in which two girls were killed on a 2010 Christmas shopping trip by a Range Rover that hit them on the pavement in North Hanover Street. The mothers said they were still waiting for the Crown Office <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>job.</b> Charges against the driver of the Range Rover, a 53-year-old man, were dropped. He testified at an official inquiry that prior to the incident in which the girls were killed he had suffered [...] blackouts, and the deaths were as a result of him suffering a loss of consciousness owing to an undiagnosed medical condition, which he had failed to disclose when submitting his driving licence application. The case received a great deal of newspaper and television publicity when the inquiry ended in November 2014 and the bereaved families [...] called for him to face charges.|$|E
2500|$|Where a lock is tidal (i.e. {{one side}} of the lock has water whose level varies with the tide) or where a canal meets a river whose level may vary, the water on the tidal or river side (the [...] "downstream" [...] side) may rise above the water on the normal [...] "upper" [...] side. The [...] "upstream" [...] {{pointing}} doors will then fail <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>job,</b> and will simply drift open. To prevent water flowing the wrong way through the lock, there will need to be at least one set of gates pointing in the [...] "wrong" [...] direction. If it is desirable that boats can use the lock in these circumstances, then {{there needs to be a}} full set of gates pointing towards the tidal or river side. The usual method is to have gates pointing in opposite directions at both ends of the chamber (alternatively, the [...] "paired stop lock" [...] arrangement of two separate sequential locks pointing in opposite directions would work here – but would require an extra chamber). If navigation is not required (or impossible) at one [...] "extreme" [...] (e.g. allow navigation above mid-tide, but just prevent the canal emptying at low tide) then it is only necessary to have one set of bi-directional gates.|$|E
