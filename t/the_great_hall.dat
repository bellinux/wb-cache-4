5|$|British Railways {{announced}} a complete rebuild of Euston that could accommodate a fully electrified West Coast Main Line in 1959. Because of the restricted layout of track and tunnels {{at the northern}} end, enlargement could be accomplished only by expanding southwards over the area occupied by <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Hall</b> and the Arch. Consequently, the London County Council were given notice that the Arch and <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Hall</b> would be demolished, which was granted on the proviso that the Arch would be restored and re-sited. This was financially unviable as BR estimated it would cost at least £190,000 (now £).|$|E

50|$|The Buta Palace {{is one of}} the {{principal}} performing arts centers and music venues of Baku. It consists of two event halls and adjacent parking lot for 800 cars. <b>The</b> <b>greater</b> <b>hall</b> is a caravanserai-stylized venue, capable of accommodating about 2,000 visitors. The minor hall is designed for conferences and presentations and can house 400 visitors. The size of <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> <b>hall</b> is 1572 m2 and the minor hall — 652 m2.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Hall</b> is {{furnished}} with mostly 17th century oak furniture, including tables, coffers and wainscot chairs, {{and a great}} dining table, on which stand two blue and white late 17th century Delftware pyramidal tulip vases. One treasure of the home is the Lytes Herbal, a 16th-century botanical volume by noted horticulturist Henry Lyte, who was born and resided at the manor. Lyte's Niewe Herball was published in 1578 and was a translation and elaboration of the Cruydeboeck of Flemish herbalist Rembert Dodoens. The herbal was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth. A copy is displayed in <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Hall.</b>|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the inner}} ward was the castle's Great Hall and accommodation. Caerphilly was built with fashionable, high-status accommodation, {{similar to that}} built {{around the same time}} in Chepstow Castle. In the medieval period <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Hall</b> would have been {{subdivided}} with wooden screens, colourful decorations, with rich, detailed carving and warmed by a large, central fireplace. Some carved medieval corbels in the shape of male and female heads survive in the hall today, possibly depicting the royal court in the 1320s, including Edward II, Isabella of France, Hugh Despenser and Eleanor de Clare. To the east of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Hall</b> was the castle chapel, positioned above the buttery and pantry. On {{the west side of the}} hall were the castle's private apartments, two solar blocks with luxurious fittings.|$|E
5|$|Montacute, {{like many}} Elizabethan mansions, is built in an 'E' shape, a much-used plan in this era. On {{the ground floor}} was <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>hall,</b> kitchens and pantries, on the upper floors, {{retiring}} rooms for the family and honoured guests. Over the centuries, the layout and use of rooms changed: drawing and dining rooms evolved on the ground floor.|$|E

5|$|Opposite the entrance, {{and running}} across {{the middle of the}} court, was <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>hall</b> of the castle, with a grand porch and steps leading up to the first floor, where prestigious guests would have been entertained amongst carved wall-panels and murals. The design of the hall may have {{emulated}} Gaunt's hall at Kenilworth; at the very least, it was a powerful symbol of Thomas's authority and status. The west side of the inner court included the castle kitchen, bakery, well and other service facilities; on the east side was the lord's great chamber and a range of other accommodation for other guests. Behind <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>hall</b> was a smaller courtyard or garden. Thomas appears to have built up his new castle in stages, with the curtain wall being built first, with the corner towers added afterwards.|$|E

5|$|The porch {{leads into}} <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>hall</b> {{which has a}} Minton tile floor and a large stone chimney piece. In the east wing is the long gallery which has oak panelling, a chimney-piece and a {{panelled}} ceiling. Behind the long gallery is an irregularly-shaped billiard room and the drawing room. To the south {{of these is the}} library. Behind <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>hall</b> is the main staircase. The circular tower at the north-west corner contains the octagonal dining room with a Minton tile floor, two fireplaces, and a vault of eight radial ribs running to a central boss. The room contains an oak sideboard with a carved Green Man. Below the dining room is a wine cellar. On the fifth floor of the circular tower is a room designed for playing rackets, which is approached by a stone spiral staircase.|$|E

5|$|The square Little Stair Tower was the {{entrance}} from the bailey to the withdrawing rooms south of <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>hall.</b> At ground floor level {{there was a}} doorway {{in each of the}} tower's faces. Directly south of {{the east side of the}} tower was the castle's chapel. The northern door led to <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>hall,</b> and the western door to a cellar under the great chamber. There are only fragmentary remains of the spiral staircase. Above the passageway was a single room, of uncertain purpose: it may have been used as another chapel, a guest room, or an antechamber where guests would wait before being admitted into the earl's presence.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of direct American involvement in World War II, the U.S. government bought the building and converted it to federal offices, officer billets, spaces used by the Army's Ordnance Procurement department, a passport agency and an induction center run by the local draft board.

5|$|Building of {{the palace}} started around 1210 by Bishops Jocelin of Wells and Reginald Fitz Jocelin. The chapel and great hall were added by Bishop Robert Burnell between 1275 and 1292. The walls, {{gatehouse}} and moat were added in the 14th century by Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury. The Bishops House was added in the 15th century by Bishop Thomas Beckington. <b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>hall</b> later fell into disrepair and was partially demolished around 1830.|$|E
5|$|Conwy Castle was {{not well}} {{maintained}} during the early 14th century and by 1321 a survey reported it was poorly equipped, with limited stores and suffering from leaking roofs and rotten timbers.

Sir John Weston, his chamberlain, conducted repairs, building new stone support arches for <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>hall</b> {{and other parts of the}} castle.
