2500|$|The {{process of}} <b>technology</b> <b>transition</b> & human capital {{capacity-building}} initiated in India during the 1960s started bearing its fruits in the mid-1990 and dove-tailed neatly with {{the adoption of}} economic reforms rendered inevitable {{after the end of}} the Cold War. Reduced venture capital facilities forced educated entrepreneurs to leverage intra-familial/neighbourhood angel investors to create technology start-ups right from the beginning of the digital Revolution, many of which have matured into niche/sectoral leaders (Biocon, Reddy Labs, Sun-Ranbaxy, Dishman, Wipro, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro, Welspun, Suzlon, Vedanta, Reliance). Prudent opening-up of the Indian economy has allowed long established domestic business conglomerates (Tata, Mahindra, Birla, Bajaj, Kirloskar, Godrej, TVS, Essar) to select optimums in production–possibilities in preparation for competition in the domestic markets from global heavy-weights. Corporate India is increasingly using the public-private partnership model to cater to India's vast public infrastructure requirements.|$|E

40|$|At {{the heart}} of <b>technology</b> <b>transitions</b> lie complex {{processes}} of social and industrial dynamics. The quantitative study of sustainability transitions requires modelling work, which necessitates a theory of technology substitution. Many, if not most, contemporary modelling approaches for future technology pathways overlook most aspects of transitions theory, for instance dimensions of heterogenous investor choices, dynamic rates of diffusion and the profile of transitions. A significant body of literature however exists that demonstrates how transitions follow S-shaped diffusion curves or Lotka-Volterra systems of equations. This framework is used ex-post since timescales can only be reliably obtained {{in cases where the}} transitions have already occurred, precluding its use for studying cases of interest where nascent innovations in protective niches await favourable conditions for their diffusion. In principle, scaling parameters of transitions can, however, be derived from knowledge of industrial dynamics, technology turnover rates and technology characteristics. In this context, this paper presents a theory framework for evaluating the parameterisation of S-shaped diffusion curves for use in simulation models of <b>technology</b> <b>transitions</b> without the involvement of historical data fitting, making use of standard demography theory applied to technology at the unit level. The classic Lotka-Volterra competition system emerges from first principles from demography theory, its timescales explained in terms of technology lifetimes and industrial dynamics.

40|$|<b>Technology</b> <b>transitions</b> are {{essential}} to transforming air traffic management to meet future capacity needs. Encouraging and obtaining equipage adoption is one crucial aspect of <b>technology</b> <b>transitions.</b> We propose an approach for developing appropriate strategies to persuade aviation stakeholders to <b>transition</b> to new <b>technologies.</b> Our approach uses cost, benefit, and value distribution across stakeholders and over time to determine which strategies are most appropriate to persuading aircraft operators to adopt new equipage. Equipage that may show an overall positive value can nevertheless fail to provide value to individual stakeholders. Such imbalances in value distribution between stakeholders or over time may lead to stakeholder intransigence and can stymie efforts to transform air traffic management systems. Leverage strategies that correct these imbalances and accelerate the realization of value for all stakeholders can enhance cooperation and {{increase the likelihood of}} a successful transition to the new technology. We demonstrate the application of the approach using the case of automatic dependent surveillancebroadcast (ADS-B).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{demonstrates that}} valuable strategic insight and a reasonable measure of predictive {{power can be}} obtained by developing and analyzing context-rich parsimonious game theoretic strategy models during large <b>technology</b> <b>transitions</b> in concentrated industries. Such models enable clear and compact analysis of oligopolistic competitive dynamics which are typically addressed by more informal processes in much of current managerial practice. This result is established by constructing 3 -player game theory models of two prominent, ongoing <b>technology</b> <b>transitions</b> in semiconductor manufacturing: EUV lithography (EUVL) and 450 mm silicon wafers. The iterative multi-data-source process used for establishing appropriate game structures and payoff estimates is described in detail. Contextual realism was augmented by in-depth behavioral analysis of select industry players and by interactions with the equipment supplier facing groups at a semiconductor device manufacturer. The robust game theoretic prediction from the EUV lithography R&D model was subsequently validated by the announcement of a series of chipmaker investments totaling greater than $ 6 B in the largest photolithography supplier in July/August 2012 (including significant financial assistance to EUV equipment readiness) and by several other industry financing events in late 2012. Although no such distinct confirmatory evidence exists for the 450 mm wafer model predictions, it was found to have substantial face validity. Based on learning from the modeling efforts, criteria are proposed for determining whether other <b>technology</b> <b>transitions</b> will be amenable to such analysis. Generalizability to similar transitions in other industries (including aerospace and automotive) is discussed. Industry strategists, technology and business strategy scholars, and innovation policy makers should find the work of interest. by George Thomas Heaps-Nelson. Thesis (Ph. D.)
