On January 27, 1871, he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing a bill that would have provided fifty-seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to further their westward expansion. In the speech, Knott singled out the Bayfield and St. Croix Railroad's proposed line from the St. Croix River to Duluth, Minnesota <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>point.</b> He derided the remoteness of the town and the need for a railroad to it by repeatedly referring to a map and asking where Duluth was located.

25|$|The 2220 {{defeat of}} Cumberland {{was the largest}} margin of victory in {{football}} history. Cumberland, a Presbyterian school in Lebanon, Tennessee, had discontinued its football program before the season but {{was not allowed to}} cancel its game against the Engineers. The fact that Cumberland's baseball team had crushed Georgia Tech earlier that year 220 (amidst allegations that Cumberland used professionals as ringers) probably accounted for Georgia Tech coach John Heisman's running up the score on the Bulldogs. (Heisman was also the Engineers' baseball coach.) Another possible reason for Heisman's plan to run up the score was the practice among the sportswriters of the time to rank teams based on how many points they scored. Since this statistic did not account for the strength or weakness of a team's opponent, Heisman disagreed with the amount of weight the writers tended to assign to it, and he may have unleashed his players on Cumberland <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
500|$|On {{the basis}} of Colonel Campbell's letter, Prabhu concludes that the [...] "Native Christian" [...] {{soldiers}} present in the fort were probably all East Indian infantry and artillery experts, belonging to the Bombay Natives. He believes that at best, any assistance was of a limited nature and restricted to purely individual enterprise. Prabhu points out that European troops, both English and French, including those from Tipu's own mercenaries, did receive some assistance although this was more humanitarian than military. He also states that claim of the Christians paying the British Rs.

2500|$|In 1999 Yad Vashem {{historian}} Avraham Milgram {{published a}} study where {{he asserted that}} [...] "the discrepancy between the reality and {{the myth of the}} number of visas granted by Sousa Mendes is great." [...] According to Milgram it was probably Harry Ezratty who was the first to mention in an article published in 1964 that Sousa Mendes had saved 30,000 refugees, of which 10,000 were Jews, a number which has since then been repeated automatically by journalists and academics. Milgram says that Ezratty, imprudently, took the total number of Jewish refugees who passed through Portugal and ascribed it to the work of Aristides de Sousa Mendes. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>point</b> Milgram cross checked the numbers from the Bordeaux ‘s visa register entry books with those of the HICEM reports and although he acknowledged that visas delivered in cities of Bayonne, Hendaye and Toulouse cannot be exactly determined, Milgram asserted that the numbers are exaggerated. Again in 2011, Milgram published a densely researched book, “Portugal Salazar and the Jews” and for a second time he asserted that: [...] "authors, especially those who wish to sing the praises of Aristides de Sousa Mendes, tend to overstate the number of visas with figures that not satisfy research criteria, but rather correspond to their wishful thinking".|$|E

500|$|Dunne {{had never}} found the actual {{writing of the}} Dooley pieces difficult, once he got started—it was finding that initial inspiration, and putting himself in a {{suitable}} frame of mind to compose, that he found increasingly hard after 1905. Aware that the columns were reaching an audience of millions and would be reviewed by critics when placed in book form, Dunne was reluctant to release pieces he considered substandard, and defended his position strongly in correspondence with the syndicators. In 1906, he joined with Ida Tarbell and Lincoln Steffens in forming The American Magazine, a project that occupied time and energy, especially since his regular column, [...] "In the Interpreter's House", contained musings like Mr. Dooley's but without brogue or barroom.

6000|$|The Admiral seldom read newspapers; {{and when}} he did he never {{believed}} anything they said. He read nothing, and believed in nothing, but [...] "The Old Guard," [...] a secession periodical published in New York. He carried a dozen copies of it with him, always, and referred to them for all required information. If it was not there, he supplied it himself, out of a bountiful fancy, inventing history, names, dates, and every thing else necessary <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>point</b> good in an argument. Consequently he was a formidable antagonist in a dispute. Whenever he swung clear of the record and began to create history, the enemy was helpless and had to surrender. Indeed, the enemy could not keep from betraying some little spark of indignation at his manufactured history--and when it came to indignation, that was the Admiral's very [...] "best hold." [...] He was always ready for a political argument, and if nobody started one he would do it himself. With his third retort his temper would begin to rise, and within five minutes he would be blowing a gale, and within fifteen his smoking-room audience would be utterly stormed away and the old man left solitary and alone, banging the table with his fist, kicking the chairs, and roaring a hurricane of profanity. It got so, after a while, that whenever the Admiral approached, with politics in his eye, the passengers would drop out with quiet accord, afraid to meet him; and he would camp on a deserted field.|$|E

Its immediate effect had been indeed rather to lighten insistence--almost to provoke a reaction; as if their topic had dropped by its own weight and as if moreover, for that matter, Marcher had been visited by one of his occasional warnings against egotism. He had kept up, he felt, and very decently on the whole, his consciousness of the importance of not being selfish, and it was true that he had never sinned in that direction without promptly enough trying to press the scales the other way. He often repaired his fault, the season permitting, by inviting his friend to accompany him to the opera; and it not infrequently thus happened that, to show he didn't wish her to have but one sort of food for her mind, he was the cause of her appearing there with him a dozen nights in the month. It even happened that, seeing her home at such times, he occasionally went in with her to finish, as he called it, the evening, and, the better <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>point,</b> sat down to the frugal but always careful little supper that awaited his pleasure. His point was made, he thought, by his not eternally insisting with her on himself; made for instance, at such hours, when it befell that, her piano at hand and each of them familiar with it, they went over passages of the opera together. It chanced to be on one of these occasions, however, that he reminded her of her not having answered a certain question he had put to her during the talk that had taken place between them on her last birthday. [...] "What is it that saves you?"--saved her, he meant, from that appearance of variation from the usual human type. If he had practically escaped remark, as she pretended, by doing, in the most important particular, what most men do--find the answer to life in patching up an alliance of a sort with a woman no better than himself--how had she escaped it, and how could the alliance, such as it was, since they must suppose it had been more or less noticed, have failed to make her rather positively talked about? ...|$|E

40|$|In his User 2 ̆ 7 s Manual, David Treuer reviews many of {{the works}} of {{contemporary}} Native American writers as well as Henry Rowe Schoolcraft and Asa Carter to demonstrate that 2 ̆ 2 {{there is no such thing}} as Native American Literature-at least, no such thing as Native American novels anyway. 2 ̆ 2 For Treuer, good literature is good literature and the standards that govern the great works of Western literature govern novels by Native writers. He sees the inclusion of myth, oral tradition, and ceremony as a longing for culture and not culture itself and believes that readers and writers have misconstrued artistic structure for authenticity. Certainly he has a point if one were to look at criticism of Native American literature from the 1970 s and 1980 s, but both the positions of writers and the approaches of critics in the 1990 s did not lean in that direction. Fortunately for Treuer, he did not really need to look at much criticism <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>points.</b> <b>His</b> whole section on Silko 2 ̆ 7 s Ceremony ignores the vast scholarship of thirty years, because, though the novel takes place in Laguna Pueblo, he finds more relevant connections to Chateaubriand, Hemingway, and Luke Skywalker. 2 ̆ 2 The problem-and this extends to most other Native American novels-with interpreting Ceremony, 2 ̆ 2 he writes, 2 ̆ 2 is one of orientation: it is fruitless to ask about where the book is coming from. It is much more interesting to look at where it is going and to ask how the reader is being carried along. 2 ̆ 2 Many scholars have done this, and Silko even suggests answers to the question. The reader may be carried to new perspectives on a different worldview, and the characters return to reestablish a new equilibrium at their places of origin...|$|R
