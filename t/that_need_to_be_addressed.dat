25|$|The {{reason for}} psychology's fractionation, {{according}} to the ToK, {{is that there has}} been no meta-theoretical frame that allows scholars to agree on the basic questions <b>that</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed.</b> As such, the different schools of thought in psychology are like the blind men who each grab a part of the elephant and proclaim they have discovered its true nature. With its novel depiction of evolving dimensions of complexity, the ToK allows scholars finally to see the elephant. In his 2003 Review of General Psychology paper, Henriques used the ToK System with the attempt to clarify and align the views of B.F. Skinner and Sigmund Freud. These luminaries were chosen because when one considers their influence and historical opposition, it can readily be argued that they represent two schools of thought that are the most difficult to integrate. Henriques used the meta-perspective offered by the ToK to argue how one can retain the key insights from each school of thought, identify errors and points of confusion, and integrate the insights into a coherent whole.|$|E
25|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{strategy}} {{is to increase the}} modal share of the bicycle to 50% of commuter trips, and make Copenhagen the best cycling city in the world. The city has used the biennial bicycle accounts to identify key problems <b>that</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> in order to increase the modal share, and plans employing a number of tools to reach its target. These include widening cycle tracks to 3 lanes to allow for conversational cycling and increase the sense of safety on the cycle tracks, {{while at the same time}} allowing for higher speeds among commuters. The city further plans to decrease travel times by expanding the use of green waves adjusted to cycling speeds, and building additional bicycle and pedestrian only bridges across busy streets and over the harbour and canals. The city also plans to increase safety by redesigning a number of intersections with a high number of accidents, and rebuilding school routes with safer infrastructure, and speed decreasing measures. Finally the strategy also aims to improve the chaotic bicycle parking conditions, by greatly expanding the number of parking spaces, especially in and around stations.|$|E

500|$|Further {{criticism}} {{came from}} the 2009 NAS report on {{the current state of}} various forensic fields in the United States. The report's section on firearm examination focused on the lack of defined requirements that are necessary in order to determine [...] "matches" [...] between known and unknown striations. [...] The NAS stated that, [...] "sufficient studies have not been done to understand the reliability and repeatability of the methods." [...] Without defined procedures on what is and what isn't considered [...] "sufficient agreement" [...] the report states that forensic firearm examination contains fundamental problems <b>that</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> by the forensic community through a set of repeatable scientific studies that outline standard operating procedures that should be adopted by all firearm examiners. Another report issued in 2016 by the United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology confirmed the NAS's findings, finding only one appropriately designed study that examined the rate of false positives and reliability amongst firearm examiners.|$|E

[...] A study by the CDC suggests that newborn circumcision would be societally cost-effective in the United States based on circumcision's efficacy against the heterosexual transmission of HIV alone, without considering any other cost benefits. [...] The American Academy of Pediatrics (2012) recommends that neonatal circumcision in the United States be covered by third-party payers such as Medicaid and insurance. A 2014 review that considered reported benefits of circumcision such as reduced risks from HIV, HPV, and HSV-2 stated that circumcision is cost-effective in both the United States and Africa and may result in health care savings.

During the events in Diyarbakır, forensic examinations of detained were carried out in places of detention. According to the Report of the Commission, [...] "this contravenes the rules and the circulars issued by the Ministries of Justice and Health as well as the independence of the medical profession".

2500|$|Jarmakani {{argues that}} because of the {{dominant}} representation of Arab women given by the Bush administration many individuals in western societies have an orientalist point of view, have Islamophobia and believe that Arab feminism cannot exist.The reason for this is because the Bush administration led the, [...] "invasion of Afghanistan, as a project of liberation meant to save Afghan women from the oppression of the Taliban," [...] this did not allow for the idea that there could be Arab feminism. Jarmakani explains that US based Feminist Majority Foundation has taken on the role of savior instead of fighting with Arab feminists for issues that they believed were important topics <b>that</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>addressed</b> in their communities. This coupled with the invasion led to, [...] "reify stereotypical notions of Arab and Muslim womanhood as monolithically oppressed. They depend on a set of U.S. cultural mythologies about the Arab and Muslim worlds, which are often promulgated through overdetermined signifiers, like the “veil” (the English term collapsing a range of cultural and religious dress expressing modesty, piety, or identity, or all three)". She then concludes {{that because of}} the symbols that are used to reinforce this they, [...] "threaten to eclipse the creative work of Arab American feminists. Because the mythologies are so pervasive, operating subtly and insidiously on the register of “common sense,” Arab American feminists are often kept oriented toward correcting these common misconceptions rather than focusing on our own agendas and concerns." [...] Because of these symbols, Arab women are placed in a paradox where, “ the marker (supposedly) of invisibility and cultural authenticity, renders Arab and Muslim womanhood as simultaneously invisible and hypervisible” because the veil is seen as a form of oppression and becomes well known in the western societies as an oppressive form therefore it brings hypervisibility to these women.|$|E
