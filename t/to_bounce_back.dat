25|$|With the Great Depression and {{the rise}} of the automobile, the rail lines began to decline.

However, the restrictions also hit TCRT itself since they could not afford to build many new streetcars. The company was forced to add more buses to shore up the system's various routes.|$|E
25|$|The Wallabies's unbeaten run {{stretched}} to 8 matches with a 12-all draw with New Zealand, prompting optimism that Australia could finally reclaim the Bledisloe Cup {{for the first}} time since 2002, in addition to ending their 28-year winless run at Eden Park. However, Australia came crashing back to earth, suffering a 51-20 defeat during the second Bledisloe test, staged at the venue, stretching Australia's Bledisloe Cup drought to a 12th year. Australia managed <b>to</b> <b>bounce</b> <b>back</b> from that defeat, with hard fought 24-23 and 32-25 wins over South Africa and Argentina, with the latter win ensuring that Australia retained the Puma Trophy.|$|E

In 1936, the ambitious Juan Culiolo took over as chairman of the club; in 1936–37 they achieved a 6th-place finish and also won the Coppa Italia by beating Roma 1–0 with a goal from Mario Torti.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the characteristics of leaders who have experienced a setback or failure and have <b>bounced</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> success. A qualitative research design employing an interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) methodology was used. Semi-structured interviews with open ended questions allowed the respondents to share valuable insights into the thoughts, feelings, and perceptions of their individual experiences. The results suggest that after experiencing a setback, a process develops where feelings and thoughts are experienced immediately following the event that is followed by a period of coping and adapting, a transition to a resilient state, and behavioral changes that lead <b>to</b> <b>bouncing</b> <b>back...</b>|$|R

25|$|DC hoped <b>to</b> <b>bounce</b> <b>back</b> {{in their}} home opener against the Colorado Rapids, but the team only managed a 1-1 draw thanks to Espindola coming off the bench and {{chipping}} a rebound into the net in the 80th minute. The following week, Steve Birnbaum and Álvaro Saborío were called up to their respective national teams in the US and Costa Rica. D.C. faced off against an FC Dallas side that was suffering even more losses from injury and national call-ups, but were crushed 3-0 after Dallas took advantage of multiple mistakes between Bobby Boswell and Kofi Opare, who filled in for Birnbaum.|$|E
25|$|Fresh {{off their}} {{stunning}} upset of the top-seeded Dallas Mavericks, the Golden State Warriors faced {{a very different}} team in Utah. The Warriors continued the frantic style of play they exhibited against the Mavericks, but the Jazz, a more defensive-minded team, managed to shut them down to take Game 1. The Warriors tried <b>to</b> <b>bounce</b> <b>back</b> in Game 2, and took the Jazz to overtime. But the Jazz were able to prevail, due to the inspired clutch play of guard Derek Fisher, who arrived at halftime after being {{with his family in}} New York City because of his daughter's emergency eye cancer surgery.|$|E

25|$|Essex were {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>bounce</b> <b>back</b> strongly after relegation {{from the top}} tier the season before. A five-wicket win at home to Yorkshire provided a good start to the league. A quickfire 99 from Ryan ten Doeschate clinched a tie away at Leicestershire soon after. The Eagles then extended their unbeaten run with a win away at Derbyshire, which included unbeaten centuries from Jason Gallian and Ravi Bopara, the former's coming off just 54 balls. Good quality bowling on an infrequently used wicket at Southend allowed Essex to bowl out Northants for just 61, before knocking off the total in just under 15 overs. Two days later The Eagles further consolidated their place {{at the top of}} the table with a victory over struggling Surrey in a rain-affected match at County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford. Promotion then seemed certain after Mark Pettini's 70 guided Essex to another win at Colchester against Glamorgan.|$|E
25|$|At {{the first}} race in Argentina, {{he felt the}} car was {{difficult}} to handle and on a fast lap, the front wing became detached striking his helmet. In the race, Hunt retired due to an electrical fault. In Brazil, he retired on lap 6 due to instability under braking caused by a loose steering rack. During qualifying in South Africa, the brakes on his car failed. He managed not to collide with the wall, but only finished 8th in the race. He retired at the Spanish Grand Prix after 26 laps. At Zolder, a new Wolf WR8 was raced but Hunt crashed into a barrier hard enough <b>to</b> <b>bounce</b> <b>back</b> onto the track. After failing to finish the 1979 Monaco Grand Prix, the race where six years previously {{he had made his}} debut, Hunt made a statement on 8 June 1979 to the press announcing his immediate retirement from F1 competition, citing his situation in the championship.

25|$|Following their {{exit from}} the FA Cup the {{previous}} weekend, a trip to Pride Park to play bottom-placed Derby County on 15 March looked {{to be the perfect}} opportunity for the Red Devils <b>to</b> <b>bounce</b> <b>back</b> and show their title credentials. However, the game did not prove as simple as one would have expected, as United had to work hard for their narrow 1–0 victory. As was the case with many of Manchester United's games in the 2007–08 season, luck was not on their side in the opening exchanges of the game. United goalkeeper Ben Foster, making his debut due to the unavailability of Van der Sar and Tomasz Kuszczak, then staked his claim to the number 1 jersey with a pair of fine saves from Derby striker Kenny Miller. Cristiano Ronaldo proved to be the thorn in Derby's side on a number of occasions, testing former Manchester United goalkeeper Roy Carroll with a curling effort hit with the outside of his foot and a 40-yard free kick. The breakthrough finally came in the 76th minute, Ronaldo scoring a deserved goal from a Wayne Rooney cross. With Arsenal only managing a draw against ten-man Middlesbrough in the day's late kick-off, United's win put them on top of the table on goal difference with a game in hand.|$|E

25|$|Seattle would trail {{early in}} the first quarter as 49ers kicker Joe Nedney got a 37-yard field goal, along with running back Frank Gore getting a 79-yard {{touchdown}} run. The Seahawks would respond in the second quarter as kicker Olindo Mare made a 36-yard field goal. San Francisco would reply with Nedney making a 42-yard field goal. As the Seahawks looked <b>to</b> <b>bounced</b> <b>back</b> from the deficit, quarterback Matt Hasselbeck received an injury as he was hit on the ground by 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis. Hasselbeck would leave the game with cracked ribs, yet Seattle closed out the half with backup Seneca Wallace completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to running back Julius Jones.|$|R
25|$|Coming off a huge {{upset the}} {{previous}} week against Oregon, Cal was looking <b>to</b> <b>bounce</b> <b>back</b> against #7 USC. The Bears were able to drive downfield on their first possession after taking the opening kickoff. However, after Kevin Riley threw his first interception of the season to USC safety Taylor Mays in the end zone, the Bears, would remain scoreless until the fourth quarter. The Trojans capitalized on the turnover, with Joe McKnight breaking free for a 38-yard touchdown. Following a USC field goal, the Trojans attempted a fourth down conversion in the closing seconds of the first quarter, but were held by the Bears. Cal however was unable to move the ball and after being driven back to their 24-yard line by a 15-yard penalty, were forced to punt. USC wide receiver Damian Williams then returned the punt 66 {{yards for a touchdown}} and the Trojans added a field goal late in the second quarter. Cal was able to drive downfield in the final minute and a half to the USC 21-yard line, but missed a 38-yard field goal to make it 20–0 at the half. The Bears were able to hold the Trojans to a field goal in the third quarter, ending a streak of six scoreless quarters by kicking a field goal in the fourth quarter. The final Trojan score came on a four-yard rushing touchdown by Joe McKnight.|$|E
25|$|Ahead {{of their}} first final against {{cross-town}} rivals the Giants, the Swans confirmed that they would play all home finals at the SCG except for Sydney Derbies, which would be played at ANZ Stadium. The final would create history, being the first Sydney Derby to be played in a final. It {{was also the first}} time that the Giants would make the finals in their fifth year. In a low-scoring first half, the Swans were very competitive, trailing by only 2 points. However, a mark not paid to Isaac Heeney midway through the third quarter turned all the momentum the Giants way, as they kicked away to win by 36 points. The Swans only kicked 2 goals after half-time with Giant Jeremy Cameron outscoring them in the third quarter alone with 3 goals. They were quick <b>to</b> <b>bounce</b> <b>back</b> the following week, thumping the Adelaide Crows by 6 goals, with Franklin and Tom Papley kicking 4 goals a piece, after a blistering 7 goal to 1 quarter. The story was pretty much the same in the preliminary final against the Geelong Cats at the MCG. The Swans kept the Cats goalless for the first quarter, and were never really challenged in their 37-point triumph. It would take them to their third grand final in 5 years, against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. After leading by a scant 2 point margin at half time, the Bulldogs pulled away towards the end of the fourth quarter to hand Sydney their second grand final loss in three years.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2010–11 season, Morin had {{a strong}} {{training}} camp and made an impression on Blackhawks Head Coach Joel Quenneville, while tying for second on the team in pre-season scoring with four points. The Blackhawks, however, assigned Morin to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Rockford IceHogs, to begin the year. After playing eight games with Rockford, leading the team in power play goals with three, Morin was recalled from the AHL on November 5, 2010. He made his NHL debut {{the next day at}} Philips Arena against the team that originally drafted him, the Atlanta Thrashers. His first stint with the Blackhawks lasted two games, where he registered four shots on goal and two blocked shots; he reassigned to Rockford after only three days with Chicago. Following an injury to Marián Hossa, Morin was recalled as his replacement on November 30. At the time of his second call-up, Morin was leading the IceHogs in goals, with six, and was tied for third on the team with nine points. Later that day, in a game against the St. Louis Blues, Morin registered his first NHL point, a power play assist, and registered his first NHL fight in a bout with the Blues' Chris Porter. He played in the Blackhawks next two games, but six days later was again assigned to Rockford. The move, however, was believed to be an attempt at saving money against the team's salary cap. As anticipated, the Blackhawks recalled Morin prior to their next game against the Dallas Stars while placing Hossa on injured reserve. During the game, on December 8, Morin scored his first NHL goal, beating Andrew Raycroft 1:36 into the second period of a 5–3 Blackhawks victory. The Blackhawks' cap concerns remained, however, and Morin was again reassigned to Rockford the following day. He continued <b>to</b> <b>bounce</b> <b>back</b> and forth between Rockford and Chicago but with the return of Hossa and Viktor Stålberg from injury, Morin was not needed in the Blackhawks line-up and was subsequently loaned to Team USA for the 2011 World Junior Championships. Following the tournament, Morin returned to Rockford, but in mid-January, Morin suffered what was believed to be a concussion and missed the remainder of the season. He finished his first professional season playing in 31 games scoring ten goals and 15 points between the NHL and AHL.|$|E
