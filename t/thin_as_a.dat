25|$|Anglers {{of the era}} who {{ventured into}} the Esopus valley were usually advised by guidebooks and {{magazine}} articles touting the Catskills' trout populations to bypass the main stream {{in favor of the}} tributaries, since the Esopus itself was generally too warm for brook trout, the favored species at that time, and still too polluted by runoff from the tanneries. In the 1880s pioneering fish farmer Seth Green advocated the stocking of rainbow trout in streams where the brook trout population was beginning to <b>thin</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the fishing pressure, as they could handle warmer water better. Other anglers feared that, if introduced, the more aggressive rainbows would displace the native brooks.|$|E
25|$|Tāwari is a {{rich source}} of nectar, which is often so {{abundant}} that bees produce monofloral honey, that is the honey is chiefly made of nectar from Tāwari flowers. Tāwari honey is regularly for sale from food shops in New Zealand. The nectar contains a lot of fructose and much water. The honey may be <b>thin</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> consequence, but nonetheless crystallizes quickly. The honey has a light colour and tastes a bit like butterscotch. It contains relatively few pollen, and if at least 20% of the pollen is Tāwari, it can be marketed as Tāwari honey. Bark can produce a black dye that is known to be used on flax. Māori people use the flowers to make necklaces and other adornments to be worn at festivities.|$|E
500|$|After mating, the fertilized {{eggs are}} {{carried on the}} female's pleopods until they hatch, with between 120,000 and 680,000 carried by a single female. The eggs begin coral red, but darken as they develop to a deep maroon. When she is {{carrying}} the eggs, the female {{is said to be}} [...] "berried". The eggs are ready to hatch after 10 weeks, and spawning takes place from May to August, The larvae that hatch (called phyllosoma larvae) do not resemble the adults. Instead, they are flat, transparent animals around [...] long, but as <b>thin</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sheet of paper. The larvae feed on plankton, and grow through ten molts into ten further larval stages, the last of which is around [...] long. The full series of larval molts takes around 7 months, and when the last stage molts, it metamorphoses into the puerulus state, which is a juvenile form of the adult, albeit still transparent. The puerulus larvae settle to the sea floor when the water is near its maximum temperature, which in Baja California is in the fall.|$|E

30|$|According to our {{optimization}} results, it is optimal {{to carry}} out the first <b>thinning</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> early energy wood harvest (Policy II) for initially dense stands. For sparse stands, it is optimal to follow conventional forest management regimes (Policy 0). In addition, we found that a constraint of profitable energy wood harvest (Policy I) is not rational and may lead to a very early timing and extremely low intensity of the first thinning. This was caused by a thinning strategy that aimed at minimizing the negative outcome of a conventional first thinning.|$|R
2500|$|From {{early in}} the 19th century the {{existence}} of natural mineral waters was noted here and exploited. A local businessman Thomas Potter built, in 1831, the famous Ilkeston Bath {{at the bottom of}} Town Street attached to the Rutland Hotel. For over 60 years the baths helped tourism to the town at a time when spa towns like Bath and Harrogate enjoyed popularity. [...] 'If you're doubled in pain and <b>thin</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lath, Come at once then and try, the famed Ilkeston Bath,' was a well known advertising slogan. A mixture of a general decline in the popularity of spa bathing and, reportable, contamination of the waters from mining activities led to the eventual closure of the baths just before 1900. The baths and the adjacent Rutland Hotel, which also enjoyed a revenue from tourism, no longer exist though they are remembered in the name of 'Bath Street'.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{at least}} two {{versions}} about the recruitment of Bolin: Coverdale claims to have been the one who suggested auditioning Bolin. [...] "He walked in, <b>thin</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rake, his hair coloured green, yellow and blue with feathers in it. Slinking along beside him was this stunning Hawaiian girl in a crochet dress with nothing on underneath. He plugged into four Marshall 100-watt stacks and...the job was his". But in an interview originally published by Melody Maker in June 1975, Bolin himself claimed that he came to the audition following a recommendation from Blackmore. Bolin {{had been a member of}} many now-forgotten late-1960s bands – Denny & The Triumphs, American Standard, and Zephyr, which released three albums from 1969 to 1972. Before Deep Purple, Bolin's best-known recordings were made as a session musician on Billy Cobham's 1973 jazz fusion album Spectrum, and as lead guitarist on two post-Joe Walsh James Gang albums: Bang (1973) and Miami (1974). He had also jammed with such luminaries as Dr. John, Albert King, the Good Rats, Moxy and Alphonse Mouzon, and was busy working on his first solo album, Teaser, when he accepted the invitation to join Deep Purple.|$|E

50|$|Gamekeeper's {{thumb and}} skier's thumb are two similar conditions, {{both of which}} involve {{insufficiency}} of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the thumb. The chief {{difference between these two}} conditions is that Skier's thumb is generally considered to be an acute condition acquired after a fall or similar abduction injury to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the thumb, whereas gamekeeper's thumb typically refers to a chronic condition which has developed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of repeated episodes of lower-grade hyperabduction over a period of time. Gamekeeper's thumb is more difficult to treat because the UCL has lengthened and become <b>thinner</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of repeated injury.

5000|$|A {{close-coupled}} sedan is an obsolete type of {{car body}} which disappeared from the United States market by World War II, though it survived elsewhere for a time. It was a four-windowed sedan with a trunk that from front to rear was almost <b>as</b> <b>thin</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> upright suitcase. Such a vehicle was a bit lighter, and hence less expensive, than a regular sedan of the day, which had its rear-seat passengers sitting over the differential, and had room for a wider trunk at the rear, sometimes being a compartment added on not at the factory but by specialists. The passengers in a close-coupled sedan sat a little bit forward of the differential, so they had somewhat less room.|$|R
