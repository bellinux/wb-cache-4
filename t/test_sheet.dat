40|$|Abstract Background In 2004 the {{adoption}} of a modular curriculum at the medical faculty in Muenster led to the introduction of centralized examinations based on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). We report on how organizational challenges of realizing faculty-wide personalized tests were addressed by implementation of a specialized software module to automatically generate <b>test</b> <b>sheets</b> from individual <b>test</b> registrations and MCQ contents. Methods Key steps of the presented method for preparing personalized <b>test</b> <b>sheets</b> are (1) the compilation of relevant item contents and graphical media from a relational database with database queries, (2) the creation of Extensible Markup Language (XML) intermediates, and (3) the transformation into paginated documents. Results The software module by use of an open source print formatter consistently produced high-quality <b>test</b> <b>sheets,</b> while the blending of vectorized textual contents and pixel graphics resulted in efficient output file sizes. Concomitantly the module permitted an individual randomization of item sequences to prevent illicit collusion. Conclusions The automatic generation of personalized MCQ <b>test</b> <b>sheets</b> is feasible using freely available open source software libraries, and can be efficiently deployed on a faculty-wide scale. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} to use acidic hydrogen peroxide {{in the presence}} of ferrous ions (Fenton’s reagent) as a pre-treatment when producing microfibrillar cellulose (MFC) from a fully bleached birch (Betula verucosa) kraft pulp was investigated and the properties of the produced MFC was compared to the properties of a MFC produced with enzymatic pre-treatment with a monocomponent endoglucanase (FiberCare® R). The mechanical treatment to MFC was performed in a laboratory colloid mill or in a pilot high-pressure homogeniser and the pre-treated pulps as well as the produced MFCs were chemically and morphologically characterised. Additionally, the MFCs produced in the colloid mill were evaluated as strength enhancers in <b>test</b> <b>sheets</b> representing the middle ply of paperboard. From the chemical characterisation, it was concluded that the Fenton pre-treatment caused a decrease in the degree of polymerisation (DP) and an increase in both carboxyl- and carbonyl groups. The increase in carbonyl groups could not be explained by the formation of new reducing end groups due to depolymerisation which indicates that carbonyl groups are introduced along the cellulose chain. The enzymatic pre-treatment as performed in this study caused less impact on the cellulosic material, i. e. resulted in a pulp with a higher DP and a much lower amount of carbonyl- and carboxylic groups compared with the Fenton pre-treated pulps. In the subsequent mechanical treatment in a colloid mill, the Fenton pre-treated pulps were easier to process mechanically i. e. reached a higher specific surface area and a higher surface charge at a given mechanical treatment time compared to enzymatic pre-treated pulps and pulps not subjected to any pre-treatment. These findings were confirmed when MFCs were produced by homogenisation at high pressure in multiple passes; the birch kraft pulp was either pre-treated with Fenton’s reagent or the combined mechanic and enzymatic pre-treatment methodology used at the Centre Technique du Papier (CTP, France). By size fractionation, rheological measurements and scanning electron microscopy, it was revealed that Fenton pre-treatment resulted in MFC suspension containing a significantly higher proportion of small sized material (< 0. 2 mm). When the MFCs were evaluated as strength enhancers in <b>test</b> <b>sheets</b> produced from a furnish consisting of a spruce (Picea abies) chemithermomechanical pulp, MFC and a retention system containing cationic starch and an anionic silica sol, Fenton pre-treated MFCs increased the strength properties more than the enzymatic pre-treated MFCs. Addition of 5 wt% Fenton pre-treated MFC resulted in an increase in z-directional strength of about 50 %, an increase in tensile stiffness index of about 25 % and an increase in tensile index of 35 % compared to <b>test</b> <b>sheets</b> prepared without MFC addition.

40|$|Bonding and {{activation}} {{in paper}} were studied {{with the help}} of laboratory <b>test</b> <b>sheets</b> and common paper strength tests. Different papermaking furnishes and raw material treatments were used to examine the effects they have on bonding and activation. Furthermore, various boundary conditions during drying were included to single out the influence of bonding and activation on paper properties. It was found that bonding is clearly increased by beating of kraft pulp, starch addition, and thermomechanical pulp fines, whereas activation benefited most from beating and addition of reinforcement fibers to mechanical pulp based furnishes. Subjecting <b>test</b> <b>sheets</b> to increasing amounts of drying stress affected activation positively, and bonding negatively. The increase in activation {{did not seem to be}} dependent on the beating degree of chemical pulp fibers. Bonding, on the other hand, deteriorated more significantly in sheets made of extensively beaten kraft fibers, i. e. in sheets where the initial bonding potential was higher. Commonly used paper strength measurements provide dependable and accurate tools for assessing the effect of different variables on both bonding and activation.

40|$|Purpose: The aims of {{this paper}} is to {{quantify}} the state of cure by different techniques (physico-chemical; mechanical; thermal; spectroscopic) on the thick elastomeric composites (rubber parts). An optimization is aimed from the experimental results. For this purpose, a detailed comparison is carried out with simulation for industrial applications. Design/methodology/approach: Comparison among the used experimental methods for measuring curing phenomenon is made by choosing the following criteria: destructivity, need of specific sample geometry, reversion detection, error and timing; validation the numerical simulation with experimental results; As a first step, <b>test</b> <b>sheets</b> were obtained from the rubber-based compound. Different methods (DSC, NMR, mass swelling, tensile test, compression set test, relaxation, hardness, shear stress etc.) were used to quantify the state of cure experimentally. The same techniques were applied for evaluating the state of cure in a thick part obtained from the tested compound. Then the results for the thick part were correlated with the results for the <b>test</b> <b>sheets</b> obtained by rheometer. Finally, a comparison was carried out among the used methods by several criteria. Also numerical data obtained for evolution of state of cure in the thick parts is compared by means of special software with the experimental data. Findings: Applications of different methods have given very successful results for measuring the state of cure in the <b>test</b> <b>sheets.</b> However, the present results showed that some of the mechanical methods (shear stress, stress-strain, compression set and relaxation) are not suitable for measuring the state of cure in thick parts but NMR, DSC, mass swelling and hardness are very suitable. Research limitations/implications: Certain test such as shear stress and Dynamic Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) give high values of error and don’t detect reversion. Additionally, a specific geometry of the specimen is needed for relaxation and tensile tests. Practical implications: Certain tests such as mass swelling, tensile and hardness test give very practical and reliable results for measuring the state of cure in rubber parts in industrial applications. Originality/value: A good correlation has been found between numerical and experimental results which give the possibility to make a reliable prediction on the distribution of state of cure in thick parts.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand more accurately pathology of USN using a new HMD system. Methods Two stroke patients (Subject A and B) participated in this study after gaining their informed consent and they all had Left USN as determined by clinical tests. Assessments of USN were performed by using the common clinical test (the line cancellation test) and six special tests by using HMD system in the object-centered coordinates (OC) condition and the egocentric coordinates (EC) condition. OC condition focused the <b>test</b> <b>sheet</b> only by a CCD. EC condition was that CCD can always follow the subject's movement. Moreover, the study focused on the effect of the reduced image condition of real image and the arrows. Results In Patient A who performed the common test and special tests of OC and EC conditions, the results showed that for the line cancellation test under the common condition, both of the percentage of the correct answers at the right and left sides in the <b>test</b> <b>sheet</b> was 100 percent. However, in the OC condition, the percentage of the correct answers at the left side in the <b>test</b> <b>sheet</b> was 44 percent and the right side was 94 percent. In the EC condition, the left side was 61 percent and the right side was 67 percent. In Patient B, according to the result of the use of reduced image condition and the arrows condition by HMD system, these line cancellation scores more increased than the score of the common test. Conclusions The results showed that the assessment of USN using an HMD system may clarify the left neglect area which cannot be easily observed in the clinical evaluation for USN.
