5|$|According to {{the mission}} plan, the first {{helicopter}} would hover over the compound's yard while its full team of SEALs fast-roped to <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, the second helicopter would fly to {{the northeast corner of}} the compound and deploy the interpreter, the dog and handler, and four SEALs to secure the perimeter. The team in the courtyard was to enter the house from the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Early in the afternoon, the North Korean {{aircraft}} {{returned in}} larger numbers {{to attack the}} air transports. A flight of eight Ilyushin Il-10s appeared in the airspace between Seoul and Inchon, attempting to ambush transport aircraft while still on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> the airfields. The F-80s spotted the North Korean planes and engaged them. The North Korean aircraft split into two groups of four and quickly destroyed a Republic of Korea Air Force T-6 Texan parked on the tarmac at Kimpo.|$|E

5|$|The {{courses of}} the rivers Parrett, Somerset Axe, Brue and Cary {{run across the}} Somerset Levels and have {{generally}} been changed to improve the flow. The River Axe rises from Wookey Hole Caves, due to water draining into <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> swallet holes {{on top of the}} Mendips. The river passes through Panborough Moor, Wedmore Moor, Ox Moor, Stoke Moor and Mark Moor and reaches the sea at Uphill (near Weston-super-Mare) on Bridgwater Bay.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{voracious}} predators, eating most {{living things}} that are smaller than they are. Their staple diet is mostly bloodworms and other insect larvae, but they also feed on tadpoles and small fish. A few species, especially those that live in temporary waters, are likely to leave water. Nymphs of Cordulegaster bidentata sometimes hunt small arthropods on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> night.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> the place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was {{a black man in}} chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with four}} other {{scientists}} and various military personnel, von Neumann {{was included in the}} target selection committee responsible for choosing the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the first targets of the atomic bomb. Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect. The cultural capital Kyoto, which had been spared the bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities, was von Neumann's first choice, a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves. However, this target was dismissed by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} conservatism, in 1963 Brabham {{was the first}} Formula One team to use a wind tunnel to hone their designs to reduce drag and stop the cars lifting off <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> speed. The practice only became the norm in the early 1980s, and is possibly {{the most important factor}} in the design of modern cars. Towards the end of the 1960s, teams began to exploit aerodynamic downforce to push the cars' tyres down harder on the track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high-speed corners. At the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, Brabham were the first, alongside Ferrari, to introduce full width rear wings to this effect.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, RA85656, a Tupolev Tu-154 {{operating}} as Baikal Airlines Flight 130, crashed near Irkutsk shortly after departing from Irkutsk Airport, Russia. Damage to the starter caused {{a fire in}} engine number two (located in the rear fuselage). High temperatures during the fire destroyed the tanks and pipes of all three hydraulic systems. The crew {{lost control of the}} aircraft. The unmanageable plane, at a speed of 275 knots, hit <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> a dairy farm and burned. All passengers and crew, as well as a dairyman on the ground, died.|$|E

5|$|In late 842 or 843, with Neapolitan support, the Muslims conquered Messina. In 845, the {{fortress}} of Modica also fell, while the Byzantines, now {{at peace with}} the Abbasid Caliphate, received reinforcements from the eastern theme of Charsianon. The two armies met near Butera, where the Byzantines suffered a crushing defeat, losing about 10,000 men. In the wake of this disaster, the Byzantine position deteriorated rapidly: al-Fadl ibn Ja'far took Leontini by a ruse in 846, and {{the fortress}} of Ragusa followed in 848, when its garrison was forced by severe famine to surrender it to the Muslims, who razed it to <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>At</b> {{about the same time}} (late 847 or 848), an attempt by the Byzantine fleet to land troops near Palermo failed, and subsequently the Byzantines lost seven out of their ten ships in a storm.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 6 April, German aircraft caught the air reconnaissance assets of the 4th Army on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> Velika Gorica, destroying most of them. The continuing mobilisation and concentration of the 4th Army was hampered by escalating fifth column activities and propaganda fomented by the Ustaše. Some units stopped mobilising, or began returning to their mobilisation centres from their concentration areas. During the day, Yugoslav sabotage units attempted to destroy bridges over the Mura at Letenye, Mursko Središće and Kotoriba, and over the Drava at Gyékényes. These attempts were only partially successful, due {{to the influence of}} Ustaše propaganda and the countermanding of demolition orders by the {{chief of staff of the}} 27th Infantry Division Savska. The Yugoslav radio network in the 4th Army area was sabotaged by the Ustaše on 6 April, and radio communications within the 4th Army remained poor throughout the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus volemus, {{formerly}} known as Lactarius volemus, is a species of fungus in the family Russulaceae. It is widely distributed in the northern hemisphere, in temperate regions of Europe, North America and Asia {{as well as some}} subtropical and tropical regions of Central America and Asia. A mycorrhizal fungus, its fruit bodies grow on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> the base of various species of trees from summer to autumn, either individually or in groups. It is valued as an edible mushroom, and is sold in markets in Asia. Several other Lactifluus mushrooms resemble L.volemus, such as the closely related edible species L.corrugis, but these can be distinguished by differences in distribution, visible morphology, and microscopic characteristics. L.volemus produces a white spore print and has roughly spherical spores about 7–8micrometres in diameter.|$|E

5|$|Loring {{also had}} its share of {{incidents}} that did not result in fatalities over the years. On 6 March 1955, a B-36 Peacemaker crashed and burned in a snowbank at Loring. All crewmembers were able to escape unharmed. On 26 June 1958, a B-52D (55‑0102) burned on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> Loring and was destroyed. On 25 May 1969, a KC-135A (56–3602) broke in two after aborting takeoff. The cause was a frozen water injection surge tube. On 19 July 1970, a B-52G (58‑0208) also caught on fire and was destroyed on the ground.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April, B-17s {{from the}} 97th and 301st Bomb Groups bombed Sicilian airfields at Castelvetrano and Trapani. The Italians lost 11 SM.82s {{destroyed}} and 16 damaged on <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>At</b> Trapani the Germans lost eight aircraft and 40 damaged {{for the loss}} of two B-17s to the island's fighter defences consisting of Bf 109s from JG 27. Battles over the airfields in the afternoon were inconclusive, costing the Axis one Ju 88 from II./KG 26 and the Allies an RAF a Spitfire from No. 232 Squadron RAF. That night, air raids killed four German fighter pilots from I./JG 53 while two Ju 88s from II./NJG 2 and III./KG 76 were lost.|$|E
5|$|Other methods {{commonly}} practised in Europe included severing the tendons at {{the knees}} or placing poppy seeds, millet, or sand on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> the grave site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied all night by counting the fallen grains, indicating an association of vampires with arithmomania. Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampire-like being came across a sack of rice, {{it would have to}} count every grain; this is a theme encountered in myths from the Indian subcontinent, as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.|$|E

5|$|Several of Necrid's attacks {{duplicate}} physical {{motions and}} properties of attacks used by other {{characters in the}} series. However, each attack causes his weapon to extend from then retract into his hands, resulting in different visual cues than the move they derive from. Some attacks combine elements of two other existing character moves; for example, Dragon Blaze begins with one attack used by Maxi and ends with another from Nightmare. Despite this fact some moves are unique to Necrid's repertoire, such as Elder Topaz, an attack stance that allows {{the use of an}} altered set of attacks for a short time, and Void Cannon, which creates a small explosion on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> varying distances from Necrid.|$|E
5|$|The Spartan {{council of}} Elders, the gerousia, {{suggested}} that the Spartan women be sent to Crete for their protection. They were dissuaded from doing so by Arachidamia, the former queen and grandmother of the Eurypontid King Eudamidas II who convinced them that the women could assist in the city's defence. In order to guarantee the fighting men some rest, the women and the elderly began bolstering defences. Aware that Pyrrhus had elephants with him, the defenders dug a large trench and sunk wagons into <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>at</b> its flanks in order to hinder the Epiriote advance. Moreover, messengers were sent both to summon Areus back and to request aid from Antigonus, despite the fact the Sparta and Macedon had traditionally been hostile. Pausanias, the Greek geographer, claims that Sparta received some aid from Messene and the pro-Spartan faction at Argos.|$|E
5|$|The ZNDH's Dornier Do 17 medium bombers {{were still}} hitting back {{when and where}} they could.

On 10 February 1945, after a bridge-busting sortie on the Drava, a single ZNDH Dornier Do 17Z bombed the Partisans' 1. Zagorska Brigada (1st Zagorje Brigade) near Daruvar, inflicting two dozen casualties. Late in the afternoon of 30 March, four Dornier Do 17Z bombers, escorted by four Bf 109G fighters attacked the Partisans near Gospić. On 15 April 1945, a force {{made up of a}} Dornier Do 17Z, escorted by two Bf 109Gs destroyed two Partisan aircraft at their airfield in Sanski Most.|$|E
