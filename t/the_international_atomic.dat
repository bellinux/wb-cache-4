5|$|After {{returning}} to Earth, Van den Berg {{continued to work}} on crystal growth experiments at EG in California and he became the head for the section of materials science. At a later time he moved to Florida to become a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation. At age 72, he continued to work up to 40 hours a week and grow crystals, a process he compares to gardening. The crystals he grows (Mercuric Iodide crystals) are used to make precision detectors for nuclear radiation. These detectors are used in medical applications, by the defense industry and <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Agency.|$|E
5|$|Baxter succeeded Stevens as {{chairman}} in 1957. He worked part-time, spending Fridays at the AAEC until {{he retired from}} the UNSW in 1969. Thereafter he was full-time, until {{he retired from the}} AAEC on 15 April 1972. He was also the Australian member on the Board of Governors of <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Agency when it was created in 1957 and again from 1964 to 1972, serving as its chairman from 1969 to 1970.|$|E
5|$|The UN Charter {{stipulates}} that each primary {{organ of the}} United Nations can establish various specialized agencies to fulfil its duties. Some best-known agencies are <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN performs most of its humanitarian work through these agencies. Examples include mass vaccination programmes (through WHO), the avoidance of famine and malnutrition (through {{the work of the}} WFP), and the protection of vulnerable and displaced people (for example, by UNHCR).|$|E

5|$|Weinberg {{remained}} {{active in}} retirement. In 1992 {{he was named}} chairman of the International Friendship Bell Committee, which arranged for the installation of a Japanese bell in Oak Ridge. He also called for strengthening of <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Agency and systems to defend against nuclear weapons. His first wife, Margaret, died in 1969. He later married a stock broker, Genevieve DePersio, who died in 2004. His son David died in 2003. Weinberg died {{at his home in}} Oak Ridge on October 18, 2006. He was survived by his other son, Richard, and sister Fay Goleman.|$|E
5|$|Baxter was {{recruited}} by the then-New South Wales University of Technology {{as a professor of}} chemical engineering in 1949.

He served as chairman of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission from 1957 to 1972 and <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Agency from 1969 to 1970. He oversaw the construction of the High Flux Australian Reactor (HIFAR) at Lucas Heights. He also founded the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), and, as the chairman of the Sydney Opera House Trust, brought the Sydney Opera House to completion and opening on 20 October 1973.|$|E
5|$|In August 1922, Marie Curie {{became a}} member of the newly created International Commission for Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations. In 1923, she wrote a {{biography}} of Pierre, entitled Pierre Curie. In 1925, she visited Poland, to participate in the ceremony that laid foundations for the Radium Institute in Warsaw. Her second American tour, in 1929, succeeded in equipping the Warsaw Radium Institute with radium; it was opened in 1932 and her sister Bronisława became its director. These distractions from her scientific labours and the attendant publicity caused her much discomfort but provided resources needed for her work. In 1930, she was elected a member of <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Weights Committee where she served until her death.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, India has {{increased}} its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union. In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The 1972–73 {{debate over}} French nuclear {{testing in the}} Pacific mobilised several groups, {{including}} some trade unions. In 1972 the International Court of Justice in a case launched by Australia and New Zealand, and advocated by Dr Helen Caldicott, ordered that the French cease atmospheric nuclear testing at Mururoa atoll. In 1973 Australia's concerns {{saw it as a}} champion and an early adopter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and around this time, the Government ratified the Seabed Arms Control Treaty. Shortly after this, the Government negotiated with <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Agency to put in safeguards to ensure Australia could mine and export nuclear material but not breach the intent of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{agencies}} and individuals {{associated with the}} UN have won the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their work.

Lester B. Pearson, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing the UN's first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis. UNICEF won the prize in 1965, the International Labour Organization in 1969, the UN Peace-Keeping Forces in 1988, <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Agency (which reports to the UN) in 2005, and the UN-supported Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2013.
