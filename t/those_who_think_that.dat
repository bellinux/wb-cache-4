One of the examining pathologists, Thomas Bond, believed this to be a Ripper murder, though his colleague George Bagster Phillips, who had examined the bodies of three previous victims, disagreed. Later writers are also divided between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> her murderer copied the Ripper's modus operandi to deflect suspicion from himself, and those who ascribe it to the Ripper.|$|E

The organization has not revealed the cost of acquiring the sculptures, an amount {{not included in the}} $30 million; however, it is estimated that the collection is worth around $12 million, if not more. The garden has received criticism from <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> 24 sculptures is too many in such a small space.|$|E

25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} is also {{often seen as}} relying too heavily on complex mathematical models, such as those used in general equilibrium theory, without enough regard to whether these actually describe the real economy. Many see an attempt to model a system as complex as a modern economy by a mathematical model as unrealistic and doomed to failure. A famous answer to this criticism is Milton Friedman's claim that theories should be judged by their ability to predict events {{rather than by the}} realism of their assumptions. Mathematical models also include those in game theory, linear programming, and econometrics. Some see mathematical models used in contemporary research in mainstream economics as having transcended neoclassical economics, while others disagree. Critics of neoclassical economics are divided into <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> highly mathematical method is inherently wrong and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> mathematical method is potentially good even if contemporary methods have problems.|$|E

25|$|While mikoshi-nyūdō {{depicted}} as a yōkai with giant characteristics exists, the mikoshi-nyūdō that {{brings to mind the}} long-necked rokurokubi depicted in play images in the Edo period are certainly not strange. There are <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they are related to the rokurokubi, and since the rokurokubi of legends are frequently female, they are sometimes pointed out as examples of male rokurokubi.

500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{broadcast}} in the United States on NBC on Monday, September 21, 1998, in the 9:3010 p.m. (PST) timeslot. In its original American broadcast, the pilot tied with Working for forty-first place in {{ratings for the}} week of September 21–27, 1998. With a Nielsen rating of 8.6, equivalent to approximately 8.4 million viewing households, it was the fifteenth-highest-rated show on NBC the week it aired. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Joyce Millman of Salon Entertainment said the episode has [...] "glimmers of class" [...] and the jokes are [...] "relatively sophisticated". John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that Burrows's direction was [...] "sharp as usual" [...] and the writing was [...] "above average". Brian Lambert of the St. Paul Pioneer Press said the pilot was [...] "nicely staged by veteran director Jimmy Burrows, and coming from a couple producers, Max Mutchnick and David Cohan, who assisted Boston Common and Dream On, the show – {{which is to say}} the pilot episode (everything could go to hell next week) – has the best verbal interplay of any of the season's new sitcoms." [...] William Horn from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) thought the episode was a [...] "wonderful" [...] representation of a gay man's life [...] "regardless of whether he's in a relationship in that very moment. I think it's important that American audiences realize that lesbians and gay men are not simply all about sexual situations." [...] Ellen Gray of the Chicago Tribune was also positive about the show: [...] "For those who believe that Hollywood's engaging in a conspiracy to 'normalize' a sexual orientation that many Americans still find abhorrent, Will & Grace will look like a candy-coated poison pill. To <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Hollywood isn't moving fast enough in offering sexual parity for gays, it may just look like poison. But... there's a large audience out there that's somewhere in the mushy middle, an audience that might be ready to embrace Will & Grace." ...|$|E

2500|$|Philo saw in [...] {{accusations against}} [...] "the self-loving man." [...] Philo cited Cain {{as an example}} of one who (in [...] ) showed his {{gratitude}} to God too slowly. Philo taught that we should hurry to please God without delay. Thus [...] enjoins, [...] "If you vow a vow, you shall not delay to perform it." [...] Philo explained that a vow is a request to God for good things, and [...] thus enjoins that when one has received them, one must offer gratitude to God as soon as possible.

Philo taught that Scripture opposes all three. Philo wrote that [...] replies to the first group who forget, [...] "Take care, lest when you have eaten and are filled, and when you have built fine houses and inhabited them, and when your flocks and your herds have increased, and when your silver and gold, and all that you possess is multiplied, you be lifted up in your heart, and forget the Lord your God." [...] Philo taught that one does not forget God when one remembers one's own nothingness and God's exceeding greatness. Philo interpreted [...] to reprove those who look upon themselves as the cause of what they have received, telling them: [...] "Say not my own might, or the strength of my right hand has acquired me all this power, but remember always the Lord your God, who gives you the might to acquire power."

[...] Philo interpreted the term [...] "covenant" [...] figuratively to mean God's graces. Thus Philo concluded that if we discard forgetfulness, ingratitude, and self-love, we will no longer through delay miss attaining the genuine worship of God, but we shall meet God, having prepared ourselves to do what God commands us.|$|E

60|$|Turgot {{was one of}} the men to whom good {{government}} is a religion. It might be said to be the religion of all the best men of that century, and it was natural that it should be so. The decay of a theology that places our deepest solicitudes in a sphere beyond this, is naturally accompanied by a transfer of these high solicitudes to a nearer scene. But though the desire for {{good government}}, and a right sense of its cardinal importance, were common ideas of the time in all the best heads from Voltaire downwards, yet Turgot had a patience which in them was universally wanting. There are two sorts of mistaken people in the world: <b>those</b> <b>who</b> always <b>think</b> <b>that</b> something could and ought to have been done to prevent disaster, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> always <b>think</b> <b>that</b> nothing could have been done. Turgot was very far removed indeed from the latter class, but, on the other side, he was too sagacious not to know that there are some evils of which we do well to bear a part, as the best means of mitigating the other part. Though he respected the writings of Rousseau and confessed his obligations to them, Turgot abhorred declamation. He had no hope of clearing society of the intellectual and moral débris of ages at a stroke. Nor had he abstract standards of human bliss. The keyword to his political theory was not Pity nor Benevolence, but Justice. 'We are sure to go wrong,' he said once, when pressed to confer some advantage on the poor at the cost of the rich, 'the moment we forget that justice alone can keep the balance true among all rights and all interests.' Let us proceed to watch this principle actively applied in a field where it was grievously needed.|$|R
30|$|Of course, {{there may}} be other {{variables}} shaping views of what roles the state should undertake, and therefore we control for them.

We expect <b>those</b> individuals <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> their governments are efficacious to support a more active role for the state in the economy, all things being equal. We also control for level of interest in politics (interest), because if, as we argue, trans-border conversations impact opinions {{about the role of the}} state in any meaningful way, overall levels of political interest appear as a relevant intervening variable we need to control for. Higher values of this variable indicate less interest in politics.|$|R
