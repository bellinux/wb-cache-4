40|$|A {{single-stage}} current-fed DC-DC converter module {{capable of}} step-up and step-down operation is described. It employs <b>time-sharing</b> <b>control</b> of output voltage and input current, allowing fast and stable response {{even in the}} case of heavy supply and load variations. Design and implementation criteria are discussed on the basis of theoretical results and experimental data. A converter prototype was built, featuring high power density, good efficiency, hardware simplicity, and fast and accurate control. The proposed solution is currently applied in radar for aerospace, where compactness, reliability, and control performance are prime requirements...|$|R
5000|$|Some MPT 1327 {{networks}} {{can also}} <b>time-share</b> <b>control</b> channels, {{which can be}} useful if the network has limited frequency availability, as it frees up channels for use as traffic channels, which can also be pooled across sites so the network capacity follows the traffic. This is another advantage of MPT 1327 (and dPMR) over TDMA-based systems such as TETRA and DMR, which cannot pool traffic channels so efficiently (if at all). The disadvantage of using a time-shared CCH is that it slows down registration and calls and requires some customization of the registration process, so is only useful if the network has a patient user community! ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{user-interface}} and distributed imaging system for controlling robotic web-cameras via a wireless cellular phone. A user scrolls an image canvas {{to select a}} new live picture. The cellular phone application (a Java MIDlet) sends a URL request, which encodes the new pan/tilt/optical-zoom of a live picture, to a web-camera server. The user downloads a new live picture centered on the user's new viewpoint. The web-camera server mediates requests from users, by <b>time-sharing</b> <b>control</b> of the physical robotic hardware. By processing a queue of user requests at different pan/tilt/zoom locations, the server can capture a single photograph for each user. While one user downloads a new live image, the robotic camera moves to capture images and service other independent user requests. The end-toend system enables each user to independently steer the robotic camera, viewing live snapshot pictures from a cellular phone...|$|R
40|$|Obtaining {{simultaneous}} {{and timely}} access to multiple resources {{is known to}} be an NP-complete problem [10]. Complete resource decoupling is, therefore, often used for managing end-to-end delays in distributed real-time systems where each processor is scheduled independent of the others. This decoupling approach unfortunately fails when multiple resources must be managed within a single node. Resources such as disk bandwidth and network bandwidth are available on a single node but must be managed by their host processor by means of device drivers, filesystem or protocol services. The host processor acting as a controlling resource, therefore, must play multiple roles. One, it is used by applications on that node. Two, it is used to control and manage other (<b>time-shared)</b> <b>controlled</b> resources including disk bandwidth and network bandwidth. These two roles, unfortunately, can often be at odds with one another. In this paper, we investigate the problem of co-scheduling controlling a [...] ...|$|R

40|$|LLM (Estate Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Rapid {{growth of}} cities {{has become a}} trend in most countries, this is caused by {{urbanisation}} wherein people move from the rural areas to the urban areas in search of employment. It {{goes without saying that}} such population needs housing. However, it is unusual to find land for housing in an already crowded place. Therefore, to curb this shortage in housing, countries like South Africa have resorted to adoption of fragmented property holding in and around the cities. Thus, in an attempt to curtail housing shortages in the urban area as well as land shortage, communal property schemes were adopted together with their governing legislation namely, Sectional Titles Act 95 of 1986, Share Blocks Act 59 of 1980 and Property <b>Time-sharing</b> <b>Control</b> Act 75 of 1983 to name a few. Likewise, Maseru, the capital city of Lesotho is also experiencing rapid growth in population. Hence, with the introduction of Lesotho’s Sectional Titles Bill 2013 came a ray of hope that the land and housing shortage in Maseru would be addressed. With this in mind, this suggested that the Government of Lesotho together with all concerned stakeholders thought it necessary to address this problem through the 2013 Bill which, for the most part follows the South African Sectional Titles Act of 1986. It {{is for this reason that}} this study was embarked on to show other forms of property holding akin to sectional titles as well as their regulation, which can all be used to eliminate housing shortages in Lesotho.

40|$|Abstract — For most {{wireless}} {{services with}} variable rate transmission, both average rate and rate oscillation are important performance metrics. The traditional performance criterion, utility of average transmission rate, boosts {{the average rate}} but also results in high rate oscillations. We introduce a utility function of instantaneous transmission rates. It is capable of facilitating the resource allocation with flexible combinations of average rate and rate oscillation. Based on the new utility, we consider the time and power allocation in a time-shared wireless network. Two adaptation policies are developed, namely, time sharing (TS) and joint time sharing and power control (JTPC). An extension to quantized time sharing with limited channel feedback (QTSL) for practical systems is also discussed. Simulation results show that by controlling the concavity of the utility function, a tradeoff between the average rate and rate oscillation can be easily made.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the first {{experiment}} of a series studying the effect of task structure and difficulty demand on time-sharing performance and workload in both automated and corresponding manual systems. The experimental task involves manual <b>control</b> <b>time-shared</b> with spatial and verbal decisions tasks of two levels of difficulty and two modes of response (voice or manual). The results provide strong evidence that tasks and processes competing for common processing resources are time shared less effecively and have higher workload than tasks competing for separate resources. Subjective measures {{and the structure of}} multiple resources are used in conjunction to predict dual task performance. The evidence comes from both single-task and from dual-task performance...|$|R
