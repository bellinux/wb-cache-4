5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> director, Newt was {{the most}} {{difficult}} role to cast: Schoolchildren were auditioned, but many of them had acted in commercials and were accustomed to smiling after saying their lines. Henn, from Atwater, California was chosen out of 500 children for the role, although she had no previous acting experience. She received a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor, but chose not to pursue an acting career, and became a teacher.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} the {{reaction}} of the crew <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> of Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), and the subsequent changes made to The Girlie Show.

Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) struggles to keep the cast and crew happy, so together with Tracy, she throws a party on a yacht.|$|E
25|$|Matrices {{released}} from the magazine, and spacebands {{released from}} the spaceband box, drop down into the assembler. This is a rail that holds the matrices and spacebands, with a jaw on the left end set to the desired line width. When the operator judges that the line is close enough to full, he raises the casting lever {{on the bottom of}} the keyboard to send the line <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> section of the linotype machine. The remaining processing for that line is automatic; as soon as the finished line has been transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> section, the operator can begin composing the next line of text.|$|E

25|$|The casting {{of a new}} Doctor {{has often}} {{inspired}} debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's sex (prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors to date have been white) and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, Burt Reynolds and Mick Jagger were {{considered}} to portray Fletch but these suggestions were rejected by Mcdonald. The author agreed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> of Chevy Chase despite never seeing the comedian in anything.

In a 2004 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Chase confirmed this was his favorite role.|$|E
5000|$|With Dunn and Lovitz gone, Michaels {{was put in}} {{an awkward}} situation. Most of <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> {{had been on the}} show for five seasons. He {{did not want to be}} put in the spot of having <b>to</b> replace <b>the</b> entire <b>cast</b> all at once.

The majority of foundry units in Rajkot produce grey iron castings for the domestic market. About 2% of the foundry units export castings such as electric motor castings and automobile castings.|$|E
25|$|Berlin {{returned}} to Tin Pan Alley {{after the war}} and in 1921 created a partnership with Sam Harris to build the Music Box Theater.

In its early years, the theater was a showcase for revues by Berlin. As theater owner, producer and composer, he looked after every detail of his shows, from the costumes and sets <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> and musical arrangements.|$|E
25|$|In 1937 Professor J.B. Whelehan, {{the then}} Chief Scout, {{together}} with the National Executive Board of CBSI (later Scouting Ireland (CSI)), decided to purchase a campsite. Many venues were suggested, but eventually two options remained. One was Santry Demesne, part of which is now the Morton Stadium for athletics, near Dublin Airport, {{and the other was}} Larch Hill. The decision fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> vote of Prof. Whelehan, whose foresight saw that the Santry site would become part of the city far more quickly than its south-side counterpart.|$|E

25|$|Foster's {{career began}} with an {{appearance}} as the Coppertone girl in a television advertisement in 1965, {{when she was only}} three years old. Her mother had originally intended only for her older brother Buddy to audition for the ad, but had taken Jodie with them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> call, where she was noticed by the casting agents. The television spot led to more advertisement work, and in 1968 to a minor appearance in the sitcom Mayberry R.F.D., in which her brother starred. In the following years Foster continued working in advertisements and appeared in over fifty television shows; she and her brother became the breadwinners of the family during this time. Although most of Foster's television appearances were minor, she had recurring roles in The Courtship of Eddie's Father (1969–1971) and Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1973), and starred opposite Christopher Connelly in the short-lived Paper Moon (1974), adapted from the hit film.|$|E
500|$|Wilford Brimley {{was cast}} {{at the urging}} of his good friend Duvall, who was not getting along well with Beresford and wanted [...] "{{somebody}} down here that's on my side, somebody that I can relate to".

500|$|Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, Harry's other {{best friend}} and the trio's brains. Watson's Oxford theatre teacher passed her name on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> agents {{and she had to}} do over five {{interviews}} before she got the part. Watson took her audition seriously, but [...] "never really thought [...] had any chance of getting the role." [...] The producers were impressed by Watson's self-confidence and she outperformed the thousands of other girls who had applied.|$|E

Cox was asked to audition with his back turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> agents, as they felt they needed {{to focus on the}} power of his voice when considering him for the part.|$|E
500|$|Frank Scheck, of The Hollywood Reporter, {{rated the}} film as poor, saying the film is [...] "more {{suitable}} for late night cable viewing" [...] than a theatrical release. He went on to criticize Uekrongtham's directing, saying that [...] " [...] clearly [...] paid more attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> than the onscreen mechanics. And for a film so seemingly interested in educating audiences about the evils of sex trafficking", Scheck pointed out, Uekrongtham {{had no problem with}} [...] "including copious doses of female nudity".|$|E
500|$|Several {{concepts}} and items of imagery {{have been used}} in Biblical comparisons.

Martha Kent states, [...] "All these years how we've prayed and prayed that the good Lord would see fit to give us a child," [...] which was compared to the Virgin Mary.|$|E

500|$|This {{led to the}} {{introduction}} of Klea Scott as Emma Hollis. Originally, the producers were looking for a white actress to play the part. Scott's agent campaigned for her and guaranteed the series' producers that if she was not considered for the role, he would never send another actor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> director of the show. Scott won the role, but producer Chip Johannessen recalled that [...] "she wasn't what the network were looking, they wanted Heather Locklear or something to come. That was kind of how that went down." [...] Fox backed down, and Scott got the role.|$|E

British actress Gemma Chan also auditioned for the part.|$|E
500|$|Greek actress Katina Paxinou was {{originally}} {{considered for the}} role of Rosa Klebb, but was unavailable. Terence Young cast Austrian singer Lotte Lenya after hearing one of her musical recordings. Young wanted Kronsteen's portrayer to be [...] "an actor with a remarkable face", so the minor character would be well remembered by audiences. This led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> of Vladek Sheybal, whom Young also considered convincing as an intellectual. Several women were tested for the roles of Vida and Zora, the two fighting Gypsy girls, and after Aliza Gur and Martine Beswick were cast, they spent six weeks practising their fight choreography with stunt work arranger Peter Perkins.|$|E
