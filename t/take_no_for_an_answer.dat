25|$|Sam {{returns in}} 1995, after her brothers, on a boys holiday in Spain, catch her {{in bed with}} David Wicks (Michael French), and force her to return. Sam had tried to build herself {{a career as a}} model, but it had not gone to plan and she had ended up working as a hostess in a bar. Back in Walford Sam tries to {{continue}} her fling with David and when this goes nowhere she tries to come between Ricky and his girlfriend, Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). Initially Ricky thinks he still has feelings for Sam, but eventually realises he is better off with Bianca and tries to let Sam down gently. However Sam won't <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> and purposefully kisses an innocent Ricky in front of Bianca, causing them to split. Despite this, Ricky will not reconsider getting back with Sam and opts to try to make amends with Bianca. Sam is forced to admit defeat. Soon after, she meets a Spanish man named Guillermo, who is holidaying in England. When he invites her to join him in Spain she leaps at the chance and leaves Walford again in March 1996.|$|E
500|$|The {{office workers}} {{are forced to}} use the stairs while the {{elevator}} is being serviced, a situation everyone deems [...] "Stairmageddon". A badly out-of-shape Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) undergoes a painful struggle in climbing the stairs, only to be greeted at the top by Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) ordering him {{to take part in}} an important sales call. Unwilling to climb the stairs a second time, Stanley refuses. Since the client is a friend of Stanley, Dwight (who is operating without concern for niceties now that the documentary has driven home the point that he will never be the branch manager at Dunder Mifflin) cannot <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> so he shoots Stanley with bull tranquilizers. With help from Clark Green (Clark Duke), Dwight gets Stanley to the car. The tranquilizers inexplicably make Stanley intoxicated, and his unusually jolly mood helps them close the sale. When Stanley regains full awareness, he is pleased to learn that he made a sale with no effort whatsoever, but still refuses to take the stairs again. He instead knocks himself out with one of Dwight's darts, leaving Dwight and Clark {{to figure out how to}} get him back upstairs.|$|E

The track, which lasts for a duration of , is a [...] "smoky, sultry" [...] song. It features an [...] "old-school hip-hop loop" [...] and vocal samples, as well as [...] "dirty bass" [...] which creates an [...] "underground" [...] feel. On [...] "Red Hot Kinda Love", Aguilera keeps her use of melisma to a minimum which allows for a [...] "relaxed and playful" [...] vocal performance. Lyrically, the song talks about Aguilera's attempts to impress the man she is flirting with. She has [...] "fallen hook, line and sinker for him" [...] and will not <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> Chris Younie for 4Music wrote that his favorite lyric in the song is [...] "Baby I'm burning up, you got that red hot kinda love", which the song's hook is built around. According to Sal Cinquemani for Slant Magazine, it features [...] "a catchy pre-chorus, and an even catchier chorus." [...] Andrew Hampp for Billboard compared the song's structure to those performed by Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue which they have [...] "specialized in for years." ...|$|E

500|$|Favreau {{planned to}} cast a {{newcomer}} in the title role, as [...] "those movies don't require an expensive star; Iron Man's the star, the superhero is the star. The success of X-Men and Spider-Man without being star-driven pieces reassures [...] that the film does have an upside commercially." [...] However, in September 2006, Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the role. Favreau chose Downey, {{a fan of the}} comic, because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part, explaining [...] "The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark." [...] Favreau faced opposition from Marvel in casting Downey, but would not <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> saying, [...] "It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ... everybody knew he was talented [...] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert in all the good and bad ways. While preparing for filming, Favreau and Downey were given a tour of SpaceX by Elon Musk. Downey said, [...] "Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with, or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans." ...|$|E

It was impossible that Allan could respect the confidence which Mrs. Milroy had treacherously affected to place in him. But he had an honest man's regard for his own pledged word--the regard which looks straightforward at the fact, and which never glances sidelong at the circumstances--and the utmost persistency of Pedgift Senior failed to move him a hairbreadth from the position which he had taken up.

60|$|Cynthia was deprived, too, of that thrilling first view of {{the capital}} from the train which she had pictured, for night had fallen when they reached Washington likewise. As the train slowed down, she leaned {{a little out of}} the window and looked at the shabby houses and shabby streets {{revealed}} by the flickering lights in the lamp-posts. Finally they came to a shabby station, were seized upon by a grinning darky hackman, who would not <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> and were rattled away to the hotel.

How many young men have I seen here, admirably dressed--rich, you would say. No, no. The mont-de-piete permits no secrets. To swank, mademoiselle, what is it? To deceive the world, yes.

60|$|For Farrar's sake, if the Celebrity {{had been}} content {{with women in}} general, all would have been well; but {{he was unable to}} generalize, in one sense, and to particularize, in another. And it was plain that he wished to monopolize Miss Trevor, while still {{retaining}} a hold upon the others. For my sake, had he been content with women alone, I should have had no cause to complain. But it seemed that I had an attraction for him, second only to women, which I could not account for. And I began to be cursed {{with a great deal of}} his company. Since he was absolutely impervious to hints, and would not <b>take</b> <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> I was helpless. When he had no engagement he would thrust himself on me. He seemed to know by intuition--for I am very sure I never told him--what my amusement was to be the mornings I did not go to the county-seat, and he would invariably turn up, properly equipped, as I was making my way with judge Short to the tennis court, or carrying my oars to the water. It was in vain that I resorted to subterfuge: that I went to bed early intending to be away before the Celebrity's rising hour. I found he had no particular rising hour. No matter how early I came down, I would find him on the veranda, smoking cigarettes, or otherwise his man would be there with a message to say that his master would shortly join me if I would kindly wait. And at last I began to realize in my harassed soul that all elusion was futile, and to take such holidays as I could get, when he was off with a girl, in a spirit of thankfulness.|$|E

Spoke clearly, sensibly, and modestly, and was never too long. Held the House, where men of higher abilities [...] "bored" [...] it. The chiefs of his party said openly, [...] "We must do something for Delamayn," [...] The opportunity offered, and the chiefs kept their word. Their Solicitor-General was advanced a step, and they put Delamayn in his place. There was an outcry {{on the part of the}} older members of the Bar. The Ministry answered, [...] "We want a man who is listened to in the House, and we have got him." [...] The papers supported the new nomination. A great debate came off, and the new Solicitor-General justified the Ministry and the papers. His enemies said, derisively, [...] "He will be Lord Chancellor in a year or two!" [...] His friends made genial jokes in his domestic circle, which pointed to the same conclusion. They warned his two sons, Julius and Geoffrey (then at college), to be careful what acquaintances they made, as they might find themselves the sons of a lord at a moment's notice. It really began to look like something of the sort. Always rising, Mr. Delamayn rose next to be Attorney-General. About the same time--so true it is that [...] "nothing succeeds like success"--a childless relative died and left him a fortune. In the summer of 'sixty-six a Chief Judgeship fell vacant. The Ministry had made a previous appointment which had been universally unpopular. They saw their way to supplying the place of their Attorney-General, and they offered the judicial appointment to Mr. Delamayn. He preferred remaining in the House of Commons, and refused to accept it. The Ministry declined to <b>take</b> <b>No</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> They whispered confidentially, [...] "Will you take it with a peerage?" [...] Mr. Delamayn consulted his wife, and took it with a peerage. The London Gazette announced him to the world as Baron Holchester of Holchester.
