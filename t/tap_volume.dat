50|$|Michael Kelly Guitars is an American guitar, {{bass and}} {{mandolin}} company, who imports high quality instruments manufactured to their specifications (mainly from S. Korea). Based in Clearwater, Florida, {{they are a}} division of Guruz Media Inc, also based in Clearwater, Florida. Michael Kelly Guitars was founded in 1999. The company has recently gained popularity, particularly due {{to the release of}} their new Mod Shop Guitars, where they take some of their standard designs and swap out the pickups using Lindy Fralin, Seymour Duncan, TV Jones, Bare Knuckle and Fishman. They are also hot rodding the wiring, and adding coil <b>tap</b> <b>volume</b> and tone pots to some of the Mod Shop Designs. They have also gained popularity due to their Dragonfly II acoustic bass, which has been used by Duff McKagan of Guns N' Roses, Shavo Odadjian of System of a Down, Tony Bigley of Souls Harbor, and others #see http://www.michaelkellyguitars.com/artists.html for a full list#.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{precursor}} of LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4 cathode material with high density was synthesized by two-dryness co-precipitation method. The optimized parameters were found out {{by studying the}} relationship between the density of precursor and the concentration of reactants, the manner of adding agglomerating agent, the remaining water in filter cake and the manner of dryness. The highest density (1. 74 g/cm 3) of precursor can be achieved under optimized condition: NiSO 4 0. 375 mol/L, coagulation agent added with little amount but many times, 28 % of water in filter cake and two-step dryness, which is much better than that made by other methods. Our experiment provides a significant reference for the synthesis of excellent-performance cathode materials of lithium-ion battery. LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4 has a good cycle performance, a higher discharge capacity and a discharge platform of 4. 7 v, so it has become a research focus of 5 -voltage cathode materials in the field of lithium ion battery recently. [1 - 4] However, LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4 prepared by common methods usually has a lower <b>tap</b> <b>volume</b> capacity.

Satriani has mastered many performance techniques on electric guitar, including legato, two-handed tapping and arpeggio <b>tapping,</b> <b>volume</b> swells, harmonics and extreme whammy bar effects. During fast passages, Satriani favors a legato technique (achieved primarily through hammer-ons and pull-offs) that yields smooth and flowing runs. He is also adept at other speed-related techniques such as rapid alternate picking and sweep picking. Satriani was influenced by blues-rock guitar icons such as Jimi Hendrix, Brian May, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore and Jeff Beck, as well as jazz fusion guitarist Allan Holdsworth.|$|R

40|$|Casting, cooling and crushing/sieving of ferroalloys has {{followed}} a well-established {{pattern in the}} whole ferroalloys industry for many years. Usually liquid metal or alloys are cast into flat open moulds of various shapes and forms, and after solidification the product is removed from such mould to further cool down to a temperature where subsequent handling steps are feasible. Common to all mechanical product fractioning is the generation of dust and fine size material with lower product value. For almost 10 years, Bécancour Silicon has investigated alternative roads to improve technology and/or reduce or solve problems related to those disadvantages. Since 1995 Bécancour Silicon operates a special silicon granulation plant targeted to product for the chemical treatment/conversion of silicon for silicones production. Prior {{to the development of}} the granulation process, various systems had been evaluated, among others the vibrating casting bed, now in operation elsewhere but judged inappropriate because of the <b>tapping</b> <b>volumes</b> to be handled at Bécancour Silicon and other disadvantages.

Here, using a well-defined macroscopic protocol, we prepare an ensemble of granular systems and track the statistics of volume changes {{as a function}} of the number of taps. This is in contrast to previous studies, which have focused on single trajectories and assumed ergodicity. We devise a new method to assess the convergence properties of a sequence of ensemble volume histograms and introduce a reasonable approximate version of an invariant histogram. We then compare these invariant histograms with histograms generated by sampling a long trajectory for one system and observe nonergodicity, which we quantify. Finally, we use the overlapping histogram method to assess potential compatibility with Edwards' canonical assumption. Our histograms are incompatible with this assumption.

40|$|Simple, reliable, and {{efficient}} concentration of poliovirus from tap water was obtained with {{two types of}} electropositive filter media, {{one of which is}} available {{in the form of a}} pleated cartridge filter (Virozorb 1 MDS). Virus adsorption from tap water between pH 3. 5 and 7. 5 was more efficient with electropositive filters than with Filterite filters. Elution of adsorbed viruses was more efficient with beef extract in glycine, pH 9. 5, than with glycine-NaOH, pH 11. 0. In paired comparative studies, electropositive filters, with adsorption at pH 7. 5 and no added polyvalent cation salts, gave less variable virus concentration efficiencies than did Filterite filters with adsorption at pH 3. 5 plus added MgCl 2. Recovery of poliovirus from 1, 000 -liter <b>tap</b> water <b>volumes</b> was approximately 30 % efficient with both Virozorb 1 MDS and Filterite pleated cartridge filters, but the former were much simpler to use.

40|$|The {{combination}} of parametric values and appropriate sampling methods {{is essential for}} compliance checking, for estimating our exposure and for evaluating the protection level of the European Tap Water Directive. At present the Directive does not prescribe a sampling method. Products used in the domestic distribution system can be major contributors deteriorating the quality of tap water with chemical substances compared to products used in the distribution network. This is due to stagnation. Sample volume and stagnation time are the main parameters that determine the concentration of substances migrating from materials in the domestic distribution at the consumers¿ tap. These two parameters need to be selected in such way that they give a good estimate of our exposure. Our results show a strong dependence between the observed concentration of several metals at the <b>tap</b> and sample <b>volume</b> and stagnation time. Very few similar data are available and data on consumption behaviour are difficult to find. Increased monitoring of concentrations and consumption seems to be needed {{to get a better}} view on our exposure to contaminants in drinking water released by products used for domestic distribution at European level. All this information could be collected in a database on exposure to drinking water. It may link existing databases in member states and should be regularly updated to follow life-style changes. JRC.

40|$|Regeneration {{technologies}} such as androgenesis, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and nuclear transfer require that handling conditions do not alter oocyte ability to sustain embryo development. One important parameter in the maintenance of oocyte quality in fish is the possibility to prevent oocytes activation during manipulation. In Cyprinid, such activation {{is known to be}} delayed when Salmonid coelomic fluid is used as incubation medium. Coelomic fluid however is a biological fluid whose ability to sustain oocyte quality during in vitro incubation may be variable. The purpose of the present work was to explore this variability using Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) coelomic fluid (TCF) and Goldfish (Carassius auratus) oocytes, and to set up a test which would reflect TCF suitability for Goldfish oocyte incubation. We showed that different TCF induced very different development rates after oocyte incubation for 30 min at 20 degrees C: at 24 h post fertilization (pf) and at hatching, rates ranged between 35 % and 110 % of the non-incubated controls. When TCF (1 volume) was mixed with <b>tap</b> water (9 <b>volumes),</b> a precipitate developed whose extent was measured by spectrophotometry. This turbidity test proved to be highly correlated to development rates after Goldfish oocyte incubation in TCF (r(2) = 0. 83 at hatching, n = 150) : TCF with the highest turbidity (> 1. 5 absorbance unit at 400 nm) were the ones which altered the most the development rates after incubation (less than 50 % at hatching). This easy and rapid turbidity test can therefore be used as a reliable estimator of TCF suitability for Goldfish oocyte incubation and manipulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is a laser based Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF process which uses laser energy to melt {{a thin layer of}} metal powder. This process is repeated to produce a 3 -dimensional metallic part. SLM is capable of producing intricate parts which are otherwise difficult to produce with conventional manufacturing techniques. As compared to traditional manufacturing processes, SLM can also produce parts with higher density. Before a material is processed using SLM, suitable processing parameters are first identified. Over the years, different materials have been processed using the SLM process. However, very little work has been done on SLM of bio-compatible precious metals such as gold and its alloys. Gold and its alloys have been used for manufacturing of dental crowns for centuries. The SLM process could be used to produce intricate metallic substructures for porcelain fused to metal dental restorations. This research work was focused on understanding the processing parameters for SLM of 24 carat gold powder. The gold powder was analyzed for Particle Size Distribution (PSD), apparent density and tap density before identifying suitable processing parameters for SLM. The gold powder particles were found to be spherical in nature but smaller particles stuck to each other and formed larger powder agglomerates. From the apparentdensity experiments, the gold powder was found to be cohesive and non-flowing in nature which hindered powder flowability during the powder deposition process with the existing system. This issue was resolved by designing a new powder deposition system which could allow the gold powder to flow evenly over the substrate. The tap density of the gold powder was found by Constant Weight Tap Density (CWTD) and Constant <b>Volume</b> <b>Tap</b> Density (CVTD) techniques. The difference in results from these two techniques was negligible. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of gold powder showed it to be more than twice as reflective as other commonly processed metal powders such as stainless steel and H 13 tool steel. This analysis proved useful in understanding the laser processing of gold powder. Due to the high cost and small quantity of material available for this work, a very small build platform was designed to optimise material utilisation and reduce wastage. Single scans were performed on a single layer of gold powder to identify the good melting region. Five different regions i. e. balling, good melting, unstable melt, weak sintering and very little sintering were observed in the processing window. The balling phenomenon was observed at low and high scan speeds, which was due to the melt pool instability at these parameter settings. The size of droplets (balling) also increased with decreasing scan speed and increasing laser power which was due to an increase in the break up time of the molten metal. In the good melting region, the gold powder was found to be completely melted and continuous beads were successfully produced. The unstable melt region showed the melt pool spreading unevenly in different directions whereas in the weak sintering and very little sintering regions the gold powder did not melt completely. Single layers were produced on a layer of gold powder, which showed the parameters in the good melting regions to be suitable for multiple layer parts manufacturing. Gold cubes were produced using the suitable processing parameters identified from single scan and single layer experiments and then analyzed for their internal porosity. The porosity in the gold cubes was found to be at a minimum for parameters obtained in the good melting region. The internal porosity was found to be mostly inter-layer porosity; this indicated less heat transferred to the region between the two layers which could be associated with the high reflectivity of gold. The inter-layer porosity in gold cubes was further reduced by reducing the layer thickness. This could be due to the thinner layers requiring less energy to melt and be fused to the previous layers. The hatch distance had a negligible effect on the inter-layer porosity of gold cubes. The reduction in hatch distance increased the energy delivered but it was still not enough to completely melt the gold powder and fuse it to the previous layer. A pre-scan technique was also tested to be used for pre-heating the powder bed. However, due to the rapid drop in temperature, this technique was not found suitable {{to be used as a}} powder bed pre-heating technique. The gold cubes were checked for their mechanical properties i. e. hardness and modulus. The hardness of gold cubes was found to be higher than expected for 24 carat gold. The modulus was found to be less than 24 carat gold. This variation in the mechanical properties of gold cubes could be due to the rapid heating and cooling of material during the laser processing or presence of internal porosity in these gold cubes. After single scans and single layers manufacturing, gold dental parts (premolar and molar) were also manufactured using the optimum processing parameters. These gold dental parts were also analyzed for their internal porosity, which was found to be less than that observed in gold cubes.
