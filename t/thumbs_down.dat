25|$|There {{are a few}} {{different}} methods of advertising on Pandora. Audio advertising comes in spots of 15 to 30 seconds, and run once every 20 minutes. However, users only encounter ads if they are engaging with the site, like contributing a thumbs up or a <b>thumbs</b> <b>down</b> when changing a song or station.|$|E
25|$|A {{station is}} set by specifying an artist or song, or a {{combination}} of multiple items of any kind in a single station. Listeners can tune into established genre stations, other users' stations or create their own stations based on their musical interests. Each track played can be responded to with favorable (thumbs up) or unfavorable (<b>thumbs</b> <b>down)</b> buttons, which determine if it should be played, and if similarly classified songs should be played in the station. A second negative response to the same artist will ban that artist from the selected station unless the user has marked the artist positively on another occasion or if that artist is listed under the station's variety. No response is applicable to musical attributes or to albums. An unfavorable response immediately stops play of the track. Clicking the <b>thumbs</b> <b>down</b> or skipping to the next song too many times in a row will result in a short ban of skips. Pandora also utilizes short advertisements between every couple of songs.|$|E

At Unforgiven, Triple H beat Orton to regain the World Heavyweight Championship, with help from Flair, Batista, and Jonathan Coachman.

MacKenzie introduced features such as nightly editions of 'Topless Darts' (featuring topless women playing darts on a beach), 'The Weather in Norwegian' (with a young, typically blonde and bikini-clad Scandinavian woman presenting weather forecasts in both English and Norwegian), other weather forecasts featuring dwarfs bouncing on trampolines and stock exchange reports presented by Tiffany, a young female presenter who would strip to her underwear as she read out the latest share prices. A large amount of airtime was given over to tarot card readers and astrologers.

Jonathan Miller's 1982 version of Rigoletto for English National Opera, {{set in the}} world of modern American mafiosi, received critical plaudits.

Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert both gave the film mixed reviews, but with the former giving it a thumbs up and the latter a <b>thumbs</b> <b>down.</b> In his written review, Ebert wrote: [...] "Is the movie better entertainment? Well, it's great bubblegum for the eyes. Younger children will be able to process it more easily; some kids were led bawling from Batman Returns where the PG-13 rating was a joke." [...] Mick LaSalle had a mixed reaction, concluding [...] "a shot of Kilmer's rubber buns at one point is guaranteed to bring squeals from the audience." ...|$|E

[...] Soap Opera Digest gave the storyline a thumbs up and a <b>thumbs</b> <b>down</b> because, though it was an exciting twist, it happened too closely to the other Chancellor family rewrite undoing the mother and daughter relationship between Jill and Katherine. The magazine later named the storyline the [...] "Most Preposterous Plot Twist" [...] of 2009 because the rewrite [...] "was way {{out of sync with}} Ys usual authentic approach to storytelling". In 2011, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News said that Goddard is [...] "forever second guessing his character when asked about Cane by the media", also stating that, [...] "To keep an edgy Cane, never to make him boring and lifeless. That’s why Cane is forever keeping secrets from his wife Lily and step mom Jill." [...] Garrett added that he was [...] "interested to see what Maria Bell's plan is" [...] to keep the character edgy, and that Goddard's performance is [...] "always dependable, on fire and exciting".

500|$|Hard Target {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} on its initial release praising the film's action scenes but noting the poor story and Jean-Claude Van Damme's acting abilities. On the film review television show Siskel & Ebert, Roger Ebert stated that Hard Target is [...] "not very smart and it's not very original, {{but it is}} well made on a technical level. The stunts are impressive... as an action picture, it's well made, but it never becomes more than competent action and I just can't recommend it for that". Gene Siskel also gave the film a <b>thumbs</b> <b>down</b> on the show stating that [...] "John Woo is a good filmmaker... Van Damme is pretty wooden... You notice the style in the film because {{there is not much}} substance". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Van Damme has still not broken the habit of his own blank-faced posturing, although Mr. Woo films him in the most aggrandizing style imaginable". In Variety, Emanuel Levy wrote that Hard Target was [...] "a briskly vigorous, occasionally brilliant actioner starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. However, hampered by a B-script with flat, standard characters, and subjected to repeated editing of the violent sequences to win an R rating, pic doesn't bear the unique vision on display in Woo's recent [...] "The Killer" [...] and [...] "Hard-Boiled." [...] Van Damme and the director's reputation should ensure initial commercial kick on the way to solid if not spectacular box office". Desson Thompson of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "When Van Damme isn't duking it out with the English language, scriptwriter Chuck Pfarrer is filling Henriksen's mouth with villainous pseudo-profundities. Even in a second-rate action picture like this, and despite Henriksen's commendable efforts, they're painful to listen to... Woo's creative presence is practically stifled. There are some flashes of his deliriously wild style—a slow-motion moment here, a well-chosen freeze-frame there. He also introduces American audiences to his taste for unique motorcycle stunts and very, very loud car explosions. But these Wooisms are disappointingly minimal". Lance Henriksen received a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Emil Fouchon in the film. In 1997, Woo looked back on Hard Target stating that it was [...] "in some ways, quite a troublesome movie to make, but I'm rather happy with the way the action scenes turned out". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of [...] "B" [...] on an A+ to F scale.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the program}} Ebert & Roeper, Richard Roeper and guest critic Michael Phillips gave the film a {{negative}} review.

2500|$|On the Siskel & Ebert show, Ebert {{gave the}} film a thumbs up while Siskel {{gave it a}} <b>thumbs</b> <b>down.</b> Owen Gleiberman (from Entertainment Weekly) {{described}} the film as [...] "a competent and solidly unsurprising urban-underworld thriller" [...] and is [...] "okay entertainment," [...] but {{went on to say}} that the plot would have worked better [...] "as a lean and mean Miami Vice episode."

2500|$|Armageddon {{received}} mostly negative {{reviews from}} film critics, {{many of whom}} took issue with [...] "the furious pace of its editing". The film is {{on the list of}} Roger Ebert's most hated films. In his original review, Ebert stated, [...] "The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense and the human desire to be entertained". On Siskel and Ebert, Ebert gave it a <b>Thumbs</b> <b>Down.</b> However, his co-host Gene Siskel gave it a Thumbs Up. Ebert went on to name Armageddon as the worst film of 1998 (though he was originally considering Spiceworld). [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety also gave the film a negative review, noting Michael Bay's rapid cutting style: [...] "Much of the confusion, as well as the lack of dramatic rhythm or character development, results directly from Bay's cutting style, which resembles a machine gun stuck in the firing position for 2½ hours." [...] The film has a cumulative 39% [...] "Rotten" [...] rating on Rotten Tomatoes, while achieving a 42% aggregate score on Metacritic. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of [...] "A-" [...] on an A+ to F scale.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the death}} of civil rights leader Coretta Scott King in 2006, BET {{broadcast}} its regularly scheduled music video programming, rather than covering King's funeral live as CNN, Fox News Channel, MSNBC, and BET competitors TV One and Black Family Channel did. The BET website streamed the funeral live, while the channel periodically broadcast taped, 60-second reports from the funeral by senior news correspondent Andre Showell. Michael Lewellen, BET's {{senior vice president for}} corporate communications, defended the decision: [...] "We weighed a number of different options. In the end, we chose to offer a different kind of experience for BET viewers." [...] Lewellen also said that BET received around [...] "two dozen" [...] phone calls and [...] "a handful" [...] of emails criticizing BET for not showing the King funeral live. On the evening of the funeral, February 7, 2006, BET broadcast the tribute special Coretta Scott King: Married to the Mission, and BET repeated this the following Sunday, February 12. Showell hosted a program featuring highlights of the funeral, Coretta Scott King: Celebrating Her Spirit, that broadcast that same day. In its 2007 convention, the National Association of Black Journalists gave BET its <b>Thumbs</b> <b>Down</b> Award for not broadcasting King's funeral live.|$|E
