40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a research project which compared different treatments of remnant municipal waste. The remnant waste materials have been treated either successively by aerobic composting and anaerobic digestion or soley by aerobic composting. The results showed that the degradation of organic matter was not significantly different between the two treatments. Furthermore, it was investigated whether a new method of analyses would provide more precxise results than the ignition loss method with regard to the evaluation of stability of organic matter. Thies new methodology was envisaged to either replacxe the currently used ignition loss method or to supplement it. It was possible to show that the ignition loss method is unsuitable to characterise stability and microbial degradation of organic matter in remnant waste material. On the other hand it became clear that in general, certain methodologies used in <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> are suietable for a differentiated characterisation of organic matter. The content of cellulose and crude fat correlated well with the respiration activity and the potential for gas emissions in anaerobic conditions. The analysis of these parameters might potentially replace the currently used ignition loss method for the description of organic matter. However, these findings have to be evaluated and verified in further studies. It was possible to make definite predictions on the potential effects biologically treated remnant waste material has on a landfill site. The biological treatment results in a level of organic matter stabilisation which diminishes the generation of landfill gas to a negligible level. Biological treatment of remnant waste results also in the improved quality of landfill leachates. (orig.)

40|$|It was of {{importance}} {{in the evaluation of}} feedingstufrs to know its quantitative composition. A qualitative botanical indicated purity but a quantitative test was needed for the degree of purity. Natural feedstuffs always contained a certain amount of foreign material, which could be considered either as natural or chance contamination. The manufacturer had to ensure that commercial feedstuffs had a high degree of purity. Whenever there was consideration in the trade of standards for purity, it was necessary to be able to check these standards. Ezendam worked out a method of measuring impurities both quantitatively and qualitatively. It was tested on some feedstuffs and thus led the way for microscopic study <b>of</b> <b>feedingstuffs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Intensification of milk {{production}} {{is associated with}} {{an increase in the number}} of dairy cows and milk yielding. In order to maintain high milk yield and quality of the produced raw material it is very important to adjust the appropriately balanced dose of feeds. Production of good quality own roughage is a valuable and cheap source of food for animals, but it may be insufficient to provide high milk yielding. As a result, it is necessary to buy commercial concentrated feedingstuffs (mainly protein concentrates and concentrated compounds) which may lead to an increase of production costs. Intensification of {{milk production}} in the economic aspect is justified only in the case of a simultaneous increase in the profitability of this production, which is the relation of the production value and incurred costs. For the economic purpose of milk production the way of feeding the dairy cows should also result from economic calculation and the purchase <b>of</b> commercial <b>feedingstuffs</b> must be economically justified. This article attempts to answer the question whether the increased consumption <b>of</b> commercial concentrated <b>feedingstuffs</b> and increased direct costs are justified by achieved economic results from milk production. The accountancy data were collected according to the methodology of the AGROKOSZTY and Polish FADN system among dairy farms. Grouping of the surveyed farms concerned a level <b>of</b> commercial <b>feedingstuff</b> quantity which (as shown by statistical analysis) was strongly correlated with milk yielding. The designated groups (with small level and high level of usage <b>of</b> commercial <b>feedingstuffs)</b> were analysed in terms of direct costs and labour input as well as the level of income from the activity. The economic results of the surveyed farms showed that the higher costs incurred for the purchase of commercial feedstuffs in the group with high usage <b>of</b> commercial <b>feedingstuffs</b> (average herd in the group was 30 dairy cows with milk yielding of 6, 000 liters per cow) did not allow to achieve much better economic results than in the group with small usage of commercial feedstuffs (average herd in group was 15 cows with milk yielding of 5, 200 litres per cow) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{experiments}} {{were made with}} adult White Leghorn cockerels to study the passage of feed residues through the alimentary canal. The birds were starved for 24 hr and then force-fed known quantities <b>of</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> Excreta were collected quantitatively at 2 hr intervals during the light periods, dried, and weighed. In the first two experiments the birds received 12 hr of light daily while in the third experiment continuous light was used. Residues of oats fed at levels ranging from 6 to 30 g/bird appeared in the excreta within 2 hr and continued to be voided for 52 hr. The rate and duration of residue output were functions of residue input; this was true for, wheat, fish meal, and dehydrated alfalfa as well as oats.

40|$|The {{possibility}} to use NIR scanning microscopy {{for the detection}} of bone fragments in feedingstuffs has been evaluated analysing sediments derived from commercial feedingstuffs samples spiked with MBM. The method appeared sensitive enough to reveal the presence of bone fragments for MBM concentration in the feedingstuffs as low as 0. 05 wt. %. The identiﬁcation of MBM is done versus vegetable ingredients. The validation test, performed on a series <b>of</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> spiked at a 0. 1 wt. % MBM level (the detection limit reached by the ofﬁcial EU method based on optical microscopy), indicated that sensitivity (100 %) and speciﬁcity (96. 30 %) of the investigated method are satisfactory for possible applications in screening procedure.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{master control}} for an {{adiabatic}} bomb calorimeter introduces two automatic modes of operation, but {{little is known}} about the variances of data derived by each mode. Nine samples were assayed in duplicate using each mode on each of 5 days. The resulting data were subjected to analyses of variance to compare the two modes and to estimate components of variance among and within days. The mode had no effect on the gross energy estimates. When sunflower oil and tallow were assayed, the within-day standard deviation was approximately three times greater with the rapid mode than with the reference mode. None of the other 7 samples showed significant differences between modes. Such day-to-day differences as were observed were not consistent over the materials assayed and cannot be attributed to calorimeter operation nor to environmental changes. For most gross energy measurements <b>of</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> and excreta, the rapid mode appears to produce satisfactory data of high reproducibility. The rapid mode permits a greater throughput of samples than conventional adiabatic calorimetry equipment or than the reference mode; up to 35 samples per 7. 5 hr day are assayed in this laboratory.

40|$|Various {{chemical}} agents are {{used during the}} whole production chain of milk and dairy products. Production <b>of</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> is accompanied with pesticide usage, which may remain in environment, thus are transported through feeding into animals, animal products and finally in human organism. Preparation procedure and storage conditions of feed also influence on milk safety {{in the sense of}} mycotoxins entering into the food chain. Chemical agents are, on daily basis, used on dairy farms either as detergents or disinfections. The residuals of cleaning agents might remain in milk if the cleaning agents and its dosage are not performed adequately. Besides already mentioned agents, a great influence in milk production can bee seen through veterinary drugs usage, particularly antibacterial drugs (mastitis). Proper application of drugs and by following legal recommendation, a by-reactions can be avoided such as allergic reaction in humans, development of resisting bacteria or even undesirable influence on starter cultures in dairy products manufacture.

40|$|Directive 2003 / 126 /EC {{defines the}} method for the {{determination}} of constituents of animal origin for official control <b>of</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> One <b>of</b> the hardest problems for microscopist is the differentiation between mammalian and poultry bones {{on the basis of}} some characteristics as colour and borders of the fragments, shape and density of osteocyte lacunae. The shape of osteocyte lacuna in poultry and mammals is often described in different way, elliptic or roundish according with the Author(s). The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the characteristics of lacunae in chicken bones of different type. For this purpose, smashed fragments and histological sections of the same bone were compared in order to evaluate the microscopic aspect of lacunae in different breaking and trimming planes. According to the observations carried out, it was possible to infer that chicken osteocyte has a biconvex lens shape; however the different arrangement and some size variation of the osteocytes in the several bone segments influence the microscopic features of corresponding lacunae. Chicken bone is made of a parallel-fibered tissue, without osteons. This structure probably determines the plane fracture of the bone and consequently the different aspect of lacunae (from spindle-shaped to elliptic-roundish) we can see in chicken derived PAP (processed animal protein). For example, in the fragments obtained from smashed diaphysis, the prevalence of spindle-shaped lacunae is depending on the preferential breaking of the bone along longitudinal plane. Likewise, for the epiphysis, being made mostly by bone trabeculae with strange directions, the breaking happens along different planes, creating lacunae of various shape. Performing the official check <b>of</b> animal <b>feedingstuffs,</b> the presence <b>of</b> bone fragments with roundish or elliptic osteocyte lacunae induces the analyst to thinking that the meat and bone meal comes respectively from mammals and poultry or vice versa depending to the reference Author(s); apart from the final evaluation (also based on some other features of the fragments), it is important to consider that the chicken bones could show lacunae of different shapes (spindle, elliptic and roundish), in accordance with the type and the breaking of the involved skeleton segments...|$|R
40|$|Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a {{mycotoxin}} {{produced by}} {{several species of}} Aspergillus and Penicillium fungi. The presence of OTA in food and feeds is potentially dangerous {{to the health of}} both humans and animals. OTA is detected in various food and feed sources such as barley, oats, rye, wheat, coffee beans, cocoa, spices, licorice, wine, beer, fruits and dry fruits. The presence of OTA in feeds can lead to the contamination of livestock products, especially swine and aquaculture fish through the “carry over” event. Several studies show the high toxicity of this molecule which turns out to be nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic, neurotoxic, teratogenic, carcinogenic and immunotoxic. In this study, OTA was analyzed in tissues samples of fish (liver, kidney and muscle). An enzymatic digestion and purification process was carried out to all samples, which were then analyzed using an HPLC method with a fluorimetric detector. The analytical method used was in this study has shown to be accurate, sensitive and selective and allowed to quantify the OTA in the samples analyzed at levels in the ng/g order. From the analyzes carried out, it was observed that the matrix with higher percentages of positivity was the kidney, followed by the liver and the fish muscle.
