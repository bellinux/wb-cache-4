Deutrom outlined the ambition as he unveiled the new strategic plan for Irish cricket to 2015. The plan set out a series of stretching goals including increasing <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> in the game to 50,000, setting a target of reaching 8th in the World rankings, establishing a domestic first-class cricket structure, and reinforcing cricket as the fifth most popular team sport in Ireland.|$|E

40|$|The {{energy and}} {{centrality}} dependences of charged particle pseudorapidity density in relativistic nuclear collisions were studied using a hadron and string cascade model, JPCIAE.

The predictions for Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy were also given. We computed the participant nucleon distributions using different methods. It was found that <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>participant</b> nucleons is not a well defined variable both experimentally and theoretically. Thus it may be inappropriate to use the charged particle pseudorapidity density per participant pair as a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>participant</b> nucleons for distinguishing various theoretical models.
