To determine whether parasite-derived Ag preferentially expand a Th 2 -like cell population, a filter immunoplaque assay was used to enumerate the frequencies (Fo) of PBMC and CD 4 +-enriched PBMC from individuals with helminth infections secreting selected cytokines in response to parasite-derived (PAg) and nonparasite antigens (NPAg). In 20 individuals with lymphatic filariasis, frequency analysis of PBMC secreting IL- 4 and IFN- g indicated that the F 0, of PAg -specific IL- 4 -secreting cells (geometric mean F 0 (GM) : 1 / 12, 100) was 57 -fold higher than <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> <b>F</b> 0 of NPAg -reactive cells (GM: 1 / 692, 000; p < 0. 02).

In another group of heirninth-infected individuals, the F 0 of highly enriched CD 4 + cells secreting IL- 4 and IL- 5 in response to PAg (GMs: 1 / 2, 600 and 1 / 5, 600 CD 4 + cells, respectively) were also found to be significantly higher than those specific for NPAg (GMs: l/ 291, 000 and 1 / 303, 000 CD 4 +; p < 0. 05 and p < 0. 01, respectively), whereas <b>the</b> <b>corresponding</b> <b>F</b> 0 IFN- g- and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF-secreting cells were equivalent for PAg and NPag. Furthermore, the proportion of PAg-specific IL- 4 - and IL- 5 -secreting CD 4 + cells relative to all cells secreting the given cytokine were approximately 29 -fold higher than the proportion of NPAg-specific cells secreting these cytokines. Again, the corresponding proportions of Ag-specific IFN- g- and GM-CSF-secreting CD 4 + cells were equivalent for PAg and NPAg. Thus, in this ex vivo system, a circulating population of IL- 4 - and IL- 5 -secreting (Th 2 -like) cells has been shown to exist in humans; PAg appears to expand these cells preferentially.
