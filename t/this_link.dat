5|$|Access to the {{navigation}} was improved for traditional canal boats {{with the opening}} of the Runcorn and Weston Canal, which was completed in 1859. The canal left the Weston Canal at Weston Point, and provided a link to Runcorn Docks, near which two flights of locks connected to the Bridgewater Canal. <b>This</b> <b>link</b> was severed in 1966, when the Runcorn to Widnes road bridge was constructed. Half of the Runcorn and Weston Canal was filled in at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Likely of Balkan origin, Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Aelia Verina, wife of Leo I. It {{has been argued that}} Basiliscus was uncle to the {{chieftain}} of the Heruli, Odoacer. <b>This</b> <b>link</b> is based on the interpretation of a fragment by John of Antioch (209.1), which states that Odoacer and Armatus, Basiliscus' nephew, were brothers. However, not all scholars accept this interpretation, since sources do not say anything about the foreign origin of Basiliscus. It is known that Basiliscus had a wife, Zenonis, and at least one son, Marcus.|$|E
5|$|Other {{important}} {{texts of}} Shaktism include the Shakta Upanishads, {{as well as}} Shakta-oriented Upa Puranic literature such as the Devi Purana and Kalika Purana, the Lalita Sahasranama (from the Brahmanda Purana). The Tripura Upanishad is historically the most complete introduction to Shakta Tantrism, distilling into its 16 verses almost every important topic in Shakta Tantra tradition. Along with the Tripura Upanishad, the Tripuratapini Upanishad has attracted scholarly bhasya (commentary) {{in the second half}} of 2nd-millennium, such as by Bhaskararaya, and by Ramanand. These texts link the Shakti Tantra tradition as a Vedic attribute, however <b>this</b> <b>link</b> has been contested by scholars.|$|E

5|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} thought to {{contribute}} to the development of a wide range of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, the pathologies caused by diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegeneration in motor neuron diseases. In many of these cases, it is unclear if oxidants trigger the disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; One case in which <b>this</b> <b>link</b> is particularly well understood is the role of oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease. Here, low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation appears to trigger the process of atherogenesis, which results in atherosclerosis, and finally cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Service on the Blue Line {{began on}} July 1, 1977, on 18 {{stations}} between National Airport in Arlington and Stadium-Armory in Washington – the first link of the Metro to Virginia. The line was extended by three stations to Addison Road on November 22, 1980. Service south of National Airport began on June 15, 1991 when Van Dorn Street opened. The original {{plan for the}} line was completed when <b>this</b> <b>link</b> was extended to Franconia–Springfield on June 29, 1997. Two new stations in Maryland – Morgan Boulevard and Largo Town Center – opened on December 18, 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II in September1939 temporarily halted McQuesten's ambitions, as funding was quickly {{shifted to the}} war effort. As a result, construction on the new superhighway was put on hold south of Niagara Falls. McQuesten officially opened the QEW on August23, 1940; the pavement ended south of Lundy's Lane. Despite the war, work began on {{a link between the}} highway and the Rainbow Bridge through the centre of Niagara Falls. <b>This</b> <b>link</b> would not be completed in time for the opening of the new bridge.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relative}} merits of a potentially useful item response theory (IRT) linking design: using a single set of anchor items with fixed common item parameters (FCIP) during the calibration process. An empirical study was conducted to investigate the appropriateness of <b>this</b> <b>linking</b> design using 6 groups of students taking 6 forms of a pilot test, for an accumulated sample size of 8, 357 students. A parameter recovery study was performed to examine the robustness of FCIP under the situation of large standard errors in the item difficulty and guessing parameters. Comparison of these results to those produced by the characteristics curve method (CCM) was pursued. Based on the empirical portion of this study, ability estimates calibrated from <b>this</b> <b>linking</b> design are very consistent, except for students with extreme (especially low) ability under the CCM equating method. Item parameter estimates calibrated from <b>this</b> <b>linking</b> design are also very consistent, except for guessing parameters under the CC...|$|R

5|$|At the {{cemetery}} in Sampul (Chinese: 山普拉), ~14km from the archaeological site of Khotan in Lop County, Xinjiang, China, where the aforementioned Sampul tapestry was found, the local inhabitants buried their dead there from roughly 217 BC to 283 AD. Mitochondrial DNA {{analysis of the}} human remains has revealed genetic affinities to peoples from the Caucasus, specifically a maternal lineage linked to Ossetians and Iranians, {{as well as an}} Eastern-Mediterranean paternal lineage. Seeming to confirm <b>this</b> <b>link,</b> from historical accounts it is known that Alexander the Great, who married a Sogdian woman from Bactria named Roxana, encouraged his soldiers and generals to marry local women; consequentially the later kings of the Seleucid Empire and Greco-Bactrian Kingdom had a mixed Persian-Greek ethnic background.|$|E
5|$|But for the Axis, the interdiction {{campaign}} from Malta caused chronic {{supply shortages}} in Africa. By April 1943, the Allied armies had pushed the supply-starved Axis {{forces to the}} northern tip of Tunisia, near its capital Tunis. Despite the desperate situation, the OKW continued to send in significant reinforcement and supply tonnage to the besieged Axis forces by air. To prevent prolonged resistance, the Allies, now aware of the German supply timetables through the use of British Ultra, launched an aerial offensive to destroy <b>this</b> <b>link.</b> It was due to begin in the last week of March 1943, but bad weather over Tunisia meant that it could not begin until 5 April.|$|E
5|$|Colorado held several {{meetings}} to convince reluctant Utah officials they {{would benefit from}} a freeway link between Denver and Salt Lake City. Utah officials expressed concerns that, given the terrain between these cities, <b>this</b> <b>link</b> {{would be difficult to}} build. They later expressed concerns that the construction would drain resources from completing Interstate Highways they deemed to have a higher priority. Colorado officials persisted, presenting three alternatives to route I-70 west of Denver, using the corridors of US40, US6 and a route starting at Pueblo, proceeding west along US50/US285/US24. In March 1955, Colorado officials succeeded in convincing Utah officials with the state legislature passing a resolution supporting a link with Denver. The two states jointly issued a proposal to the U.S. Congress that would extend the plans for I-70 along the US6 corridor. Under this proposal the freeway would terminate at I-15 near Spanish Fork, Utah, linking the Front Range and Wasatch Front metropolitan areas.|$|E

5|$|Jacobsen quotes textual {{evidence}} that the Akkadian word eššebu (owl) corresponds to the Sumerian word ninna, and that the Sumerian Dnin-ninna (Divine lady ninna) corresponds to the Akkadian Ishtar. The Sumerian ninna can also be translated as the Akkadian kilili, {{which is also a}} name or epithet for Ishtar. Inanna/Ishtar as harlot or goddess of harlots was a well known theme in Mesopotamian mythology and in one text, Inanna is called kar-kid (harlot) and ab-ba--šú, which in Akkadian would be rendered kilili. Thus {{there appears to be a}} cluster of metaphors linking prostitute and owl and the goddess Inanna/Ishtar; this could match the most enigmatic component of the relief to a well known aspect of Ishtar. Jacobsen concludes that <b>this</b> <b>link</b> would be sufficient to explain talons and wings, and adds that nudity could indicate the relief was originally the house-altar of a bordello.|$|E
5|$|The East Plains Trail {{followed}} the older routes of the West Plains Trail from Pembina to Breckenridge, Minnesota, then struck east {{by a variety}} of routes out of the Red River Valley across the upper valleys of the Pomme de Terre and Chippewa Rivers (tributaries of the Minnesota River), to Saint Cloud and Sauk Rapids on the Upper Mississippi. Soon however, a branch was added to connect the East Plains Trail with the Woods Trail. <b>This</b> <b>link</b> skirted the west slope of the Leaf Mountains and joined the East Plains routes at Elbow Lake or near the Otter Tail River. At times, this eastern connection may have been the better-travelled of the two variants.|$|E
5|$|This {{disparity}} between the sizes of the megaliths is unparalleled among the other surviving stone circles in the Dorset area, {{and may have been}} a deliberate choice by the circle's builders, perhaps reflecting sexual symbolism. There are a number of similar circles in south-western Scotland, for example the Loupin' Stones, Ninestane Rigg, and Burgh Hill, all of which share the architectural feature of having two taller stones on their perimeters. Potentially supporting <b>this</b> <b>link</b> between Dorset and south-western Scotland {{is the fact that the}} Grey Mare and her Colts—a chambered long barrow located two and a half miles south-west of the Nine Stones—displays architectural similarities with the Clyde-Solway tradition of chambered long barrows.|$|E
