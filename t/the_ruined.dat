50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as <b>the</b> <b>ruins</b> of Charax Spasinu.This claim is based on the scale of <b>the</b> <b>ruins,</b> <b>the</b> fact that the local name for <b>the</b> <b>ruins</b> is Naysān which is probably a corruption of the Parthian name Maysān, and the location of <b>the</b> <b>ruins</b> at <b>the</b> confluence of the Tigris and Karkheh Rivers as stated of Charax Spasinu, by Pliny the Elder.|$|R

5|$|In the 1880s, Esteban Martínez, {{the parish}} priest of <b>the</b> <b>ruined</b> church, {{approached}} Spanish architect Genaro Palacios {{with a plan}} to build a fire and earthquake-resistant structure made entirely of steel.

5|$|A Miss Williams {{from nearby}} Borley Lodge said {{she saw the}} figure of the ghostly nun in the upstairs window and, {{according}} to Harry Price, demanded a fee of one guinea for her story. In August 1943, Price conducted a brief dig in the cellars of <b>the</b> <b>ruined</b> house and discovered two bones thought to be of a young woman. The bones were given a Christian burial in Liston churchyard, after the parish of Borley refused to allow the ceremony to take place on account of the local opinion that the bones found were those of a pig.|$|E

5|$|A small, unisex monastic {{community}} in Bithynia, near Constantinople, may {{have developed the}} cross-in-square plan church during the Iconoclastic period, which would explain the plan's small scale and unified naos. <b>The</b> <b>ruined</b> church of St. John at Pelekete monastery is an early example. Monks had supported the use of icons, unlike the government-appointed secular clergy, and monasticism would become increasingly popular. A new type of privately funded urban monastery developed from the 9th century on, which may help to explain {{the small size of}} subsequent building.|$|E
5|$|But, after {{assessing}} {{the situation in}} Alsace, Julian evidently decided that his force was insufficient to prevail over the Alamanni alone. Instead, {{he set out to}} recover Cologne. From Metz, he led his army via Treviri (Trier) to Roman-held Koblenz and thence along the Rhine to Cologne. Entering <b>the</b> <b>ruined</b> city unopposed, Julian's men were set to work to rebuild the city walls. Julian then concluded a peace treaty with the Franks. This had the important result of removing half the opposition from the equation and allowing Julian to focus his resources on dealing with the Alamanni.|$|E

Brought before Julian, whom he begged for mercy, Chnodomar was sent on to the court of Constantius at Milan. Not long afterwards, he died of disease in a camp for barbarian prisoners in Rome.|$|E

Now the deep-diving submersible DSV Alvin could take people back to Titanic {{for the first time}} since her sinking, and the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Jason Jr. would allow the explorers to investigate the interior of the wreck. Another system, ANGUS, was used to carry out photo surveys of the debris field. Jason Jr. descended <b>the</b> <b>ruined</b> Grand Staircase as far as B Deck, and photographed remarkably well preserved interiors, including some chandeliers still hanging from the ceilings.|$|E
