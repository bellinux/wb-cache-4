5|$|In January 1990, The Little Mermaid earned three Academy Award nominations, {{making it}} the first Disney {{animated}} film to earn an Academy Award nomination since <b>The</b> <b>Rescuers</b> in 1977. The film won two of the awards, for Best Song ("Under the Sea") and Best Score. The film also earned four Golden Globe nominations, including Best Picture—Comedy or Musical, and won the awards for Best Song ("Under the Sea") and Best Score.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rescuers,</b> {{released}} in 1977, {{was a success}} exceeding {{the achievements of the}} previous two Disney features. Receiving broad critical acclaim, commercial returns, and an Academy Award nomination, it ended up being the third highest-grossing film of the year and the most successful and acclaimed Disney animated film since The Jungle Book. The film was reissued in 1983, accompanied by a new Disney featurette, Mickey's Christmas Carol.|$|E
5|$|The author Rupert Christiansen {{points out}} that the {{painting}} depicts more figures than had been on the raft {{at the time of the}} rescue—including corpses which were not recorded by <b>the</b> <b>rescuers.</b> Instead of the sunny morning and calm water reported on the day of the rescue, Géricault depicted a gathering storm and dark, heaving sea to reinforce the emotional gloom.|$|E
50|$|Conscious {{casualties}} may {{panic and}} put <b>the</b> <b>rescuer's</b> safety at risk particularly when <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> approaches a casualty in {{or under the}} water. It {{may be possible to}} avoid contacting a panicked casualty by throwing a rope or buoyancy aid and encouraging the casualty to help him or herself. If contact must be made, <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> should try to approach the casualty from a direction that presents least risk to <b>the</b> <b>rescuer,</b> such as from behind. Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> may need to wait until the casualty is incapacitated before approaching.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, the {{relationship}} between the victim and <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> can be one of codependency. <b>The</b> <b>rescuer</b> keeps <b>the</b> victim dependent on them by encouraging their victimhood. The victim gets their needs met by having <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> take care of them.|$|R

5|$|Accompanied {{in theaters}} by the Mickey Mouse {{featurette}} The Prince and the Pauper, <b>The</b> <b>Rescuers</b> Down Under (1990) was Disney's first animated feature sequel and the studio's first film {{to be fully}} colored and composited via computer using the CAPS system. However, the film did not duplicate the success of The Little Mermaid. The next Disney animated feature, Beauty and the Beast, had begun production in London but was moved back to Burbank after Disney decided to shutter the London satellite office and retool the film into a musical-comedy format similar to The Little Mermaid. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman were retained to write the song score, though Ashman died before production was completed.|$|E
5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after <b>The</b> <b>Rescuers</b> Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar. The software allowed for {{a wider range of}} colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{watches the}} aftermath of the explosion on the news, knowing that the group will ask for his assistance with the case. Dees is among <b>the</b> <b>rescuers</b> seen on the broadcast. Black travels to DC and meets up with fellow group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn). The two join the FBI task force investigating the bombing, led by special agents Pierson (Sam Anderson) and Takahashi (Hiro Kanagawa). Watts and Black quickly dismiss several false claims of responsibility by terrorist groups. Black listens to the 911 call left by Dees, deducing that the numbers dialled spell the word kaboom on a telephone keypad.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> pushes <b>the</b> casualty's far {{shoulder}} upwards {{with the}} other hand causing the head to twist towards <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{possible}} to use <b>the</b> <b>rescuer's</b> buoyancy compensator to lift both divers. A technique for this is taught by some agencies, in which <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> holds <b>the</b> casualty with his/her legs wrapped round the torso, freeing the hands for buoyancy control. This technique does not allow <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> to provide upward thrust by finning, and all lift must be from buoyancy. A further problem {{is that if the}} divers are separated, <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> will be positively buoyant, and the victim may well be negative, and sink away before the situation can be corrected.|$|R
25|$|Rescue {{involves}} {{bringing the}} person's {{mouth and nose}} above the water surface. A drowning person may cling to <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> and try to pull {{himself out of the}} water, submerging <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> in <b>the</b> process. <b>Rescuers</b> should avoid endangering themselves unnecessarily and where possible should provide assistance from a safe position, such as a boat, or by providing flotation or a means of towing from a distance.|$|R
5|$|The {{house of}} one of the farmworkers was at the crash site. He first ran to his house, where he found that his wife had survived and was safe. Richards rescued one man from the {{wreckage}} and put him by an apple tree. Another survivor was on fire. In a contemporary inverview one of <b>the</b> <b>rescuers</b> says the survivor came running across the farmyard. 60 years later Richards said he rescued the survivor from the aircraft. Accounts agree that rescuers put the survivor in a horse trough to extinguish the flames and cool his burns.|$|E
5|$|The rescue {{was led by}} the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), and {{it became}} the largest rescue in that institution's 190-year history. RNLI lifeboats, manned by local volunteers from {{stations}} at the Lizard, Cadgwith, Coverack and Porthleven, rescued all the passengers, including 70 babies, {{as well as the}} crew. The operation took 16 hours to complete. As a result of the successful efforts of <b>the</b> <b>rescuers,</b> four silver RNLI medals were awarded to various volunteers and two were awarded to Suevic crew members for their actions. In March 2007 a ceremony was held to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the rescue.|$|E
5|$|In a {{nighttime}} raid, {{under the cover}} of darkness and a distraction by a P-61 Black Widow, the group surprised the Japanese forces in and around the camp. Hundreds of Japanese troops were killed in the 30-minute coordinated attack; the Americans suffered minimal casualties. The Rangers, Scouts, and guerrillas escorted the POWs back to American lines. The rescue allowed the prisoners to tell of the death march and prison camp atrocities, which sparked a new rush of resolve for the war against Japan. <b>The</b> <b>rescuers</b> were awarded commendations by MacArthur, and were also recognized by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A memorial now sits {{on the site of the}} former camp, and the events of the raid have been depicted in several films.|$|E
50|$|If the {{casualty}} is incapacitated or exhausted, help {{is needed to}} move {{the casualty}} to safety. Towing is time consuming and will exhaust <b>the</b> <b>rescuer,</b> especially in rough water, currents, or if <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> is wearing high-drag equipment such as a drysuit or carrying bulky equipment.|$|R
50|$|Rescue tether: Surface {{supplied}} standby divers {{may carry}} a short {{length of rope}} with a clip on each end to support a disabled diver from <b>the</b> <b>rescuer's</b> harness, to allow <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> <b>the</b> use of both hands during the recovery to the bell or the surface.|$|R
5000|$|BLS {{protocols}} {{continue until}} (1) the patient regains a pulse, (2) <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> is relieved by another rescuer of equivalent or higher training (see patient abandonment), (3) <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> is too physically tired to continue CPR, or (4) {{the patient is}} pronounced dead by a medical doctor.|$|R
5|$|No one at Truckee Lake {{had died}} during the interim between the {{departure}} of the first relief party and the arrival of the second relief party. Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February from Mrs. Murphy, who said that her family was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott's mutilated body. The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members of the relief party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg. When they made their presence known, he threw it into a hole in the snow that contained the mostly dismembered body of Jacob Donner. Inside the tent, Elizabeth Donner refused to eat, although her children were being nourished by the organs of their father. <b>The</b> <b>rescuers</b> discovered that three other bodies had already been consumed. In the other tent, Tamsen Donner was well, but George was very ill because the infection had reached his shoulder.|$|E
5|$|The Little Mermaid, Disney's first {{animated}} {{fairy tale}} since Sleeping Beauty (1959), {{is an important}} film in animation history for many reasons. Chief among these are its re-establishment of animation as a profitable venture for The Walt Disney Company, as the company's theme parks, television productions, and live-action features had overshadowed the animated output since the 1950s. Mermaid was the second film, following Oliver & Company, produced after Disney began expanding its animated output following its successful live action/animated film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and became Disney's first animated major box office and critical hit since <b>The</b> <b>Rescuers</b> in 1977. Walt Disney Feature Animation was further expanded {{as a result of}} Mermaid and increasingly successful follow-ups — Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), and The Lion King (1994). The staff increased from 300 members in 1988 to 2,200 in 1999 spread across three studios in Burbank, California, Lake Buena Vista, Florida, and Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of <b>The</b> <b>Rescuers</b> signaled {{the beginning of}} a changing of the guard process in the personnel at the Disney animation studio: as veterans such as Milt Kahl and Les Clark retired, they were gradually replaced by new talents such as Don Bluth, Ron Clements, John Musker, and Glen Keane. The new animators, culled from the animation program at CalArts and trained by Eric Larson, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Woolie Reitherman got their first chances to prove themselves as a group with the animated sequences in Disney's live-action/animated hybrid feature Pete's Dragon (1977), the animation for which was directed by Don Bluth. In September 1979, dissatisfied with what they felt was a stagnation {{in the development of the}} art of animation at Disney, Bluth and several of the other new guard animators quit to start their own studio, Don Bluth Productions, which became Disney's chief competitor in the animation field during the 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|Essentially {{it means}} that <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> can recover damages from a {{defendant}} when <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> is injured rescuing someone. The defendant is usually negligent in causing the accident to occur. Other cases have occurred where the plaintiff is injured rescuing the defendant {{and is able to}} collect damages.|$|R
5000|$|If {{a victim}} becomes unresponsive {{he should be}} lowered to the ground, and <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> should call {{emergency}} medical services and initiate CPR. When the airway is opened during CPR, <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> should look into the mouth for an object causing obstruction, and remove it if it is evident.|$|R
50|$|In firefighting, {{smoke and}} heat are greater higher up, {{and may be}} fatal to the person being carried. The person carried is largely outside <b>the</b> <b>rescuer's</b> field of vision, and almost all vital areas are out of <b>the</b> <b>rescuer's</b> view. Thus, {{dangerous}} changes in their condition can be missed, and an inexperienced rescuer can inadvertently create or further compound injuries via collision with obstacles. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>rescuer's</b> obstructed peripheral vision puts both persons at risk if the incident that caused the injury is still ongoing (fire, combat, public disturbances, etc.).|$|R
5|$|Kroonlands lifeboat, {{manned by}} a fresh crew, headed {{back out and}} {{returned}} with 13 steerage passengers. On board Volturno, the crew {{and some of the}} male passengers, unable to extinguish the fire, were at least able to keep it from spreading to the aft cargo holds, over which the others on board were gathered. Shortly before dawn, a large explosion—probably of her boilers—rocked Volturno, and <b>the</b> <b>rescuers</b> felt that the ship, which had not been in imminent danger of sinking up to this point, might founder at any time. The tanker Narragansett turned on her pumps and sprayed lubricating oil on the sea to help calm the surface. The combined effect of the oil and the lessening of the storm allowed many more lifeboats to be sent to Volturnos aid. Kroonland launched two more boats herself and saved 75 more, including Captain Inch, the last person to leave the stricken ship. In all, some 520 passengers and crew were rescued by the ten ships—89 on Kroonland alone. The loss of life was limited to around 130, mostly women and children from the early lifeboat launchings.|$|E
5|$|This {{rescue mission}} {{was the first}} {{official}} United States military expedition to the Arctic; previous expeditions, including that of the Polaris itself, had been led by civilians. The Tigress sailed from New York on July14, 1873, traveling first to St. John's, Newfoundland and then to Godhavn and Upernavik in Greenland before following the coast further north. The crew searched North Star Bay, Northumberland Island, and Hartstene Bay before discovering {{the first sign of}} the Polaris crew: a camp on Littleton Island where they had wintered, now occupied by Inuit. The missing men, <b>the</b> <b>rescuers</b> were told, had constructed makeshift boats salvaged from their destroyed ship and traveled south. Acting on this clue, the Tigress searched the Baffin Island coast to Cumberland Sound, and then the Greenland coast from Ivigtut to Fiskenæsset and the Davis Strait, before returning to St. John's for fuel. Once there, they learned that the Polaris survivors had been rescued by a British ship and that their search was over. After returning to New York the Tigress was transferred back to civilian use.|$|E

25|$|Where it is {{necessary}} to approach a panicking person in deep water, it is advised that <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> approach with a buoyant object, or from behind, twisting the person's arm on the back to restrict movement. If <b>the</b> <b>rescuer</b> does get pushed under water, they can dive downwards to escape.|$|R

5000|$|The fireman's carry, {{utilizing}} {{back and}} shoulder strength, is engineered {{as an emergency}} measure to optimize power, endurance, and mobility.

25|$|The idea {{of doing}} an {{animated}} film about Sherlock Holmes with animals was first discussed about during {{the production of}} <b>The</b> <b>Rescuers.</b> Veteran layout artist Joe Hale is credited with suggesting to adapt the children's book series Basil of Baker Street by Eve Titus, but the project fell into development limbo because of the similarities to <b>The</b> <b>Rescuers.</b> In 1982, Ron Clements proposed adapting the children's book series into an animated feature and, along with story artist Pete Young, it was pitched to Disney President and CEO Ron Miller who approved the project. Earlier in his career, Clements created a fifteen-minute Sherlock Holmes animated short recorded on Super 8 film. Because the animators were displeased with the direction The Black Cauldron was heading, Basil of Baker Street was approved as an alternative project.|$|E
25|$|Newhart later {{went into}} acting, {{starring}} as Chicago psychologist Dr. Robert Hartley in The Bob Newhart Show during the 1970s {{and then as}} Vermont innkeeper Dick Loudon on the 1980s series Newhart. He also had two short-lived sitcoms in the 1990s titled Bob and George and Leo. Newhart also appeared in film roles such as Major Major in Catch-22 and Papa Elf in Elf. He provided the voice of Bernard in the Walt Disney animated films <b>The</b> <b>Rescuers</b> and <b>The</b> <b>Rescuers</b> Down Under. In 2004, he played the library head Judson in The Librarian, a character which continued in 2014 to the TV series The Librarians.
