25|$|Vasco da Gama, {{seeing the}} near {{destruction}} of his caravels, prays {{to his own}} God, but it is Venus who helps the Portuguese by sending the Nymphs to seduce the winds and calm them down. After the storm, the armada sights Calicut, and Vasco da Gama gives <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God.</b> The canto ends with the poet speculating {{about the value of}} the fame and glory reached through great deeds.|$|E
25|$|For Ben-Hur, Simonides bribes Sejanus {{to remove}} the prefect Valerius Gratus from his post; Valerius is succeeded by Pontius Pilate. Ben-Hur sets out for Jerusalem to find his mother and sister. Pilate's review of the prison records reveals great injustice, and he notes Gratus {{concealed}} a walled-up cell. Pilate's troops reopen the cell to find two women, Judah's long-lost mother and sister, suffering from leprosy. Pilate releases them, and {{they go to the}} old Hur house, which is vacant. Finding Judah asleep on the steps, they give <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God</b> that he is alive, but do not wake him. As lepers, they are considered less than human. Banished from the city, they leave in the morning.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the film}} is a feel good film, what mars it {{is the fact that}} it takes the viewers back to the 70’s when such goody goody tales about how a man succeeds in life <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God’s</b> help were popular.|$|R
50|$|The {{location}} identified {{most closely}} with well dressing is Tissington in Derbyshire, though {{the origins of}} the tradition are obscure. It probably began as a pagan custom of offering <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>gods</b> for a reliable water supply, though other suggested explanations include villagers celebrating the purity of their water supply after surviving the Black Death in 1348, or alternatively celebrating their water's constancy during a prolonged drought in 1615.|$|R

25|$|Owing to Siraj ud Dowla’s {{harshness}} of {{temper and}} indulgence, fear and terror had {{settled on the}} hearts of everyone {{to such an extent}} that no one among his generals of the army or the noblemen of the city was free from anxiety. Among his officers, whoever went to wait on Siraj ud Dowla despaired of life and honour, and whoever returned without being disgraced and ill-treated offered <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God.</b> Siraj ud Dowla treated all the noblemen and capable generals of Alivardi Khan with ridicule and drollery, and bestowed on each some contemptuous nickname that ill-suited any of them. And whatever harsh expressions and abusive epithet came to his lips, Siraj ud Dowla uttered them unhesitatingly in the face of everyone, and no one had the boldness to breathe freely in his presence.|$|E
25|$|According to Jewish law, when Jewish boys become 13 years old, {{they become}} {{accountable}} for their actions and become a bar mitzvah. A girl becomes a bat mitzvah {{at the age of}} 12 according to Orthodox and Conservative Jews, and at the age of 13 according to Reform Jews. Prior to reaching bar mitzvah age, the child's parents hold the responsibility for the child's actions. After this age, the boys and girls bear their own responsibility for Jewish ritual law, tradition, and ethics, and are able to participate in all areas of Jewish community life. Traditionally, the father of the bar mitzvah gives <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God</b> that he is no longer punished for the child's sins (Genesis Rabba, Toldot 23:11). In addition to being considered {{accountable for their}} actions from a religious perspective, b'nai mitzvah may be counted towards a minyan (prayer quorum) and may lead prayer and other religious services in the family and the community.|$|E
25|$|As a teenager, he {{was greatly}} {{troubled by the}} Metaphysics of Aristotle, which he could not {{understand}} until he read al-Farabi's commentary on the work. For {{the next year and}} a half, he studied philosophy, in which he encountered greater obstacles. In such moments of baffled inquiry, he would leave his books, perform the requisite ablutions, then go to the mosque, and continue in prayer till light broke on his difficulties. Deep into the night, he would continue his studies, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the Metaphysics of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination, from the little commentary by Farabi, which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams. So great was his joy at the discovery, made {{with the help of a}} work from which he had expected only mystery, that he hastened to return <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God,</b> and bestowed alms upon the poor.|$|E

50|$|Riitta {{is dying}} three years later. She feels calm and remembers the happy {{illusion}} {{of the first}} homestead on the island, where Paavo used <b>to</b> sing <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God's</b> blessings. Paavo is surprised: Riitta can give thanks. Yes, she replies, and sees the barrier of Heaven open in front of her. She asks Paavo to recite a thanksgiving hymn. He sings and Juhana joins in. Riitta rises and goes toward her son to Heaven's door.|$|R
500|$|In {{the first}} chorale, [...] "" [...] (Now let {{everyone}} thank God), Bach uses the first {{theme of the}} opening again, simultaneously with the chorale tune. Helmuth Rilling notes the unity of topic, praise and <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God,</b> {{for the first three}} movements. The praise, individual in the preceding aria, is now communal again, [...] "a rousing hymn, now given the most extrovert of settings!" [...] Gardiner assumes that the sermon may have followed the chorale.|$|E
500|$|The autumn {{celebration in}} late 1621 {{that has become}} known as [...] "The First Thanksgiving" [...] was not known as such to the Pilgrims. The first [...] "Thanksgiving" [...] as the Pilgrims would have called it (referring to solemn {{ceremony}} of praise and <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God</b> for a congregation's good fortune) did not occur until 1623, in response to the good news of the arrival of additional colonists and supplies. That event probably occurred in July and consisted of a full day of prayer and worship and probably very little revelry.|$|E
500|$|The poet {{derived from}} the gospel idea that <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God</b> for his {{goodness}} are man's obligation. A profound scholar of the Bible, he quotes for the opening chorus a verse from Psalm 50 (...) {{and for the first}} recitative in Part II verses 15 and 16 from the gospel. He alludes to the Bible several times, for example telling about God's creation by [...] in movement 2 and [...] in movement 3, to [...] in movement 6, [...] "" [...] (Love, peace, righteousness and joy in Your spirit). The closing chorale is the third stanza of the hymn [...] "" [...] (1525) by Johann Gramann (Poliander).|$|E

500|$|A four-part chorus in stile antico {{illustrates}} {{the idea of}} thanks and praise, again with trumpets and timpani. It {{is based on the}} first choral movement of , which also expresses the idea of <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God</b> and praise of his creation. The first part of the text, devoted to thanks, is a melody in even tempo that rises gradually and falls again. The voices enter without instrumental support in dense succession. The countersubject on the second line [...] "propter magnam gloriam tuam" [...] (for your great glory), devoted to the glory of God, is more complex in rhythm. Similarly, in the cantata the second line [...] "und verkündigen deine Wunder" [...] (and proclaim your wonders) leads to a more vivid countersubject. Towards the end of the movement, the trumpets take part in the polyphony of the dense movement.|$|E
500|$|The {{thought is}} {{continued}} in [...] "" [...] (to the Father, almighty), in a four-part choral movement with trumpets. The movement probably shares its original source {{with the opening}} chorus of [...] (God, as Your name is, so is also Your praise), which also expresses the idea of <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God</b> and praise of his creation. The voices sing a fugue to a concerto of the orchestra. The bass introduces the theme, without an instrumental opening, while the other voices repeat simultaneously in homophony [...] "" [...] as a firm statement. The theme contains all eight notes of the scale, as a symbol completeness. Bach noted {{at the end of}} the movement that it contains 84 measures, the multiplication of 7 and 12, a hint at the symbolic meaning of numbers. The word [...] "" [...] appears 49 times (7*7), the words [...] "" [...] 84 times.|$|E
500|$|Though Elizabeth {{followed}} a largely defensive foreign policy, her reign raised England's status abroad. [...] "She {{is only a}} woman, only mistress of half an island," [...] marvelled Pope Sixtus V, [...] "and yet she makes herself feared by Spain, by France, by the Empire, by all". Under Elizabeth, the nation gained a new self-confidence and sense of sovereignty, as Christendom fragmented. Elizabeth was the first Tudor to recognise that a monarch ruled by popular consent. She therefore always worked with parliament and advisers she could trust {{to tell her the}} truth—a style of government that her Stuart successors failed to follow. Some historians have called her lucky; she believed that God was protecting her. Priding herself on being [...] "mere English", Elizabeth trusted in God, honest advice, and the love of her subjects for the success of her rule. In a prayer, she offered <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God</b> that: ...|$|E

500|$|The jury retired {{during the}} morning of 20 June. They {{returned}} just over two days later, and acquitted all four defendants on all charges. The judge awarded costs to Deakin, but not to Holmes or Le Mesurier who he thought had been insufficiently co-operative in the enquiry. Thorpe made no application for costs. In a brief public statement, {{he said that he}} considered the verdict as [...] "totally fair, just and a complete vindication." [...] David Steel, on behalf of the Liberal Party, welcomed the verdict as [...] "a great relief", and hoped that Thorpe would, [...] "after a suitable period of rest and recuperation... find many avenues where his great talents may be used." [...] In North Devon [...] Thorpe's acquittal was celebrated with a thanksgiving service at which the presiding vicar, The Rev. John Hornby, gave <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God</b> [...] "for the ministry of His servant Jeremy...The darkness is now past and the true light shines. This is the day the Lord hath made! Now is the day of our salvation!" ...|$|E
500|$|Messi and Roccuzzo {{have two}} sons: Thiago (born 2012) and Mateo (born 2015). To {{celebrate}} his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy {{in an interview}} two weeks later. Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012, with Messi attending the birth after being given permission by Barcelona to miss training. He announced his son's arrival on his Facebook page, writing, [...] "Today I am the happiest man in the world, my son was born and <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God</b> for this gift!" [...] Thiago's name and handprints are tattooed on his left calf. In April 2015, Messi confirmed on Facebook that they were expecting another child. He missed training ahead of a match against Atlético Madrid to attend {{the birth of his}} second son, Mateo, on 11 September 2015 in Barcelona. On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario with about 260 guests attending his wedding. On 15 October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child in an Instagram post, with the words [...] "Family of 5".|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} Kossowski began to pray, [...] " [...] … because when I was so deep in this {{calamity}} and nearly dead I promised myself that if I {{came out of}} this subhuman land I would tender my <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God.</b> I hesitate to call it a vow, it was rather a promise to myself but later I used to think that it was my obligation …" ...|$|E

2500|$|Harrison biographer Simon Leng {{notes that}} musically the song {{reflects}} [...] "many years' flipping of Atlantic and Stax classics" [...] by Harrison, {{as well as}} his work over 1969–70 with two soul/R artists signed to the Beatles' Apple record label, Billy Preston and Doris Troy. Christian theologian Dale Allison describes [...] "Pure Smokey" [...] as a [...] "prayer of <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God</b> for the music of Smokey Robinson".|$|E
2500|$|The closing chorale, [...] "" [...] (Praise and <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God,</b> who did {{not permit}} that their maw might seize us.), is a four-part setting with [...] "contrapuntally {{animated}} bass and middle voices", similar to the chorales of the Christmas Oratorio, first performed a few weeks before. Wolff summarizes the maturity of Bach's late church cantatas caused by [...] "the experience accumulated by the composer between 1723 and 1729, which lends the later cantatas an especial ripe character".|$|E
2500|$|The Shafi'i scholar Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d 852 A.H.) too {{approved}} of the Mawlid and states that:As for what is performed {{on the day of}} the Mawlid, one should limit oneself to what expresses <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>God,</b> such as the things that have already been mentioned: [...] recitation, serving food, alms-giving, and recitation of praise [...] about the Prophet – may God bless him and grant him peace – and asceticism which motivate people to perform good deeds and act in view of the next world.|$|E
