5|$|In 1801, Guinness West India Porter, {{the direct}} {{predecessor}} of Foreign Extra Stout, was first exported from the St. James's Gate brewery in Dublin.

To survive the long journey overseas, which was <b>then</b> <b>taken</b> by ship, it was brewed with extra hops and a higher alcohol content, which acted as natural preservatives for the beer. Exported in barrels, the product was then bottled locally, which helped to reduce costs.|$|E
