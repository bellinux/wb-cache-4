5|$|Dog racing was {{originally}} {{an extension of}} hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated {{were said to be}} 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> would race towards their owners, who were standing {{at the opposite end of}} the track waving towels.|$|E

Mike (Tony Hirst) and Kathy Barnes (Sarah Jane Buckley) struggled to cope with Kathy's pregnancy, as the two were still teenagers at the <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> discussed putting her up for adoption, although Mike then became attached to Sarah after her birth and the couple decided to keep her when Mike realised {{that he wanted to}} be a father after all.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, a {{redistribution}} divided Whitlam's electorate of Werriwa in two, {{with his}} Cronulla home {{located in the}} new electorate of Hughes. Although Whitlam would have received ALP support in either division, he chose to continue standing for Werriwa and moved from Cronulla to Cabramatta. This meant even longer journeys for his older children to attend school, since neither electorate had a high school at the <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> attended school in Sydney.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Prosaurolophus was {{studied with}} other hadrosaurids by Wagner. The genus, along with Corythosaurus and Maiasaura, were {{considered}} by Wagner to be synonymous with Saurolophus, Hypacrosaurus and Brachylophosaurus respectively. Prosaurolophus maximus was reassigned to Saurolophus as S. maximus. The same year however, Prosaurolophus {{was found to}} be distinct from Saurolophus, in an analysis of Hu et al.. Their analysis was unique from any of the <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> recovered Prosaurolophus in Saurolophinae, with Saurolophus, Lophorhothon, Tsintaosaurus, Jaxartosaurus, and Kritosaurus. No other analysis has recovered this group of dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|In March 1866, a {{month after}} the fall, Eddy and her husband (then married for 13 years) moved into an unfurnished room in Lynn. At some point her husband left and Eddy was evicted, unable to pay the $1.50 weekly rent. He appears to have {{returned}} briefly—they moved to a boarding house in July, and in August he paid Dr. Cushing's bill from the fall—but the marriage was over. He sent her $200 a year for a <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> divorced in 1873.|$|E

5|$|Applewhite {{attended}} Corpus Christi High School and Austin College; at {{the latter}} school, he {{was active in}} several student organizations and was moderately religious. He earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1952 and subsequently enrolled at Union Presbyterian Seminary to study theology, hoping to become a minister. He married Anne Pearce around that <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> later had two children. Early in his seminary studies, he {{decided to leave the}} school to pursue a career in music, becoming the music director of a Presbyterian church in North Carolina. He was a baritone singer and enjoyed spirituals and the music of Handel. In 1954, he was drafted by the United States Army and served in Austria and New Mexico {{as a member of the}} Army Signal Corps.

5|$|During {{most of the}} Cold War, NATO's watch {{against the}} Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact did not {{actually}} lead to direct military action. On 1July 1968, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons opened for signature: NATO argued that its nuclear sharing arrangements did not breach the treaty as US forces controlled the weapons until {{a decision was made}} to go to war, at which point the treaty would no longer be controlling. Few states knew of the NATO nuclear sharing arrangements at that <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were not challenged. In May 1978, NATO countries officially defined two complementary aims of the Alliance, to maintain security and pursue détente. This was supposed to mean matching defences at the level rendered necessary by the Warsaw Pact's offensive capabilities without spurring a further arms race.|$|E
5|$|Eddie {{takes on}} the {{appearance}} of Mulder and visits Nelligan, showing her a photo of Eddie. Nelligan tells him that she went out with him in high school, but views him as rather a loser lacking in any drive or ambition. The disappointed Eddie leaves, just as the real Mulder shows up. Realizing that Eddie just visited Nelligan in his guise, Mulder searches for him down the hospital corridors. He finds the fertility doctor and a security guard nearby and handcuffs them to each other, believing {{one of them to}} be Eddie. The real Eddie, however, is hiding in a vent above. He gets the jump on Mulder and locks him up in the hospital basement. Eddie takes Mulder's form and tells Scully that he feels the case is a waste of <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> should return to Washington.|$|E

5|$|LeDuc's {{next stop}} was in Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF), where he resumed teaming with Paul LeDuc. Wrestling {{under the name}} The Canadian Lumberjacks, they were soon pushed to win the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship in December 1973 by {{defeating}} Dusty Rhodes and Dick Slater. They defended the belts for two months before dropping them to Slater and his new partner Stan Vachon, a kayfabe brother of the Vachons from Montreal. This was the final time the LeDuc's held a title together, as Paul LeDuc sustained a legitimate injury that forced Jos to wrestle without him. Jos LeDuc also wrestled as a singles competitor in Florida. He was booked to win the NWA Florida Southern Heavyweight Championship by defeating Rhodes in late 1973. He dropped the title to Rhodes in January 1974, however. LeDuc and Rhodes were placed in a heated feud at this <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> frequently faced each other in Death matches.|$|E

5|$|On June 2, 1775, Jones' ships {{arrived in}} the port at Machias. However, they were met with {{resistance}} from the townspeople when Jones refused to sell his pork and flour unless {{he was allowed to}} load lumber for Boston. In a meeting on June 6, 1775, the townspeople voted against doing business with Jones. The hostile climate forced Jones to take action by ordering Moore to bring the Margaretta within firing distance of the town. The threat prompted the townspeople to meet for a second <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> voted to permit trade. The Unity was docked at the wharf to begin unloading the supplies.|$|E

5|$|The Enterprise {{is called}} to Deep Space Station K7 by a {{distress}} call. It is near Sherman's Planet, a world whose ownership is under dispute between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. On arrival, Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) becomes furious when he finds out {{the reason for the}} distress call, which was made by station manager Lurry (Whit Bissell) by the orders of Nilz Baris (William Schallert), the Undersecretary of Agriculture for the sector: Baris wants someone to guard the shipments of quadrotriticale (related to triticale) grain bound for Sherman's Planet, since quadrotriticale is the only Earth grain that would grow on Sherman's Planet and thus is required to resolve the ownership issue. Kirk assigns two crewmen to guard the grain, but afterwards learns that Starfleet Command share Baris' concerns. In addition, a Klingon ship commanded by Captain Koloth (William Campbell) arrives, who requests permission for his crew to board K7 for shore leave. Kirk agrees, but limits the number of Klingons at any one <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> must travel under Starfleet guard while on the station.|$|E

5|$|The novel Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk was {{published}} in 1996. Before its publication, a 20th Century Fox book scout sent a galley proof of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof {{as a candidate for}} a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers Lawrence Bender and Art Linson, who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to Laura Ziskin, head of the division Fox 2000, who listened to the tape and purchased the rights to Fight Club from Palahniuk for $10,000.|$|E

5|$|Last Light {{title was}} first leaked as Metro 2034, a name used by 4A Games internally. THQ officially {{revealed}} the actual title in May 2012. In November 2012, THQ {{announced that it}} had delayed the game's release until March 2013 {{in order to give}} the development team more time to polish the game further. In December 2012, the game's original publisher, THQ, entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Metro: Last Light, along with other THQ properties and studios, went to auction on 22 January 2013. GameStop temporarily removed the game from its store to prevent customers from being misled by the game's uncertain release, The auction did not affect the progress of the game's development significantly. Clearlake and Koch Media, the latter of which was originally set to distribute the title in Italy and Spain, participated in the auction. Koch Media eventually acquired the rights to the Metro franchise for $5.9 million. Koch was interested in the title as the game was already playable at the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were familiar with the development team, whose members worked on , a game published by Koch Media's label Deep Silver. After the auction, Deep Silver announced that the title would be released on 14 May 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
