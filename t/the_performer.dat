5|$|The accompaniment for a Peking opera {{performance}} usually {{consists of}} a small ensemble of traditional melodic and percussion instruments. The lead melodic instrument is the jinghu, a small, high-pitched, two-string spike fiddle. The jinghu is the primary accompaniment for performers during songs. Accompaniment is heterophonic – the jinghu player follows the basic contours of the song's melody, but diverges in pitch and other elements. The jinghu often plays more notes per measure than <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> sings, and does so an octave lower. During rehearsal, the jinghu player adopts {{his or her own}} signature version of the song's melody, but also must adapt to spontaneous improvisations on the part of <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> due to changed performance conditions. Thus, the jinghu player must have an instinctive ability to change his or her performance without warning to properly accompany <b>the</b> <b>performer.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Scottish Highlands, {{there are}} dances that used the Lochaber axe, the broadsword, targe & dirk, and the flail. The Highland Dirk Dance, resembles a combative dance {{similar to those}} of Indonesian pencak silat, which has <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> {{executing}} knife techniques combined with wrestling style kicks, trips, and sweeps.|$|E
5|$|The 21 nocturnes {{are more}} structured, and of greater {{emotional}} depth, {{than those of}} Field (whom Chopin met in 1833). Many of the Chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression (and often making very difficult demands on <b>the</b> <b>performer)</b> which heightens their dramatic character.|$|E

These range from theme park [...] "walk-around" [...] or [...] "meetable" [...] characters, the mascots of corporations, schools, or sports teams to novelty act performers.

5|$|Hendrix {{received}} several prestigious rock music awards {{during his lifetime}} and posthumously. In 1967, readers of Melody Maker voted him the Pop Musician of the Year. In 1968, Rolling Stone declared him <b>the</b> <b>Performer</b> of the Year. Also in 1968, the City of Seattle gave him the Keys to the City. Disc & Music Echo newspaper honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970 Guitar Player magazine named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year.|$|E
25|$|Since chance {{procedures}} {{were used by}} Cage to eliminate the composer's and <b>the</b> <b>performer's</b> likes and dislikes from music, Cage disliked the concept of improvisation, which is inevitably linked to <b>the</b> <b>performer's</b> preferences. In a number of works beginning in the 1970s, he found ways to incorporate improvisation. In Child of Tree (1975) and Branches (1976) <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> are asked to use certain species of plants as instruments, for example the cactus. The structure of the pieces is determined through the chance of their choices, as is the musical output; <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> {{had no knowledge of}} the instruments. In Inlets (1977) <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> play large water-filled conch shells – by carefully tipping the shell several times, it is possible to achieve a bubble forming inside, which produced sound. Yet, as it is impossible to predict when this would happen, <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> had to continue tipping the shells – as a result the performance was dictated by pure chance.|$|R

5|$|In the {{original}} album credits, Harrison {{was listed as}} producer, writer and arranger but was not included among the performers, leading to an assumption {{that he did not}} play on the recordings. After consulting Barham in 2002 for his book While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Leng credited Harrison as a performing musician, and Spizer also recognised him in his track-by-track list, published in 2005. <b>The</b> <b>performer</b> credits in the 2014 reissue of Wonderwall Music rectified the situation, and list Harrison on piano and guitar.|$|E

5|$|The mascot of the Houston Rockets in the 1980s {{was called}} Booster. From 1993 to 1995, the mascot was Turbo, a costumed man that {{performed}} acrobatic dunks and other maneuvers. In 1995, the Rockets debuted Clutch the Bear {{as a second}} mascot, a large teddy bear-like mascot that performs a variety of acts during the games. After eight years of serving as dual mascots, <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> playing Turbo retired, making Clutch the sole mascot for the team.|$|E

50|$|A {{traveling}} fair {{arrives and}} sets up camp directly {{next to the}} Kirrin Children. The children attempt {{to make friends with}} <b>the</b> <b>performers,</b> <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> do not feel <b>the</b> same way. <b>Performers</b> include Alfredo <b>the</b> Fire-Eater, Buffalo the Whip Cracker and his assistant Skippy, Mr India Rubber, and Mr. Slither, the snake man. The tension between <b>the</b> children and <b>performers</b> finally culminates in <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> waiting until <b>the</b> children have gone for a walk and then hitch up their own horses to the children's caravans to move them to another field. The field that the caravans have been moved to is owned by a farmer who orders the children off his property. Unfortunately, the Kirrin's are unable to move their caravans without borrowing horses from <b>the</b> <b>performers.</b> Julian and Dick leave to speak to <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> but are unsuccessful in their attempts to borrow the horses. During this time, their old friend Jo (first introduced in Five Fall into Adventure) arrives and joins the Kirrin children. Jo aids Julian and Dick in convincing <b>the</b> fair <b>performers</b> to let them borrow their horses.|$|R

5|$|There {{has also}} been a general feeling of a shift in the {{creative}} attribution of Peking-opera works. <b>The</b> <b>performer</b> has traditionally played a large role in the scripting and staging of Peking-opera works. However, perhaps following the lead of the West, Peking opera in recent decades has shifted to a more director and playwright centered model. Performers have striven to introduce innovation in their work while heeding the call for reform from this new upper level of Peking-opera producers.|$|E
40|$|In {{this open}} rehearsal. <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> work on {{developing}} {{an interpretation of}} Rachmaninoff's sonata for cello and piano in G minor Op. 1. Neither of <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> played <b>the</b> piece before, and prior to the workshop they had two private rehearsals. Among research questions posed are: - What kind of musical information does the score provide, {{and what kinds of}} knowledge do performers employ in interpreting the score? - How prescriptive is the musical score and how much room does it leave for creative decisions? - What are the cognitive and affective processes that <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> go through as they formulate their conception of a chamber-music piece and create a performance interpretation? - How do <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> resolve issues of textural balance and synchronisation? - What role do images, metaphors and narratives play in the process of creating a performance interpretation? Can these be considered as analytical tools employed by performers? - How do <b>the</b> <b>performers</b> conceptualise <b>the</b> relationship between rehearsal and public performance...|$|R

5|$|A bicycle kick's {{successful}} performance generally requires great {{skill and}} athleticism. <b>The</b> <b>performer</b> needs to maintain good form when executing the move, and must simultaneously exhibit exceptional {{accuracy and precision}} when striking the ball. Sports historian Richard Witzig recommends that footballers attempt executing a bicycle kick with a focused and determined state of mind. Due to the action's complexity, a successfully executed bicycle kick is notable and, according to sports journalist Elliott Turner, prone to awe audiences. Brazilian forward Pelé, one of the sport's renowned players, also considers the manoeuvre difficult and recalled having scored from it {{only a few times}} out of his 1,283 career goals.|$|E

5|$|The film co-produced by The Muppets Studio, Touchstone Television, and Fox Television Studios, in {{association}} with The Jim Henson Company. Right after Disney bought the rights to The Muppets in 2004, pre-production on The Muppets' Wizard of Oz took place throughout February 2004, and filming occurred during September 2004. ABC made several changes to the film after the initial script was written, ultimately deciding to adapt plot elements from Baum's original novel rather than the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film, The Wizard of Oz. As with the preceding Muppet films, The Muppets' Wizard of Oz became a musical, and included five new songs written and composed by Michael Giacchino. The production marked the feature film debut of Eric Jacobson as <b>the</b> <b>performer</b> of Sam Eagle, a character originally performed by Frank Oz.|$|E
5|$|Alongside his collaborations with Dada artists {{on various}} pieces, Tzara {{himself was a}} subject for visual artists. Max Ernst depicts him as the only mobile {{character}} in the Dadaists' group portrait Au Rendez-vous des Amis ("A Friends' Reunion", 1922), while, in one of Man Ray's photographs, he is shown kneeling to kiss the hand of an androgynous Nancy Cunard. Years before their split, Francis Picabia used Tzara's calligraphed name in Moléculaire ("Molecular"), a composition printed {{on the cover of}} 391. The same artist also completed his schematic portrait, which showed a series of circles connected by two perpendicular arrows. In 1949, Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti made Tzara the subject of one of his first experiments with lithography. Portraits of Tzara were also made by Greta Knutson, Robert Delaunay, and the Cubist painters M. H. Maxy and Lajos Tihanyi. As an homage to Tzara <b>the</b> <b>performer,</b> art rocker David Bowie adopted his accessories and mannerisms during a number of public appearances. In 1996, he was depicted on a series of Romanian stamps, and, the same year, a concrete and steel monument dedicated to the writer was erected in Moinești.|$|E
5|$|In the game's primary single-player mode, titled GH Live {{within the}} game, the player completes songs while {{experiencing}} full-motion video {{taken from the}} first-person perspective of a band's lead guitarist. The video includes shots of the audience and the band members. As the player performs the songs, the audience responds positively to good performances when few mistakes are made. If the player makes several mistakes in a row, the audience will become critical and start to jeer at <b>the</b> <b>performer.</b> To win back the crowd, the player can either match more notes correctly, or can use collected Hero Power to rapidly regain their interest. Hero Power, replacing Star Power from previous Guitar Hero games, is collected by correctly playing marked series of notes on the track; Hero Power can be accumulated, marked as on-screen guitar picks next to the track, to be used at later times. The player can release Hero Power for a limited time by either tilting the guitar controller upward or hitting a special button on the controller.|$|E
