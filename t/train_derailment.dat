The cast members often rehearsed with each other for better on-screen chemistry. Filming concluded in July but due to negative reception towards the ending in early screenings, a new ending sequence featuring a subway <b>train</b> <b>derailment</b> was filmed in November.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southwest}} corner of the same intersection, the building housing Sidetrack Bar & Grillwhich has held a bar and restaurant continuously since at least 1850has an unusual shape resulting from a 1929 <b>train</b> <b>derailment.</b> On an early January morning, the twelfth car, laden with lumber, of an 85-car freight train came off the tracks and crashed into the corner of the building. The owner of the building, who lived just above the section that was hit, was uninjured but had most of her personal effects scattered into the street. There were only a few people near the railroad crossing when it derailed including an 18-year-old female who was knocked unconscious and a man who was sitting in his car, but was able to get away unharmed. When the current owners went to build a patio on the spot, they found some of the debris had been piled up underneath, which made it more difficult to dig post holes. In 1931, the entrance to the building was moved from the east side to its current position on the north side to accommodate a post-prohibition law requiring bar entrances to be at least 500 feet from any church. The back patio was constructed after the nearby church burned down. According to Sidetrack owner Linda French, the first-floor walls are three bricks deep, with the oldest remaining bricks dating to the 1850s.|$|E

40|$|Aurizon is Australia’s largest {{rail freight}} {{operator}} with over 150 years of experience. Each day {{the company is}} responsible for the movement of about 700, 000 tonnes of coal, iron ore and other freight across Australia. Among the challenges, track buckling has been a major hurdle to overcome. Compressive stress in the hot weather periods has historically caused rails to misalign, causing delays to services, reputational impact on the coal business, and significant financial stresses on the track maintainer and budget holder. Ultimately, in a number of cases, it has also caused tracks to buckle under trains and been the direct cause of <b>train</b> <b>derailments.</b> The use in the field of using an artificial thermal method of heating rail upon installation has been deemed as a major factor and a root cause of future problems occurring. Track buckling and heat related track misalignments {{over the last five years}} have shown a significant increase. Goals are to manage and control the causes of track buckling with the aim of delivering zero <b>train</b> <b>derailments.</b> This paper explains the basic fundamentals of how to manage rail stress in a modern railway infrastructure, the consequences of not managing rail stress in extreme temperatures, and simple processes required to re-stress rails, it discusses easy methods to have knowledge of problem locations that require speed restrictions to be imposed...|$|R
