5|$|Billy Talent II hit {{the shelves}} on June 27, 2006. It fared {{very well in}} Canada in its debut week, landing in at number 1 on the Canadian charts. It also enjoyed {{significant}} success in Germany, where it also debuted at number 1 in the album charts in its debut week, {{and was one of}} the top 10 selling albums in the country. As of June 15, 2007, the album has sold almost 700,000 units worldwide, 215,000 of them in Canada making it certified 2x Platinum, and 200,000 shipped units in Germany achieved it platinum status there. However, the success did not duplicate itself in the U.S. The band has expressed that they know they are a new band <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> are choosing to concentrate their attention on Canada, Europe, and other places overseas instead.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} of the 3rd Battalion, 27th Infantry, to hold the high knob on Battle Mountain after its attacks on September 8 and 9, the 24th Infantry stopped trying to retake Battle Mountain. K Company, 24th Infantry, and C Company, 65th Engineer Combat Battalion, dug in on the hill east of and beneath Battle Mountain, {{fortified}} their position with barbed wire and mine fields, and placed registered artillery and mortar fires on all approaches to the position. The regimental commander planned to contain the North Koreans on Battle Mountain by artillery and mortar fire. The North Koreans on Battle Mountain attacked the lower American defensive position many times on subsequent nights, but all their attacks were driven off. After a month of almost constant battle the North Koreans gained and held possession of the crest of Battle Mountain. The defensive fires of the 24th Regiment and attached artillery, however, contained them <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were unable to exploit the possession on the peak or attack further.|$|E
25|$|Denmark's {{two biggest}} cities, Copenhagen and Aarhus, are about 300km apart, {{and there is}} a {{political}} target to reach a two-hour traveling time, and 200km/h is set as a target speed. Some parts are planned to be rerouted because the present railway is curvy <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> are likely to be designed for higher than 200km/h.|$|E

In short, I am going to live there myself." ...|$|R

25|$|He had met Florence Mary Bentley {{when he was}} {{studying}} at Rochester. Since state-side leave was not authorized for junior diplomats, he arranged an administrative trip to Yokohama, Japan in 1915. Florence joined him <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were married. The Prices spent the next 15 years in China where all five of their children were born.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Spanish had {{different}} reasons {{for wanting to}} find the colony. Knowing of Raleigh's plans to use Roanoke {{as a base for}} privateering, they were hoping to destroy it. Moreover, they had been getting mostly inaccurate reports of activities <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> imagined the colony to be far more successful than it actually was.|$|E
25|$|Australia and New Zealand have jointly {{agreed to}} {{fortification}} though the Food Standards Australia New Zealand. Australia will fortify all flour from 18 September 2009. Although the food standard covers both Australia and New Zealand, an Australian government official has stated {{it is up}} to New Zealand to decide whether to implement it <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> will watch with interest.|$|E

25|$|Jackie Ormes married {{accountant}} Earl Ormes in 1936. The couple initially {{moved to}} Salem, Ohio so Earl {{could be close}} to his family. But Ormes was not happy <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> eventually moved back to Chicago. The pair had one child, Jaqueline, who died of a brain aneurysm at age 3. Ormes would remain married to Earl {{until his death in}} 1976.|$|E
25|$|Tension {{between the}} forest {{tradition}} and the Thammayut administrative hierarchy escalated in 1926, when Tisso Uan attempted to drive a senior Forest Tradition monk named Ajaan Sing — along with his following of 50 monks and 100 nuns and laypeople — out of Ubon, which was under Tisso Uan's jurisdiction. Ajaan Sing refused, saying he {{and many of his}} supporters were born <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> weren't doing anything to harm anyone. After arguing with district officials the directive was eventually dropped.|$|E
25|$|The {{body was}} carried to Jannat al-Baqi, the Muslim graveyard. It {{appeared}} {{that some people}} gathered <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> resisted the burial of Uthman in the graveyard of the Muslims. The supporters of Uthman insisted that the body should be buried in Jannat al-Baqi. They later buried him in the Jewish graveyard behind Jannat al-Baqi. Some decades later, the Umayyad rulers demolished the wall separating the two cemeteries and merged the Jewish cemetery into the Muslim one to ensure that his tomb was now inside a Muslim cemetery.|$|E

25|$|The {{next day}} Scottie follows Madeleine; they meet {{and spend the}} day together. They travel to Muir Woods and Cypress Point on 17-Mile Drive, where Madeleine runs down towards the ocean. Scottie grabs her and they embrace. Madeleine recounts a {{nightmare}} and Scottie identifies its setting as Mission San Juan Bautista, childhood home of Carlotta. He drives her <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> express their love for each other. Madeleine suddenly runs into the church and up the bell tower. Scottie, halted on the steps by his acrophobia, sees Madeleine plunge to her death.|$|E
25|$|They are not {{reduced to}} ashes <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> do not die of their {{enormous}} pains; undergoing this punishment, the miserable men suffer for their misdeeds. And {{there in the}} place, where there is constant shivering, they resort to a large burning fire; but they find no relief in that place of torture; the tormentors torture them still. There is heard everywhere the noise of painfully uttered cries even as in the street of a town. Those whose bad Karman takes effect (viz. the punishers), violently torment again and again those whose bad Karman takes effect also (viz. the punished).|$|E
25|$|In the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), males {{sometimes}} {{see their}} nest full of eggs {{fall prey to}} groups of marauding females; some males, {{when they see a}} group of females approaching, swim away from their nest and start poking their snout into the substrate, as would a female raiding a nest. This distraction display commonly fools the females into behaving as if a nest has been discovered <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> rush to that site, leaving the male's real nest alone. Bowfin (Amia calva) males caring for their free-swimming fry exhibit a related distraction display when a potential fry-predator approaches; they move away and thrash about as if injured, drawing the predator's attention toward himself.|$|E
50|$|Martha happily embraces her new {{environment}} and friendly neighbors, but Ben is cynical about their life <b>there</b> <b>and</b> decides <b>they</b> should return to the city.

25|$|The team endured {{numerous}} {{changes in}} 1990, losing Sam Perkins to the Lakers via free agency and suffering injuries to practically their entire 1990–91 starting lineup. The players {{they managed to}} acquire—Rodney McCray, Fat Lever and Alex English—were all in the twilight of their careers. On November 9 {{it was announced that}} Fat Lever would have season-ending surgery on his right knee, and that very night, Tarpley suffered a knee injury of his own which ended his season. The Mavericks' season only got worse from <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> finished with a record of 28–54, falling behind even the second-year Minnesota Timberwolves and Orlando Magic. In March 1991, Tarpley was charged with suspicion of driving while intoxicated and was suspended again by the NBA.|$|E
25|$|An {{area was}} {{set aside for}} the burial of Confederate prisoners of war who died at the camp. As many as 700 prisoners died in 1862 when {{smallpox}} and other diseases were rampant in the camp. The situation was aggravated by the poor living conditions the prisoners endured <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were interred in the cemetery in their own Confederate section. A total of 866 Confederate prisoner's graves can be found today in the National Cemetery. The Confederate graves are easily distinguishable by the pointed headstones, which were instituted under the superstition that it was a means of preventing the devil from sitting on their graves. They are buried side by side with 776 graves of Union soldiers and enlistees, making a total of 1,642 Civil War graves.|$|E
25|$|After the Sasanian Empire was conquered by Muslim Arabs in 644, {{the newly}} {{established}} Rashidun Caliphate designated the Church of the East as an official dhimmi minority group headed by the Patriarch of the East. As with all other Christian and Jewish groups given the same status, the Church was restricted within the Caliphate, but also given a degree of protection. Nestorians were not permitted to proselytise or attempt to convert Muslims, but their missionaries were otherwise given a free hand, and they increased missionary efforts farther afield. Missionaries established dioceses in India (the Saint Thomas Christians). They made some advances in Egypt, despite the strong Monophysite presence <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> entered Central Asia, where they had significant success converting local Tartars. Nestorian missionaries were firmly established in China during {{the early part of}} the Tang dynasty (618–907); the Chinese source known as the Nestorian Stele describes a mission under a proselyte named Alopen as introducing Nestorian Christianity to China in 635. In the 7th century, the Church had grown to have two Nestorian archbishops, and over 20 bishops east of the Iranian border of the Oxus River.|$|E

500|$|At {{the early}} stages of filming, stars Connelly and Bowie found it {{difficult}} to interact naturally with the puppets they shared most of their scenes with. Bowie told Movieline [...] "I had some initial problems working with Hoggle and the rest because, for one thing, what they say doesn't come from their mouths, but {{from the side of the}} set, or from behind you." [...] Connelly remarked, [...] "it was a bit strange , but I think both Dave [...] and I got over that and just took it as a challenge to work with these puppets. And by the end of the film, it wasn't a challenge anymore. They were <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were their characters." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{criticism}} towards Moore's Boston accent in the series, executive producer Robert Carlock, {{who is from}} Boston, defended Moore. In an interview with New York magazine, Carlock said, [...] "I grew up with people like that. Not everyone talks like that in Boston, but I think she's enough of an actress to pull it off." [...] When asked if her accent [...] "sounded realistic", he noted, [...] "I'm {{going to go with}} that. I know people who sound like that." [...] In response to the accent, Moore explained [...] "I went to school in Boston and worked with a lot of guys from Dorchester, so that's where [...] came from. We made it thick... for humor's sake, but then again, not really. There are folks with seriously heavy accents <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> are proud of it." ...|$|E
500|$|A major {{point of}} {{criticism}} the film faced was regarding {{the possibility of}} Army attacking students in a radio station. When Rakeysh was questioned about the same in a scriptwriter's conference conducted by the Film Writers Association in the year 2008, he said the following, [...] "So, in 2005, in Allahabad, a bunch of 4 students took the TV station <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were shot dead. Everything I did, {{it was kind of}} was kind of borrowed, as I said right here. Obviously, what I am also learning is the way I tell a story is not real; you can term it as a-real. For maximum impact, for the message to go through, I felt—since the story was against the establishment—let the establishment do it. After all, the establishment did hang Bhagat Singh. After all, the establishment did come down on the innocent, innocent students in Mandal Commission. After all the establishment did come down on Tiananmen Square. After all the establishment did come down when the whole concept of Flower Power emerged in America. So it's all there. It's borrowed, maybe not as realistically, but it is definitely there in the society. During emergency, there are horror stories. If {{we have to go back}} to Kriplani and his movement in Bihar, the stories are absolutely horrific." ...|$|E
