5000|$|The {{spray angle}} diverges or converges {{with respect to}} the {{vertical}} axis. As illustrated in the figure below, the spray angle tends to collapse or diverge with increasing distance from the orifice. Spray coverage varies with spray angle. The <b>theoretical</b> <b>coverage,</b> C, of spray patterns at various distances may be calculated with the equation below for spray angles less than 180 degrees. The spray angle is assumed to remain constant throughout the entire spray distance. Liquids more viscous than water form smaller spray angles, or solid streams, depending upon nozzle capacity, spray pressure, and viscosity. Liquids with surface tensions lower than water produce wider spray angles than those listed for water. Spray angles are typically measured using optical or mechanical methods. The optical methods include shadowgraphy, extinction tomography, and Mie Imaging. [...] Sprays angles are important in coating applications to prevent overspraying of the coated materials, in combustion engines to prevent wetting of the cylinder walls, and in fire sprinklers to provide adequate coverage of the protected property.|$|E

We compare both the <b>theoretical</b> <b>coverage</b> and the empirical performance of these methods using data from Czech, English and German. The results show that although online reordering is the only method with complete <b>theoretical</b> <b>coverage,</b> all three techniques exhibit high precision but somewhat lower recall on non-projective dependencies and can all improve overall parsing accuracy provided that non-projective dependencies are frequent enough. We also find that the use of non-adjacent arc transitions may lead to a drop in accuracy on projective dependencies in the presence of long-distance non-projective dependencies, an effect that is not found for the two other techniques...|$|E

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and the distribution of serogroups and serotypes in children aged 3 - 36 months attending day care centres in Belgium. A single nasopharyngeal swab was cultured from 467 children attending 30 different day care centres between December 2000 and March 2001. S. pneumoniae isolates were serotyped and their antibiotic susceptibilities assessed by disk diffusion. The overall nasopharyngeal carriage rate for S. pneumoniae was 21 % in the 467 children. None of the commonly accepted risk factors studied was associated significantly with carriage. Capsular serotypes isolated were 19 F (27. 3 %), 6 B (20. 2 %), 23 F (19. 2 %), 19 A (10. 1 %), 6 A (7. 1 %), 14 (5. 1 %) and others (11. 0 %). <b>Theoretical</b> <b>coverage</b> by the seven-valent (serotypes 4, 6 B, 9 V, 14, 18 C, 19 F and 23 F) pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was 73. 7 %.

40|$|Little {{attention}} has been paid to pneumococcal carriage and disease in Amerindians from Latin America. The Warao people, an indigenous population from Venezuela, live in the delta of the Orinoco River in geographically isolated communities with difficult access to medical care. To obtain insight into pneumococcal carriage and the <b>theoretical</b> <b>coverage</b> of pneumococcal vaccines in this population, we investigated pneumococcal colonization, serotype, and genotype distribution among Warao children in 9 distinct, geographically isolated communities in the Delta Amacuro area in the northeast of Venezuela. From April 2004 through January 2005, a total of 161 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were recovered from single nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from 356 children aged 0 - 72 months. The overall pneumococcal carriage rate was 49 %, ranging from 13 % to 76 %, depending on the community investigated and the age of the children (50 % among children aged 2 years). The most frequent serotypes were 23 F (19. 5 % of isolates), 6 A (19. 5 %), 15 B (10. 4 %), 6 B (9. 1 %), and 19 F (7. 2 %). The <b>theoretical</b> <b>coverage</b> of the 7 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, including the cross-reactive nonvaccine serotype 6 A, was 65 %. A total of 26 % of the isolates were resistant to first-line antibiotics, with 70 % of these strains being covered by the 7 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Restriction fragment end labelling analysis revealed 65 different genotypes, with 125 (80 %) of the isolates belonging to 27 different genetic clusters, suggesting a high degree of horizontal spread of pneumococcal strains in and between the villages.

Scanning electron microscopy along with electrochemical characterisation showed sample conductivity, mechanical stability, and high surface area of the thus fabricated devices, viz. 10 times higher electrochemically active surface area compared to the geometric area. The three-dimensional gold coated silicon chips were further modified with thiol layers, followed by immobilisation of a simple copper-containing redox protein, azurin, or a complex multicopper redox enzyme, laccase.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability of}} a food ingredient, sodium stearoyllactylate (SSL), to {{stabilise}} oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions against coalescence was investigated, and closely linked to its capacity {{to act as a}} Pickering stabiliser. Results showed that emulsion stability could be achieved with a relatively low SSL concentration (⩾ 0. 1 wt%), and cryogenic-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) visualisation of emulsion structure revealed the presence of colloidal SSL aggregates adsorbed at the oil–water interface. Surface properties of SSL could be modified by altering the size of these aggregates in water; a faster decrease in surface tension was observed when SSL dispersions were subjected to high pressure homogenisation (HPH). The rate of SSL adsorption at the sunflower oil–water interface also increased after HPH, and a higher interfacial tension (IFT) was observed with increasing SSL concentration. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) enabled a comparison of the thermal behaviour of SSL in aqueous dispersions with SSL-stabilised O/W emulsions. SSL melting enthalpy depended on emulsion interfacial area and the corresponding DSC data was used to determine the amount of SSL adsorbed at the oil–water interface. An idealised <b>theoretical</b> interfacial <b>coverage</b> calculation based on Pickering emulsion theory was in general agreement with the mass of SSL adsorbed as predicted by DSC...|$|R

In this study, adsorption of refractory thiophenic sulfur compounds, i. e., benzothiophene (BT), dibenzothiophene (DBT), and 4, 6 -dimethyldibenzothiophene (4, 6 -DMDBT) in single-solute systems from n-hexane solutions onto metal-impregnated activated carbons was investigated. A hydrogen-treated activated carbon fiber was selectively loaded with Ni, NiO, Cu, Cu 2 O, and CuO species to systematically assess the impact of each metal species on the adsorption of thiophenic compounds (TC). Metal-loaded adsorbents had the same total metal contents and similar microporosities, but contained different types of copper or nickel species. All metal-loaded adsorbents showed enhanced adsorption of tested TC. Cu 2 O- or NiO-loaded adsorbents exhibited the highest uptakes, due to more specific interactions between Cu+ or Ni 2 + species and TC molecules. The <b>theoretical</b> monolyer <b>coverage</b> of TC on the exposed Cu+ sites was estimated and compared with that calculated from the experimental data. Results suggested catalytic conversion of TC molecules to other compounds on the Cu+ sites, followed by adsorption of reaction products onto the carbon surface or multilayer accumulation of TC molecules on the Cu+sites.
