6000|$|A remark of {{a similar}} nature may be applied to most of those distinctions among propositions which {{are said to have}} {{reference}} to their modality; as, difference of tense or time; the sun did rise, the sun is rising, the sun will rise. These differences, like that between affirmation and negation, might be glossed over by considering the incident of time as a mere modification of the predicate: thus, The sun is an object having risen, The sun is an object now rising, The sun is an object to rise hereafter. But the simplification would be merely verbal. Past, present, and future, do not constitute so many different kinds of rising; they are designations belonging to the event asserted, to the sun’s rising to-day. They affect, not the predicate, but the applicability of the predicate to the particular subject. That which we affirm to be past, present, or future, is not what the subject signifies, nor what the predicate signifies, but specifically and expressly what the predication signifies; what is expressed only by the proposition as such, and not by either or both of the terms. Therefore the circumstance of time is properly considered as attaching to the copula, which is the sign of predication, and not to the predicate. If <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> said of such modifications as these, Cæsar may be dead; Cæsar is perhaps dead; it is possible that Cæsar is dead; it is only because these fall altogether under another head, being properly assertions not of any thing relating to the fact itself, but of the state of our own mind in regard to it; namely, our absence of disbelief of it. Thus “Cæsar may be dead” means “I am not sure that Cæsar is alive.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Regarding [...] "third" [...] variables, media {{violence}} {{researchers who}} argue for causal effects acknowledge that other variables {{may play a}} role in aggression (Bushman & Anderson, 2001) and that aggression is due to a confluence of variables. These variables are known as [...] "third variables" [...] and if found, would probably be mediator variables (which differ from moderator variables). A mediator variable could 'explain away' media violence effects, whereas a moderator variable cannot. For instance, some scholars contend that trait aggressiveness has been demonstrated to moderate media violence effects (Bushman), although in some studies [...] "trait aggression" [...] does appear to account for any link between media violence exposure and aggression. Other variables have also been found to moderate media violence effects (Bushman & Geen, 1990). Another issue is the way in which experimental studies deal with potential confounding variables. Researchers use random assignment to attempt to neutralize the effects of what commonly are cited as third variables (i.e. gender, trait aggressiveness, preference for violent media). Because experimental designs employ random assignment to conditions, the effect of such attributive variables on experimental results is assumed to be random (not systematic). However, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> said for correlational studies, and failure to control for such variables in correlational studies limits the interpretation of such studies.

40|$|Abstract— This paper {{deals with}} the design of {{permanent}} magnet (PM) motors for mechatronic systems requiring an imperative fault-tolerant capability. The PM motors {{are more and more}} used in many applications for their high torque density. However, for critical applications, the motor geometry has to be suitably designed to limit the maximum short–circuit currents and brake torque. In case of short–circuit, the PMs on the rotor induce an e. m. f. on the faulty phases. Thus, even redundant solutions with two motors placed on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> shaft <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be enough when PM motors are used. As a consequence, the PM quantity has to be reduced. In addition, some winding arrangements can be adopted to improve the fault–tolerant capability.

40|$|We {{examine the}} oblique {{correction}} phenomenology of one-family Technicolor with light pseudo-Goldstone bosons. From loop calculations {{based on a}} gauged chiral lagrangian for Technicolor, we are lead to conclude that even though loops with light Goldstone bosons give a negative contribution to S measured at the Z-pole, this effect is not sufficiently large to unambiguously counter the `S-argument' against one-family Technicolor. This result cannot be guessed, but must be explicitly calculated. Our analysis entails an extended version of the STU oblique parametrization of Peskin and Takeuchi. In principle, this extended formalism (STUVWX) must be used when there are light new particles in loops. Comment: We have considerably shortened this paper. The bulk of the derivation of the STUVWX formalism has been removed and will be presented elsewhere.
