5|$|Hindenburg never {{responded to}} the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as Otto Meißner, who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is {{noteworthy}} that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.|$|E

5|$|Suleiman {{said that}} he had come to protect John Sigismund's interests, but also {{announced}} that he wanted to see the infant king, because he had heard rumours about Isabella's having actually given birth to a daughter. Six Hungarian lords (including George Martinuzzi and Bálint Török) accompanied John Sigismund to the sultan's camp on 29August. During the meeting, janissaries entered Buda, saying that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the town. This {{turned out to be a}} trick that enabled them to seize the capital of Hungary without opposition. Bálint Török was captured in the sultan's camp. Suleiman declared that John Sigismund could retain the territories to the east of the river Tisza in exchange for a yearly tribute of 10,000 florins.|$|E

Pocket Gamer named it one of the best puzzle games for the system in 2008, and IGN ranked it 71st on its Top 100 Modern Games list in 2011.

5|$|The {{popularity}} of Rogue led developers {{to create their}} own versions of the game, though their efforts were originally limited by the lack of access to Rogues source, which was not released until BSD v4.3 in 1986. These developers resorted to building games from scratch similar to Rogue but with features that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> These versions would be distributed with source code, and along with the original Rogue source, other developers were able to create software forks of the games, adding in new monsters, items, and gameplay features, creating several dozen variants. This process was aided by switching code to languages with better data typing, including object-oriented and scripting languages, and cleaning up and modularizing the code so that contributors can better follow where changes can be made.|$|E

Before the last match, a poll was held on ROH's website, asking the fans if <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a third match between the two teams. Over 80% of respondents voted 'yes'. At Beating the Odds, they returned from a brief absence to score a pair of wins which were depicted in the storyline as being improbable, Mark over ROH veteran B.J. Whitmer and Jay in a Four Corner Survival match with ROH World Champion Samoa Joe, NWA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles, and Chris Sabin, pinning Sabin to earn a future title shot at Joe. At ROH's Maryland debut, Tradition Continues, Joe retained over Jay.|$|E

25|$|The street {{children}} in India choose {{to leave their}} families and homes for strategic reasons. Three hypotheses have been put forth {{in an attempt to}} explain their choices: urban poverty, aberrant families, and urbanization. Evidence can to some degree support all three of these hypotheses. In one study of 1,000 {{street children}} living in Bombay conducted in 1990, 39.1 percent of street children said they left home because of problems and fights with family, 20.9 percent said they left because of family poverty, and 3.6 percent said that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the city.|$|E
25|$|Štúr's notions (an {{autonomous}} Slovak area, a Slovak Diet (assembly), Slovak schools, etc.) came {{to fruition}} simultaneously with the 1848 Revolution in Hungary, which {{dealt with the}} liberation of peasants from serfdom and other national and ethnic issues. Hungarian revolutionaries called for Hungary’s separation from Vienna, {{but at the same}} time, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Hungary as one nation with one language and one educational system. But the desires of the Magyars for a centralized Hungarian state ran contrary to the wishes of other national groups, including the Slovaks.

25|$|The case Ashcroft v. ACLU {{started on}} January 11, 1999.

Opponents also held that legal speech would be made criminal by COPA, and that adults would be prevented from seeing legal content {{if they did not}} have a credit card to get past security screens. It was also argued that in some cases fully complying with COPA would not have guaranteed freedom from prosecution (Stevens) and that the plan was flawed because some minors do have their own credit cards, and could thus go around the screens with ease.|$|E

25|$|The Cine Club held {{a public}} {{demonstration}} on 12 June, {{which resulted in}} the formation of a joint committee supporting Suzuki against Nikkatsu. The committee was composed mostly of directors, actors, large student film groups and independent filmmakers. This also marked the first time the public became involved in a type of dispute normally confined to the industry. The Cine Club, and other similar groups, mobilized the public, holding panel discussions and leading mass demonstrations against the studio. The public support, garnered at the height of student movement, was based on a wide appreciation of Suzuki's films and the idea that audiences should {{be able to see the}} types of films <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> This shook the film industry by the fact that the public was making demands rather than passively accepting their product.|$|E
