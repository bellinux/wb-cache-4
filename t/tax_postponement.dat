40|$|PROPERTY <b>TAX</b> <b>POSTPONEMENT.</b> DISABLED PERSON. LEGISLATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. Under {{the present}} {{provisions}} of the Constitution, the Legislature may provide for a person of low or moderate income who is 62 {{years of age or}} older to postpone payment of ad valorem property taxes on a dwelling owned and occupied by the person as a principal place of residence. This measure allows the Legislature to also provide for a disabled person to postpone payment of ad valorem property taxes on a dwelling owned and occupied by the person as a principal place of residence. Summary of Legislative Analyst 2 ̆ 7 s estimate of net state and local government fiscal impact: By itself, this measure would have no direct effect on state expenditures or revenues as it only authorizes the Legislature to extend eligibility for the property <b>tax</b> <b>postponement</b> program. If the Legislature enacts implementing legislation, there would be an increase in state expenditures to compensate local agencies for the amount of the property taxes deferred, estimated to be less than 82 million annually. The state would recover these costs, with interest, when the homes are sold...|$|E

Authorizes Legislature {{to provide}} for manner in which persons of low or {{moderate}} income, age 62 or older, may postpone ad valorem property taxes on principal place of residence. Requires Legislature {{to provide for}} subventions to cities, counties and districts for revenue lost by postponement of taxes. Provides for reimbursement to state for such subventions, including interest and state costs out of postponed taxes when paid. Financial impact: No direct fiscal effect [...] depends upon the adoption of implementing legislation. However, if implemented, the state {{would be required to}} reimburse local governments for the revenue losses from the postponement, and the state in turn would be reimbursed for its costs when the postponed taxes are repaid...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s the Dutch labour unions and {{employer}} organisations agreed {{to transform the}} generous and actuarially unfair early retirement (ER) schemes into less generous and actuarially fair schemes that reward individuals for postponing retirement. The starting dates of these new ER programs varied by industry sector. In this study, we exploit this variation in starting dates to estimate the causal impact of the policy reform on early retirement behaviour. We use a large administrative dataset, the Dutch Income Panel 1989 – 2000, to estimate hazard rate models for the retirement age. We conclude that the policy reform has indeed induced workers to postpone retirement. Both the wealth effect (lower ER wealth) and the substitution effect (lower implicit <b>taxes</b> on retirement <b>postponement)</b> are significant, the latter being more substantial.

50|$|During a brief {{pause in}} the fighting, the Sublime Porte tried to end the {{rebellion}} through negotiations. Dervish Cara requested that Albanians be exempt from {{the law of the}} Ottoman army, under which all Muslims were forced to serve in the regular army (Nizam); stop the replacement of Ottoman local government officials (who were Albanians or spoke Albanian) with Turkish officials brought from Anatolia, who knew neither the language and customs; and the recognition of Albanian autonomy within the Ottoman Empire, as was recognized the autonomy of Serbia in 1830. The Sublime Porte did not accept the terms and countered with their own. They offered that amnesty would be given to the rebels as well as abolishment of the new <b>taxes</b> and the <b>postponement</b> of the recruitment process which would become voluntary in the future. However, the rebels must hand over their armaments to the Ottoman commander in chief Omer Pasha and no Albanian autonomy with in the empire. Cara refused the offer and fighting resumed.|$|R
40|$|The {{period of}} {{economic}} transformations {{which started in}} Poland at the early 1990 has revealed a number of weaknesses and maladjustments of enterprises, particularly those state owned, to the market economy demands. The Polish legislator, aiming at eliminating the adverse results of those phenomena {{as well as the}} causes of their occurrence, has introduced a number of legal acts establishing different institutions operating at different levels, among them the restructuring and recovery of financial management in enterprises. The aim of both is to restore the ability of businesses to compete in the market,and improve their financial condition. These aims can be realized with the help of selected legal instruments. The most important are those of tax character. They can be of different kinds though they are mainly associated with activities aiming to regulate tax obligations, such as: renouncement of a tax obligation, cancellation of the <b>tax</b> in arrears, <b>postponement</b> of <b>tax</b> payment deadlines, or installment plans. The paper analyses selected issues connected with the use of tax instruments of that such kind for the needs of restructuring and recovery of businesses {{as well as for the}} legal procedures that enable application of those instruments in practice...|$|R
40|$|PROPERTY <b>TAX</b> <b>POSTPONEMENT.</b> LEGISLATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT • This measure authorizes the Legislature {{to provide}} for {{postponement}} of ad valorem property tax increases attributable to reappraisal of residential property on acquisition by low-income tenant-occupants as a principal place of residence. • Provides that the total of the postponed taxes, plus the full amount of current property tax assessments shall not exceed 90 percent of owner 2 ̆ 7 s equity. • Subventions to local agencies {{are not required to}} replace revenues lost by reason of property taxes postponed pursuant to this measure. Summary of Legislative Analyst 2 ̆ 7 s Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: • If implemented by the Legislature, this measure could result in millions of dollars of costs annually to either the state or to local government as homeowners who participate in this program postpone payment of their property taxes. • Costs resulting from this measure eventually would be recovered as participating homeowners sell their homes...|$|E
50|$|The {{requests}} of {{the rebels}} were not accepted. In a move to disunite the rebels, the Ottoman government declared an amnesty, the abolishment of the new <b>taxes</b> and the <b>postponement</b> of the recruitment process, which would become voluntary in the future. A promise {{was made by the}} Ottoman commander in chief Omer Pasha to the Albanians that if they handed over their arms, they would receive the same rights as the Serbs in 1830, which meant autonomy. At the same time an Ottoman army of 30,000 men, led by Omer Pasha, was sent to Monastir. Bib Doda, Kepadan of Mirdita tribe in northern Albania, came with his men to aid to the Ottomans as a sign of loyalty to the Porte, playing {{an important role in the}} fights. In May 1844 the Ottoman army attacked the rebels, forcing them to retreat to the areas of Kalkandelen, Üsküb and Kumanova. Heavy fighting took place from 13-17 May 1844 in Katlanovo Pass, and on 18 May in Katlanovo thermals. Given the disparity of numbers and their lack of artillery, the rebels could no longer resist the superior Ottoman army. On 21 May 1844 the Ottoman army entered Üsküb, where many reprisals took place. During May-June, after bitter struggle with the rebels the Ottoman army retook Kumanova, Preševo, Bujanovac, Vranje, Kalkandelen and Gostivar whilst in July the Ottoman army captured all areas ranging from Kačanik to Pristina. Dervish Cara was captured by Ottoman forces in summer 1844.|$|R
50|$|The {{capture of}} Dervish Cara didn't {{put an end}} to the rebellion, which {{continued}} in the areas of Dibër and İşkodra. The resistance was very strong especially in Dibër under its local leaders. In the fall of 1844, the Ottoman army was concentrated against the rebels in the Sanjak of Dibra. Ottoman forces led by Rexhep Pasha were defeated by the rebels in the field of Mavrova. The rebels in the Sanjak of Dibër were led from Sheh Mustafa Zerqani, a Bektashi priest. In a meeting in November 1844 they declared that the old autonomy of Dibër was not to be changed. The rebel army led by Cen Leka tried to stop the advancing Ottoman army led by Hayredin Pasha. The Ottoman commander declared again an amnesty, the abolishment of the new <b>taxes</b> and the <b>postponement</b> of the recruitment process which would become voluntary in the future. The greatest resistance happened during the Battle of Gjuricë, which lasted for five days. According to the report of a French diplomat in Ioannina, even women and children participated in the battle. The Ottoman army suffered a great number of losses but due to their great superiority in numbers and armaments, they succeeded in forcing the rebels to retreat from the battle. The reprisals from the Ottoman army forced a large number of people to leave their homes. Although the rebellion was crushed, the Ottoman government postponed the application of Tanzimat for the Sanjak of Dibër and Shkodër. Dervish Cara together with other local leaders was sentenced to death, but this punishment was later transformed into a lifetime sentence.|$|R
