40|$|A rapid {{infiltration}} land wastewater application site, {{composed of}} unconsolidated silty sand and gravel, {{which has been}} in continuous operation for over 30 years was examined for the accumulation and/or migration of a tracer virus (coliphage f 2), indigenous enteroviruses, and enteric indicator bacteria in the soils and underlying groundwater. Tracer f 2 penetrated into groundwater together with the front of percolating primary effluent and was not observed to concentrate on the upper soil layers. The tracer virus concentration in a 60 -foot (about 18. 3 -m) -deep observation well directly beneath the wastewater application area began to increase within 48 h after application to the soil. The tracer level in this well stabilized after 72 h at a level of approximately 47 % of the average applied concentration. Indigenous enteroviruses and tracer f 2 were sporadically detected in the groundwater at horizontal distances of 600 feet (about 183 m) from the application zone. Laboratory soil adsorption studies confirmed the poor virus adsorption observed at the site. This was especially <b>true</b> <b>on</b> <b>surface</b> soils when contained in wastewater. Enteric indicator bacteria were readily concentrated on the soil surface by filtration on the soil surface mat. However, during tracer f 2 virus tests, comparison studies with fecal Streptococcus revealed that bacteria capable of penetrating the surface were able to migrate into the groundwater. They were detected at the same locations as tracer and enteric viruses...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} nowhere-zero flows {{began with a}} key {{observation}} of Tutte that in planar graphs, nowhere-zero k-flows are dual to k-colourings (in the form of k-tensions). Tutte conjectured that every graph without a cut-edge has a nowhere-zero 5 -flow. Seymour proved that every such graph has a nowhere-zero 6 -flow. For a graph embedded in an orientable surface of higher genus, flows are not dual to colourings, but to local-tensions. By Seymour’s theorem, every graph <b>on</b> an orientable <b>surface</b> without the obvious obstruction has a nowhere-zero 6 -local-tension.

40|$|This partly expository paper investigates {{versions}} of the Tate conjecture on the cycle map for varieties defined over finite fields with values in 'etale cohomology with Z_ℓ-coefficients. The bulk of the paper is an exposition of a 1998 result of C. Schoen which shows that an integral version of the conjecture holds for 1 -cycles provided the usual conjecture is <b>true</b> for divisors <b>on</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In a last section we then derive from Schoen's theorem new results {{on the existence of}} degree one zero-cycles on varieties defined over the function field of a smooth proper curve C over the algebraic closure of a finite field. In particular, we show that if the variety in question is a smooth projective complete intersection of dimension at least 3 and of degree prime to the characteristic, then a zero-cycle of degree one exists if the Tate conjecture is <b>true</b> for divisors <b>on</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the variety extends to a proper fibration over C all of whose fibres possess a component of multiplicity one.

40|$|The {{effects of}} land cover and <b>surface</b> slope <b>on</b> lidar-derived {{elevation}} data were examined for a watershed in the pied-mont of North Carolina. Lidar {{data were collected}} over the study area in a winter (leaf-off) overflight. Survey-grade elevation points (1, 225) for six different land cover classes were used as reference points. Root mean squared error (RMSE) for land cover classes ranged from 14. 5 cm to 36. 1 cm. Land cover with taller canopy vegetation exhibited the largest errors. The largest mean error (36. 1 cm RMSE) was in the scrub-shrub cover class. Over the small slope range (0 ° to 10 °) in this study area, there was little evidence {{for an increase in}} elevation error with increased slopes. However, for low grass land cover, elevation errors do increase in a consistent manner with increasing slope. Slope errors increased with increasing surface slope, under-predicting <b>true</b> slope <b>on</b> <b>surface</b> slopes 2 °.

Strings are a preferred architecture of metamaterials as they extend continuously along one dimension. Here, we demonstrate that laterally interconnecting strings by structural elements that are placed in oscillation nodes such as to not quench electromagnetic resonances enables manufacturing of self-supported free-standing all-metal metamaterials. Upright S-strings, interconnected by rods, form a space-grid which we call meta-foil. In this way, we introduce binding between the "atoms" of the metamaterial, thus doing away with conventional "frozen-in solutions" like matrix embedding or thin films on substrates. Meta-foils are locally stiff, yet globally flexible. Even bent to cylinders of 1 cm radius, they maintain their spectral response, thus becoming <b>true</b> metamaterials <b>on</b> curved <b>surfaces.</b> Exploiting UV/X-ray lithography and ultimately plastic moulding, meta-foils can be cost-effectively manufactured in large areas and quantities to serve as optical elements.

40|$|Laminar-turbulent {{transition}} in compressible, high-speed boundary layers is currently not well understood. The transition location <b>on</b> the <b>surface</b> {{of a vehicle}} can therefore not accurately be predicted. This is particularly <b>true</b> for transition <b>on</b> <b>surfaces</b> with a localized two-dimensional unevenness, such as a roughness element (Balakumar 2003; Marxen et al. 2009). Cases with geometrical changes are relevant {{for a number of}} applications, including the heat-shield of vehicles (re-) entering a planetary atmosphere and the inlet to scram jet combustors for hypersonic cruise vehicles. Transition is undesirable on the heat shield due to an associated increase in temperature. It is desirable for scram jets to ensure proper mixing within the combustor. In all theses applications an accurate prediction of the transition location is advantageous for the vehicle design. Presently, many transition prediction methods rely on a deterministic description in which a fixed transition location is computed. Examples are correlation-based methods and the e N-method (Malik 1989). Typical N-factors at transition lie in the range of 5 − 10 (see examples in Malik 2003).

40|$|In data {{integration}} we transform {{information from a}} source into a target schema. A general problem in this task is loss of fidelity and coverage: the source expresses more knowledge than can fit into the target schema, or knowledge {{that is hard to}} fit into any schema at all. This problem is taken to an extreme in information extraction (IE) where the source is natural language. To address this issue, one can either automatically learn a latent schema emergent in text (a brittle and ill-defined task), or manually extend schemas. We propose instead to store data in a probabilistic database of universal schema. This schema is simply the union of all source schemas, and the probabilistic database learns how to predict the cells of each source relation in this union. For example, the database could store Freebase relations and relations that correspond to natural language surface patterns. The database would learn to predict what freebase relations hold <b>true</b> based <b>on</b> what <b>surface</b> patterns appear, and vice versa. We describe an analogy between such databases and collaborative filtering models, and use it to implement our paradigm with probabilistic PCA, a scalable and effective collaborative filtering method. ...|$|R

This background component comprises of the additional trajectory of the SPM scanner due to the sample tilt and the scan range.

40|$|Adhesives {{have long}} been {{designed}} around a trade-off between adhesive strength and releasability. Within this spectrum, specialized materials {{have been designed to}} maximize adhesive ability for a given application. To overcome this trade-off, a new adhesive paradigm is required. Biologically inspired adhesives have been of interest over the past two decades, because organisms are seen using their adhesive pads to achieve high adhesive forces, while maintaining releasability and reusability. Many biological organisms possess microscopic fibrillar features on their toe-pads, which enables climbing. While much effort has been spent attempting to mimic these features, ultimately high force capacities have not been achieved. Recently, a new framework has been introduced which states that a specific surface morphology is not necessary for creating high force capacity, easy release adhesives. This framework states that for shear adhesives to achieve high force capacity, the ratio of contact area to compliance in the loading direction, A/C, must be increased. In this thesis we focus on expanding this framework to quantitatively understand both compliance and area, {{for a wide range of}} adhesive materials and geometries, and across a wide range of substrates with varying roughness. To increase the functionality of high strength, reusable adhesives, we have developed a new adhesive configuration which supports normal loading as well as shear loading. Finally, we expand to a new field, biological prosthetic materials, and develop fabric-based composites which are extremely tough, strong, and flexible, while containing water. The foundation of the work presented in this thesis is based upon an analytical model developed to calculate the compliance of fabricated adhesives (Chapter 2). Combining this knowledge with the previously developed scaling theory allows a high degree of accuracy in calculating force capacity. While this method works well for smooth surfaces such as glass, it assumes that the nominal pad area is equal to the true area of contact, which is not <b>true</b> <b>on</b> rough <b>surfaces.</b> A model is developed to calculate the true area of contact based <b>on</b> <b>surface</b> roughness and adhesive materials properties (Chapter 3). The results of this model demonstrate that there is an optimum pad modulus for any given surface roughness to achieve maximum stress capacity. In some situations, high strength and easy release adhesives are required in normal loading situations. We develop a new adhesive configuration which enables shear adhesives to support normal loads (Chapter 4). This method results in a six-fold increase in normal force capacity. This provides tolerance in adhesives applications, greatly improving the commercial utility of these adhesives. Finally, we use techniques learned from the fabrication of adhesives to develop composites from polyampholyte gels and glass fiber fabrics (Chapter 5). These materials exhibit enhanced properties over the controls, including extremely high toughness and strength, while maintaining flexibility and containing water. A general mechanism is explained that results in these improved properties, opening up opportunities to develop enhanced composites from fabrics and soft materials in other fields...|$|R
