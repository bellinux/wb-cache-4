2500|$|Keane had a Labrador Retriever named <b>Triggs,</b> {{who died}} in 2012. <b>Triggs</b> came to {{international}} attention in 2002 during an incident ahead of that year's FIFA World Cup when Keane engaged in a public quarrel and left the squad. <b>Triggs</b> accompanied Keane on regular walks pursued by the press. The footballer said of <b>Triggs,</b> [...] "Unlike humans, dogs don't talk shit". The Daily Telegraphs Steve Wilson once described <b>Triggs</b> as [...] "the most famous dog in football since Pickles, a mongrel who dug up the stolen Jules Rimet Trophy in 1966, or that dog that relieved itself on Jimmy Greaves at the 1962 World Cup". Henry Winter, writing in the same paper, called <b>Triggs</b> [...] "the fittest dog in Cheshire" [...] and opined that [...] "if Cruft's (sic) held an endurance event, Keane and <b>Triggs</b> would scoop gold".|$|R

5|$|Wallhead {{made his}} BAMMA debut at BAMMA 7 against Frank <b>Trigg.</b> <b>Trigg</b> {{was set to}} face Tom 'Kong' Watson for Watson's middleweight title, but Watson {{suffered}} a back injury forcing his withdrawal and allowing Wallhead to step up as his replacement. In the opening round, Wallhead caught <b>Trigg</b> with a left hook which appeared to hurt him, before executing a successful takedown. He ended the first round landing ground-and-pound shots which opened up a cut on Trigg's cheek. The second round saw Wallhead land the stronger strikes, but less often than <b>Trigg.</b> The final round was also close, though Wallhead once again managed to rock <b>Trigg</b> early in the round. The fight went to the judges, where Wallhead won via split decision (29-28, 28-29 and 30-27).|$|E
5|$|A {{committee}} {{was set up}} in October 1838 to investigate the viability of a causeway at the site. On 16 February 1839 plans which had been prepared by Roe were submitted by the committee's chairman to Henry <b>Trigg,</b> the Superintendent of Public Works. <b>Trigg</b> called for other plans and prepared estimates. At a meeting of the committee on 27 February 1839, <b>Trigg</b> submitted a plan designed by Major Frederick Irwin, which was estimated to cost £2,300. The committee cut the estimated figure to £1,800, and waited for Governor Hutt to specify how much could be funded by the government.|$|E

Styles defeated Angle to win the medal on the telecast. Styles and Angle fought a week later on the August 21 episode of Impact! in a ladder match for the medal, with Styles retaining the medal. Styles {{then went on to}} feud with Angle's on-screen bestfriend Frank <b>Trigg,</b> who attacked Styles with a kendo stick during Styles' Four Ways to Glory qualification match with Cage, costing Styles to bout in the process. This led to Styles challenging <b>Trigg</b> to a bout at No Surrender, which <b>Trigg</b> agreed to but only if it was contested under Mixed Martial Arts rules on the September11 episode of Impact!. Styles and <b>Trigg</b> fought to a no contest at No Surrender due to Styles accidentally hitting <b>Trigg</b> in the groin. Afterwards, Styles beat <b>Trigg</b> with a kendo stick to end their feud.

5000|$|In October 2016, it was alleged by Liberal Senator Ian MacDonald {{and others}} that <b>Triggs</b> had misled the Senate by stating that a {{journalist}} had misquoted comments made by <b>Triggs</b> about several Australian politicians. <b>Triggs</b> had been reported in a profile piece by The Saturday Paper as saying: [...] "I knew I could have responded and destroyed them", with reference to a Senate Committee. <b>Triggs</b> asserted that these comments had been added by a [...] "subeditor", however <b>Triggs</b> subsequently said that, [...] "upon further reflection" [...] she accepted that the article was [...] "an accurate excerpt from a longer interview" [...] {{and that she had}} [...] "no intention of questioning The Saturday Papers journalistic integrity." ...|$|R
2500|$|Following her rise to fame, <b>Triggs</b> was {{mentioned}} by several sources on many occasions, with Keane [...] "dogged" [...] by numerous canine references {{for the remainder}} of his career. In 2006, when Keane moved house to Sunderland, his reunion with <b>Triggs,</b> who joined him later, came to the notice of the press. In 2007, Keane was reported to have heard of his team's promotion to the Premiership while walking <b>Triggs.</b> The following year, Keane was said to have acquired a German Shepherd Dog named Izac to accompany <b>Triggs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Meadow Lea brand {{was founded}} by Oliver <b>Triggs</b> in 1932, in Enmore, Sydney, but had its origins about four years earlier in Richmond, Melbourne, where <b>Triggs</b> owned a small grocery store. In about 1934 <b>Triggs</b> hired James (Jim) Armstrong as a sales manager, on commission, for country regions in New South Wales. In 1941 <b>Triggs</b> and Armstrong reached an {{agreement}} whereby Armstrong would sell his roughly 25% sales commission share in the Meadow Lea Margarine Company to Triggs' son Kenneth (Ken) when he turned 21 in 1945.|$|R
5|$|<b>Trigg</b> was {{appointed}} to the Virginia Land Court Commission in 1779, charged with settling land titles in Kentucky. He then settled in Kentucky himself. In 1782, a raiding party of Shawnee Indians led by British and Loyalist officers attacked Bryan Station, but were driven off. Kentucky militia companies then pursued the fleeing invaders. <b>Trigg</b> commanded half of the men, Daniel Boone the other. Ignoring Boone's warnings of a trap, the militiamen charged into an Indian ambush at Blue Licks. <b>Trigg</b> and many others, including Boone's youngest son, were killed. Trigg's body was later found cut into pieces.|$|E
5|$|A son of William and Mary (Johns) <b>Trigg,</b> he mainly {{worked as}} a public servant and militia officer {{during the early years}} of the {{frontier}} counties of southwest Virginia, which then Kentucky. He was one reportedly of the wealthiest men on the frontier. <b>Trigg</b> was a delegate to the first Virginia revolutionary conventions, and was a member of the Fincastle Committee of Safety that drafted the Fincastle Resolutions, a precursor to the Declaration of Independence passed by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. He was also elected to the Virginia House of Delegates.|$|E
5|$|In 1782, the British staged an {{invasion}} of Kentucky {{with the help of}} their Native American allies, including Wyandots, Ottawas and Ojibwas. When <b>Trigg</b> received word of their attack on Bryan Station, he was commanding the fort at Harrodsburg. He quickly assembled 135 local militiamen and met up with Colonel Daniel Boone and Major Levi Todd and more militia at Bryan Station. When they approached the Blue Licks, a salt lick next to the Licking River, officers suspected a trap and convened a war council, but unruly troops lost patience and crossed the river. The three leaders formed a column each, with <b>Trigg</b> commanding the right. When they met with the opposing force, Trigg's column was ambushed. <b>Trigg</b> was killed and his men fell back after only five minutes of battle. When troops returned to the scene of battle, Trigg's body was found quartered.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{government}} sources {{had suggested}} that <b>Triggs</b> {{had wanted to be}} [...] "looked after" [...] if she quit the Commission. However, <b>Triggs</b> said she [...] "categorically denies any suggestion that the issue of a job offer and resignation came at her instigation". <b>Triggs</b> said at the Senate hearing that she considered the offer made to her a [...] "disgraceful proposition".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Triggs</b> {{resides in}} Sydney, and {{is married to}} former Australian diplomat Alan Brown [...] <b>Triggs</b> was {{previously}} married to Melbourne law professor Sandy Clark, {{with whom she had}} three children.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, {{events had}} moved from local agitations against the British crown to {{outright}} war. Early on, <b>Trigg</b> served in local militias, but he also represented Fincastle in the Virginia Conventions. These were five political meetings that started after Lord Dunmore, the governor of Virginia, had dissolved the House of Burgesses after its delegates expressed solidarity with Boston, Massachusetts, where the harbor had been closed by the British. <b>Trigg</b> was at the first convention in 1774 and was elected a delegate to the second convention in 1775, {{though he did not}} attend. He was elected to the third convention (July–August 1775), and did appear. He was also a delegate to the Fourth Convention (December 1775– January 1776), but did not attend.|$|E
5|$|Stephen <b>Trigg</b> (c. 1744– August 19, 1782) was an American pioneer and soldier from Virginia. He {{was killed}} ten {{months after the}} {{surrender}} of Cornwallis at Yorktown {{in one of the}} last battles of the American Revolution while leading the Lincoln County militia at the Battle of Blue Licks, Kentucky.|$|E
50|$|From 1996 to 2005, <b>Triggs</b> was a {{full-time}} Professor at Melbourne Law School. <b>Triggs</b> has published papers on various topics of public international law, including World Trade Organization (WTO) disputes resolution, energy and resources law, {{law of the}} sea, territorial sovereignty, jurisdiction and immunity, international criminal law, international environmental law and human rights. <b>Triggs</b> {{is also the author}} of two editions of International Law: Contemporary Principles and Practices.|$|R
25|$|Arkansas' capital city, Little Rock, {{had fallen}} to Union forces on September 10, 1862. During the {{operations}} {{leading up to the}} fall of the capital, W. E. Woodruff, formerly of the Pulaski Light Artillery, had formed a temporary battery for the defence of Little Rock. The battery was under the command of Woodruff and 1st Lieutenant Anderson Mills “of <b>Trigg’s</b> battery, on leave”. Woodruff goes on to state “Mills was first lieutenant of <b>Trigg’s</b> battery, so assigned from Marshall’s Battery. He was acting captain for the new battery from its inception until the surrender”. It is assumed that the “new battery” refers to <b>Trigg’s</b> Battery. The Compiled Service Record for R. A. Mills (Arkansas Miscellaneous) has the note “1st Lieut Comdg 9th Ark Batty. <b>Trigg’s</b> Battery.” It may be that the 9th Arkansas Field Battery was <b>Trigg's</b> in name only.|$|R
5000|$|Further {{controversy}} arose when <b>Triggs</b> told a Senate Estimates {{hearing that}} Brandis' departmental secretary had on 3 February 2015 {{asked her to}} resign, {{just prior to the}} public release of the Commission's report. <b>Triggs</b> said that she was told that she would be offered [...] "other work with the government" [...] if she resigned. Initially the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, denied that any offer of any other role was made to <b>Triggs.</b> However, Bishop conceded that an international role had been discussed with <b>Triggs</b> in early February, during a meeting in her office with the secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, Chris Moraitis.|$|R
5|$|The new Virginia {{counties}} {{were growing}} rapidly, {{and with this}} growth came trouble. <b>Trigg</b> was appointed {{as one of the}} judges to the Virginia Land Court commission of 1779–80 charged with settling land disputes in Kentucky County, Virginia. The Virginia Land Act of 1779 had set up this court of four judges in order to examine the numerous land claims and to certify valid titles. The four judges arrived at St. Asaph in October and triggered emigration to Kentucky as people wished to either certify their claims or seek unclaimed land. They closed their court on February 26, 1780, and prepared to return home. However, in March they were told that they had to reopen the court and stay through April, as claimants were delayed due to weather. <b>Trigg</b> and two fellow judges reconvened on April 16 and heard another 134 cases. In all, the court judged 1,328 claims covering over 1 million acres (4,000km²) of land. After these sessions ended, <b>Trigg</b> stayed and established his home on 1,000 acres (4km²) of land at Trigg's Station about four miles (6km) north-west of Harrodsburg in Kentucky County, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The western {{county of}} Augusta in Virginia {{could no longer}} {{serve the needs of}} the far flung pioneers along the New River, and so in 1769, the county of Botetourt was created. <b>Trigg</b> was one of several {{appointed}} as its first justices of the peace, which was a judge presiding over misdemeanors and other civil cases. From 1770 to 1771, he served as magistrate, Justice of the County Court in Chancery and a Justice of Oyer and Terminer, which was a criminal court. When the town of Fincastle, Virginia was forming in 1770, <b>Trigg</b> was instrumental in its development, helping to sell lots and build the town's prison along with a courthouse with his father-in-law, Israel Christian.|$|E
5|$|After the war, in 1867, {{he founded}} the Villa Maria Academy of the Visitation in Abingdon for the {{education}} of girls. He was judge of the Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery of Virginia in 1869–1870. Also around 1869, he formed a law partnership with a young local attorney, and his future son-in-law, Daniel <b>Trigg.</b> In 1872, they set up their offices in a small building near the courthouse which became known as the Johnston-Trigg Law Office.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2016, <b>Triggs</b> {{supported}} {{a proposal to}} change Section 18C. At the time, it was unlawful to [...] "offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate" [...] {{on the basis of}} race. <b>Triggs</b> said removing [...] "offend" [...] and [...] "insult" [...] and inserting [...] "vilify" [...] would be a strengthening of the laws. However, in February 2017, <b>Triggs</b> told a Senate committee the AHRC did not see a case to change 18C but recommended reforms requiring that respondents be notified of complaints and allowing the president greater powers to reject complaints. <b>Triggs</b> said “it’s true, the students have suffered from this … but I cannot concede the Commission did anything wrong.” ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1964, renovations {{were being}} carried out on a {{property}} in Middle Row, and a Fred Usher claimed to have seen a man about [...] tall, shabbily dressed in overcoat and gaiters, disappear through the solid brick wall in front of <b>Trigg's</b> barn. A reporter from the Nationwide TV show visited in 1975 but failed to get <b>Trigg's</b> ghost to appear. It is said that <b>Trigg's</b> ghost wanders the old house searching for his remains.|$|R
50|$|Harry Benjamin Inigo <b>Triggs</b> {{was born}} in Chiswick, London, on 28 February 1876, to parents James <b>Triggs,</b> carpet agent, and his wife Celia Anne, née Bryant. His older brother was Arthur Bryant <b>Triggs</b> (1868-1936) born in Chelsea, who in 1887 emigrated to Australia, {{becoming}} a wealthy New South Wales grazier (known as The Sheep King) and collector of art, books and coins. The architect Inigo Jones was a distant relative. 1907 he married Gladys Claire.|$|R
5|$|Settlers again {{agitated}} {{for another}} split, and so Fincastle County was split into three counties and became defunct in 1776; the new counties were Montgomery, Washington and Kentucky. <b>Trigg</b> was again {{a member of}} the first court of justices held for a new county, this time Montgomery. He also served in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1778.|$|E
5|$|<b>Trigg</b> {{continued}} his {{service in the}} militia throughout this period. In 1781, he was made colonel of the Lincoln County militia. In 1782, the four delegates to the Virginia General Assembly from Kentucky pushed for Trigg's recommendation {{as one of the}} assistant judges to the newly created Supreme Court for Kentucky, but his early death prevented him from taking this position.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{election}} following the {{ratification of the}} Kentucky Constitution of 1850, Burnett was elected clerk of the circuit court of <b>Trigg</b> County, Kentucky, defeating James E.
