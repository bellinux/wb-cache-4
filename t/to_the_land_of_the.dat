5|$|Wanting {{to reunite}} with Victoria, Victor tricks Emily into taking him back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Living by pretending {{he wants her}} to meet his parents. She agrees to this and takes him to see Elder Gutknecht, the kindly ruler of the underworld, to return Victor and Emily {{temporarily}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Living. Once back home, Victor asks Emily {{to wait in the}} forest while he rushes off to see Victoria and confess his wish to marry her as soon as possible, to which she gladly returns his feelings. Just as they are about to share a kiss, Emily arrives and sees the two of them together. Feeling betrayed and hurt, she angrily drags Victor back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead. Victoria tells her parents that Victor has been forcibly wed to a dead woman, but no one believes her. With Victor gone, Victoria's parents decide to marry her off against her will to a presumed-wealthy newcomer in town named Lord Barkis Bittern, who appeared at the wedding rehearsal.|$|E
5|$|Eardwulf's {{whereabouts}} {{after his}} recovery are not known. In surviving King Æthelred's anger {{he was more}} fortunate than Ælfwald's sons, who were drowned on Æthelred's orders in 791.

Æthelred himself was assassinated on 18 April 796, perhaps at Corbridge, by conspirators led by the dux Ealdred.

5|$|The player {{takes the}} role of the rōnin Shiren, who travels through thirty areas on his way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Golden Condor. The game is turn-based, with all enemies and {{characters}} in an area moving whenever the player performs an action, such as attacking or moving. If the player falls in battle, they lose all their progress and are forced to restart {{from the beginning of the}} game: to counter-act this, they can choose to store powerful items in warehouses, and pick them up again on further playthroughs; the Nintendo DS release also adds rescue quests, where a player can save other players who have fallen, allowing them to continue from where they left off.|$|E

5|$|Devil Summoner {{takes place}} in Hirasaki, a coastal Japanese city that has seen a recent rise in supernatural activity. The player character, an unnamed college student, is asked to {{accompany}} his girlfriend Kumiko Hatano {{to check out a}} book on the occult for her studies. Going to an amusement park to buy some concert tickers at Kumiko's request, the protagonist is attacked by demons and saved by Kyouji Kuzunoha, a Summoner belonging to an ancient clan dedicated to protecting Japan from supernatural threats. Shortly after leaving him, Kuzunoha dies under mysterious circumstances. Shortly after this, the protagonist is attacked by a Dark Summoner named Sid Davis. Killed by Davis, he is returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living by Charon. Upon waking, the protagonist finds himself in the body of Kuzunoha, who was also killed by Davis.

5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} in the Land of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls aim to {{make their way to the}} Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.|$|E

Both have concerns about marrying someone they do not know, but upon meeting for the first time, they fall for each other. After the shy Victor ruins the wedding rehearsal by forgetting his vows, he flees and practices his wedding vows in the nearby forest, placing the wedding ring on a nearby upturned tree root. The root {{turns out to be}} the finger of a murdered woman in a tattered bridal gown named Emily, who rises from the grave claiming that she is now Victor's wife. After fainting, Victor wakes up and finds himself spirited away <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead.

Eventually, the gods tire of his boasting and invoke Thor, who arrives. Hrungnir states that Thor is under their protection, and subsequently he can't be harmed while in Valhalla.
