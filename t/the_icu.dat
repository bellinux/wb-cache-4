5|$|A {{battle for}} Mogadishu {{followed}} {{in the first half}} of 2006 in which the ARPCT confronted <b>the</b> <b>ICU.</b> However, with local support, <b>the</b> <b>ICU</b> captured the city in June of the year. It then expanded its area of control in south-central Somalia over the following months, assisted militarily by Eritrea. In an effort at reconciliation, TFG and ICU representatives held several rounds of talks in Khartoum under the auspices of the Arab League. The meetings ended unsuccessfully due to uncompromising positions retained by both parties. Hardline Islamists subsequently gained power within <b>the</b> <b>ICU,</b> prompting fears of a Talibanization of the movement.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{artillery}} strikes continued, eventually forcing <b>the</b> <b>ICU</b> frontlines to falter. A mutiny within <b>the</b> <b>ICU</b> caused {{their forces}} to disintegrate, and abandon both Jilib and Kismayo. At 10p.m., {{the sounds of}} battle died down. By midnight, <b>the</b> <b>ICU</b> front in Jilib had collapsed, and <b>the</b> <b>ICU</b> began to flee. By 2:00a.m., they had fled from Kismayo. Local militiamen patrolled the streets, and looting began of former ICU property. They were reported to be fleeing towards Ras Kamboni island in southern Somalia, or the Kenyan border.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of centralized government, much {{of the legal system}} and most of the educational institutions and social services fell under the control of religious institutions, which often received significant funding and support from international charities. In 2005, some of these clerical organizations united to form the Islamic Courts Union, after the secular rebel leaders began to challenge the sharia-based judicial institutions. Wary of Islamist paramilitaries {{in the age of the}} War on Terror, the CIA funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to secular rebel leaders inside Somalia in 2006, intending thereby to neutralize the threat of suspected members of Al Qaeda they believed to be sheltered by <b>the</b> <b>ICU.</b> This was cited by experts as a factor in the resurgence of Islamic militias in the country, prompting the latter to engage in pre-emptive strikes which routed the rebel leaders and led to the seizure of Ford by <b>the</b> <b>ICU.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ICU</b> gained control of Mogadishu and its surrounding districts in June 2006, after the Second Battle of Mogadishu. <b>The</b> <b>ICU</b> was later overthrown by the Ethiopian military with the support of the United Nations, African Union, and the United States government. After <b>the</b> <b>ICU</b> forces were chased from Mogadishu, the leaders of the Transitional Federal Parliament entered Somalia declaring themselves the rightful governors of Somalia. As of October 2007, there was still widespread opposition within Somalia to the TFG, and the TFG's leaders and their allies were still attempting to suppress a strong insurgency. In January 2009 politician Abdirahman Ahmed was executed for alleged apostasy by a Sharia court.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, <b>the</b> <b>ICU</b> {{announced}} {{major changes}} {{to bring it}} into line with the main cricket governing bodies.

5|$|In December 2006, Ethiopian troops entered Somalia {{to assist}} the TFG against the {{advancing}} Islamic Courts Union, initially winning the Battle of Baidoa. On 28 December 2006, the allied forces recaptured the capital from <b>the</b> <b>ICU.</b> The offensive helped the TFG solidify its rule. Ethiopian and TFG forces forced <b>the</b> <b>ICU</b> from Ras Kamboni between 7–12 January 2007. They were assisted by at least two U.S. air strikes. On 8 January 2007, {{for the first time}} since taking office, President Ahmed entered Mogadishu from Baidoa as the TFG moved its base to the national capital. President Ahmed brought his Puntland army chief with him, and Abdullahi Ali Omar became Somali chief of army on 10 February 2007.|$|E
5000|$|On 5 June 2006, Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, <b>the</b> <b>ICU's</b> chairman, {{reportedly}} seized Mogadishu, {{saying in}} a radio broadcast: [...] "We won {{the fight against the}} enemy of Islam.

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{investigate}} long-term {{trends in}} antibiotic resistance of common bacterial species isolated {{at a university}} hospital and in its intensive care units (ICUs). MethodsLevels of antibiotic resistance of common bacterial pathogens were investigated at the Karolinska Hospital during the 12 -year period 1988 - 99. Resistance rates were analyzed for the entire hospital, {{as well as for}} <b>ICUs</b> combined. ResultsAt <b>the</b> Karolinska Hospital, we found increased ciprofloxacin resistance among Escherichia coli isolates, from 0 % in 1991 to 11 % in 1999. In <b>the</b> <b>ICUs,</b> <b>the</b> corresponding increase was from 0 % to 4. 8 % during the same period. Co-trimoxazole resistance levels increased from 7. 5 % to 14 %, with lower levels for <b>the</b> <b>ICUs.</b> For ampicillin, cefuroxime, and gentamicin, the levels of resistance were similar in the whole hospital and in <b>the</b> <b>ICUs.</b> Among Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, imipenem resistance was higher in <b>the</b> <b>ICUs.</b> For ciprofloxacin, resistance increased from 2. 5 % in 1991 to 13 % in 1999 in the whole hospital, with similar figures for <b>the</b> <b>ICUs.</b> ConclusionThe resistance rates at the Karolinska Hospital were still generally low, but were increasing for some antibiotic-microbe combinations. The results emphasize the importance of including all sectors of a hospital in resistance surveillance studies, and also the value of long surveillance periods...|$|R

5|$|On Sunday, 31 December, {{fighting}} {{began in}} the thick mango forests near Helashid, 11 miles (18km) to the northwest of Jilib. Ethiopian MiG fighters, tanks, artillery and mortars struck Islamic positions in the assault.

5|$|The Battle of Jilib was {{a battle}} in the 2006 Somali War fought by the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) and {{affiliated}} militias against Ethiopian and Transitional Federal Government (TFG) forces {{for control of the}} town of Jilib.

5|$|With <b>the</b> <b>ICU</b> in {{a retreat}} for the Kenyan border, Transitional Federal Government forces slowly {{advanced}} towards Kismayo {{to avoid the}} many landmines that had been placed. By 1 January 2007, they had reached Kismayo, which was taken without a fight.|$|E
30|$|Results Fifty-seven {{booklets}} {{were distributed}} in <b>the</b> intervention <b>ICU</b> (8  % of admitted patients). During {{the study period}} (07 / 2014 – 07 / 2015), 93 children were likely to visit their relative. A total of 195 staff members {{participated in the study}} (75  % of ICU staff). They were nurses, auxiliary nurses and physicians in 56, 27 and 14  % of cases, respectively. Participants were equally recruited at <b>the</b> intervention <b>ICU</b> (87 participants, 74  % of <b>ICU</b> staff) and <b>the</b> control <b>ICU</b> (108 participants, 76  % of <b>ICU</b> staff). In <b>the</b> intervention <b>ICU,</b> <b>the</b> proportion of staff members who supported at least one visiting child over the 3  months prior to the questionnaire increased from 41  % before the intervention to 69  % after the intervention (p <  0.001), whereas it was not significantly different in <b>the</b> control <b>ICU</b> (38 vs 39  %, p =  0.97). A multivariate analysis confirmed that the use of the booklet was an independent factor for increasing the rate of caregivers who supported visiting children [OR 4.0, 95  % CI [2.0; 7.9], p <  0.001]. No significant effect of occupation (OR 0.9, p =  0.89), age (OR 1.7, p =  0.15) and years of experience in critical care (OR 0.7, p =  0.34) emerged from this analysis. In <b>the</b> intervention <b>ICU,</b> <b>the</b> proportion of participants who disagreed with child visits decreased from 35 to 14  % (p =  0.002), whereas it remained stable in <b>the</b> control <b>ICU</b> (30 vs 34  %, p =  0.51). In <b>the</b> intervention <b>ICU,</b> <b>the</b> proportion of participants who claimed that the admission policy for child visits had to be improved decreased from 94 to 76  % (p =  0.001), whereas it remained stable in <b>the</b> control <b>ICU</b> (91 vs 91  %, p =  0.94). There {{were no significant differences in}} MDS-R before and after the intervention in both <b>the</b> intervention <b>ICU</b> (21 [12; 30] vs 20 [9; 30], p =  0.44) and <b>the</b> control <b>ICU</b> (18 [10; 29] vs 21 [8; 33], p =  0.13).|$|R

5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in <b>the</b> <b>ICU</b> for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E
5|$|Tradition and old records {{assert that}} {{southern}} Somalia, including the Mogadishu area, was historically inhabited by hunter-gatherers. These were later joined by Cushitic-speaking agro-pastoralists, {{who would go}} on to establish local aristocracies. During its medieval Golden Age, Mogadishu was ruled by the Muzaffar dynasty, a vassal of the Ajuran Sultanate. It subsequently fell under the control of an assortment of local Sultanates and polities, most notably the Sultanate of the Geledi. The city later became the capital of Italian Somaliland (1889–1936) in the colonial period. After the Somali Republic became independent in 1960, Mogadishu became known and promoted as the White Pearl of the Indian Ocean. After the ousting of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 and the ensuing Somali Civil War, various militias fought for control of the city, later to be replaced by the Islamic Courts Union in the mid-2000s. <b>The</b> <b>ICU</b> thereafter splintered into more radical groups, notably al-Shabaab, which fought the Transitional Federal Government (2004–2012) and its African Union Mission to Somalia allies. With a change in administration in late 2010, government troops and their military partners had succeeded in forcing out Al-Shabaab by August 2011. Mogadishu has subsequently experienced a period of intense reconstruction.|$|E

25|$|The Digil and Mirifle clans make up {{the broader}} Rahanweyn group of clans, {{and the leader of}} the Rahanweyn Resistance Army, Aden Saran-Sor, has been accused of {{opposing}} the government since October 31. If Aden Saran-Sor has joined <b>the</b> <b>ICU,</b> then the RRA and the Rahanweyn clan as a whole will be divided between ICU supporters and government supporters, with the critical military support being on <b>the</b> <b>ICU</b> side. The government's base in Baidoa is hosted by Rahanweyn-controlled Southwestern Somalia, and if Southwestern Somalia falls to <b>the</b> <b>ICU,</b> Baidoa will be entirely encircled, and local resistance to the capture of Baidoa would be muted if the locals support <b>the</b> <b>ICU.</b>|$|E

40|$|The factors {{associated}} with policies for allowing visitors into intensive care units (ICUs) are a debated issue in the nursing literature. The aim of this survey was to describe visiting policies in <b>the</b> <b>ICUs</b> of North-East Italy and to verify the hypothesis of an association between attitudes regarding accessibility to visitors and environmental, organisational or logistic variables. Data were collected by means of questionnaires sent by mail to head nurses of <b>ICUs.</b> <b>The</b> questionnaires were completed for 104 of <b>the</b> 110 <b>ICUs</b> contacted (94. 5 %). Visiting hours were generally less than 4 h a day (86 %) and only 14 % of <b>the</b> <b>ICUs</b> reported imposing no restrictions. Children under 12 years old were rarely admitted (22 %). Twenty-one percent of <b>the</b> <b>ICUs</b> reported always allowing exceptions, while 77 % did so only under 'particular' circumstances. Visiting times were not associated with logistic and organisational factors, but rather with <b>the</b> type of <b>ICU</b> (p= 0. 000), city setting (p= 0. 009), exceptions to rules (p= 0. 029), allowing {{more than one person}} (p= 0. 016) and opening to children (p= 0. 001). Restrictive visiting policies emerged; paediatric units were generally more flexible. The association between the variables regarding visiting policy, such as visiting times and exceptions to rules, or allowing more than one person or children, seem to confirm how the rules are influenced mainly by the staff's attitude, which could be changed by continuing professional education...|$|R
30|$|Conclusion After {{adjustment}} {{on center}} variables, there was neither {{significant change in}} the overall incidence of S. aureus BSI nor in the incidence of MSSA BSI in <b>ICU.</b> However, <b>the</b> incidence of MRSA BSI decreased significantly.

40|$|Background/Aim. The {{risk for}} {{nosocomial}} infections (NIs) is 5 - 10 times higher in patients hospitalized in the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) than in patients staying in other wards. The higher incidence rates of NIs in <b>the</b> <b>ICUs</b> {{may be explained}} by the fact that the patients in <b>the</b> <b>ICUs</b> have more severe underlying disease, and are exposed to the invasive diagnostic and therapeutical procedures. The unreasonable use of antibiotics leads to the selection of multiresistant agents, which have been increasingly recorded as the NIs causative agents. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of NIs in <b>the</b> <b>ICUs</b> in <b>the</b> period January-June 2005. Methods. The study of incidence was performed in accordance with the methodology of the Centers for Diseases and Prevention. Any infections in the patients hospitalized in <b>the</b> <b>ICUs</b> in <b>the</b> period from January to June 2005 were registered. The results both from medical documentation and from the direct contacts with the medical personnel were analyzed. The samples were tested using standard methods in the microbiological laboratory. Results. The incidence rates of NIs patients ranged from 1. 5 to 40. 8, and the incidence rates of infections were 1. 5 to 65. 6 per 1 000 patient’s days. Out of the total number of NIs, urinary infections accounted for 44. 6 %, blood infections for 37. 6 %, and surgical site infections for 16. 9 %. Conclusion. The most frequent cause of nosocomial urinary infections was Klebsiella, of nosocomial sepsis - coagulase − negative staphylococci, and of surgical site infections - Staphylococcus aureus...|$|R
