5|$|On 30 May 2010—the fifth {{anniversary of}} Holloway's disappearance—Stephany Tatiana Flores Ramírez, 21, {{died at the}} Hotel TAC, in the Miraflores District of Lima, Peru. On 2 June, a hotel {{employee}} found her beaten body in Room 309, which had been registered in Van der Sloot's name. He had departed from the hotel without returning the room key and left the television running. A tennis racquet, identified by the coroner as a possible homicide weapon, was recovered from the room. A hotel guest and an employee came forward <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> saw Van der Sloot and the victim entering the hotel room together, and the police obtained video of the two playing cards {{at the same table}} the night before at the Atlantic City Casino in Lima. Van der Sloot had entered Peru via Colombia on 14 May 2010 to attend the Latin American Poker Tour.|$|E
5|$|Ternent allowed Swan {{to play on}} a month-to-month {{contract}} for the 1999–2000 season. Swan rushed his nine-month recovery period down to seven months and was playing and living on painkillers. He secretly used suppositories to stop himself from passing blood after his stomach began rejecting the painkillers. Fighting a losing battle against injuries, in March 2000 Ternent allowed {{him to leave the}} club. Before he took the decision, Swan and Ronnie Jepson began to polish the boots of legendary new signing Ian Wright – just to be able <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> had done so. Five days after leaving Burnley he went to York City in the fourth tier. This reunited him with former manager Terry Dolan, who offered him a contract {{until the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they have been there for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders in out of the rain and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E

5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E

25|$|Alcoholism {{usually has}} strong {{negative}} effects on marital relationships. Separated and divorced {{men and women were}} three times as likely as married men and women <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> had been married to an alcoholic or problem drinker. Almost two-thirds of separated and divorced women, and almost half of separated or divorced men under age 46 have been exposed to alcoholism in the family at some time.|$|E
25|$|It {{was known}} to the ancient Greeks that square roots of {{positive}} whole numbers that are not perfect squares are always irrational numbers: numbers not expressible as a ratio of two integers (that is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> cannot be written exactly as m/n, where m and n are integers). This is the theorem Euclid X, 9 almost certainly due to Theaetetus dating back to circa 380BC.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of crystal sets {{is that they}} are vulnerable to interference from stations near in frequency to the desired station; that is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> have low selectivity. Often two or more stations are heard simultaneously. This is because the simple tuned circuit does not reject nearby signals well; it allows a wide band of frequencies to pass through, that is, it has a large bandwidth (low Q factor) compared to modern receivers.|$|E
25|$|An {{entangled}} {{system is}} defined {{to be one}} whose quantum state cannot be factored {{as a product of}} states of its local constituents; that is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> are not individual particles but are an inseparable whole. In entanglement, one constituent cannot be fully described without considering the other(s). Note that the state of a composite system is always expressible as a sum, or superposition, of products of states of local constituents; it is entangled if this sum necessarily has more than one term.|$|E
25|$|Conversion, as {{a purely}} civil wrong, is {{distinguishable}} from both theft and unjust enrichment. Theft is obviously an act inconsistent with another's rights, and theft {{will also be}} conversion. But not all conversions are thefts because conversion requires no element of dishonesty. Conversion is also different from unjust enrichment. If one claims an unjust enrichment, {{the person who has}} another's property may always raise a change of position defense, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> have unwittingly used up the assets they were transferred. For conversion, there always must be an element of voluntarily dealing with another's property, inconsistently with their rights.|$|E

They get caught in actual bad weather and decide to pull up in a nearby island, Kjerulføya, north of Nordaustlandet. The following day they go ashore to find food but instead find a cable. They follow the cable until they find a Soviet bearing station. While at the station, they are discovered by the Russians. They return fire after being shot at, killing a Russian; Sverre is wounded.|$|E
25|$|He also {{introduced}} {{the notion of}} a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a Universal Turing machine), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other machine, or in other words, it is provably capable of computing anything that is computable by executing a program stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper. Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be Turing-complete, which is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>they</b> have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine.|$|E

25|$|Another {{experiment}} {{involved an}} electronic ouija board where the device's movements were manipulated by the experimenter, while {{the participant was}} led to believe they were entirely self-conducted. The experimenter stopped the device on occasions and asked the participant how much they themselves felt like they wanted to stop. The participant also listened to words in headphones; and {{it was found that}} if experimenter stopped next to an object that came through the headphones they were more likely <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> wanted to stop there. If the participant perceived having the thought {{at the time of the}} action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires; priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses).|$|E
25|$|Slemmer and Gilman {{stepped aside}} and soon {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> would reply the next day. Slemmer asked Chase {{how many men}} he had, whether he could take the fort by storm and how many men {{he thought he would}} lose. Chase replied that he could take the fort but supposed he might lose half of his force. Slemmer responded that he did not believe Chase was willing to make that sacrifice. Chase said that Slemmer must know that Florida could not permit the fort to be held and that an attack would start a civil war. Slemmer said he wanted to consult with the captains of two U.S. Navy vessels in the harbor. The next day, as the Navy vessels withdrew, Slemmer refused the demand for surrender of the fort. He refused a similar demand from Chase on January 18, 1861.|$|E
25|$|Many critics hold postmodern art {{emerges from}} modern art. Suggested dates for {{the shift from}} modern to postmodern include 1914 in Europe, and 1962 or 1968 in America. James Elkins, commenting on discussions about the exact date of the {{transition}} from modernism to postmodernism, compares it to the discussion in the 1960s about the exact span of Mannerism and whether it should begin directly after the High Renaissance or later in the century. He makes the point these debates go {{on all the time}} with respect to art movements and periods, which is not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> are not important. The close of the period of postmodern art has been dated {{to the end of the}} 1980s, when the word postmodernism lost much of its critical resonance, and art practices began to address the impact of globalization and new media.|$|E
