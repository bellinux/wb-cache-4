5|$|Although {{they were}} {{excluded}} from the formal rituals of the temple, laymen still sought <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> gods. There is little evidence of the religious practices of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom or later periods. The evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary Egyptians used many venues <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> divine, such as household shrines or community chapels, the official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration.|$|E

5|$|Avatar, {{marketed as}} James Cameron's Avatar, is a 2009 American epic science fiction film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron, and {{starring}} Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney Weaver. The film {{is set in}} the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the mineral unobtanium, a room-temperature superconductor. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'viâ€“ a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora.

5|$|It {{originated}} {{in an area}} of low pressure that developed over the western Gulf of Mexico on December10, downstream from an upper-level cyclone. The surface low tracked northward to Oklahoma before turning eastward as it gradually intensified. Simultaneously, a shortwave trough swung southeastward around the periphery of a large vortex over central and eastern Canada. As the upper low opened up into a negatively tilted trough and began <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> northern wave, a secondary surface cyclone developed along a frontal boundary over South Carolina late on December11. Almost immediately thereafter, the original low dissipated over West Virginia. Heading toward the northeast, the incipient storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, at 00:00UTC on December12.|$|E
5|$|PHP 5 {{introduced}} {{private and}} protected member variables and methods, along with abstract classes, final classes, abstract methods, and final methods. It also introduced a standard way of declaring constructors and destructors, {{similar to that}} of other object-oriented languages such as C++, and a standard exception handling model. Furthermore, PHP 5 added interfaces and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> runtime system. Objects implementing ArrayAccess can be used with array syntax and objects implementing Iterator or IteratorAggregate can be used with the foreach language construct. There is no virtual table feature in the engine, so static variables are bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil: Revelations is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> environment and enemies. In the game's single-player campaign, the player must complete {{a series of}} scenarios collected together into episodes. Most of the scenarios involve the player controlling Jill Valentine aboard a ghost ship in the Mediterranean Sea, but some require the player to play as other characters in different settings. To finish a scenario and proceed to the next one, the player must complete certain objectives such as solving puzzles, defeating a boss, collecting keys that open doors to new areas, and reaching a specific point in the game, among others.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after peaking in strength, Cindy began <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{mountains}} of nearby Hispaniola. The high terrain disrupted its circulation, {{causing it to}} weaken to a tropical depression at 21:00UTC on August16. The depression made landfall near Barahona, Dominican Republic, with winds of 35mph (55km/h). It became increasingly disorganized over land, prompting the NHC to declassify it as a tropical cyclone on August17. The remnants proceeded inland near the border with Haiti and emerged into the Atlantic, where they spread across the Bahamas before eventually dissipating the next day.|$|E
5|$|The Metroid series {{contains}} gameplay {{elements from}} shooter, platformer, and adventure games. The series is notable for its non-linear progression and solitary exploration format where the player only controls Samus Aran, with {{few or no}} other characters <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with.</b> <b>The</b> series has been a 2D side-scroller in all its incarnations until the Metroid Prime series changed the perspective to a first-person perspective, leading to a new first-person shooter element. The player gains items and power-ups for Samus's cybernetic suit primarily through exploration, and occasionally by defeating alien creatures through real-time combat with the suit's arm cannon. Many such upgrades enable further avenues of exploration. A recurring upgrade is the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to curl into a ball, roll into tight places and plant bombs.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} in fusion {{involves}} the high-affinity attachment of the CD4 binding domains of gp120 to CD4. Once gp120 is bound with the CD4 protein, the envelope complex undergoes a structural change, exposing the chemokine receptor binding domains of gp120 and allowing them <b>to</b> <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> target chemokine receptor. This allows for a more stable two-pronged attachment, which allows the N-terminal fusion peptide gp41 to penetrate the cell membrane. Repeat sequences in gp41, HR1, and HR2 then interact, causing {{the collapse of the}} extracellular portion of gp41 into a hairpin. This loop structure brings the virus and cell membranes close together, allowing fusion of the membranes and subsequent entry of the viral capsid.|$|E
