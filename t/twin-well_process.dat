To enhance the compatibility with VLSI processing, the buried injector is formed by the local overlap of the n-well and p-well of a retrograde <b>twin-well</b> CMOS <b>process.</b> The injector is activated by means of punchthrough.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a low-dropout regulator (LDO) for portable applications with an impedance-attenuated buffer for driving the pass device. Dynamically-biased shunt feedback is {{proposed in the}} buffer to lower its output resistance such that the pole at {{the gate of the}} pass device is pushed to high frequencies without dissipating large quiescent current. By employing the current-buffer compensation, only a single pole is realized within the regulation loop unity-gain bandwidth and over 65 phase margin is achieved under the full range of the load current in the LDO. The LDO thus achieves stability without using any low-frequency zero. The maximum output-voltage variation can be minimized during load transients even if a small output capacitor is used. The LDO with the proposed impedance-attenuated buffer has been implemented in a 0. 35 - m <b>twin-well</b> CMOS <b>process.</b> The proposed LDO dissipates 20 - A quiescent current at no-load condition and is able to deliver up to 200 -mA load current. With a 1 -F output capacitor, the maximum transient output-voltage variation is within 3 % of the output voltage with load step changes of 200 mA/ 100 ns.
