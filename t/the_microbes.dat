5|$|In September 2009, {{the most}} common type of microbe on the surface of Lake Chillisquaque was Oscillatoria, which made up {{approximately}} 75 percent of the total. Raphidiopsis was the second most common type, making up approximately 15 percent of the total. In May 2010, approximately 40 percent of <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> were Navicula and 35 percent were Oscillatoria. Slightly less than 10 percent of <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> are Anabaena. In July 2010, Oscillatoria and Synechococcus each made up approximately 25 percent of <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> and between 10 and 15 percent were Anabaena.|$|E
5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E
5|$|Like other wattles, Acacia pycnantha fixes {{nitrogen}} {{from the}} atmosphere. It hosts bacteria known as rhizobia that form root nodules, where they make nitrogen available in organic form and thus help the plant grow in poor soils. A field study across Australia and South Africa found that <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> are genetically diverse, belonging to various {{strains of the}} species Bradyrhizobium japonicum and genus Burkholderia in both countries. It is unclear whether the golden wattle was accompanied by the bacteria to the African continent or encountered new populations there.|$|E
50|$|Artificial active {{immunization}} is where <b>the</b> <b>microbe</b> is {{injected into the}} person before {{they are able to}} take it in naturally. <b>The</b> <b>microbe</b> is treated, so that it will not harm the infected person. Depending on the type of disease, this technique also works with dead <b>microbes,</b> parts of <b>the</b> <b>microbe,</b> or treated toxins from <b>the</b> <b>microbe.</b> A common example of this form of {{active immunization}} is vaccinations, which have led to several controversies in the past and even present regarding their safety.|$|R
50|$|Active {{immunization}} {{can occur}} naturally when a microbe or other antigen is received {{by a person}} who has not yet come into contact with <b>the</b> <b>microbe</b> and has no pre-made antibodies for defense. The immune system will eventually create antibodies for <b>the</b> <b>microbe,</b> but this is a slow process and, if <b>the</b> <b>microbe</b> is deadly, there may not be enough time for the antibodies to be used.|$|R

5|$|The termite gut has {{inspired}} various research efforts aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable energy sources. Termites are efficient bioreactors, {{capable of producing}} two litres of hydrogen from a single sheet of paper. Approximately 200 species of microbes live inside the termite hindgut, releasing the hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest. Through the action of unidentified enzymes in the termite gut, lignocellulose polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen. The bacteria within the gut turns the sugar and hydrogen into cellulose acetate, an acetate ester of cellulose on which termites rely for energy. Community DNA sequencing of <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> in the termite hindgut has been employed to provide {{a better understanding of}} the metabolic pathway. Genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from woody biomass.|$|E
25|$|Cattle are {{classified}} as ruminants because of the amazing construction of their digestive tract. Their symbiotic relationship with <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> that occupy the fermentation chamber in their stomach, the rumen, allows them to survive on incredibly low quality feed. The rumen is a micro-ecosystem within each dairy cow. For optimal digestion, {{the environment of the}} rumen must be ideal for <b>the</b> <b>microbes.</b> In this way, the job of a ruminant nutritionist is to feed <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> not the cow.|$|E
25|$|Cimex lectularius {{males have}} {{environmental}} microbes on their genitals. These microbes damage sperm cells, leaving them unable to fertilize female gametes. Due to these dangerous microbes, males have evolved antimicrobial ejaculate substances that prevent sperm damage. When <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> contact sperm or the male genitals, the bed bug releases antimicrobial substances. Many species of these microbes {{live in the}} bodies of females after mating. <b>The</b> <b>microbes</b> can cause infections in the females. It {{has been suggested that}} females receive benefit from the ejaculate. Though the benefit is not direct, females are able to produce more eggs than optimum increasing the amount of the females' genes in the gene pool.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>microbe</b> {{was named}} by two {{children}} {{who took part}} in a naming contest held by the discoverers of the organism in 2006; the children independently suggested salsolis as the species name for <b>the</b> <b>microbe.</b>|$|R

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that copper alloy {{surfaces}} kill E. coli O157:H7. Over 99.9% of E. coli microbes are killed after just 1–2 hours on copper. On stainless steel surfaces, <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> can survive for weeks.|$|E
25|$|Organosilane {{coatings}} {{create a}} nanocoating {{that is highly}} abrasive to virus, bacteria, and fungi that is undetectable to humans, but rips the outer membrane of <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> attempting to attach to the surface. This is a mechanical action to which {{there can be no}} immunity. Organosilanes leave a non-toxic permanent coating that works with or without light.|$|E
25|$|The best-known {{types of}} {{microbial}} mat may be flat laminated mats, which form on approximately horizontal surfaces, and stromatolites, stubby pillars built as <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> slowly move upwards {{to avoid being}} smothered by sediment deposited on them by water. However, there are also spherical mats, some {{on the outside of}} pellets of rock or other firm material and others inside spheres of sediment.|$|E
50|$|Microbial iron {{transport}} (siderophore)-mediated {{drug delivery}} {{makes use of}} the recognition of siderophores as iron delivery agents {{in order to have}} <b>the</b> <b>microbe</b> assimilate siderophore conjugates with attached drugs. These drugs are lethal to <b>the</b> <b>microbe</b> and cause <b>the</b> <b>microbe</b> to apoptosise when it assimilates the siderophore conjugate. Through the addition of the iron-binding functional groups of siderophores into antibiotics, their potency has been greatly increased. This is due to the siderophore-mediated iron uptake system of the bacteria.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>microbe</b> theory's proponents {{argue that}} it would better explain the rapid, but continual, rise of carbon isotope level in period {{sediment}} deposits than volcanic eruption, which causes a spike in carbon levels followed by a slow decline. [...] <b>The</b> <b>microbe</b> theory suggests that volcanic activity played a different role - supplying the nickel which Methanosarcina required as a cofactor. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>microbe</b> theory holds that Siberian volcanic activity was a catalyst for, but not {{the primary cause of}} the mass extinction.|$|R

25|$|In 2015 {{researchers}} {{announced an}} SMFC application that extracts energy and charges a battery. Salts dissociate into positively and negatively charged ions {{in water and}} move and adhere to the respective negative and positive electrodes, charging the battery and {{making it possible to}} remove the salt effecting microbial capacitive desalination. <b>The</b> <b>microbes</b> produce more energy than is required for the desalination process.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of biodrying, the waste {{material}} undergoes a period of rapid heating through the action of aerobic microbes. During this partial composting stage the heat generated by <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> result in rapid drying of the waste. These systems are often configured to produce a refuse-derived fuel where a dry, light material is advantageous for later transport and combustion.|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} laid around the crab's {{compound}} eyes, {{and the first}} instar larvae which hatch from the eggs migrate to the crab's nephritic pad, and live there, feeding on <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> that cleanse the crab's urine. The second instar is spent in the crab's gill chamber. The third instar sees the larvae return to the mouthparts before falling to the ground to pupate.|$|E

50|$|In {{this version}} of the episode, Rimmer {{successfully}} remembers the antidote to <b>the</b> <b>microbe</b> that is eating the ship. It takes him over two hours to memorise the name of the antidote, as he has to alternate between the mirror universe and back to read the name of the antidote (which becomes the chemical name of <b>the</b> <b>microbe</b> in our universe as the opposite of the antidote.) However, Rimmer memorises the antidote just in time for Kryten to make up some of the chemical antidote and use it to destroy <b>the</b> <b>microbe,</b> with irony included as everyone else already knew its name.|$|R
25|$|Digestate is {{the solid}} {{remnants}} of the original input material to the digesters that <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> cannot use. It also consists of the mineralised remains of the dead bacteria from within the digesters. Digestate can come in three forms: fibrous, liquor, or a sludge-based {{combination of the two}} fractions. In two-stage systems, different forms of digestate come from different digestion tanks. In single-stage digestion systems, the two fractions will be combined and, if desired, separated by further processing.|$|E
25|$|The {{terminal}} {{stage of}} anaerobic digestion is the biological process of methanogenesis. Here, methanogens use the intermediate {{products of the}} preceding stages and convert them into methane, carbon dioxide, and water. These components make {{up the majority of}} the biogas emitted from the system. Methanogenesis is sensitive to both high and low pHs and occurs between pH 6.5 and pH 8. The remaining, indigestible material <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> cannot use and any dead bacterial remains constitute the digestate.|$|E
25|$|Considered a very {{versatile}} {{host for}} the production of heterologous proteins, researchers can introduce genes into <b>the</b> <b>microbes</b> using plasmids, allowing for the mass production of proteins in industrial fermentation processes. Genetic systems have also been developed which allow the production of recombinant proteins using E. coli. One of the first useful applications of recombinant DNA technology was the manipulation of E. coli to produce human insulin. Modified E. coli have been used in vaccine development, bioremediation, and production of immobilised enzymes.|$|E

5000|$|The pH of the {{environment}} can support growth or hinder neutrophilic organisms. When the pH is within <b>the</b> <b>microbe's</b> range, they grow and within that range there is an optimal growth pH. [...] Neutrophiles are adapted {{to live in an}} environment where the hydrogen ion concentration is at equilibrium. [...] They are sensitive to the concentration, and when the pH become too basic or acidic, the cell's proteins can denature. [...] In acidic conditions, neutrophiles have a few defenses including decreasing membrane fluidity, repairing DNA that has been damaged, and increasing the pH of {{the environment}} surrounding it. [...] Depending on <b>the</b> <b>microbe</b> and <b>the</b> pH, <b>the</b> <b>microbe's</b> growth can be slowed or stopped altogether. [...] Manipulation of the pH {{of the environment}} that <b>the</b> <b>microbe</b> is in is used by the food industry to control its growth in order to increase the shelf life of food.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Terephthalic acid {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{contaminations}} released by PET processing and it's toxic to environment and animals. Useful microbe must be found out to biodegrade it. Bacillus came from waste water may be powerful to biodegrade it, so the waste water were used as the sources of bacillus. <b>The</b> <b>microbe</b> was enriched in enrichment medium first and then isolated on selective medium containing terephthalic acid as the only carbon source to get <b>the</b> <b>microbe</b> suitable for degradation. <b>The</b> purified <b>microbe</b> was used to biodegrade terephthalic acid at different temperature to find out its suitable living and degradation condition. <b>The</b> <b>microbe</b> was identified with molecule biological identification and biolog express identification. The fermentation condition of <b>the</b> purified <b>microbe</b> was studied. <b>The</b> enzyme activity, growth condition and degradation condition was studied. The results showed that <b>the</b> isolated <b>microbe</b> was a kind of bacillus named comamonas testosteroni. It's powerful to degrade terephthalic acid at 37 ℃ with the rotational speed of 200 rpm. The pH of the medium would increase during degradation of substrate. The degradation would consumed a lot of oxygen. A degradation path may be deduced...|$|R
25|$|The German {{physicist}} Claudius Gros has proposed, {{that the}} technology developed by the Breakthrough Starshot initiative may be utilized in a second step to establish a biosphere of unicellular microbes on otherwise only transiently habitable exoplanets. The aim of this initiative, the Genesis project, would be to fast forward evolution to a stage equivalent of the precambrian period on earth. Gros argues, that the Genesis project would be realizable within 50-100 year, using low-weight probes equipped with a miniaturized gene laboratory for the in situ synthesis of <b>the</b> <b>microbes.</b> The Genesis project extends directed panspermia to eukaryotic life.|$|E
25|$|The lake gained {{widespread}} {{recognition in}} December 2002 when a research team, {{led by the}} University of Illinois at Chicago's Peter Doran, announced the discovery of 2,800‑year‑old halophile microbes (primarily filamentous cyanobacteria) preserved in ice layer core samples drilled in 1996. <b>The</b> <b>microbes</b> reanimated upon thawing, grew and reproduced.
