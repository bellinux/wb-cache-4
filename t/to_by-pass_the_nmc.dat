50|$|In 1895 {{promoters}} {{associated with}} the Barry Railway proposed a London and South Wales Railway. This was <b>to</b> <b>by-pass</b> <b>the</b> Great Western Railway by building a new line from Cogan, near Cardiff, to the Metropolitan Railway north of London. The motivation in this was dissatisfaction with the Great Western Railway, which had a monopoly of rail transport from South Wales to London and Salisbury.|$|R

Most traffic was now generated from services to Mount Morgan, St Lawrence, and the Sunday-only train to Mackay.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{company had}} its own station master and staff, and its own signalbox and booking office. Some L&SWR trains were {{diverted}} <b>to</b> <b>by-pass</b> <b>the</b> original Town station, and from 1871 an unmanned platform with a shelter was provided on the Joint line adjacent to the Town station.

5000|$|As Governor, he {{negotiated}} with the Emirati oil companies, Crescent Petroleum and Dana Gas to develop Anbar's Akkas gas field.

50|$|The {{main line}} {{was in new}} {{construction}} from Penzance to a point near Trenowin Farm, east of Angarrack, then using the Hayle Railway route to near the Redruth station, but with a short new section <b>to</b> <b>by-pass</b> <b>the</b> Penponds inclined plane. From Redruth there was new construction (with a new, more central station at that town) to a terminal station about a mile west of Truro. This was at Higher Town, but its official name was Truro Road, although MacDermot uses the name Higher Town.|$|R
50|$|Between 1904 and 1907 the Barry Railway planned an {{extension}} railway <b>to</b> <b>by-pass</b> <b>the</b> Rhymney Railway section, and to reach Newport over the B&M Railway, {{and this was}} authorised by Act of 28 August 1907. However there were considerable limitations, particularly on rate competition, and the Barry Railway saw that this expensive line would not be profitable, and it delayed construction, hoping to negotiate better terms with its competitors. The delay continued right up until 1914, when the outbreak of World War I prevented the realisation of major new schemes.|$|R
50|$|In July 2009 he was {{transferred}} to Pro Vercelli after a short period with Bnei Sakhnin, which at that time he obtained a Portuguese passport, made him able <b>to</b> <b>by-pass</b> <b>the</b> non-EU immigration ban of Italian lower divisions, along with countryman Adriano da Matta Inácio. His contract was terminated in January 2010. In February, he was signed by Guarani in 1-year deal, and in June left for Santo André, also in 1-year deal. However, after 7 appearances in 2010 Campeonato Brasileiro Série B, he was released in October.|$|R
