30|$|Capacity is {{increased}} by higher operational speeds and train frequencies provided by DTO systems, where the headway {{can be reduced}} to 75  s, even to 60  s [19, 20]. In addition, DTO systems can reduce the <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> <b>at</b> the <b>terminus</b> to enable higher frequency. Therefore, additional trains can be put into the system during the peak hours to transport passengers. Moreover, DTO systems can respond immediately to congestion, running more trains without the need for extra staff. In addition, the frequency of the trains can also be enhanced in the low-traffic hours, as more and shorter trains can be inserted in traffic without the need for operational staff. Shorter headways provided by DTO systems reduce the expected waiting times of passengers. Additionally, more frequent arrivals of trains at platforms also shorten the boarding and alighting process, which results in shorter dwell times. It is stated in [7] that if the headway between trains is reduced by 42  s, then the dwell time is about 3 % less. In addition, better regularity and consistency of station stop times are also enabled by the improvements in frequency for DTO systems, while human factors can create variability and small delays in GoA 2 and GoA 3 lines [21]. The Paris Metro reported that after upgrading the traditional metro system of Line 1 to DTO system, the same level of service can be provided by fewer rolling stock units [19]. Moreover, the removal of the driver cabins enhances the physical space for passengers, which added 6 % to capacity for Paris Metro Line 1 [19].|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedModern aircraft design allows for short <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> {{by removing the}} failed component and installing an operational one. The defective component is then either repaired in the squadron or turned in to supply which then sends the defective component to an Intermediate Maintenance Activity (IMA) for repair. The aircraft is unable to be turned around for another flight if supply is out of stock of that component without resorting to additional maintenance measures. This is when aircraft readiness experiences a measurable deterioration due to supply not having the part on hand.

Taking advantage of the variations in the transport characteristics in each origin-destination airports pair, the paper uses a discrete choice model to describe the transshipping route choice decision made by an agent (i. e., freight forwarder, consolidator, and large shipper). The analysis incorporates two major factors, monetary cost (such as line-haul cost and landing fee) and time cost (i. e., aircraft <b>turnaround</b> <b>time,</b> including loading and unloading time, custom clearance time, and expected scheduled delay), along with other controls. The estimation method considers the presence of unobserved attributes, and corrects for resulting endogeneity by use of appropriate instrumental variables. Estimation results find that transshipment volumes are more sensitive to time cost, and that the reduction in aircraft <b>turnaround</b> <b>time</b> by 1 hour would be worth the increase in airport charges by more than $ 1000.

To evaluate patient satisfaction with the turn around times. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed to evaluate the time intervals from abnormal screening mammogram to diagnostic mammogram, diagnostic mammogram to biopsy, biopsy to MRI, and MRI to surgery of all patients seen for breast cancer in 2009. A patient survey was mailed out to all patients (131) managed from abnormal screening to surgery in 2009, assessing their satisfaction with the <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> from screening mammogram to call back, call back to diagnostic mammogram, diagnostic mammogram to biopsy, biopsy to results call, biopsy result to MRI appointment, MRI appointment to surgery consult, and surgery consult to surgery; and assessing possible reasons why patients may perceive the process to be delayed. The MEANS procedure was applied to evaluate the <b>turnaround</b> <b>times,</b> and a Box and Whisker Plot statistical comparison was made between patient satisfaction and <b>turnaround</b> <b>times.</b> Results: The mean <b>turnaround</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> the CCBCC in 2009 from abnormal screening mammogram to surgery was 45 d. This falls within the 75 th %ile of the National Quality Measures for Breast Centers (NQMBC), established by the National Consortium of Breast Centers (NCBC). Of 131 surveys mailed out, 57 were returned (44 %). The patient satisfaction rates for each interval ranged from 96 %– 100 %, with an overall satisfaction rate of 98 % for abnormal screening mammogram to surgery.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Ship <b>turnaround</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> {{a marine}} containerport is an {{important}} measure of the port's efficiency and attractiveness. Both the speed and quality of load planning affect the length of <b>turnaround</b> <b>time</b> considerably. Past attempts at computerizing the load planning function have been unsatisfactory and have not reflected the port's objective of optimally utilizing its facilities and equipment. The computerized model developed through this study generates optimum feasible load plans that minimize yard material handling of containers while meeting all ship stability and loading restrictions. The model is particularly addressed to containerports with transtainers as prime yard movers. Minimization of yard handling is accomplished through formulation of the transtainer routing problem as a dynamic programming problem. The set of shipboard container-cell assignments is then checked against the constraints. Pairwise exchanges of assignments are made to meet any violated constraint so that the yard handling increase is minimized. The model has been tested using data for five actual ship loadings at Port of Portland. It yielded feasible load plans that were better than those manually generated showing an average 3. 2 percent less material handling requirements. The model can be easily implemented at containerports with medium-to-large computers with some adjustments. The success of this study not only provides a way of increasing port productivity, but also makes available an important software component for a port automation system...|$|R

40|$|The ship <b>turnaround</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> {{container}} terminals {{is an important}} measure of a port's efficiency and attractiveness. The speed and quality of load planning affect the length of <b>turnaround</b> <b>time</b> considerably. Container operations are extremely important from an economic standpoint, making them a prime target for productivity improvements. In addition, load planning {{is a very complex}} problem, since the planners have to account for the stability of the ship and rely on a variety of other stochastic processes. Unfortunately, the load-planning problem is NP-hard making it difficult to obtain an optimal solution in polynomial time. Heuristics that trade quality for tractability are therefore promising tools when coping with this problem. Efficient load planning is accomplished by formulating the stowage-planning model to minimize extra shifting as a mixed integer-programming problem. The key contributions of this dissertation are as follows. 	A mathematical model is developed which considers real life constraints and considering loading/unloading along the entire voyage. 	A second mathematical model is formulated to obtain a lower bound on the value of the objective function of the exact solution. 	A heuristic procedure is developed that is guide by practical considerations that account for the structure of the stowage-planning problem. All proposed mathematical models and heuristic are validated with experimental results. In all cases, these results demonstrate the stability, flexibility and efficiency of the model, and establish its potential as a versatile and practical method for large scale container loading...|$|R

40|$|Emergency Medical Services (EMS) play {{a pivotal}} role in any {{healthcare}} organisation. Response and <b>turnaround</b> <b>time</b> targets are always of great concern for the Welsh Ambulance NHS Trust (WAST). In particular, the more rural areas in South East Wales consistently perform poorly with respect to Government set response standards, whilst delayed transfer of care to Emergency Departments (EDs) is a problem publicised extensively in recent years. Many Trusts, including WAST, are additionally moving towards clinical outcome based performance measures, allowing an alternative system-evaluation approach to the traditional response threshold led strategies, resulting in a more patient centred system. Three main investigative parts form this thesis, culminating in a suite of operational and strategic decision support tools to aid EMS managers. Firstly, four novel allocation model methods are developed to provide vehicle allocations to existing stations whilst maximising patient survival. A detailed simulation model then evaluates clinical outcomes given a survival based (compared to response target based) allocation, determining also the impact of the fleet, its location and a variety of system changes of interest to WAST (through ‘what-if?’ style experimentation) on entire system performance. Additionally, a developed travel time matrix generator tool, enabling the calculation and/or prediction of journey times between all pairs of locations from route distances is utilised within the aforementioned models. The conclusions of the experimentation and investigative processes suggest system improvements can in fact come from better allocating vehicles across the region, by reducing <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> <b>at</b> hospital facilities and, in application to South East Wales, through alternative operational policies without the need to increase resources.

This is particularly the case for timetables with 'backloading', or 'padding', which is when extra minutes are built into the final leg of the journey as 'catch-up' <b>time.</b> While <b>time</b> <b>at</b> the <b>terminus</b> is important for morning commuter trains into a city, when most passengers alight <b>at</b> the <b>terminus,</b> for inter-city trains, cross-country trains, and evening commuter trains out of a city, it is irrelevant to most passengers, who will alight at different points along the journey.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Our {{purpose was}} to {{understand}} how social workers experience the possible complexities that working with economical aid can entail. As an example we chose to focus on long-term economical aid work. We aimed {{to address the question}} of which factors could affect their work. In a prior study, done by Dellgran & Höjer (2003) the conclusion was drawn  that  the combination of economical aid, healthcare and schools makeup a third of  practical social work in the terms of the proportion of the amount of social workers, but only 8 percent of the research is done in those areas. Other studies (Stranz, 2007) demonstrate that the research that is done on working with economical aid is deficient. We interviewed six social workers in two smaller municipalities in the southern of Sweden. Our result indicated that the social workers felt pressured by their work-load {{and the fact that the}} amount of new cases had increased. They thought that a possible reason for this could be the weak economic climate and changes in the labour market policies. They also felt that alterations and long office <b>turnaround</b> <b>times</b> <b>at</b> other administrative authorities also contributed.  The results showed that the majority of the social workers in our study used a motivational approach in their meetings with clients and they also had the best interest in mind for each and every client. We chose to use the theoretical perspectives of Human service organizations by Yeheskel Hasenfeld (1983) and Demokratins väktare (our translation: the guardians of democracy) by Lennart Lundquist (1998) when we analyzed our results.   Keywords: Economical aid, social workers, long-termed economical aid, human service organizations...|$|R
