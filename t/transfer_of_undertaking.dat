50|$|Where {{outsourcing}} {{involves the}} <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> an <b>undertaking,</b> it {{is subject to}} Council Directive 77/187 of 14 February 1977, on the approximation {{of the laws of}} the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees’ rights in the event <b>of</b> <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses (as amended by Directive 98/50/EC of 29 June 1998; consolidated in Directive 2001/23 of 12 March 2001). Under that directive, rights acquired by employees with the former employer are to be safeguarded when they, together with the undertaking in which they are employed, are transferred to another employer, i.e., the contractor. An example of a case involving such contracting-out was the decision of the European Court of Justice in Christel Schmidt v. Spar- und Leihkasse der früheren Ämter Bordesholm, Kiel und Cronshagen, Case C-392/92 1994. Although subsequent decisions have disputed whether a particular contracting-out exercise constituted a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> an <b>undertaking</b> (see, for example, Ayse Süzen v.

In addition, it is regulated under Czech law, mostly by articles 338 - 342 of the Czech Labour Code No. 262 / 2006 Coll.

The provisions regarding transferof undertaking or business is found in the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>undertaking</b> or business directive, 6 b § LAS and 28 § MBL. An employee’s employment is automatically transferred to the transferee. This includes theemployment contract and the employment relationship as it were at the time of the transfer.

40|$|The swedish law of {{contract}} is fundamental within several civil law areas, among others labour law.

40|$|Thesis (LLM (Mercantile Law)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{freedom to}} {{transfer}} an <b>undertaking</b> is part <b>of</b> the employer’s freedom of contract. The transferee <b>of</b> an <b>undertaking</b> under {{the common law}} {{has the right to}} choose whether he wants to contract with employees or not. By the implementation of section 197 of the Labour Relations Act (1995) and the amended sections 197, 197 A of the Labour Relations Act (2002) the legislator provides for an automatic transfer in cases where the undertaking is transferred as a going concern. The former accordance with the regulations of the insolvency law and the fact that sequestration or the winding-up <b>of</b> an insolvent <b>undertaking</b> had to be to the advantage of the creditors was lost after the legislative steps of 1995. The effects of the above-mentioned sections and especially the problems regarding the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> insolvent undertakings shall be analysed in this thesis. It is the aim of this thesis to examine how sections 197, 197 A of the Labour Relations Act and section 38 of the Insolvency Act should be applied and interpreted to achieve social justice. This makes it necessary to examine the history and development of the South African law <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> an insolvent <b>undertaking</b> too.

After the introduction contained in the first chapter, the second chapter deals with the legal definition <b>of</b> an <b>Undertaking</b> and its part. The concept <b>of</b> <b>Undertaking</b> described in the Czech Commercial Code is broadly constructed in order to cover many different components as a part <b>of</b> any <b>Undertaking.</b> The important distinction between the European law and the laws of the Czech Republic is that the Czech law understands the undertaking merely as a specific object of legal relations. The European law, however, recognized the Undertaking as a subject of legal relations. The third chapter identifies other contract types which could cause the same results as the sale of undertaking; among other the sales contract and specific innominated contract. The legal provisions of contract for sale <b>of</b> <b>Undertaking</b> describe the consequences of the sale and analyzed in the fourth chapter of the thesis.

40|$|When Sweden in 1995 {{became a}} member of the European Union, Swedish labour {{legislation}} was enacted on the safeguarding of employees’ rights in the event of <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>undertaking.</b> These Swedish rules and regulations are examined. EU law and national law form two parallel systems, which between themselves arrange the legal sources hierarchically, and, as a result of that, the Member States have transferred both legislative and adjudication competences to the institutions of the European Union. Therefore also EU legislation must be noted, especially Council Directive 2001 / 23 /EC and its predecessor Counsil Directive 77 / 187 /EEC, the 1977 and 2001 transfer of undertakings directive, and the case law concerning these directives. The main examination of substantive law deals with the question when the implementation rules of the transfer of undertakings directive are applicable and, to some extent, the legal effects of the applicability of the directive. The overall question concerning the directive's applicability is divided into three sub-questions. The first sub-question examines the objects that are covered by the directive and the forms of transfer to which the directive is applicable. the second sub-question concerns the significance of retained identity under the directive, and the third deals with the legal effects of the directive's rules. Automatic transfer of employment is quite new and therefore focussed as well as the provisions on prohibition of dismissals and on continuation of employment of the transferee...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is {{transfer}} of undertakings and employment protection in cases of outsourcing. The aim of the study is to examine how the Swedish law in the area relates to the EU law. This is done by comparing the Swedish case law of Arbetsdomstolen to the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and by critically reviewing the case law of Arbetsdomstolen from a gender perspective. The method used for this study is a doctrinal research method. This is supplemented with a social science perspective. Cases of outsourcing are often complex and have given rise to a lot of case law from both the Court of Justice of the EU and Arbetsdomstolen. Arbetsdomstolen has furthermore been subject to criticism for interpreting the EU directive too independently and for being too employer friendly. The results of the study show that Arbetsdomstolens assessments are different from the Court of Justice of the EU assessments in some aspects. Both courts, but Arbetsdomstolen in particular, distinguishes between undertakings that are based on material assets and undertakings that are based on personnel assets. Case law shows that a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>undertaking</b> is more likely to occur when it concerns an undertaking based on material assets. This means that Arbetsdomstolens assessments are unfavorable for employees working in undertakings based on personnel. The conclusion is therefore that, since the Swedish labor market is gender segregated, the employment protection is stronger for men than for women...|$|E

Follow up experiments indicated that passive <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> antiserum, from MVA-VP 2 immune donors to recipient mice 1 h before challenge, conferred complete clinical protection and significantly reduced viraemia. These studies have been extended to determine the protective effect of MVA-VP 2 vaccine-induced antiserum, when administered 48 h before, or 48 h after challenge. In addition, passive <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> splenocytes was <b>undertaken</b> to assess if they confer any degree of immunity to immunologically naïve recipient mice. Thus, antisera and splenocytes were collected from groups of mice that had been vaccinated with MVA-VP 2, or wild type MVA (MVA-wt), for passive immunisation of recipient mice. The latter were subsequently challenged with AHSV- 4 (together with appropriate vaccinated or unvaccinated control animals) and protection was assessed by comparing clinical signs, lethality and viraemia between treated and control groups. All antiserum recipients showed high protection against disease (100 % survival rates even in mice that were immunised 48 h after challenge) and statistically significant reduction or viraemia {{in comparison with the}} control groups. The mouse group receiving splenocytes from MVA-VP 2 vaccinates, showed only a 40 % survival rate, with a small reduction in viraemia, compared to those mice that had received splenocytes from MVA-wt vaccinates. These results confirm the primarily humoral nature of protective immunity conferred by MVA-VP 2 vaccination and show the potential of administering MVA-VP 2 specific antiserum as an emergency treatment for AHSV...|$|R
40|$|Memory {{consolidation}} for {{a trained}} sequence of finger opposition movements, in 9 - and 12 -year-old children, was recently {{found to be}} significantly less susceptible to interference by a subsequent training experience, compared to that of 17 -year-olds. It was suggested that, in children, the experience of training on any sequence of finger movements may affect the performance of the sequence elements, component movements, rather than the sequence as a unit; the latter has been implicated in the learning of the task by adults. This hypothesis implied a possible childhood advantage in the ability to transfer the gains from a trained to the reversed, untrained, sequence of movements. Here we report the results <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> tests <b>undertaken</b> to test this proposal in 9 -, 12 -, and 17 -year-olds after training in the finger-to-thumb opposition sequence (FOS) learning task. Our results show that the performance gains in the trained sequence partially transferred from the left, trained hand, to the untrained hand at 48 -hours after a single training session in the three age-groups tested. However, there was very little <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the gains from the trained to the untrained, reversed, sequence performed by either hand. The results indicate sequence specific post-training gains in FOS performance, as opposed to a general improvement in performance of the individual, component, movements that comprised both the trained and untrained sequences. These results do not support the proposal that the reduced susceptibility to interference, in children before adolescence, reflects a difference in movement syntax representation after training...|$|R
