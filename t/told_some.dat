5|$|Following the Mexican–American War, Washington {{traveled}} to California in 1849 as a Forty-niner in the California Gold Rush and authored the novel, A Tale to be <b>Told</b> <b>Some</b> Fifty Years Hence. Washington then relocated east to Missouri in the 1850s, where he remained {{for a few}} years and fought as a Border Ruffian during the Bleeding Kansas confrontations over slavery along the border between Kansas Territory and Missouri.

500|$|Taylor {{developed}} {{what has}} been termed a [...] "love-hate relationship" [...] with Bill Parcells who was the team's defensive coordinator when he was drafted, and would later become their head coach. Parcells often rode players {{in the hopes of}} driving them to better performance. Taylor did not appreciate this approach, and early on told Parcells, [...] "I've had enough. You either cut me or trade me but get the fuck off my back." [...] Parcells kept on Taylor, but privately <b>told</b> <b>some</b> veterans, [...] "I like that LT. That motherfucker's got a mean streak." ...|$|E
500|$|Besides his {{increasing}} {{influence in}} Washington, {{by the late}} 1970s Rangel was New York City's leading black political figure. [...] After initially endorsing Percy Sutton in the 1977 mayoral election, he subsequently endorsed Ed Koch over Mario Cuomo in the Democratic primary run-off. [...] He then attempted to mediate between Mayor Koch and some minority groups who thought the Koch administration racially insensitive.

I thought that was rather nice." ...|$|E

500|$|Branham {{seemed to}} change his {{theological}} positions on the Godhead throughout his ministry. Early in his ministry, Branham at times referred to the Holy Spirit as the third person of the Trinity {{and it was also}} reported that Branham had <b>told</b> <b>some</b> Trinitarians that he agreed with them, but that he felt obligated to the [...] "Jesus Only" [...] Pentecostals because they had supported him early in the revival. However, by the 1960s Branham was openly teaching the oneness position, which holds that there is one God who manifests himself in multiple ways, as opposed to the trinitarian view that the Godhead is made up of three distinctly different persons.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Morse {{received}} a phone call from David Shore, having previously worked with him on the Hack series, who asked him if he would be interested in having a guest role on House. When Morse watched the show, he could not understand why people watched the show, because he believed that [...] "this House guy is a total jerk". When he <b>told</b> <b>some</b> of his friends about the offer, however, their excited reactions convinced him to accept the role. Morse portrayed Michael Tritter, a detective with a vendetta against Gregory House. He earned his first Emmy Award nomination for his work on the series.|$|E
500|$|Desha {{resumed his}} service in Congress at its next term. [...] He was {{disappointed}} at {{the decision not}} to pursue the annexation of Upper Canada and to ignore British impressment of American mariners in favor of pursuing peace with the British. Ultimately, he was dissatisfied with the Treaty of Ghent that ended the war. When William Henry Harrison was being considered by Congress for the position of [...] general-in-chief in late 1813 and early 1814, Desha opposed giving him the title because he claimed that Harrison had determined not to pursue British General Henry Procter following the Battle of the Thames and had only done so after strenuous urging by Isaac Shelby. Desha's charge was a contributing factor in Congress's decision to remove Harrison's name from a resolution of thanks for service in the Northwest Army and withhold from him a Congressional Gold Medal. Both Harrison and Shelby denied Desha's account, and as the issue began to damage Desha's reelection chances, he partially recanted his story. He claimed that he had only <b>told</b> <b>some</b> friends that Harrison was wary of pursuit during a council of war held at Sandwich, Ontario, after the battle, but that he had not personally witnessed a disagreement over the pursuit between Harrison and Shelby.|$|E

In the text, a cruel French Canadian brutalizes his dog, and the dog retaliates and kills the man. London <b>told</b> <b>some</b> of his critics that man's actions are {{the main cause of}} the behavior of their animals, and he would show this in another story, The Call of the Wild.|$|E
2500|$|... "Offending and insulting, is {{different}} from expressing an opinion that can be analyzed, argued on, and can eventually be accepted or rejected ...

I had <b>told</b> <b>some</b> of our elders before, that the religion of the today's world is 'liberalism' and we have no right to make insults about it.
