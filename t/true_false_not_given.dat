It is either <b>true</b> or <b>false,</b> and <b>not</b> both, even in a borderline case. That highly controversial claim is central to the epistemic theory of vagueness, which holds that borderline cases are distinguished by a special kind of obstacle to knowing the truth-value of the statement. But this paper is not a defence of the epistemic theory. If bivalence holds, it presumably doe...|$|R

California State University, Los Angeles, 2012 Committee members: Mark Balaguer, David Pitt, Richard Dean, Kayley VernalisBivalence, Error, Normativity, Practical reasonIn {{this thesis}} I argue for two main conclusions. First, I {{argue that the}} {{principle}} of Bivalence, which claims that every sentence is either <b>true</b> or <b>false,</b> is <b>not</b> <b>true.</b> While many critics of Bivalence have rejected it {{for a number of}} reasons (e. g. vagueness), I argue that Bivalence itself is neither <b>true</b> nor <b>false.</b> Second, I argue that a widely held thesis in philosophical discussions of normativity, the Incorrectness Constraint, is false. However, a closely related thesis, the Non-Correctness Constraint, is true. I show that Christine Korsgaard's much discussed argument against Neo-Humean Instrumentalism relies on the Incorrectness Constraint and cannot be successfully reconstructed using the Non-Correctness Constraint. Since this argument depends on a false premise (i. e. the Incorrectness Constraint), I argue that her argument fails...|$|R

If statements about game rules can be <b>true</b> or <b>false,</b> why <b>not</b> ethical statements? One answer is that we may want ethical statements to be categorically true, while we only need statements about right action to be contingent on the acceptance of the rules of a particular game—that is, the choice to play the game according to a given set of rules.|$|R

40|$|Our system enhances a {{consistent}} OWL ontology by adding new concept and property definitions, {{if they are}} found consistent with the existing ontology. New restrictions are allowed to be posed on existing concepts. But, no changes are allowed on existing restrictions. We build a knowledge table from the ontology to be enhanced, to determine the consistency of an input submission. Knowledge table is a two dimensional table, each row of which corresponds to a concept in the ontology. Each column corresponds to a property restriction appearing as property flavor, a combination of property, restriction and value. The cell values in knowledge table could be { 1 },{ 0 } or { 0, 1 } {{depending on whether the}} property flavor is <b>true,</b> <b>false</b> or <b>not</b> applicable for a concept. This table intuitively stores property restrictions applicable to concepts in the ontology. Interactions between property flavors are captured in another data structure called influence tables.

Secondly, regarding the distinction of internalism and externalism, it is epistemically reasonable to favour internalism over externalism because {{not only is it}} impossible to refer to the future externally but the internal approach concerning the accessibility of justification is a preferable way to justify beliefs about the future. Thirdly, considering the structure of knowledge foundationalism is a better choice than coherentism as it is a robust answer to the regress problem.

40|$|International audienceIn {{recent work}} on context-dependency, {{it has been}} argued that certain types of {{sentences}} give rise to a notion of relative truth. In particular, sentences containing predicates of personal taste and moral or aesthetic evaluation as well as epistemic modals are held to express a proposition (relative to a context of use) which is <b>true</b> or <b>false</b> <b>not</b> only relative to a world of evaluation, but other parameters as well, such as standards of taste or knowledge or an agent. I will argue that the sentences that apparently give rise to relative truth should be understood by relating them in a certain way to the first person. More precisely, such sentences express what I will call 'first-person-based genericity', a form of generalization that is based on an essential first-person application of the predicate. The account differs from standard relative truth account in crucial respects: it is not the truth of the proposition expressed that is relative to the first person; the proposition expressed by a sentence with a predicate of taste rather has absolute truth conditions. Instead it is the propositional content itself that requires a first-personal cognitive access whenever it is entertained. This account, I will argue, avoids a range of problems that standard relative truth theories of the sentences in question face and explains a number of further peculiarities that such sentences display...|$|R
