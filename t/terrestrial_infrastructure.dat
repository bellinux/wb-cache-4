5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} cable networks, Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia is {{distributed}} only via microwave and fiber optic relays. Comcast inherited the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>infrastructure</b> that it uses to transmit the network from PRISM {{at the time}} that network shut down. Since CSN Philadelphia did not uplink its signal to any communications satellites, Comcast was able to avoid a regulation outlined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that requires most television channels to be offered to direct broadcast satellite providers; this loophole, known as the [...] "terrestrial exception", was implemented by the FCC in 1992 to encourage investments in local programming by cable providers. As a result of its limited availability, satellite providers DirecTV, Dish Network and the now-defunct PrimeStar experienced a far slower rate of subscriber penetration into the Philadelphia market compared to other American cities. Craig Moffett, a senior analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. L.L.C., estimated the number of potential customers lost due to the loophole at 450,000.|$|E
5000|$|Since its launch, MSG Network had blocked Verizon and AT&T from {{carrying}} MSG HD on any terms through a controversial guideline {{imposed by the}} Federal Communications Commission (known as the [...] "terrestrial exception"), that was implemented to encourage investments in local programming, which stated that television channels that do not transmit via satellite uplink - MSG HD's programming is distributed to cable television providers through a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>infrastructure</b> using only microwave and fiber optic relays - {{have the authority to}} decide which pay television providers (cable, satellite or telco) can have access to its programming. Because the network was once owned by Cablevision (and remains under common control by the Dolan family to this day), MSG fought attempts by the telco providers to carry it despite the significant rights fees it could collect from carriage deals with those services. On September 22, 2011, the FCC ordered MSG to negotiate with both Verizon FiOS and AT&T U-verse for carriage on each system. MSG and Cablevision used every appeal available to keep the HD channels from being carried by both distributors; however on December 14, 2011, a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals denied Cablevision/MSG Holdings' petition for review. Verizon FiOS began carrying MSG HD and MSG+ HD on its New York City area systems the next day, and AT&T U-Verse began carrying the HD feeds on its Connecticut systems later that month.|$|E

30|$|A HAP {{can provide}} the best {{features}} of both terrestrial masts (which {{may be subject to}} planning restrictions and/or related environmental/health constraints) and satellite systems (which are usually highly expensive). This makes HAP a viable competitor/complement to conventional <b>terrestrial</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and satellite systems. In particular, HAPs permit rapid deployment, and highly efficient use of the radio spectrum (largely through intensive frequency reuse). The relatively close range of HAPs compared to satellites means that data rates can be significantly higher for the same size antennas, and imaging and remote sensing are highly effective, offering low cost and high resolution. A variety of hybrid applications may also be envisaged, such as traffic management, navigation, security management, and so on. There are two fundamental types of platform technology capable of stratospheric flight: manned and unmanned aircraft, and unmanned airships. Other platform technologies at lower altitudes, including manned aircraft and tethered aerostats, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) may also play a developmental role towards HAPs and their applications.|$|R

Currently, PPDR operators go towards a portable LTE infrastructure that provides an access network to field operators, backhauled by a wireless mesh network that can route traffic from and towards Internet through a satellite gateway.

We analysed the throughput, the latency, and the scalability over the number of the flows/operators.

40|$|During the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, {{many regions}} were {{occupied}} by small political communities (city-states) whose form of organization could vary widely, from hierarchical to heterarchical systems to purely independent entities. The different developments in similar areas (e. g. state formation or collapse) make their political organization an attractive subject of study. We {{are interested in}} the nature of the interactions between these polities, as they reflect how things worked at that regional scale, although it is a challenging task to study those relations in a quantitative manner. However, inter-settlement <b>terrestrial</b> <b>infrastructure</b> networks constitute a great opportunity to achieve this goal. They both shape and were shaped by the societies who created them, and they are suitable to be studied quantitatively when represented as spatial (i. e. geographic) graphs. Here, we present a methodology based on network analysis and modelling to look into the reasons why terrestrial routes were configured the way they were. We devise three models inspired in simple decision-making hypotheses to investigate which mechanism was more likely to be responsible for the topology of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>infrastructure</b> network. In particular, we apply this methodology to a paradigmatic case-study (the region of southern Etruria during the Iron Age) from which we managed to build empirical networks, by means of archaeological and historical sources. We then compare the topological features of the synthetic networks generated by the models against those in the empirical systems. Our results show that a rather simple model, combining local decisions with global, integrated information of the system, is a good candidate to the task at hand. It reproduces the features of the empirical systems while remaining coherent with the historical knowledge about the Etruscan region...|$|E
40|$|Aerial-Terrestrial {{communication}} networks able {{to provide}} rapidly-deployable and resilient communications capable of offering broadband connectivity are emerging as a suitable solution for public safety scenarios. During natural disasters or unexpected events, <b>terrestrial</b> <b>infrastructure</b> can be seriously damaged or disrupted due to physical destruction of network components, disruption in subsystem interconnections and/or network congestion. In this context, Aerial-Terrestrial communication networks are intended to provide temporal large coverage with the provision of broadband services at the disaster area.

40|$|Voice-based Private Mobile Radio (PMR) {{networks}} are currently the state-of-the-art for coordination of disaster response works. The increasing availability of digital data {{on one hand}} and the advantages of IT-based command and control systems on the other, create a need for data networks between the incident area and back office command and control structures. During major incidents, commercial public networks might be damaged or overloaded, and current digital PMR networks do not support data rates beyond several kbit/s. Satellite communication can play an important role to complement existing terrestrial networks because of their inherent independence from <b>terrestrial</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> wide coverage and multicast capacity. However, in order to devise the best solution, it is important to capture and model user operating modes, communication needs as well as the topological characteristics of user deployment and motion. These findings are synthesised in what is called a “scenario”. This paper describes the current work within the ETSI STF 472 in the SatEC working group on small to large scale emergency scenarios. A general overview of rescue response roles is also described together with communication network requirements and flows.

40|$|Wireless {{communications}} {{are critical}} for public protection and disaster relief (PPDR) professionals during the emergency operations that follow natural or man-made disasters, scenarios in which both commercial and dedicated terrestrial networks often fail to provide the necessary support. The reason is threefold: they simply get destroyed by the disaster, they cannot sustain the sudden surge of network demand or they fail to deliver the necessary bandwidth and/or other QoS guarantees. Because LTE is expected to become the main wireless technology for broadband communication, a lot of studies have been devoted to assess its compliance for PPDR purposes and to find suitable architectural solutions able to meet mission-critical requirements. This approach is surely worthy, but {{it is based on}} the assumption that infrastructure-based terrestrial systems are reliable. As a consequence, in worstcase emergency scenarios appropriate guarantees can be provided only in the hypothesis of huge investment costs. Recent developments in satellite technologies are bringing the availability of non-terrestrial high performance channels, with better properties when comparing to LTE for what regards availability and reliability. On this basis, the paper proposes a network architecture based on the integration of satellite and LTE networks for both infrastructure-based and infrastructure-less scenarios. The proposal aims to provide field operators and people in distress with transparent accessibility, coverage guarantees and broadband performance when <b>terrestrial</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are lacking, and to expand their coverage, capacity and resilience otherwise...|$|R
