5|$|The {{books are}} based on the vampire myth, but Twilight vampires differ in a number of {{particulars}} from the general vampire lore. For instance, Twilight vampires have strong piercing teeth rather than fangs; they glitter in sunlight rather than burn; and they can drink animal as well as human blood. Meyer comments that her vampire mythology differs from that of other authors because she wasn't informed about the canon vampires, saying, It wasn't until I knew that Twilight would be published <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to think about whether my vampires were too much the same or too much different from the others. Of course, I was far too invested in my characters at that point to be making changes... so I didn't cut out fangs and coffins and so forth as a way to distinguish my vampires; that's just how they came to me.|$|E
500|$|In May 1944 the Judenrat is {{told the}} ghettos {{will be closed}} with {{immediate}} effect and the residents deported. Eliezer's family is first moved to the smaller ghetto, {{but they are not}} told their final destination, only that they may each take a few personal belongings. The Hungarian police, wielding truncheons and rifle butts, march Eliezer's neighbours through the streets. [...] "It was from that moment <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to hate them, and my hate is still the only link between us today." ...|$|E

He {{was one of the}} most {{significant}} architects of the 20th century, combining traditional Japanese styles with modernism, and designed major buildings on five continents. Tange was also an influential patron of the Metabolist movement. He said: [...] "It was, I believe, around 1959 or at the beginning of the sixties <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to think about what I was later to call structuralism", (cited in Plan 2/1982, Amsterdam), a reference to the architectural movement known as Dutch Structuralism.|$|E

500|$|Like Antichrist Superstar before it, Holy Wood uses a song cycle structure, {{dividing}} the album into four movements. These movements are titled A: In the Shadow, D: The Androgyne, A: Of Red Earth, and M: The Fallen. Manson described the record as [...] "the final {{piece of a}} triptych <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> with Antichrist Superstar." [...] Despite being {{the last of the}} three albums to be released, Manson explained that the triptych's storyline takes place in reverse chronological order; Holy Wood began the story, and Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar were sequels. The storyline unfolds in a multi-tiered series of metaphors and allusions; for example, the album's title refers not only to the Hollywood Sign, but also to [...] "the tree of knowledge that Adam took the first fruit from when he fell out of paradise, the wood that Christ was crucified on, the wood that [...] Oswald's rifle is made from, and the wood that so many coffins are made of." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} he wrote Connotations, Copland {{had come to the}} view that serial {{composition}} was [...] "like looking at a picture from a different point of view" [...] and used it [...] "with the hope that it would freshen and enrich my [...] technique." [...] Part of that changed viewpoint, Copland said, [...] "was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to hear chords that I wouldn't have heard otherwise. Heretofore, I had been thinking tonally, but this was a new way of moving tones about." [...] Serialism also allowed Copland a synthesis of serial and non-serial practices that had long concerned Copland and he had previously felt impossible to attain. One challenge Copland said he faced while he composed Connotations was [...] "to construct an overall line that had continuity, dramatic force and an inherent unity." [...] He stated that he had faced a similar challenge in his Orchestral Variations (his orchestration of the Piano Variations). He added that while dodecaphonic techniques supplied [...] "the building blocks" [...] for Connotations, it was up to him to supply [...] "the edifice" [...] that these blocks would eventually form.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1941, {{during the}} German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, HKP 562 was deployed to Vilnius (Vilna), Lithuania.

2500|$|Anderson {{moved to}} Los Angeles in 1992, {{and spent a}} year auditioning. The same year, she {{appeared}} in her first feature-length film The Turning, starring Karen Allen and Tess Harper – the film drama is an adaptation of the play Home Fires Burning. Although she had once vowed she would never do television, being {{out of work for}} a year changed her mind. Anderson recalled: [...] "First of all, I swore I'd never move to Los Angeles, and once I did, I swore I'd never do television. It was only after being out of work for almost a year <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> going in [...] on some stuff that I would pray that I wouldn't get because I didn't {{want to be involved in}} it." [...] She broke into mainstream television in 1993, with a guest appearance on the collegiate drama, Class of '96, on the fledgling Fox Network.|$|E
2500|$|Huston took producing, writing, and {{directing}} credits {{for his next}} two films: Moulin Rouge (1952); and Beat the Devil (1953). [...] Moby Dick (1956), however, was written by Ray Bradbury, although Huston had his name added to the screenplay credit {{after the completion of}} the project. [...] Although Huston had personally hired Bradbury to adapt Herman Melville's novel into a screenplay, Bradbury and Huston did not get along during pre-production, and Bradbury later dramatized their relationship in the short story [...] "Banshee"; Peter O'Toole would later play the role based on John Huston when [...] "Banshee" [...] was adapted into an episode of The Ray Bradbury Theater. Bradbury wrote more poems, essays, and stories on his time in Ireland, but was reluctant to write a book because {{he did not want to}} gossip about Huston. It was not until after he read Katharine Hepburn’s memoir The Making of the African Queen: Or How I went to Africa with Bogart, Bacall, and Huston and almost lost my mind that he decided that he could write “a book which is fair, which presents the Huston that I loved along with the one <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to fear on occasion.” He published Green Shadows, White Whale, a novelization of his time in Ireland with Huston, almost 40 years after he wrote the screenplay for Moby Dick.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the 20th of last month, in the choir, after I had celebrated Mass I yielded to a {{drowsiness}} similar to a sweet sleep. [...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation....the pain was so intense <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to feel as if I were dying on the cross.|$|E
