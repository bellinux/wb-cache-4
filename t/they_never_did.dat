25|$|Attempting {{to replace}} Morales' bat, {{at least for}} the short term, the Angels nearly had a trade in place for Chicago Cubs first baseman Derrek Lee; however, even though the two parties agreed on the terms of the deal and were ready to pull the trigger, Lee invoked his no-trade clause, and the deal was nixed. This move on Lee's part proved fatal for the Angels, as <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> find the right bat to replace Morales, ending the season with a record of 80–82, in third place and ten games behind the {{division}} champion (and eventually American League champion) Texas Rangers.|$|E
25|$|In May 1735, Vicente died, {{filling the}} former {{privateer}} with guilt. Attempting {{to escape the}} administration of Abadía, Enríquez took refuge in the Convent of Santo Tomás on October 30, 1735. He remained there after hearing rumors {{that he was going}} to be jailed at El Morro. However, even there the governor pursued him. Abadía requested permission to obtain a search warrant and check if Enríquez had taken any wealth there. All of the rooms were rummaged, but nothing of worth was found. Despite this, Abadía confiscated Enríquez's correspondence. Incredulous, the former privateer requested a certification for the search warrant. Between 1735 and 1737, Enríquez wrote to Phillip V six times requesting an independent prosecutor that could launch a neutral investigation. He also offered to reorganize the now scattered privateers. However, the king never replied directly and the only response, issued by the Council of the Indies, informed him that they did not consider that action convenient. From that moment onwards, Enríquez only wrote to detail his misery and to request the payment of an old debt. During the following years, his only contact to the outside world was through the Dominican friars. To Enríquez's chagrin, Abadía had unusual longevity in the office of governor, with the Crown granting him time beyond the stipulated five years. In 1740, the Council of the Indies revised Mendizábal's case and issued a declaration restoring his honor and rank. However, <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> the same for Enríquez despite being charged as a supposed accomplice of the former governor. Most of his friend eventually left, only Paris and the members of the Church remained besides him. On June 29, 1743, Abadía died while still in office. Five months afterwards, Enríquez died a sudden death. After receiving the Extreme Unction, his body was laid to rest in a mass grave as a charity, since he was penniless and nobody paid for a burial. Only Paris and Rosa Enríquez, his unrecognized daughter who would later claim that he had been poisoned, mourned his death.|$|E

500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. <b>They</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother. Follow the Leader marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like [...] "Justin" [...] and [...] "Pretty" [...] written about incidents occurring during adulthood.|$|E
500|$|A {{particularly}} well-received work by Gibson was Agrippa (a {{book of the}} dead) (1992), a 300-line semi-autobiographical electronic {{poem that}} was his contribution to a collaborative project with artist Dennis Ashbaugh and publisher Kevin Begos, Jr. Gibson's text focused on the ethereal nature of memories (the title refers to a photo album) and was originally published on a 3.5" [...] floppy disk embedded {{in the back of}} an artist's book containing etchings by Ashbaugh (intended to fade from view once the book was opened and exposed to light — <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>did,</b> however). Gibson commented that Ashbaugh's design [...] "eventually included a supposedly self-devouring floppy-disk intended to display the text only once, then eat itself." [...] Contrary to numerous colorful reports, the diskettes were never actually [...] "hacked"; instead the poem was manually transcribed from a surreptitious videotape of a public showing in Manhattan in December 1992, and released on the MindVox bulletin board the next day; this is the text that circulated widely on the Internet.|$|E

Hi-5 continued to film one television series and record one music album each year, with their releases consistently receiving album accreditations; Celebrate was certified as gold, while Jump and Jive with Hi-5, Boom Boom Beat and It's a Hi-5 Christmas went platinum, and It's a Party received double platinum status. Four of their albums reached the top10 on the ARIA Albums Chart, It's a Party (No.4, July 2000), Boom Boom Beat (No.3, August 2001), It's a Hi-5 Christmas (No.4, December 2001) and Hi-5 Hits (No.10, July 2003). Hi-5 also toured nationally every year, with sell-out concerts in venues {{such as the}} Sydney Opera House. The quintet's production of Hi-5 Alive won the 2002 Helpmann Award for [...] "Best Children's Stage Show". In 2001 and occasions earlier, the cast stated that <b>they</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> not expect that Hi-5 would become so successful.
