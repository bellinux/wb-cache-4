An immortalized cell line will reproduce indefinitely under specific conditions, and the HeLa cell line continues to be a source of invaluable medical data to the present day.

5|$|In 2002, Mya Breitbart, Forest Rohwer, {{and colleagues}} used {{environmental}} shotgun sequencing (see below) {{to show that}} 200 liters of seawater contains over 5000 different viruses. Subsequent studies showed {{that there are more}} than a thousand viral species in human stool and possibly a million different viruses per kilogram of marine sediment, including many bacteriophages. Essentially all of the viruses in these studies were new species. In 2004, Gene Tyson, Jill Banfield, and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley and the Joint Genome Institute sequenced DNA extracted from an acid mine drainage system. This effort resulted in the complete, or nearly complete, genomes for a handful of bacteria and archaea that had previously resisted attempts <b>to</b> <b>culture</b> them.|$|E

40|$|A colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) {{has been}} {{partially}} purified and concentrated from mouse yolk sac-conditioned medium (YSCM). M-CSF appeared to preferentially stimulate CBA bone marrow granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (GM-CFC) to differentiate to form macrophage colonies in semisolid agar cultures. By comparison, colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) from mouse lungconditioned medium (MLCM) stimulated {{the formation of}} granulocytic, mixed granulocytic-macrophage, and pure macrophage colonies. Mixing experiments indicated that both M-CSF and GM-CSF stimulated all of the GM-CFC but that the smaller CFC were more sensitive to GM-CSF and that the larger CFC were more sensitive to M-CSF. Almost all developing "clones " stimulated initially with M-CSF continued to develop when transferred <b>to</b> <b>cultures</b> containing GM-CSF. In the converse situation, only 50 % of GM-CSF prestimulated "clones " survived when transferred <b>to</b> <b>cultures</b> containing M-CSF.

5|$|Some {{species of}} mysids are easy <b>to</b> <b>culture</b> {{on a large}} scale in the {{laboratory}} as they are highly adaptive, and can tolerate a wide range of conditions. Despite low fecundity, these species have a short reproductive cycle which means they can quickly reproduce in vast numbers. They can be cultured in static or flow-through systems, the latter having been shown to be able to maintain a higher stocking density than a static system. In flow-through systems, juvenile mysids are continuously separated from the adult brood stock in order to reduce mortality due to cannibalism. Artemia (brine shrimp) juveniles (incubated for 24 hours) are the most common food in mysid cultures, sometimes enriched with highly unsaturated fatty acids to increase their nutritional value.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Aureoboletus mirabilis grow solitarily, scattered, or {{sometimes}} {{in small groups}} {{on the ground or}} on well-decayed conifer logs, especially of western and mountain hemlock, but occasionally also Douglas-fir and western red cedar. The fungus is strongly suspected to form mycorrhizal associations with hemlock, although standard attempts at growing B.mirabilis mycorrhizae in laboratory culture have failed. Although fruit bodies are sometimes found growing on logs with advanced brown cubical rot—a trait suggestive of cellulose-decomposing saprobic fungi—the rotten wood harboring the fungi typically contains abundant conifer roots. It has been suggested that B.mirabilis has specifically adapted to this niche to reduce competition for nutrients with other mycorrhizal fungi, and further, that the inability <b>to</b> <b>culture</b> mycorrhizae in the lab using standard techniques may be because certain physical or chemical characteristics of the wood with brown cubical rot are required for fungal growth.|$|E
5|$|While Manhattan {{is being}} evacuated, a Japanese man named Kunihiko Maeda manages {{to sneak into}} the city, {{witnessing}} a police officer combust into flames in the process. Aya awakens in an apartment in SoHo, with Daniel and Maeda at her side. Maeda reveals the origins of Eve: A scientist tried <b>to</b> <b>culture</b> the cells of his wife after {{she was involved in}} a car accident, and the mitochondria in her cells took over her body. Maeda believes that Eve may be trying to give birth to an “Ultimate Being”. The next day, the three go to see Dr. Klamp again. After examining cell samples from that of Eve and Aya's, Maeda concludes that based on selfish gene theory, Aya and Eve's mitochondria are in an evolutionary race for survival. Dr. Klamp suddenly appears and asks a few questions of Aya in a hostile manner. The three leave and head for the St. Francis Hospital, where Maeda thinks Eve may try to get sperm for the Ultimate Being. When they arrive, they find that Eve is already there. Eve takes the sperm and escapes.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the amino acid analog FPA on vaccinia virus {{replication}} in HeLa cells was investigated. By varying the dose of FPA or the time after infection at which the analog was added <b>to</b> <b>cultures,</b> {{it was possible to}} inhibit differentially the synthesis of viral components in vaccinia-infected cells. When sufficient FPA was added <b>to</b> <b>cultures</b> at the time of infection, the synthesis of viral DNA, NP antigen, infectious virus, and HA was inhibited. The inhibition of synthesis of LS antigen under all conditions studied was only partial. FPA added <b>to</b> <b>cultures</b> at 6 or more hours post-infection did not inhibit production of viral antigens or infectious virus. The inhibition was reversed by PA added with the FPA, but PA added at later times was progressively less effective in restoring the ability of inhibited infected <b>cultures</b> <b>to</b> produce virus. The proportion of nuclei incorporating thymidine-H 3 was decreased in cultures infected with vaccinia virus. This decrease was not seen in cultures receiving FPA at the time of infection...|$|R
