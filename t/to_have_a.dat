5|$|ACAs {{have three}} ports: the OTG port for the {{portable}} device, which is required <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Micro-A plug on a captive cable; the accessory port, which is required <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Micro-AB or type-A receptacle; and the charging port, which is required <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Micro-B receptacle, or type-A plug or charger on a captive cable. The ID pin of the OTG port is not connected within plug as usual, {{but to the}} ACA itself, where signals outside the OTG floating and ground states are used for ACA detection and state signaling. The charging port does not pass data, but does use the D± signals for charging port detection. The accessory port acts as any other port. When appropriately signaled by the ACA, the portable device can charge from the bus power {{as if there were}} a charging port present; any OTG signals over bus power are instead passed to the portable device via the ID signal. Bus power is also provided to the accessory port from the charging port transparently.|$|E

30|$|Items {{related to}} sexual activities, such as “decreased sexual interest,” “unable <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> orgasm or climax,” and “took too long <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> orgasm or climax,” were {{evaluated}} as “difficult to answer” {{by more than}} 40 % of patients. Moreover, “unable <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> orgasm or climax” was remarked on only once, and “took too long <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> orgasm or climax” was not remarked on at all, even though {{a high proportion of}} patients evaluated them as “difficult to answer.” This may have been because Japanese patients tend to be hesitant about answering questions regarding sexual activities [22]. The lack of remarks on these items could also have been influenced by gender non-concordance between study participants and interviewers.|$|R

50|$|The bordered patch is an {{extremely}} variable butterfly. The upperside of the wings is mainly black with the forewing having rows of white and/or yellow-orange spots of varying sizes. There is usually one whitish spot in the forewing cell. The hindwing has many color variations. Those variations can be: almost completely black <b>to</b> <b>having</b> some red postmedian spots <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> few rows of white postmedian spots <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>an</b> all red-orange discal area <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> yellow-orange postmedian band of varying width. The underside of the wings is just as variable as the upperside. It varies from <b>having</b> <b>a</b> few rows of white and red spots <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> yellow-white hindwing median band of varying width to the underside being mostly golden yellow with large yellow-orange spots and a thick golden-yellow median band. All of these variations <b>have</b> <b>a</b> red spot near the hindwing tornus. Its wingspan ranges from 1+1/4 to 1+7/8 in.|$|R

5|$|Cinematographer Roger Deakins {{discussed}} {{the look of}} the film with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they wanted some parts of the film <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very stylized look. Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.|$|E

5|$|During {{symptomatic}} attacks, {{administration of}} {{high doses of}} intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, with oral corticosteroids seeming <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> similar efficacy and safety profile.
