40|$|A {{magnetic}} field connecting a Kerr black hole to a disk rotating around it can extract energy and angular momentum {{from the black}} hole and transfer them to <b>the</b> <b>disk</b> if <b>the</b> black hole rotates faster than <b>the</b> <b>disk.</b> <b>The</b> energy can be dissipated and radiated away by <b>the</b> <b>disk,</b> which makes <b>the</b> <b>disk</b> shine without <b>the</b> need of accretion.

Near the midplane, charged grains are unable to drift through the neutral gas and there is negligible coupling between the magnetic field and <b>the</b> <b>disk</b> material.
