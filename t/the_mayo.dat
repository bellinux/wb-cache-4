5|$|Under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), {{students}} and their educational employers are exempted from paying Social Security taxes. The Treasury Department issued a regulation in 2004, declaring those who worked more than 40 hours a week were ineligible for such an exemption. <b>The</b> <b>Mayo</b> Foundation filed suit to challenge the regulation and for a refund of the taxes it had paid on its medical residents—recently graduated physicians who work more than full-time providing patient care, but who are still considered trainees by the medical profession. The District Court ruled for <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> Foundation and struck the regulation, but was reversed by the Court of Appeals.|$|E

5|$|After several {{case reports}} in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{periodic}} paralysis was first described in full by the German neurologist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890) in 1885. In 1926 the Japanese physician Tetsushiro Shinosaki, from Fukuoka, observed {{the high rate of}} thyroid disease in Japanese people with periodic paralysis. The first English-language report, in 1931, originated from Dunlap and Kepler, physicians at <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> Clinic; they described the condition in a patient with features of Graves' disease. In 1937 periodic paralysis was linked with hypokalemia, as well as precipitation of attacks with glucose and insulin. This phenomenon {{has been used as a}} diagnostic test.|$|E

In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity. Studies in the 1980s confirmed the autoimmune nature, and research in the 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aims: A {{retrospective}} study of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) {{was performed to}} study <b>the</b> Original <b>Mayo</b> Model for predicting survival by a Dutch data-set of patients, presentation of disease progression; assessment of liver transplantation, prediction of post-transplantation survival; {{and the addition of}} two laboratory variables to <b>the</b> Original <b>Mayo</b> Model. Materials and Methods: Survival of 83 patients, 37 of whom underwent transplantation, were studied. Mean follow-up was 6. 0 +/- 0. 45 SEM years. Risk score at diagnosis, platelet count, and serum sodium were analyzed in a Cox model. Results: <b>The</b> Original <b>Mayo</b> Model estimated survival for low-, medium-, and high-risk groups accurately and it also presented disease progression. Baseline Mayo risk score in a Cox model had a regression coefficient of 1. 01, indicating an excellent predictor p < 0. 0001. Platelet count was a predictor of survival (p < 0. 002), whereas serum sodium did not (p = 0. 67). A new model combined of <b>the</b> Original <b>Mayo</b> risk score and platelet count predicted survival in high-risk patients somewhat better compared to <b>the</b> Original <b>Mayo</b> Model. With both models, liver transplantation had a significant beneficial effect on, survival (p < 0. 001). The scores revealed no significant influence (p = 0. 47) for overall post-transplantation survival. Conclusions: <b>The</b> Original <b>Mayo</b> Model remains <b>the</b> model of choice for patients with PBC for prognostication from 3 - 8 years, is a useful tool in the assessment of liver transplantation but not an indicator of post-transplantation survival. Platelet count showed to have additional prognostic value. A new model combined of platelet count and <b>the</b> Original <b>Mayo</b> risk score did predict survival in high-risk groups slightly better compared to <b>the</b> Original <b>Mayo</b> Model...|$|R

Hunt has a one-night stand with a patient's friend, leaving Yang heartbroken. She decides to move on, unsure of her future with him. As the end of the fifth year of residency is near, the surgical residents, including Yang, prepare for their medical boards and for the different fellowships they plan on joining. After she passes her exams, Yang reconciles with Hunt and tells him she is leaving Seattle for <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> Clinic, Minnesota. Afterward, Yang, Meredith, Shepherd, Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), and Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) are involved in an aviation accident while on the way to Boise, Idaho to perform surgery on conjoined twins. Lexie dies, and Mark later succumbs to his injuries after they are rescued and dies. Following their rescue, Yang, traumatized, suffers from brief reactive psychosis which provokes violent outbursts and makes her unresponsive. Yang leaves Seattle to become a cardiothoracic surgical fellow and goes, as planned, to <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> Clinic, but has difficulties adapting to her new colleagues' way of working. While in Minnesota, Yang develops a friendship with a near-retirement cardio surgeon, Craig Thomas (William Daniels). She mainly teases him with comments regarding his old age. She also begins an affair with the head of surgery Dr. Parker (Steven Culp) who has issues with Thomas. After Thomas dies from a heart attack, Yang returns to Seattle.|$|E
