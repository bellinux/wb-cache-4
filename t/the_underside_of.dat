5|$|Only the {{serrated}} {{and often}} keratinized {{tip of the}} sublingua is free to move small distances along <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the tongue, {{while the majority of}} its length adheres to <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the tongue. These free-moving folds or filaments are called the plica fimbriata and attach {{to the base of the}} sublingua and are supported at the midline by the plica mediana. The plica fimbriata is highly developed and specialized in lemurs, and makes up the majority of the sublingua.|$|E

5|$|The abdomen is {{long and}} slender and {{consists}} of 10 segments and a terminal appendage-bearing segment. The second and third segments are enlarged, and in males, a cleft on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the second segment contains a pair of claspers and the penis. The spermaries open on the 9th segment. In females, the genital opening is on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the eighth segment and is covered by a simple flap or an ovipositor, depending on species and the method of egg-laying.|$|E
5|$|The adult California condor is {{a uniform}} black with the {{exception}} of large triangular patches or bands of white on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the wings. It has gray legs and feet, an ivory-colored bill, a frill of black feathers surrounding the base of the neck, and brownish red eyes.

5|$|This {{response}} {{lowers the}} surface area available to herbivores, which are presented with <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> each leaflet, and results in a wilted appearance. It may also physically dislodge small herbivores, such as insects.|$|E
5|$|Ventral grooves {{run from}} the lower jaw to the umbilicus, about halfway along <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the body. These grooves are less {{numerous}} (usually 14–22) than in other rorquals, but are fairly wide.|$|E
5|$|Like other boletes, Boletus pinophilus has small pores on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> its cap {{rather than}} gills. These are {{coloured}} white at first, becoming yellow {{with age and}} olivaceous-brown at full maturity. The spores are cylindric-ellipsoid, smooth, with oil drops and dimensions 15.520 by 4.55.5µm. They produce an olive-brown spore print.|$|E

5|$|No fossil {{evidence}} of Dimetrodons skin {{has yet been}} found. Impressions of {{the skin of a}} related animal, Estemmenosuchus, indicate {{that it would have been}} smooth and well-provided with glands. Dimetrodon also may have had large scutes on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> its tail and belly, as other synapsids did.|$|E
5|$|On fertile fronds, from 1 to 15 {{elliptical}} or narrow sori can {{be found}} on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> each pinna. They are 0.5 to 1.5millimeters long, covered by translucent, pale tan indusia with somewhat jagged edges. Each sporangium holds 64 spores. The species has a chromosome number of 2n = 72 in the sporophyte; it is a diploid.|$|E
5|$|Scales in {{the central}} or throat region, which are {{in contact with the}} first ventral scales of a snake's body and are flanked by the chin shields, are called gular scales. The mental groove is a {{longitudinal}} groove on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the head between the large, paired chin shields and continuing between the smaller gular scales.|$|E

5|$|The M249 is a belt-fed {{light machine}} gun. It fires the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge, usually a {{combination}} of one M856 tracer and four M855 ball cartridges fed from M27 linked belts. Belts are typically held in a hard plastic or soft canvas box attached to <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the weapon.|$|E
5|$|The hindwing is {{frequently}} caudate, i.e. the veins {{near the end}} of the tornus have one or more tails. The tornus itself being often produced and frequently lobed. Along the hindwing termen there are tightly-packed scales in a double row. <b>The</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the scales project and form a regular narrow fringe referred to as cilia.|$|E
5|$|Ziphiids {{consist of}} 22 species of beaked whale. These vary from size, to coloration, to distribution, {{but they all}} share a similar hunting style. They use a suction technique, aided {{by a pair of}} grooves on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> their head, not unlike the throat pleats on the rorquals, to feed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>undersides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{wings are}} pale blue without an obvious pattern, {{except for a}} pale white band.|$|R

5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, {{and may be}} among the most primitive living neopteran insects. They have a relatively small head and a broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the head and include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.|$|E
5|$|Down {{the middle}} of the sublingua is a thick {{strengthening}} rod called the plica mediana or lytta, which connects the sublingua to <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the tongue, and is part of the lingual septum (septum of the tongue). The thickness and size of the plica mediana can vary between species, and except in treeshrews, it is cartilaginous and provides support for the sublingua.|$|E
5|$|Mantas {{evolved from}} bottom-dwelling stingrays, {{eventually}} developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris {{still has a}} vestigial remnant of a sting barb {{in the form of}} a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays lie on <b>the</b> <b>underside</b> <b>of</b> the head, while in mantas they are right at the front. Manta rays and devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders.|$|E
