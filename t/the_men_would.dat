5|$|Black women {{played a}} minor role in units {{such as the}} Rhodesia Native Regiment, {{accompanying}} the black soldiers into the operational area and performing domestic tasks like washing and cooking. Many of these were local East African women who had formed attachments with RNR soldiers. Officers tolerated {{the presence of these}} women in the interest of morale, aware that attempting to take them away from <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>would</b> probably lead to mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Auchinleck, now Commander-in-Chief, India, {{strongly}} opposed {{such a move}} preferring to retain the division as an entity. Instead, he proposed that the newly arrived 81st (West Africa) Division {{could be used in}} its place. Despite his arguments {{and the end of the}} division's availability for operations against the Japanese-occupied Ramree Island, he was over-ruled by Churchill's backing of Wingate. On 6September, the division began reorganising for long-range penetration. It had been estimated that 10 percent of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>would</b> be unsuitable but this had been based on an erroneous report given in London (believed to be from Wingate) that the division was not first class, even though the standard of its infantry was high.|$|E
5|$|The French and American armies {{marched through}} Philadelphia from September 2 to the 4th, where the American {{soldiers}} announced {{they would not}} leave Maryland until they received one month's pay in coin, {{rather than in the}} worthless Continental paper currency. General Rochambeau generously loaned Washington half of his supply of gold Spanish coins. This would be the last time <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>would</b> be paid. It significantly strengthened French and American relations On September 5, Washington learned of the arrival of de Grasse's fleet off the Virginia Capes. De Grasse debarked his French troops to join Lafayette, and then sent his empty transports to pick up the American troops. Washington made a visit to his home, Mount Vernon, on his way to Yorktown.|$|E

Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>would</b> link up again – {{with the help of}} peasant sympathizers – and would form the core leadership of the guerrilla army. A number of female revolutionaries, including Celia Sanchez and Haydée Santamaría (the sister of Abel Santamaria), also assisted Fidel Castro's operations in the mountains.|$|E

25|$|Careful training: When {{his troops}} {{were not on}} {{military}} campaigns to win back lost Chinese territory in the north, Yue put his men through intense training. Apart from troop movement and weapons drills, this training also involved them leaping over walls and crawling through moats in full battle garb. The intensity of the training was such that <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>would</b> not even try to visit their families if they passed by their homes while on movement and even trained on their days off.|$|E
25|$|After a {{few months}} in port, the men petitioned their captain for the pay they should have {{received}} since their employment began. If this request had been granted, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>would</b> no longer have been tied to the ship and could easily have left, so predictably their petition was denied. After a similar petition to James Houblon by the men's wives had also failed, many of the sailors became desperate, believing that they had been sold into slavery to the Spanish.|$|E
25|$|Although {{almost none}} saw combat, they {{replaced}} men in noncombat positions {{and got the}} same pay as <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>would</b> have on the same job. At the same time over 16 million men left their jobs to join the war in Europe and elsewhere, opening even more opportunities and places for women to take over in the job force. Although two million women lost their jobs after the war ended, female participation in the workforce was still higher than it had ever been.|$|E

The women would collect edible roots and berries but they would also {{preserve}} the food and build tools for everyday life. The band worked together so everyone would have enough food. If there were shortages on food the band would split into smaller bands so they had {{a better chance to}} survive.|$|E
25|$|Head hunting, a male activity, {{would involve}} {{separating}} men from their women before, {{during and after}} coming back from an expedition. The women, as a cultural practice, would encourage men to undertake head-hunting as a prerequisite to marriage. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>would</b> go on an expedition against other tribes or neighbouring kingdoms, and kill to score number of heads {{they were able to}} hunt. A successful head hunter would be conferred a right to ornaments. The practice of head hunting was banned in 19th century India, and is no longer practised among Naga people.|$|E
25|$|A central {{act in the}} Wiyot people's {{spirituality is}} an annual World Renewal Ceremony held at Tuluwat village. Indian Island, {{formerly}} called Duluwat Island, was and {{is the center of}} Wiyot world. On the island a ceremonial dance was held to start the new year. The ceremony was called the World Renewal ceremony. All people were welcomed, no one was turned away. The ceremony lasted seven to ten days. It was held at the village site of Tutulwat on {{the northern part of the}} island. Traditionally <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>would</b> leave the island and return the next day with the day's supplies. The elders, women and children were left to rest on the island along with a few men.|$|E

25|$|Joshua {{told his}} {{officers}} {{to have the}} Israelites prepare food, for within three days they were to cross the Jordan to possess the land that God was giving them. Joshua told the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh to remember their commitment to Moses, whereby God would give them their land {{on the east side}} of the Jordan and their wives, children, and cattle would stay there, but <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>would</b> fight at the forefront of the Israelites until God gave the Israelites the land of Israel. They answered Joshua that they would follow his commands just as they had followed Moses. Whoever rebelled against Joshua's command would be put to death.|$|E
25|$|Up to 25% of {{military}} burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows. Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya {{points out that}} when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women {{would have to be}} able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-hegemony in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>would</b> have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.|$|E
25|$|A {{court in}} El Paso held an inquest into the deaths, with Constable Krempkau, who was fluent in Spanish, acting as an interpreter. The verdict was that Sanchez and Juarique {{had been in}} the {{vicinity}} of Hale's ranch looking for the stolen cattle. The court determined that the American cattle rustlers, among them Hale, had feared that <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>would</b> discover the cattle and return with a larger and armed Mexican force. Two American cattle rustlers, Pervey and Fredericks, were accused of the murders of Sanchez and Juarique after they were overheard bragging about killing two cowboys when they found them trailing the herd to Hale's ranch during the night of April 13 or in the early morning of the 14th.|$|E

25|$|Svenskhuset (the Swedish House) is {{the oldest}} house on Spitsbergen. The house was erected by the Swedes on Cape Thordsen in Isfjorden, and was {{intended}} to withstand the harsh conditions of the Svalbard winters. A group of Norwegian seal hunters were stuck on the island {{in the autumn of}} 1872. They sought out the Finland-Swedish explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, who at the time was conducting an expedition in the area, for assistance. Nordenskiöld did not have the resources to accommodate all the hunters, so it was agreed that a number of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>would</b> make their way to Svenskhuset, where they knew there would be food, coal and equipment. Seventeen men without families were selected, and on 14 October 1872 they set out for Svenskhuset in row boats. The journey was 350 km (220 mi), and it took the crew seven days to get to their destination.|$|E
25|$|At {{four o'clock}} that {{afternoon}} {{flag of truce}} was displayed and a senior French officer was despatched in a schooner to offer terms. By 5 Maurice had agreed to surrender Diamond Rock, the officers were to retain their swords and <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>would</b> remain under their orders. They were {{to be taken to}} Fort-de-France, and from there repatriated to a British settlement at the first opportunity, under parole. With these terms agreed, the British surrendered Diamond Rock. The British had two men killed and one man wounded in the battle. French casualties were harder to judge, Maurice estimated they amounted to seventy, the French commander of the landing force made a 'hasty calculation' of fifty. In addition to this the British had sunk five large boats, and potentially inflicted further casualties during the bombardment of the French warships. Maurice and his men were taken off the rock on the morning of 6 June and put on board the Pluton and Berwick.|$|E
25|$|The {{battalion}} {{had just}} arrived in camp at Eastbourne for annual training on Sunday 2 August 1914 when news reached them of the mobilisation of the Continental Powers. The battalion immediately entrained for London and the men returned to their homes. Mobilisation came on 5 August. The men were accommodated in Curtain Road and Scrutton Street schools, the transport in Broad Street Goods Yard, and the officers at the Armfields Hotel. A week later, the Commanding Officer, Viscount Hood, asked if <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>would</b> volunteer for foreign service, and practically the whole battalion did so, making it eligible to be sent overseas. The men who did not so volunteer, or were unfit, were constituted as a second battalion to which the new recruits were directed. This was named the 2/7th Londons, the service battalion becoming the 1/7th Londons {{under the command of}} Col Edward Faux, a long-serving officer of the regiment. In April 1915 a reserve battalion, named 3/7th Londons, was organised to train and supply drafts to the other battalions serving overseas.|$|E
