5|$|The Second Boer War had {{alerted the}} army <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> posed by fire zones that {{were covered by}} long-range, magazine-fed rifles. In the place of volley firing and frontal attacks, there was a greater {{emphasis}} on advancing in extended order, the use of available cover, the use of artillery to support the attack, flank and converging attacks and fire and movement. The Army expected units to advance as far as possible in a firing line without opening fire, both to conceal their positions and conserve ammunition, then to attack in successive waves, closing with the enemy decisively.|$|E
5|$|The bat'leth is {{considered}} an iconic image of the Star Trek universe. Replicas are widespread and are considered collectibles by some {{and a part of}} Klingon costume. A number of outlets, including replica merchants, weapons dealers and pawn shops sell them. Ronald D. Moore, who has worked on Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica, displays one in his office. However, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> that real bat'leths can pose, no officially licensed replicas of the weapon are available from either Curry or Paramount Pictures.|$|E

5|$|Chandrasekaran, Gnanasekaran and Gunasekaran {{are three}} Indian {{immigrant}} brothers from Madurai, Tamil Nadu living in Rangoon, Burma with Chandrasekaran's wife Saraswati. Their younger sister Kalyani {{was raised in}} their home town by their father Manickampillai. In 1942, during World War II, the three brothers and Saraswati plan to visit Madurai to attend the impending wedding of Kalyani to a writer named Thangappan. Due to war conditions and bombardment of Burmese ports by Japan, the shipping company offers only one ticket and Gunasekaran, the youngest brother, takes it and leaves for Tamil Nadu. The ship fails to reach on time due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> of the war, and Kalyani's marriage takes place without any of her brothers present.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} ten years the city has {{experienced}} an economic, cultural and urban boom. The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation, and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace. This strained Jordan's scarce water supply and exposed Amman <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> of quick expansion without careful municipal planning. Today, Amman is known as a modern, liberal and westernized Arab city, with major mega projects such as the Abdali Urban Regeneration Project and the Jordan Gate Towers. The city contains several high-end hotel franchises including the Four Seasons Hotel Amman, Sheraton Hotel Amman, Fairmont Amman, St. Regis Hotel Amman, Le Royal Hotel and others.|$|E
5|$|Rona's {{methods were}} also used {{as part of the}} {{experiments}} conducted by the Office of Human Radiation Experiments {{to determine the effects of}} human exposure to radiation. Early in her career, she had been exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> of radium. Rona's requests for protective gas masks were denied, as Stefan Meyer downplayed the hazards of exposure. She purchased protective gear with her own money, not believing there was no danger. When vials of radioactive material exploded and the laboratory became contaminated, Rona was convinced her mask had saved her. Gleditsch had also warned her of the dangers the year Rona was sick and living in Paris, when Joliot-Curie died, emphasizing the risk of radium-related anemia. In her 1978 book about her experiences, Rona wrote about the damage to bones, hands, and lungs of the scientists studying radioactivity. Since they wore no gloves and frequently poured substances between vials without protection, she noted that their thumbs, forefingers, and ring fingers were often damaged. The secrecy surrounding the project makes it difficult to know if any of the scientists not directly working on any project knew specifically what their contributions were being used for.|$|E
