50|$|Once {{a current}} account has been opened with a new bank or {{building}} society, the Current Account Switch Service will transfer all the activity relating to the old account to the new one. That includes moving incoming and outgoing payments, and transferring the account balance, as well as closing the old account. An important feature of the service is that though the process happens over seven working days, the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> happens on the final day. This means that customers continue to use the old bank account until the agreed switch day {{and from then on}} use the new bank account. This means that there is no loss of service for any period for the customer.|$|E
40|$|The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> {{technology}} to the southern hemisphere during {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries has been considered previously by Carnegie and Parker (1996), Foreman (2001) and Carnegie et al.

Set at the Cape of Good Hope in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, this study adopts a microhistory approach to evaluate the contribution made by John Pringle, an employee of the East India Company, to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> British-style <b>accounting</b> technology. The circumstances of the time mean that, as an individual, Pringle’s long-term contribution to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> technology was minimal and limited to training the assistants he employed.

40|$|Organizational mechanisms, {{and their}} contexts, leading to gender {{inequality}} among stockbrokers in two large brokerages are analyzed. Inequality {{is the result}} of gender differences in sales, as both firms use performance-based pay, paying entirely by commissions. This paper develops and tests whether performance-support bias, whereby women receive inferior sales support and sales assignments, causes the commissions gap. Newly available data on the brokerages’ internal <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> among brokers allows measurement of performance-support bias. Gender differences in the quality and quantity <b>of</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>accounts</b> provide a way to measure gender differences in the assignment of sales opportunities and support. Sales generated from internally transferred accounts, controlling for the accounts’ sales histories, provide a “natural experiment” testing for gender differences in sales capacities. The evidence for performance-support bias is: (1) women are assigned inferior accounts; and (2) women produce sales equivalent to men when given accounts with equivalent prior sales histories...|$|R

25|$|An {{automated}} teller machine (ATM) is {{a computerized}} telecommunications device that provides the clients of a financial institution with access to financial transactions in a public space {{without the need for}} a cashier, human clerk or bank teller. ATMs are known by various other names including automatic banking machine, cash machine, and various regional variants derived from trademarks on ATM systems held by particular banks. Financial transcationssuch as deposits, withdrawals, and <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> may be conducted at ATM's by inserting an ATM card. In 1939, Armenian-American inventor Luther George Simjian initially {{came up with the idea}} of creating a hole-in-the-wall machine that would allow customers to make financial transactions. The idea was met with a great deal of skepticism after Citicorp tested it. In later years and after Simjian filed 20 patents related to the device, the idea and the gradual usage of ATM's became more widespread around the world.|$|R
30|$|The fully {{decentralized}} {{solution to}} the problem is to let the divisions manage their interrelations. That means that they are free to trade and they can use the accounting system to make the appropriate compensation. That is, they agree on a transfer and simultaneously they agree on a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> income between the divisions. Centers control is placed in having the local profits add up to the total profit, which lends itself to auditing. This would be a negotiated transfer price. The freedom to trade implies that if there are alternative outside options, the transfer price must be closely connected to the outside market. The analysis suggests that this type of solution would only be optimal if the relative size of the items traded is minor in relation to the total local profit. In sum the optimal transfer pricing arrangement depends on the information {{in the hands of the}} decision makers and the information which is useful in contracting between management and divisions.|$|R

The prevalence of massively multiplayer online games (MMORPGs) such as World of Warcraft, Anarchy Online, EverQuest, Guild Wars, and RuneScape {{has resulted in}} the trading of in-game currency for real world currency. This can lead to virtual economies. The rise of virtual economies has led to cheating where a gamer uses macros to gain large amounts of ingame money which the player will then trade for real cash.

40|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} that the presence of the earliest Portuguese accountants in Brazil can be dated to 1549, the earliest official recognition of an association of bookeepers in this ex-Portuguese colony can be dated to 1850. In the case of the British Empire, accountancy emerged as a profession in the late nineteenth-century and this model of professionalism was initially transported to the settler-colonies of this Empire, America, Canada and Australia. In the case of the Portuguese Empire, the development <b>of</b> professional <b>accounting</b> followed a very different trajectory. Here too, {{there is evidence}} <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> technology across international borders. However, in Portuguese colonies, such as Brazil, the professionalism of accountancy does not manifest itself until the mid twentieth century. Drawing on archival based research conducted in both Portugal and Brazil, this study sets out to examine the role of accountancy as a means of control in this ex-colony. In doing so, it also draws attention to the social, political and economic forces that gave rise to differences in the development of accountancy within the contextual settings of these two Empires. Since much of the prior literature pertains to the professionalism of accountancy within Britain and her ex-colonies, with perhaps the exception of the recent work of Dyball et al., this study seeks to contribute to this growing field by focusing on the case of Brazil, a Portuguese ex-colony. Emerging as the product of government initiatives, the first accounting body in Brazil was created in 1946, the Conselho Regional de Contabilidade de Rio de Janeiro (CRC/RJ). Ensuing events crystallized within legislation the functions <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> professionals and drew attention to issues of their perceived status.

The possibility of wide popularization of cloud technologies was defined among small and medium enterprises as medium enterprises mainly use the basic version <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> software and are more loyal in terms of data security unlike large enterprises, for which these actions are risky and cause very powerful changes in financial and human resources because information systems of large enterprises have individual software solutions, contain commercial secrets etc. The article defines the following paramount issues during the transition in the «cloud»: data security in the cloud; compliance of software for a transferring data base; enterprise’s possibility for a return data base at the enterprise if there are poor conditions; flexible platform in the «cloud»; possibility to develop software solutions for enterprises {{depending on the type of}} business; staff training for a work in the cloud. As a result, the study identifies the barriers <b>of</b> <b>transferring</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> data for Ukrainian entrepreneurs and positive results of the transition to the «cloud». The research introduces the model of distribution of resources between the enterprise and service provider depending on the type of cloud computing, and as a result, it is determined that the company’s management chooses the cloud model and the type of cloud computing depending on the amount of resources (human resources: wages to employees of Information Technology; material resources: equipment workplaces, construction of Data Centers; intangible resources: purchase licensed software) taking into consideration currently existing risks <b>of</b> the <b>transferring</b> data base in the cloud (the risk of data loss, the risk of deceleration work of the company which is connected with the possibility of interruption network, flexibility of provider’s platform, etc.) ...|$|R

40|$|It can {{be argued}} that the concept of control {{is one of the most}} {{important}} and yet complex notions <b>of</b> management <b>accounting</b> theory and practice. Despite its importance, it is not fully understood in terms of its significance in an international context. Using an interpretive approach and against the background of structuration theory, this paper explores and identifies differences in notions of control across European cultures. The empirical research is based on samples of narratives of personal experiences taken from respondents in four European countries: Austria, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The results indicate that control is influenced by, and deeply embedded in, the cultural context of the respective countries. This has implications for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> management <b>accounting</b> and control knowledge across different European countries and suggests that one has to be aware of the existence, meaning and significance of the differences and characteristics of the regional culture. In an era of internationalization and standardization, this paper responds to calls (Hopwood, 1999) for research, which emphasizes the importance of attempts to understand how the practices <b>of</b> management <b>accounting</b> and control are differentiated in relation to regional cultures. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MAcc (Accountancy)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The {{potential}} buyer {{of a business}} evaluates the attractiveness of the transaction by considering the financial status of the business being sold. In determining the financial status of a business {{it is more important}} to determine the nature of the assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet rather than the mere existence thereof. Included in the liabilities are accounting provisions recorded in terms of the Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP) to reflect a fair representation of the financial status. Although these provisions are made for accounting purposes, they cannot necessarily be deducted under the terms of the Income Tax Act, no 58 of 1962. The tax deductibility <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> provisions has long been a potential contention when a business is sold. The Income Tax Act has specific sections that must be applied in determining the deductibility <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> provisions, for example, section 11 (a), which is the general deduction formula; section 23 (g), which prohibits expenses not laid out for the purposes of trade; and section 23 (e), which does not allow a deduction when a reserve fund is created (for example a leave pay provision). In conducting this study, seven types <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> provision generally recorded by businesses were identified: the bonus provision, leave pay provision, warranty provision, settlement discount and incentive-rebate provision, post employment provision, retrenchment cost provision and other provisions. These provisions are discussed in view of their possible income tax deductibility, and relevant case studies were identified to confirm the possible deductibility <b>of</b> these <b>accounting</b> provisions. In this study, the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> provisions during the sale of a business is considered for the purposes of both the buyer and seller. The tax implications for the buyer and seller are then evaluated, as well as the subsequent treatment <b>of</b> the <b>accounting</b> provisions for the purposes of the buyer. Because the wording of the purchase contract is extremely important when a business is acquired, three examples of the wording of a purchase contract are discussed as well as the income tax implications thereof. The extent of the advice given by a tax practitioner will depend on the allegiance of the practitioner (either for the buyer or seller) and will determine how the contract will be concluded. In conclusion a tax practitioner would want to assist his client to obtain the most effective tax position for the transaction and therefore each purchase contract must be reviewed on its own set of facts...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{differences}} that has attracted {{a great deal of}} attention is the relatively high average price/earnings (PE) ratio for the stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. A question sometimes raised in the popular press is whether the difference in PEs suggests that US stocks are undervalued or Japanese stocks are overvalued. 1 Of course, such conjectures are not well-founded unless we understand the differences in the institutional characteristics of the two markets. Some of the differences raise subtle but important questions, such as whether a particular institutional arrangement can be adopted in other environments. Just as we have seen the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> US <b>accounting</b> practices to non-US companies active in international capital markets, certain institutional characteristics of Japan's capital markets might lead to related changes in other countries.
