5000|$|In October 1915, Robertson {{used the}} syringe method of {{transfusion}} {{which he had}} learned in New York to perform a transfusion, providing blood to a patient suffering from shrapnel wounds. After four more successful transfusions over several months, he reported his results to Sir Walter Morley Fletcher, director of the Medical Research Committee. [...] In 1916 he wrote an article for the British Medical Journal detailing his results, titled [...] "The Transfusion of Whole Blood: A Suggestion for More Frequent Employment in War Surgery". [...] This, along with improvements in the process developed by British physician Edward William Archibald, persuaded the British authorities to accept the practice of blood transfusion. In 1917 Robertson set up blood <b>transfusion</b> <b>apparatus</b> at Nomber 2 Casualty Clearing Station in France.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the blood compatibility of disposable burette <b>transfusion</b> <b>apparatus</b> and provide the basis for the clinical safety of medical products. Whole blood clotting time (WBCT), prothrombin time(PT),partial prothrombin time(PTT), hemolytic rate and bacterial endotoxin were measured. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the samples and the negative control on indexes of WBCT, PT and PTT (p> 0. 05), hemolysis test showed that the hemolysis rate of the sample was 1. 38 % (less than 5 %), which was coincident with the criteria of the medical devices. Endotoxin levels were lower than 0. 5 EU/ml. All of the results above suggested that the disposable burette <b>transfusion</b> <b>apparatus</b> had a good blood compatibility and no pyrogen...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo observe {{changes in}} RBC count, changes, RBC morphology, and serum {{potassium}} during compressed transfusion of WBC-removal whole blood. MethodsPrepared human WBC-removal whole blood and connected <b>transfusion</b> <b>apparatus</b> with different sizes of intravenous detaining needles (18 G, 20 G, 22 G and 24 G). Observed RBC count and serum potassium concentration under different pressures (100  mmHg, 200  mmHg, and 300  mmHg) as blood flowed {{out of the}} pinhead end of the intravenous detaining needle. Samples obtained with the 20 G needle were smeared on glass slides, and RBC morphologic changes were observed under an oil immersion lens. ResultsRBC count and serum potassium changed slightly under different pressures with different sizes of intravenous detaining needles as blood flowed through the <b>transfusion</b> <b>apparatus.</b> In addition, the observation of blood samples under a common light microscope revealed that coarse-prick, oblong, and spindle cell counts in the visual fields increased gradually as the pressure increased. Additionally, a portion of cells had undergone splintering. ConclusionsWhile applying 18 G, 20 G, 22 G and 24 G intravenous detaining needles for blood transfusion under less than 300  mmHg of pressure, no significant RBC count change was found in blood samples in the short term. However, there were significant RBC morphologic changes. The results could offer more basis to ensure the clinical safety of patients undergoing blood transfusion...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Transfusion {{guidelines}} advise against coinfusing {{red blood}} cells (RBCs) with solutions other than 0. 9 % saline. We evaluated the impact of coinfusion with dextrose-containing fluids (DW) on markers of RBC quality. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A pool-and-split design was used to allow conditions to be tested on each pool within 2 hours of irradiation. Three pools at each storage age (5, 14, and 21 days) were created for each phase. In Phase 1, samples were infused through a neonatal <b>transfusion</b> <b>apparatus</b> alone or with treatment solutions: D 5 W, D 10 W, D 5 W/ 0. 2 % saline, and 0. 9 % saline. In Phase 2, samples were incubated alone or in a 1 : 1 ratio with treatment solutions and tested after 5, 30, and 180 minutes. Hemolysis, supernatant potassium, RBC indices, morphology, and deformability were measured on all samples. RESULTS: In Phase 1, RBCs transfused alone through the apparatus had higher (p< 0. 01) hematocrit, total hemoglobin, and supernatant potassium compared to all other groups. No statistical differences were identified between groups for other measured variables. In Phase 2, mean corpuscular volume of all samples containing DW increased with incubation length and were higher (p< 0. 01) than RBCs incubated alone or with 0. 9 % saline after 30 and 180 minutes. RBCs incubated with D 5 W and D 5 W/ 0. 2 % saline had greater (p< 0. 05) hemolysis than RBCs alone after 180 minutes. CONCLUSION: In vitro characteristics of RBCs coinfused with 0. 9 % saline or D 10 W were not adversely impacted. When developing clinical studies in neonates, we recommend use of D 10 W and a <b>transfusion</b> <b>apparatus</b> that minimizes the contact volume of the coinfusate with the RBC. Amy K.
