As {{a member of the}} Ross Sea party in Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, Joyce earned an Albert Medal for his actions in bringing <b>the</b> <b>stricken</b> party to safety, after a traumatic journey on the Great Ice Barrier. He was awarded the Polar Medal with four bars, one of only two men to be so honoured, the other being his contemporary, Frank Wild.|$|E

Tuckers efforts, and those of the five other American destroyers who were also present, were rewarded by a commendation from the Préfet Maritime, on behalf of the French Ministry of Marine.|$|E
5|$|Judy (1936 – 17 February 1950) was a ship's dog {{on board}} HMS Gnat and HMS Grasshopper {{stationed}} on the Yangtze {{before and during}} World War II. She proved able to hear incoming aircraft, providing the crew with an early warning. After part of the crew transferred from the Gnat to the Grasshopper in June 1939 the ship was sent to Singapore after the British declaration of war on Germany. There she was on board the ship during the Battle of Singapore, which saw Grasshopper evacuate for the Dutch East Indies. It was sunk en route, and Judy was nearly killed having been trapped by a falling row of lockers. She was rescued when a crewman returned to <b>the</b> <b>stricken</b> vessel looking for supplies.|$|E

News reports indicated that these bodies had apparently been thrown clear on impact, and had come to rest alongside the tail section of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The third (and final) {{practice}} session {{started with a}} morning sleet shower and Anthony Davidson in Toyota's No. 5 entry drove off the circuit at Luffield turn. Davidson later aquaplaned backwards off the track and into the Chapel corner gravel trap. The session was stopped to allow <b>the</b> <b>stricken</b> Toyota to be extracted from the gravel trap and and {{it was able to}} return to the pit lane with assistance from a recovery crane, allowing on-track action to recommence. Sleet later turned to snow necessitating track officials to stop the session for the second time. Driver adviser Yannick Dalmas was asked to assess the track's condition during the stoppage and gave feedback that prompted the session's premature end with half an hour remaining. Eleven cars took to the track but nobody recorded a timed lap. Tincknell completed the most out-laps of any driver in the session with three.|$|E
5|$|With {{the wind}} strengthening, Schomberg marshalled his forces and {{advanced}} on Roquebert's squadron. The French were clustered together {{in support of}} Néréide, whose crew were attempting to make hasty repairs while the squadron limped in a northwesterly direction towards Madagascar. Following the French lights, Schomberg pursued the French in the darkness and when Clorinde lost a man overboard and stopped to rescue him at 21:50, Roquebert was forced to fall back and protect his consort from being overwhelmed. Steering Renommée directly at Astraea, Roquebert opened fire at close range but was soon surrounded, with Astraea on one side, Racehorse on the other and Phoebe raking her stern. In a ferocious 25 minute engagement, Roquebert was killed and the French flagship suffered severe damage, surrendering after a shot from Racehorse ignited her mainsail. The British ships were also badly damaged: Racehorse was unable to launch a boat to take possession of Renommée due to a fallen topmast on her deck and Astraeas boats all badly damaged by shot and leaked severely during the short row to <b>the</b> <b>stricken</b> French vessel.|$|E

5|$|Glasgow pursued Leipzig, {{and quickly}} caught up, opening fire by 14:40. After {{about twenty minutes}} of firing, Leipzig was hit; she turned to port to open the range, before turning to {{starboard}} {{in order to bring}} her full broadside into action. In the ensuing action, both ships were hit several times, forcing Glasgow to break off and fall behind the more powerful armored cruisers. Leipzig was battered severely by Cornwall and Kent and set on fire; she nevertheless remained in action and continued to fight. In the course of the engagement, Leipzig hit Cornwall eighteen times, causing a significant list to port. She fired three torpedoes at the British ships, but failed to score any hits with them. At 19:20, Haun issued the order to scuttle his wrecked ship; the British approached and opened fire on <b>the</b> <b>stricken</b> cruiser at close range, killing large numbers of the crew. The British also destroyed a cutter filled with survivors, killing all of them. Leipzig finally capsized and sank at 21:05, with Haun going down with his ship. Only eighteen men were pulled from the freezing water.|$|E
5|$|Kroonlands lifeboat, {{manned by}} a fresh crew, headed {{back out and}} {{returned}} with 13 steerage passengers. On board Volturno, the crew {{and some of the}} male passengers, unable to extinguish the fire, were at least able to keep it from spreading to the aft cargo holds, over which the others on board were gathered. Shortly before dawn, a large explosion—probably of her boilers—rocked Volturno, and the rescuers felt that the ship, which had not been in imminent danger of sinking up to this point, might founder at any time. The tanker Narragansett turned on her pumps and sprayed lubricating oil on the sea to help calm the surface. The combined effect of the oil and the lessening of the storm allowed many more lifeboats to be sent to Volturnos aid. Kroonland launched two more boats herself and saved 75 more, including Captain Inch, the last person to leave <b>the</b> <b>stricken</b> ship. In all, some 520 passengers and crew were rescued by the ten ships—89 on Kroonland alone. The loss of life was limited to around 130, mostly women and children from the early lifeboat launchings.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{previous}} day, 3 May, the 57th/60th Infantry Battalion had begun operating along the parallel Commando Road to the north. Here {{they had a}} number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling, which resulted in them being ambushed. They also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching, and crossing the river, arriving there on 6 May. On 5 May, along the Buin Road, the 24th Infantry Battalion had pressed forward again. Advancing with a tank troop in support, they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately 100 Japanese. After the lead Matilda's machine gun jammed, the field gun opened fire on it, damaging it and wounding its crew. Moving around <b>the</b> <b>stricken</b> tank, the second Matilda, armed with a howitzer, opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the Japanese defenders from the position. That night, the Japanese artillery opened up on the Australian position with a heavy barrage, and the following morning put in a company-sized counter-attack. The fighting lasted for over two-and-a-half hours, but when it was over the Australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack. In doing so, they suffered one killed and nine wounded, while the attacking Japanese had suffered heavily, losing 58 men killed. It was the biggest loss since the action at Slater's Knoll and it spelt the end of their attempt to defend the Hongorai.|$|E

5|$|The late 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries were years of {{lawlessness}} on Lundy, {{particularly during the}} ownership of Thomas Benson (1708-1772), a Member of Parliament for Barnstaple in 1747 and Sheriff of Devon, who notoriously used the island for housing convicts whom {{he was supposed to}} be deporting. Benson leased Lundy from its owner, John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower (1694–1754) (who was an heir of the Grenville family of Bideford and of Stowe, Kilkhampton in Cornwall), at a rent of £60 per annum and contracted with the Government to transport a shipload of convicts to Virginia, but diverted the ship to Lundy to use the convicts as his personal slaves. Later Benson was involved in an insurance swindle. He purchased and insured the ship Nightingale and loaded it with a valuable cargo of pewter and linen. Having cleared the port on the mainland, the ship put into Lundy, where the cargo was removed and stored in a cave built by the convicts, before setting sail again. Some days afterwards, when a homeward-bound vessel was sighted, the Nightingale was set on fire and scuttled. The crew were taken off <b>the</b> <b>stricken</b> ship by the other ship, which landed them safely at Clovelly.|$|E
5|$|Chennai {{was officially}} {{declared}} a disaster {{area on the}} evening of 2 December. At the MIOT Hospital, 14 patients died after power and oxygen supplies failed. With a letup in rainfall, floodwaters gradually began to recede in Chennai on 4 December, though 40 percent of the city's districts remained submerged and safe food and drinking water remained in short supply. Though relief efforts were well underway across most of the area by 3 December, the lack of any coordinated relief response in North Chennai forced thousands of its residents to evacuate on their own. As intermittent rains returned, thousands of displaced residents from Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts attempted to flee <b>the</b> <b>stricken</b> region by bus or train and travel to their family homes. Chennai International Airport was partly reopened for cargo flights on 5 December, with passenger flights scheduled to resume from the following morning. By 6 December, rescue efforts had largely concluded and relief efforts intensified, with the Chennai Corporation beginning to disburse relief packages. Mobile, banking and power services were gradually restored; fuel and food supplies were reaching their destinations, the airport had fully reopened and rail services slowly resumed. Many city neighbourhoods, however, remained flooded with some lacking basic necessities due to the uncoordinated distribution of relief materials. With the city slowly beginning to recover, state and national health officials remained watchful against disease outbreaks, warning that conditions were right for epidemics of water-borne illnesses to occur. Chennai Corporation officials reported at least 57,000 homes in the city had suffered structural damage, mostly those of working class pincodes. State housing boards said they would conduct safety inspections of both public and residential buildings. After being closed for the past month, schools and colleges across the affected districts began to reopen from 14 December. Relief operations were largely wound up by 19 December.|$|E
5|$|On September16, strong waves {{produced}} by the hurricane disabled the Swedish freighter Laponia, {{which at the time}} was located 300mi (480km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The ship was initially en route for Rio de Janeiro carrying cargo for the Bethlehem Steel Company. As a result of the stranded ship, the SS President Roosevelt was forced to divert its course in order to render aid. The United States Coast Guard cutters USCGC Sebago (WHEC-42) and USCGC Carrabasset (WAT-55) were sent from the Virginia Capes in order to provide assistance. In addition, a coast guard plane was dispatched from Elizabeth City, North Carolina. The ships remained on standby to monitor the Laponia for three hours before conditions were considered safe to tow <b>the</b> <b>stricken</b> ship back to shore. Two fishing vessels capsized off Barnegat and Edgemere, New York, with both incidents resulting in a fatality. A cabin cruiser was sent to rescue occupants of the capsized boat off Edgemere, though it was also disrupted by rough seas. The ship was later able to rescue the other surviving crew members. Numerous other small craft off Long Island signaled distress calls to the US Coast Guard due to strong waves offshore. Eventually passing east of New England, the storm's large size resulted in heavy rainfall near Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. A weather station on the island reported maximum sustained winds of 45mph (70km/h). In Eastport, Maine, a weather station recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 993mbar (hPa; 29.33inHg) and wind speeds of 33mph (53km/h). In Maine, power lines were downed, damaging communications. In Bar Harbor, strong winds caused five fires, which were later extinguished. The schooner George Dresser ran aground on the port's coast. The hurricane also produced slight snowfalls in northern areas of the state.|$|E
