5|$|Among P. labiata {{and some}} other Portias, when adults of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species</b> but {{opposite}} sexes recognise each other, they display at 10 to 30centimetres. Males usually wait for 2 to 15minutes before starting a display, but sometimes a female starts a display first.|$|E

5|$|Another {{analogous}} case {{within a}} single species has been termed Browerian mimicry (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower). This {{is a case of}} bipolar (only two species involved) automimicry; the model is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species</b> as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry {{within a single}} species, it occurs when there is a palatability spectrum within a population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants, and store these toxins within themselves. The more palatable caterpillars thus profit from the more toxic members of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E

5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{regarded}} Geastrum indicum as the correct name for G.triplex. This is because G.indicum—a species described by Johann Friedrich Klotzsch in 1832 as Cycloderma indicum {{and then moved}} to Geastrum by Stephan Rauschert in 1959—may be <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species</b> as Geastrum triplex. If {{it is in fact}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species,</b> the first published name (i.e., G.indicum) has nomenclatorial priority according to the rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. More recently, several authors argue that G.indicum should be rejected as a nomen dubium and G.triplex maintained as the correct name for the species.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1853. The type collection {{was made by}} American botanist Henry William Ravenel in South Carolina. Joseph Ammirati and Howard Bigelow considered Cortinarius heliotropicus, described by Charles Horton Peck 1914, to be <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species</b> as C.iodes after examining the holotype specimens of both. According to the nomenclatural databases MycoBank and Index Fungorum, however, Cortinarius iodes {{does not have any}} synonyms. If they are indeed <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species,</b> the name C.iodes has priority. C.iodes is classified in the subgenus Myxacium, along with other Cortinarius species that have a slimy cap and stem.|$|E
5|$|When hunting, mature {{females of}} P. fimbriata, P. africana, P. fimbriata, P. labiata, and P. schultzi emit {{olfactory}} signals that {{reduce the risk}} that any other females, males or juveniles of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species</b> may contend for the same prey. The effect inhibits aggressive mimicry against a prey spider even if the prey spider is visible, and also if the prey is inhabiting any part of a web. If a female {{of one of these}} Portias smells a male of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species,</b> the female stimulates the males to court. These Portia species do not show this behaviour when they receive olfactory signals from members of other Portia species.|$|E

60|$|As Gartner {{found that}} there was {{sometimes}} an innate difference in different INDIVIDUALS of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> two <b>species</b> in crossing; so Sagaret believes this to be the case with different individuals of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> two <b>species</b> in being grafted together. As in reciprocal crosses, the facility of effecting an union is often very far from equal, so it sometimes is in grafting. The common gooseberry, for instance, cannot be grafted on the currant, whereas the currant will take, though with difficulty, on the gooseberry.|$|R

5|$|When meeting {{another of}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species,</b> P. fimbriata does not stalk but {{displays}} by moving quickly and smoothly, and displays at 4 to 27centimetres away. It raises its legs, its body sways {{from side to}} side, and the palps are lowered below the chelicerae ("fangs"). This {{is very different from}} the stalking it uses when encountering another salticid of a different species, despite receiving the same visual stimulus, the sight of the other's large anterior-median eyes. Although P. fimbriata is influenced by pheromones much more than is usual among salticids, visual cues alone are enough to start displays and distinguish members of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species</b> from other salticids, even if neither partner moves. The spindly, fringed legs of Portia species may identify members of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species,</b> as well as concealing these spiders from other salticid species.|$|E
5|$|According to the IUCN, further taxonomic {{investigation}} {{is required to}} confirm the black dogfish in the North Atlantic and the southeastern Atlantic represent <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species.</b> A 2010 phylogenetic study by Nicolas Straube and colleagues, based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, found the black dogfish is the sister species of the whitefin dogfish (C.ritteri), and the two are, in turn, sister to the clade formed by the granular dogfish (C.granulatum) and combtooth dogfish (C.nigrum).|$|E

5|$|Alfred Gardner and James Patton {{suggested}} in 1976 that Allen's O.rivularis may be <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species</b> as O.bombycinus. They considered O.bolivaris as probably {{the same as}} O.nitidus and listed castaneus as a synonym of O.capito (equivalent to modern Hylaeamys megacephalus and closely related species plus Transandinomys talamancae). In 1984, Benshoof and colleagues reported the first record of Oryzomys bombycinus from Honduras. Guy Musser and Marina Williams reviewed O.talamancae in 1985 and included O.castaneus {{as one of its}} synonyms, though without having examined the holotype. In the 1993 second edition of Mammal Species of the World, Musser and Michael Carleton used the name Oryzomys bolivaris for the species previously known as O.bombycinus, and in 1998, Musser and colleagues fully documented the allocation of the names bolivaris, castaneus, rivularis, bombycinus, alleni, and orinus to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>species,</b> Oryzomys bolivaris. They noted its similarity to O.talamancae, but did not attempt to determine phylogenetic relationships among the species they discussed. In their limited material, they found geographic variation within the species inconsequential and they recognized no subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Bakerian mimicry, {{named after}} Herbert G. Baker, {{is a form}} of automimicry where female flowers mimic male flowers of their own species, {{cheating}} pollinators out of a reward.

It is common in many species of Caricaceae.|$|E

In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka deemed Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus to represent separate genera because Nemegtosaurus was at this time {{considered to be a}} member of the Dicraeosauridae, while Opisthocoelicaudia seemed to be a representative of a different group, the Camarasauridae.|$|E
