5|$|Behind the scenes, Welensky and the Rhodesians {{had been}} courting <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives,</b> while the native Africans {{had been doing}} the same with Labour. A British general {{election}} was held in 1951 and <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> gained power. Labour, mindful of the overwhelming opposition of Africans from both Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and of the Colonial Office mandate to oversee native interests, had been lukewarm at best {{to the idea of}} federation, and had been wholly opposed to amalgamation. After the election, the bipartisan approach to federation broke down and the British laws for its creation passed only with the support of <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives,</b> with both Liberal and Labour Parties now opposed.|$|E
5|$|Blake further {{notes that}} it was the Liberals, not <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> who needed the moral outrage of Belgium to justify going to war, while <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> called for {{intervention}} {{from the start of the}} crisis on the grounds of realpolitik and the balance of power.|$|E

5|$|Opinion {{polls in}} September 1990 {{reported}} that Labour {{had established a}} 14% lead over <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives,</b> and by November <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> had been trailing Labour for 18months. These ratings, together with Thatcher's combative personality and tendency to override collegial opinion, contributed to discontent within her party.|$|E
5|$|By 1876, Macdonald and <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> {{had adopted}} {{protection}} as party policy. This view was widely promoted in speeches {{at a number}} of political picnics, held across Ontario during the summer of 1876. Macdonald's proposals struck a chord with the public, and <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> began to win a string of by-elections. By the end of 1876, the Tories had picked up 14seats as a result of by-elections, reducing Mackenzie's Liberal majority from 70 to 42. Despite the success, Macdonald considered retirement, wishing only to reverse the voters' verdict of 1874—he considered Charles Tupper his heir apparent.|$|E

5|$|In the Khaki Election of 1900, {{nationalist}} {{concern with}} the Boer War meant that <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> and their Liberal Unionist allies gained a majority of Scottish seats for the first time, although the Liberals regained their ascendancy in the next election. Various organisations, including the Independent Labour Party, joined to make the British Labour Party in 1906, with Keir Hardie as its first chairman. The Unionists and Conservatives merged in 1912, usually known as <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> in England and Wales, they adopted the name Unionist Party in Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Political {{plans were}} thrown into disarray by Palmerston's death on 18 October 1865. Russell became Prime Minister again, with Gladstone clearly the Liberal Party's leader-in-waiting, and as Leader of the House Disraeli's direct opponent. One of Russell's early {{priorities}} was a Reform Bill, but the proposed legislation that Gladstone announced on 12 March 1866 divided his party. <b>The</b> <b>Conservatives</b> and the dissident Liberals repeatedly attacked Gladstone's bill, and in June finally defeated the government; Russell resigned on 26 June. The dissidents {{were unwilling to}} serve under Disraeli in the House of Commons, and Derby formed a third Conservative minority government, with Disraeli again as Chancellor. In 1867, <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> introduced a Reform Bill. Without {{a majority in the}} Commons, <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> {{had little choice but to}} accept amendments that considerably liberalised the legislation, though Disraeli refused to accept any from Gladstone.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} bill first passed the Commons, Baird {{acknowledged}} that <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> might have unintentionally broken political financing laws {{by failing to}} report convention fees collected in 2005. He told a Senate committee that $1.7 million was left unreported {{and that he did}} not realize it was an issue at the time. The matter is under review by the Chief Electoral Officer. <b>The</b> <b>Conservatives</b> quietly tabled an amendment to the Accountability Act in November 2006, stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, Sihanouk {{ordered the}} arrest of Chinese {{middlemen}} involved in the illegal rice trade, thereby raising government revenues and placating <b>the</b> <b>conservatives.</b> Lon Nol was forced to resign, and, in a typical move, the prince named new leftists to the government to balance <b>the</b> <b>conservatives.</b> The immediate crisis had passed, but it engendered two tragic consequences. First, it drove thousands of new recruits {{into the arms of}} the hard-line maquis of the Cambodian Communist Party (which Sihanouk labelled the Khmers rouges ("Red Khmers")). Second, for the peasantry, the name of Lon Nol became associated with ruthless repression throughout Cambodia.|$|E

5|$|The Speaker is Liberal Peter Milliken. Milliken was re-elected as the Speaker of the House for the 39th Parliament on April 3, 2006. The Speaker only {{votes in}} a tie, and, as Milliken is a Liberal, the Liberal caucus was {{effectively}} reduced by one. This, {{along with the}} defection of Wajid Khan to <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> enabled <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> to pass legislation {{with the cooperation of}} any one of the three opposition parties: Liberals, Bloc Québécois, or New Democratic Party (NDP).|$|E
