5|$|In 1341, King Edward III visited Norwich for a jousting tournament, {{coinciding with}} the {{completion}} of the city's defensive walls. Edward and his mother, Isabella of France, were very impressed by the city and, as a token of appreciation for bearing the costs of the defensive fortifications, Edward granted the franchise of <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>to</b> the city in perpetuity. The control by the King's Clerk over trade at the market was ended and tolls and rents from the market from then on went directly to the city's bailiffs (the rulers of the city).|$|E

5|$|The castle {{became the}} {{administrative}} centre for the earldom {{and was used}} by Robert's court. There was already an existing market held at nearby St Stephen's church by the local canons, but Robert appropriated it and moved <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>to</b> outside his new castle, intending {{to profit from the}} trade. A watermill was built to the south-west of the castle.|$|E
5|$|Although superficially {{the market}} {{remained}} little {{changed in the}} decades following the 1930s redevelopment, by the 1960s it was falling into disrepair, and it no longer met modern hygiene regulations. A lack of funds delayed improvement works, and renovation works did not begin until February 1976. Hot and cold running water and refrigeration were provided to those stalls handling food, {{and many of the}} stalls were converted into lockable units. New electrical mains cables were installed throughout the market, the site was resurfaced, and the elegant but ageing 19thcentury lavatories were demolished. Aside from the demolition of the Victorian toilets, the only significant visible alteration was the addition of corrugated plastic covers over the walkways between the stalls. Although competition from supermarkets was by this time affecting shopping patterns, and the decline of market gardening meant a virtual end to stall-holders selling their own produce, the market survived competitive pressures. Many stalls diversified into specialist foods, clothing and other goods and the high number of stalls allowed <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>to</b> sell a range of goods as great as that provided by the supermarkets.|$|E
5|$|At {{conferences}} in 1946 and 1947, {{the decision was}} made to breed Haflinger horses from pure bloodlines, creating a closed stud book with no new blood being introduced. The Tyrolean Haflinger Breeders' Association established its own stallion center and prohibited private breeders from keeping stallions, thus ensuring that the association maintained 100percent control of breeding stallions. In Bavaria, several young stallions had been saved and breeders could privately own stallions. Bavarian and Tyrolean breeders maintained close ties and cooperated extensively. North Tyrolean breeders were also able to acquire several high-quality older stallions and lower-quality young stallions from South Tyrol. In 1947, the Federation of Austrian Haflinger Breeders was established as a governing organization for the provincial associations. At this time a large-scale breed show was held, attended by visitors from Switzerland, who soon after their return home sent a purchasing commission to Austria and were instrumental in founding the Haflinger population in Switzerland. Southern Tyrol had no difficulty in selling its horses, as all of Italy was in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>to</b> purchase horses, and breeding populations spread as far south as Sicily.|$|E

5|$|By the 14thcentury, Norwich {{was one of}} {{the largest}} and most prosperous cities in England, and Norwich Market was a major trading hub. Control of, and income from, the market was ceded by the monarchy to the city of Norwich in 1341, from which time it {{provided}} a significant source of income for the local council. Freed from royal control, the market was reorganised to benefit the city as much as possible. Norwich and the surrounding region were devastated by plague and famine in the latter half of the 14thcentury, with the population falling by over 50%. Following the plague years, Norwich came under the control of local merchants and the economy was rebuilt. In the early 15thcentury, a Guildhall was built next to <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>to</b> serve as a centre for local government and law enforcement. The largest surviving mediaeval civic building in Britain outside London, it remained the seat of local government until 1938 and in use as a law court until 1985.|$|E
5|$|Dunster {{had become}} a centre for woollen and {{clothing}} production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and {{a particular kind of}} kersey or broadcloth became known as 'Dunsters'. The prosperity of Dunster was based on the wool trade, with profits helping to pay for the construction of the tower of the Priory Church of St George and provide other amenities. By the 15th century the importance of the town was declining particularly due to the silting up of the harbour. The Luttrell's wanted to maintain the importance as a market and in 1609 George Luttrell, of the Luttrell family constructed <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>to</b> shelter traders and their wares from the rain and provide more security for their wares. The exact date of construction is debated and a variety of dates are given in different sources, however 1609 is considered the most likely.|$|E
5|$|Perón's second Five-Year Plan in 1952 favoured {{increased}} agricultural output over industrialization, but {{industrial growth}} and high wages {{in previous years}} had expanded the domestic demand for agrarian goods. During the 1950s, output of beef and grain fell, and the economy suffered. The policy shift toward agricultural production created a gap in income distribution, as {{the majority of those}} who worked in agriculture laboured on tiny plots, while the majority of the land was in large estates. Argentina signed trade agreements with Britain, the Soviet Union and Chile, slightly opening <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>to</b> international trade as Perón's second economic plan sought to capitalize on the country's comparative advantage in agriculture.|$|E

First, we show that <b>the</b> <b>market</b> reaction <b>to</b> joint venture announcements is significantly positive, whilst similar announcements from individual companies do not elicit any response. Second, we find that <b>the</b> <b>market</b> reaction <b>to</b> single company investments is positively related {{to the size of}} the expenditure, but only for projects which immediately generate cash. Finally, we report that the variability in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> response <b>to</b> announcements which follow large cash inflows is significantly lower than the variability in investors' reactions to announcements which are not preceded by such inflows.

On the final day of shooting, Freda left the set which led to the cinematographer Mario Bava to direct the rest of the film, which changed various plot points and added the inclusion of stock footage.|$|E
5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of a young chocolatier in 1880, during the Victorian era. The game has two modes of play: story and free play. Story mode {{involves}} a number of quests, including delivering specific chocolates and restoring the fictional Baumeister chocolate empire to its former glory. The player is enlisted by Evangeline Baumeister to rebuild the Baumeister chocolate empire which has been ruined by Evangeline's younger sister who scattered chocolate recipes around the world. The player must locate the 64 lost recipes, visit 14 different cities around the globe, purchase 6 closed Baumeister factories, establish business relationships with outlets and suppliers, and manufacture chocolates to keep in business. Free play mode allows the player to travel, manufacture, and trade without undertaking quests. This mode starts the player {{with a small amount of}} cash and all chocolate recipes unlocked for use. In story mode, players begin with a single factory and a recipe for simple chocolate bars, the player must visit <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>to</b> purchase ingredients and begin the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|With {{the powers}} of the King's Clerk abolished, the bailiffs of Norwich set about {{regulating}} the operation of the market for what they felt was the greatest benefit to the city. To encourage fair competition among the market's traders, it was forbidden to sell foodstuffs before the Cathedral bell had tolled for Lady Mass (6.00am). The practice of forestalling (meeting merchants {{on their way to the}} market either to buy their goods for resale, or to prevent them from attending the market and thus make goods of the type they were selling scarce and hence more expensive) was forbidden. Trading anywhere other than in the market was strongly discouraged and the right to re-sell goods at a profit was restricted to Freemen of the city. The prices of bread and beer were fixed, and a set of standardised weights and measures was introduced, against which measures used by merchants would regularly be checked. Shortly after the transfer of <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>to</b> the city a market cross was erected near the centre of the main market (opposite the present day entrance to Davey Place), the design of which is not recorded.|$|E

5|$|Worldwide use {{of solar}} power and wind power {{continued}} to grow significantly in 2012. Solar electricity consumption increased by 58 percent, to 93 terawatt-hours (TWh). Use of wind power in 2012 increased by 18.1 percent, to 521.3 TWh. Global solar and wind energy installed capacities continued to expand even though new investments in these technologies declined during 2012. Worldwide investment in solar power in 2012 was $140.4billion, an 11 percent decline from 2011, and wind power investment was down 10.1 percent, to $80.3billion. But due to lower production costs for both technologies, total installed capacities grew sharply. This investment decline, but growth in installed capacity, may again occur in 2013.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} investor sentiment on <b>the</b> <b>market</b> reaction <b>to</b> dividend change announcements. Design/methodology/approach: We use the European Economic Sentiment Indicator data, from Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN), {{as a proxy for}} investor sentiment and focus on <b>the</b> <b>market</b> reaction <b>to</b> dividend change announcements, using panel data methodology. Findings: Using data from three European markets, our results indicate that the investor sentiment has some influence on <b>the</b> <b>market</b> reaction <b>to</b> dividend change announcements, for two of <b>the</b> three analysed <b>markets.</b> Globally, we find no evidence of investor sentiment influencing <b>the</b> <b>market</b> reaction <b>to</b> dividend change announcements for <b>the</b> Portuguese <b>market.</b> However, we find evidence that the positive share price reaction to dividend increases enlarges with sentiment, in the case of <b>the</b> UK <b>markets,</b> whereas <b>the</b> negative share price reaction to dividend decreases reduces with sentiment, in <b>the</b> French <b>market.</b> Research limitations/implications: We have no access to dividend forecasts, so, our findings are based on naïve dividend changes and not unexpected change dividends. Originality/value: This paper offers some insights on the effect of investor sentiment on <b>the</b> <b>market</b> reaction <b>to</b> firms’ news, a strand of finance that is scarcely developed and contributes to the analysis of European markets that are in need of research. As the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the effect of investor sentiment on <b>the</b> <b>market</b> reaction <b>to</b> dividend news, in the context of European markets...|$|R
