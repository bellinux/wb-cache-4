The king had a financial interest in enforcement, for part of the fines would come to him in many cases, but the king also was responsible for law and order, and avoiding blood feuds by enforcing the rules on compensation for injury was part of the way the king maintained control. Æthelberht's laws are mentioned by Alfred the Great, who compiled his own laws, making use of the prior codes created by Æthelberht, {{as well as those of}} Offa of Mercia and Ine of Wessex.|$|E

The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).

Criminal law varies according to jurisdiction, and differs from civil law, where emphasis is more on dispute resolution and victim compensation than on punishment.|$|E

Bahá'í law and teachings do not include details on many aspects of life, and the successive heads of the religion have been reluctant to prescribe specific and detailed codes of Bahá'í behaviour; for example the heads of the religion have stated that details of Bahá'í behaviour, such as how to dress, are a matter of individual choice and not Bahá'í law. This is in contrast to the provisions of Islamic law.|$|E

25|$|Particle physics codified {{the basic}} laws of {{dynamics}} into the standard model. This is formulated as a {{quantum field theory}} that has CPT symmetry, i.e., <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>are</b> invariant under simultaneous operation of time reversal, parity and charge conjugation. However, time reversal itself is seen {{not to be a}} symmetry (this is usually called CP violation). There are two possible origins of this asymmetry, one through the mixing of different flavours of quarks in their weak decays, the second through a direct CP violation in strong interactions. The first is seen in experiments, the second is strongly constrained by the non-observation of the EDM of a neutron.|$|E
25|$|A law of Boolean algebra is an {{identity}} such as x∨(y∨z) = (x∨y)∨z between two Boolean terms, where a Boolean term {{is defined as}} an expression built up from variables and the constants 0 and 1 using the operations ∧, ∨, and ¬. The concept can be extended to terms involving other Boolean operations such as ⊕, →, and ≡, but such extensions are unnecessary for the purposes to which <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>are</b> put. Such purposes include {{the definition of a}} Boolean algebra as any model of the Boolean laws, and as a means for deriving new laws from old as in the derivation of x∨(y∧z) = x∨(z∧y) from y∧z = z∧y as treated in the section on axiomatization.|$|E

Many of Asimov's robot-focused stories involve robots behaving in unusual and counter-intuitive ways as an unintended consequence of how the robot applies the Three Laws to the situation in which it finds itself. Other authors working in Asimov's fictional universe have adopted them and references, often parodic, appear throughout science fiction as well as in other genres.|$|E

One {{of the causes}} of it is narrow undersanding of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> always considered as te act and <b>the</b> <b>law</b> centainty <b>is</b> a same as the act certainty. The maturity of understanding representing <b>law</b> <b>is</b> an act then delivering the view that the most important <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> centainty cousing that <b>the</b> justice of <b>law</b> <b>is</b> ignored, and also criticism amongst the lawyers. It results in repressive law offering solution for the delay of justice. This <b>law</b> <b>is</b> based on <b>the</b> principle that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> made for human being hence <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> supporting <b>the</b> people and justice.

25|$|In Chullin 92a-b Ulla {{says that}} here are 30 laws which {{the sons of}} Noah took upon themselves. However he only lists three, namely the three that the Gentiles follow: not to create a Ketubah between males, not to sell carrion {{in the market and}} to respect the Torah. The rest of <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>are</b> not listed. Talmud {{commentator}} Rashi remarks on this that he does not know the other Commandments that are referred to. Though the authorities seem to take it for granted that Ulla's thirty commandments included the original seven, an additional thirty laws is also possible from the reading. Two different lists of the 30 laws exist. Both lists include an additional twenty-three mitzvot which are subdivisions or extensions of the seven laws. One from the 16th-century work Asarah Maamarot by Rabbi Menahem Azariah da Fano and a second from the 10th century Samuel ben Hofni which was recently published from his Judeo-Arabic writings after having been found in the Cairo Geniza. Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Chajes suggests Menahem Azariah of Fano enumerated commandments are not related to the first seven, nor based on Scripture, but instead were passed down by oral tradition.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} to this issue. One {{approach is to}} argue that all real forces drop off with distance from their sources in a known manner, so we have only {{to be sure that}} a body is far enough away from all sources to ensure that no force is present. A possible issue with this approach is the historically long-lived view that the distant universe might affect matters (Mach's principle). Another approach is to identify all real sources for real forces and account for them. A possible issue with this approach is that we might miss something, or account inappropriately for their influence, perhaps, again, due to Mach's principle and an incomplete understanding of the universe. A third approach {{is to look at the}} way the forces transform when we shift reference frames. Fictitious forces, those that arise due to the acceleration of a frame, disappear in inertial frames, and have complicated rules of transformation in general cases. On the basis of universality of physical law and the request for frames where <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>are</b> most simply expressed, inertial frames are distinguished by the absence of such fictitious forces.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a maximum}} of 15 players from each team on a rugby field at one time. The players {{position}} {{at the start of}} the game is indicated by the number on the back of their shirts, 1 to 15. The positions are divided into two main categories; forwards (numbered 1 to 8) and backs (numbered 9 to 15). In international matches, there are eight substitutes that can replace an on-field team member. The substitutes, numbered 16 to 23, can either take up the position of the player they replace or the on-field players can be shuffled to make room for this player in another position. Typically, the replacement players will have a number that corresponds with their intended replacement position with the numbers from 16 to 20 being forwards and 21 to 23 being backs (depending on the composition of the reserves). There are no personal squad numbers and a versatile player's position and number may change from one game to the next. Players can also change positions with players on the field during the match, and, as long as <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>are</b> followed, any player can change positions with another player during the match. Common examples are the fly-half playing the full-back's position in defence or a prop taking the hooker's position at line-outs.|$|E

In addition to the focus of the laws themselves, the introduction makes clear the importance of the Church in the legislative process.
