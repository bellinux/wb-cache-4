40|$|Four {{erosive burning}} models, {{equations}} (11) to (14). are developed {{in this work}} by using a power law relationship to correlate (1) the erosive burning ratio and the local velocity gradient at propellant surfaces; (2) the erosive burning ratio and the velocity gradient divided by centerline velocity; (3) the erosive burning difference and the local velocity gradient at propellant surfaces; and (4) the erosive burning difference and the velocity gradient divided by centerline velocity. These models depend on the local velocity gradient at the propellant surface (or the velocity gradient divided by centerline velocity) only and, unlike other empirical models, are independent of the motor size. It was argued that, since the erosive burning is a local phenomenon occurring near {{the surface of the}} solid propellant, the erosive burning ratio should be independent of the bore diameter if it is correlated with some local flow parameters such as the velocity gradient at the propellant surface. This seems to be true considering the good results obtained by applying these models, which are developed from the small size 5 inch CP <b>tandem</b> <b>motor</b> testing, to CFD simulations of much bigger motors...|$|E

40|$|Gas Technology Institute (GTI), in {{partnership}} with Dennis Tool Company (DTC), has worked to develop an advanced drill bit system {{to be used with}} microhole drilling assemblies. One of the main objectives of this project was to utilize new and existing coiled tubing and slimhole drilling technologies to develop Microhole Technology (MHT) so as to make significant reductions in the cost of E&P down to 5000 feet in wellbores as small as 3. 5 inches in diameter. This new technology was developed to work toward the DOE's goal of enabling domestic shallow oil and gas wells to be drilled inexpensively compared to wells drilled utilizing conventional drilling practices. Overall drilling costs can be lowered by drilling a well as quickly as possible. For this reason, a high drilling rate of penetration is always desired. In general, high drilling rates of penetration (ROP) can be achieved by increasing the weight on bit and increasing the rotary speed of the bit. As the weight on bit is increased, the cutting inserts penetrate deeper into the rock, resulting in a deeper depth of cut. As the depth of cut increases, the amount of torque required to turn the bit also increases. The Counter-Rotating <b>Tandem</b> <b>Motor</b> Drilling System (CRTMDS) was planned to achieve high rate of penetration (ROP) resulting in the reduction of the drilling cost. The system includes two counter-rotating cutter systems to reduce or eliminate the reactive torque the drillpipe or coiled tubing must resist. This would allow the application of maximum weight-on-bit and rotational velocities that a coiled tubing drilling unit is capable of delivering. Several variations of the CRTDMS were designed, manufactured and tested. The original tests failed leading to design modifications. Two versions of the modified system were tested and showed that the concept is both positive and practical; however, the tests showed that for the system to be robust and durable, borehole diameter should be substantially larger than that of slim holes. As a result, the research team decided to complete the project, document the tested designs and seek further support for the concept outside of the DOE...|$|E

25|$|Moskva was a {{diesel-electric}} icebreaker with a {{power plant}} consisting of eight 9-cylinder Wärtsilä-Sulzer 9MH51 single-acting two-stroke diesel engines, each of which was rated at 3,250hp in continuous operation but capable of 10% overload for one hour at a time. The main engines were directly coupled to Siemens direct current (DC) generators that supplied electricity to propulsion motors through an applied Ward Leonard drive system.

5000|$|In a dual-thrust {{solid fuel}} rocket motor, the {{propellant}} mass is composed of two different types (densities) of fuel. In {{the case of a}} <b>tandem</b> dual-thrust <b>motor,</b> the fuel closest to the rocket nozzle burns fast and the fuel further into the motor's body burns slower. This has the effect of giving the rocket a lot of thrust initially, accelerating it rapidly to high speed. When all the fast-burning propellant has burnt, the slow-burning propellant delivers a much lower level of thrust. The first phase of acceleration is called [...] "boost" [...] and the second phase [...] "sustain". Not all dual-thrust motors are in a tandem arrangement but non-tandem motors function much the same; they just have a different physical layout of fuel. For example they might burn from the inside to the outside (core burning), rather than from the end in (end burning).|$|R
40|$|The {{main control}} task in many {{speed-controlled}} drives {{is to eliminate}} or reduce the load speed error caused by the load torque disturbance and reduce oscillations as quickly as possible. This thesis addresses different aspects of identification and control of such resonant elastic systems. In most industrial applications it is not practical to measure the load speed. Instead, we advocate model based control design that optimizes load speed while using motor speed as the feedback signal. For this to be possible one needs a mechanical model {{of the system and}} we suggest finding the mechanical parameters by estimation from experimental data. Hence a method has been developed which finds the mechanical parameters, including backlash, through a series of three dedicated experiments. At first this procedure is developed for the situation of one manipulated input, the motor torque, and one measured output, the motor speed. For drive systems with a very large motor in comparison to the load, it becomes very difficult to estimate all mechanical parameters from motor speed measurements only. An alternative estimation method has been developed for this purpose, using an additional sensor for the shaft torque. One more rather specific control problem is treated in the thesis, namely for drive systems with <b>tandem</b> coupled <b>motors,</b> where control structures have been developed with and without an extra sensor for shaft torque.

40|$|The {{cost-effectiveness}} of {{the implicit}} (procedural) knowledge that supports motor expertise enables surprisingly efficient performance when {{a decision and}} an action must occur in close temporal proximity. The authors argue that if novices learn the motor component of performance implicitly rather than explicitly, then they will also be efficient when they make a decision and execute an action in close temporal proximity. Participants (N = 35) learned a table tennis shot implicitly or explicitly. The authors assessed participants' motor performance and movement kinematics under conditions that required a concurrent low-complexity decision or a concurrent high-complexity decision about where to direct each shot. Performance was disrupted only for participants who learned explicitly when they made high-complexity decisions but not when they made low-complexity decisions. The authors conclude that implicit motor learning encourages cognitively efficient motor control more than does explicit motor learning, which allows performance to remain stable when time constraints call for a complex decision in <b>tandem</b> with a <b>motor</b> action.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} increased resting-state cortico-cortical functional connectivity in untreated Parkinson's disease (PD). We set out to determine whether this connectivity can be modulated by dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) and explore the relationship of therapy-induced changes in connectivity with motor improvement in the relatively early stages of DRT in PD. Whole-head magnetoencephalography was performed in an eyes-closed resting-state condition in 37 patients with levodopa-treated PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1 - 3) both in a practically defined "OFF" and in the "ON" medication state. Data analysis involved calculation of three synchronisation likelihood (SL; a general measure of linear and non-linear temporal correlations between time series) measures which reflect functional coupling within and between ten major cortical areas in five frequency bands. The transition from the "OFF" to the "ON" state led to increases of SL in the 4 - 30 Hz range, most conspicuously with regard to local SL, in <b>tandem</b> with <b>motor</b> improvement. We found a negative correlation between the change in local beta SL and the reduction of parkinsonism after DRT. Patients presenting with relatively large motor responses (41 % or better) actually showed decreases in local beta SL. The present study shows that the already elevated levels of resting-state cortico-cortical functional connectivity in the 4 - 30 Hz range in mild to moderate PD are on average increased even further by DRT. However, a strong motor response appears {{to be associated with}} decreases in local beta-band coupling, which may constitute a risk factor for the development of motor response fluctuations or dyskinesias. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the last}} 50 years, the {{question}} of the cognitive nature of phonological units has followed the rhythm of the persistent debate between auditory and motor theories of speech communication. Though recent advances in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology have largely renewed this debate, a consensus is still out of reach, and the true nature of speech units in the human brain remains elusive. A dimension of importance in this debate is a systemic one: speech units are not isolated, {{they are part of a}} phonological system, and they obey structural principles regarding well-investigated properties as distinctiveness, compositionality, contextual dependencies or systemic regularities. The phonological system itself is also part of a complex network of interaction with low-level biomechanical and sensory-motor systems, with higher-level brain structures regulating cognition, emotion and motivation, and finally with the social structures in which all these systems are embedded. Connecting assumptions or theories about the nature of speech units with a structuralist view about the relationship between phonetic properties and phonological systems has given rise to a number of major breakthroughs in speech science, for instance Lindblom’s bridges between the Variable Adaptive Theory (or its Hyper-Hypo variant) of speech communication (Lindblom, 1990) and the Dispersion Theory of vowel systems (Lindblom, 1986); or Stevens’ Quantal Theory (Stevens, 1972, 1989) addressing both the invariance issue and the search for the origins of distinctiveness and phonetic features; or the <b>tandem</b> between the <b>Motor</b> Theory of Speech Perception (Liberman & Mattingly, 1985) and Articulatory Phonology (Browman & Goldstein, 1992) in the Haskins Labs. This Special Issue is centered around a target paper by Moulin-Frier et al. that aims at relating {{the question of}} the auditory vs. motor vs. perceptuo-motor nature of speech units with simulations of vowel, plosive and syllable systems of human languages emerging from agent interactions, in a computational Bayesian framework. In this context, the papers in the special issue explore further the systemic perspective, studying how various dimensions of physical, cognitive, motivational and interactional systems can inform our understanding of the origins of speech forms...|$|R
