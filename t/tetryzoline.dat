50|$|Prednisolamate, {{also known}} as {{prednisolone}} 21-diethylaminoacetate, is a synthetic corticosteroid. It is or was a component of Etaproctene, which contains lidocaine, prednisolamate hydrochloride, and <b>tetryzoline.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Tetryzoline</b> (INN; {{also known}} as tetrahydrozoline), a {{derivative}} of imidazoline, is found in over-the-counter eye drops and nasal sprays. Other derivatives include naphazoline, oxymetazoline, and xylometazoline.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{use of a}} gingival {{displacement}} cord with a gingival displacement {{substance is}} a common procedure for taking a quality impression of the cervical terminal in teeth for prosthetic purposes. Objective To evaluate whether the mechanical-chemical method with 0. 05 % <b>tetryzoline</b> hydrochloride or 25 % aluminum chloride is capable of reducing crevicular fluid, and displacing a statistically significant larger quantity of gingival tissue vertically, compared with the mechanical method (without chemical substances). Material and method Ten patients were selected, and then No. 000 and 1 Ultrapak cords were randomly positioned on teeth 13, 21 and 23. Group I – cord with no chemical substance; Group II – cords impregnated with <b>tetryzoline</b> hydrochloride and Group III – cords impregnated with aluminum chloride. Using dental stone models, thirty images were captured with a camera coupled to a loupe to analyze the degree of gingival displacement. Crevicular fluid was quantified using a high-precision scale and individualized strips of absorbent paper for each tooth on which gingival displacement was performed. Result There was no statistical difference between the three groups relative {{to the amount of}} vertical gingival displacement (Anova, p= 0. 26). As regards reduction in crevicular fluid, {{there was no difference between}} the test and control groups (Wilcoxon and Friedman, p < 0. 05). Conclusion The use of <b>tetryzoline</b> hydrochloride or aluminum chloride to impregnate the gingival displacement cord did not improve the quantity of vertical gingival displacement and did not reduce the amount of crevicular fluid...|$|E
40|$|Based on the chiral {{separation}} of several basic drugs, dimetindene, <b>tetryzoline,</b> theodrenaline and verapamil, the liquid pre-column capillary electrophoresis (LPC-CE) technique was established. It {{was used to}} determine free concentrations of drug enantiomers in mixed solutions with human serum albumin (HSA). To prevent HSA entering the CE chiral separation zone, the mobility differences between HSA and drugs under a specific pH condition were employed in the LPC. Thus, the detection confusion caused by protein was totally avoided. Further study of binding constants determination and protein binding competitions was carried out. The study proves that the LPC technique could be used for complex media, particularly the matrix of protein coexisting with a variety of drugs...|$|E
