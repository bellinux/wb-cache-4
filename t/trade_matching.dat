40|$|This paper {{shows that}} one of the {{defining}} features of Walrasian equilibrium [...] -law of one price [...] -characterizes equilibrium in a non-Walrasian environment of (1) random <b>trade</b> <b>matching</b> without double coincidence of wants, and (2) strategic, price-setting conduct. Money is modeled as perfectly divisible and there is no constraint on agents' money inventories. In such an environment with discounting, the endogenous heterogeneity of money balances among agents implies differences in marginal valuation of money between distinct pairs of traders, which raises the question whether decentralized trade would typically involve price dispersion. We investigate the limiting case in which agents are patient, {{in the sense that they}} have overtaking-criterion preferences over random expected-utility streams. We show that in this case the ``law of one price'' holds exactly. That is, in a stationary Markov monetary equilibrium, all transactions endogenously must occur at a single price despite the decentralized organization of exchange. The result is in the same spirit as the work of Gale (1986 a, b) on bargaining and competition, although the model differs from Gale's in some significant respects. Prices; Money...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze {{different}} kinds of <b>trade</b> <b>matching</b> algorithms. The matching (or trade allocation) algorithm is an important part of an exchange trading mechanism. We begin with an overview of the matching algorithms currently used at the biggest world derivatives exchanges. Then we analyze the impact of these algorithms on the strategy of a rational trader, and derive implications of the induced trader’s behavior for the overall market efficiency. Our special focus is on the Time Pro-Rata algorithm introduced by Euronext. LIFFE in 2007 for the short-term interest rate futures contracts. Using rigorous mathematical models, we discuss how the optimal trading strategy should look like, and point out a number of unusual properties of this strategy. The obtained results might be interesting not only from the theoretical point of view, but also for a practical trader. Our analysis implies that the Time Pro-Rata algorithm substantially complicates decision making, and, more importantly, induces individually rational trader’s behavior that is inconsistent with the general market efficiency.

40|$|This {{document}} {{provides an}} overview of interactive messaging for Real-Time <b>Trade</b> <b>Matching</b> (RTTM) for the fixed income products of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). Its main purpose is to provide the required detailed input and output specifications for messages that will be used to support the process. In developing these specifications, an effort was made to ensure that they are consistent with existing Interactive Messaging specifications developed by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) to support both government and mortgage-backed securities. This was done to minimize the coding efforts of participants that subscribe to interactive services of several fixed income products and to promote, to the extent possible, standardized messaging conventions. RTTM was designed by FICC and implemented for government securities in the 4 th quarter of 2000 with a vision of using the platform as a model for providing standardized services for other fixed income securities moving forward. Mortgage-backed securities became eligible for RTTM in 2002; Corporate and Municipal securities as well as Unit Investment Trusts (UITs), supported in this specification, are planned for the 4 th quarter of 2003. Concomitant with the expansion of RTTM, FICC has been working to formulate and implement solutions for a number of challenges facing the industry. These include...|$|E
40|$|The {{modern economy}} {{involves}} {{a variety of}} marketplaces, and the Internet {{has led to the}} development of a new efficient marketplace-The one-shot multiattribute exchange. It is an important decision problem for a matchmaker (or broker) to achieve the optimal <b>trade</b> <b>matching</b> in one-shot multiattribute exchanges; however, to the best of our knowledge, there has been little work on this issue under fuzzy environments. This paper proposes an optimal matching approach for one-shot multiattribute exchanges with simultaneous fuzzy information and indivisible demand considerations. First, we employ fuzzy set theory to represent the traders' orders with fuzzy information and then put forward a calculation method of the matching degree based on the improved fuzzy information axiom. Second, on the basis of the matching degree, we construct a fuzzy multiobjective programming model for one-shot multiattribute exchanges with indivisible demand. Afterward, the credibility measure is introduced to convert the model into a crisp one. The crisp model belongs to a class of multiobjective nonlinear general assignment problems and has NP-hard complexity. In order to solve the crisp model effectively, we develop a problem-specified metaheuristic algorithm, i. e., multiobjective discrete differential evolution. Finally, we conduct comprehensive computational experiments on numerical examples to illustrate the application and performance of the proposed model and algorithm.

40|$|In many {{developing}} countries, increasing international integration {{has been accompanied}} by rising wage inequality, and traditional Heckscher-Ohlin models, which rely on between-sector reallocations to link trade and labor-market outcomes, are difficult to reconcile with this pattern (Goldberg and Pavcnik 2007). Recently, researchers have proposed a number of potential within-sector explanations based on the behavior of heterogeneous firms, involving technology choice, quality upgrading, search and bargaining, or fair wages, among other mechanisms. There is evidence at the plant level to support a within-sector link between trade and inequality. For instance, Verhoogen (2008) finds that initially larger, higher-productivity Mexican plants had higher export propensity and wages in cross-section in 1993 and that {{they were more likely to}} increase exports and wages in response to the late- 1994 devaluation of the peso. The shock to exporting thus arguably increased dispersion in wages between plants within sectors. At the plant level, however, many of the proposed within-sector mechanisms carry similar observable implications. Distinguishing among the various mechanisms will require moving to a lower level of disaggregation, and exploiting information at the level of individual workers within plants. In this short article and the longer article to which it is a companion (Frías, Kaplan, and Verhoogen 2011), we use employer-employee data from Mexico and an identification strategy from Verhoogen (2008) to examine the effects of exporting on wage outcomes that are not available in standard plant-level datasets. In Frías, Kaplan, and Verhoogen (2011), we estimate the effect of exporting on wage premia, defined as wages above what individual workers would expect to earn elsewhere in the labor market. Wage premia are estimated as plant effects, controlling flexibly for individual heterogeneity (and allowing the return to worker ability to vary over time), implicitly assuming that the plant effect is the same for all employed workers. In this short article, by contrast, we do not attempt to control for worker heterogeneity, but instead focus on the effect of exporting on the shape of within-plant wage distributions. As we show in more detail below, we find that exporting has little effect on wages at the low end of the wage spectrum within plants, and that it raises within-plant wage dispersion, but not uniformly between all quantiles. The results are consistent with, but add important qualifications to, the finding of Verhoogen (2008) in plant-level data that exporting raised the ratio of white-collar to blue-collar average wages. This article is related to an active theory literature on <b>trade,</b> <b>matching,</b> and organizations which has proposed a variety of mechanisms linking trade and wage distributions within firms. Recent papers using employer-employee data to investigate the consequences of trade for labor-market outcomes (without focusing on the overall within-plant distributions) include Krishna, Poole, and Senses (2011); Hummels et al. (2011); and Davidson et al. (2011); see Frías, Kaplan, and Verhoogen (2011) for a fuller literature review...|$|E
