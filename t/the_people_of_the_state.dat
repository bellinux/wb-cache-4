5|$|An ally of Senator Richard Mentor Johnson, who was {{a primary}} voice against the {{practice}} of debt imprisonment, Rowan made a notable speech denouncing the practice on the Senate floor in 1828. A consistent opponent of internal improvements and tariffs, even those that would benefit his own constituents, he voted against a measure allocating federal funds {{for the construction of}} a road connecting the cities of Lexington and Maysville. The vote was ill-received by <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> and Rowan's popularity took a significant hit. When the bill was re-introduced in the next congressional session, Rowan voted for it only after receiving significant pressure from the state legislature to do so. The bill passed in this session, but newly elected president Andrew Jackson vetoed it.|$|E
5|$|This {{movement}} is {{prompted by the}} feeling that pervades {{the citizens of this}} State that in the present emergency the arms and munitions of war in the Arsenal should be {{under the control of the}} State authorities, in order to their security.

5|$|Introducing {{more taxes}} {{proved to be}} hugely unpopular among both Democrats and Republicans, and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> simply did not have that much money to give. Bond issues {{generated}} controversy and were the source of scandals in the administration. All of the old railroad and infrastructure bonds, including the controversial Holford bonds which had already been declared illegal by the Arkansas Supreme Court, were gathered into a funding act and passed by the legislature. Many bonds were issued for roads and railroads that were never built, or were constructed and then torn up and rebuilt in another direction. Some projects even received {{the same amount of}} funding from different bonds, such as embankments built for railroads where roads were funded to be built by a different bond. One of the most controversial bonds involved the purchase of slate for a state penitentiary roof, which was diverted {{for the construction of a}} mansion of a Republican official J.L. Hodges, who eventually served jail time for the incident. Promissory notes, or scrip, were issued to raise money. The money was used for construction projects, and invested in public infrastructure. Article VI, Sec 10 of the new constitution stated that the credit of the state could not be loaned without the consent of the voters, making these promissory notes illegal. Their introduction also caused actual currency to go out of circulation.|$|E

25|$|Robert Hardgrave Jr, {{professor}} of humanities, government and Asian studies, {{suggests that the}} elements contributing to the riots were not majorly instigated by DMK or leftists or even the industrialists, as the Congress government of the state suggested, but were genuine frustrations and discontentment which lay {{beneath the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> While some industrialists funded student movements and the opposition parties (DMK and Swatantara party) helped move it politically, it is well observed that agitation was a spontaneous reaction, which directly reflected the anger of the common people, especially the students.|$|E
25|$|According to {{historian}} Zutshi, in {{the late}} 1940s, most Kashmiri Muslims in Indian Kashmir were still debating {{the value of the}} state's association with India or Pakistan. By the 1950s, she says, the National Conference government's repressive measures and the Indian state's seeming determination to settle the state's accession to India without a reference to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> brought Kashmiri Muslims to extol the virtues of Pakistan and condemn India's high-handedness in its occupation of the territory, and even those who had been in India's favour began to speak in terms of the state's association with Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} these campaigns marked {{a turning point in}} Rangers' history. The U.S. Army could provide only limited and thinly {{stretched}} protection in the enormous territory of Texas. In contrast, the Rangers' effectiveness when dealing with these threats convinced both <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and the political leaders that a well-funded and organized local Ranger force was essential. Such a force could use the deep familiarity with the territory and the proximity with the theater of operations as major advantages in its favor. This option was not pursued {{in the light of the}} emerging national political problems, and the Rangers dissolved until 1874. However, the conviction of their usefulness had become firmly established, and the agency was eventually reconstituted.|$|E
25|$|With no {{constitutional}} amendment done, Annadurai declared 26 January 1965, the 15th Republic Day of India {{and also the}} day the Constitution, which in essence enshrined Hindi as the official language of India, came into practice, as a day of mourning. This move was opposed by the then Chief Minister of Madras State, Bhakthavatchalam, as blasphemous. Hence Annadurai, who by then {{had been trying to}} shake off the secessionist image of his party, declared 24 January as a day of mourning. He also replaced the slogan of the protests to Down with Hindi; Long live the Republic. Nevertheless, violence broke out on 26 January, initially in Madurai which within days spread throughout the state. Robert Hardgrave Jr, professor of humanities, government and Asian studies, suggests that the elements contributing to the riots were not instigated by DMK or Leftists or even the industrialists, as the Congress government of the state suggested, but were genuine frustrations and discontentment which lay beneath the surface of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, {{signed on}} February 2, 1848, by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican {{plenipotentiary}} representatives Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain, ended the war, gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, and established the U.S.–Mexican {{border of the}} Rio Grande. As news of peace negotiations reached the state, new call to arms began to flare among <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> But as the Mexican officials in Chihuahua heard that General Price was heading back to Mexico with a large force comprising several companies of infantry and three companies of cavalry and one division of light artillery from Santa Fe on February 8, 1848, Ángel Trías {{sent a message to}} Sacramento Pass to ask for succession of the area as they understood the war had concluded. General Price, misunderstanding this as a deception by the Mexican forces, continued to advance towards the state capital. On March 16, 1848 Price began negotiations with Ángel Trías, but the Mexican leader responded with an ultimatum to General Price. The American forces engaged with the Mexican forces near Santa Cruz de los Rosales on March 16, 1848. The Battle of Santa Cruz de los Rosales was the last battle of the Mexican–American War and it occurred after the peace treaty was signed. The American forces maintained control over the state capital for three months after the confirmation of the peace treaty. The American presence served to delay the possible succession of the state which had been discussed at the end of 1847, and the state remained under United States occupation until May 22, 1848.|$|E
