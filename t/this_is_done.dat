5|$|Another non-animal {{research}} method is in silico or computer simulation and mathematical modeling {{which seeks to}} investigate and ultimately predict toxicity and drug affects in humans without using animals. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> by investigating test compounds on a molecular level using recent advances in technological capabilities with {{the ultimate goal of}} creating treatments unique to each patient.|$|E
5|$|At {{both state}} and federal realms in Australia, assent is used as the means of {{enforcing}} a referendum that is required. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> by providing {{that it will not}} be lawful to even submit the law for viceregal assent unless and until it has been approved by the required percentage of the voting populace at a referendum.|$|E
5|$|However, random or {{pseudorandom}} hash values may be {{used when}} hashing objects by their identity rather than by their value. For instance, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> using linear probing by the IdentityHashMap class of the Java collections framework.|$|E
5000|$|Park's Classification: <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> in 1976 by Parks et al from UK. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> in the {{era when}} MRI or Endoanal Ultrasound was not there. It {{classified}} the fistula in four grades ...|$|R

5|$|In Iceland, {{assessment}} and evaluation of pupils is conducted internally, and is not standardised between different institutions. Pupils are given regular reports to grade their progress; however {{the way in which}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> varies between schools. For example, a numerical grade could be given, or an oral and written assessment may be given.|$|E
5|$|A soccer kick is {{performed}} when a fighter is standing {{to the side}} or {{in front of an}} opponent on the ground and kicks the grounded opponent's head. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> in a style similar to an association football player kicking a football. Most practitioners aim to use their shins for the point of impact rather than the foot. While soccer kicks are usually delivered to the head, kicks {{to other parts of the}} body in a similar style are also referred to as soccer kicks.|$|E
5|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} {{is one such}} operation. In this operation, one or more arteries {{surrounding}} the heart that have become narrowed are bypassed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> by taking blood vessels harvested from {{another part of the}} body. Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal mammary artery. Because this operation involves the heart tissue, a machine is used so that blood can bypass the heart during the operation.|$|E

5|$|During {{occasional}} closures on the District line, the Piccadilly line provides {{additional services}} to serve destinations on the District line such as Ealing Broadway. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> either by diverting some trains bound for Rayners Lane and Uxbridge, or as a shuttle from Acton Town. Also, Piccadilly line trains may also {{run on the}} District line tracks between Hammersmith and Acton Town to serve the District line stations with no platforms on the Piccadilly line, namely Ravenscourt Park, Stamford Brook, Turnham Green and Chiswick Park.|$|E
5|$|In {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, {{the electrons}} removed from organic molecules {{in areas such}} as the protagon acid cycle are transferred to oxygen and the energy released is used to make ATP. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> in eukaryotes by a series of proteins in the membranes of mitochondria called the electron transport chain. In prokaryotes, these proteins are found in the cell's inner membrane. These proteins use the energy released from passing electrons from reduced molecules like NADH onto oxygen to pump protons across a membrane.|$|E
5|$|Messages now {{allows users}} to send {{handwritten}} notes. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> by turning the device to landscape mode for iPhones (landscape or portrait for iPad users) and then tapping the handwriting squiggle. The Messages app automatically saves recently used notes, {{to make it easier}} to send them again. A handwritten message can be deleted in the same way an app is deleted; by holding down on the message and pressing Delete. The message can also be saved as a picture file.|$|E

5|$|Purified water {{should be}} used for {{watering}} purposes, although 'hard water' is tolerated. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> to minimise the build-up of minerals and chemicals in the soil. Water purity greater than 100p.p.m. of total dissolved solids is often quoted as ideal. A reverse osmosis unit can be used to filter the water or, alternatively, bottled distilled water can be purchased. Watering should be done regularly. However, plants {{should not be allowed to}} sit in water, as this may lead to root rot.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is now {{produced}} commercially {{through the}} electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, {{based on a}} process patented in 1924. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> in a Downs cell in which the NaCl is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700°C. As calcium is less electropositive than sodium, no calcium will be deposited at the cathode. This method is less expensive than the previous Castner process (the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide).|$|E
5|$|The French-American-British (FAB) {{classification}} system divides AML into eight subtypes, M0 through to M7, {{based on the}} type of cell from which the leukemia developed and its degree of maturity. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> by examining the appearance of the malignant cells with light microscopy and/or by using cytogenetics to characterize any underlying chromosomal abnormalities. The subtypes have varying prognoses and responses to therapy. Although the WHO classification (see above) may be more useful, the FAB system is still widely used.|$|E

5|$|The binding and {{inactivation}} {{steps of}} this reaction are investigated by incubating the enzyme with inhibitor and assaying {{the amount of}} activity remaining over time. The activity will be decreased in a time-dependent manner, usually following exponential decay. Fitting these data to a rate equation gives the rate of inactivation at this concentration of inhibitor. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> at several different concentrations of inhibitor. If a reversible EI complex is involved the inactivation rate will be saturable and fitting this curve will give kinact and Ki.|$|E
5|$|The next larger scale, cell biology, {{studies the}} {{structural}} and physiological properties of cells, including their internal behavior, interactions with other cells, {{and with their}} environment. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> on both the microscopic and molecular levels, for unicellular organisms such as bacteria, {{as well as the}} specialized cells of multicellular organisms such as humans. Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.|$|E
5|$|To combine glyphs, rongorongo employs {{consistent}} rules. First, the ‘defining feature’ of a glyph is identified, and {{the rest}} is discarded. Then, this ‘defining feature’ is grafted onto a ‘main body’ glyph which retains most of its original shape (except for the addition of the ‘defining feature’). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> {{in such a way that}} aesthetic unity is maintained. Typically, either one or two ‘defining features’ may be grafted onto a single ‘main body’.|$|E

5|$|Water used in {{the steam}} cycle is taken from the local mains water, {{supplied}} by Northumbrian Water. Up to 300,000 tons of mains water per year is {{used in the}} station, however it has to be cleaned of impurities before use. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> at an on site water treatment plant that uses a process of ion exchange to remove impurities such as silica and control PH levels so as to avoid boiler tube corrosion. This treated water is used to make superheated steam in the coal-fired boilers, that will turn the turbines before being recovered in the condenser and reused.|$|E
5|$|A {{major part}} of modern weather {{forecasting}} is the severe weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> to protect life and property. Some {{of the most commonly}} known of severe weather advisories are the severe thunderstorm and tornado warning, as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch. Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.|$|E
5|$|About 20% of {{children}} on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether. Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or {{after six months of}} being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions. This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.|$|E
