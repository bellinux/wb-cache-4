Malaysia Airlines announced that Flight 370 was assumed lost with no survivors. It notified most of the families in person or via telephone, and some received an SMS (in English and Chinese) informing <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was highly likely that the aircraft had crashed with no survivors.|$|E
5|$|St. Laurent {{tried to}} project an {{image as a}} family man, and to that end often {{addressed}} schoolchildren. As he had in previous elections, he spoke to small groups of children regarding Canadian history or civics. The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope, Ontario. With the children inattentive, some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face, St. Laurent angrily told <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was their loss {{if they did not}} pay attention, as the country would be theirs to worry about far longer than it would be his.|$|E
5|$|The Morris {{family and}} their friend become lost, accidentally finding the HorrorLand theme park. Shortly after parking, their car explodes, but the ticket-taker reassures <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will be taken care of. The children, Lizzy Morris, Luke Morris, and their friend Clay, explore the theme park and get on the rides. After a ride in which Lizzy is locked in a casket {{traveling}} down a river, {{the three of them}} attempt to convince the parents that they all should leave. The parents reveal that they experienced similar problems, so they all decide to confront the Horrors.|$|E

5|$|The Oakwood City Council {{wanted the}} Playhouse as a {{community}} center. Thomas appeared before the council and assured <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would not be damaged, although he could not disclose what he was intending to use it for. When Talbott Realty proved reluctant to sell, the United States Army Corps of Engineers condemned the property, which became Unit IV on 15 February 1944. Remodeling began on 17 March and the Production Group began moving in on 1 June. Three guard houses were added, along with a wire fence. Changes to the site were minimized {{in order to make}} it easier to restore later. Because it was located in a residential area, efforts were also made to minimize noise and other disruptions.|$|E
5|$|Professing {{to be of}} Irish ancestry and a {{supporter}} of Irish independence from Great Britain, Crowley began to espouse support for Germany in their war against Britain. He became involved in New York's pro-German movement, and in January 1915 German spy George Sylvester Viereck employed him as a writer for his propagandist paper, The Fatherland, which was dedicated to keeping the US neutral in the conflict. In later years, detractors denounced Crowley as a traitor to Britain for this action. In reality, Crowley was a double agent, working for the British intelligence services to infiltrate and undermine Germany's operation in New York. Many of his articles in The Fatherland were hyperbolic, for instance comparing Kaiser Wilhelm II to Jesus Christ; in July 1915 he orchestrated a publicity stunt– reported on by The New York Times– in which he declared independence for Ireland {{in front of the}} Statue of Liberty; the real intention was to make the German lobby appear ridiculous {{in the eyes of the}} American public. It has been argued that he encouraged the German Navy to destroy the Lusitania, informing <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would ensure the US stayed out of the war, while in reality hoping that it would bring the US into the war on Britain's side.|$|E
5|$|The {{police are}} upset about Abbott’s death and blame Scully while Doggett reminds them {{that only the}} thing that killed Abbott and the others is to blame. Scully {{explains}} Ariel McKesson died of heart failure and then was burned to cover something up. She realizes that all the victims were people who {{came in contact with}} the body of Ariel McKesson: Abbott investigated the crime, her mother identified the body, the undertaker prepared the body, and Myron Stefaniuk pulled the body from the river. All but Myron Stefaniuk are now dead. Doggett and Scully find Myron and ask him about Ernie Stefaniuk, one of the hunters from 1956, who he reveals disappeared a long time ago. The two eventually track down Ernie Stefaniuk, who tells them that he hid on an island {{in the middle of the}} town's lake with his wife, Ariel, for 44 years. Ernie says that the bat creature kills anyone with Ernie’s scent on them, so he had burned his wife’s body to try and cover up the scent. He informs <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> hunts only at night and Myron is in danger. Doggett goes back to find Myron only to be attacked and badly torn up by the creature at the river.|$|E
50|$|The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages {{corporal}} punishment because the nonphysical discipline techniques work better {{and avoid the}} negative consequences of physical punishment, including: Making children more aggressive or more violent, potentially causing physical harm to them, and teaching <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> acceptable to physically hurt someone you love.|$|R
5000|$|In the play, Dogberry is {{the chief}} of the citizen-police in Messina. He is first seen instructing his constables on their duties. He tells <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> {{perfectly}} fine to sleep on duty, and that if they see a thief, they should not touch him, to avoid becoming defiled by association with crime.|$|R

5|$|Yang expresses {{difficulty}} {{connecting with}} the children on pediatrics, to Robbins' disappointment. Tom becomes frightened when he notices Lexie is not wearing a name tag, so she attacks her and runs away. His mother is subsequently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, for which requires surgery, and Tom falls down the stairs, for which also requires surgery. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) returns to the hospital, and informs Robbins that Yang is just sucking up. The Crawley's are uneasy about agreeing to surgery, but Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) convinces <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is the right thing}} to do. An obstetrics and gynecology resident accidentally cuts off a baby's arm during a caesarian section, but it is healed by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Robbins, and Yang. Stevens assists Shepherd with a five-hour craniotomy, and Karev is fearful that she cannot handle it, although she is ultimately able to complete the surgery. At the conclusion of the episode, human resources sends out an email notifying Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback) and Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul)'s wife Megan (Molly Kidder), that they have been fired.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wise was in {{post-production}} on West Side Story {{when he read}} {{a review}} in Time magazine of author Shirley Jackson's novel, The Haunting of Hill House. Wise read the book and found it frightening; he passed it to screenwriter friend Nelson Gidding, whom he had worked with on the 1958 film I Want to Live!. Gidding did a full story treatment for Wise before proceeding {{to work on the}} adaptation. As Gidding crafted the screenplay, he came to believe that the novel was not a ghost story at all, but rather a compilation of the insane thoughts of the lead character, Eleanor Vance. He theorised that Vance was having a nervous breakdown, envisaging a scenario in which Hill House is the hospital where she is held, Markway is her psychiatrist, the cold, banging, and violence are the results of shock treatment, and the opening and closing of doors reflected the opening and closing of hospital doors. Wise and Gidding traveled to Bennington, Vermont to meet Shirley Jackson who told <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a good idea, but the novel was definitely about the supernatural. Nonetheless, elements of the insanity concept remained in the script, so that the audience was left wondering whether the supernatural events in the film were in Eleanor's mind or whether they were real. It was also during their visit with Jackson that Wise and Gidding chose the title for the film. As {{they did not want to}} keep the book title, they asked Jackson if she had considered an alternative title. She suggested The Haunting, which Wise and Gidding immediately adopted.|$|E

When Kevin visits her, they are both afraid of telling the truth because they know nobody would believe them.|$|E

When Diana gets there, she is telling <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> {{not a good idea to}} undo the spell, since they don't know why Amelia did it in the first place and because they also don't know how to do it. She stops them and Adam is leaving with her.|$|R

They have a positive winning record against all Test nations, and have a win record of over 74% The first All Blacks Test match was played against Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground on 15 August 1903. New Zealand won 22 - 3, with The Sydney Morning Herald saying, 'The present New Zealand team have shown form so far in advance of every fifteen opposed to <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> seems almost impossible for Australia to put a side into the field with any hope of victory...'.|$|E
25|$|In 1924-1925 the Sentinels {{garnered}} {{national attention}} when, {{under the leadership}} of Louis A. Coolidge, they successfully swayed Massachusetts opinion against the Child Labor Act. They persuaded key Massachusetts constituents to oppose the Child Labor Act by convincing <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had Bolshevistic origins, and that it would lead to extreme consequences; e.g. denying a teenager of the right to help his widowed mother support his siblings, or even to assist with household and farm chores. The Sentinels also claimed that the proponents of the Child Labor Act wanted to remove children from the influence of their families and the authority of their parents.|$|E

25|$|It {{was a real}} {{shock for}} Bohr...who, at first, {{could not think of}} a solution. For the entire evening he was {{extremely}} agitated, and he continued passing from one scientist to another, seeking to persuade <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could not be the case, {{that it would have been}} the end of physics if Einstein were right; but he couldn't come up with any way to resolve the paradox. I will never forget the image of the two antagonists as they left the club: Einstein, with his tall and commanding figure, who walked tranquilly, with a mildly ironic smile, and Bohr who trotted along beside him, full of excitement...The morning after saw the triumph of Bohr.|$|E
25|$|Poirot meets Sir Joseph {{and offers}} two alternatives: prosecute the {{criminal}} (whom he doesn't name), {{in which case}} he will lose his money, or just {{take the money and}} call the case closed. The greedy Sir Joseph agrees to the latter option and takes Poirot's cheque. The detective turns the conversation round to murder cases and tells a rattled Sir Joseph that he reminds him of a Belgian murderer who poisoned his wife to marry his secretary. Poirot's meaning is quite clear and the shaken man gives Poirot his cheque back, telling him to keep the money. Poirot sends it back to the Misses Carnaby, telling <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the final contribution to their fund before it is wound up. Meanwhile, Lady Hoggin tells her relieved husband that her tonic no longer tastes so bitter.|$|E
25|$|The action {{takes place}} in Jerome's very untidy and {{neglected}} flat. Before the play begins, Jerome has arranged a meeting with wife Corinna and Mervyn Bickerdyke from the Department of Child Wellbeing, to convince <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will be appropriate for Geain {{to stay with him}} for long visits. Geain is also due to come to the meeting. To help to convince them, Jerome plans to hire an actress, Zoe Mill, from an escort agency, to pose as his fiancée. The first act takes place one week before the meeting as he interviews Zoe for the job. Before she arrives, Jerome activates his NAN 300F – a female android (or gynoid) whom he calls Nan. He treats Nan, who was originally designed to look after children, almost like a pet. Much of the play's humour originates from her idiosyncrasies as she collides with the furniture, blurts out unexpected remarks, and performs her tasks incompetently – such as serving a drink with the tumbler upside down.|$|E
