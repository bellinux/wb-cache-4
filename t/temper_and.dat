5|$|Edward had a {{reputation}} for a fierce <b>temper,</b> <b>and</b> he could be intimidating; one story tells of how the Dean of St Paul's, wishing to confront Edward over the high level of taxation in 1295, fell down and died once he was in the King's presence. When Edward of Caernarfon demanded an earldom for his favourite Gaveston, the King erupted in anger and supposedly tore out handfuls of his son's hair. Some of his contemporaries considered Edward frightening, particularly in his early days. The Song of Lewes in 1264 described him as a leopard, an animal regarded as particularly powerful and unpredictable.|$|E

5|$|Her myths emphasise her bad <b>temper</b> <b>and</b> unhappiness, due to {{rejection}} {{by her father}} Shiva and her husband, and the hatred of her stepmother, Chandi (Shiva's wife, identified with Parvati in this context). In the Puranas, sage Kashyapa {{is considered to be}} her father, and not Shiva, although Lord Shiva is a father figure to her. Manasa is depicted as kind to her devotees, but harsh to people who refused to worship her. Denied full godhead by her mixed parentage, Manasa's aim was to fully establish her authority as a goddess and to acquire steadfast human devotees.|$|E

5|$|On 26 January 1786, Zieten {{died in his}} bed in Berlin, a {{remarkable}} age considering his hair-trigger <b>temper</b> <b>and</b> his reputed 74 duels.

The furniture of the Berlin house had to be auctioned after his death, and his widow was only freed from debt by a gift from King Frederick of ten thousand thalers.|$|E

5|$|The Beagle is a {{breed of}} small hound {{that is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the much larger foxhound. The beagle is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting hare. With {{a great sense of}} smell and superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent but single-minded. It is a popular pet due to its size, good <b>temper,</b> <b>and</b> lack of inherited health problems.|$|E
5|$|At the department, with April {{absent from}} work, Ron asks Andy {{to fill in}} as an {{assistant}} because the anti-government oriented Ron believes Andy will be ineffective. The two bond {{over the course of}} the day, and Andy begins to tell Ron about his problems with April, for whom he still harbors romantic feelings. Although initially not wishing to get involved, Ron reluctantly tells Andy she is at the hospital and he should visit her. Meanwhile, Ann remains pleasant throughout her nursing shift despite April's constant abuse. The second her shift ends, however, Ann immediately loses her <b>temper</b> <b>and</b> curses at April. Ann apologizes for kissing Andy, but insists it was a mistake and that April should stop taking it out on Andy. Later, Andy visits April, who pretends to be asleep but smiles, revealing she is happy he came.|$|E
5|$|Braham's {{return to}} Britain {{was not a}} welcome one. His family found him {{exceptionally}} difficult to live with. His short <b>temper</b> <b>and</b> aggressiveness manifested themselves when journalists came to the family's home in Leicestershire searching for a war-story to print. Braham, who despised publicity, physically ejected them from his property. His decision to shut the media {{out of his life}} likely explains why, even {{as one of the most}} successful aces, he was virtually unknown in Britain outside the RAF. Braham had also become despondent about the political climate in a country that reduced Winston Churchill to Leader of the Opposition, where the black market was rife and rationing was set to become an indefinite feature of post-war Britain into the 1950s.|$|E

He gets lost and falls off a high cliff, landing on a small ledge. Lad finds him there, but has to jump down to the ledge to save the boy from a bobcat. Now trapped with the boy, Lad keeps him warm until a rescue party arrives.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was said}} by chroniclers to be good-looking, red-haired, freckled, {{with a large}} head; he had a short, stocky body and was bow-legged from riding. Often he was scruffily dressed. Not as {{reserved}} as his mother Matilda, nor as charming as his father Geoffrey, Henry was famous for his energy and drive. He was also infamous for his piercing stare, bullying, bursts of <b>temper</b> <b>and,</b> on occasion, his sullen refusal to speak at all. Some of these outbursts, however, may have been theatrical and for effect. Henry {{was said to have}} understood a wide range of languages, including English, but spoke only Latin and French. In his youth Henry enjoyed warfare, hunting and other adventurous pursuits; {{as the years went by}} he put increasing energy into judicial and administrative affairs and became more cautious, but throughout his life he was energetic and frequently impulsive.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{fulfilled}} {{his promise}} to Canadiens' fans as he led Montreal to a Stanley Cup championship in 1955–56. The season began {{with the arrival of}} his young brother Henri to the Canadiens roster. It also marked the return of his former Punch line teammate, Toe Blake, as head coach. Along with general manager Frank Selke, Blake worked with Richard on moderating his <b>temper</b> <b>and</b> responding to the provocation of his opponents by scoring goals rather than engaging in fisticuffs. Richard finished the season with 38 goals and 71 points, second on the team in both respects to Jean Béliveau's 47 goals and 88 points. Richard added 14 points in 10 playoff games as Montreal defeated Detroit to claim the Stanley Cup. He scored the second and ultimately Cup-clinching goal in the fifth and final game, a 3–1 victory.|$|E

He spends his time with many fellow attendees, some of which live in the nearby dormitory, and enjoys helping them with any problems they may have. His childhood friend Mariya Mikado attends the school with him, and helps in his female transition. She has a spirited personality {{with a bit of}} a <b>temper,</b> <b>and</b> has been a support for Mizuho in the past. Mizuho meets a classmate named Shion Jujo who has a silent voice and demeanor; she quickly figures out that Mizuho is actually a boy, but tells no one. The previous year, she had to be hospitalized soon after she was elected as the Elder due to an illness.|$|E
5|$|A {{short while}} {{later at the}} Andronikov Monastery, a {{messenger}} arrives from Moscow to ask Andrei for his assistance in decorating the Annunciation Cathedral with Theophanes the Greek. Both Daniil and Kirill are agitated by the recognition that Andrei receives. Daniil refuses to accompany Andrei and reproaches him for accepting Theophanes’ offer without considering his fellows, but soon repents of his <b>temper</b> <b>and</b> tearfully wishes Andrei well when the younger monk comes {{to say goodbye to}} his friend. Kirill is jealous of Andrei and in a fit of anger, decides to leave the monastery for the secular world, throwing accusations of greed in the face of his fellow monks, who also dismiss him. Kirill stumbles out of the monastery into the snowy countryside and is pursued by his dog, but Kirill savagely beats it with his walking stick and leaves it for dead. Andrei leaves for Moscow with his young apprentice Foma (Mikhail Kononov). Foma is another creative character, representing the light-hearted and practical-minded commercial artist. Still he seems to be contemplative enough to get along with Andrei.|$|E
5|$|During the {{criminal}} trial, {{all the major}} figures in the case were called on to give evidence. Le Gris and Carrouges began proceedings and were followed by a heavily pregnant Marguerite {{and at least one}} of her maidservants as well as Adam Louvel. As people of low birth, Louvel and the servants were all subject to torture to test the veracity of their testimony but none gave evidence against Le Gris and the case continued through the summer and into September without conclusion. Le Gris' case involved several strategies; he attempted to discredit his opponent by telling of Carrouges' infamous <b>temper</b> <b>and</b> describing the case against him as a jealous invention from a man who had threatened to beat his wife if she did not corroborate his accusations. Le Gris then provided alibis for the entire week in question, establishing his whereabouts in testimony backed up by several other squires of the court of Count Pierre. Finally he attempted to demonstrate in court that it was physically impossible for him to have ridden in winter from Argentan to Capomesnil, where the crime supposedly took place, in a single day, a round trip of approximately 50miles (80km).|$|E
