5|$|Almost all reviewers commented {{upon the}} {{timeliness}} of the book's release as {{the magnitude and}} causes {{of the most recent}} financial crisis were becoming apparent. Some reviewers also commented upon the timeliness of her previous books, like her novel in which society is devastated by a genetically engineered virus, Oryx and Crake, which coincided with the SARS outbreak. Playing off this theme Canadian magazine The Walrus, at a fund-raiser gala for its charitable foundation, auctioned a crystal decanter with five predictions written by Atwood sealed inside.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the two major}} hypotheses explaining the relatively higher GDP growth of Northeast, {{when compared to the}} one for the whole country. These hypotheses are that governmental transferences towards the poorest and <b>the</b> <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> minimum wages are responsible for such relative performance. They are formally presented theoretically and a method to test their relative role is developed, relying on county data for the period 2000 to 2006. The results indicate that the Bolsa Familia Program had a higher positive impact in the GDP growth rate of the region than <b>the</b> <b>rises</b> <b>in</b> Minimum wage...|$|R
5|$|By 1954, the Comics Code Authority {{had been}} {{established}} in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by Frederic Wertham, who hypothesized that mass media (especially comic books) was responsible for <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> juvenile delinquency, violence and homosexuality, particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1920s <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> motor traffic had put {{pressure}} on the ferry's capacity. A proposed bridge between Shooter's Hill and East Ham was rejected as it would be too obvious a target for wartime bombings, and a third vessel was introduced instead. Because of the lack of a fixed crossing, the Thames became a psychological barrier for those living in the East End of London, who could only use a limited number of routes to cross the river, including the Woolwich Ferry. The lack of a suitable alternative route was instrumental in creating plans for what eventually became the Dartford Crossing further downstream.|$|E
5|$|Corrective rape is on <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped or gang-raped weekly, as {{estimated}} by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit.

Yet, victims of corrective rape are less likely to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|Ewes {{generally}} reach {{sexual maturity}} at {{six to eight}} months of age, and rams generally at four to six (ram lambs have occasionally been known to impregnate their mothers at two months). Ewes enter into oestrus cycles about every 17 days, which last for approximately 30 hours. In addition to emitting a scent, they indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. The phenomenon of the freemartin, a female bovine that is behaviorally masculine and lacks functioning ovaries, is commonly associated with cattle, but does occur to some extent in sheep. The instance of freemartins in sheep may be increasing in concert with <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> twinning (freemartins {{are the result of}} male-female twin combinations).|$|E
5|$|Historically, Sarawak's {{economy was}} {{stagnant}} during {{the rule of}} previous three white Rajahs.

However, the state economy is less diversified and still heavily dependent upon the export of primary commodities when compared to Malaysia overall. The per capita GDP in Sarawak was lower {{than the national average}} from 1970 to 1990. As of 2016, the urban-rural income gap remained a major problem in Sarawak.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> prices – 14% in the twelve months to September 2008, {{compared with a}} target of 2.5% – the Central Bank of Iceland held interest rates high (15.5%). Such high interest rates, compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom or 4% in the eurozone for example, encouraged overseas investors to hold deposits in Icelandic krónur, leading to monetary inflation: the Icelandic money supply (M3) grew 56.5% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with 5.0% GDP growth. The situation was effectively an economic bubble, with investors overestimating the true value of the króna.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of the Pectinidae family, the Antarctic scallop is a {{suspension}} feeder, extracting its nourishment from the sea water that surrounds it. Bands of cilia on the velum, a curtain-like fold of the mantle, waft particles towards the gills. Oxygen is absorbed by the gills and food particles, mostly microscopic algae, are trapped in mucous and transported to the mouth by cilia. There is a seasonal increase in microscopic ice algae which become available to suspension feeders when the sea ice melts in the summer, and most of the annual growth takes place at this time. Research has shown that this is as a result of <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> sea temperature and not the greater availability of food.|$|E
