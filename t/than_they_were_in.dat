The reduction in cross-border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone. However, although transaction costs were reduced, some studies have shown that risk aversion has increased during the last 40 years in the Eurozone.|$|E
5|$|After {{treating}} the Thessalian families of Peisidice and Canace, the poet {{turned to the}} intermingled Aetolian-Elian lines of Calyce and Perimede. Perimede had earlier in the book borne two sons to the river Achelous, {{one of whom was}} the grandfather of Oeneus, Hippodamas. To Aethlius Calyce bore Endymion, whose son Aetolus was the eponym of Aetolia and the great-grandfather of Demodice and Porthaon, through whom the later Aetolian and Elian genealogies were traced. Somewhere within these families, Eurytus and Cteatus were found in a form more fearsome <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the Iliad: in the Catalogue they were fierce conjoined twins with two heads, four arms and an equal number of legs. Most significant for the epic tradition, however, was the marriage of Demodice's son Thestius and Porthaon's daughter Eurythemiste which produced the daughters Leda, Althaea and Hypermestra, who are introduced in a group Ehoiai at fr. 23a.3–5.|$|E
5|$|However, most 16th-century Europeans did not {{recognize}} that fossils were the remains of living organisms. The etymology of the word fossil comes from the Latin for things having been dug up. As this indicates, the term was applied {{to a wide variety}} of stone and stone-like objects without regard to whether they might have an organic origin. 16th-century writers such as Gesner and Georg Agricola were more interested in classifying such objects by their physical and mystical properties <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> determining the objects' origins. In addition, the natural philosophy of the period encouraged alternative explanations for the origin of fossils. Both the Aristotelian and Neoplatonic schools of philosophy provided support for the idea that stony objects might grow within the earth to resemble living things. Neoplatonic philosophy maintained that there could be affinities between living and non-living objects that could cause one to resemble the other. The Aristotelian school maintained that the seeds of living organisms could enter the ground and generate objects resembling those organisms.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} whether the investment determinants of new SMEs {{differ from those of}} existing SMEs. To do so, we use two samples of Portuguese SMEs: 495 new SMEs and 1350 existing SMEs, and to estimate the results we use the two-step estimation method. The empirical evidence allows us to conclude that cash flow, age, growth opportunities and GNP are of greater importance for stimulating investment <b>in</b> new SMEs <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> existing SMEs; sales are of greater importance in stimulating investment <b>in</b> existing SMEs <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> new SMEs; and debt and interest rate are of greater importance in reducing investment <b>in</b> new SMEs <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> existing SMEs. Also, the persistence of investment over time <b>is</b> greater <b>in</b> new SMEs than it <b>is</b> <b>in</b> existing SMEs. These findings suggest that problems of information asymmetry between SME owners/managers and creditors <b>are</b> particularly important <b>in</b> the context of new SME activity. As guidelines for economic policy, we suggest adding effective support through the creation of beneficial lines of credit designed specifically to support new SME activity.

25|$|Immigrants {{may find}} {{that they are a}} part of a lower {{socioeconomic}} status group in the United States <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> their home country. Immigration research shows that it is rarely the poorest citizens of the sending countries that immigrate to the United States, simply because they cannot afford the associated costs. This is particularly true when they come from countries where the cost of living is not as high as in the United States. Individuals who may have held professional occupations in their country of origin may find themselves in low-paying jobs if their certifications are not recognized by the United States. When families migrate to the United States from a country with a patriarchal society, men in particular may experience a loss of status.|$|E
25|$|Calderón’s forces {{concentrate}} on taking down cartel members {{that have a}} high-ranking in the cartel {{in an attempt to}} take down the whole organization. The resulting struggle to fill the recently vacated position is one that threatens the existence of many lives in the cartel. Typically, many junior-level cartel members then fight amongst one another, creating more and more chaos. The drug cartels are more aggressive and forceful now <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the past and at this point, the cartels hold much of the power in Mexico. Calderón relies heavily on the military to defend and fight against cartel activity. Calderón’s military forces have yet to yield significant results in dealing with the violent cartels {{due in part to the}} fact that many of the law enforcement officials working for the Mexican government are suspected of being corrupt. There is suspicion that cartels have corrupted and infiltrated the military at a high level, influencing many high-ranking generals and officers. Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission has received nearly 5,800 complaints regarding military abuse since the beginning of the drug war in 2006. Additionally, the National Human Rights Commission has completed nearly 90 in-depth reports since 2007, addressing the many human rights violations towards civilians that have occurred while the military officers were actively participating in law enforcement activities.|$|E
