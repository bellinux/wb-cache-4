5|$|A team <b>typically</b> {{consists}} of nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity. However, since {{only the top}} two scores from each category count towards the team's total score, a team can compete with as few as six students without any point deduction. Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally {{it is to the}} students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are <b>typically</b> lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are <b>typically</b> lower than those in Honors.|$|E
5|$|Chips and salsa, <b>typically</b> served using tortilla or corn chips, is {{a common}} type of chips and dip dish that gained {{significant}} popularity in the United States in the late 1980s.

5|$|Lightning Bolt {{are known}} for their guerrilla-style live performances, where they <b>typically</b> play on the ground rather than a stage, with the crowd {{gathered}} around them. The band's sound is <b>typically</b> loud and aggressive, though the group cites composers Philip Glass and Sun Ra as compositional influences.|$|E
5|$|PL is quick: {{relaxation}} <b>typically</b> occurs within 100 picoseconds.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid glands {{are found}} in all adult tetrapods; they vary in their number and position. Mammals <b>typically</b> have four {{parathyroid}} glands, while other types of animals <b>typically</b> have six. The removal of parathyroid glands in animals produces a condition resembling acute poisoning with irregular muscle contractions.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybe semilanceata fruits solitarily or {{in groups}} on rich and acidic soil, <b>typically</b> in grasslands, such as meadows, {{pastures}}, or lawns.

5|$|<b>Typically</b> {{there are}} 3,000 hours of {{sunshine}} each year.|$|E
5|$|Antankarana {{homes are}} <b>typically</b> raised on stilts above ground level. Young men seeking {{to start a}} family <b>typically</b> leave their father's house and build their own from wood and thatch {{gathered}} locally. After marrying a young woman will leave her family's home to move into her husband's house, where she manages the household and assists in planting and harvesting rice.

A young couple <b>typically</b> receives furniture and other essentials as wedding gifts from friends, family and community members. Divorce and remarriage are common in Antankarana society.|$|E
5|$|Commercial pancake {{machines}} are <b>typically</b> {{used in the}} commercial foodservice and hospitality industries.|$|E
5|$|Completely {{analogous}} reactions {{occur for}} the niobium component, but the hexafluoride is <b>typically</b> predominant under {{the conditions of}} the extraction.|$|E
5|$|Crab dip, {{sometimes}} referred to as Maryland crab dip, is a thick, creamy dip that is <b>typically</b> prepared from cream cheese and lump crab meat. Other primary ingredients such as mayonnaise may be used. Various types of crab preparations, species and superfamilies are used, as are a variety of added ingredients. It is <b>typically</b> served hot, although cold versions also exist. Hot versions are <b>typically</b> baked or broiled. It is sometimes served as an appetizer. Accompaniments may include crackers and various breads. Some U.S. restaurants offer crab dip, commercially produced varieties exist, and some stadiums offer it as a part of their concessions.|$|E
5|$|Each vitamin is <b>typically</b> used in {{multiple}} reactions, and therefore most have multiple functions.|$|E
5|$|Fish <b>typically</b> {{have quite}} small brains {{relative}} to body size {{compared with other}} vertebrates, <b>typically</b> one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal. However, some fish have relatively large brains, most notably mormyrids and sharks, which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and marsupials.|$|E

5|$|If the ylide carbon is {{substituted}} with an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), the reagent {{is referred}} to as a stabilized ylide. These, similarly to sulfoxonium reagents, react much slower and are <b>typically</b> easier to prepare. These are limited in their usefulness as the reaction can become prohibitively sluggish: examples involving amides are widespread, with many fewer involving esters and virtually no examples involving other EWG's. For these, the related Darzens reaction is <b>typically</b> more appropriate.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 thirty-one codes {{were planned}} {{to run on}} Titan, <b>typically</b> four or five at any one time.|$|E
5|$|In infants, it <b>typically</b> occurs {{within the}} first 312 months of age.|$|E
5|$|In print, {{the space}} {{used as a}} {{thousands}} separator (commonly called a thin space) is <b>typically</b> narrower than that used between words.|$|E
5|$|Kubrick's films <b>typically</b> involve {{expressions}} of an inner struggle, examined from different perspectives.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} {{of people with}} AD is less. Following diagnosis it <b>typically</b> ranges from three to ten years.|$|E
5|$|Moderate {{to severe}} croup may be {{improved}} temporarily with nebulized epinephrine. While epinephrine <b>typically</b> produces {{a reduction in}} croup severity within 10–30 minutes, the benefits last for only about 2 hours. If the condition remains improved for 2–4hours after treatment and no other complications arise, the child is <b>typically</b> discharged from the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Most other bees, {{including}} familiar insects such as carpenter bees, leafcutter {{bees and}} mason bees are solitary {{in the sense}} that every female is fertile, and <b>typically</b> inhabits a nest she constructs herself. There is no division of labor so these nests lack queens and worker bees for these species. Solitary bees <b>typically</b> produce neither honey nor beeswax.|$|E
5|$|Naem <b>typically</b> has a short shelf life, {{which can}} be {{extended}} through refrigeration. The sausage can be time-consuming and labor-intensive to prepare. In Thailand, it is <b>typically</b> stored at room temperature, which gives it a shelf life of around one week. It is also produced in areas of Southeast Asia near Thailand.|$|E
5|$|On tour, {{the band}} <b>typically</b> {{performed}} a roughly {{two and a}} half-hour set that varied only a little from night to night.|$|E
5|$|Planet Nine {{does not}} have an {{official}} name, and it will not receive one unless its existence is confirmed, <b>typically</b> through optical imaging. Once confirmed, the IAU will certify a name, with priority <b>typically</b> given to a name proposed by its discoverers. It will likely be a name chosen from Roman or Greek mythology.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia {{is often}} {{described}} in terms of positive and negative (or deficit) symptoms. Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience, but are present in people with schizophrenia. They can include delusions, disordered thoughts and speech, and tactile, auditory, visual, olfactory and gustatory hallucinations, <b>typically</b> regarded as manifestations of psychosis. Hallucinations are also <b>typically</b> related to the content of the delusional theme. Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication.|$|E
5|$|Single cross hybrids {{result from}} the cross between two true-breeding organisms which {{produces}} an F1 hybrid (first filial generation). The cross between two different homozygous lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and <b>typically</b> one is dominant and the other recessive. <b>Typically,</b> the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.|$|E
5|$|State {{constitutional}} amendments are <b>typically</b> approved {{first by the}} legislature or special constitutional convention {{and then by the}} voters in a referendum.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms <b>typically</b> begin one {{to three}} days after {{exposure}} and last seven to ten days.|$|E
5|$|Tellurite agar {{is used to}} {{identify}} members of the corynebacterium genus, most <b>typically</b> Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the pathogen responsible for diphtheria.|$|E
5|$|The D± signals used by low, full, {{and high}} speed are carried over a twisted pair (<b>typically,</b> unshielded) to reduce noise and crosstalk. SuperSpeed uses {{separate}} transmit and receive differential pairs, which additionally require shielding (<b>typically,</b> {{shielded twisted pair}} but twinax is also mentioned by the specification). Thus, to support SuperSpeed data transmission, cables contain twice as many wires and are thus larger in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackbuck}} is a diurnal antelope (active mainly {{during the}} day). Three kinds of groups, <b>typically</b> small, are the female, male and bachelor herds. Males often adopt lekking {{as a strategy}} to garner females for mating. While other males are not allowed into these territories, females often visit these places to forage. The male can thus attempt mating with her. Herbivores, blackbuck graze on low grasses, occasionally browsing as well. Females become sexually mature at eight months, but mate no earlier than two years. Males mature later, at one-and-a-half years. Mating takes place throughout the year. Gestation is <b>typically</b> six months long, after which a single calf is born. The lifespan is <b>typically</b> 10 to 15 years.|$|E
