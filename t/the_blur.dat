25|$|If {{the camera}} {{position}} and image framing (i.e., angle of view) have been chosen, {{the only means}} of controlling DOF is the lens aperture. Most DOF formulas imply that any arbitrary DOF can be achieved by using a sufficiently large f-number. Because of diffraction, however, this isn't really true. Once a lens is stopped down to where most aberrations are well corrected, stopping down further will decrease sharpness in the plane of focus. At the DOF limits, however, further stopping down decreases the size of the defocus blur spot, and the overall sharpness may still increase. Eventually, the defocus blur spot becomes negligibly small, and further stopping down serves only to decrease sharpness even at DOF limits (Gibson 1975, 64). There is thus a tradeoff between sharpness in the POF and sharpness at the DOF limits. But the sharpness in the POF is always greater than that at the DOF limits; if <b>the</b> <b>blur</b> at the DOF limits is imperceptible, <b>the</b> <b>blur</b> in the POF is imperceptible as well.|$|E

Thirdly, utilizing the estimated defocus PSF and SNR, {{image restoration}} is performed through Wiener filtering method, in which circulation boundary method is adopted to reduce ringing effect. Experimental results show that the SNR of <b>the</b> <b>blurred</b> image is estimated approximately, and verify the great effect of SNR estimation in blind image restoration. 1...|$|R

25|$|If {{the final}} image is viewed under normal {{conditions}} (e.g., an 8″×10″ image viewed at 10″), it may suffice {{to determine the}} f-number using criteria for minimum required sharpness, {{and there may be}} no practical benefit from further reducing the size of <b>the</b> <b>blur</b> spot. But this may not be true if the final image is viewed under more demanding conditions, e.g., a very large final image viewed at normal distance, or a portion of an image enlarged to normal size (Hansma 1996). Hansma also suggests that the final-image size may not be known when a photograph is taken, and obtaining the maximum practicable sharpness allows the decision to make a large final image to be made at a later time.|$|E
25|$|The {{resolution}} of pit eyes can be greatly improved by incorporating a material {{with a higher}} refractive index to form a lens, which may greatly reduce <b>the</b> <b>blur</b> radius encountered—hence increasing the resolution obtainable. The most basic form, seen in some gastropods and annelids, consists of a lens of one refractive index. A far sharper image can be obtained using materials with a high refractive index, decreasing to the edges; this decreases the focal length and thus allows a sharp image to form on the retina. This also allows a larger aperture for a given sharpness of image, allowing more light to enter the lens; and a flatter lens, reducing spherical aberration. Such an inhomogeneous lens is necessary {{in order for the}} focal length to drop from about 4 times the lens radius, to 2.5 radii.|$|E

30|$|Note {{that our}} {{previously}} reported method [28] {{also includes the}} classification procedures, but its SR approach is different from our approach. This means the method in [28] performs the SR by interpolating new intensities between the intensities of LR images. Thus, the degradation model {{is different from that}} of this paper. Thus, it suffers from some degradation. On the other hand, the proposed method realizes the super-resolution by estimating missing high-frequency components removed by <b>the</b> <b>blurring</b> in <b>the</b> downsampling process. In detail, the proposed method derives the inverse projection of <b>the</b> <b>blurring</b> process by using the nonlinear eigenspaces. Since the estimation of the inverse projection for <b>the</b> <b>blurring</b> process is an ill-posed problem, the proposed method performs the approximation of <b>the</b> <b>blurring</b> process in <b>the</b> low-dimensional subspaces, i.e., the nonlinear eigenspaces, and enables the derivation of its inverse projection.|$|R
40|$|Blind image {{deconvolution}} {{refers to}} the process of determining both an exact image and <b>the</b> <b>blurring</b> function from its inexact image. This thesis presents a solution of the blind image deconvolution problem us- ing polynomial computations. The proposed solution does not require prior knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>blurring</b> function or noise level. Blind image deconvolution is needed in many applications, such as astronomy, re- mote sensing and medical X-ray, where noise is present in the exact image and blurring function. It is shown that the Sylvester resultant matrix enables <b>the</b> <b>blurring</b> function to be calculated using approx- imate greatest common divisor computations, rather than greatest common divisor computations. A developed method for the com- putation of an approximate greatest common divisor of two inexact univariate polynomials is employed here, to identify arbitrary forms of <b>the</b> <b>blurring</b> function. <b>The</b> deblurred image is then calculated by de- convolving <b>the</b> computed <b>blurring</b> function from <b>the</b> degraded image, using polynomial division. Moreover, high performance computing is considered to speed up the calculation performed in the spatial do- main. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is demonstrated by experimental results for the deblurred image and <b>the</b> <b>blurring</b> func- tion, and the results are compared with the state-of-the-art image deblurring algorithm...|$|R
