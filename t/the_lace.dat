5|$|The old {{part of the}} town, Calais proper (known as Calais-Nord), is {{situated}} on an artificial island surrounded by canals and harbours. The modern part of the town, St-Pierre, lies {{to the south and}} south-east. In the centre of the old town is the Place d'Armes, in which stands the Tour du Guet, or watch-tower, a structure built in the 13th century, which was used as a lighthouse until 1848 when a new lighthouse was built by the port. South east of the Place is the church of Notre-Dame, built during the English occupancy of Calais. It is arguably the only church built in the English perpendicular style in all of France. In this church former French President Charles de Gaulle married his wife Yvonne Vendroux. South of the Place and opposite the Parc St Pierre is the Hôtel-de-ville (the town hall), and the belfry from the 16th and early 17th centuries. Today, Calais is visited by more than 10 million annually. Aside from being a key transport hub, Calais is also a notable fishing port and a centre for fish marketing, and some 3,000 people are still employed in <b>the</b> <b>lace</b> industry for which the town is also famed.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> loose <b>lacing</b> {{also allowed}} <b>the</b> armor {{to be cleaned}} and dried out, {{preventing}} the armor from rotting. It also reduced {{the weight of the}} armor by reducing the amount of water and ice retained on <b>the</b> <b>lacing</b> since it would be dried by the air flow. Once <b>the</b> loose <b>lacing</b> was adopted by all ranks, <b>the</b> <b>lacing</b> of <b>the</b> neck protector was then used to indicate rank.|$|R

It also has a five-position pickup selector switch which he installed himself. This battered Strat became his number one guitar by default. He owned a '74 Strat that was stolen shortly after Gish was completed.|$|E

25|$|Most uppers have a mechanism, such as laces, straps with buckles, zippers, elastic, velcro straps, buttons, or snaps, for {{tightening}} the upper on the foot. Uppers with laces {{usually have a}} tongue that helps seal the laced opening and protect the foot from abrasion by the laces. Uppers with laces also have eyelets or hooks {{to make it easier}} to tighten and loosen the laces and to prevent <b>the</b> <b>lace</b> from tearing through the upper material. An aglet is the protective wrapping on the end of <b>the</b> <b>lace.</b>|$|E

25|$|Striped patterns: Lengths of {{monochrome}} and lacework glass were fused {{together to}} create vivid striped designs, a technique that developed from <b>the</b> <b>lace</b> pattern technique during the last decades of the 1st century AD.|$|E
25|$|The stiff {{section at}} each end of the shoelace, which both keeps the twine from {{unraveling}} and also makes it easier to hold <b>the</b> <b>lace</b> and feed it through the eyelets, is called an aglet, also spelled aiglet.|$|E
25|$|The {{regional}} economy was traditionally based on {{industries such as}} coal mining in the Leen Valley and manufacturing. Since {{the invention of the}} knitting frame by local William Lee, the county, in particular Nottingham, became synonymous with <b>the</b> <b>lace</b> industry.|$|E
2500|$|Derby shoe: <b>the</b> <b>laces</b> {{are tied}} to two pieces of leather {{independently}} attached to the vamp; also known as [...] "open lacing" [...] and is a step down in dressiness. If <b>the</b> <b>laces</b> are not independently attached to the vamp, the shoe {{is known as a}} blucher shoe. This name is, in American English, often used about derbys.|$|R

25|$|The vicarage of St Mary's was {{formerly}} at Washington House on High Pavement, {{but with the}} increasing industrialisation of <b>the</b> <b>Lace</b> Market {{at the end of}} the 19th century, the church purchased a new residence opposite the castle gatehouse. This was used as St Mary's Vicarage until Canon Eddie Neale retired in 2003.|$|E

5000|$|Triathletes often lace their {{running shoes}} with elastic shoelaces. This {{allows them to}} pre-set the tension of <b>the</b> <b>laces</b> but then to pull on the shoes without {{stopping}} to tie <b>the</b> <b>laces.</b> This saves {{a few seconds of}} time during the bike-to-run transition. [...] The most popular brands of such laces that are designed specifically for triathlon are Lock Laces, Speedlaces, and Yankz.|$|R

25|$|In 1672 poor {{children}} in Buckinghamshire {{were taught to}} make lace {{as a way to}} make a living. Bucks lace as it became known quickly became very sought after and production boomed as <b>the</b> <b>lace</b> was mainly made by poor women and children. The lace-making industry had died out by Victorian times, however, as new machine-made lace became preferable.|$|E
25|$|The crown-shaped {{canopy hood}} which {{originally}} held {{the canopy of}} the Lincoln bed was recreated, and <b>the</b> <b>lace</b> and silk and wool velvet bed drapes were accurately recreated, including hand-made fringe and tassels based upon 19th-century photographs. New gilded window valances in the Rococo Revival style, perhaps intended to echo the bed canopy crown were created in place of those shown in engravings, drawings and a painting made during Lincoln's presidency.|$|E

This uniform is nearly identical to the road uniform that the Blackhawks currently wear. The main differences between this design and the current road design {{comes in the form}} of <b>the</b> <b>lace</b> up collar, the name/number block font (which is serifed), and the C-Tomahawk logo, which is mostly red, black, and white (with a tad bit of yellow) instead of being mostly red, yellow, green black and white.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{construction}} methods, {{most of the}} structures, underneath the wet-stucco walls, are simple brick masonry. Exceptions were Andrei Burov's medium-sized concrete block panel houses (such as <b>the</b> <b>Lace</b> building, 1939–41) and large buildings like the Seven Sisters which necessitated the use of concrete. The masonry naturally dictated narrow windows, thus leaving a large wall area to be decorated. Fireproof terra cotta finishes were introduced during the early 1950s, though this was rarely used outside of Moscow. Most of the roofing was traditional wooden trusses covered with metallic sheets.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1882, Clara Jessup Moore donated a {{remarkable}} collection of antique furniture, enamels, carved ivory, jewelry, metalwork, glass, ceramics, books, textiles and paintings. The Countess de Brazza's lace collection was acquired in 1894 forming {{the nucleus of}} <b>the</b> <b>lace</b> collection. In 1893 Anna H. Wilstach bequeathed a large painting collection, including many American paintings, and an endowment of {{half a million dollars}} for additional purchases. Works by James Abbott McNeill Whistler and George Inness were purchased within a few years and Henry Ossawa Tanner's The Annunciation was bought in 1899.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, Blake Bevin, a {{self-described}} [...] "science geek", created {{a prototype of}} self-lacing shoes, inspired by Marty's Nike MAG; once the user steps in, a sensor records {{the pressure of the}} foot on the sole and activates two servo motors, which apply tension to <b>the</b> <b>laces,</b> thus tightening <b>the</b> shoe. A touch-activated switch reverses the servos and loosens <b>the</b> <b>laces.</b> Bevin posted DIY instructions on how to recreate <b>the</b> power <b>laces</b> technology on her website. Later, Bevin founded Power Laces, LLC started a Kickstarter project in order to fund the development of commercial version and successfully raised the pledged goal of $25,024.|$|R

50|$|The {{component}} sections may typically include metal beams, {{channel and}} angle sections, with <b>the</b> <b>lacing</b> elements either metal plate strips, or angle sections. <b>The</b> <b>lacing</b> elements are typically attached using either hot rivets or threaded locator bolts.

In some case seismic retrofit modifications replace riveted lacing with plates bolted in place.|$|R
