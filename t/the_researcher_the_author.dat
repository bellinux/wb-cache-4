When {{the aim is to}} know what happened during a criminal event and the motivations for getting involved as offender, interviews should constitute part of various kinds of methodological triangulations in order to generate valid knowledge. This conclusion is illustrated through ethnographic data collected from one juvenile offender in Cape Town, South Africa. The offender, referred to with the pseudonym "Dregan," was first met by the author in 2004 in Pollsmoor prison, where he was incarcerated for a murder he committed when he was 17 years old. When released from prison the first time, Dregan became a part of the author’s PhD research. This involved the author becoming a part of various aspects of Dregan’s life. This included getting to know his friends and family, as well as accompanying him to places he frequented. The interaction also involved interviews, participating in group discussion, completing a questionnaire, and taking pictures with a disposable camera. Through his fieldwork, the author triangulated methods and also actors and contexts. The chapter describes the kinds of triangulation used as well as the kind of perspectives developed of Dregan and the violent situation in which he became involved. The case illustrates the triangulation as a means of validating the data collected, so as to reach the most probable perspectives on the dynamics of Dregan’s violent offending...|$|E

40|$|Das Buch "Entdecken und Erfinden. Lernmedium Computer" basiert auf einem Hochschulprojekt, welches in den Jahren 1997 bis 2000 an der Universität Marburg im Studienzweig Erziehungswissenschaft durchgeführt wurde. In diesem Projekt sollten den Studierenden Möglichkeiten und Anreize geboten werden, mit Neuen Medien zu arbeiten und deren Herausforderungen zu reflektieren und zu diskutieren, sowohl im Hinblick auf das universitäre Lernen als auch für das Alltagsleben, um so eine kritisch-reflexive Medienkompetenz für zukünftige pädagogische Berufsfelder zu erwerben. Dieser Prozess wurde über drei Jahre wissenschaftlich begleitet und evaluiert, indem Befragungen und eine vorwiegend {{qualitative}} Datenanalyse nach der Grounded Theory durchgeführt wurden. Ziel der darüber vorliegenden Studie ist es nicht, aus diesem Datenmaterial allgemeingültige Empfehlungen für Maßnahmen der Bildungsplanung in Universitäten abzuleiten, sondern Anregungen und Orientierungen zu geben für eine Reflexion der Anwendung von Neuen Medien in konkreten Lehr-/Lernsituationen. Lernen mit Neuen Medien wird dabei konsequent aus einer konstruktivistischen Perspektive gesehen, es werden weniger medientechnische als vielmehr psychische, soziale und kulturelle Fragen der Medienanwendung thematisiert, wobei eine Fülle von theoretischen Ansätzen Berücksichtigung findet. Gerade deswegen ist das Buch allen jenen Lesern zu empfehlen, die v. a. als Lehrende oder Studierende die derzeitigen Veränderungen im Bereich des Lernens mit Neuen Medien aktiv und reflektiert mitgestalten wollen. In methodologischer Hinsicht gibt diese Studie auch Anlass, die Frage zu diskutieren, inwieweit in einer qualitativen Datenanalyse Theorien wirklich aus Daten emergieren oder ob nicht auch implizite Theorien durch den Forscher eingebracht werden. Die Autorin vertritt das Prinzip der emergierenden Theorie, die Studie selbst ist allerdings aus der Sicht des Rezensenten eher ein Beweis für das Gegenteil. The book "Discovering and Inventing.

El libro "Descubriendo e Inventando. Las computadoras como medios de aprendizaje" está basado en un proyecto educativo desarrollado en el Departamento de Educación de la Universidad de Marburg, entre 1997 y el 2000. La principal meta de este proyecto fue ofrecer a los estudiantes la posibilidad de emplear nuevos medios y de reflexionar y discutir las oportunidades con éstos, tanto en sus procesos de aprendizaje como en la vida diaria, de modo de desarrollar competencias respecto a éstos nuevos medios en su futuras prácticas pedagógicas. Este proceso ha sido evaluado científicamente durante los siguientes tres años, mediante entrevistas y análisis cualitativo basado en la teoría fundamentada. La intención de los estudios de caso resultantes no es generar teorías generales y prescripciones para la consulta y manejo de las decisiones educativas en la educación superior, sino estimular y orientar la reflexión y teorización sobre el uso de nuevos medios en situaciones específicas de aprendizaje. El aprendizaje con los nuevos medios es considerado, en consecuencia, desde una perspectiva constructivista; el foco está menos en los aspectos técnicos de los medios y más en las cuestiones psicológicas, sociales y culturales relativas al uso de los nuevos medios, abordadas desde distintos enfoques teóricos. Por esta razón el libro puede ser recomendado a todos los lectores, como los maestros y los aprendices, interesados en un manejo activo y reflexivo de los cambios actuales en el aprendizaje con los nuevos medios. Desde una perspectiva metodológica este libro proporciona razones para discutir las cuestiones relativas a si las teorías emergen de los datos en el análisis cualitativo o de si emergen del bagaje tácito de las teorías importadas por el investigador.

40|$|Teachers face many {{competing}} {{responsibilities and}} barriers to protect children, which consequently presents many challenges for pre-service teacher preparation. This thesis outlines {{a research project}} in teacher education, that explores the use and potential of a strengths approach to enhance the area of child-protection education. The broad context of child protection {{and the development of}} a strengths approach were joint catalysts for planning and implementing a strengths-based research project and methodology. The prevalence and negative effects of child abuse on children’s development and teaching practices are well documented, yet there is a conspicuous lack of literature on successful child-protection education strategies. In contrast, the use of a strengths approach in social services yields positive results and this suggests potential for using the approach in education. This thesis explores that potential as a research opportunity examining connections between the strengths approach, teacher preparation and child protection both in literature and practice. The research project charts teacher-education students’ responses to a strengths-based child-protection module that was newly developed for pre-service teachers by <b>the</b> <b>researcher.</b> <b>The</b> <b>author</b> occupied the dual role of teacher and researcher. The thirteen-week module was designed for students to explore issues and perspectives of abuse and safety, learn how to identify their own and children’s strengths and formulate teaching strategies for child protection. Responses from the pre-service teachers, during and after the module, were analysed to elucidate meanings, understandings and implications of this practical application of a strengths approach to education. The research developed and used a strengths approach to methodology. Qualitative data collection techniques of individual interviews, focus groups and electronic research were modified using strengths principles. Modifications were made in order to maximise collaboration and to allow participants to explore, demonstrate and share their own strengths whilst giving responses to key research themes. The data were examined by contextual and thematic analysis. Interpretations were shaped by principles articulated in strengths literature and research in the field of child protection and teacher education. The research findings confirmed the significant practical and moral demands of child-protection education for pre-service teachers, as identified in child-protection education literature. For many participants the dialogue focussed initially around the issues of child abuse and protection as well as their personal needs and feelings when preparing to be teachers. Participants affirmed the need for practical solutions to protect children and saw existing teacher preparation as a barrier to protection. They appeared to welcome and value the opportunity to vision, and explore strengths, resources and strategies as they were presented in the teaching module. The strengths approach studied by the participants appears to have contributed to an increased awareness and confidence in child-protection education both during and after the module. Some participants explained that they used an explicit strengths approach during teaching practice, while others reported that they felt they had used specific elements of the approach more implicitly for a broader range of teaching issues. The participants’ reactions to a strengths approach to child-protection education were multi-layered, positive, critical and pragmatic. For some participants, reactions indicated that the approach influenced or complemented their personal and professional philosophy and together with their knowledge of broader education theory, could have wider use than in child protection. Other participants expressed limitations and the need for adaptations in the use of the approach. Overall, the participants’ reactions appear to support claims that the strengths approach has potential beyond the social-service sector and may be translated from a largely therapeutic context to an educational one. Most participants found that identifying their own strengths was challenging yet confirming. The difficulty expressed by one participant in examining their strengths prompted further investigation of this element of the strengths approach. Post teaching-practice data revealed that participants used solution-focussed strategies, recognised individual strengths and were confident when discussing and planning for complex ethical issues of child protection. Unexpected findings from the research emerged, not from the data collected but from determining the research methodology. In attempting to match research subject and method, surprisingly, the strengths approach also emerged as an enhancement to conducting research. As well as prompting the expected rigorous examination of researcher subjectivity and ethics, strengths principles also influenced the choice and appropriateness of data collection and consequently provided a guide to developing new research adaptations. By drawing on the strengths of existing paradigms, theories and methods, especially those that adhered to strengths principles of social justice and empowerment, a strengths research framework was developed. Although influenced by a multi-layered theoretical foundation, the singular strengths framework was designed to elucidate rich meaning and understanding from the data collected. The single framework provided a consistent reference point for determining methods and guiding analysis. This research indicated that a strengths approach to pre-service child-protection training could provide a positive alternative, or addition, to the single, adjunct child-protection workshop currently offered by most teacher-education courses. The research findings suggest that an extended strengths approach assisted the cohort of pre-service teachers to understand, develop strategies and connect with child-protection issues in their careers. Additionally, the findings suggest that a solutions-based, strengths approach helps to relieve the reported anxiety felt by teachers in dealing with child-protection issues. Rather unexpectedly, using a collaborative, strengths-based research process also provided an opportunity to develop and use new techniques to work with research participants. ...|$|E

40|$|Aim To {{present an}} {{adaptation}} of interpretive interactionism that incorporates and honours feminist values and principles. Background Interpretive interactionism as described by Denzin can be useful when examining interactive processes. It is especially useful when events affect turning points in people 2 ̆ 7 s lives. When issues of power and power imbalances are of interest, a critical poststructural lens may be of use to <b>the</b> <b>researcher.</b> <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> planned to examine the interactions between midwives and women at the 2 ̆ 7 epiphaneal 2 ̆ 7 points of decision making during second-stage labour. It became {{clear that it was}} necessary to honour and thus incorporate feminist principles and values in their methodology. Data sources This paper draws on a recently completed PhD project to demonstrate the application of post-structural feminist interpretive interactionism. Twenty six midwives representing each state and territory across Australia who were representative of every model of midwifery care offered in Australia were interviewed to gauge their experiences of what they believed represented good and poor case examples of decision making during second-stage labour. Review methods <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> critique <b>the</b> philosophical underpinnings of interpretive interactionism, and then modify these to acknowledge and incorporate poststructural and feminist ideologies. Discussion Interpretive interactionism is a useful methodology when the research question is best addressed by examining interactional processes and the meanings people make of them, especially if these occur at turning points in people 2 ̆ 7 s lives. Interpretive interactionism methodology can and should be improved by taking account of issues of power, feminism and post-structural values. Conclusion Post-structural feminist interpretative interactionism has much to offer healthcare researchers who want to develop methodologically robust findings. Implications for practice/research Post-structural feminist interpretive interactionism enables <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> to be more cognisant of the complex social political and historical context of midwifery.

40|$|OVERVIEW. Corporate {{downsizing}} {{has brought}} increasing pressure on R,D&E managers to develop metrics {{with which to}} value the return on R,D&E investments. But "you are what you measure. " Metrics affect research decisions, research efforts, and <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> themselves. <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> summarize <b>the</b> insights they have obtained with respect to R,D&E metrics. These insights {{are based on a}} review of the literature, interviews with 43 representative CEOs, CTOs, and researchers at ten research-intensive organizations, and formal mathematical analyses. The best metrics depend upon the goals of the R,D&E activity as they vary from applied projects to competency-building programs to basic research explorations. For applied projects, market outcome metrics (sales, customer satisfaction, margins, profit) are relevant if they are adjusted via corporate subsidies to account for short-termism, risk aversion, scope, and options thinking. The magnitude of the subsidy should vary by project according to a well-defined formula. For R,D&E programs which match or create core technological competence, outcome metrics must be moderated with "effort " metrics. Too large a weight on market outcomes leads to fals...|$|R
40|$|This paper summarises the {{observations}} and reflections of a content-based (CB) practitioner and a language development (LD) specialist (also <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> and <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of this article) {{on the use}} of content-based instruction (CBI) in a semester-long Graduate Certificate in English as an Additional Language (GCert EAL) Programme at a tertiary institution in New Zealand over a three-year period. Although the theme-based CBI model works well in combination with LD courses within the programme, there is an obvious need for regular attention to formal language features in the CB courses. The contention is that the sociocultural view of genre and the genre approach used in LD courses, in conjunction with student collaborations in the process of task-based learning, can serve as both a theoretical and a practical platform for successfully integrating grammar instruction into CB courses. Besides, creating a strategy for consistent collaborations between the teachers of the two suites of courses will enable the students to feel the positive results of the links within their programme of study...|$|R
40|$|The article {{investigates the}} stratagems {{and their role}} in China's diplomacy. Originated in ancient times and the related {{techniques}} of military and diplomatic struggle, stratagem has not lost its importance and influence on foreign policy and diplomacy of China. Moreover, stratagems have long become an attribute not only of Chinese diplomacy, but also of other states. Despite {{the fact that the}} stratagems were primarily a tool of diplomacy, they take their origin from the martial arts. Usually the stratagem means long waiting of more favorable conditions and achievement of the goals by any means. The basic idea of all stratagems is the postulate of a true warrior who fights and wins without a fight. Such tactics {{can be seen in the}} modern foreign policy of China, which in the last decade try to use the concept of “soft power”, promoting their own interests, without using violent methods. Based on the analysis of Chinese sources, as well as using a wide range of literature, especially the works of <b>the</b> Chinese <b>researchers,</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> shows <b>the</b> characteristic of Chinese strategic thinking tactics “victory without the use of force”, based on the traditional philosophy of Confucianism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Among {{different}} type of illiterate people, the print illiterates suffer most from getting crucial information passed around the society. Many print illiterate people {{are found in the}} developing countries and in many cases they live in the remote areas working as farmers. These people are deprived of the knowledge generated from the latest scientific researches. This research makes some recommendations related to developing user interface especially suitable for the print illiterate people. In this regard, a user interface is developed based on the recommendations from <b>the</b> previous <b>researchers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> find <b>the</b> recommendations insufficient and develop another user interface based on the improvements proposed by <b>the</b> <b>authors.</b> Later both <b>the</b> user interfaces are tested by two different groups of print illiterate people in a remote village in Bangladesh. The test data shows that the proposed improvement contributes significantly to make the user interface more usable to the target population. 13 out of 15 users could complete the assigned task successfully using improved user interface. Whereas only 8 out of 14 users could do the same with the other user interface. Among the successful users, the improved user interface took 26 % less time than that of the other user interface. Finally some recommendations to develop user interface for the functionally illiterate people are made based on the results and observations of this research.
