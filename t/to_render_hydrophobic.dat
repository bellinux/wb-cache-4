The surfaces were found <b>to</b> be <b>rendered</b> <b>hydrophobic</b> with maximum contact angles averaging 54. 5 degrees while, upon withdrawing fluid, {{the edge of the}} saline pool receded to expose dry surface with minimum contact angles averaging 15. 4 degrees. The extracts were found to be surface-active at the liquid-air interface and there was some indication that direct adsorption to solid surfaces was facilitated by calcium ions. It was found that, in all extracts, a continuous layer of saline adjacent to the adsorbed surface would break up spontaneously to expose dry surface when the thickness was reduced to an average of 764 micron, corresponding to several alveolar diameters. This phenomenon is discussed as a possible means of establishing dry patches on the alveolar membrane, especially in the new-born after the fetal alveolar wall has been exposed to the same surfactants in much the same physical form as found in amniotic fluid. Surfactant adsorbed directly to the tissue subphase is suggested as a physical basis for the discontinuity of the aqueous hypophase seen in many electron micrographs of the adult alveolus.

40|$|We {{report a}} simple, solution-based {{technique}} for coating arbitrary surfaces with thin layers of self-assembled copper tetradecanoate (CTD) nanostrips, {{resulting in an}} optically transparent, superhydrophobic coating. The nanostrip-coated surfaces show water contact angles close to 150 ° and roll-off angles as small as 2 °- 3 °. Importantly, CTD retains its hydrophobic nature even after annealing the self-assembled nanostrips at 200 °C, which does not alter the crystal structure but “melts” the surface microstructure. This clearly indicates that the hydrophobicity in CTD {{is likely to be}} intrinsic in nature and not induced by the surface microstructure (as has been suggested earlier). Strong hydrophobicity in CTD over a relatively wide temperature range presumably results from the presence of the long aliphatic (tetradecanoate) chains in its structure.

40|$|Aerogel {{composites}} {{that are}} both nonflammable and hydrophobic {{have been developed for}} use as lightweight thermal- insulation materials for cryogenic systems. Aerogels are well known in the industry for their effectiveness as thermal insulators under cryogenic conditions, but the treatments used heretofore <b>to</b> <b>render</b> them <b>hydrophobic</b> also make them flammable. Nonflammability would make it safer to use aerogel insulation, especially in oxygen-rich environments and on cryogenic systems that contain liquid oxygen. A composite of this type is a silica aerogel reinforced with fibers. In comparison with unreinforced aerogels, the aerogel composite is about ten times as stiff and strong, better able to withstand handling, and more amenable to machining to required shapes. The composite can be made hydrophobic and nonflammable by appropriate design of a sol-gel process used to synthesize the aerogel component. In addition to very low thermal conductivity needed for insulation, aerogel composites of this type have been found to exhibit high resistance to moisture and nonflammability in oxygen-rich atmospheres: Samples floating on water for months gained no weight and showed no signs of deterioration.

40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been performed on the interaction of dithiocarbonates (xanthate) {{with a wide variety}} of substrates. This study the focuses on the interaction of trithiocarbonates (TTC) with pyrite and copper. The mechanism of adsorption of the xanthate is compared to that of the TTC. For the xanthate to adsorb it is necessary for an oxidant to be present, since xanthate adsorbs via charge transfer processes (electrochemical processes). It was found by the use of cyclic voltammetry and contact angle measurements that collector adsorption of the TTC can occur in both oxidising and reducing (thus the absence of an oxidant) conditions. Neither the TTC monomer nor the dimer could be detected on the surface by the use of Raman spectroscopy. The collector species on the surface was the TTC decomposition products namely the thiol or thiolate. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirmed that the TTC can interact under oxidising and reducing conditions. EIS showed that the rate of adsorption of the collector species for anodic currents increases relatively to the rate of adsorption for cathodic currents. Different adsorption mechanisms are realised for the different polarisation conditions. It is postulated that the TTC species serves as an intermediate for the adsorption of the thiol or thiolate on the surface, ultimately <b>rendering</b> the surface <b>hydrophobic.</b> Decomposition tests, performed by employing UV/Vis spectroscopy, indicated that the TTC is very unstable between a pH of 4 and 11. The thiol or thiolate however does not readily adsorb onto the substrates (indicated by the EIS measurements). Microflotation tests confirmed the thiolate’s inability <b>to</b> <b>render</b> pyrite <b>hydrophobic.</b> The microflotation tests also indicated that the TTC became less effective in recovering pyrite after it was left to decompose for a couple of hours.

40|$|Hydrophobic {{surfaces}} {{that are}} robust can have widespread applications in various industries including energy, hydropower, and transportation. In particular, hydrophobic materials promote dropwise condensation, {{which results in}} heat transfer coefficients that can be {{an order of magnitude}} higher than those seen in conventional filmwise condensation. Existing durable materials such as metals and ceramics are generally hydrophilic and require polymeric modifiers <b>to</b> <b>render</b> them <b>hydrophobic,</b> but these modifiers deteriorate in harsh environments. Therefore, robust hydrophobic surfaces have been difficult to realize and their widespread applicability has been limited. In this thesis, the class of ceramics comprising the lanthanide series rare-earth oxides (REOs) is studied for their hydrophobic potential. The unique electronic structure of the rare-earth metal atom inhibits hydrogen bonding with interfacial water molecules resulting in a hydrophobic hydration structure where the surface oxygen atoms are the only hydrogen bonding sites. Despite being inherently hydrophobic, the presence of excess surface oxygen on REOs can lead to increased hydrogen bonding and thereby reduce their hydrophobicity. Using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and wetting measurements, surface stoichiometry and surface relaxations have been shown to impact wetting properties of REOs. Specifically, freshly sputtered ceria is shown to be hydrophilic due to excess surface oxygen (shown to have an O/Ce ratio of ~ 3), which when relaxed in a clean, ultra-high vacuum environment isolated from airborne contaminants reaches close to stoichiometric O/Ce ratio (~ 2. 2) and becomes hydrophobic. Further, airborne hydrocarbon contaminants do not exclusively impact the wetting properties of REOs, and relaxed REOs are intrinsically hydrophobic. This thesis also demonstrates that thin-film coatings (~ 300 nm) of relaxed hydrophobic REOs show sustained dropwise condensation behavior for over 100 hours at accelerated saturated steam conditions without compromising structural integrity or hydrophobicity, and produce a tenfold enhancement in the heat transfer co-efficient (103 ± 5 kW/m 2 K) compared to conventional filmwise condensation (usually < 10 kW/m 2 K). Finally, the political economy of rare-earths has been studied to understand the causes for market failure. A knowledge assessment exercise finds that rare-earth prices greatly depend on the rise of competing technologies and alternative resources, and international trade policies. It is envisioned that robust hydrophobic rare-earth oxide ceramics will have far reaching technological applications, especially in dropwise condensation. by Sami Khan. Thesis: S.
