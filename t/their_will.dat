Shamans often intervene in these situations.|$|E
5|$|According {{to their}} {{eugenics}} policy, the Nazis {{believed that the}} disabled were a burden to society because they needed care and were considered an affront to their notion of a society composed of a perfect race. About 375,000 people were sterilized against <b>their</b> <b>will</b> due to their disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Around 375,000 Belgians {{also served}} in labour {{programs}} within Germany during the war, working in manual jobs in industry or agriculture for the German war effort. Though nearly 180,000 Belgians signed up before conscription began in 1941, most were conscripted after that date {{and worked as}} forced labour against <b>their</b> <b>will.</b>|$|E

5|$|In May 2015, Josh Boone {{was hired}} to direct and write a film {{adaptation}} of The New Mutants comic-book series. Acting as a spin-off to the X-Men films, it is co-written by Knate Gwaltney, Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber with Donner and Kinberg producing. By March 2017, pre-production had officially started. Boone said {{it will be a}} horror film involving the young mutants escaping a facility in which they are being held against <b>their</b> <b>will.</b> Filming commenced in July 2017 in Boston for an April 13, 2018 release.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to prisons, labor camps and transformation facilities, the 610 Office can arbitrarily compel mentally healthy Falun Gong practitioners into psychiatric facilities. In 2002, {{it was estimated}} that approximately 1,000 Falun Gong adherents were being held against <b>their</b> <b>will</b> in mental hospitals, where reports of abuse were common.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatry {{possesses}} {{an inherent}} capacity for abuse that {{is greater than}} {{in other areas of}} medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against <b>their</b> <b>will</b> and insist upon therapy both {{in the interest of the}} detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E

He was the second sitting member of the U.S. House of Representatives to have been assassinated in office, the first being James M. Hinds in 1868. He was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal posthumously in 1983.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong concluded: The {{responsibility}} for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through <b>their</b> <b>will,</b> indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We {{would like to give}} special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.|$|E

5|$|Barkley {{supported}} Franklin D. Roosevelt for the Democratic {{presidential nomination}} in 1932, but facing a re-election bid himself, {{he did not}} announce his support, fearing that his message might not resonate with Kentucky voters. Roosevelt supporters offered Barkley the keynote address and temporary chairmanship of the 1932 Democratic National Convention if he would endorse their candidate. Both opportunities would help Barkley's re-election chances, so he announced his support for Roosevelt on March 22, 1932. In his keynote, Barkley warmly recalled the Wilson administration and denounced {{more than a decade}} of Republican dominance. Applause frequently punctuated the speech, with the longest interruption – a 45-minute near-riot – erupting after Barkley called for a platform plank directing Congress to repeal prohibition. According to Libbey, the remark was not a repudiation of his prohibitionist position but a desire for the people to express <b>their</b> <b>will</b> on repeal. Prohibitionist constituents still supported Barkley because, for most of them, the depression trumped all other concerns.|$|E
5|$|Bounty {{had left}} England in 1787 {{on a mission}} to collect and {{transport}} breadfruit plants from Tahiti to the West Indies. A five-month layover in Tahiti, during which many of the men lived ashore and formed relationships with native Polynesians, proved harmful to discipline. Relations between Bligh and his crew deteriorated after he began handing out increasingly harsh punishments, criticism and abuse, Christian being a particular target. After three weeks back at sea, Christian and others forced Bligh from the ship. Twenty-five men remained on board afterwards, including loyalists held against <b>their</b> <b>will</b> and others for whom there was no room in the launch.|$|E
5|$|By September 1944, Ostojić {{had been}} {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel, and was the Chetnik area commander in eastern Bosnia. In early September 1944, as Mihailović had been removed as Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Force with {{the demise of the}} Purić government-in-exile, Ostojić tried to make contact with Allied forces in Italy, and agreed with Lukačević to issue a proclamation to the people explaining {{that they were going to}} attack the Germans. After 12 September 1944, when King Peter called for all in Yugoslavia to rally around Tito, he and Baćović warned Mihailović that their men were losing <b>their</b> <b>will</b> to fight the Partisans. Concerned that the Russians would hand the Chetniks over to the Partisans, he then contacted the United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS) liaison officer with the Chetniks, Colonel Robert H. McDowell, but was unable to arrange for the Chetniks to be placed under American command.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} during the preparations (May) for the Olympiad, Israel Gelfer (the Chairman of FIDE's Anti-cheating Committee) {{said that the}} issue of anti-cheating became important {{in the last couple of}} years, with the development of telecommunication technologies (mobile phones, watches and even glasses) that have caused a problem which cannot be ignored. Gelfer explained that they are trying to balance between <b>their</b> <b>will</b> to fight against cheaters and at the same time not to create an unhealthy atmosphere in the chess world. The usual electronic scans before and after the game were of course prescribed, while novel procedures included: having a special anti-cheating arbiter (Klaus Deventer) with approximately 15 arbiters under his authority, one of whose charges was to carry out 30–40 checks during the round; and that players MUST inform their Match Arbiter when leaving the playing area.|$|E
5|$|Opponents {{to suicide}} include Christian {{philosophers}} such as Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, Immanuel Kant and, arguably, John Stuart Mill – Mill's {{focus on the}} importance of liberty and autonomy meant that he rejected choices which would prevent a person from making future autonomous decisions. Others view suicide as a legitimate matter of personal choice. Supporters of this position maintain that no one should be forced to suffer against <b>their</b> <b>will,</b> particularly from conditions such as incurable disease, mental illness, and old age, with no possibility of improvement. They reject the belief that suicide is always irrational, arguing instead that it can be a valid last resort for those enduring major pain or trauma. A stronger stance would argue that people should be allowed to autonomously choose to die regardless of whether they are suffering. Notable supporters of this school of thought include Scottish empiricist David Hume and American bioethicist Jacob Appel.|$|E
5|$|The Augustinian theodicy {{supports}} {{the notion of}} original sin. All versions of this theodicy accept the theological implications of the Genesis creation narrative, including the belief that God created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil {{is believed to be}} a just punishment for the fall of man: when Adam and Eve first disobeyed God and were exiled from the Garden of Eden. The free will of humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for moral evil: people commit immoral acts when <b>their</b> <b>will</b> is evil. The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the will of human beings, maintaining that God is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} team envisioned Japanese cities as entities, who require physical agents to execute <b>their</b> <b>will</b> and regulate the activities within them. The concept behind {{the health of}} a city is based on traditional Chinese medicine in which the smooth flow of a body's fluids nourishes its internal organs. The team equates yōkai with qi, humans with water, and agents of the city (karas) with blood. They integrated Celtic mythology into their concept for further symbolisms, treating the city as the male (yang); and , the manifestation of its will as female (yin). In contrast, their theory treats the humans and agents as the children of the city and its will, and classifies them as the reproduction system's five major organs. Following the team's vision, the mikuras (evil yōkai) represent the five elements in this system. This idea forms the basis of the relationship between cities and their inhabitants in the show.|$|E
5|$|When no {{help was}} {{forthcoming}} and {{the armies of}} the combined nations occupied Warsaw, the capital, to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly, no alternative could be chosen save passive submission to <b>their</b> <b>will.</b> Those of the senators who advised against this step were threatened by the Russians, represented by the ambassador, Otto von Stackelberg, who declared that {{in the face of}} refusal the whole of Warsaw would be destroyed by them. Other threats included execution, confiscation of estates, and further increases of partitioned territory; according to Edward Henry Lewinski Corwin, some senators were even arrested by the Russians and exiled to Siberia.|$|E
5|$|While the Polish {{king and}} the Senate of Poland were debating on the course of action, the {{patience}} of foreign powers was running out. Eventually, {{one of the most}} prominent opponents of agreeing to the foreign demands, bishop Adam Stanisław Krasiński, was abducted by Cossacks and transported to Warsaw, where the foreign ambassadors demanded that the King and the Senate call in the Sejm (the entire Polish parliament) to ratify the partition. In another sign of their influence, the next meeting of the Senate saw the senators from the annexed territories denied participation (those denied participation included the bishop of Inflanty, the voivode of Ruthenia and the voivode of Witebsk). When no help was forthcoming and the armies of the combined nations occupied Warsaw to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly, no alternative was available save passive submission to <b>their</b> <b>will.</b> Warsaw was de facto a garrison of the foreign powers, with their forces commanded by the Austrian (or Russian, sources vary) general Abram Romanius (Abraham). On 19 April the Senate agreed to call for the Sejm to convene.|$|E
