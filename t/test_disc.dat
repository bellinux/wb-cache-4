We found that the Touch <b>Test</b> <b>Disc</b> was the best predictor of school performance (R²= 0. 20). Significant correlations were also observed between motor coordination and several indices of cognitive function, such as the total score of the Academic Achievement Test (Spearman’s rho= 0. 536; p<= 0. 001), as well as two WISC-IV sub-tests: block design (R= - 0. 438;p= 0. 003) and cancellation (rho= - 0. 471; p= 0. 001). All the other cognitive variables pointed in the same direction, and even correlated with agility, but did not reach statistical significance. Altogether, the data indicate that visual motor coordination and visual selective attention, but not agility, may influence academic achievement and cognitive function. The results highlight the importance of investigating the correlation between physical skills and different aspects of cognition...|$|E

Methods: Ninety-one consecutive P. aeruginosa isolates were subjected to susceptibility testing by disc-diffusion assay and Vitek 2. Imipenem resistance was determined by three different methods (disc-diffusion, Vitek 2 and E test). Screening for MBL production was done by imipenem-EDTA combined <b>disc</b> <b>test,</b> imipenem-EDTA double-disc synergy test, imipenem-EDTA MBL E <b>test</b> and EDTA <b>disc</b> potentiation using four cephalosporins. Results: Of 63 imipenem resistant isolates, MBL screening {{could be done in}} 56 isolates, of which 48 were MBL positive by combined <b>disc</b> <b>test</b> and 36 by the double <b>disc</b> synergy <b>test.</b> For confirmation of MBL production, MBL E test was done in 30 isolates.

Additionally, natural antioxidants have received significant attention among food professionals and consumers because of their assumed safety and potential therapeutic value. The aim of this work was to assess the antioxidant activities of eight selected commercial essential oils (EOs), together with the evaluation of their antibacterial and anti-quorum sensing properties. Methods: The chemical profiling of the EOs was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis.

40|$|This {{research}} centres on surface initiated damage on back-up rolls whereby rolling contact fatigue cracks can propagate into the rolls potentially reaching the internal stress fields and leading to catastrophic failure and {{has sought to}} establish design criteria for avoiding such failures. The project objectives have been achieved by examining field evidence, determining the loading and tribological conditions at the work roll/back-up roll interface and investigating both theoretically and experimentally the mechanisms involved in rolling contact fatigue in this case. The presented rolling contact, fatigue and fracture mechanics model includes criteria for crack branching either upwards (i. e. relative safety) or downwards (i. e. potentially catastrophic) and the link between these two cases is related, quantitatively, to {{the properties of the}} roll material.

40|$|Summary: An immunofiltration {{technique}} for the semiquantitative assay of {{human chorionic gonadotropin}} (hCG) was applied in two versions, using different antibodies. One anti- hCG subunit was immobilized on a glass microfibre disc {{in the form of}} six radially located bars, and the dry disc was placed on a water-absorbing material in a plastic device. A second antibody labelled with horse radish peroxidase conjugate was used in solution. For the colour reaction a solution with tetramethylbenzidine and hydrogen peroxide was used. The number of blue bars appearing on the <b>test</b> <b>disc</b> depended on concentration range of human chorionic gonadotropin. The technique with the monoclonal antibodies, anti- hCG and anti-ahCG-horse radish per-oxidase conjugate, was specific for intact human chorionic gonadotropin, while the technique with the rabbit antibodies, raised against synthetic fragment 122 - 145 - hCG and hCG-horse radish peroxidase, was useful for both intact human chorionic gonadotropin and its-chain. Cross reactions with human lutropin and thyrotropin were negligible. Haemoglobin, urea and various tested drugs did not affect the assay. In the assay of human chorionic gonadotropin in the urine of pregnant women and in sera of patients with trophoblastic diseases, the results from the immunofiltration technique were in accordance with data obtained by classical ELISA and by two commercial kits.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to modify a FIFA rotational traction test device to provide the full torque-angle time history and to use the modified device to compare the behaviour of five different football and rugby studs. A strain-gauge sensor and rotational sensor were incorporated to provide continuous measurement of the torque resistance and rotational angle throughout the rotation of the <b>test</b> <b>disc.</b> Data was collected on a standard laboratory made (3 G) {{artificial turf}} surface. From the torque-angle plot, an initial high stiffness region followed by a lower stiffness region was identified and comparisons made between studs. In general, as stud length increased, the stiffness increased in both regions. Furthermore, as the stud length increased for both football and rugby studs there was a pattern of increasing peak torque but no clear trend for the peak angle. The actual foot rotation measured in subject testing is observed in general to be much smaller than the angular rotation required to produce the peak torque resistance from the mechanical testing, suggesting that the initial stiffness resistance behaviour may be a better indicator of the mechanisms involved in the traction mobilised by subjects...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, an FE {{detailed}} study of a gas turbine <b>test</b> <b>disc,</b> subjected to similar conditions as in the rim-spinning test, is presented. Finite element analysis were derived from a plain disc (without cracks) and for a geometry with two types of cracks, both at the notch root of the blade insert and located {{in the corner and}} in the centre (central crack). A crack aspect ratio of (a/c) = 1 was assumed. Fracture mechanics parameters, J integral and K were used in the assessment, and these were computed with the linear elastic and elastic plastic finite element method. Using a crack propagation program with appropriate fatigue creep crack growth rate data, previously obtained in specimens for the nickel base superalloy IN 718 at 600 ºC, fatigue life predictions were made. The predicted life results were checked against experimental data obtained in real test discs, and very good agreement was found. The FE method, based on experimental fatigue data obtained in small laboratory specimens, have shown a great potential for development, and may be able to reduce the enormous costs involved in the testing of real size components and replace tests made in test components.

The duration of mucoadhesion of HPMC containing discs were not greatly affected by the pH values above 2. 2. However, at a pH value of 2. 2 all of the investigated polymers showed the lowest duration of mucoadhesion. Finally, prehydration of discs containing HPMC, CMC or their combination before their placement on the mucosal surface resulted in a significant reduction in their duration of mucoadhesion.
