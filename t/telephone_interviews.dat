25|$|Voter {{demographic}} data for 2016 {{were collected by}} Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, CBS News, MSNBC, CNN, Fox News and the Associated Press. The voter survey is based on questionnaires completed by 24,537 voters leaving 350 voting places throughout the United States on Election Day, in addition to 4,398 <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> with early and absentee voters. Trump's crucial victories in the Midwest were aided {{in large part by}} his strong margins among non-college whites – while Obama lost those voters by a margin of 10 points in 2012, Clinton lost this group by 20 percent. The election also represented the first time that Republicans performed better among lower-income whites than among affluent white voters. To some analysts' surprise, Trump narrowed Clinton's margin compared to Obama by 7 points among blacks and African-Americans, 8 points among Latinos, and 11 points among Asian-Americans. Meanwhile, Trump increased his lead with non-Hispanic white voters through 1 percent over Mitt Romney's performance, and American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders shifted their support towards the Republican candidate using the same relative amount. Additionally, although 74 percent of Muslim voters supported Clinton, Trump nearly doubled his support there compared to Mitt Romney, according to the New York Times exit poll. However, exit polls are believed to have overstated sectors of the electorate oftentimes in the past, and further study with additional data is generally recommended by experts, as it {{is considered to be a}} more accurate representation of voting behavior in presidential elections.|$|E

500|$|On 20 July 2006, Kilgour and Matas {{presented}} {{the findings of}} their two-month investigation as Report into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China. The report presented 33 strands of circumstantial evidence that Kilgour and Matas felt, {{in the absence of}} any disproof, cumulatively allowed the conclusion that [...] "the government of China and its agencies in numerous parts of the country, in particular hospitals but also detention centres and 'people's courts', since 1999 have put to death a large but unknown number of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience. Their vital organs, including kidneys, livers, corneas and hearts, were seized involuntarily for sale at high prices, sometimes to foreigners, who normally face long waits for voluntary donations of such organs in their home countries.”. [...] The report called attention to the extremely short wait times for organs in China—one to two weeks for a liver compared with 32.5 months in Canada—noting that this was indicative of organs being procured on demand. It also tracked a significant increase in the number of annual organ transplants in China beginning in 1999, corresponding with the onset of the persecution of Falun Gong. Despite very low levels of voluntary organ donation, China performs the second-highest number of transplants per year. Kilgour and Matas also presented material from Chinese transplant center web sites advertising the immediate availability of organs from living donors, and transcripts of <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> in which hospitals told prospective transplant recipients that they could obtain Falun Gong organs. The authors qualified their findings by noting the difficulties in verifying the alleged crimes, such as: [...] independent bodies were not allowed to investigate conditions in China, eyewitness evidence was difficult to obtain, official information about organ transplantation was often withheld, and Kilgour and Matas themselves were denied visas to go to China to investigate.|$|E

500|$|In {{an effort}} speculated to implore {{the media to}} view the {{campaign}} more seriously, Trump rolled out a tax proposal that {{became the subject of}} attention. [...] In a series of <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> in early November, Trump proposed a one-time 14.25 percent [...] "net worth tax" [...] that would apply to individuals and trusts with assets greater than $10 million. [...] The plan was meant to raise $5.7 trillion in revenue to wipe out the national debt, estimated at the time to be $5.66 trillion. [...] The plan exempted one's homestead from the calculation. [...] Trump estimated that the tax would only apply to one percent of the population and that the remaining 99 percent would receive a federal income tax cut as well as an elimination of the estate tax. [...] He projected a 35 to 40 percent increase in economic activity as a result and eliminate $200 billion in federal interest payments, half of which would be used to fund middle class tax cuts and the rest to allocate for Social Security. The original plan provided only one year for taxpayers to pay the new tax, but that was later increased to 10 years. [...] Economists predicted that enactment of the plan would [...] "risk capital flight" [...] and [...] "prick" [...] the stock market bubble. Bruce Bartlett of the National Center for Policy Analysis wrote in the Wall Street Journal that the proposed rate would fall short of its goal and that at any rate, would introduce [...] "devastating" [...] disruption to the economic system. Tax attorney Robert L. Sommers, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, argued that many wealthy people lacked sufficient cash on hand to pay the tax and that doing so would lead to the mass liquidation of assets, [...] "roil the stock and real estate markets." [...] Trump defended his plan, rejecting the speculation that it would be [...] "a shock to the system." [...] Roger Stone noted that Trump had been thinking about the plan for a while and that he felt so strong about it {{that he was willing to}} pay $725 million of his own money in taxes under it. [...] CBS News speculated that the plan meant to appeal to middle and lower class Americans. Trump's tax plan differed significantly from the plan put forward by Reform Party rival Buchanan, who had called for a 16 percent flat tax on earnings over $35,000.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} mode of data {{collection}} (self-administered questionnaire vs. <b>telephone</b> <b>interview)</b> on the emergence of response effects and the accuracy of recall from memory was explored in a cross-cultural experiment, conducted in the U. S. and the Federal Republic of Germany. As predicted {{on the basis of}} psychological considerations, question order effects were obtained under <b>telephone</b> <b>interview</b> conditions but not under self-administered conditions, where question order is eliminated by the opportunity to browse back and forth through the questionnaire. On the other hand, the impact of the content of related questions was more pronounced under self-administered than under <b>telephone</b> <b>interview</b> conditions, independent of the order in which they were presented. This reflects respondents' differential opportunity to elaborate on related questions under both administration modes, as well as the necessity to rely on the content of presumably related questions in determining the meaning of ambiguous questions under self-administered conditions. Finally, respondents' recall of the date of public events was more accurate under self-administered than under <b>telephone</b> <b>interview</b> conditions, reflecting the beneficial effect of having sufficient time to work on the recall task...|$|R
50|$|<b>Telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> {{are often}} {{conducted}} by employers {{in the initial}} interview round of the hiring process, this type of interview allows an employer to screen candidates on the candidates experience, qualifications, and salary expectations pertaining to the position and the company. The telephone interview saves the employers' time and eliminates candidates that are unlikely to meet the company’s expectations. Employers tend to perform <b>telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> as a structured interview. The questions are custom tailored to meet the position in question. With the telephone interview {{there may not be}} direct contact between the employer and employee, however, the expectations are still there. <b>Telephone</b> <b>interviews</b> are scheduled and questions are generally prepared in advance, similar to the way other interviews are conducted. Another common reason a company looks to the telephone interview is that these interviews can be conducted on-the-fly. The interviewer does not have to assign company resources to the phone interview. It is a cost-effective method to short-list candidates for the position being interviewed for.|$|E
