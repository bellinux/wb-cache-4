40|$|Knowledge of the {{mechanisms}} of rain-induced shallow landslides can improve the prediction of their occurrence and mitigate subsequent sediment disasters. Here, we examine an artificial slope's subsurface hydrology and propose a new slope stability analysis that includes seepage force and the down-slope <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> shear forces. We measured pore water pressure and volumetric water content immediately prior to a shallow landslide on an artificial sandy slope of 32 °: The direction of the subsurface flow shifted from downward to parallel to the slope in the deepest part of the landslide mass, and this shift coincided with the start of soil displacement. A slope stability analysis that was restricted to individual segments of the landslide mass could not explain the initiation of the landslide; however, inclusion of the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> shear forces from up-slope to down-slope segments improved drastically the predictability. The improved stability analysis revealed that an unstable zone expanded down-slope {{with an increase in}} soil water content, showing that the down-slope soil initially supported the unstable up-slope soil; destabilization of this down-slope soil was the eventual trigger of total slope collapse. Initially, the effect of apparent soil cohesion was the most important factor promoting slope stability, but seepage force became the most important factor promoting slope instability closer to the landslide occurrence. These findings indicate that seepage forces, controlled by changes in direction and magnitude of saturated and unsaturated subsurface flows, may be the main cause of shallow landslides in sandy slopes...|$|E

In some iron based pnictide superconductors the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity has been clearly demonstrated.

This charge sensitivity of the molecular spin is a strong correlation effect due to the Nagaoka mechanism.

40|$|This study quantifies the {{possible}} consequences to stakeholders of reforms to the excise tax on reversions of excess pension assets. Under the U. S.

This analysis shows that a more moderate excise tax rate together with a reasonable funding threshold for asset reversions would not only enable sponsors to spend the excess funds on other corporate needs, thereby lowering the cost of sponsorship of defined benefit plans, but also would open a considerable revenue source for the government, with only a small increase in bankruptcy cost for the PBGC. Plan participants could also gain in an alternative reform, which would require a partial <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> assets to them along with a still-lower reversion tax rate.

The latter were represented by set-ups placed inside hydrophobic graphene slabs at the nanometric scale allocating a few water layers, namely one or two in the narrowest case. Water–proton and carbon–proton forces were modelled with a Multi-State Empirical Valence Bond method. As a general trend, a competition between the effects of confinement and temperature is observed on the local hydrogen-bonded structures around the lone proton and, consequently, on the mean force exerted by its environment on the water molecule carrying the proton. Free energy barriers estimated from the computed potentials of mean force tend to rise with the combined effect of increasing temperatures and the packing effect due to a larger extent of hydrophobic confinement. The main reason observed for such enhancement of the free energy barriers was the breaking of the second coordination shell around the lone proton. Postprint (author's final draft...|$|R

In both cases, the initial electron-transfer step is localized {{on the metal}} centers, but subsequent structural rearrangement results in <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>excess</b> charge to the μ-O 2 unit, with concomitant regeneration of the Mn 2 IV/IV core. Two-electron reduction results in population of the O-O σ* orbital and complete cleavage of the O-O bond, whereas two-electron oxidation depopulates the O-O π* orbital, forming molecular oxygen. The coupling between the metal centers (antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic) affects {{the stability of the}} intermediate species, in which the redox process is metal based, and hence influences the kinetic barrier to bond formation or cleavage. Reductive cleavage of the O-O σ bond is favored when the metal centers are antiferromagnetically coupled, whereas oxidative formation of the π component of the O-O bond is favored by ferromagnetic coupling.

40|$|Sample {{preparation}} for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) of DNA {{is critical for}} obtaining high quality mass spectra. Sample impurity, solvent content, substrate surface and environmental conditions (temperature and humidity) all affect the rate of matrix–analyte co-crystallization. As a result, laser fluence threshold for desorption/ionization varies from spot to spot. When using 3 -hydroxypicolinic acid (3 -HPA) as the matrix, laser fluence higher than the threshold value reduces mass resolution in time-of-flight (TOF) MS as the excess energy transferred to DNA causes metastable decay. This can be overcome by either searching for ‘hot’ spots or adjusting the laser fluence. However, both solutions may require {{a significant amount of}} operator manipulation and are not ideal for automatic measurements. We have added various sugars for crystallization with the matrix to minimize the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> laser energy to DNA molecules.

40|$|The {{time and}} {{frequency}} resolved optical response of wild-type {{green fluorescent protein}} (wt-GFP) has been measured at room temperature following 30 fs, 400 nm photo-excitation. In the wavelength range covering the stationary fluorescence spectrum of the protein, the stimulated emission rises on a time scale of roughly 20 ps due to excited-state proton-transfer (ESPT). The rise can be described phenomenologically by a sum of two exponentials. A long-time isosbestic behavior on the blue edge of the stationary emission implies a barrier for ESPT which is significantly larger than thermal excitations. In addition, an instantaneous component to the stimulated emission appears within the time resolution of our experiment. This observation is indicative of nonvertical cross-well transitions that prepare the proton-transferred configuration of the excited state directly from the equilibrium geometry of the ground-state neutral species during photo-excitation. Finally, transient absorptions around 500 nm and 650 nm can be observed, which are attributed to transitions from different protonated forms of the excited-state of GFP to higher lying electronic configurations, Sn. The entire optical response of GFP is quantitatively simulated using a dynamic model that includes: (i) an energy-dependent rate coefficient for ESPT, (ii) intra- and intermolecular <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> vibrational energy (IVR and VET), and (iii) an additional non-radiative decay pathway for the initially prepared FranckÅ|Condon state leading to internal conversion via motion along a torsional coordinate.

40|$|A {{strategy}} for the National Facility Deactivation Initiative (NFDI) was issued in July 1999. A key element of the strategy is to facilitate the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> contaminated facilities from operating programs to the Environmental Management (EM) Program in accordance with DOE Order 430. 1 A, Life Cycle Asset Management (LCAM) and DOE-STD- 1120 - 09, Integration of Environment, Safety and Health into Facility Disposition Activities. According to the LCAM Order, the operating programs are responsible for placing the surplus facilities in a stable and known condition prior to transfer to EM. The Surplus Facility Program at the Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant has established a process for dispositioning surplus facilities. This paper describes the decision process for surplus facilities with emphasis on the facility walkdown assessments that are {{the cornerstone of the}} process. The facility walkdown assessment process identifies existing conditions and activities required to place facilities into a stable and known condition. The walkdown assessment process captures the facility’s operating history, divides the facility into functional areas and utilizes checklists which address health, safety, fire protection, waste management, environmental, and operational issues. The walkdown assessment establishes the facility’s baseline for the stabilization and deactivation end-point requirements. In effect the walkdown assessment process is the building block for transferring facilities to EM or for Defense Programs to manage non-contaminated facilities which will not be transferred to EM. Another key element of the program is also to realize that throughout the process there needs to be close coordination and communication between DP and EM to facilitate the disposition of excess facilities in a timely and cost effective manner...|$|E
30|$|A {{multitude}} of processes in water engineering involve {{more than one}} random variable. For example, floods are characterized by peak, duration, volume, and inter-arrival time, which are all random in nature. Droughts are described by their severity, duration, inter-arrival time, and areal extent, which are also random. Extreme precipitation events are represented by their intensity, amount, duration, and inter-arrival time, which are all random. Inter-basin water transfer involves <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> water from one basin (say, donor) to a water deficient basin (say, recipient). The transfer involves the volume of water, availability of water in both donor and recipient basins, duration of transfer, rate of transfer, and time interval between water transfers which are all random variables. Water quality entails pollutant load, duration for which the load {{is higher than the}} protection limits, and peak pollutant concentration, which are all random variables. Likewise, erosion in a basin may be characterized by sediment yield, number of erosion events, duration of events, intensity of events, and time interval between two consecutive events. These are all random variables. Flooding in a coastal watershed may be caused by the simultaneous occurrence of high precipitation and high tides where both precipitation and tide are random variables. Examples of processes involving more than one random variable abound in hydrologic, hydraulic, environmental, and water resources engineering. There usually exists some degree of dependence among the random variables or at least among some of the variables. Often we are concerned with multivariate stochastic modeling and risk analysis of the systems and processes that involve the derivation of probability distributions of the random variables considering the dependence structure among them. Nowadays, these stochastic processes can be modeled with the copula–entropy theory that has proven to be more flexible and accurate than the traditional approaches. The objective of this paper therefore is to reflect on some recent advances made in the application of the copula–entropy theory and future challenges.|$|E
40|$|Dolphins and {{whales are}} highly {{specialized}} marine mammals that spend their entire life at sea. One {{of the greatest}} physiological challenges to these marine endotherms is thermoregulation (Irving, 1969; Whittow, 1987). To counterbalance the high thermal conductivity of water, cetaceans have developed thick insulating blubber layers that encase the body. Thermal windows in poorly insulated peripheral areas permit the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>excess</b> heat during periods of high activity or when the ambient water is warm (McGinnis et al., 1972). Integral to the function of these thermal windows is the vascular system, which {{plays an important role}} in the thermoregulatory responses of cetaceans (Fig. 1). For example, whales and dolphins maintain a counter-current arrangement of blood vessels in their flukes, dorsal fins and pectoral fins that provides fine control over the movement of warm blood between the body core and peripheral areas (Scholander and Schevill, 1955). Direct vascular links have also been reported for the dorsal fin and flukes of dolphins and for the temperature-sensitive reproductive organs (Rommel et al., 1994). In addition to its thermoregulatory function, the vascular system of marine mammals plays a major role during the dive response. Marine mammals initiate a suite of physiological changes upon submergence to conserve oxygen and to support prolonged periods of breath-holding (Scholander, 1940; Elsner, 1969; Zapol et al., 1979; Kooyman, 1989). Collectively termed the dive response, these changes include a rapid, dramatic redistribution in blood flow that emphasizes the brain, lungs and heart. Apnea, bradycardia and a reduction in blood flow to peripheral sites (e. g. flippers and fins) are hallmarks of this response. These respiratory and cardiovascular adjustments, while facilitating oxygen conservation during submergence, may compromise the thermoregulatory function of thermal windows located in peripheral sites. Thus, an apparent conflict exists between oxygen conservation and heat dissipation during diving that results from the multiple roles played by the cardiovascular system of marine mammals. To determine the effect of the dive response o...|$|E
