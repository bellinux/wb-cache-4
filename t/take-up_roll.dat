50|$|The {{ink ribbon}} {{was a long}} roll {{the width of the}} print area that was {{positioned}} between the print chain and the paper. The roll came in two parts, the feeder roll and <b>take-up</b> <b>roll.</b> The roll was constantly wound and rewound during printing.|$|E
50|$|To {{place the}} carrier {{quickly in the}} mould, the carrier foil is wound on a coil. The full supply roll is above the mould, and the <b>take-up</b> <b>roll</b> beneath. Usually the foil feeder is {{attached}} to the moving side of the mould, to enable demoulding when opening the mould.|$|E
50|$|Paste {{reservoir}} dispenses {{a measured}} amount of specified resin paste onto a plastic carrier film. This carrier film passes underneath a chopper which cuts the fibers onto the surface. Once these have drifted through {{the depth of}} resin paste, another sheet is added on top which sandwiches the glass. The sheets are compacted and then enter onto a <b>take-up</b> <b>roll,</b> {{which is used to}} store the product whilst it matures. The carrier film is then later removed and the material is cut into charges. Depending on what shape is required determines the shape of the charge and steel die which it is then added to. Heat and pressure act on the charge and once fully cured, this is then removed from the mould as the finished product. Fillers both reduce weight and change the physical properties, typically adding strength. Production challenges include wetting the filler, which could consist of glass microspheres or aligned fibers rather than random chopped fibers; adjusting die temperature and pressure to provide the proper geometry; and adjusting chemistry to end use.|$|E
5000|$|Another major {{categorization}} is {{the type}} of design: is the magazine one chamber or two chambers? If the latter, are the two horizontal or axial to each other? Most 35 mm camera magazines are one large chamber containing both spindles - usually the spindles are close enough together so that the feed and <b>take-up</b> <b>rolls</b> will just miss touching each other when the maximum length of film for that magazine is at its halfway point. Cameras with the single chamber magazine design include all Panavision and Moviecam cameras, most 35 mm Arri cameras, and all older 16 mm Arri cameras. Some old cameras, such as the Mitchell, have two separate chambers horizontal to each other, which looks very similar to a one chamber design. More popular today in two chamber design, however, are two chamber axial magazines, where the feed and <b>take-up</b> <b>rolls</b> (and thus chambers) are [...] "stacked" [...] one atop the other. Cameras with this magazine design in 16 mm include the Aaton and Arri SR models, and in 35 mm include the Arri BL and 535 models.|$|R
50|$|Velvet is woven on {{a special}} loom that weaves two {{thicknesses}} of the material at the same time. The two pieces are then cut apart to create the pile effect, and the two lengths of fabric are wound on separate <b>take-up</b> <b>rolls.</b> This complicated process meant that velvet was expensive to make before industrial power looms became available, and well-made velvet remains a fairly costly fabric. Velvet is difficult to clean because of its pile, but modern dry cleaning methods make cleaning more feasible. Velvet pile is created by warp or vertical yarns and velveteen pile is created by weft or fill yarns.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Take-up</b> <b>roll</b> {{is a key}} {{component}} employed in amorphous ribbon production line. The roll should supply enough adhesion fore {{to take up the}} flying ribbon with a high speed. In this paper, a novel magnetic <b>take-up</b> <b>roll</b> (MTUR) is proposed. Optimize the structure parameters with a finite element method to obtain enough and stable magnetic adhesion force (MAF). The different simulation models are established to calculate the performances of the MTUR. A prototype of the MTUR was manufactured and tested. Experiments prove that the optimal MTUR can generate MAF to overcome the resistant force that amorphous ribbon suffering in take-up process in certain air gap range...|$|E
