500|$|The {{painting}} was purchased in 2006 by the National Portrait Gallery, London, with funds raised through their 150th anniversary gala, {{after more than}} nine months' consideration. The cost was rumoured {{to be more than}} £100,000, though Zarin gives a price of £95,000. The acquisition was criticised by Starkey, who said, [...] "if the National Portrait Gallery has public money to burn, <b>then</b> <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>it</b> ... depends on mere hearsay and tradition, and it is not good enough". Foley countered, [...] "The evidence has been supported by people who know far more about the science of painting than David Starkey.

Club {{suggested}} that the influence of Endtroducing..... {{may have had a}} negative effect on the album itself, saying that it [...] "has been partially diluted by the symphonic beat-collage culture it helped spawn." [...] The album's acclaim set considerably high standards for future releases by DJ Shadow, and he has expressed his dissatisfaction with being expected to [...] "repeat Endtroducing..... over and over again". Despite this, DJ Shadow {{has made it clear that}} he views the album in a positive light and denies any pressure that may have come about as a result of the album's praise: [...] "...people always seem to suggest that there's this pressure, and that Endtroducing..... is some kind of albatross, and I've just honestly never felt that way. I think that I have a healthy enough respect for the lineage of the music and how rare it is that you can connect with an audience. If that will always be 'the record' <b>then</b> <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>it,</b> that's cool." [...] As of April 26, 2005, Endtroducing..... has sold upwards of 290,000 copies in the United States alone.|$|E

Alto Adige is Italian and bilingual, and no one would even dream of trying {{forcibly}} to Italianize these German immigrants. But neither may Germans imagine that they might push Italy back to Salorno and from there to the Lago di Garda. Perhaps the Germans believe that all Italians are like Credaro. If they do, they’re sorely mistaken. In Italy, there are hundreds of thousands of Fascists who would rather lay waste to Alto Adige than to permit the tricolore that flies above the Vetta d’Italia to be lowered.

2500|$|The {{massacre}} [...] "spawned a [...] mass of polemical literature, bubbling with theories, {{prejudices and}} phobias" [...] Many Catholic authors were exultant in their {{praise of the}} king for his bold and decisive action (after regretfully abandoning a policy of meeting Huguenot demands {{as far as he}} could) against the supposed Huguenot coup, whose details were now fleshed out in officially sponsored works, though the larger mob massacres were somewhat deprecated: [...] " [...] must excuse the people's fury moved by a laudable zeal which is difficult to restrain once it has been stirred up". Huguenot works understandably dwelt on the harrowing details of violence, expounded various conspiracy theories that the royal court had long planned the massacres, and often showed extravagant anti-Italian feelings directed at Catherine, Gondi, and other Italians at court. Diplomatic correspondence was readier than published polemics to recognise the unplanned and chaotic nature of the events, which also emerged from several accounts in memoirs published over the following years by witnesses to the events at court, including two dramatic and influential accounts by {{members of the royal family}} that were not recognised as fake until the 19th century, those supposedly by Marguerite of Navarre, and Anjou. Anjou's supposed account was the source of the quotation attributed to Charles IX: [...] "Well <b>then,</b> <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>it!</b> Kill them! But kill them all! Don't leave a single one alive to reproach me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{the point}} of view of today's {{mainstream}} schools of economic thought, government should strive to keep the interconnected macroeconomic aggregates money supply and/or aggregate demand on a stable growth path. When threatened by the forecast of a depression central banks should pour liquidity into the banking system and the government should cut taxes and accelerate spending in order to keep the nominal money stock and total nominal demand from collapsing. At the beginning of the Great Depression most economists believed in Say's law and the self-equilibrating powers of the market and failed to explain the severity of the Depression. Outright leave-it-alone liquidationism was a position mainly held by the Austrian School. The liquidationist position was that a depression is good medicine. The idea was the benefit of a depression was to liquidate failed investments and businesses that have been made obsolete by technological development in order to release factors of production (capital and labor) from unproductive uses so that these could be redeployed in other sectors of the technologically dynamic economy. They argued that even if self-adjustment of the economy took mass bankruptcies, <b>then</b> <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>it.</b> An increasingly common view among economic historians is that the adherence of some Federal Reserve policymakers to the liquidationist thesis led to disastrous consequences. Regarding the policies of President Hoover, economists like Barry Eichengreen and J. Bradford DeLong point out that President Hoover tried to keep the federal budget balanced until 1932, when he lost confidence in his Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon and replaced him. Despite liquidationist expectations, a large proportion of the capital stock was not redeployed but vanished during the first years of the Great Depression. According to a study by Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers, the recession caused a drop of net capital accumulation to pre-1924 levels by 1933. Milton Friedman called the leave-it-alone liquidationism [...] "dangerous nonsense". He wrote: ...|$|E

But even while I pleaded with him to let me finish the wretched business--every savour of adventure and daring and romance gone from it now--I was conscious of the trussed-up monstrosity that confronted him.

60|$|And {{what shall}} that action be? War with Belgium? On them must rest the {{responsibility}} for that.

If Belgium take up the quarrel <b>then</b> <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>it.</b> There are many ways in which we can bring the Congo State to her knees. A blockade of the Congo is one, but it has the objection of the international complications which might ensue. An easier way would be to proclaim this guilty land as an outlaw State. Such a proclamation means that to no British subject does the law of that land apply. If British traders enter it, they shall be stopped at the peril of those who stop them. If British subjects are indicted, they shall be tried in our own Consular Courts. If complications ensue, as is likely, then Boma shall be occupied. This would surely lead to that European Conference which we are supposing to have been denied us.|$|E
