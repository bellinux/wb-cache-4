5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} novels in the series, aspects of Thunderball come from Fleming's own experiences: the visit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> clinic was inspired by his own 1955 trip to the Enton Hall health farm and Bond's medical record, as read out to him by M, is a slightly modified version of Fleming's own. The name of the health farm, Shrublands, was taken {{from that of a}} house owned by the parents of his wife's friend, Peter Quennell. Fleming dedicates a quarter of the novel to the Shrublands setting and the naturalist cure Bond undergoes.|$|E
5|$|British {{buildings}} and organisations now commemorate her by name. One {{of the first}} was the Mary Seacole Centre for Nursing Practice at Thames Valley University, which created the NHS Specialist Library for Ethnicity and Health, a web-based collection of research-based evidence and good practice information relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> needs of minority ethnic groups, and other resources relevant to multi-cultural health care. There is another Mary Seacole Research Centre, this one at De Montfort University in Leicester, and a problem-based learning room at St George's, University of London is named after her. Brunel University in West London houses its School of Health Sciences and Social Care in the Mary Seacole Building. New buildings at the University of Salford and Birmingham City University bear her name, as does part of the new headquarters of the Home Office at 2 Marsham Street. There is a Mary Seacole ward in the Douglas Bader Centre in Roehampton. There are two wards named after Mary Seacole in Whittington Hospital in North London.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is an {{essential}} element needed in large quantities. The Ca2+ ion acts as an electrolyte and is vital <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> of the muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems; is indispensable to the building of bone; and supports synthesis and function of blood cells. For example, it regulates the contraction of muscles, nerve conduction, and the clotting of blood. As a result, intra- and extracellular calcium levels are tightly regulated by the body. Calcium can play this role because the Ca2+ ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds, especially proteins; it also forms compounds {{with a wide range}} of solubilities, enabling the formation of skeletons.|$|E

5|$|Gary Lockwood, as Lt. Commander Gary Mitchell, had {{starred in}} the title role of Roddenberry's earlier series on NBC, The Lieutenant; Sally Kellerman was cast as Dr. Elizabeth Dehner. Both actors needed silver eyes, which were {{produced}} by an expert contact lens fabricator who sandwiched wrinkled tinfoil between two sclera contact lenses which covered the entire eye. These were outdated even in the 1960s and dangerous <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> of the actors' eyes. Although Kellerman could insert and remove the prosthetics easily with no discomfort, Lockwood found them almost impossible to use. He needed to raise his face and sight along his nose in order to see through tiny holes in the foil. He was able to use this to enhance his performance as the mutating Mitchell, the unusual gaze giving him an arrogant and haughty demeanor.|$|E
5|$|Governmental Regulation No. 493/2002 Coll. {{divides the}} listed {{illnesses}} and handicaps into four groups, covering various issues from psychological and psychiatrical to eyesight and hearing (for example, the applicant {{must be able}} to hear casual speech over distance of 6 meters to be cleared for the E category). Generally, the regulation is more permissive {{when it comes to the}} license categories A and B, and more strict with view to the other categories, listing which illnesses and handicaps may curtail or outright prevent positive clearance by the general practitioner. The outcome of the medical examination may be either full clearance, denial, or conditional clearance that lists obligatory health accessories (glasses, hearing aid, etc.) or sets obligatory escort when armed (e.g. B – sport shooters with minor psychological issues, or with addiction habits cured more than three years prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> check).|$|E
5|$|In 1906 a major {{explosion}} at a colliery in Courrières, northern France, caused {{the deaths of}} more than 1,000 miners. The subsequent report blamed the accidental ignition of firedamp, exacerbated by coal dust in the air. Concerned that a similar disaster might happen in British collieries, the Royal Commission was formed, reporting back in 1907, 1909 and 1911. The reports led to the Coal Mines Act 1911, which came into force December that year. Among other changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> and safety culture, the act required that ventilation fans in all collieries be capable of reversing the air current underground; this measure was to be implemented by 1 January 1913.|$|E

5|$|On 9 December 2015, the ORR {{announced}} that WCRC {{and the driver}} of the train were to be prosecuted for offences contrary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Health</b> and Safety at Work Act 1974. An initial hearing was scheduled to be heard at Swindon Magistrates Court on 11 January 2016, but postponed until 20 January. When the case opened, neither the driver Melvyn Cox nor WCRC entered pleas. The case was committed to Swindon Crown Court, where it was scheduled to be heard on 19 February; unconditional bail was granted to Cox. The case was subsequently postponed until 18 March, and then further postponed to an undisclosed date in May 2016. In late May, it was {{announced that}} the trial would begin on 27 June 2016.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies found}} that the {{financial}} crisis and accompanying recession could {{not account for the}} entirety of the slowdown and that structural changes likely share at least partial credit.

Paul Krawzak claimed that even if cost controls succeed in reducing the amount spent on healthcare, such efforts on their own may be insufficient to outweigh the long-term burden placed by demographic changes, particularly the growth of the population on Medicare.|$|E

In the first game in the series, , the vampire Kain embarks on a journey to restore the Pillars of Nosgoth—nine supernatural edifices which are {{inextricably}} tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> of the land, but become corrupted. During his adventure, Moebius, a manipulative sorcerer, tricks Kain into orchestrating {{the destruction of the}} vampire race: Kain is left the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth. After restoring eight of the Pillars, Kain discovers that he would need to sacrifice his own life to restore the final corrupt one. Realizing that his death would ensure the annihilation of his species, he refuses to kill himself. This triggers the Pillars' collapse, and dooms the world to eternal decay, but enables Kain to live on and revive the vampire race.|$|E

5|$|The cabin {{located on}} the main deck {{underneath}} the sterncastle {{is thought to have}} belonged to the barber-surgeon. He was a trained professional who saw <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> and welfare of the crew and acted as the medical expert on board. The most important of these finds were found in an intact wooden chest which contained over 60 objects relating to the barber-surgeon's medical practice: the wooden handles of a complete set of surgical tools and several shaving razors (although none of the steel blades had survived), a copper syringe for wound irrigation and treatment of gonorrhoea, and even a skilfully crafted feeding bottle for feeding incapacitated patients. More objects were found around the cabin, such as earscoops, shaving bowls and combs. With this wide selection of tools and medicaments the barber-surgeon, along with one or more assistants, could set bone fractures, perform amputations and deal with other acute injuries, treat a number of diseases and provide crew members with a minimal standard of personal hygiene.|$|E
