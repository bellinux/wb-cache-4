500|$|The {{birth of}} the Federation was first hinted at during part two of [...] "Shockwave", which opened the second season. When Manny Coto was made show runner for the fourth season, he decided that {{the focus of the}} series should be to link to that event. With this in mind, his {{intention}} was for this season to move towards that goal. Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens were hired as writers on Enterprise because they wrote the non-canon novel Federation and after it was suggested by producer Mike Sussman. The episodes for the fourth season were intended to lay the framework for the later creation of the Federation. This was something that the cast said that they would have liked to see more of, with Scott Bakula later saying [...] "I {{would have loved to have}} been able to explore that journey to the Federation and their creation of it... to a greater extent. And I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been, um, just more fun for the audience... just better, longer storytelling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hagel faced sharp {{questioning}} from Republicans. Senator John McCain berated him {{for refusing}} to give {{a yes or no}} {{answer to the question of}} whether the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 was a success. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina demanded he [...] "name one dumb thing we've been goaded into doing because of the pressure from the Israeli or Jewish lobby." [...] Hagel stated [...] "I've already said I regret referencing the Jewish lobby, I should have said, 'pro-Israel lobby. ... The use of 'intimidation'â€”I should have used 'influence.' I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been more appropriate. I should not have said 'dumb' or 'stupid,' because I understand or appreciate there are other views on these things.". Senator Ted Cruz played video excerpts from a 2009 Al Jazeera interview, and asserted that Hagel had agreed with a caller who suggested that Israel had committed war crimes. Hagel denied he agreed with that view. After the hearing, Senator Cruz organized a letter from 25 Republican Senators saying they would not vote until Hagel gave them copies of speeches given to organizations and told them the amount he was paid and whether the organizations received money from foreign sources. Lindsey Graham said they wanted to know if he spoke for any [...] "anti-Israel" [...] groups. Senate Committee chair Carl Levin said the demands were unprecedented, asking [...] "for information no prior nominee has been asked for," [...] and expressed confidence Hagel would be approved by the Senate.|$|E
6000|$|Hetty met his glance, and Cheyne saw {{the little}} glow in her eyes. [...] "Do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> counted for {{anything}} {{with such a}} man?" ...|$|E
60|$|Meaning, I <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to get {{permission}} of her Voices first.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> anybody <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been {{so utterly}} idiotic as {{to call me}} after a ground-vine--a vegetable?" [...] she {{continued}} petulantly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Father! Father! Impossible! Cruel! Oh--do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{followed}} you hither from Africa, {{against your}} own entreaties, to desert you now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> mattered? We {{were both}} very young then, {{and we could}} have faced our {{troubles}} and grown up together. Now we're not the same. You let me grow up alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|MARCHBANKS (rising in wild scorn). No, you fool: if she {{had done}} that I should never have seen that I was in Heaven already. Repulsed me! You <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> saved me--virtuous indignation! Oh, you are not worthy {{to live in the}} same world with her. (He turns away contemptuously {{to the other side of}} the room.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been possible, {{considering}} {{her long}} wearisome journey. People {{have often been}} suffocated in their beds before they awoke. But it was hardly likely a body would be completely burnt to ashes as this was assumed to be, though nobody seemed to see it at the time. And how positive the surgeon was too, about those bits of bone! Why {{he should have been}} so, nobody can tell. I cannot help saying that if it has ever been possible to find pure stupidity incarnate, it was in that jury of Carriford. There existed in the mass the stupidity of twelve and not the penetration of one.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then at {{last she}} spoke. [...] "I did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> treated me in this way, Captain Aylmer! I did not expect <b>that</b> you <b>would</b> insult me!" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{is likely}} that the Indians and desperadoes were much chagrined to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to hold off for two days, but if so they made no sign.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done that; {{there could}} have been no object for his putting the power of {{demanding}} his money and valuables out of his possession." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{continued}} {{to go on}} their way together, and as they passed by a cherry tree the giant grasped the top of it, where the ripest fruit hung, gave the branches into the tailor's hand, and bade him eat. But the little tailor was far too weak to hold the tree down, and when the giant let go the tree swung back into the air, bearing the little tailor with it. When he had fallen to the ground again without hurting himself, the giant said: [...] "What! {{do you mean to}} tell me you haven't the strength to hold down a feeble twig?" [...] "It wasn't strength that was wanting," [...] replied the tailor; [...] "do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been anything for a man who has killed seven at a blow? I jumped over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting among the branches near us. Do you do the like if you dare." [...] The giant made an attempt, but couldn't get over the tree, and stuck fast in the branches, so that here too the little tailor had the better of him.|$|E
5000|$|Wilder and Diamond insisted their {{dialogue}} {{be delivered}} exactly as written and clearly {{enough to be}} understood easily. Jack Lemmon, who portrayed Hildy Johnson, later said, [...] "I had one regret about the film. Billy would not let us overlap our lines more. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made it better ... I feel it's a piece in which you must overlap. But Billy, the writer, wanted to hear all of the words clearly, and he wanted the audience to hear the words. I {{would have liked to}} overlap {{to the point where you}} lost some of the dialogue." ...|$|E
5000|$|Some {{coverage}} {{was critical of}} Musburger's comments as sexist, and an ESPN spokesperson issued an apology. Webb told Matt Lauer {{that she was not}} offended by the remarks and did not feel an apology from ESPN was necessary. [...] "I think the media has been really unfair to Musburger ... I think that if he would have said ... that we were hot or sexy or made any derogatory statements like that, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a little bit different. But the fact that he said we were beautiful and gorgeous, I don't see why any woman wouldn't be flattered by that", she added.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hathorn turned pale, and {{he began}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been wiser for him to have {{followed}} Ned's advice, and not to have brought the matter into court.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} spoken to my aunt about it, but I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been {{contented}} to hear that you were to become the wife of Mr. Twentyman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Did {{you ever}} know {{anything}} so unlucky? But {{he had promised}} Mr. Sowerby before he heard that you were coming. Pray do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gone away had he known it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Judd Nelson {{reflected}} on his role:Cowboys and Indians, cops and robbers. That`s the way Billy Turner sees it--it`s good guys and bad guys. He`s the misunderstood hero now. What, is he {{out of his}} mind? He doesn't even know what`s going on. Billy Turner is supposedly on a quest {{to find out who}} killed his father, but as soon as he gets a gun in his hand, it`s like: `Hey--I`ve got a gun in my hand!`It`s a little like real life--sometimes you don`t know what you`re supposed to be doing, even when you`re doing it."I think it's very exciting that a woman would direct a film of the Peckinpah mode rather the sweet, postman- falls-in-love-with-the-divorcee mode," [...] said Nelson. [...] "I think it could have been filmed in black and white with a blue tint. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been the coolest." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kay {{explained}} {{the situation in}} Iraq before the war further in a 1 February 2004 interview on Fox News Sunday: [...] "I think Iraq was a dangerous place and becoming more dangerous, because, in fact, what we observe is that the regime itself was coming apart. It was descending into worse the part of moral depravity and corruption. Saddam was isolated in a fantasy land capable of wreaking tremendous harm and terror on his individual citizens, but corruption, money gain was the root cause. At {{the same time that}} we know there were terrorist groups in state still seeking WMD capability. Iraq , although I found no weapons, had tremendous capabilities in this area. A marketplace phenomena was about to occur, if it did not occur; sellers meeting buyers. And I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been very dangerous if the war had not intervened." [...] sic ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Safe & Sound" [...] {{was written}} by Taylor Swift, Joy Williams, John Paul White, and T-Bone Burnett. In summer 2011, Lionsgate {{required}} Burnett to record songs for The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond, and he subsequently corralled a range of artists, including Swift, Maroon 5, The Civil Wars, and Arcade Fire. On a fall night in 2011, Burnett and the production team, as well as Swift and The Civil Wars, came to Burnett's house in Los Angeles to write the lyrics. After two hours, the song was finished. Swift further elaborated, [...] "The Civil Wars had a show that night in L.A., so they raced right over to T Bone's house. There's so many things he could've done production-wise to make that song bigger sonically than it is, but I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> possibly been a mistake. For him to have left the song as a lullaby is brilliant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she said, {{a little}} timidly, [...] "I don't {{understand}} this at all, {{but it is}} terribly tragic. Do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> lived {{if he had not}} undertaken the journey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course he'll give it. I've a {{right to}} {{it as much as}} Augusta." [...] There was {{something}} in Gertrude's face as she said this which made her mother <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> her way.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had a hurried {{line from}} him with {{information}} to that effect," [...] the Duke answered. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been more respectful {{if he had}} called to see me on his way through London." ...|$|R
5000|$|Gun {{was outraged}} by the email, and took a printed copy of it home with her. After contemplating the email over the weekend, Gun gave the email to {{a friend who was}} acquainted with journalists. Gun would hear no more of the email until Sunday 2 March, when she saw the email {{reproduced}} {{on the front page of}} The Observer newspaper. Less than a week after the Observer story, on Wednesday 5 March, Gun had confessed to her line manager at GCHQ that she had leaked the email, and was arrested. In a BBC interview with Jeremy Paxman, she admitted that she had not raised the matter with staff counsellors as she [...] "honestly didn't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had any practical effect." [...] Gun spent a night in police custody and was subsequently charged with breaking the Official Secrets Act eight months later. The case against Gun was dropped after the prosecution declined to offer any evidence. Gun later embarked on a postgraduate degree course in global ethics at Birmingham University.|$|E

5000|$|Cobain was {{accepted}} by Melvins as a producer to the album after an A&R at Atlantic Records, who also ran Cobain's management company, suggested him. Despite receiving a co-producer credit, the extent of Cobain's involvement in the album is questionable. Andrew Earles, who included Houdini on his book, Gimme Indie Rock: 500 Essential American Underground Rock Albums 1981-1996, stated that Cobain allegedly slept {{through most of the}} sessions. Jonathan Burnside, a collaborator of Melvins and engineer on Houdini remembered: [...] "It's not easy reminiscing about making the album Houdini with Kurt Cobain and the Melvins. Bad communication, drugs, majorlabel profiteering, rehab, schedule blowouts, backstabbing, and album miscrediting... it was a devil's album." [...] Speaking to Kerrang! in 2008, Melvins guitarist and vocalist Buzz Osbourne, who later said in 2009 that Cobain was [...] "in no shape to produce anything," [...] remembered: [...] "Houdini was the first album we did for Atlantic Records and certainly our biggest selling record, although not so much that I could put a down-payment on a new Rolls or something! It came on the whole tidal wave of Nirvana stuff and I'm sure if it weren't for that we wouldn't have had interest from a major at all. We wanted to do a record that wouldn't alienate our fans, but we wanted to do one that we would like. We also knew we werenâ€™t gonna be dusting off a platinum album any time soon, you know? We did a bunch of sessions with Kurt Cobain producing, but {{it got to the point}} where he was so out of control that we basically fired him and went our separate ways, which is unfortunate, because I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been fun. Obviously that was a little snapshot of what would end up happening and I don't have a whole lot of fond memories of that - it was an absolute tragedy." ...|$|E
40|$|On September 5, 2003, my {{wife and}} I left to go on vacation. We planned to spend two weeks {{wandering}} around New York State seeing all the sights. When we left the house, I turned off my cell phone, but kept my pager on - in case anyone needed {{to get hold of}} me. We had a wonderful weekend. Then, bright and early on Monday morning, my pager went off. It was the Project Manager for one of our spacecraft. She had been trying to reach me on my cell phone since Saturday to tell me that the day after I left, Lockheed-Martin had dropped one of my spacecraft. You can go through your whole career and never have someone drop one of your spacecraft. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been nice. So, {{one of the first things}} I did when I got back, was to inquire whether I could retire retroactively to Friday, so it wouldn't have been on my watch. They just laughed that off. Then we got to work. Almost immediately, four investigation teams were formed - two by Lockheed-Martin and two by NASA. Each was tasked to investigate a different aspect of the accident. These aspects included not only finding out what happened, but also looking for systemic problems in the program, determining next steps, and assessing liability...|$|E
40|$|Health {{supplement}} consumption {{behavior is}} important to maintain health status. The {{purpose of the study}} was to explore the spending pattern on health supplement consumption behavior in Hong Kong older adults population. The present study was a cross-sectional survey study; and was collected from via a street-intercept interview. Participants were approached and invited to response to a questionnaire. The location for data collection was evenly distributed in Hong Kong, Kowloon and New Territories. The questionnaire included demographic data and source of income source, spending habits on health supplement products and whether they performed regular health check. There were 982 participants interviewed; and 46 % was male and 54 % was female. The participants are divided into young-old (age 50 - 69) and old-old group (age 70 or above). The mean age is 67. 93 Â± 10. 386. Most of the participants have regular body check; the major reason is to maintain health. Less than half of the participants spent money on health supplement products; the major reason for such purchase was to maintain health; while for not buying is they did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> any effect in their health. Also, more young-old participants have regular body check and spend more money on health supplement products; while old-old group participants were less likely to concern their health, and they were less likely to perform regular body check and purchase health supplement products. The present research reveals the pattern of the health supplement consumption behavior of young-old and old-old. Young-old group and old-old group have difference pattern according to their difference age-related health condition and the amount of spare money. Different educational programme concern health consciousness and promotion strategy of regular body check and health supplement products need be tailor-made for older adults, and for young old and old-old groups...|$|E
