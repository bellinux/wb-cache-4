A mechanism is examined to convert rotary motion into rectilinear motion using {{the example of a}} gear and rail, with kinematic calculations quoted. Analysis of the “force couple” system is proposed to identify free traction forces. Factors are established that influence the machine’s working movements.

40|$|In {{studying}} the problems on sediment transport {{in a stream}} and stabilities of astream channel, the criterion for mvement of sands and gravels by action of fljw, theso-called critical <b>tractive</b> <b>force,</b> becomes generally important. The present paper dealswith the hydraulic approach to solve the mechanism of the critical <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> ofgraded sand gravels. In {{the first part of}} this paper, the results of some basic experiments on the critical trac-tive force of graded sand gravels, especially the mechanism of sediment transport nearthe critical condition for movement and the sorting effect of flow, are described. It isconcluded from the experiments that the practical definition for the criterion for move-ment of sand gravels proposed by the author in the previous paper can also be appliedto the critical <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> of graded sand gravels, and the sorting effect of flow nearthe critical condition is expressed by a function of size frequency distributions of gradedsand gravels. In the second part, a theory for the critical <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> of graded sand gravels isdeveloped, based on the author's procedure to solve the criterion for movement of sandgravels and the existence of wakes behind sand gravels. It is clarified from the com-parison of the theoretical curve with the results of experiments performed by the authorand some other authorities that the critical <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> of graded sand gravels expressedin the dimensionless form is a function of the standard deviation of graded sand gravels,and the theoretical curve is in good agreement with the experimental results within therange of the standard deviation less than about two.

50|$|In railway engineering, {{the term}} {{tractive}} effort {{is often used}} synonymously with <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> to describe the pulling or pushing capability of a locomotive. In automotive engineering, the terms are distinctive: tractive effort is generally higher than <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> {{by the amount of}} rolling resistance present, and both terms are higher than the amount of drawbar pull by the total resistance present (including air resistance and grade). The published <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> value for any vehicle may be theoretical - that is, calculated from known or implied mechanical properties - or obtained via testing under controlled conditions.

40|$|In this {{research}} study, disc harrowing operations in a loamy sand soil, on an experimental plot of twenty different soil moisture levels at tillage speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 22 m/s and 2. 5 m/s were conducted, using trace tractor techniques. The independent variables: drawbar pull force, rolling (motion) resistance, wheel slip, moisture content, cone index, wheel numeric, contact pressure, speed, width of harrow, depth of harrow, and dependent variable (<b>Tractive</b> <b>force)</b> were measured. Mathematical models using dimensional analysis, describing the tractor tyre-soil interaction were developed and validated.

Analysis of variance using Randomized Complete Block Design in two way analysis was also used to study the effects and interactions of variables on <b>tractive</b> <b>forces.</b> Validation results of the developed <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> models conducted, revealed that harrowing operations recorded the highest coefficient of determination, R 2 = 0. 995 at 2. 5 m/s tillage speed, while R 2 = 0. 990 and 0. 9 were obtained at tillage speeds of 1. 94 m/s and 2, 22 m/s respectively. Analysis of variance between measured and predicted <b>tractive</b> <b>forces</b> showed correlation coefficients, R 2 = 0. 9308, 0. 8999, 0. 9958 and standard errors of 0. 5844, 0. 8628 and 0. 78476 for harrowing at tillage speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 22 m/s, and 2. 5 m/s respectively.

Experiments were conducted for disc ridging operations in a loamy sand soil, at tillage speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 22 m/s and 2. 5 m/s, using trace tractor techniques. <b>Tractive</b> <b>force</b> models at different tillage speeds were developed using dimensional analysis, describing the tractors tyre - soil interaction.

30|$|The femoral condyles of a knee {{prosthesis}} articulate with {{a combination}} of rolling and sliding on the tibial polyethylene plateau. Little is known about potential polyethylene damage due to rolling motion. Since rolling does not exclude the presence of tangential surface loads, this study sought to investigate the influence of tractive rolling on the wear of polyethylene. A “wheel-on-flat” apparatus, consisting of a metal wheel and a polyethylene flat, mimicked contact conditions present in total knee replacement. An increasingly <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> under conditions of pure rolling was applied. It was found that under rolling kinematics a tangential surface load of up to 17 % of the normal load could be transferred through the contact. Surface damage was dependent on the amount of <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> and appeared more severe with higher forces. In the region of highest <b>tractive</b> <b>force,</b> wear features were identified that resembled perpendicular ridges on surfaces of retrieved tibial polyethylene devices. This suggests that tractive rolling may be a relevant wear mode in total knee replacement.|$|R

40|$|Currently {{there is}} a {{research}} project being undertaken by Mr R.

This project involves the development of low-cost no tillage seed drills to be made available to farmers in South East Asia. A prototype seed drill has been designed and manufactured. However there was no rigorous analysis of the structural integrity of the steel frame (toolbar) and tine design. The aim of this research project is therefore to analyse the current design and to make recommendations that may improve the product as a whole. In order to determine the forces that the toolbar may encounter, <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> predictions were calculated, along with a sensitivity study of the impact of extra wheel weights. It was found that when compared to the fundamental Bekker model, a more reasonable result is obtained by the empirical Gee Clough <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> prediction model. The predicted <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> is approximately 1. 5 kN.

40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} on the strip road where longitudinal slopes were determined by the leveling method {{as well as individual}} distances of the strip road of uniform slope. Skidders were used for carrying out traction tests in downhill and uphill skidding of 9 different loads. Measurement of wheel loads, wheel torques and components of rope force was performed by tensiometric method and remote transferring of measurement signal. According to the results of research, by the increase of longitudinal slope, more <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> is used for overcoming the terrain slope than for overcoming the traction resistance. In downhill skidding, the horizontal component of the skidder weight (G sina) acts in the skidder travel direction and hence its value is higher than the traction resistance. Torque distribution depends on the skidder wheel vertical load. In uphill skidding, torques increase proportionally to the vertical component of rope forces and adhesive weight of the skidder. In downhill skidding, the skidder wheel torques are negative, because they are not used for achieving wheel <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> and instead, the transmission of torque through the transmission system causes skidder’s braking performance. The skidder’s need for braking arises under influence of the horizontal component of the skidder weight (G sina) that acts {{in the direction of the}} skidder travel and under its effect the traction resistances are overcome. It can be concluded that in case of downhill skidding we cannot speak of achieving real <b>tractive</b> <b>force</b> because the skidder pulls the load only by its weight, and the transmittion from engine to wheels is not used for achieving the <b>tractive</b> <b>force...</b>|$|R
