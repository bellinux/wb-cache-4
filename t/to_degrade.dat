The race ended spectacularly when the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo suffered an engine blow-up on the final straight, just being able to coast his car over the finish line.|$|E
5|$|Mycena purpureofusca {{has been}} {{investigated}} for its potential to decolorize industrial dyes. These dyes, used in textile dyeing and printing processes, are difficult <b>to</b> <b>degrade</b> due to their highly structured organic compounds and pose a major environmental threat. The fungus mycelium produces high levels of laccase, an oxidoreductase enzyme. Laccases are widely used in biotechnology and industry due {{to their ability to}} break down various recalcitrant compounds. M.purpureofusca laccase efficiently breaks down Remazol Brilliant Blue R, an industrially important dye that is frequently used as a starting material in the production of polymeric dyes.|$|E

5|$|Blackleg is a {{fungal disease}} of canola {{that results in}} major yield loss in {{affected}} crops. It overwinters on infected stubble (leftover crop residue) that is left on farm fields, and can continue to produce spores, infecting future crops, until the stubble is buried or broken down completely. The observation that C.olla grows and fruits on canola stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus <b>to</b> <b>degrade</b> canola stubble, and {{reduce the incidence of}} stubble-borne diseases like blackleg and blackspot. In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, C.olla was shown to colonize canola, wheat, and barley residue, but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of canola as compared to the cereal residue.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the IMD {{expected}} Chapala would intensify {{further into}} a super cyclonic storm, and the JTWC anticipated it would strengthen to {{the equivalent of}} a Category5-equivalent on the Saffir-Simpson scale. However, the storm began an eyewall replacement cycle on 30October, causing the inner eyewall <b>to</b> <b>degrade</b> and for an outer eyewall to form; this resulted in a slight drop in intensity. In addition, drier air began affecting the storm, causing the thunderstorms around the eye to diminish. However, Chapala maintained much of its intensity due to strong outflow in all directions, especially to the northeast due to a tropical upper tropospheric trough over India, despite increased wind shear. On 31October, the outer eyewall became established, reaching a diameter of , although the thunderstorms around the eye continued to weaken. On 1November, Chapala passed just north of the island of Socotra, marking the area's first hurricane-force impact since 1922.|$|E
5|$|Late on June21, Celia turned due west as {{it moved}} around {{the south side of}} the ridge {{previously}} steering the hurricane to the west-southwest. A secondary eyewall was noted as it made the turn, indicating that the storm would further intensify once this feature further developed. Several hours later, the storm intensified into a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. After briefly developing a prominent central dense overcast, the storm's structure began <b>to</b> <b>degrade</b> for unknown reasons. By the evening of June22, Celia was downgraded to a Category1 hurricane and the eye was no longer apparent on satellite imagery, mainly due to cirrus clouds over the system. The following morning, the eye reformed and the storm became more vertically aligned, allowing Celia to re-attain Category2 status. Throughout the day, Celia became increasingly organized and intensified, nearly attaining major hurricane status during the afternoon. Operationally, the hurricane was thought to have reached this intensity but post-storm analysis indicated that winds did not exceed 110mph (175km/h).|$|E

5|$|Marasmius rotula is a {{saprobic}} {{species and}} as such obtains nutrients by decomposing dead organic matter. It grows in deciduous forests and fruits in groups or clusters on dead wood (especially beech), woody debris such as twigs or sticks, and occasionally on rotting leaves. The fruit bodies, which are easily overlooked because of their diminutive size, are often present in abundance after rains. The species is relatively intolerant of low water potentials, and will grow poorly {{or not at all}} under water stress conditions. It is unable <b>to</b> <b>degrade</b> leaf litter until it becomes more fragmented and more compacted so that the water-holding capacity increases in the deeper layers of the soil. The magnolia warbler has been noted to line its nests with the fruit bodies' stems.|$|E
5|$|Pholiota squarrosa {{is thought}} to be a white rot fungus, which use {{cellulose}} as a carbon source, and have the ability <b>to</b> <b>degrade</b> the lignin (present in wood) to carbon dioxide to access the cellulose molecule. The fungus can attack a wide variety of deciduous host trees, including sugar maple, red maple, yellow birch, paper birch, American beech, and white ash. It can also attack conifers, like spruce. The fungus is a secondary parasite, in that it attacks trees that have already been weakened from prior injury or infection by bacteria or other fungi. It also functions as a saprobe, and can obtain nutrients by breaking down organic matter in dead wood.|$|E
5|$|Proteasomes {{are part}} of a major {{mechanism}} by which cells regulate the concentration of particular proteins and degrade misfolded proteins. Proteins are tagged for degradation with a small protein called ubiquitin. The tagging reaction is catalyzed by enzymes called ubiquitin ligases. Once a protein is tagged with a single ubiquitin molecule, this is a signal to other ligases to attach additional ubiquitin molecules. The result is a polyubiquitin chain that is bound by the proteasome, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>degrade</b> the tagged protein. The degradation process yields peptides of about seven to eight amino acids long, which can then be further degraded into shorter amino acid sequences and used in synthesizing new proteins.|$|E
40|$|Noise-vocoded {{speech is}} a spectrally highly {{degraded}} signal, but it preserves the temporal envelope of speech. Listeners vary considerably {{in their ability}} to adapt <b>to</b> this <b>degraded</b> speech signal. Here, we hypothesised that individual differences in adaptation to vocoded speech should be predictable by non-speech auditory, cognitive, and neuroanatomical factors. We tested eighteen normal-hearing participants in a short-term vocoded speech-learning paradigm (listening to 100 4 -band-vocoded sentences). Non-speech auditory skills were assessed using amplitude modulation (AM) rate discrimination, where modulation rates were centered on the speech-relevant rate of 4 Hz. Working memory capacities were evaluated (digit span and nonword repetition), and structural MRI scans were examined for anatomical predictors of vocoded speech learning using voxel-based morphometry. Listeners who learned faster <b>to</b> understand <b>degraded</b> speech also showed smaller thresholds in the AM discrimination task. This ability <b>to</b> adjust <b>to</b> <b>degraded</b> speech is furthermore reflected anatomically in increased volume in an area of the left thalamus (pulvinar) that is strongly connected to the auditory and prefrontal cortices. Thus, individual non-speech auditory skills and left thalamus grey matter volume can predict how quickly a listener adapts <b>to</b> <b>degraded</b> speech...|$|R

50|$|A {{real-world}} {{example of}} hysteresis {{is helpful to}} illustrate the concept. Coral reef systems can dramatically shift from pristine coral-dominated systems <b>to</b> <b>degraded</b> algae-dominated systems when populations grazing on algae decline. The 1983 crash of sea urchin populations in Caribbean reef systems released algae from top-down (herbivory) control, allowing them to overgrow corals and resulting in a shift <b>to</b> a <b>degraded</b> state. When urchins rebounded, the high (pre-crash) coral cover levels did not return, indicating hysteresis (Mumby et al. 2007).|$|R
5|$|The {{ability of}} {{bacteria}} <b>to</b> <b>degrade</b> {{a variety of}} organic compounds is remarkable and {{has been used in}} waste processing and bioremediation. Bacteria capable of digesting the hydrocarbons in petroleum are often used to clean up oil spills. Fertiliser was added to some of the beaches in Prince William Sound in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. These efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil. Bacteria are also used for the bioremediation of industrial toxic wastes. In the chemical industry, bacteria are most important in the production of enantiomerically pure chemicals for use as pharmaceuticals or agrichemicals.|$|E
5|$|The city {{is built}} on the slope {{surrounding}} the citadel, located on a dominating plateau. Although the city's walls {{were built in the}} third century and the city itself was first mentioned in the 12th century, the majority of the existing buildings date from 17th and 18th centuries. Typical houses consist of a tall stone block structure which can be up to five stories high. There are external and internal staircases that surround the house. It is thought that such design stems from fortified country houses typical in southern Albania. The lower storey of the building contains a cistern and the stable. The upper storey is composed of a guest room and a family room containing a fireplace. Further upper stories are to accommodate extended families and are connected by internal stairs. Since Gjirokastër's membership to UNESCO, a number of houses have been restored, though others continue <b>to</b> <b>degrade.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood. Most {{studies have focused on}} the mating-type region in fission yeast, which may not be representative of activities in other genomic regions/organisms. In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions, RITS forms a complex with siRNAs complementary to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones, acting co-transcriptionally <b>to</b> <b>degrade</b> any nascent pre-mRNA transcripts that are initiated by RNA polymerase. The formation of such a heterochromatin region, though not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, presumably because dicer is required to generate the initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent transcripts. Heterochromatin maintenance has been suggested to function as a self-reinforcing feedback loop, as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes. The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway.|$|E
40|$|Different {{areas of}} human visual cortex {{are thought to}} play {{different}} roles in the learning of visual information: whereas in low/intermediate cortical areas, plasticity may be manifested by enhanced selectivity to learned visual features, in higher-level areas, plasticity may result in generalization and development of tolerance <b>to</b> <b>degraded</b> versions of the learned stimuli. The most effective tolerance <b>to</b> <b>degraded</b> information is presumably achieved {{in the case of}} cooperation between the different forms of plasticity. Whether this tolerance <b>to</b> <b>degraded</b> information also applies when the visual input is degraded {{as a result of a}} lesion to lower levels of the visual system remains an open question. To address this, we studied visual classification learning in a patient with an extensive bilateral lesion affecting intermediate/low-level visual areas but sparing higher-level areas. Despite difficulty in perceiving the stimuli, the patient learned to classify them, albeit not as quickly as control participants. Moreover, the patient 2 ̆ 7 s learning was maintained over the long term and was accompanied by improved discrimination of individual stimuli. These findings demonstrate that degraded output from lesioned, lower areas can be exploited in the service of a new visual task and the results likely implicate a combination of bottom-up and top-down processing during visual learning...|$|R
40|$|The {{degradation}} of forage cell walls by rumen bacteria was investigated with critical-point drying/scanning electron microscopy and ruthenium red staining/transmission electron microscopy. Differences {{were observed in}} the manner of attachment of different morphological types of rumen bacteria to plant cell walls during degradation. Cocci, constituting about 22 % of the attached bacteria, appeared to be attached <b>to</b> <b>degraded</b> plant walls via capsule-like substances averaging 58 nm in width (range, 21 to 84 nm). Many bacilli appeared to adhere to forage substrates without distinct capsule-like material, although unattached bacteria with capsules were observed occasionally. Certain bacili appeared to be attached <b>to</b> <b>degraded</b> tissue via small amounts of extracellular material, but others apparently had no extracellular material. Bacilli with a distinct morphology due to an irregularly folded, electron-dense outer layer or layers (about 15 nm thick) and without fibrous extracellular material consituted about 37 % of the attached bacteria and were observed to adhere so closely <b>to</b> <b>degraded</b> plant walls that the bacterial shape conformed to the shape of the degraded zone. In the rumen ecosystem, bacteria appeared to adhere to plant substrates during degradation by capsule-like material and by small amounts of extracellular material, {{as well as by the}} other means not observable by electron microscopy...|$|R

5|$|Throughout October25, banding {{features}} {{developed and}} the upper-level outflow became better established. In {{response to a}} ridge to the east, the depression tracked in a general west-northwest direction. Intensification was likely as the system was forecast to remain within an environment characterized by low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Later that day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Zeke, the record-breaking twenty-fourth named storm of the year. Within several hours of being upgraded, Zeke began <b>to</b> <b>degrade</b> for unknown reasons, with convection lessening around the center. Increasing westerly wind shear, associated with a mid to upper-level trough approaching {{the west coast of}} the United States, later caused the system to weaken further; however, Zeke managed to maintain tropical storm intensity until the morning of October27.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to U.S. Army {{regulations}} as well, {{no charges}} were ever filed against Stone {{nor did he}} stand trial. While he was in solitary confinement at Fort Lafayette, he could not exercise, and consequently Stone's health began <b>to</b> <b>degrade.</b> His physicians protested heavily to Stanton, who ordered him transferred to the military prison at Fort Hamilton. There Stone was allowed to exercise and his condition improved. He stayed at Fort Lafayette for fifty days, and would spend another 139 in Fort Hamilton. Stone was finally released without explanation or apology on August 16, 1862. The reason for his release was new legislation written by California Senator James A. McDougall. In a small addition to another bill, McDougall reiterated the Articles of War requirement that official charges be filed within eight days of arrest, but went on to include that any imprisoned officer must be given their trial within thirty days. McDougall also made it clear this legislation applied to those currently under arrest, which covered Stone's case. It passed the U.S. Congress and {{was signed into law}} by President Lincoln on July 17, 1862. Stanton then waited the thirty days before releasing Stone.|$|E
5|$|Maricello's super soft tyres began <b>to</b> <b>degrade</b> quickly, {{allowing}} Rossi and Vandoorne to draw closer {{over the}} next two laps. Rossi caught Maricello by the start of the sixth lap but the latter remained on the circuit. King, who was delayed by a long queue of vehicles behind him, was the first driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the same lap and rejoined the track in clear air. On lap eight, Matsushita collided heavily with de Jong at the Novelle chicane, causing him to retire and was later penalised with a three-place grid penalty for the sprint race after the stewards judged him to have missed the corner's braking point. De Jong was able to continue. Marciello made his pit stop for new tyres on the next lap, allowing Rossi and Vandoorne to move into the first and second places and both drivers built an advantage over the remainder of the field. Maricello rejoined in eleventh, behind Pic, who made his pit stop one lap later. Sørensen was placed into the Casino Hairpin barriers at the apex of the corner by Nato on lap ten, ending his race. Nato was issued with a ten-second time penalty, but no safety car was deployed. Marvelov retired from the race in the pit lane with damage to his car after running off the circuit, and drove over a kerb exiting the left-hand Louis Chiron corner, causing him to become airborne, and hit the barriers lining the track.|$|E
