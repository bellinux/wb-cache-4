[...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going {{to get out there and}} tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> it.

500|$|Eager {{to explore}} the music video medium, Stipe secured funding for a short film that would {{accompany}} music from {{the first half of}} Reckoning. Stipe's concept was to film the project at folk artist R.A. Miller's Whirlgig Farm, and he recruited Athens filmmaker James Herbert to direct it. In March 1984 R.E.M. filmed Left of Reckoning at the Whirlgig Farm in Rabbittown, Georgia. The short film draws its title {{from the fact that it}} is soundtracked by five songs that appear on the [...] "L" [...] side of the vinyl version of Reckoning: [...] "Harborcoat", [...] "7 Chinese Bros.", [...] "So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry)", [...] "Pretty Persuasion", [...] "Time After Time (AnnElise)", in addition to [...] "Second Guessing" [...] from the R side. In contrast to standard music video imagery, the film consists primarily of footage of the band members wandering around the farm, while Herbert utilizes close-ups, silhouettes, and slow motion footage. Herbert utilized rephotography during the editing process, which involved taking photographs of film frames at random, while also closing in or pulling back from the image with no regard to narrative. According to Buck, [...] "It was really inexpensive to make and kind of fun. We just asked [...] to edit something to four minutes' length, but he's used to making 20-minute films, that's the length he works in. He just made this film <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> the first side of the record." [...] While MTV did not air the complete film, the channel's program The Cutting Edge (funded by I.R.S.) aired the [...] "Time After Time (AnnElise)" [...] segment, and the snippet featuring [...] "Pretty Persuasion" [...] was aired by other music programs.|$|E
500|$|Le Guin {{described}} {{the role of}} magic in the novel in the following manner: [...] "in Gifts, the powers of magic are kind of warped. They are mostly used aggressively and destructively and defensively, actually. You know, it’s like having that secret weapon that they use against each other. It’s all gone kind of sour." [...] The characters in the novel often fail to understand the responsibility <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> their power; only {{by the end of}} the story do Orrec and Gry come to terms with their gifts, and understand the best way to use them. Orrec's power is misunderstood for much of the novel: he has inherited his mother's ability to tell stories, rather than his father's ability to unmake things. However, he also has power in his reputation, as a person to be feared. Much of the novel is concerned with the abuse of power, and the problems with following without thinking of consequences, as well as the violence that is contained in the Upland society. Although Orrec's father Canoc he too does not hesitate to use his power for his own ends: his wife Melle was taken in a raid, over the course of which Canoc slew another man. He nonetheless shows more forethought than some of the other characters in the novel, and actually asks Melle to be his wife; he also gives gifts to her town in return. Melle's stories form an important part of the children's morality, featuring as they do a number of characters exhibiting kindness and altruism, in contrast to the Upland culture. The violence within the Upland society is exemplified in the person of Ogge Drum, who is depicted as a thief and a bully. He lusts after Melle, and kills her with his gift when he realizes he cannot have her.|$|E

2500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{also found}} [...] "below the bleak, seasick surfaces" [...] a [...] "deeply romantic streak that complicates {{the idea of}} who or what Zola Jesus is", noting that [...] "t's this disarming sensuality that allowed Danilova to fit in {{alongside}} Beck and Mike Patton at a recent Serge Gainsbourg tribute at the Hollywood Bowl." [...] Evan Hanlon of Dusted Magazine opined that [...] "Seekir" [...] "is the closest Zola Jesus gets to a club hit" [...] and even draws parallels with Lady Gaga: [...] "There is the singular, artistic persona that represents an entire project of identity. The moody drama that stems from this persona infused into each song. The challenge to popular music orthodoxy from within the system. And above all, the placement of a powerful operatic voice at the focal point, and in Nika Roza Danilova's case, the classical training <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] Now reviewer Anupa Mistry agreed, stating: [...] "Like her prior work, the songs are thematically dark and diffuse, but the dancey impulses on 'Vessel' and 'Seekir' signal headier paths ahead. Could Zola Jesus be the inverse Lady Gaga?" [...] Reef Younis, writing for Clash, remarked that [...] "tepping {{out of the shadows}} suits her after all." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "No Idea" [...] {{is based}} upon the film Inception (2010), {{specifically}} the scene where the character Dom Cobb has a dream relationship with his wife. Gaskarth said it was [...] "actually something I can relate to, as there is someone from my past I'm distanced with now and the only at I can revisit that time is in my dreams. It made for a cool song." [...] Gaskarth called [...] "A Daydream Away" [...] the [...] "kind of front porch, snare brushes and acoustic guitar slow jam I always wanted to write."

2500|$|Sonnet 154 {{continues}} the main themes that {{were presented in}} Sonnet 153. In the first quatrain, the man wishes that his beauty be passed onto his heir. The second quatrain asks {{the question of how}} beauty can be maintained through time and poetry. Finally, the third ends with the woeful realization that the preservation of happiness is problematic in and of itself. The rhyme scheme within Sonnet 153 and 154 is inconsistent in that the words do not necessarily follow the same sounds. Lines 10 and 12 end with the words [...] "perpetual" [...] and [...] "thrall" [...] and lines 13 and 14 end with [...] "prove" [...] and [...] "love." [...] Authors argue that this off-beat rhyme scheme is either meant to further represent the [...] "disappointment and disillusion" [...] (Duncan-Jones) of the character's worry towards his incurable love or sickness or it is only an exaggeration of the overwhelming excitement <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> being in love. Either way, the placement of these particular words highly contrasts to the simple rhyming of the simpler lines {{in the beginning of the}} sonnet. In the form of ababcdcdefefgg, the 10 syllables per 14 lines are organized into three quatrains and within this boundaries of this short piece, Shakespeare emphasizes his common theme of unrequited love for a seemingly unattainable mistress or the [...] "Dark Lady". The difference between Sonnet 154 and Sonnet 153, however, lies in the fact that Sonnet 154 strays away from the Greek six-line epigram in which it was originally derived from. It is thought that Sonnet 154 is merely an extension of the idea that tortured love cannot be extinguished by [...] "water" [...] but only a [...] "mistress' eyes".|$|E

As in this case it is the consciousness <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> the substance, when one part is separate from another, which makes the same person, and constitutes this inseparable self: so it is in reference to substances remote in time.
