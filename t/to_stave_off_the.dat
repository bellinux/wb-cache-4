5|$|Mathias {{was elected}} to the Senate in 1968, {{unseating}} the incumbent Democrat, Daniel Brewster, who twenty years earlier had been his roommate while attending the University of Maryland School of Law. He continued his record as a liberal Republican in the Senate, and frequently clashed with the conservative wing of his party. For a few months in late 1975 and early 1976, Mathias considered running an insurgent presidential campaign in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> increasing influence of conservative Republicans led by Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Civil War, Dixon {{participated in a}} {{convention}} of border states and a peace convention in Frankfort, Kentucky, both in 1861. Both conventions were unsuccessful. At {{the outset of the}} war, the Kentucky General Assembly elected six arbiters to recommend a course of action for the Commonwealth. Dixon represented the pro-Union position along with John J. Crittenden and Samuel S. Nicholas. Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin, John C. Breckinridge, and Richard Hawes represented the southern sympathizers. The arbiters met on May 11, 1861. After the pro-Union men defeated a proposal to call a sovereignty convention, the six arbiters recommended a position of neutrality, which the General Assembly adopted.|$|E
5|$|Morehead was a {{delegate}} to the Peace Conference of 1861 and the Border States Convention that attempted <b>to</b> <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Civil War. Although he favored Kentucky's neutrality, Morehead sympathized with the South and was an open critic of the Lincoln administration. He was imprisoned for disloyalty in September 1861, although no formal charges were ever brought against him. He {{was released from prison}} in January 1862, and afterward fled to Canada, Europe, and Mexico. After the war, he returned to the United States and settled on his plantation in Greenville, Mississippi, where he died on December 21, 1868.|$|E

5|$|Several stories also feature knights {{struggling}} <b>to</b> <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> {{advances of}} voluptuous women, including Yder, the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The Green Knight parallel in these stories is a King testing a knight {{as to whether}} or not he will remain chaste in extreme circumstances. The woman he sends is sometimes his wife (as in Yder), if he knows that she is unfaithful and will tempt other men; in The Knight of the Sword the king sends his beautiful daughter. All characters playing the Green Knight's role kill unfaithful knights who fail their tests.|$|E
5|$|A {{plea for}} a review by the Constitutional Tribunal was sought as a last-ditch attempt <b>to</b> <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> {{execution}} of drug trafficker Shanmugam Murugesu. Shanmugam's lawyer contended that his client's right to equal protection under Article 12 of the Constitution had been infringed. Referring to cases of six recent offenders similarly convicted under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Shanmugam's lawyer {{drew attention to the}} fact that those offenders had imported more than 700grammes of cannabis, an offence which attracted the death penalty, but were eventually charged with possessing less than 500grammes of cannabis which resulted only in a jail sentence. In contrast, Shanmugam, who had imported 1,029.8grammes of cannabis, did not have the amount reduced and was sentenced to death. The plea was rejected by the President on 12 May 2005, one day before the execution date.|$|E
5|$|The stories The Girl {{with the}} Mule (alternately titled The Mule Without a Bridle) and Hunbaut feature Gawain in {{beheading}} game situations. In Hunbaut, Gawain cuts off a man's head and, {{before he can}} replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle <b>to</b> <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> advances of voluptuous women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include Yder, the Lancelot-Grail, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight is tested {{to see whether or}} not he will remain chaste in trying circumstances.|$|E
5000|$|Arthur and Suttner {{were largely}} {{socially}} isolated in Georgia; their poverty {{rather than their}} social status restricted their engagement with high society, and neither ever became fluent speakers of Mingrelian or Georgian. <b>To</b> <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> starvation, <b>the</b> couple each began writing as a career. While Arthur's writing during this period is dominated by local themes, Suttner's was not similarly influenced by Georgian culture.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} refinanced as Angus Sanderson (1921) Ltd and moved {{production}} from Birtley, County Durham to the Grahame-White aircraft factory in Hendon, Middlesex in 1921 and {{toyed with the}} idea of building a smaller 8 hp car in 1925 but few, if any were built.

5|$|Reich {{joined the}} Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War, serving from 1915 to 1918, {{for the last}} two years as a {{lieutenant}} at the Italian front with 40 men under his command. When the war ended he headed for Vienna, enrolling in law at the University of Vienna, but found it dull and switched to medicine after the first semester. He arrived with nothing in a city with little to offer; the overthrow of the Austria-Hungarian empire a few weeks earlier had left the newly formed Republic of German-Austria in the grip of famine. Reich lived on soup, oats and dried fruit from the university canteen, and shared an unheated room with his brother and another undergraduate, wearing his coat and gloves indoors <b>to</b> <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> cold. He fell in love with another medical student, Lia Laszky, with whom he was dissecting a corpse, but it was largely unrequited.|$|E
5|$|As railroads {{began to}} become more common, {{attendance}} of the Mountain Grove Campground began to decline. The attendance of the campground dropped severely in 1891. On July 9, 1891, the campground placed an unusually large advertisement in a local newspaper. Attendance continued to drop in 1892. The decline continued, despite efforts by the campground directors {{to increase the number}} of Chautauqua speakers and religious speakers. Attempts were made throughout the 1890s <b>to</b> <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> impending failure of the campground, but were largely unsuccessful. Later, the Board of Managers decided that they would open the campground specifically for special events, such as the Bloomsburg Methodist Church's plans for an eleven-car special train to carry picnickers and a band there. By the mid-1890s, it was permitted for visitors to bring their own supplies, rent multiple tents, and decide whether to stay for one or two weeks. A short branch line of the Danville, Hazleton, and Wilkes-Barre Railroad was then built to allow easier transport of visitors' baggage to the campground. Baggage carrying was also done for free and the attendance fee was also reduced. Only one of the twenty-five prominent local families who attended the camp meeting in the 1880s still attended it in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution {{introduces}} {{separation of}} powers. According to Belarusian law, each office is separate but {{must work together}} to serve the people. The Constitution also makes Belarus a presidential democracy, significantly reducing {{the role of the}} prime minister. Of the fifteen former Soviet republics, Belarus was the one of latest to create and pass a new constitution subsequent to the dissolution of the USSR. A delay occurred due to debates among Supreme Soviet deputies, who were also trying <b>to</b> <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> opposition and democratic forces who wanted to close the Supreme Soviet down for good. A power struggle to determine the relationship between the new executive branch and the legislature caused much of the debate in 1992 and 1993. The former chairman of the Supreme Soviet, Stanislau Shushkevich, criticized the early drafts due to the amount of power granted to the president. The opposition Belarusian Popular Front criticized the final drafts {{due to the lack of}} balance between the two parties and for allowing Vyachaslau Kebich to run for presidential elections in June of that year despite serving in the same role with the SSR.|$|E

5|$|Lindwall {{showed his}} {{versatility}} {{again in the}} First Test in Brisbane, scoring an unbeaten 38 in the second innings to extend Australia's lead to 373. When South Africa attempted to chase the target, Lindwall took 5/60 to cut them down 96 runs short of victory. Lindwall was reunited with Miller when the latter returned from injury for the Second Test at Melbourne, and despite the old combination taking 12 wickets, with Lindwall taking match figures of 5/116, Australia fell 82 runs short and South Africa had its first Test win against Australia in 42 years. The teams moved to the home ground of Miller and Lindwall for the Third Test in Sydney, and the local pair delivered, taking seven wickets between them to skittle the tourists for 173, with Lindwall taking 4/40. With Australia having taken a 270 first innings lead, Lindwall allowed Australia to seize the initiative, removing both openers in his first three overs, before ending with 4/72 to ensure an innings victory and a 2â1 series lead. The value of Lindwall and Miller were demonstrated during the final two Tests. At the Fourth Test in Adelaide, both broke down mid-game and left Australia two bowlers short. Chasing 377, the South Africans managed <b>to</b> <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bowling and secure a draw. Both were absent for the Fifth Test in Melbourne and South Africa capitalised, defeating the Australians by six wickets despite the home side having scored 520 in their first innings. The absence of Lindwall and Miller's new ball partnership allowed South Africa to fight back and draw the series 2â2, making it the first series that Australia had not won since 1938. Lindwall had taken 19 wickets at 20.16 in just {{three and a half}} Tests for the series, and Australia seemed unlikely to find replacements for their leading strike pair anytime soon; their eventual successors Richie Benaud and Alan Davidson were still to become regular internationals.|$|E

25|$|Though he knew {{repealing}} the laws {{would mean the}} end of his ministry, Peel decided to do so. It is possible that Peel merely used the Irish Famine as an excuse to repeal the Corn Laws as he had been an intellectual convert to free trade since the 1820s. Blake points out that if Peel were convinced that total repeal was necessary <b>to</b> <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> famine, he would have enacted a bill that brought about immediate temporary repeal, not permanent repeal over a three-year period of gradual tapering-off of duties.|$|E
25|$|But just as French vignerons were {{recovering}} from oidium came a new mysterious ailment that caused decay or {{death in the}} grapevines. The cause was a tiny louse, known as phylloxera, imported from North America. This louse targets the rootstock of the vine. The solution to this epidemic also came from North America in the grafting of naturally resistant American rootstocks to the European vines. However, while the importing of this new North American plant material helped <b>to</b> <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> phylloxera epidemic, it brought with it yet more problems-the fungal disease of downy mildew that first surfaced in 1878 and black rot that followed in the 1880s.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, an erect posture demands precise balance, {{the result}} of a rapidly {{functioning}} neuromuscular system. This suggests endothermic metabolism, because an ectothermic animal would be unable to walk or run, and thus to evade predators, when its core temperature was lowered. Other evidence for endothermy includes limb length (many dinosaurs possessed comparatively long limbs) and bipedalism, both found today only in endotherms. Many bipedal dinosaurs possessed gracile leg bones with a short thigh relative to calf length. This is generally an adaptation to frequent sustained running, characteristic of endotherms which, unlike ectotherms, are capable of producing sufficient energy <b>to</b> <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> onset of anaerobic metabolism in the muscle.|$|E
25|$|On day 46, he {{was moved}} to York General Hospital, {{suffering}} from dehydration after having spent the week vomiting.

According to Mann, his supporters were bringing him tape recordings of the talks with the government, which he was having difficulty concentrating on. Mann writes that Horne decided to take some orange juice and sweet tea for three days, in order <b>to</b> <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coma {{so that he could}} understand the negotiations.

25|$|The {{third period}} began with more Russian pressure, {{including}} a close chance off the post by Evgeni Malkin, {{but at the}} midway point of the period Russian Alexei Emelin was given a five-minute major and {{thrown out of the}} game for clipping JaromÃ­r JÃ¡gr, who did not return {{for the remainder of the}} game. This was followed by more penalty trouble for both teams. In the final minutes after pulling goaltender Semyon Varlamov, Pavel Datsyuk buried a goal on a 5-on-3 with 35 seconds left, bringing Russia within one goal of the Czechs. Under pressure the Czech goalie TomÃ¡Å¡ Vokoun managed <b>to</b> <b>stave</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> final Russian assault and the Czechs held on to win the game 2â1.|$|E
