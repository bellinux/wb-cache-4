President Lula urged Barack Obama to end a <b>trade</b> <b>dispute</b> between Brazil and the US over cotton subsidies after the WTO gave Brazil the formal go-ahead in 2009 to impose sanctions on imports of over 100 US goods. Lamy highlighted the difficulty of obtaining agreement from the US without the presidential fast-track authority and biennial elections. One of the consequences of the economic crisis of 2008–2009 is the desire of political leaders to shelter their constituents from the increasingly competitive market experienced during market contractions. Lamy hoped that the drop in trade of 12% in 2009, quoted as the largest annual drop since the Second World War, could be countered by successful conclusion of the Doha round.|$|E

The changes made to the Dock Labour Scheme in 1967 ensured a complete end to casual labour on the docks, effectively giving workers the security of jobs for life.

In 1929, he proposed a dramatic act to the HSRA intended to gain massive publicity for their aims. Influenced by Auguste Vaillant, a French anarchist who had bombed the Chamber of Deputies in Paris, Singh's plan was to explode a bomb inside the Central Legislative Assembly. The nominal intention was to protest against the Public Safety Bill, and the <b>Trade</b> <b>Dispute</b> Act, which had been rejected by the Assembly but were being enacted by the Viceroy using his special powers; the actual intention was for the perpetrators to allow themselves to be arrested so that they could use court appearances as a stage to publicise their cause.|$|E
25|$|In March 2010, the WTO {{ruled that}} European governments unfairly financed Airbus.

In two separate findings issued in May 2011, the WTO found, firstly, that the US defence budget and NASA research grants {{could not be used}} as vehicles to subsidise the civilian aerospace industry and that Boeing must repay $5.3 billion of illegal subsidies. Secondly, the WTO Appellate Body partly overturned an earlier ruling that European Government launch aid constituted unfair subsidy, agreeing with the point of principle that the support was not aimed at boosting exports and some forms of public-private partnership could continue. Part of the $18bn in low interest loans received would have to be repaid eventually; however, there was no immediate need for it to be repaid and the exact value to be repaid would be set at a future date.

Considering the many successes that the Nepalese army had seen during the expansion campaign of Nepal, Bhimsen Thapa was one of the main proponents of the war with the British, which was against the better advice of the likes of Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa, who actually did the fighting and knew about the hardships of war.

The union must inform the employer of the result [...] "as soon as reasonably practicable", call action within four weeks, and tell the employer of the people taking part. The rules are poorly drafted, and this has generated litigation where some courts allowed injunctions on ostensible technical glitches.

However, in April, a report titled [...] "1989 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers" [...] from Office of the United States Trade Representative have specifically listed {{the system as a}} trade barrier in Japan. The report claimed that the adoption of TRON-based system by Japanese government is advantageous to Japanese manufacturers, and thus excluding US Operating Systems from the huge new market, specifically the report have listed MS-DOS, OS/2 and UNIX as examples. The Office of USTR was allegedly under Microsoft's influence as its former officer Tom Robertson was then offered a lucrative position by Microsoft. While the TRON system itself have been subsequently removed from the list of sanction by the Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 after protests by the organization in May 1989, the <b>trade</b> <b>dispute</b> have caused Ministry of International Trade and Industry to accept opinion from Masayoshi Son to cancel Center of Educational Computing's selection of TRON-based system for the use of education computers.

2500|$|There is no {{consensus}} {{about the status of}} the right to strike at common law. On the one hand, the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed that [...] "to cease work except for higher wages, and a strike in consequence, was lawful at common law", that [...] "right of workmen to strike is an essential element in the principle of collective bargaining", [...] "that workmen have a right to strike", and that this is [...] "a fundamental human right". This view would accord with international law, and see the right to stop work in a good faith <b>trade</b> <b>dispute</b> as an implied term in every employment contract. On the other hand, differently composed courts have asserted that the common law position sits at odds with international law: that a strike is a breach of contract, and this creates tortious liability for unions organising collective action, unless it falls within an immunity from statute. On this view, even though an employer is not liable for economic loss to workers who are collectively dismissed, a union could be liable to the employer for taking collective action. Economic torts have been said to include conspiracy to injure, inducement of breach of contract, and tortious interference with a contract. However, TULRCA 1992 section 219 contains the classic formula, that collective action by a trade union becomes immune from any liability in tort if done [...] "in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute". This said, various further hurdles must be jumped for a union to be certain of immunity from employers suing for damages, or an injunction to stop a strike.|$|E
