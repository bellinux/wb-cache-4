50|$|Information {{that must}} be {{provided}} in a form of notification to the superintendent before homeschooling begins includes: the school year, name of parent, and address (<b>telephone</b> is <b>optional),</b> child's birth date, parent signature guaranteeing that the subjects listed in the Ohio Administrative Code are part of homeschooling, outline of the curriculum that the parent plans to cover in the next year, a list of materials (textbooks, etc.) that the parent plans to use, parent signature guaranteeing that the child will be in home education for 900 hours during the upcoming school year, and finally assurance that the home instructor has {{a high school diploma}} or the equivalence of a high school diploma. Parents must also send an academic assessment to the superintendent from the previous school year. The academic assessment report needs to be one of two things: either the results of a nationally normed, standardized test or a written portfolio. The portfolio should include samples of the student’s work. The superintendent must notify the parents within fourteen days of his/her decision.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Ways {{to prevent}} gestational {{diabetes}} mellitus (GDM) remain unproven. We compared {{the impact of}} three lifestyle interventions (healthy eating [HE], physical activity [PA], and both HE and PA [HE+PA]) on GDM risk in a pilot multicenter randomized trial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Pregnant women at risk for GDM (BMI ≥ 29 kg/m 2) from nine European countries were invited to undertake a 75 -g oral glucose tolerance test before 20 weeks' gestation. Those without GDM were randomized to HE, PA, or HE+PA. Women received five face-to-face and four <b>optional</b> <b>telephone</b> coaching sessions, based {{on the principles of}} motivational interviewing. A gestational weight gain (GWG) < 5 kg was targeted. Coaches received standardized training and an intervention toolkit. Primary outcome measures were GWG, fasting glucose, and insulin sensitivity (HOMA) at 35 - 37 weeks. RESULTS: Among the 150 trial participants, 32...|$|R
50|$|Laundry {{facilities}} may {{reside in}} a common area accessible to all building tenants, or each apartment may have its own facilities. Depending on when the building was built and its design, utilities such as water, heating, and electricity may be common {{for all of the}} apartments, or separate for each apartment and billed separately to each tenant. (Many areas in the US have ruled it illegal to split a water bill among all the tenants, especially if a pool is on the premises.) Outlets for connection to telephones are typically included in apartments. <b>Telephone</b> service is <b>optional</b> and is almost always billed separately from the rent payments. Cable television and similar amenities also cost extra. Parking space(s), air conditioner, and extra storage space {{may or may not be}} included with an apartment. Rental leases often limit the maximum number of residents in each apartment.|$|R
5000|$|Somewhat confusingly, COMAND 2.5 (not to be {{confused}} with the much later COMAND-APS NTG2.5) actually refers to the first generation of COMAND systems, introduced on the W220. The [...] "2.5" [...] label seems to refer to the fact that the main COMAND unit for this first generation had a height of 2.5 DIN. This COMAND system had a cassette drive, a built-in CD drive for the navigation map discs, an FM/AM radio tuner, a 4-channel amplifier and external connectors to other systems. The European models used Tele Atlas map discs (CD). Towards the end of 1999, the system was upgraded to use the improved DX type navigation discs. COMAND 2.5 uses a D2B optical bus for connection to the external CD changer, the <b>telephone</b> system, the <b>optional</b> Bose surround sound system and the optional Linguatronic voice control system. The COMAND 2.5 unit was made by Bosch.|$|R
40|$|In 1998, Korea {{adopted an}} <b>optional</b> <b>telephone</b> {{subscription}} scheme (OTSS), under which new or existing subscribers could choose either the old {{or the new}} subscription plan. The main {{difference between these two}} plans is the ratio of the connection fee to the monthly charge. This paper attempts to investigate several policy questions related to the change of the telephone subscription scheme. First, the paper examines the relationship between the telephone subscription scheme and competition in telecommunications, especially local competition. Secondly, we conduct international comparisons of the connection fee and the monthly charge to examine economically efficient fixed rate structures. Finally, after describing how the price levels for the new plan are determined, a consumer choice model is set up in order to predict the number of subscribers who will buy the new plan. The experience of the OTSS in Korea provides various implications for telecommunications policy issues in many countries. Telephone rate structure Competition Discrete choice model...|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} believed that consumers behave irrationally when subscribing <b>optional</b> <b>telephone</b> tariffs. The {{fact that they}} show a strong preference for flat rate options has commonly been interpreted as evidence of irrational behavior since such a choice is believed not to be cost-minimizing ex post in most cases. My results, obtained using {{the data from the}} 1986 Kentucky tariff experiment, contradict these views and provide strong evidence in favour of the rationality of consumers' choices. I found that expectations on future consumption {{play a major role in}} the choice of tariffs but also that consumption forecast errors are more related to the volume of local telephone usage than to any particular demographic profile. More importantly, the evidence shows that there exist important learning effects that induce tariff switching in order to minimize the magnitude of monthly bills even in the short term and responding to very small cost differences. Finally, risk aversion is ruled out as a possible source of consumers' biased taste for flat tariffs. Expectation Bias; Learning; Risk Aversion; Service Switching; Tariff Choice...|$|R
5000|$|The Austin A135 Princess Long Wheelbase Saloon (DS6) and Limousine (DM4) were {{introduced}} in 1952. The automatic transmission and power steering from Princess IV were fitted from 1956. The marque name was changed from Austin to Princess in August 1957, and then to Vanden Plas [...] from July 1960. The long wheelbase models continued to be built by hand in limited numbers as the Vanden Plas 4-Litre Princess Limousine, until 1968. All now being parts of British Leyland, the Jaguar Mark X-based Daimler DS420 was initially produced at the Vanden Plas works in Kingsbury, North London then replaced the Vanden Plas Princess within the new, slightly rationalised range. This had been foreseen in 1966 when British Motor Holdings (BMH) had brought BMC and Jaguar together, and stopped development at Vanden Plas of the potential successor car. The limousine was luxuriously appointed with lots of polished wood, optional mohair rugs and radio with controls in the armrest. Among {{the long list of}} available extras were monograms and a flagstaff. The driving compartment was separated {{from the rear of the}} car by a division with an <b>optional</b> <b>telephone</b> for the passengers to communicate with the driver. The driving seat was finished in leather but the rear seats were trimmed in cloth, the usual arrangement on many luxury cars of the time. Though not as durable as leather, cloth was considered kinder to passengers' clothes. To increase seating capacity two occasional seats could be folded out of the floor.|$|R

Among the 150 trial participants, 32 % developed GDM by 35 - 37 weeks and 20 % achieved GWG < 5 kg. HE women had less GWG (- 2. 6 kg [95 % CI - 4. 9, - 0. 2]; P = 0. 03) and lower fasting glucose (- 0. 3 mmol/L [- 0. 4, - 0. 1]; P = 0. 01) than those in the PA group at 24 - 28 weeks. HOMA was comparable. No significant differences between HE+PA and the other groups were observed. An antenatal HE intervention is associated with less GWG and lower fasting glucose compared with PA alone. These findings require a larger trial for confirmation but support the use of early HE interventions in obese pregnant wome...|$|R
