The consultations have produced favourable responses from the majority of respondents, with several different alignment suggestions being proposed over the years.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second crewman was {{an obvious}} problem with the Mk. XII, {{especially}} as few bombers of the era had enough room for the operator. Working with Henry Braddick, Blackett developed {{a new version of}} the calculator that included aircraft instruments inside the computor, eliminating <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> needle-on-needle matching and completely automating the calculations. After the initial design was complete, Blackett moved onto other matters with RAF Coastal Command, where he continued development of his theories of operational research.|$|E
40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{measure of}} multiple motives (EMMM) is presented. The EMMM enables researchers to make quick exploratory assessments {{of a relatively}} large number of general motives. It includes 14 single-item self-report measures that assess self-control, self-esteem, sensation-seeking, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> acquisition, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> affect, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> cognition, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> meaning, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> power, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> precision, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> self-consistency, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> structure, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> uniqueness, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to belong, and <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to buffer anxiety about death. Each single-item measure is sourced from previously-established psychometric scales. The EMMM’s rationale, development, operationalization, analysis, and exploratory nature are discussed, and evidence is provided <b>for</b> <b>the</b> divergent and convergent validity of its items.

5|$|Donald Cousens Parkway and {{a planned}} {{connection}} with Morningside Avenue form the East Metro Transportation Corridor, originally {{envisioned by the}} province in the 1970s as a six lane municipal expressway. During the mid-1990s, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) conducted studies and identified <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> corridor by 2011. Although York had intended for a continuous alignment, the City of Toronto has opposed the direct connection between Morningside and Donald Cousens Parkway. As a result, it is now proposed to connect Morningside Avenue and Donald Cousens Parkway via a widened Steeles Avenue. However, no timeline has been announced as of 2015.|$|E

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of interpersonal conflicts, <b>needs</b> of <b>the</b> victimized are violated. These needs {{have to be addressed}} in order to achieve reconciliation. Due to <b>the</b> heterogeneity of <b>need</b> categories in scholarly research, we scrutinized which need categories can be empirically identified. 478 participants reported on an experienced interpersonal conflict. They responded to 109 items evaluating <b>the</b> perceived <b>need</b> violation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> conflict they reported on. By means of exploratory factor analysis with a random sub-sample (n 1 = 239), six need categories were extracted. These are <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> respect, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> meaning, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> acceptance, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> pleasure, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> self-efficacy, and <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> safety. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that these <b>needs</b> replicated in <b>the</b> second random sub-sample (n 2 = 239) as well as across sub-samples with people who had experienced an interpersonal conflict of lower severity of transgression (n A = 257) or higher severity of transgression (n B = 221). In addition, each of <b>the</b> <b>need</b> categories mediated <b>the</b> relationship between the severity of transgression and <b>the</b> desire <b>for</b> revenge. Yet, <b>the</b> results <b>for</b> <b>the</b> two <b>need</b> categories “pleasure ” and “safety ” have to be interpreted with caution {{due to a lack of}} scalar invariance.

5|$|In the 1990s, after Estonia regained independence, {{the country}} {{underwent}} a {{restructuring of the}} economy, causing {{the collapse of a}} large part of the heavy industry sector. This collapse led to a decrease in the consumption of electricity and thus a decrease in <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> oil shale that was mined to produce it. Electricity and shale oil export to former Soviet markets largely ceased. Due to a decrease in demand, the Tammiku and Sompa mines closed in 1999 and those at Kohtla and Ahtme closed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The PowerBook100 was {{the first}} PowerBook to {{incorporate}} SCSI Disk Mode, which allowed it {{to be used as}} an external hard disk on a desktop Macintosh. This provided a convenient method for software to be installed onto the PowerBook or transferred to the desktop, without <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 100's optional floppy disk drive. A specialized SCSI cable with a unique connector was required, however, to use any SCSI device on the PowerBook series. A second dedicated cable was required for SCSI Disk Mode. This feature was unique to the 100 until Apple introduced new PowerBooks more than a year later.|$|E

5|$|A routine became {{established}} in which salesmen {{would provide the}} duckers with labels.

By avoiding <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable. By 1870 the duck industry was bringing over £20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year.|$|E
