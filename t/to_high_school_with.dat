25|$|Born in Iași, {{his parents}} were the army officer Vasile Panu and his wife Ana (née Gugora), who was of Bulgarian origin. Vasile, whose family {{originated}} in Vaslui and was reportedly called Brânză, attended a cadets' school in Odessa and rose {{to the rank of}} major. He married Ana in Galați; the couple had four sons and two daughters. George attended primary school at Trei Ierarhi Monastery, followed by the National College. His teachers included Petru Poni, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and Titu Maiorescu, while he was classmates with Alexandru Lambrior and Vasile Conta. He was passionate about history and read well beyond what was expected, and was a devoted admirer of Simion Bărnuțiu, whose ascetic figure he saw several times while the latter was teaching in Iași. From the early days of Junimea literary society, in 1864, he began hearing its lectures. When Alexandru Ioan Cuza was overthrown in 1866, he and other pupils backed the idea of a native prince to reign over the country, rather than the foreign-born one Junimea backed, and eventually personified by Carol I. He subsequently studied at the Literature faculty of Iași University from 1868 to 1870. His professors included Maiorescu, Iacob Negruzzi, Nicolae Ionescu and Gheorghe Mârzescu, and he read widely. Panu's classmates included Lambrior and Calistrat Hogaș, who had also gone <b>to</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>with</b> him.|$|E

500|$|Characters {{making their}} first {{appearance}} on the show in this episode are Wiseguy, Artie, Rainier Wolfcastle (as the fictional action hero McBain), Principal Dondelinger, and Marge’s father. Artie's appearance and body language {{is based on a}} man Silverman went <b>to</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>with</b> named Mark Eisenberg. Silverman said that when he directed the episode, he went through his high school yearbook for character ideas and designs, because Silverman went to high school in the period that the episode is parodying. Wolfcastle's voice and design was based on actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The writers actually invented Wolfcastle for the episode [...] "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?", before [...] "The Way We Was" [...] went into production, but since [...] "The Way We Was" [...] aired before it is still considered his first appearance. The character was originally named McBain, after the film franchise that he stars in. When the film McBain was released in 1991, after the episode had aired, the films' producers refused to allow the show to use the name in future episodes, so the name Rainier Wolfcastle, to represent the actor's real name, was created to use instead. Later, the use of the name McBain returned to the show.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jonathan Collier, who is a huge boxing fan. Knowing that {{the people on the}} {{internet}} would [...] "give them grief", the writers went to a lot of effort to explain how Homer would be able to challenge for the Heavyweight Title. A lot of the scenes involving Homer fighting hobos were pitched by John Swartzwelder. Lucius Sweet is a parody of boxing promoter Don King, and is voiced by Paul Winfield, who had previously played King in HBO's 1995 biopic Tyson. In the script, Sweet was described as [...] "A Don King type who looks and sounds exactly like Don King". The similarity is even pointed out by Homer with the line, [...] "He is exactly as rich and as famous as Don King – and he looks just like him, too!". King was asked to guest star, but turned the part down. Drederick Tatum is a parody of Mike Tyson. The name came from George Meyer, who went <b>to</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>with</b> a boy named Drederick Timmins, which Meyer thought was a cool name. Tatum having done time in prison is a reference to the fact that, {{at the time of the}} episode's production, Tyson had just recently been released from prison after serving three years for rape. Homer is at one point referred to as [...] "The Southern Dandy" [...] as a reference to the old-time boxers and wrestlers who had similar nicknames.|$|E

2500|$|Merkerson {{has often}} been reticent about {{revealing}} what her first name really was (Sharon). On the June 11, 2005, episode of NPR's Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!, she jokingly claimed that the initial [...] "S," [...] "stands for 'Sweet' [...] {{so many people have}} difficulty with Epatha, which is what I prefer to be called". She has legally changed her first name to S. During a segment on the January 31, 2012, episode of The Wendy Williams Show, when questioned about the origin of her name, Merkerson shared that [...] "Epatha" [...] was the name of [...] "a grade-school teacher who was influential in keeping [...] in school." [...] She further went on to clarify that she prefers to be addressed as [...] "Epatha" [...] as opposed to [...] "S. Epatha." [...] But in an interview in 2013 for the Archive of American Television, Merkerson confirmed that the [...] "S" [...] stood for Sharon, adding that [...] "some knucklehead" [...] she had gone <b>to</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>with</b> started telling people what the [...] "S" [...] stood for.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{return from}} a tour in 1993, the band learned that {{management}} at Virgin had shifted, leading to the removal of Jeff Ayeroff and Jordan Harris, who had signed the Wallflowers to the label. [...] The new executives at Virgin were not pleased with the Wallflowers' slow sales and the band did not feel they had a future with the label, so they asked {{to be released from}} their contract; Virgin complied {{and by the end of}} the year, the Wallflowers were left without a label. [...] The band went back to playing clubs in Los Angeles and looking for a new label. [...] During this time, the band went through a number of personnel changes. In 1993, Maguire was asked to leave for undisclosed reasons. However, the band would continue playing shows with another bass player, Jimmie Snider, until May 1993, when the band found a permanent replacement. Greg Richling, whom Dylan went <b>to</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>with,</b> became the band's new bassist. Richling remained a member of the Wallflowers for the next two decades, until he left in 2013. The band continued to play club shows in Los Angeles through mid-1994; it was around this time when Yanowitz left the Wallflowers to join 10,000 Maniacs, then fronted by his girlfriend, Natalie Merchant. Shortly after Yanowitz's departure, the Wallflowers caught the attention of Tom Whalley and Jimmy Iovine of Interscope Records, who signed the band in 1995.|$|E

5000|$|Even as the School Committee {{denied any}} {{segregation}} in Boston they supported policies that increased racial imbalance in public schools. Rather than send white students to majority black schools, the Committee constructed portable classrooms at already overcrowded white schools. At South Boston <b>High,</b> an all-white <b>school,</b> enrollment {{was over the}} limit by 676 students during the 1971-72 <b>school</b> year. Girls <b>High,</b> 92% black, was under enrolled by 532 places. [...] Boston's system of feeder schools {{was probably the most}} efficient method of segregation utilized by the Committee. Under this system graduates from middle <b>schools</b> (ending <b>with</b> grade 8) went <b>to</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> <b>with</b> grades 9-12. Graduates from junior <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> (ending <b>with</b> grade 9) went <b>to</b> <b>high</b> <b>schools</b> <b>with</b> grades 10-12. Junior <b>highs</b> tended <b>to</b> be in white neighborhoods while middle schools tended to be in black neighborhoods. [...] As if this system in itself was not enough to prove that segregation existed in Boston, the School Committee incriminated itself by converting two of the largest black junior highs in the city into middle schools for no practical reason. [...] After a decade of protests and arguments and evasions by the Boston School Committee the issue finally came to a head with the 1972 court case.|$|R
