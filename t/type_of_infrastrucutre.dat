Whilst simulation techniques are commonly used to estimate future degradation and service <b>of</b> physical <b>infrastrucutre</b> according to their sensitivity to various environmental parameters (such as depth of high tide, temperature, wetting and drying cycles etc), {{there has been no}} consideration of the altered levels of vulnerability and exposure that will result from a changing climate. This knowledge deficiency also applies to life cycle modelling which provides an important evidence base for divisions affecting the protection and mainenance of different forms of sea{{port infrastructure}}s. This project explores the effects of climate change on structural resilience of seaports. Main activities comprise of three components: (a) Mapping and characterising the vulnerability of different port infrastructure according to a system hierarchy; (b) undertaking detailed predictive modelling of the deterioration of key infrastructure (software models plus 3 D visualisation capacity to allow strategic targeting of hot spots); (c) developing resilience metrics and development of composite resilience indices...|$|R

The learning models compared were the cooperative learning model of the Group Investigation with scientific approach (GI-S), the cooperative learning model of the Think Pair Share with scientific approach (TPS-S), and model of classical learning with scientific approach (K-S). The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> {{the research}} was a quasi experimental research with the factorial design of 3 x 3. The population were all students of Junior High School in Bantul regency on academic year 2014 / 2015. The samples of the research were taken by using the stratified cluster random sampling. The instruments used were mathematics achievement test and questionnaires of AQ. The hypotheses of the research were analyzed by using the two-way analysis of variance with unbalanced cells at the significance level of. The results of the research are as follows. 1) GI-S gives better mathematics achievements than TPS-S, and both gives better mathematics achievements than K-S. 2) Students with AQ <b>type</b> <b>of</b> climber have better mathematics achievements than students with AQ <b>type</b> <b>of</b> camper and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> quitter, while students with AQ <b>type</b> <b>of</b> camper have better mathematics achievements than students with AQ <b>type</b> <b>of</b> quitter. 3) For GI-S and TPS-S, students with AQ <b>type</b> <b>of</b> climber and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> camper have the same mathematics achievements, and students with AQ <b>type</b> <b>of</b> climber and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> camper gives better mathematics achievements than students with AQ <b>type</b> <b>of</b> quitter.
