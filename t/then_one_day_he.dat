Anthony went to Fayyum and confirmed the brethren there in the Christian faith before returning to his fort.|$|E

50|$|Khawaja Shahudin's {{life changed}} rapidly after {{pledging}} spiritual allegiance from Syed Asgar Ali.

Only urge in his life was to get the objective of life that is recognition of Allah. The only place of tranquility was the palace of Syed Asgar Ali.

This state persisted for a number of years, <b>then</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> when <b>he</b> was sitting on roadside while returning from the court of his Murshad he heard the vociferation.

Or else, it was: 'May I tell you about St. Theresa?' or 'St. Stephen, the first martyr--you know about him, don't you?' Kuno simply wouldn't listen at first. It seemed so fantastically irrelevant, such an absurd interruption to his thoughts, his serious, despairing thoughts about the future.

The woman had lost her head about him. And he had only four days now--four days in which to tap the tumultuous love power, to canalise it, to set it working for his escape.
