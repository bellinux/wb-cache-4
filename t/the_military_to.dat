However, {{when they learned}} of the difficulties that blue-ticket holders faced in civilian life, they urged <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>to</b> discontinue the practice. William C. Menninger, {{who served as the}} Director of the Psychiatry Consultants Division for the Surgeon General of the United States Army from 1944 to 1946, tried to persuade <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>to</b> issue honorable discharges to gay service members who had not committed any crimes during their military service.|$|E

5|$|Also, {{electrical}} {{lines and}} drinking water supplies were cut in La Paz. Also, communication lines were extensively damaged. The La Paz airport received damage during the hurricane; however, by {{the afternoon of}} October1, the airport re-opened, thus allowing <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>to</b> provide much-needed aid to victims. Wood, tarpaper, and cardboard were all scattered throughout La Paz. By October 2, rescue teams had covered 38sqmi (100sqkm) to configure the damage.

5|$|Camouflage is the {{concealment}} {{of animals}} or objects of military interest by {{any combination of}} methods that helps them to remain unnoticed. This includes the use of high-contrast disruptive patterns as used on military uniforms, but anything that delays recognition {{can be used as}} camouflage. Camouflage involves deception, whether by looking like the background or by resembling something else, which may be plainly visible to observers. This article lists methods used by animals and <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>to</b> escape notice.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Grant's {{casualties}} in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, {{but it was never}} issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>to</b> seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.|$|E

5|$|Preparations for the {{disposal}} of equipment began {{in the second half}} of 1944 when the War Cabinet directed <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>to</b> survey all stocks and indicate any surpluses. General Thomas Blamey, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, hindered these preparations as he believed they were premature and that the Army's stocks needed to be maintained until Japan was defeated. This position was opposed by the acting Minister for the Army, and the RAAF and RAN made some attempts to identify their surpluses, but was successful in delaying the Disposal Commission's work until July 1945. As a result, relatively little military equipment was sold between September 1944 and June 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Mongols sought {{alliances with}} other nations and {{societies}} to ensure the flow of trade through the empire. The Mongol army was also used to reshape and streamline the flow of trade through the continent by destroying cities on the less-important or more inaccessible routes.

Not long afterwards, news reached him that Yonko had not joined the insurgents {{but had been}} robbed, spending the night at his son's grave in Peterongan in depression. This revitalised Visscher, who retook command of the military on 4 May and ordered everyone {{to return to their}} homes. Several days afterwards, four regents– Suradiningrat from Tuban, Martapura from Grobogan, Suradimenggala from Kaliwungu, and Awangga from Kendal– arrived at Semarang, reporting that the 6,000 promised troops were on their way.|$|E
5|$|Washington, {{alarmed by}} what {{appeared}} to be an armed insurrection in Western Pennsylvania, asked his cabinet for written opinions {{about how to deal with}} the crisis. The cabinet recommended the use of force, except for Secretary of State Randolph who urged reconciliation. Washington did bothhe sent commissioners to meet with the rebels while raising a militia army. When the final report of the commissioners recommended the use of <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>to</b> enforce the laws, the president invoked the Militia Law of 1792 to summon the militias of Pennsylvania, Virginia and several other states. The governors sent the troops and Washington took command as Commander-in-Chief, marching into the rebellious districts.|$|E
5|$|Written {{during the}} Japanese {{occupation}} of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), while Pane was {{an employee of the}} Cultural Centre in Jakarta, Kami, Perempuan is similar to contemporary plays owing to its openly pro-Japanese message and emphasis on everyday issues experienced by average people. Discussions of the play have found it to be pro-Japanese propaganda, suggesting that men should join <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>to</b> please their women, though it has also been suggested that the play is in fact a warning against accepting the Defenders of the Homeland as being for Indonesia. Kami, Perempuan was performed numerous times in 1943, and its script has been compiled in a book.|$|E

5|$|A month later, Gangstas in Space was released. In three missions, players {{continue}} the Saints Row: The Third {{story in a}} new arc about the Gangstas in Space film referenced in the main story. In the game, the film about the Saints is being directed by the self-interested Hollywood director Andy Zhen and the player is acting the final scenes of the film alongside a female co-star making her debut. In the first level, the player fights <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>to</b> save a female alien and controls the turret on the getaway vehicle. In the second, the player is in a shootout in a linear map. The last mission has the player in an aircraft fighting other aircraft while the co-star uploads viruses to transmitters. At the time of review, the player could not revisit the old missions to earn missed achievements, but was later patched. Costumes and vehicles are unlocked upon completing the pack. The pack was released in North America on February 21, 2012, and in Europe the next day.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, Tampico {{was left}} without power or communications. About 15,000people became {{homeless}} {{due to the}} storm, or previously from Hurricane Gladys. The governor of Tamaulipas {{declared a state of}} emergency and requested assistance from <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>to</b> provide food and shelter. Within a day after the storm, water access was restored, although the city initially remained without power or telephone. Communications were cut to Tampico, except for the airport at the radio. The rail line from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City was cut during the storm, but was restored ten days later. Due to ongoing flood conditions, there was an outbreak of dysentery that killed two children. The Mexican government flew medical supplies, food, and clothing from Mexico City to Tampico, while four United States helicopters assisted in rescue missions along the Pánuco River. About 10days after Hilda struck Tampico, Hurricane Janet affected the same area, causing further damage and deaths. Collectively, the two hurricanes caused 1,240deaths along their paths, and damage from the consecutive storms totaled about half of Mexico's 1955 national budget. After the two hurricanes, the Mexican government and military worked to assist the affected residents, and the Mexican Red Cross provided vaccinations and medical assistance to prevent the spread of disease.|$|E
5|$|As Southern {{states were}} subdued, {{critical}} decisions {{had to be}} made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>to</b> ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.|$|E
