25|$|In 1962, GM {{introduced}} the first <b>turbo</b> <b>charged</b> engine {{in the world}} for a car in the Oldsmobile Cutlass Turbo-Jetfire.|$|E
25|$|A <b>turbo</b> <b>charged,</b> liquid cooled, multi-fuel {{diesel engine}} is used, which can develop 510bhp. The vehicle has eight-wheel drive {{and has an}} {{automatic}} reversible hydro mechanical transmission, which is capable of providing different speeds to {{each side of the}} vehicle. Duplicated electrical and compressed air engine start systems are also used. The wheels are utilized with independent torsion-bar suspension and the traverse arms have high capacity telescopic hydraulic shock absorbers.|$|E
25|$|Similar to the Impreza that Team Cusco ran in {{previous}} years until 2008, a Legacy grand tourer car based on the fifth generation model has been built by R Sport for the Japanese Super GT series (GT300 class). It features a boxer-4 <b>turbo</b> <b>charged</b> engine. The car had also featured all-wheel-drive in the first season but the layout was replaced with an FR layout in 2010, which that season they got their first win in 39th Pokka Summer Special.|$|E

25|$|The first Supra Turbo was {{introduced}} in 1987. The inter-cooled, <b>turbo</b> <b>charged</b> version of the 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder engine boosted power to 230hp (172kW; 233 PS) 240lb·ft (325 N·m). The Turbo model also included an engine oil cooler and integrated rear spoiler. The sports package, which was standard on the Turbo and optional on the base model, included a limited slip differential (LSD), TEMS, and headlamp washers. A new Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) was optional on both models. Also in 87 a new beige/tan color combination was implemented, and only 1000 models were produced with this scheme. Toyota installed its variable induction technology into the DOHC twin turbo 1G-GT called T-VIS and also included it into the 7M-GT engine as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} was a <b>turbo</b> <b>charged</b> shootout as both teams scored {{on all three}} of their possessions. Kansas City started it off with an 11-play, 80-yard drive in which quarterback Joe Montana, playing in his last NFL game before {{retirement}} completed all six of his passes, the last a 1-yard touchdown toss to tight end Derrick Walker. Miami responded with a 10-play, 72-yard drive including an 18-yard reception by Irving Fryar, who lateraled the ball to James Saxon for an additional 9-yard gain to the Kansas City 1. Bernie Parmalee ran the ball across the goal line from there, tying the game with 2:20 {{left in the first}} quarter. However, it took just four plays for Kansas City to retake the lead at 14-7 with Montana's 57-yard touchdown pass to running back Kimble Anders.|$|E

30|$|General issues {{regarding}} gas engine development and {{presentation of the}} whole gas engine portfolio from one OEM, has been reported amongst others by Nylund (2004); Nylund and Ott (2013); Portin (2010). The logical step to take for future products would be to implement 2 -stage <b>turbo</b> <b>charging</b> systems also on gas engines as done by other OEM’s (Laiminger et al. 2011; Trapp et al. 2013. Test results from natural gas operated engines in combination with high-pressure <b>turbo</b> <b>charging</b> and early intake valve closure timings (Miller cycles) for evaluation of the technology potential on both spark- and diesel-pilot ignited engine types were presented by Monnet et al. (2014) and in 2015 new gas engine products implementing 2 -stage <b>turbo</b> <b>charging</b> systems were released from different OEM’s (MAN 2015; Wärtsilä 2 2015).|$|R

2500|$|Version 1.0 was {{the first}} full release of Kerbal Space Program. It was nicknamed We Have Liftoff! and {{released}} on 27 April 2015. Version 1.0 completely overhauled the flight and drag model for a more realistic simulation, now ignoring drag on rocket parts which were occluded from air flow. It also allowed for body lift, so that parts that were not specifically designed as wings (such as structural panels) could still generate lift. 1.0 added shock heating and heat shields, making atmospheric entry much more dangerous, as well as air brakes and procedurally generated fairings. All parts received internal modeling. Resource mining was added to refine into fuel or monopropellant. 1.0 also brought several improvements to Kerbals, who could now have various specializations. For example, [...] "Engineer" [...] Kerbals are able to repair wheels and landing legs. Female Kerbals were also added to the game. Version 1.1, nicknamed <b>Turbo</b> <b>Charged,</b> was released on 19 April 2016, almost {{one year after the}} last major update. The game engine was upgraded from Unity 4 to Unity 5, resulting in a massive increase in performance, as well as a stable 64-bit client, removing memory constraints caused by too many mods being installed. Much of the game was rewritten to accomplish this.|$|E
