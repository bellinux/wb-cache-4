25|$|During the 1990–91 Gulf War, the {{shortage}} of military GPS units caused many troops and their families to buy readily available civilian units.

25|$|In all of this, the {{flagship}} of Don Fadrique had entirely managed {{to pass through}} the enemy formation, and turning back toward the convoy, he decided to launch his ship against two other Dutch naos, and soon sent down and pay one of them, while the second could ignite. But the fire soon spread to his own ship and he ordered to <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> and then return to the battle approaching his ships by the weather side, again not to fear the spread.|$|E
50|$|It seems {{impossible}} {{to answer this}} question. It cannot be on, because I did not ever <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> on without at once <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> <b>It</b> cannot be <b>off,</b> because I did {{in the first place}} <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> on, and thereafter I never <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> without at once <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> on. But the lamp must be either on or off. This is a contradiction.|$|R

25|$|A {{panel of}} The Heart Rhythm Society, a {{specialist}} {{organization based in}} Washington, DC {{found that it was}} legal and ethical to honor requests by patients, or by those with legal authority to make decisions for patients, to deactivate implanted cardiac devices. Lawyers say that the legal situation is similar to removing a feeding tube, though there is currently no legal precedent involving pacemakers in the United States of America. A patient in the United States is thought to have a right to refuse or discontinue treatment, including a pacemaker that keeps him or her alive. Physicians have a right to refuse to <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> but are advised by the HRS panel that they should refer the patient to a physician who will. Some patients believe that hopeless, debilitating conditions, like those brought on by severe strokes or late-stage dementia, can cause so much suffering that they would prefer not to prolong their lives with supportive measures, such as cardiac devices.|$|E
500|$|The One’s {{industrial}} design and camera were also praised by both CNET (who gave the phone a 4 out of 5) and PC Magazine (who gave the phone an Excellent rating); however, PC Magazine criticized {{the inability to}} properly perform digital cropping and zooming on images taken with the camera, along with the non-removable [...] "bloatware" [...] applications added by AT in its version. CNET panned BlinkFeed for its lack of content sources and {{for not being able}} to use custom sources or <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> completely, but praised the updates to Sense and the TV app. Again, the [...] "bloatware" [...] added by Sprint and AT was criticized, but HTC’s placement of carrier apps in their own separate folder in the application drawer was noted.|$|E

500|$|Despite these {{regional}} differences, Hampton credits Illmatic {{with providing}} a common artistic ground for rappers on the West Coast and East Coast rap scenes. In the 2009 essay [...] "Born Alone, Die Alone," [...] she recounts the album's impact on West Coast artist, Tupac Shakur. While {{working as a}} journalist for The Source in 1994, Hampton covered three court cases involving Tupac. Around this time, she received an advance-copy of Illmatic and immediately dubbed a cassette version for Tupac, who became [...] "an instant convert" [...] of the album. The next day, she writes, Tupac [...] "arrived in his assigned courtroom blasting Illmatic so loudly that the bailiff yelled at him to <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> before the judge took his seat on the bench." [...] In her essay, Hampton implies that Nas' lyricism might have influenced Tupac's acclaimed album, Me Against the World, which was recorded that same year.|$|E
500|$|Lyricist and {{composer}} Jeffrey Comanor recorded [...] "We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again" [...] for the album A Rumor in His Own Time, which debuted in September 1976. Produced by John Boylan and released on Epic Records, both the album {{and the single}} failed to chart. [...] "We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again" [...] describes a couple that spends a night together, one which the narrator wishes [...] "would never end". Comanor, who wrote the song, stated that his lyrical inspiration originated from a girl he dated who owned a wooden KLH radio that continued to play music quietly when he attempted to <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> When Comanor's next girlfriend, Molly, left the city where he lived, he remembered their last night together and how he [...] "hated that night to end": {{a combination of the}} two memories formed the introductory lyrics of the song.|$|E
500|$|Batman subdues the Joker {{and tells}} him that Gordon survived the Joker's torments, and {{suggests}} that the Joker is alone in his madness. He attempts {{to reach out to}} the Joker and offers to help him recover in order to end their everlasting war, which Batman fears may one day result in a fight to the death. The Joker declines, saying it is too late..."far too late". He then says that this situation reminds him of a joke about two inmates in a lunatic asylum who try to escape. One inmate jumps across a narrow gap between the asylum and the adjoining building, but the other is afraid he will fall. The first inmate offers to shine his flashlight across the gap so the other can walk across it, but the second inmate replies, [...] "What do you think I am, crazy? You'd <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> when I was halfway across!" [...] Batman chuckles at the punch line, and the two old foes laugh as the police arrive.|$|E

500|$|When Kirk and Spock are {{traveling}} {{on a public}} bus, they encounter a punk rocker blaring his music on a boom box, to the discomfort of everyone around him. Spock takes matters {{into his own hands}} and performs a Vulcan nerve pinch. Part of the inspiration for the scene came from Nimoy's personal experiences with a similar character on the streets of New York; [...] " [...] by the arrogance of it, the aggressiveness of it, and I thought if I was Spock I'd pinch his brains out!" [...] On learning about the scene, Kirk Thatcher, an associate producer on the film, convinced Nimoy to let him play the role; Thatcher shaved his hair into a mohawk and bought clothes to complete the part. Credited as [...] "punk on bus", Thatcher (along with sound designer Mark Mangini) also wrote and recorded [...] "I Hate You", the song in the scene, and it was his idea to have the punk—rendered unconscious by the pinch—hit the stereo and <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> with his face.|$|E

50|$|Consider a lamp with a toggle switch. Flicking {{the switch}} once turns the lamp on. Another flick will turn the lamp off.

At the end of one minute, he <b>turns</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> At the end of another half minute, he <b>turns</b> <b>it</b> on again. At the end of another quarter of a minute, he <b>turns</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> At the next eighth of a minute, he <b>turns</b> <b>it</b> on again, and he continues thus, flicking the switch each time after waiting exactly one-half the time he waited before flicking it previously. The sum of this infinite series of time intervals is exactly two minutes.|$|R

2500|$|Season 6, the final, follows two timelines. In {{the first}} timeline, the {{survivors}} {{are sent to}} the present day, as the death of Jacob allows for his brother, the Man in Black, the human alter-ego of the Smoke Monster, {{to take over the}} island. Having assumed the form of John Locke, the Smoke Monster seeks to escape the island and forces a final war between the forces of good and evil. The second timeline, called [...] "flash-sideways" [...] narrative, follows the lives of the main characters in a setting where Oceanic 815 never crashed, though additional changes are revealed as other characters are shown living completely different lives than they did. In the final episodes, a flashback to the distant past shows the origins of the island's power and of the conflict between Jacob and the Man in Black, who are revealed to be twin brothers, with Jacob desperate to keep his brother from leaving the island after he is transmogrified by the power of the island and becomes the Smoke Monster. In this season, we finally discover Jacob's machinations: everyone was pushed by fate and his manipulation to be on the Oceanic flight as many {{of the members of the}} flight were deemed [...] "candidates" [...] by Jacob to be the new protector of the island after his passing. The Man in Black's mission since the beginning of the series: kill all of the candidates, thereby allowing him to leave the island once and for all. The ghost of Jacob appears to the last-of-the-surviving candidates, and Jack is appointed as the new protector. Jack catches up with The Man In Black, who says that he wants to go to the [...] "heart of the island" [...] to <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> and, therefore, finally leave the island. They reach the place, but after doing this, The Man In Black becomes mortal. The Man In Black is killed by Kate, but Jack is seriously injured. Hurley, one of the survivors, becomes the new caretaker of the island. Several of the survivors die in the conflict or stay on the island, and the remaining escape in the Ajira Plane once and for all. Jack returns to the [...] "heart of the island" [...] and turns it on again, saving it. Hurley, as the new protector, asks Ben to help him in his new job, which he agrees. After having saved the island, Jack dies peacefully in the same place in which he woke up when he arrived on the island. The series finale reveals that the flash-sideways timeline is actually a form of limbo in the afterlife, where some of the survivors and other characters from the island are reunited after having died. In the last scene, the survivors are all reunited in a church where they [...] "move on" [...] together.|$|E
