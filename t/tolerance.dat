5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that <b>tolerance</b> to therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. <b>Tolerance</b> develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with <b>tolerance,</b> depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety. This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because <b>tolerance</b> to benzodiazepine sedating effects develops more quickly than does <b>tolerance</b> to brainstem depressant effects, those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients with anxiety disorders and PTSD have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making <b>tolerance</b> to therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E

5|$|If morning {{cortisol}} {{levels are}} over 500nmol/l, ACTH deficiency is unlikely, whereas a level less than 100 is indicative. Levels between 100-500 require a stimulation test. This, too, {{is done with}} the insulin <b>tolerance</b> test. A cortisol level above 500 after achieving a low blood sugar rules out ACTH deficiency, while lower levels confirm the diagnosis. A similar stimulation test using corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is not sensitive enough {{for the purposes of}} the investigation. If the insulin <b>tolerance</b> test yields an abnormal result, a further test measuring the response of the adrenal glands to synthetic ACTH (the ACTH stimulation test) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Stimulation testing with metyrapone is an alternative. Some suggest that an ACTH stimulation test is sufficient as first-line investigation, and that an insulin <b>tolerance</b> test is only needed if the ACTH test is equivocal. The insulin <b>tolerance</b> test is discouraged in children. None of the tests for ACTH deficiency are perfect, and further tests after a period of time may be needed if initial results are not conclusive.|$|E

5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} dependence {{occurs in}} {{about one-third of}} individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results in <b>tolerance</b> and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce <b>tolerance</b> and a withdrawal syndrome {{in a matter of}} days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. <b>Tolerance</b> and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|E

They produced new cultivars that had greater cold <b>tolerance,</b> especially in the spring, ripened earlier and more evenly and had greater fungal disease resistance. Frost <b>tolerance</b> was improved by selecting for late flowering and genetic research identified genes involved in resistance to gall mite and the blackcurrant reversion virus.

The cultivar 'Ben Hope' was released in 1998 with increased <b>tolerance</b> to gall mite, and in the same year, 'Ben Gairn' became available. It shows resistance to the reversion virus. For gardeners and the pick-your-own market, 'Ben Sarek', 'Ben Connan' and 'Big Ben' were introduced and have large, sweet berries. The cultivars 'Ben Connan', 'Ben Lomond' and 'Ben Sarek' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. and new varieties are being developed continually to improve frost <b>tolerance,</b> disease resistance, machine harvesting, fruit quality, nutritional content and fruit flavour.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of <b>tolerancing</b> methods is {{to limit the}} variations of a characteristic while trying to minimize the cost of realization. Traditionally expressed {{in the form of}} an interval (min, max), it can also be expressed in a different form as in the case of inertial <b>tolerancing.</b> The principle of inertial <b>tolerancing</b> consists of <b>tolerancing</b> the mean square deviation in relationship to the target. This new <b>tolerancing</b> method has many properties that the property of additivity of the mean square deviation offers. However, when several characteristics are added to give a resulting characteristic, it leads to a significant tightening of the variations around the target in the case of a process with a small dispersion. Our proposal consists of defining a new alternative of inertial tolerancing: weighted inertial <b>tolerancing.</b> Its goal is to obtain the best possible compromise between statistical <b>tolerancing</b> and worst-case <b>tolerancing</b> method. One will be able to use it when it is not useful to guarantee an inertia on the resulting characteristic, but simply to limit the variations compared with the target...|$|R

25|$|<b>Tolerance</b> to the {{anticonvulsant}} {{effects of}} clonazepam occurs in both animals and humans. In humans, <b>tolerance</b> to the anticonvulsant effects of clonazepam occurs frequently.

In general, short-term therapy is more effective than long-term therapy with clonazepam for the treatment of epilepsy.
