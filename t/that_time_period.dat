5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the United States posed a grain embargo upon the Soviet Union. This {{was an attempt}} by the U.S. utilize food power, however, it was not confirmed. The Soviets thus {{imported}} grain from different suppliers, leading to an increase in grain imports during <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>period,</b> only at a higher cost. Another unsuccessful embargo food power attempt was imposed by the UN Security Council in 1990 with Iraq.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the year}} 1850, the Kalapuya {{numbered}} between 2,000 and 3,000 and were distributed among several groups. These figures are only speculative; {{there may have}} been as few as eight subgroups or as many as 16. In <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>period,</b> the Clackamas' tribal population was roughly 1,800. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the Chinook population was nearly 5,000, though not all of the Chinook lived on the Willamette. The Chinook territory encompassed the lower Columbia River valley and significant stretches of the Pacific coast on both {{the north and the south}} side of the Columbia's mouth.

5|$|By 1500UTC on September 27, the National Hurricane Center {{declared}} Bonnie extratropical, {{since it}} was losing tropical characteristics. Bonnie re-acquired tropical characteristics, and the National Hurricane Center resumed advisories on the storm by 2100UTC on September 28. However, post-analysis indicated that Bonnie remained tropical during <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>period.</b> Bonnie re-strengthened to a strong tropical storm before vertical wind shear weakened it while approaching the Azores. Shortly before becoming extratropical on September 30, Bonnie passed through the Azores as a moderately weak tropical storm. One location in the Azores reported tropical storm force winds. In addition, one man {{was killed by a}} rock fall on the island of São Miguel. No damage was reported in association with Bonnie.|$|E
5|$|By 3 May 1975, North Vietnamese forces {{controlled}} all of South Vietnam, just 55 {{days after}} opening their attack on Buôn Ma Thuột. During <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>period,</b> {{an army of}} approximately three-quarters of a million men was defeated by a force one-fourth its size. Since {{the end of the}} war, there has been much historical recrimination and discussion as to how and why such a lopsided victory had occurred. Four main lines of thought have remained particularly viable, all of which possess some validity, but all are also open to argument.|$|E
5|$|Each guest's {{positioning}} in {{the painting}} has its own meaning.

In the middle there is the bride dancing with an older man, her father. On the right of the work, there is a musician playing on a pijpzak, who is watching the dance from the side. Judging by the writing utensils hanging on his belt, he is a writer or possibly a middle-class painter. Behind him is a hanging tablecloth decorated with a crown and beneath it is the bride's table. Before her table, money collectors can be seen digging trenches while the wedding guests sit down and eat.|$|E

The populations of Mifflin and Mifflintown are the only administrative divisions in the county whose populations decreased in <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>period</b> (at a rate of -7.42% and -3.7%, respectively). However, between 2000 and 2005, eight administrative divisions experienced decreasing populations.

5|$|The {{history of}} the domesticated sheep goes back to between 11000 and 9000 BC, and the {{domestication}} of the wild mouflon in ancient Mesopotamia. Sheep are among the first animals to have been domesticated by humans, and {{there is evidence of}} sheep farming in Iranian statuary dating to <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>period.</b> These sheep were primarily raised for meat, milk, and skins. Woolly sheep began to be developed around 6000 BC in Iran, and cultures such as the Persians relied on sheep's wool for trading. They were then imported to Africa and Europe via trading.|$|E

5|$|The legend {{surrounding}} {{him was that}} he was killed while attempting a rescue; however, this is untrue. Barry retired to Bern, Switzerland and after his death his body was passed into the care of the Natural History Museum of Bern. His skin has been preserved through taxidermy although his skull was modified in 1923 to match the Saint Bernard of <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>period.</b> His story and name have been used in literary works, and a monument to him stands in the Cimetière des Chiens near Paris.

5|$|The {{meeting with}} Fleming led to Hawks's first {{job in the}} film industry, as a prop boy on the Douglas Fairbanks film In Again, Out Again (on which Fleming was {{employed}} as the cinematographer) for Famous Players-Lasky. According to Hawks, a new set needed to be built quickly when the studio's set designer was unavailable, so Hawks volunteered {{to do the job}} himself, much to Fairbanks's satisfaction. He was next employed as a prop boy and general assistant on an unspecified film directed by Cecil B. DeMille.

40|$|AbstractTraditional {{approaches}} to temporal reasoning assume <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> and <b>time</b> spans of events can be accurately represented as intervals. Real-world <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> and events, {{on the other}} hand, are often characterized by vague temporal boundaries, requiring appropriate generalizations of existing formalisms. This paper presents a framework for reasoning about qualitative and metric temporal relations between vague <b>time</b> <b>periods.</b> In particular, we show how several interesting problems, like consistency and entailment checking, {{can be reduced to}} reasoning tasks in existing temporal reasoning frameworks. We furthermore demonstrate that all reasoning tasks of interest are NP-complete, which reveals that adding vagueness to temporal reasoning does not increase its computational complexity. To support efficient reasoning, a large tractable subfragment is identified, among others, generalizing the well-known ORD Horn subfragment of the Interval Algebra (extended with metric constraints) ...|$|R
