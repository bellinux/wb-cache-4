40|$|The use of {{the maximum}} {{rate-of-rise}} of the action potential (Vmax) {{as a measure of}} the sodium conductance in excitable membranes is invalid. In the case of membrane action potentials, Vmax depends on the <b>total</b> <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> across the membrane; drugs or conditions that alter the potassium or leak conductances will also affect Vmax. Likewise, long-term depolarization of the membrane lessens the fraction of <b>total</b> <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> that passes through the sodium channels by increasing potassium conductance and inactivating the sodium conductance, and thereby reduces the effect of Vmax of drugs that specifically block sodium channels.

Here, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to investigate ion and water transport through a 1. 05 -nm-in-diameter monolayer graphene nanopore with its edge charge-modified. From the results, it is found that the nanopores are selective to counterions when they are charged. As the charge amount increases, the <b>total</b> <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> show an increase-decrease profile while the co-ion currents monotonously decrease. The co-ions rejection can reach 75 % and 90 % when the nanopores are negatively and positively charged, respectively.

Besides, the charge modification can enhance the water transport through nanopores obviously. This is mainly due to the ion selection of nanopores.

The hyphal morphology {{of the model}} organism Neurospora simplifies cable analysis of ionic currents to determine current density for quantitative comparisons with ion fluxes. The ion fluxes were measured directly and non-invasively with self-referencing ion-selective microelectrodes. Four ions (H+, Ca 2 +, K+, and Cl–) were examined. H+ net uptake and Ca 2 + net release were small (10. 2 nmol m 22 s 21 and 1. 1 nmol m 22 s 21, respectively) and voltage independent. K+ and Cl – fluxes were larger and voltage dependent. Maximal K+ net release (~ 1440 nmol m 22 s 21) was observed at positive voltages (+ 15 mV), while maximal Cl – net release (~ 905 nmol m 22 s 21) was observed at negative voltage (– 210 mV).

From the experimentally recorded ICAPs before and after treatment of frog skeletal muscle fibres with 4 -AP, approximated by the new function, the ECAPs were calculated applying the linesource model in a finite fibre.

The induced polarization currents are shown in the frequencydomain as a very large voltage-and frequency-dependent capacitance that can be fit by single Debye-type relaxations. In the time domain, the decay phase of the induced currents can be fit by single exponentials. The induced polarization currents can also be observed {{in the presence of}} large sodium andpotassium currents. The presence of the DpA- molecules does not affect the resting potential of the axons, but the action potentials appear graded, with a much-reduced rate of rise. The data in the time domain as well as the frequencydomain can be explained by a single-barrier model where the DpA- molecules translocate for an equivalent fraction of the electric field o £ 0. 63, and the forward and backward rate constants are equal at- 15 mV.

30|$|Generally, {{the change}} in the ionic current will be mainly {{affected}} by two factors: (1) physical place-holding effect. Once IgG molecules enter the nanopores, the volumes in the nanopores are partially occupied, which will prevent certain amounts of K+ and Cl− from passing through PC membrane. It is so-called physical place-holding effect, and it will decrease the background ionic current. (2) Surface charge density of IgG molecule: as we know, the surface charge of IgG molecule will also contribute to the increase of <b>total</b> <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> when it passes through the nanopore. The final current changes will be determined by the combined effects of the above two factors. When the concentration of electrolyte is quite higher, the density of anions and cations in the solution is also higher, and the lost number in anions and cations due to the physical place-holding effect is quite bigger. At the same time, the surface charge density of IgG molecules does not change if the pH of the solution remains at 7.48. In this condition, the decrease in ionic current generated by physical place-holding effect is bigger than the increase due to the contribution of IgG surface charge; so, there will be a decrease blockade in the background ionic current. When the concentration of electrolyte is quite lower, so that the decrease in current generated by physical place-holding effect is smaller than the increase in current due to the contribution of IgG surface charge, there will be an increase blockade in the background ionic current.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In the dark, the ventral {{photoreceptor}} of Limulus exhibits timevariant currents under voltage-clamp conditions; that is, if {{the membrane}} {{potential of the}} cell is clamped to a depolarized value there is an initial large outward current which slowly declines to a steady level. The current-voltage relation of the cell in the dark is nonlinear. The only ion tested which has any effect on the current-voltage relation is potassium; high potassium shifts the reversal potential towards zero and introduces a negative slope-conductance region. When the cell is illuminated under voltage-clamp conditions, an additional current, the light-induced current, flows across the cell membrane. The time course of this current mimics {{the time course of}} the light response (receptor potential) in the unclamped cell; namely, an initial transient phase is followed by a steady-state phase. The amplitude of the peak transient current can be as large as 60 times the amplitude of the steady-state current, while in the unclamped cell the amplitude of the peak transient voltage never exceeds 4 times the amplitude of the steady-state voltage. The current-voltage relations of the additional light-induced current obtained for different instants of time are also nonlinear, but differ from the current-voltage relations of the dark current. The ions tested which have the greatest effect on the light-induced current are sodium and calcium; low sodium decreases the current, while low calcium increases the current. The data strongly support the hypothesis that two systems of electric current exist in the membrane. Thus the <b>total</b> <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> which flows in the membrane is accounted for as the sum of a dark current and a light-induced current...|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{experiments}} {{in which an}} applied electric field translocates polynucleotides through an a-hemolysin protein channel causing ionic current transient blockade, a hybrid simulation model is proposed to predict the conductance properties of the open channel. Time scales corresponding to ion permeation processes are reached using the Poisson–Nernst–Planck (PNP) electro-diffusion model in which both solvent and local ion concentrations are represented as a continuum. The diffusion coefficients of the ions (Kþ and Cl 2) input in the PNP model are, however, calculated from all-atom molecular dynamics (MD). In the MD simulations, a reduced representation of the channel is used. The channel is solvated in a 1 M KCl solution, and an external electric field is applied. The pore specific diffusion coefficients for both ionic species are reduced 5 – 7 times in comparison to bulk values. Significant statistical variations (17 – 45 %) of the pore-ions diffusivities are observed. Within the statistics, the ionic diffusivities remain invariable {{for a range of}} external applied voltages between 30 and 240 mV. In the 2 D-PNP calculations, the pore stem is approximated by a smooth cylinder of radius, 9 A ̊ with two constriction blocks where the radius is reduced to, 6 Å. The electrostatic potential includes the contribution from the atomistic charges. The MD-PNP model shows that the atomic charges are responsible for the rectifying behaviour and for the slight anion selectivity of the a-hemolysin pore. Independent of the hierarchy between the anion and cation diffusivities, the anionic contribution to the <b>total</b> <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> will dominate.

Because several of these <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> are strongly dependent on time, voltage and/or intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +] i), one may argue that the apparent differences in the contribution of a particular <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> to pacemaker activity between SA nodal cell models reflect differences in action potential shape and calcium transient between models rather than intrinsic differences in the <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> of interest.

40|$|International audienceAlthough acetone, in DESI {{ionisation}} generally {{leads to}} protein aggregation, {{in this study}} we report unexpected multi-proton transfers to lysozyme using this aprotic solvent as a charged spray. The DESI/acetone mass spectrum of lysozyme displays (i) {{a significant increase in the}} average charge state (Zav) and (ii) an incomplete H+/Ca 2 + exchange, even though the overall contribution of cationised species is high, relative to those from spraying with a methanol/water solvent. This behavior is contrary to that expected from gas phase basicity, because GBacetone >GBmethanol. Decreasing the amount of sample deposited on the target (from 50 to 0. 050 pmole) leads to a charge state increase, as seen in ESI, but not in the extent of cationisation. Moreover, the DESI signal duration is extended with sprayed acetone even though the <b>total</b> <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> is significantly lowered. With a d 6 -acetone spray, no incorporation of a deuteron occurs, and the ionization yield is strongly decreased for multi-protonated lysoi+ lysozyme. This is in contrast to that observed with a d 4 -methanol spray, which displays a distribution of 48 deuterons in the lyso 9 + ion as shown in high resolution with a LTQ/Orbitrap instrument. This unexpected behavior of the (CD 3) 2 CO spray suggests that protons do not originate from acetone. Furthermore, dry argon post-flow on the target surface results in the lysozyme signal suppression, whereas with a humid argon flow, the signal is regenerated. On the other hand, an argon stream bubbling in heavy water, yields incorporation of several deuterons. The interpretation of this behavior is explained by considering the acetone radical ions at the surface of the primary droplets (and/or offspring droplets and/or at the wet sample surface), being able to react with ambient moisture (or with traces of water adsorbed at liquid phase). Under these conditions, enough protons are produced to generate multi-charged solvated lysozyme aggregates which then become desolvated in the reduced pressure in the skimmer area...|$|E
40|$|Bioelectric {{currents}} {{and the role}} they play in developmental physiology is a major research area actively pursued by researchers over the last century. Key findings in this area have always been related with subsequent advancement in technology which enables sensitive recording of these currents with minimal impact on the biological system. Initially dominated by intracellular electrodes for measuring bulk tissue and then single cell recordings, the Vibrating Probe technique was a significant breakthrough for electrophysiology. Pioneered by Jaffe and Nuccittelli {{around the same time}} that patch clamp technology appeared on the horizon, this technique for the first time allowed non-invasive measurements of current densities associated with small electric fields with high spatial and temporal resolution. This technique was originally developed to measure current densities associated with <b>total</b> <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> traversing a certain extracellular location of a biological cell, tissue or organ immersed in a medium. Widely used for measuring developmental currents on plant cells, embryos, injury {{currents and}} regeneration currents, it has also found widespread application in the corrosion industry. Here, we report for the first time measurement of enormous electric currents (ionic) traversing into the site of injury of guinea pig spinal cords using the 2 -D vibrating probe technology. Time dependent decay of this injury current was measured and the diffusion profile of these ionic currents was also studied. Finally, a biophysical analysis was performed on this data to obtain a mathematical model which predicts the instantaneous surface injury current density. Injury current densities associated with ventral portion of the spinal cord were measured to be higher then those associated with the dorsal portion with the highest being close to 1 mA/cm 2. Additionally the vibrating probe technique was for the first time also applied to characterize the current density profile associated with a MEMS based microelectroporation device. This thesis thus aims to further our understanding of the role of extracellular injury currents in spinal cord injury and regeneration and reviving the vibrating probe technology as an effective tool for developmental biology and other engineering applications. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with the mechanism of growth of porous anodic films formed on high purity aluminium and sputtering deposited aluminium over a wide range of current density between 5 to 50 mA/cm 2 for times up to 5400 s in 24. 5 wt % sulphuric acid and at temperatures of either 0 or 20 0 C. The resultant films were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), optical interferometery, microhardness and nanoindentation. The RBS analysis enabled determination of the composition of the porous films, which was expressed as Al 2 O 3. xAl 2 (SO 4) 3, with the sulphur species content increasing with increase in current density and decrease in temperature. The average expansion factor (expressing, the ratio of the film thickness to the oxidized aluminium thickness) increased between 5 mA/cm 2 and 50 mA/cm 2 for films formed at 0 0 C, extending from 1. 58 to 1. 88 and from 1. 57 to 1. 78 according to SEM and TEM respectively. For films fabricated at 20 0 C, the average expansion factor increased from 1. 45 to 1. 66 and from 1. 42 to 1. 67 derived from SEM and TEM respectively. The expansion factor increases as the current density increases for both temperatures, and decreases as electrolyte temperature for a given current density increases. The increase of expansion factor is also associated with a rise in the steady voltage during film growth. However, the film expansion does not depend on the anodizing time. The increase in expansion factor correlates with a small increase in the amount of sulphur in the film, which increases with rise of current density. The surface of the porous alumina revealed a network of furrows and ridges, reflecting the pattern of the cellular textures on the topography of the elecropolished aluminium. The retention of topography indicates that the thinning of the film due to chemical dissolution by the electrolyte is negligible, although softening of the film toward the film surface increases with rise of electrolyte temperature and anodizing time as determined by microhardness measurements on film cross-sections. For films fabricated at 0 0 C, nodules appeared with a low population density on the film surfaces formed at 20 mA/cm 2 for 5400 s, and a locally high population density, but non-uniform distribution, for films formed at 30 to 50 mA/cm 2 {{for a wide range of}} anodizing times. NRA determined the oxygen concentrations in the films, from which the efficiency of the film grown was derived. The efficiency showed a correlation with the expansion factor, with values increasing with rise of current density and with decrease in the anodizing temperature, ranging from 72 % to 87 % between 5 mA/cm 2 and 50 mA/cm 2, for an electrolyte temperature of 0 0 C, and between 66 % to 75 %, for the same range of current density, for an electrolyte temperature of 20 0 C. The change in the relative film thickness with a change of the anodizing conditions might due to either a rise in the film porosity under a constant efficiency of film growth (assuming a flow model) or an increase in the efficiency of film growth for a constant film porosity (for either a flow or dissolution model), or a combination of the two factors. However, the film expansion appeared to be relatively little dependent on the change of the porosity over selected anodizing conditions. The dependence of the efficiency on the anodizing conditions is possibly associated with a change in the transport number of ion species in the film with a reducing contribution of cation migration to the <b>total</b> <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> with an increase in the current density and in decrease of the anodizing temperature, which correspond to conditions of increasing electric field. The film porosity probably develops by flow of film material underneath the pore base toward the cell wall, as indicated by distribution of tungsten band through the film and distribution of electrolyte species from previous work, with the displaced material enhancing the thickness of the film.

40|$|Electrical {{activity}} in identical neurons across individuals is often remarkably similar and stable over long periods. However, the <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> that determine the electrical activity of these neurons show wide animal-to-animal amplitude variability. This seemingly random variability of individual current amplitudes may obscure mechanisms that globally reduce variability and {{that contribute to}} the generation of similar neuronal output. One such mechanism could be the coordinated regulation of <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> expression. Studying identified neurons of the Cancer borealis pyloric network, we discovered that the removal of neuromodulatory input to this network (decentralization) was accompanied by the loss of the coordinated regulation of <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> levels. Additionally, decentralization induced large changes in the levels of several <b>ionic</b> <b>currents.</b> The loss of coregulation and the changes in current levels were prevented by continuous exogenous application of proctolin, an endogenous neuromodulatory peptide, to the pyloric network. This peptide does not exert fast regulatory actions on any of the currents affected by decentralization. We conclude that neuromodulatory inputs to the pyloric network have a novel role in the regulation of <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> expression. They can control, over the long term, the coordinated expression of multiple voltage-gated <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> that they do not acutely modulate. Our results suggest that current coregulation places constraints on neuronal intrinsic plasticity and the ability of a network to respond to perturbations. The loss of conductance coregulation may be a mechanism to facilitate the recovery of function.

40|$|A {{modeling}} {{algorithm is}} presented to compute simultaneously polymer conformations and <b>ionic</b> <b>current,</b> as single polymer molecules undergo translocation through protein channels. The method {{is based on a}} combination of Langevin dynamics for coarse-grained models of polymers and the Poisson–Nernst–Planck formalism for <b>ionic</b> <b>current.</b> For the illustrative example of ssDNA passing through the α-hemolysin pore, vivid details of conformational fluctuations of the polymer inside the vestibule and β-barrel compartments of the protein pore, and their consequent effects on the translocation time and extent of blocked <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> are presented. In addition to yielding insights into several experimentally reported puzzles, our simulations offer experimental strategies to sequence polymers more efficiently...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe propose an <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> {{model of}} bipolar cells {{based on the}} {{published}} experimental data. Five types of <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> identified in bipolar cell bodies,Ih,IKv,IA,ICa andIK(Ca) were described by a mathematical formulation similar to the Hodgkin and Huxley (Journal of Physiology, 117, 500 – 544, 1952) equations [...] The model parameters were estimated from the voltage clamp data. In simulation, we demonstrate that the present model reproduces not only the voltage clamp responses but also the current clamp responses of the bipolar cells. As a result, the model provides {{a better understanding of}} the functional role of the <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> in bipolar cells in generating the electrical responses...|$|R

40|$|Solid-state nanopores are {{promising}} tools for single molecule detection of both DNA and proteins. In this study, we investigate {{the patterns of}} <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> blockades as DNA translocates into {{or out of the}} geometric confinement of such conically shaped pores. We studied how the geometry of a nanopore affects the detected <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> signal of a translocating DNA molecule over a wide range of salt concentration. The blockade level in the <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> depends on the translocation direction at a high salt concentration, and at lower salt concentrations we find a non-intuitive <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> decrease and increase within each single event for the DNA translocations exiting from confinement. We use recently developed DNA rulers with markers and finite element calculations to explain our observations. Our calculations explain the shapes of the signals observed at all salt concentrations and show that the unexpected current decrease and increase are due to the competing effects of ion concentration polarization and geometric exclusion of ions. Our analysis shows that over a wide range of geometry, voltage and salt concentrations we are able to understand the <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> signals of DNA in asymmetric nanopores enabling signal optimization in molecular sensing applications.

40|$|AbstractFPL 64176 (FPL) is a nondihydropyridine {{compound}} that dramatically increases macroscopic inward current through L-type calcium channels and slows activation and deactivation. To understand the {{mechanism by which}} channel behavior is altered, we compared {{the effects of the}} drug on the kinetics and voltage dependence of <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> and gating currents. Currents from a homogeneous population of channels were obtained using cloned rabbit CaV 1. 2 (α 1 C, cardiac L-type) channels stably expressed in baby hamster kidney cells together with β 1 a and α 2 δ 1 subunits. We found a striking dissociation between effects of FPL on <b>ionic</b> <b>currents,</b> which were modified strongly, and on gating currents, which were not detectably altered. Inward <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> were enhanced ∼ 5 -fold for a voltage step from − 90 mV to + 10 mV. Kinetics of activation and deactivation were slowed dramatically at most voltages. Curiously, however, at very hyperpolarized voltages (<− 250 mV), deactivation was actually faster in FPL than in control. Gating currents were measured using a variety of inorganic ions to block <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> and also without blockers, by recording gating current at the reversal potential for <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> (+ 50 mV). Despite the slowed kinetics of <b>ionic</b> <b>currents,</b> FPL had no discernible effect on the fundamental movements of gating charge that drive channel gating. Instead, FPL somehow affects the coupling of charge movement to opening and closing of the pore. An intriguing possibility is that the drug causes an inactivated state to become conducting without otherwise affecting gating transitions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The peptide 0 ~-agatoxin-IIIA (co-Aga-IIIA) blocks <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> through L-type Ca {{channels}} in guinea pig atrial cells without affecting the associated gating currents, c 0 -Aga-IIIA permits {{the study of}} L-type Ca channel <b>ionic</b> and gating <b>currents</b> under nearly identical ionic conditions. Under conditions that isolate L-type Ca channel currents, 0 ~-Aga-IIIA blocks all <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> during a test pulse and after repolarization. This block reveals intramembrane charge movements of equal magnitude and opposite sign {{at the beginning of}} the pulse (Qon) and after repolarization (Qo~). Qon and Qo ~ are suppressed by 1 ~M felodipine, saturate with increasing test potential, and are insensitive to Cd. The decay of the transient current associated with Qon is composed of fast and slow exponential components. The slow component has a time constant similar to that for activation of L-type Ca channel <b>ionic</b> <b>current,</b> over a broad voltage range. The current associated with Qog decays monoexponentially and more slowly than <b>ionic</b> <b>current.</b> Similar charge movements are found in guinea pig tracheal myocytes, which lack Na channels and T-type Ca channels. The kinetic and pharmacological properties of Qon and Qoer indicate that they reflect gating currents associated with L-type Ca channels. o-Aga-IIIA has no effect on gating <b>currents</b> when <b>ionic</b> <b>current</b> is eliminated by stepping to the reversal potential for Ca or by Cd block. Gating currents constitute a significant component of total current when physiological concentrations of Ca are present and they obscure the activation and deactivation of L-type Ca channels. By using o-Aga-IIIA, we resolve the entire time course of L-type Ca channel <b>ionic</b> and gating <b>currents.</b> We also show that L- and T-type Ca channel <b>ionic</b> <b>currents</b> can be accurately quantified by tail current analysis once gating currents are taken into account...|$|R
