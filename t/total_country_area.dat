40|$|As a {{consequence}} of industrialization during the last centuries, the heavy metal concentration of soils has increased worldwide (Adriano 2001). Hot spots of soil contamination are located in areas of large industrial activities, where surrounding agricultural areas are affected by atmospheric deposition of heavy metals. Also, agricultural practice, e. g. application of sewage sludge or phosphate fertilisers, has lead to increased metal concentration in soils. The extent of the metal contamination in agri-cultural areas is demonstrated by the following examples: In Bulgaria, a survey has revealed that 19 360 ha are contaminated by heavy metals and 1913 ha are polluted by radionuclides.

Mountainous areas are fields of great natural, biological/genetical and cultural wealth, but in their great majority they face numerous environmental and socioeconomic problems. These are mainly abandonment, isolation and population ageing. As for practicing agricultural activities, this is very difficult, because of the intense and intensively changing topographic relief, the fragmentation and dispersion of very small land holdings (ownership/use/exploitation units) and the extreme climate conditions prevailing. In 1975, the European Community announced the first mountain oriented “development ” measure, introducing direct income support for farmers in mountainous areas (European Commission 2002). Since then, important progress has been made not only in dealing, at a theoretical level, with the strategies, policies and measures for the “sustainable ” development of mountainous areas, but also in documenting specific critical views (Dax 2004, Rokos 2004, 2010).

40|$|Number of {{reported}} malaria cases in Mozambique in 2003 5 087 865 Levels {{of access to}} potable water and adequate sanitation facilities in Mozambique are among the lowest in Africa, although the situation has improved somewhat. The problem is most widespread among rural residents, which account for nearly three-quarters of the total population. Access is also lacking in urban slums, which account for 94 per cent of all city dwellers (UN 2007). Natural disasters such as droughts, fl oods, and cyclones frequently strike Mozambique, exacerbating water and sanitation problems, destroying crops, and threatening food security and human health. In 2000, the worst fl oods in over 50 years destroyed 140 000 hectares of crops and affected millions of people (UN 2000). Water Access and Natural Disasters Mozambique has immense agricultural potential, with 36 million hectares of arable land, equivalent to {{almost half of the}} <b>total</b> <b>country</b> <b>area.</b> Fewer than fi ve million hectares are currently being utilized, however, predominantly by poor, smallholder farmers using minimal chemical inputs, irrigation, and machinery (FAO 2005).

40|$|Background and Purpose: In this study, {{estimation}} of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks for the LULUCF categories is provided together with assessment of {{spatial and temporal}} trend of soil carbon density (SCD) for the 1980 – 2006 period in Croatia. Materials andMethods: Calculations of soil carbon stockswas based on data of soil organic carbon from the national (pedon) database of Croatian soils that consisted of 2351 soil profiles and Corine Land Cover inventories in 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2006. Results and Conclusions: The total estimated soil organic carbon stock in Croatia for all CLC categories relevant for the LULUCF sector (93 % of the <b>total</b> <b>country</b> <b>area</b> in 2006) is 618, 77 Mt. Forests and areas with natural vegetation with 348, 11 Mt contribute most of all categories, of which managed forests (broad-leaved, coniferous and mixed) contain 241, 93 Mt and other natural vegetation classes 106, 18 Mt. Estimated soil carbon stock in agricultural land is 270, 46 Mt, of which 166, 99 Mt contain classes of intensive agriculture (arable land, permanent crops and complex cultivation patterns). Total change in SC stock between 1980 and 2006 equals + 1, 91 Mt and is mostly due to changes in agricultural practices in rural areas (abandonment of intensive grazing and conversion of pastures into natural grasslands). Changes in the forestry sector during the considered period were less noticeable but were also present, particularly for broad-leaved forest class (– 2, 73 Mt C). Trends of SC stock changes in LULUCF categories represent good indices of demographic and socio-economic processes in Croatia where three distinctive momentswere evident: (I) decrease of SC stock in the 1980 – 1990 period mostly due to urban sprawl; (II) increase of SC stock in the 1900 – 2000 period due to the decline of agricultural activities in rural areas during and after war period; (III) decline of SC after 2000 due to more intensive urbanization and infrastructural development...|$|E
