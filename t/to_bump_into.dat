25|$|Kidd was {{suspended}} {{for the first two}} games of the season after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor DWI charge stemming from an incident in July 2012. Joe Prunty served as acting head coach for the team's season opener in Cleveland and their home opener against Miami. He made his debut as head coach on November 3 in a loss to the Orlando Magic. On November 5, Kidd had his first victory as head coach in a 104-88 win over the Utah Jazz. On November 28, Kidd was fined $50,000 by the NBA for instructing his player Tyshawn Taylor <b>to</b> <b>bump</b> <b>into</b> him and intentionally spilling a cup of soda on the court in order to stop the game so his team could draw up a last-second offensive play against the Lakers.|$|E

Kyle Busch led the field back to the green flag on the restart, but was passed by Kasey Kahne on lap 14. On lap 34, another caution was given as David Ragan's right front tire was deflating. On lap 40, Kahne led the field to the green flag; on the same lap, the third caution came out when Carl Edwards was clipped by Brad Keselowski and ran up the track <b>to</b> <b>bump</b> <b>into</b> Joey Logano. Also on the same lap, Kyle Busch passed Kahne to steal the lead. Busch then led the field until lap 48, when he was passed again by Kahne.|$|E

500|$|Of Episode 6, The Mirrors Charlie Catchpole wrote [...] "Although I wouldn't want <b>to</b> <b>bump</b> <b>into</b> any {{of these}} people in a wine bar, I found I really cared about their {{unravelling}} relationships, their sad sexual misadventures, their petty jealousies" [...] and concluded by calling the series [...] "Exquisitely written, stylishly produced, superbly performed." [...] In The Times, Paul Hoggart summarised all six episodes as [...] " [...] a tightrope between satire and sentimentality, frequently falling off on the sugary side", but wrote positively of the writing, directing, acting, and editing. He approved of the deliberately unhappy ending, looking forward to seeing how Rachel's departure would be resolved in the second series. Andy Harries attributed the mixed critical reaction to the unusual timeslot the series was given.|$|E
2500|$|Bernie Hobbs, {{a science}} writer with ABC Science Online, {{explains}} why the movie is wrong about quantum physics and reality: [...] "The observer effect of quantum physics isn't about people or reality. It comes from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, and it's about the limitations of trying to measure the position and momentum of subatomic particles... this only applies to sub-atomic particles—a rock doesn't need you <b>to</b> <b>bump</b> <b>into</b> it to exist. It's there. The sub-atomic particles {{that make up the}} atoms that make up the rock are there too." [...] Hobbs also discusses Hagelin's experiment with Transcendental Meditation and the Washington DC rate of violent crime, saying that [...] "the number of murders actually went up". Hobbs further disputed the film's use of the ten percent of the brain myth.|$|E

5000|$|The {{part that}} connects the rails to the seat post {{is known as the}} [...] "saddle clamp". It may be built into the top of the seat post, or the seat post may be {{essentially}} a pipe that provides a cylinder at the top (often ⅞ in / 22.2 mm) for a separate clamp to attach. The upper attachment point must be compatible with the rail configuration (though the two-rail 7 mm round configuration is very common), and the lower attachment point must match the diameter of the seat post if not built in. The shape of some unusual saddles also makes them physically incompatible with certain seat posts, clamps, or frames, due <b>to</b> <b>bumping</b> <b>into</b> other parts or blocking adjustment or attachment bolts.|$|R
60|$|The {{inadequate}} boat {{finally arrived}} at a precarious landing, the natives, waist-deep in the surf, assisting. I was carried ashore, and while the evening meal was being prepared, I wandered to and fro along the rocky, shattered shore. Bits of surf-harried beach clove the worn granite, or whatever the rocks of Cape Farewell may be composed of, and as I followed the ebbing tide down one of these soft stretches, I saw the thing. Were one <b>to</b> <b>bump</b> <b>into</b> a Bengal tiger in the ravine behind the Bimini Baths, one could be no more surprised than was I to see a perfectly good quart thermos bottle turning and twisting in the surf of Cape Farewell at the southern extremity of Greenland. I rescued it, but I was soaked above the knees doing it; and then I {{sat down in the}} sand and opened it, and in the long twilight read the manuscript, neatly written and tightly folded, which was its contents.|$|E
