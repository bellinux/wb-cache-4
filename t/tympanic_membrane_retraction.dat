40|$|Introduction: Cholesteatoma is an {{aggressive}} disease and its management poses a greater challenge in children than in adults. This study reviews {{the experience of}} Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre in the clinical presentation and management outcome of acquired cholesteatoma in paediatrics that required surgical interventions. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of case records of patients below 18 years old who underwent surgery from 1999 to 2010. Results: A total of 46 patients presented with 53 cases of cholesteatoma in which seven patients had bilateral disease. The age of presentation ranged from four to 18 years old {{with a mean age}} of 12 years. Male and female patients were 65 % and 35 % respectively. Otorrhoea or previous history of otorrhoea on presentation was found in 94 % and 96 % of them had hearing impairment. Cerebellopontine angle abscess, sigmoid sinus thrombosis and mastoiditis were among the complications. Tympanic membrane was retracted in 64 % while 47 % having had attic retraction and 53 % had total atelectasis. A majority (85 %) underwent canal wall down surgery with or without tympanoplasty. Post-operatively, 71 % had improvement or preserved hearing level. The duration of follow up ranged from one month to 13 years and a quarter had recurrent disease and underwent revision surgeries. Conclusion: Majority of the cholesteatoma patients suffered from hearing loss and otorrhoea. <b>Tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>retraction</b> remained the most common clinical finding. Hence, children with persistent otorrhoea after adequate treatment may represent cholesteatoma. Surgical options of canal wall up and canal wall down procedures have equal risk of recurrence. ...|$|E

ObjectiveTo evaluate the variation in middle ear pressure in patients with <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>retraction</b> and in normal patients during tube function tests, as well as to evaluate intra-individual variation between these tests. MethodsAn observational, contemporary, cross-sectional study was conducted, in which the factor under study was the variation in middle ear pressure during tube function tests (Valsalva maneuver, sniff test, Toynbee maneuver) in healthy patients and in patients with mild and moderate/severe tympanic retraction. A total of 38 patients (76 ears) were included in the study. Patients underwent tube function tests at two different time points to determine pressure measurements after each maneuver. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software, version 18. 0, considering p-values < 0. 05 as statistically significant. ResultsMean (standard deviation) age was 11 (2. 72) years; 55. 3 % of patients were male and 44. 7 % female. The prevalence of type A tympanogram was higher among participants with healthy ears and those with mild retraction, whereas type C tympanograms were more frequent in the moderate/severe retraction group. An increase in middle ear pressure was observed during the Valsalva maneuver at the first time point evaluated in all three groups of ears (p= 0. 012). The variation in pressure was not significant either for the sniff test or for the Toynbee maneuver at the two time points evaluated (p≥ 0. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{present the}} course of <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> {{pathology}} in childhood and young adulthood after otitis media (OM) in early life. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective follow-up study. SETTING: Community study of a birth cohort. PATIENTS: Three hundred fifty-eight subjects with a positive and negative history of OM (OM+ or OM-) or ventilation tube insertion (VT+ or VT-) derived from a birth cohort that had been followed-up from preschool to adult age. METHODS: Standardized otomicroscopic examination performed at ages 8 and 18 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>Tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> abnormalities (i. e., tympanosclerosis, atrophy, atelectasis and retraction pockets of the pars tensa, and retraction of the pars flaccida). RESULTS: At the age of 8 years, <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> pathology was highly prevalent in the both OM+ subcohorts (OM+VT+, 92 % and OM+VT-, 46 %), whereas in the OM- ears (11 %), <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> abnormalities were rare.

40|$|Background Otitis {{media with}} {{effusion}} (OME), or 'glue ear', {{is very common}} in children, especially {{between the ages of}} one and three years with a prevalence of 10 % to 30 % and a cumulative incidence of 80 % at the age of four years. OME is defined as middle ear effusion without signs or symptoms of an acute infection. OME may occur as a primary disorder or as a sequel to acute otitis media. The functional effect of OME is a conductive hearing level of about 25 to 30 dB associated with fluid in the middle ear. Both the high incidence and the high rate of spontaneous resolution suggest that the presence of OME is a natural phenomenon, its presence at some stage in childhood being a normal finding. Notwithstanding this, some children with OME may go on to develop chronic otitis media with structural changes (<b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>retraction</b> pockets, erosion of portions of the ossicular chain and cholesteatoma), language delays and behavioural problems. It remains uncertain whether or not any of these findings are direct consequences of OME. The most common medical treatment options include the use of decongestants, mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines and antibiotics. The effectiveness of these therapies has not been established. Surgical treatment options include grommet (ventilation or tympanostomy tube) insertion, adenoidectomy or both. Opinions regarding the risks and benefits of grommet insertion vary greatly. The management of OME therefore remains controversial. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of grommet insertion compared with myringotomy or non-surgical treatment in children with OME. The outcomes studied were (i) hearing level, (ii) duration of middle ear effusion, (iii) well-being (quality of life) and (iv) prevention of developmental sequelae possibly attributable to the hearing loss (for example, impairment in impressive and expressive language development (measured using standardised tests), verbal intelligence, and behaviour). Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to 2003), EMBASE (1973 to 2003) and reference lists of all identified studies. The date of the last systematic search was March 2003, and personal non-systematic searches have been performed up to August 2004. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of grommets on hearing, duration of effusion, development of language, cognition, behaviour or quality of life. Only studies using common types of grommets (mean function time of 6 to 12 months) were included. Data collection and analysis Data from studies were extracted by two reviewers and checked by the other reviewers. Main results Children treated with grommets spent 32 % less time (95 % confidence interval (CI) 17 % to 48 %) with effusion {{during the first year of}} follow-up. Treatment with grommets improved hearing levels, especially during the first six months. In the randomised controlled trials that studied the effect of grommet insertion alone, the mean hearing levels improved by around 9 dB (95 % CI 4 dB to 14 dB) after the first six months, and 6 dB (95 % CI 3 dB to 9 dB) after 12 months. In the randomised controlled trials that studied the combined effect of grommets and adenoidectomy, the additional effect of the grommets on hearing levels was improvement by 3 to 4 dB (95 % CI 2 dB to 5 dB) at six months and about 1 to 2 dB (95 % CI 0 dB to 3 dB) at 12 months. Ears treated with grommets had an additional risk for tympanosclerosis of 0. 33 (95 % CI 0. 21 to 0. 45) one to five years later. In otherwise healthy children with long-standing OME and hearing loss, early insertion of grommets had no effect on language development or cognition. One randomised controlled trial in children with OME more than nine months, hearing loss and disruptions to speech, language, learning or behaviour showed a very marginal effect of grommets on comprehensive language. Authors' conclusions The benefits of grommets in children appear small. The effect of grommets on hearing diminished during the first year. Potentially adverse effects on the tympanic membrane are common after grommet insertion. Therefore an initial period of watchful waiting seems to be an appropriate management strategy for most children with OME. As no evidence is yet available for the subgroups of children with speech or language delays, behavioural and learning problems or children with defined clinical syndromes (generally excluded from the primary studies included in this review), the clinician will need to make decisions regarding treatment for such children based on other evidence and indications of disability related to hearing impairment. This review does not resolve the discrepancy between parental and clinical observation of a beneficial treatment effect and the results in the reviewed RCT showing only a short-term effect on hearing and virtually no effect on development. Is the perceived, often dramatic, effect of grommets only a short-term one? Are some children more sensitive to OME-related hearing loss than others? If so, how do we identify them? Further research should focus upon indications. Studies should use sufficiently large sample sizes to show significant interactions. There is a need to determine the most suitable variables and appropriate "softer" outcomes to be the subject of these interaction tests. Interesting options include measures of speech-in-noise and binaural hearing. The generally modest results in the trials which are included in this review should make it easier to justify randomisation of more severely affected and higher-risk children in appropriately constructed trials. Randomised controlled trials are necessary in these children before more detailed conclusions about the effectiveness of grommets can be drawn...|$|E

40|$|Recently {{an attempt}} to repair the {{perforated}} drum has become quite common. However, as regards the questions what histopathological finding could be observed in both the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> and the transplanted graft, and whether such a graft would cover up the perforations to take place of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane,</b> or the graft would play only a role aiding regeneration of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane,</b> there are still no histopathological studies. In order to solve these questions central perforations in pars tensa of the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> of rabbits were made with injection needles and these perforations were repaired by transplanting free skin or buccal mucous membrane graft from the same animals, and the following conclusion were obtained. 1. Of the 14 ears transplanted with free skin graft, in 7 cases (50 %) the transplantation was successful, namely, the free skin graft adhered to the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane.</b> Of 10 ears receiving the transplantation of buccal mucous membrane graft it was successful in two cases. (20 %). 2. By the fifth to sixth day after the transplantation, there could be observed no marked changes in the skin graft or in the buccal mucous membrane graft, and also no fibrous adhesion could be observed between the transplanted graft and the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane.</b> 3. On the seventh day {{it was observed that}} transplantation began to take hold of itself between the transplanted free skin graft or the buccal mucous membrane graft and the <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane.</b> 4. In the case where the transplantation had come to take hold of itself, the epithelium of the mucous <b>membrane</b> of <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane,</b> extending along the interior side of the transplanted graft, closed the perforation, and the submucous tissue of <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane</b> adhered directly to the connective tissue of the skin graft or the buccal mucous membrane graft. 5. When the adhesion takes place, the grafted skin or the buccal mucous membrane loses their morphological characteristics.

It is concluded that either poly-α-amino acid or PTFE with poly-α-amino acid maybe a suitable material for an artificial <b>tympanic</b> <b>membrane...</b>|$|R
