5|$|Toothache, {{also known}} as dental pain, is pain in the teeth and/or their {{supporting}} structures, caused by dental diseases or pain referred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> by non-dental diseases.|$|E
5|$|Grills {{are made}} of several types of metal (often silver, gold or platinum) that are {{sometimes}} inlaid with precious stones; they are generally removable, though some may be permanently attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth.</b> Gold grills {{can be made from}} 10-karat, up to 24-karat gold. The gold can be tinted yellow, white and rose color.|$|E
5|$|From these {{theoretical}} risks, derive {{the real}} world complications. Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or gingiva due to peri-implantitis or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no dental enamel on an implant, it does not fail due to cavities like natural teeth. While large-scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (five to ten years) survival of dental implants at 9398 percent depending on their clinical use. During initial development of implant retained teeth, all crowns were attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> with screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of crowns on the abutments with dental cement (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This has created the potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during cementation to {{get caught in the}} gingiva and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below). While the complication can occur, there {{does not appear to be}} any additional peri-implantitis in cement-retained crowns compared to screw-retained crowns overall.|$|E

5000|$|Bonding {{to tooth}} structure: Composite {{fillings}} micro-mechanically bond to tooth structure. This strengthens <b>the</b> <b>tooth's</b> structure and restores its original physical integrity. The discovery of acid etching (producing enamel irregularities ranging from 5-30 micrometers in depth) of teeth {{to allow a}} micro-mechanical bond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> allows good adhesion of <b>the</b> restoration <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b> Very high bond strengths to tooth structure, both enamel and dentin, can be achieved with {{the current generation of}} dentin bonding agents.|$|R
5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth.</b> Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the Socrates pain assessment method (see table).|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} {{complications that}} result from restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, to the risk factors of {{the patient and the}} technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to biomechanical factors, where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor crown-to-root ratio). Similarly, grinding of the teeth, lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> they are intended to support.|$|E
5|$|The pain pathway {{is mostly}} {{transmitted}} via myelinated Aδ (sharp or stabbing pain) and unmyelinated C nerve fibers (slow, dull, aching, or burning pain) of the trigeminal nerve, which supplies sensation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> and gums via many divisions and branches. Initially, pain is felt while noxious stimuli are applied (such as cold). Continued exposure decreases firing thresholds of the nerves, allowing normally non-painful stimuli to trigger pain (allodynia). Should the insult continue, noxious stimuli produce larger discharges in the nerve, perceived as more intense pain. Spontaneous pain may occur if the firing threshold is decreased {{so it can}} fire without stimulus (hyperalgesia). The physical component of pain is processed in the medullary spinal cord and perceived in the frontal cortex. Because pain perception involves overlapping sensory systems and an emotional component, individual responses to identical stimuli are variable.|$|E

5|$|The gingiva ("gums") is the mucosal {{tissue that}} {{overlays}} the jaws. There are three {{different types of}} epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> and <b>the</b> mouth. The gingival epithelium is not associated directly with tooth attachment and is visible in the mouth. The junctional epithelium, composed of the basal lamina and hemidesmosomes, forms an attachment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b> <b>The</b> sulcular epithelium is nonkeratinized stratified squamous tissue on the gingiva which touches but is not attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tooth-sparing preparation: The {{fact that}} {{composite}} fillings are glued (bonded) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> means that unlike amalgam fillings, {{there is no}} need for <b>the</b> dentist <b>to</b> create retentive features destroying healthy tooth. Unlike amalgam, which just fills a hole and relies on the geometry of <b>the</b> hole <b>to</b> retain <b>the</b> filling, composite materials are bonded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b> In order <b>to</b> achieve <b>the</b> necessary geometry <b>to</b> retain an amalgam filling, the dentist may need to drill out a significant amount of healthy <b>tooth</b> material. In <b>the</b> case of a composite restoration, the geometry of the hole (or [...] "box") is less important because a composite filling bonds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b> Therefore less healthy tooth needs to be removed for a composite restoration.|$|R

25|$|Using a {{drinking}} straw is often advised by dentists as the drink {{does not come}} into as much contact with the teeth. It has also been suggested that brushing teeth right after drinking soft drinks should be avoided as this can result in additional erosion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> due {{to the presence of}} acid.|$|E

50|$|The longer that plaque {{stays on}} <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> surface, <b>the</b> harder and more {{attached}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> it becomes. That {{is when it}} {{is referred to as}} calculus and needs to be removed by a dental professional. If this is not treated, the inflammation will lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bone loss and will eventually lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effected <b>teeth</b> becoming loose.|$|R
25|$|The ICSD-R {{described}} {{three different}} severities of sleep bruxism, defining mild as occurring less than nightly, with no damage to teeth or psychosocial impairment; moderate as occurring nightly, with mild impairment of psychosocial functioning; and severe as occurring nightly, and with damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth,</b> tempormandibular disorders and other physical injuries, and severe psychosocial impairment.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} maxillary teeth were twenty per side, {{lower than the}} number with Stegosaurus. Carpenter {{described}} them as similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> of Stegosaurus, though somewhat larger. Peter Malcolm Galton in 2007 established some differences: there are rough vertical ridges present on {{the upper part of}} the crown, one per denticle; the fine grooves on the tooth surface are weakly developed.|$|E
25|$|A Sulcabrush {{is a type}} of {{toothbrush}} used {{specifically for}} cleaning along the gumline adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth.</b> The bristles are usually shaped in a pointed arrow pattern to allow closer adaptation to the gums. A Sulcabrush is ideal for cleaning specific difficult-to-reach areas, such as between crowns, bridgework and crowded teeth. End-tufted brushes may also be used around fixed orthodontic appliances, such as braces.|$|E

25|$|The tooth-based taxon Aublysodon was {{a mystery}} {{for a long time}} since no further {{skeletal}} elements were found that could be assigned with certainty <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth.</b> In the early twentieth century it was assumed by some workers that it represented a member of the Ornithomimidae when it was not yet known this group was toothless. Lawrence Morris Lambe in 1902 referred the tooth to Struthiomimus; Hay in 1930 renamed A. mirandus into Ornithomimus mirandus, forgetting in that case Aublysodon would have priority.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, Lovie Austin {{decided to}} make Chicago her home, and she lived and worked there {{for the rest of}} her life. She was often seen racing around town in her Stutz Bearcat with leopard skin upholstery, dressed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth.</b> Her early career was in vaudeville, where she played piano and {{performed}} in variety acts. Accompanying blues singers was Lovie's specialty, and can be heard on recordings by Ma Rainey ("Moonshine Blues), Ida Cox ("Wild Women Don't Have the Blues"), Ethel Waters ("Craving Blues"), and Alberta Hunter ("Sad 'n' Lonely Blues").|$|E
25|$|The Bureau of Legal Dentistry {{encourages}} {{the use of}} multiple dental impressions to create a “dental lineup”, similar to a suspect lineup used to identify alleged perpetrators of crime. Currently, dental impressions collected as evidence are compared only to those collected from a given suspect, which may bias the resulting outcome. Using multiple dental impressions in a lineup may enable forensic odontologists to significantly decrease the current bias in matching bite marks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> of a suspect. The organization BOLD also supports the creation of a database of dental records, which could help in verifying dental uniqueness. This database could be created using criminal records or possibly all dental patients.|$|E
50|$|The {{scientific}} name polyodon {{is derived from}} the Greek words poly (much) and odontos (<b>tooth)</b> and refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> shapes along <b>the</b> costa.|$|R
25|$|Dental care – Carbohydrates and sugars usually adhere <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> enamel, where {{bacteria}} {{feed upon}} them and quickly multiply. The bacteria convert <b>the</b> sugar <b>to</b> acids that decay <b>the</b> <b>teeth.</b> Sugar substitutes, unlike sugar, do not erode teeth {{as they are}} not fermented by the microflora of the dental plaque. A sweetener that can actually benefit dental health is xylitol, which tends to prevent bacteria from adhering <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> surface, thus preventing plaque formation and eventually decay. Xylitol cannot be fermented by bacteria that feed on sugar, so they have difficulty thriving, thus helping to prevent plaque formation.|$|R
5|$|Prismatic enamel - The enamel coating on {{the surface}} of a tooth {{consists}} of prisms, solid, rod-like structures extending from <b>the</b> dentin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tooth's</b> surface.|$|R
25|$|Dental plaque is an oral biofilm that adheres <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> and {{consists}} of many species of both bacteria and fungi (such as Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans), embedded in salivary polymers and microbial extracellular products. The accumulation of microorganisms subjects the teeth and gingival tissues to high concentrations of bacterial metabolites which results in dental disease. Biofilm {{on the surface of}} teeth is frequently subject to oxidative stress and acid stress. Dietary carbohydrates can cause a dramatic decrease in pH in oral biofilms to values of 4 and below (acid stress). A pH of 4 at body temperature of 37°C causes depurination of DNA, leaving apurinic (AP) sites in DNA, especially loss of guanine.|$|E
25|$|Later in 2010, {{a second}} {{paper from the}} Svante Pääbo group {{reported}} the prior discovery, in 2000, of a third upper molar from a young adult, dating from {{about the same time}} (the finger was from level 11 in the cave sequence, the tooth from level 11.1). The tooth differed in several aspects from those of Neanderthals, while having archaic characteristics similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> of Homo erectus. They performed mitochondrial DNA analysis on the tooth and found it to have a sequence different from but {{similar to that of the}} finger bone, indicating a divergence time about 7,500 years before, and suggesting that it belonged to a different individual from the same population.|$|E
25|$|Some sources {{consider}} Angaturama {{a synonym}} of Irritator, citing {{the fact that}} the remains of Angaturama allegedly seem to complete Irritators skull (meaning that they could belong to the same specimen). However, substantial objection has been raised to this assertion. Kellner and Campos (2000) and Machado and Kellner (2005) both expressed the opinion that the fossils come from two different genera, and that the fossil of Angaturama was clearly more laterally flattened than Irritator. A review of both fossils by Sales and Schultz (2017) also noted that the specimens differ in other aspects of their preservation: the Irritator specimen is brighter in color; the Irritator speicmen is affected by a vertical crack while the Angaturama specimen bears many cavities; and the damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> of the Irritator specimen is much less severe. They also identified a possible point of overlap, the third left maxillary tooth, and observed that the skull of Angaturama may have been larger than that of Irritator based on the proportions of Baryonyx. Nevertheless, although the two specimens evidently do not belong to the same individual, Sales and Schultz noted that synonymy at the genus level would need to be verified by more extensively overlapping remains. If Angaturama and Irritator are actually regarded {{as a member of the}} same genus, Irritator challengeri would be the valid scientific name under rules of priority.|$|E
50|$|One {{failure mode}} is gradual wear <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> shape, which may {{eventually}} lead to slippage over rounded <b>teeth.</b> <b>The</b> belt often continues <b>to</b> work, but <b>the</b> relative timing between shafts changes.|$|R
