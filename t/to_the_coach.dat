5|$|In March 2000, NSB {{announced}} that they were considering {{reducing the number of}} stations on the commuter rail from the then 31 stations to between 15 and 20. NSB stated that 50% of the stations were responsible for only 2% of the traffic, and that a bus service to these areas—which would transport people to the closest railway station—would be more economic and reduce travel time for the remaining passengers. NSB also stated that they indented to re-brand the service as part of the Puls brand used for the other commuter rail services. Part of the reason for the change of service was that Nord-Trøndelag County Municipality had permitted TrønderBilene to double the number of services on their competing coach service along the route and the commuter rail needed to increase its speed to not lose customers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coach.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sánchez had {{recommended}} Fernández <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> of his alma mater, Fran Dunphy. Dunphy dispatched assistant Matt Langel to recruit Fernández to Temple. On one recruiting trip, Langel drove for 10 {{hours on the}} backroads of Argentina searching for Fernández, who was practicing with the national team instead of home in Rio Tercero as Langel had thought. After his official visit to the Philadelphia campus in September 2008, Fernández signed his letter of intent. He graduated high school in December, and enrolled at Temple.|$|E
5|$|The BBC Sports Personality of the Year Coach Award is {{an award}} given {{annually}} {{as part of}} the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony each December. The award is given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> who was considered to have made the most substantative contribution to British sport in that year. The award is decided by a panel of over 30 sporting journalists. Each panellist votes for their top two choices; their first preference is awarded two points, and their second preference is awarded one point. The winning coach is the one with the largest points total. In the case of a points tie, the person chosen as first preference by the most panellists is the winner. If this is also a tie the award is shared.|$|E

5|$|This {{season ends}} on a cliffhanger {{due to the}} Writers' Strike.

5|$|Parsons' and Cameron's {{relationship}} was deteriorating and they contemplated divorce. While Cameron visited the artistic commune at San Miguel de Allende in Mexico and befriended the artist Renate Druks, Parsons {{moved into a}} house in Redondo Beach and {{was involved in a}} brief relationship with an Irishwoman named Gladis Gohan before Cameron returned. By March 1951, Parsons and Cameron had moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> house at 1071 South Orange Grove, while he began work at the Bermite Powder Company, constructing explosives for the film industry. They started holding parties once more that were attended largely by bohemians and members of the beat generation, and Cameron attended the jazz clubs of Central Avenue with her friend, the sculptor Julie Macdonald. Cameron produced illustrations for fashion magazines and sold some of her paintings, including some purchased by a friend, the artist Jirayr Zorthian. Parsons and Cameron had decided to travel to Mexico for a few months. On the day before they planned to leave—June 17, 1952—he received a rush order of explosives for a film set, and began work on the order at his house. In the midst of this project, an explosion destroyed the building, fatally wounding Parsons. He was rushed to hospital, but was declared dead. Cameron {{did not want to see}} his body and retreated to San Miguel, asking her friend George Frey to oversee the cremation.|$|E

25|$|In 1786 Owen {{moved to}} London, {{where he was}} apprenticed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> painter Charles Cotton, RA (1728–1798).This {{position}} was most likely arranged by his uncle, who was butler to the scholar and art theorist Richard Payne Knight, who lived near Ludlow.

25|$|To {{accommodate}} ever-growing {{rail traffic}} into the restricted Midtown area, Wilgus {{took advantage of}} the recent electrification technology to propose a novel scheme: a bi-level station below ground. Arriving trains would go underground under Park Avenue, and proceed to an upper-level incoming station if they were mainline trains, or to a lower-level platform if they were suburban trains. In addition, turning loops within the station itself obviated complicated switching moves to bring back the trains <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> yards for servicing. Departing mainline trains reversed into upper-level platforms in the conventional way. New track infrastructure allowed maximum train speeds of , as well as a massive four-floor, 400-lever signal tower to control the suburban trains.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 23 June 1949 a fire {{broke out in the}} tenth coach of an express {{passenger}} train from Edinburgh to King's Cross, {{about two and a half}} miles beyond Cockburnspath. The train stopped somewhere near the tunnel, within one and a quarter minutes of the fire starting, but the fire spread rapidly and with such ferocity that, within seconds, the brake-composite carriage was engulfed and the fire had spread <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> in front. Most passengers escaped by running to the guard's compartment or forwards along the corridor, but some were compelled to break the windows and jump down onto the track.

500|$|With the {{departure}} of long-time Canucks captain Markus Näslund to free agency in the 2008 off-season, Mitchell was considered a leading candidate for captaincy.

Mitchell was named alternate captain along with forward Ryan Kesler and defenceman Mattias Öhlund. [...] Due to Luongo's limitations as a goaltender, Mitchell was designated the captain's traditional role of disputing calls by the officials and relaying messages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coach.</b>|$|E

The only major road through Gateshead Fell was that which followed the same route of the ancient turnpike road which ran through what is now Sheriff Hill (today this is Old Durham Road/Sheriffs Highway). The turnpike road was very steep and was deemed rather unsatisfactory:Why should coaches have to labour up the long hill from Newcastle to the top of Gateshead Fell, and then go down the steep descent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Coach</b> & Horses inn just before Birtley, while those coming from the south had to climb and descend the hills in reverse?

500|$|Dworsky's {{first major}} {{commission}} was {{to design a}} basketball arena for his alma mater, the University of Michigan. The members of the 1947 Michigan Wolverines football team had reunions with Fritz Crisler every five years in Ann Arbor, {{and it was at}} one of those reunions that Crisler (by then the school's athletic director) gave Dworsky one of his big breaks, asking him to design the arena. Built in 1967, the arena was named Crisler Arena, as a tribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coach.</b> Dworsky's design of the arena was well received and was said to demonstrate [...] "his ability to combine majesty of scale with human accessibility". The roof of Crisler Arena is made of two plates, each weighing approximately 160tons. The bridge-like construction allows them to expand or contract given the change of seasons or the weight of the snow. Crisler Arena remains the home of Michigan's basketball team and houses memorabilia and trophies from all Wolverine varsity athletic teams.|$|E

According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>coach,</b> Muransky and Edwards were the only two who played with intensity against Wisconsin, and Bo left it to them to motivate the rest of the team.
