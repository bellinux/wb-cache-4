He summoned a Convention of preachers and of the Estates to Perth {{at the end of}} February 1597, and thither he brought many ministers from the north, men unlike the zealots of Lothian and the Lowlands. He persuaded them to vote themselves a General Assembly; and they admitted his right <b>to</b> <b>propose</b> <b>modifications</b> in Church government, to forbid unusual convocations (as in Edinburgh during the autumn of 1596); they were not to preach against Acts of Parliament or of Council, nor appoint preachers in the great towns without the Royal assent, and were not to attack individuals from the pulpit. An attempt was to be made to convert the Catholic lords. A General Assembly at Dundee in May ratified these decisions, to the wrath of Andrew Melville, and the Catholic earls were more or less reconciled to the Kirk, which at this period had not one supporter among the nobility. James had made large grants of Church lands among the noblesse, and they abstained from their wonted conspiracies for a while. The king occupied himself much in encouraging the persecution of witches, but even that did not endear him to the preachers.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{taxonomy}} of the Order Proteocephalidea, parasites of freshwater fishes, amphibia and reptilia, is being reapraised. The taxa of proteocephalids parasitizing fishes from South American rivers are evaluated on utilizing morphological characters, {{with the help}} of phylogenetic systematics. The Woodland´s classification divides the South American proteocephalids into two groups, Proteocephalidae and Monticellidae, depending on the position of vitellaria and gonads in medullar or cortical parenchyma of proglottids. With the intention <b>to</b> <b>propose</b> <b>modifications</b> in the classification, we discuss the trees that resulted from phylogenetic analysis. The conclusions are that the actual {{taxonomy of}} the group, based on the papers of Woodland (1933 - 1935), can not be supported by these analyses; consequently, it is suggested the supression of Monticellidae and its subfamilies. It is accepted only one family, Proteocephalidae, with five subfamilies: Proteocephalina...|$|E

The current Common-Rail injector driven by 1 st ECU generation is capable of operating under stable conditions with a minimum dwell between two consecutive injections of 1. 8 ms. This limits the possibility in using proper and efficient injection strategies for emission control purposes. A previous numerical study, performed by the electro-fluid-mechanical model built up by Matlab- Simulink environment, highlighted different area where injector may be improved with particular emphasis on electronic driving circuit and components design.

Second phase of Burrows-Wheeler transform consists of combination of Move-tofront, Run-length encoding algorithm and used to be written by Huffman or arithmetic encoding.

This suitability is tested likewise on large XML files. It is appropriate <b>to</b> <b>propose</b> <b>modification</b> of Burrows-Wheeler second phase's algorithms for large alphabets.

This allows us to combine the measurement and the compression process into one consistent framework.

The compressibility properties of spectral lines are analyzed in detail. The results shown in this paper demonstrate that, thanks to the compressibility properties of spectral lines, it is feasible to reconstruct the signals using {{only a small fraction}} of the information that is measured nowadays. We investigate in depth the quality of the reconstruction as a function of the amount of data measured and the influence of noise.

40|$|Obesity {{has reached}} {{epidemic}} proportions {{in many countries}} and is an established risk factor in many chronic illnesses, but its role in acute illness is less clear. Pancreatologists have long recognized obesity as {{a risk factor for}} a poor outcome in severe acute pancreatitis. There are now several studies that have identified obesity as a primary risk factor for developing local complications (abscess, pseudocyst, necrosis), organ failure, and death. Indeed, meta-analysis of these studies gives a relative risk of 4. 3 for local complications, 2. 0 for systemic complications, and 2. 1 for death. This has led <b>to</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>modifications</b> of acute pancreatitis scoring systems to include obesity as an independent primary predictive factor of severe disease. Obesity is associated with a low-grade inflammatory state, which may predispose obese patients to such complications.

On the strength of plant complexity and large dimension, work methodology was split into two parts: initially, the whole plant was evaluated with traditional Pinch Analysis tools. Several opportunities were identified and modifications proposed. Modifications were segregated to represent small and independent portions of the original process. One of them was selected to be re-analyzed, considering two scenarios. Reduction of problem dimension allowed mathematical methodologies (formulation with decomposition, applying LP, MILP and NLP optimization methods) to synthesize flexible networks to be applied, generating a feasible modification capable of fulfilling the proposed operational scenarios...|$|E
