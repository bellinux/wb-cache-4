For example, most studies of the DFE in viruses used site-directed mutagenesis to create point mutations and measure relative fitness of each mutant. In Escherichia coli, one study used <b>transposon</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> to directly measure the fitness of a random insertion of a derivative of Tn10. In yeast, a combined mutagenesis and deep sequencing approach has been developed to generate high-quality systematic mutant libraries and measure fitness in high throughput. However, given that many mutations have effects too small to be detected and that mutagenesis experiments can detect only mutations of moderately large effect; DNA sequence data analysis can provide valuable information about these mutations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Transposon</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> {{was first}} studied by Barbara McClintock in the mid-20th century during her Nobel Prize-winning work with corn. McClintock {{received}} her BSc in 1923 from Cornell’s College of Agriculture. By 1927 {{she had her}} PhD in botany, and she immediately began working {{on the topic of}} maize chromosomes. In the early 1940s, McClintock was studying the progeny of self-pollinated maize plants which resulted from crosses having a broken chromosome 9. These plants were missing their telomeres. This research prompted the first discovery of a transposable element, and from there <b>transposon</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> have been exploited as a biological tool.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Transposon</b> <b>mutagenesis,</b> or {{transposition}} mutagenesis, is {{a biological}} process that allows genes {{to be transferred}} to a host organism's chromosome, interrupting or modifying the function of an [...] gene on the chromosome and causing mutation. <b>Transposon</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> is much more effective than chemical mutagenesis, with a higher mutation frequency and a lower chance of killing the organism. Other advantages include being able to induce single hit mutations, being able to incorporate selectable markers in strain construction, and being able to recover genes after mutagenesis. Disadvantages include the low frequency of transposition in living systems, and the inaccuracy of most transposition systems.|$|E

50|$|J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) {{conducted}} a study to find all the essential genes of M. genitalium through global <b>transposon</b> <b>mutagenesis.</b> As a result they found that 382 out of 482 protein coding genes were essential. Genes encoding proteins of unknown function constitute 28% of the essential protein coding genes set. Before conducting this study the JCVI had performed another study on the non-essential genes, genes not required for growth, of M.genitalium, where they reported the use of <b>transposon</b> <b>mutagenesis.</b> Despite figuring out the non-essential genes, it is not confirmed that the products that these genes make have any important biological functions. It was only through gene essentiality studies of bacteria that JCVI {{have been able to}} compose a hypothetical minimal gene sets.|$|E
5000|$|Non-essential genes can be {{discovered}} by inducing <b>transposon</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> in an organism. The transformed genes {{can then be}} identified by performing PCR on the organism's recovered genome using an ORF-specific primer and a transposon-specific primer. Since transposons can incorporate themselves into non-coding regions of DNA, the ORF-specific primer ensures that the transposon interrupted a gene. Because the organism survived after homologous integration, the interrupted gene was clearly non-essential.|$|E

40|$|The NEC 1 gene, {{previously}} {{isolated from}} Petunia hybrida, is expressed {{at high levels}} in nectaries, and in a very localized fashion in stamens, particularly in the anther stomium cells and {{the upper part of}} the filament. To elucidate the function of the NEC 1 gene, co-suppression was employed for down-regulation of NEC 1 expression, and <b>transposon</b> insertion <b>mutagenesis</b> was used to knock out the NEC 1 function. Among the transgenic plants and plants carrying dTph 1 inserted in the NEC 1 gene, an "early open anther" phenotype was observed. In this mutant phenotype, the anthers already open in young flower buds (1. 8 cm) that still contain immature pollen, resulting in poor pollen quality and impaired pollen release. The results obtained indicate that NEC 1 might be involved in the development of stomium cells, which are ruptured during the normal process of anther dehiscence to release mature pollen. Southern analysis revealed the presence of a highly homologous NEC 1 -like gene, named NEC 2, in the P. hybrida genome. The presence of NEC 2 was confirmed by segregation analysis and sequencing of genomic clones. The implications of these results and possible reasons why no visually obvious phenotype in nectaries could be produced by co-suppression or <b>transposon</b> insertion <b>mutagenesis</b> are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Triparental mating {{is a form}} of Bacterial {{conjugation}} where a conjugative plasmid {{present in}} one bacterial strain assists the transfer of a mobilizable plasmid present in a second bacterial strain into a third bacterial strain. Plasmids are introduced into bacteria for such purposes as transformation, cloning, or <b>transposon</b> <b>mutagenesis.</b> Triparental matings can help overcome some of the barriers to efficient plasmid mobilization. For instance, if the conjugative plasmid and the mobilizable plasmid are members of the same incompatibility group they do not need to stably coexist in the second bacterial strain for the mobilizable plasmid to be transferred.|$|E

5000|$|Over {{the past}} decade, SB transposons have been {{developed}} as non-viral vectors for introduction of genes into genomes of vertebrate animals and for gene therapy. The genetic cargo can be an expression cassette—a transgene and associated elements that confer transcriptional regulation for expression at a desired level in specific tissue(s). An alternative use of SB transposons is to discover functions of genes, especially those that cause cancer, by delivering DNA sequences that maximally disrupt expression of genes close to the insertion site. This process {{is referred to as}} insertional mutagenesis or <b>transposon</b> <b>mutagenesis.</b> When a gene is inactivated by insertion of a transposon (or other mechanism), that gene is “knocked out”. Knockout mice and knockout rats have been made with the SB system. [...] Figure 4 illustrates these two uses of SB transposons.|$|E
40|$|The use of acid {{tolerant}} rhizobacteria such as Bradyrhizobium japonicum is one {{effort for}} increasing soybean productivity in acid soil.

The {{objective of this}} study was to investigate the growth and production of soybean var. Wilis inoculated by B. japonicum and NPK inorganic fertilizer application in acid soil. Two isolates of B. japonicum that were BJ 11 (19) and BJ 11 (wt) were used as inoculant for soybean.

50|$|In {{addition}} to its importance as a pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium {{has been instrumental in}} the development of genetic tools that led to an understanding of fundamental bacterial physiology. These developments were enabled by the discovery of the first generalized transducing phage, P22, in Typhimurium that allowed quick and easy genetic exchange that allowed fine structure genetic analysis. The large number of mutants led to a revision of genetic nomenclature for bacteria. Many of the uses of transposons as genetic tools, including <b>transposon</b> delivery, <b>mutagenesis,</b> construction of chromosome rearrangements, were also developed in Typhimurium. These genetic tools also led to a simple test for carcinogens, the Ames Test.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of bacteria, {{transposition}} mutagenesis is usually accomplished {{by way of a}} plasmid from which a transposon is extracted and inserted into the host chromosome. This usually requires a set of enzymes including transposase to be translated. The transposase can be expressed either on a separate plasmid, or on the plasmid containing the gene to be integrated. Alternatively, an injection of transposase mRNA into the host cell can induce translation and expression. Early <b>transposon</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> experiments relied on bacteriophages and conjugative bacterial plasmids for the insertion of sequences. These were very non-specific, and made it difficult to incorporate specific genes. A newer technique called shuttle mutagenesis uses specific cloned genes from the host species to incorporate genetic elements. Another effective approach is to deliver transposons through viral capsids. This facilitates integration into the chromosome and long-term transgene expression.|$|E
50|$|Transposons {{are highly}} regulated, {{discrete}} DNA segments that can relocate within the genome. They are universal and {{are found in}} Eubacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, including humans. Transposons have a large influence on gene expression {{and can be used}} to determine gene function. In fact, when a transposon inserts itself in a gene, the gene's function will be disrupted. Because of that property, transposons have been manipulated for use in insertional mutagenesis. The development of microbial genome sequencing was a major advance for the use of <b>transposon</b> <b>mutagenesis.</b> The function affected by a transposon insertion could be linked to the disrupted gene by sequencing the genome to locate the transposon insertion site. Massively parallel sequencing allows simultaneous sequencing of transposon insertion sites in large mixtures of different mutants. Therefore, genome-wide analysis is feasible if transposons are positioned throughout the genome in a mutant collection.|$|E

50|$|In 1999, the {{virulence}} genes {{associated with}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis were identified through transposon mutagenesis-mediated gene knockout. A plasmid named pCG113 containing kanamycin resistance genes and the IS1096 insertion sequence was engineered to contain variable 80-base pair tags. The plasmids were then transformed into M. tuberculosis cells by electroporation. Colonies were plated on kanamycin to select for resistant cells. Colonies that underwent random transposition events {{were identified by}} BamHI digestion and Southern blotting using an internal IS1096 DNA probe. Colonies were screened for attenuated multiplication to identify colonies with mutations in candidate virulence genes. Mutations leading to an attenuated phenotype were mapped by amplification of adjacent regions to the IS1096 sequences and compared with the published M. tuberculosis genome. In this instance <b>transposon</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> identified 13 pathogenic loci in the M. tuberculosis genome which were not previously associated with disease.

50|$|Genetic screens have {{identified}} genes {{belonging to the}} KNOX family in this function. These genes essentially maintain the stem cells in an undifferentiated state. The KNOX family has undergone {{quite a bit of}} evolutionary diversification, while keeping the overall mechanism more or less similar. Members of the KNOX family have been found in plants as diverse as Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, barley and tomato. KNOX-like genes are also present in some algae, mosses, ferns and gymnosperms. Misexpression of these genes leads to formation of interesting morphological features. For example, among members of Antirrhinae, only the species of genus Antirrhinum lack a structure called spur in the floral region. A spur is considered an evolutionary innovation because it defines pollinator specificity and attraction. Researchers carried out <b>transposon</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> in Antirrhinum majus, and saw that some insertions led to formation of spurs that were very similar to the other members of Antirrhinae, indicating that the loss of spur in wild Antirrhinum majus populations could probably be an evolutionary innovation.|$|E
50|$|The Tn5 {{transposon}} {{system is}} a model system {{for the study of}} transposition and for the application of <b>transposon</b> <b>mutagenesis.</b> Tn5 is a bacterial composite transposon in which genes (the original system containing antibiotic resistance genes) are flanked by two nearly identical insertion sequences, named IS50R and IS50L corresponding to the right and left sides of the transposon respectively. The IS50R sequence codes for two proteins, Tnp and Inh. These two proteins are identical in sequence, save for the fact that Inh is lacking the 55 N-terminal amino acids. Tnp codes for a transposase for the entire system, and Inh encodes an inhibitor of transposase. The DNA-binding domain of Tnp resides in the 55 N-terminal amino acids, and so these residues are essential for function. The IS50R and IS50L sequences are both flanked by 19-base pair elements on the inside and outside ends of the transposon, labelled IE and OE respectively. Mutation of these regions results in an inability of transposase genes to bind to the sequences. The binding interactions between transposase and these sequences is very complicated, and is affected by DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks. In addition, other proteins {{seem to be able to}} bind with and affect the transposition of the IS50 elements, such as DnaA.|$|E
