25|$|Title {{insurance}} {{is available in}} many other countries, such as Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico, New Zealand, Japan, China, Korea and throughout Europe. However, while {{a substantial number of}} properties located in these countries are insured by U.S. title insurers, they do not constitute a significant share of the real estate transactions in those countries. They also do not constitute a large share <b>of</b> U.S. <b>title</b> insurers' revenues. In many cases these are properties to be used for commercial purposes by U.S. companies doing business abroad, or properties financed by U.S lenders.

40|$|Habitat {{degradation}} {{by humans}} {{has been the}} main reason for the decline in numbers of P. floridanus, the only mammal indigenous to the state of Florida, in the past century. The mouse inhabits what remains of scrub and sandhill associations, which are characterized by patches of sandy soils within a more mesic landscape. It has long been accepted that small populations are more prone to decline and extinction than are larger ones as a result of environmental fluctuations. I hypothesized that the demography of a population of P. floridanus would be affected by a restriction in numbers through habitat patch size in a deterministic way, even without any environmental effects. I also examined dispersal and looked for <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> metapopulation dynamics. Mark-recapture data were collected from ten scrub fragments in Lake Wales Ridge State Forest, Polk County, FL, ranging in size from 0. 5 to 170 ha. Program MARK was used to model survival, recruitment and population growth rate of P. floridanus as a function of habitat patch size and to evaluate temporary migration patterns. Recruitment was positively associated with patch size, but contrary to expectations survival and population growth were negatively associated with patch size. Results suggested that survival was negatively affected by ear tagging, although this effect was <b>temporary.</b> <b>Evidence</b> <b>of</b> migration was found, but would probably have been greater if trapping had been continued until after peak reproduction, when juveniles tend to disperse in search of resources. The degree of interbreeding among patches can only be determined with the help of genetic analyses. Microsatellites have become useful in analyses at the population level because of their high degree of variability. Future research including genetic analyses is recommended to evaluate the importance of gene flow among subgroups to demography and the viability of the study population...|$|R

The paper presents empirical <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a constant and structurally stable M 3 money demand function for South Africa over the period 1968 - 97.

40|$|Of the securities,provided by {{law for the}} {{protection}} of property, perhaps none {{is more important than the}} registration <b>of</b> land <b>titles.</b> We put aside, very early, the old English notion that the best <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> was the possession <b>of</b> the <b>title</b> deeds, and adopted a system which, in theory, proposed to place in a public office, accessible to everyone, a record <b>of</b> the <b>titles</b> to real estate, by which every man might safely buy or safely accept encumbrances. Speaking generally now of the system, the theory seems to be nearly perfect. Every instrument affecting the title to lands must be executed in the presence of a public officer, who is empowered by law to authenticate the act, and it is only on his certificate, given after the observance of all due formalities, that the instrument can go upon record. The record is made up by another public officer, who is permitted to record nothing which is defective, and who shall carefully note the day, hour, and minute when any instrument is presented for record. To insure the prompt recording, the grantee or encumbrancee is notified that his unrecorded instrument shall be invalid as against any subsequent deed or encumbrance which a bona fide taker may receive from the same party, and place first upon record; and as this penalty seems to render it reasonably sure that there will be no needless delay, it is supposed the record will show the actual condition <b>of</b> the <b>title,</b> except in cases of gross neglect. Those cases the law declines to provide for; assuming that it is better that parties failing to record their titles shall run all risks of loss, than that the public record shall be an unsafe reliance. We therefore find this record generally trusted, as if it were something almost infallible; and titles are bought and mortgages taken in reliance upon the mere certificate of the recorder that the grantor or mortgagor is owner...|$|R

5000|$|The {{underlying}} dispute, {{as with so}} many early colonial cases, {{was over}} ownership of land, but Dallas’s report does not specify where in the Pennsylvania colony it was located. The defendant (presumably, Robeson) relied on a colonial Chancery Court decree as <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> his <b>title</b> to the land. However, the Pennsylvania Provincial Act creating the Chancery Court had been repealed by the King and the Council. (King George and his Council often repealed acts of colonial legislatures, especially those acts creating instruments of independent government, or otherwise asserting the rights of colonists.) [...] The Chancery Court’s decree regarding the disputed title had been issued after the King and Council had repealed the Act, but before notice of such repeal reached Pennsylvania. The issue, therefor was whether the Act was effectively repealed by the date when the Chancery Court issued its decree. If it was repealed, then the Court was without legal existence, and its decree would be meaningless. If, however, the Act creating the Court was not considered repealed until notice of that repeal reached Pennsylvania, then the Chancery Court decree was still valid, and supported the defendant’s title to the land.|$|R
