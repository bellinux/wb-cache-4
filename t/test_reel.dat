Burton was persuaded to change his mind to employ computer animation, which brought the final production budget to $80 million. Although Purves was uncredited for his work, stop-motion supervisors Ian Mackinnon and Peter Saunders, who would later collaborate with Burton on Corpse Bride, received character design credit. Warner Digital Studios was responsible for the scenes of global destruction, airborne flying saucer sequences, the Martian landing in Nevada, and the robot that chases Richie Norris in his pickup truck. Warner Digital also used practical effects, such as building scale models of Big Ben and other landmarks. The destruction of Art Land's hotel was footage of the real-life night-time demolition of The Landmark Hotel and Casino, a building Burton wished to immortalize.|$|E

25|$|Fincher {{intended}} to make The Game before Seven, but when Brad Pitt became available for Seven, that project took priority. The success of Seven helped the producers of The Game get the larger budget that they wanted. Then, they approached Michael Douglas to star in the film. He was hesitant at first because of concerns that PolyGram was not a big enough company to distribute the film. However, once on board, Douglas' presence helped get the film into production. At the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, PolyGram announced that Jodie Foster would be starring in the film with Douglas. However, Fincher was uncomfortable with putting a movie star of her stature in a supporting part. After talking to her, he considered rewriting the character of Conrad as Nicholas' daughter so that Foster could play that role. However, the actress had a scheduling conflict with the Robert Zemeckis film Contact and could not appear in The Game. Once she left, the role of Conrad was offered to Jeff Bridges but he declined and Sean Penn was cast instead. Deborah Kara Unger's audition {{for the role of}} Christine was a <b>test</b> <b>reel</b> consisting of a two-minute sex scene from David Cronenberg's Crash.

40|$|This {{work was}} carried out on the {{pastoral}} zone of Niger, the main objective was {{to contribute to the}} improvement of the methods of forage yields predicting mainly in the Sahel and especially in Niger. This is specifically to validate the model BIOMASAH of ARC; test the MEIA model; to establish a reference model by multiple linear regression; test the similarity method and finally compare the methods. The work {{was carried out}} on the one hand with the data measured on the ground by the MEIA from 2001 to 2012, reel rainfall of Niger observations network, meteorological parameters from ECMWF and also with satellite images as SPOT NDVI VEGETATION and MODIS, RFE 2 of FEWS NET. Validation of BIOMASAH model was made by t and Wilcoxon <b>tests</b> to compare <b>reel</b> biomass and outputs of the model. Pearson, Kendall and Spearman correlation testing was also made. The MEIA model performance was tested by confronting the results between and within SPOT VEGETATION and MODIS sensors, by comparing R² and RMSE from the integral and maximum NDVI as a predictor of forage yield. Average comparisons by parametric and nonparametric tests were also made to compare the results. The reference model (RM) was produced by multiple linear regression with stepwise method. The selection of variables was based on adjusted R² and RMSE and the LOOCV leave one out cross validation to calculate R² for validation, we made also systematic diagnosis of residues for better characterization of the model. The similarity method was performed using the R², MAD and RMSE as a criterion, the profile of the vegetation growth period of each pixel was plotted for all years. Then we compare the profile of the target year with those of other years to identify the similar year. One hand the results of similarity were compared with actual data with the Pearson correlation test, Spearman and Kendall and secondly using t and Wilcoxon tests to compare means. Comparison of models was {{made on the basis of}} R², Adjusted R² and RMSE. Model BIOMASAH result on significant difference between average (p < 0. 001). Pearson correlations, Kendall and Spearman are low. Regarding the MEIA model, globally R² (0. 56) is best, there’s no difference to use MODIS NDVI or SPOT vegetation, the RMSE is 367 kg. ha- 1. R² and RMSE vary greatly from one year to another. On a global scale the multiple linear model gave a good R² adjusted (0. 69) and RMSE (282 kg / ha) the difference between the calculated and the RMSE of validation is 2. 72 kg. Comparing averages of the similarity to the real ones showed that there are no significant differences (p < 0. 001) for R² with the differences are significant against the same threshold for the MAD and RMSE.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 's US and Italian {{scientists}} collaborated {{to study the}} electrodynamics of dragging a satellite on a tether through the electrically charged portion of Earth's atmosphere called the ionosphere. An electrical current induced in the long wire {{could be used for}} power and thrust generation for a satellite. Other tether uses include momentum exchange, artificial gravity, deployment of sensors or antennas, and gravity-gradient stabilization for satellites. Before the Tethered Space Satellite (TSS- 1), no long tether had ever been flown, so many questions existed on how it would actually behave. The TSS consisted of a satellite with science experiments attached to a 12. 5 mile long, very thin (0. 10 inch diameter) copper wire assembly wound around a spool in the deployer reel mechanism. With the Space Shuttle at an altitude of 160 nautical miles above earth, the satellite was to be deployed by raising it from the Shuttle bay on a boom facing away from Earth. Once cleared of the bay, the deployer mechanism was to slowly feed out the 12 -plus miles of tether. Scientific data would be collected throughout the operation, after which the satellite would be reeled back in. Pre-flight testing system level tests involved setting up a tether receiver to catch the 12. 5 mile tether onto another reel as it was being unwound by the deployer <b>reel</b> mechanism. <b>Testing</b> only the <b>reel</b> mechanism is straightforward. This test becomes more complicated when the TSS is mounted on the flight pallet at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The system level tests must be passed before the pallet can be installed into the Space Shuttle cargo bay. A few months before flight, the TSS payload had been integrated onto the Spacelab pallet and system level tests, including unreeling and reeling the tether, had been successfully completed. Some of this testing equipment was then shipped back to the contractor Martin Marietta. Systems-level load analyses, which cannot be run until all information about each payload is finalized, was run in parallel with the physical integration of the hardware into the Shuttle payload bay. The coupled loads analysis, as it is called, incorporates any updates to the model due to system level tests, and any changes that were found during integration. The coupled loads analysis revealed that a single bolt attaching the deployer reel mechanism to the support structure had a "negative margin" - which is an indication that it might fail during operation. Hardware certification rules do not allow for hardware to fly with negative margins, so this issue had to be resolved before the flight. Since there is conservatism in engineering analysis, there is an option to "waive" the margin requirement, and fly the experiment as is. On the other hand, a structural failure of one payload could have serious or catastrophic consequences to other payloads and possibly the mission. Minor design changes or fixes might be feasible within the payload bay prior to launch. Any major design changes that required the spooling test to validate the hardware, or for the pallet to be removed, would cause TSS not to be ready for the Shuttle launch...|$|R

40|$|Atualmente, sabe-se que danos causados por espécies exóticas invasoras são umas das principais causas de extinção de espécies, afetando mais seriamente espécies que evoluíram em ilhas. A jaqueira, Artocarpus heterophyllus Lamarck (Moraceae) é originária das florestas tropicais da Índia. Foi introduzida no Brasil ainda no período Colonial e atualmente é invasora em áreas de Mata Atlântica, incluindo a Ilha Grande, RJ. Durante três anos foram amostrados bimestralmente 18 grades, 10 com diferentes densidades de jaqueiras e oito sem jaqueiras. Em cada grade foram colocadas 11 armadilhas de captura de mamíferos, que ficavam abertas durante três dias consecutivos por mês. No laboratório as fezes de todos os animais capturados foram analisadas para verificar a dieta e a quantidade de sementes nativas defecadas. Para verificar as espécies capazes de predar e dispersar sementes de jaca, fizemos testes com sementes de jaca atados a carretéis e armadilhas fotográficas. Neste contexto, o estudo teve como objetivo verificar a influência da jaqueira na comunidade de pequenos mamíferos e na dispersão de sementes de espécies nativas. Os resultados mostraram que em áreas com maior densidade de jaqueiras adultas, houve uma maior abundância de espécies frugívoras e a diminuição da abundância de espécies mais insetívoras. Embora a jaqueira não tenha influenciado no consumo de itens de origem animal e vegetal entre áreas com e sem jaqueiras e durante os períodos de maior e menor frutificação, essa espécie desfavoreceu a dispersão de sementes nativas. Em áreas com maior densidade de jaqueiras verificamos uma quantidade menor de sementes nativas sendo defecadas pelos pequenos mamíferos. O número de sementes defecadas durante o período de menor frutificação das jaqueiras não foi significativo em relação ao período de maior frutificação e em todos os períodos somados. Já em relação à frequência de fezes contendo sementes nativas, os resultados das regressões simples foram significativos para todos os períodos. O fruto da jaqueira A. heterophyllus foi mais consumido por D. aurita, T. dimidiatus eCuniculus paca, sendo que D. auritanão teve influência sobre a predação e a dispersão de sementes de jaca. Os roedores T. dimidiatuse C. paca foram registrados pelas armadilhas fotográficas predando 20 % e 16 % das sementes de jaca e carregaram 65 % e 44 % das sementes, respectivamente. Os testes com carretel mostraram que 86 % das sementes foram predadas, 10 % foram deixadas intactas {{no local}} e apenas 4 % foram dispersas a pequenas distâncias, entre 2 e 15 metros, sendo possível que esses roedores propiciem a dispersão dessa espécie exótica e invasora para novas áreasNowadays, {{it is known}} that damages caused by {{invasive}} exotic species are one of major causes of species extinction, most seriously affecting species that evolved on islands. The jackfruit, Artocarpus heterophyllus Lamarck (Moraceae) is originated from tropical forests of India, being the tree that produces the largest fruit. It was introduced in Brazil in the colonial period and is now invasive in several localities of the Atlantic Forest, including Ilha Grande, RJ. During three years, were sampled bimonthly in 18 grids, 10 with different densities of jackfruits trees and eight without jackfruit trees. In each grid were placed 11 traps for capture of mammals. The traps remained open for three consecutive days monthly. During this period was also checked a number of jackfruit trees in the grids and counted mature fruits of each tree. At the laboratory, the feces of all captured animals were analyzed to verify diet and amount of native seeds defecated. To verify species capable of preying and disperse jackfruit seeds, we conducted tests with jackfruit seeds tied to reels and camera traps. In this context, this study aimed to determine an influence of jackfruit tree in a community of small mammals and in seeds dispersal of native species. The results showed that A. heterophyllus influenced in an abundance of species of small mammals in Ilha Grande. In areas with high density of adult jackfruit trees, was a greater abundance of frugivorous species, such as Trinomys dimidiatus and Guerlinguetus ingrami, and decreased abundance of species as most insectivorous as Dasypus novemcintus, Oxymycterus dasytrichus and Monodelphis americana. Although jackfruit tree has not influenced in consumption items between animal and vegetable areas with and without jackfruit trees and during periods of greater and lesser fruitification, this species discouraging dispersal of native seeds. In areas with high density of jackfruit tree we found a smaller amount of native seeds being defecated by small mammals. The number of seeds defecated during the minor fruiting period of jackfruit trees was not significant, however, during the period of greater fruiting and in all periods summed were significant. In relation to frequency of feces containing native seeds, the results of simple regressions were significant for all periods and Didelphis aurita was the species that most influenced these results. The fruit of the jackfruit tree A. heterophyllus was more consumed by D. aurita, T. dimidiatus and Cuniculus paca, and D. aurita had no influence on predation and seed dispersal of jackfruit, having no record of possible predation or seed dispersal by camera traps. Rodents T. and C. dimidiatus paca were recorded by camera traps preying 20 % and 16 % of seeds of jackfruit and carried 65 % and 44 % seeds, respectively. <b>Tests</b> with <b>reel</b> showed that 86 % of seeds were predated, 10 % were left intact at site and only 4 % were dispersed at short distances between 2 and 15 meters, it is possible that these rodents provide to spread of this exotic and invasive species into new areas...|$|R

Four models were built: two jointed 18-inch aluminum, foam rubber, latex, and rabbit fur models (to be rotated during filming), one jointed 24-inch model of the same materials for the New York scenes, and a small model of lead and fur for the tumbling-down-the-Empire-State-Building scene. At least two armatures have survived - one believed to be the original made for the test footage - and are owned by Peter Jackson and Bob Burns. In 2009, one sold for £121,000 ($200,000) at Christie's in London.|$|E
50|$|Jackson, a {{longtime}} {{fan of the}} comics, had used motion capture in The Lord of the Rings and King Kong. He suggested that a live action adaptation would not {{do justice to the}} comic books and motion capture was the best way of representing Hergé's world of Tintin. A week of filming took place in November 2006 in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California, on the stage where James Cameron shot Avatar. Andy Serkis had been cast, while Jackson stood in for Tintin. Cameron and Robert Zemeckis were present during the shoot. The footage was transmitted to Weta Digital, who produced a twenty-minute <b>test</b> <b>reel</b> that demonstrated a photorealistic depiction of the characters. Spielberg said he would not mind filming it digitally because he saw it as an animated film, and reiterated his live action work would always be filmed traditionally. Lead designer Chris Guise visited Brussels to see the inspiration for Hergé's sceneries.|$|E
