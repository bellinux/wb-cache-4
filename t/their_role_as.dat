5|$|Ant {{societies}} have division of labour, communication between individuals, {{and an ability}} to solve complex problems. These parallels with human {{societies have}} long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.|$|E
5|$|Fringe is {{produced}} by Bad Robot Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television. Co-creator J.J. Abrams continued to work as executive producer along with fellow co-creators Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, who returned as consulting producers. Bryan Burk and Joe Chappelle also returned as executive producers, while Akiva Goldsman worked as consulting producer. Executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman continued in <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> showrunners for the third season, which involved overseeing every episode and sometimes directly contributing episode scripts. As with every season, they laid out the third season's storyline a year in advance.|$|E
5|$|The silver frame {{around the}} Black Stone {{and the black}} kiswah or cloth {{enveloping}} the Kaaba were for centuries maintained by the Ottoman Sultans in <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.

Groves then sent a personal letter to the head of their university or company asking for them to be released for essential war work. At the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Stanislaw Ulam gave one of his students, Joan Hinton, an exam early, so she could leave to do war work. A few weeks later, Ulam received a letter from Hans Bethe, inviting him to join the project. Conant personally persuaded Kistiakowsky to join the project.|$|E
5|$|Weizmann's {{political}} efforts {{picked up}} speed, and on 10December 1914 {{he met with}} Herbert Samuel, a British Cabinet member and a secular Jew who had studied Zionism; Samuel believed Weizmann's demands were too modest. Two days later, Weizmann met Balfour again, {{for the first time}} since their initial meeting in 1905; Balfour had been out of government ever since his electoral defeat in 1906, but remained a senior member of the Conservative Party in <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> Official Opposition.|$|E
5|$|After two matches as interim coach, Wilmots {{agreed to}} replace Leekens as manager. Following his appointment, the team's results improved, such that some foreign media {{regarded}} it as another Belgian golden generation. The young Belgian squad qualified as unbeaten group winners for the 2014 World Cup finals, and earned Belgium's second-ever {{place in a}} World Cup quarter-finals with a four-game winning streak. Belgium qualified for Euro 2016 with a match to spare in October 2015, and took the top spot in the FIFA World Rankings {{for the first time}} in November 2015, to stay first for five months. In the following year, Belgium could not confirm <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> outsider at the European Championship with a quarter-final elimination by the 26th FIFA-ranked Welsh team; this prompted the RBFA to dismiss Wilmots. In the 2018 World Cup qualifying allocation, they were seeded first in their group, and made the final tournament under Spanish manager Roberto Martínez, becoming the first European team besides the hosts Russia to do so.|$|E

5|$|Amino acids are organic {{compounds}} containing amine (-NH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups, {{along with a}} side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N), although other elements {{are found in the}} side chains of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are known (though only 20 appear in the genetic code) and can be classified in many ways. They can be classified according to the core structural functional groups' locations as alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-) or delta- (δ-) amino acids; other categories relate to polarity, pH level, and side chain group type (aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic, containing hydroxyl or sulfur, etc.). In the form of proteins, amino acid residues form the second-largest component (water is the largest) of human muscles and other tissues. Beyond <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> residues in proteins, amino acids participate in a number of processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|In works where elves are {{the main}} characters, such as The Silmarillion or Wendy and Richard Pini’s comic book series Elfquest, elves exhibit a similar range of {{behaviour}} to a human cast, distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers. However, where narratives are more human-centered, as in The Lord of the Rings, elves tend to sustain <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> powerful, sometimes threatening, outsiders. Despite the obvious fictionality of fantasy novels and games, scholars have found that elves in these works {{continue to have a}} subtle role in shaping the real-life identities of their audiences. For example, elves can function to encode real-world racial others in video games, or to influence gender-norms through literature.|$|E
5|$|Strike Back {{began as}} a six-part series from Sky1, based on a book {{of the same name}} from former Special Air Service (SAS) soldier turned novelist Chris Ryan. It {{transmitted}} two episodes weekly from 5 to 19 May 2010. The first two episodes more than tripled Sky1's audience share in its timeslot in the past three months. On August 2010, Sky1 controller Stuart Murphy commissioned a second series to consist of a longer run of ten episodes. Left Bank Pictures continued <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> the production company. In February 2011, it was announced that Sky entered a co-production deal with the American television network Cinemax, as the network wanted to introduce new drama series. Strike Back became one of two television projects to be produced by British and American networks in 2011, the other being , which was produced between the BBC and Starz.|$|E

5|$|The use of sandbox {{applications}} like Garry's Mod {{have allowed}} for the Vortigaunt {{to be used in}} a variety of webcomics and machinima productions. For example, in the webcomic Concerned, the inability for the players to harm allied non-player characters such as the Vortigaunt in Half-Life 2 forms a recurring joke, where the protagonist Gordon Frohman constantly tries to shoot Vortigaunts due to <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> enemies in Half-Life. This eventually backfires on him, as when Vortigaunts try to rescue Frohman from the destruction of the Citadel, his hostile nature leads them to simply abandon him to his fate. Vortigaunts are occasionally featured in machinima productions, often taking on the roles of minor characters, such as janitors under Combine jurisdiction. In addition, Vortigaunts are central to one Half-Life single-player modification, POV – Point of View, in which the player assumes the role of a Vortigaunt slave attacking Black Mesa.|$|E
5|$|The walls never proved very {{successful}} as defensive structures, and were easily breached {{on more than}} one occasion. They served more as a means of controlling trade and taxing goods, and as a deterrent to smugglers. Throughout their history, the town walls of Edinburgh have served better in <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> a trade barrier than as a defensive one. By the mid 18th century, the walls had outlived both their defensive and trade purposes, and demolition of sections of the wall began. The Netherbow Port was pulled down in 1764, and demolition continued into the 19th century. Today, a number of sections of the three successive walls survive, although none of the ports remain.|$|E
5|$|There was {{pressure}} on the mounted police to assist local government {{in a wide variety}} of ways, often opposed by the police themselves. These included supporting public health efforts, distributing relief, fighting and investigating fires, and continuing to manage the movement of cattle. New railway lines continued to be constructed, and the police were tasked to assist in the building the Canadian Northern and Grand Trunk Pacific lines, as well as the Crow's Nest Pass branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway, following the pattern set by their earlier work in the 1880s. The was a heavy legal load on the force's commissioned officers both in <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> magistrates and as informal arbitrators between company management and the construction teams.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to Adaptive Coloration in Animals, Cott wrote two essays on camouflage: “Camouflage {{in nature and}} in war” in the Royal Engineers Journal (December 1938), pp501–517; and ”Animal form in relation to appearance” in Lancelot Law Whyte, ed. Aspects of form: a symposium on form in nature and art (London: Percy Lund Humphries, 1951). As a scientific illustrator and photographer, he also wrote three other books: Zoological photography in practice (1956); Uganda {{in black and white}} (1959); and Looking at animals: a zoologist in Africa (1975). He became interested in the relationship of bird colours with <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> warning colours, an idea that arose when he observed hornets attracted to some birds being skinned while ignoring others. This led him to study the palatability of birds and their eggs. Among his papers were several studies on the relative palatibility of the eggs based initially on the preferences of ferrets, rats and hedgehogs and later on the use of a panel of expert egg tasters. In one study he found that of 123 species of bird, the kittiwake eggs scored highly with 8.2 out of 10.|$|E
5|$|It {{is clear}} {{nevertheless}} that the gradual {{decline of the}} indigenous Byzantine naval power in the 10th and 11th centuries, when it was eclipsed by the Italian city-states, chiefly Venice and later Genoa, was of great long-term significance for {{the fate of the}} Empire. The sack of the Fourth Crusade, which shattered the foundations of the Byzantine state, was {{due in large part to}} the absolute defencelessness of the Empire at sea. This process was initiated by Byzantium itself in the 9th century, when the Italians were increasingly employed by the Empire to compensate for its own naval weakness in the West. The Italian republics also profited from <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> intermediaries in the trade between the Empire and Western Europe, marginalizing the Byzantine merchant marine, which in turn had adverse effects on the availability of Byzantine naval forces. Inevitably however, as the Italian republics slowly moved away from the Byzantine orbit, they began pursuing their own policies, and from the late 11th century on, they turned from protection of the Empire to exploitation and sometimes outright plunder, heralding the eventual financial and political subjugation of Byzantium to their interests. The absence of a strong navy was certainly keenly felt by the Byzantines at the time, as the comments of Kekaumenos illustrate. Strong and energetic emperors like Manuel Komnenos, and later Michael VIII Palaiologos, could revive Byzantine naval power, but even after landing heavy strokes against the Venetians, they merely replaced them with the Genoese and the Pisans. Trade thus remained in Latin hands, its profits continued to be siphoned off from the Empire, and after their deaths, their achievements quickly evaporated. After 1204, and with the brief exception of Michael VIII's reign, the fortunes of the now small Byzantine navy were more or less tied to the shifting alliances with the Italian maritime republics.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are also}} {{involved}} in signal transduction through <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> the home of integral membrane proteins. This is an extremely broad and important class of biomolecule. It is estimated that up {{to a third of}} the human proteome may be membrane proteins. Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane. An example of this is the CD59 protein, which identifies cells as “self” and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system. The HIV virus evades the immune system in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface. Alternatively, some membrane proteins penetrate {{all the way through the}} bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside to the inside of the cell. The most common class of this type of protein is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs are responsible for much of the cell’s ability to sense its surroundings and, because of this important role, approximately 40% of all modern drugs are targeted at GPCRs.|$|E

5|$|The SS Medical Corps were {{initially}} {{known as the}} Sanitätsstaffel (sanitary units). After 1931, the SS formed the headquarters office AmtV as the central office for SS medical units. An SS medical academy was established in Berlin in 1938 to train Waffen-SS physicians. SS medical personnel did not often provide actual medical care; their primary responsibility was medicalized genocide. At Auschwitz, about three-quarters of new arrivals, including almost all children, women with small children, all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit were killed within hours of arrival. In <b>their</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> Desinfektoren (disinfectors), SS doctors also made selections among existing prisoners as to their fitness to work, and supervised the killing of those deemed unfit. Inmates in deteriorating health were examined by SS doctors, who decided {{whether or not they}} would be able to recover in less than two weeks. Those too ill or injured to recover in that time frame were killed.|$|E
