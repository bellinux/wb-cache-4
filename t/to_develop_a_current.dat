40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>current</b> and {{comprehensive}} model of physician job satisfaction. Information was gathered by (1) analysis of open-ended responses from a large group practice physician survey in 1988, and (2) analysis of focus group data of diverse physician subgroups from 1995. Participants were 302 physicians from large-group practices and 26 participants in six focus groups of HMO, women, minority, and inner-city physicians. Data were used to develop a comprehensive model of physician job satisfaction. The large group practice survey data supported the key importance of day–to–day practice environment and relationships with patients and physician peers. Future concerns focused on the effect of managed care on the physician–patient relationship and the ability of physicians to provide quality care. Focus groups provided contemporary data on physician job satisfaction, reinforcing the centrality of relationships as well as special issues for diverse physician subgroups of practicing physicians. New variables that relate to physician job satisfaction have emerged from economic and organizational changes in medicine and from increasing heterogeneity of physicians with respect to gender, ethnicity, and type of practice.

40|$|Objective: <b>To</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>current</b> {{understanding}} {{of the differences in}} how physicians communicate with Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) patients in comparison to non-BME patients. Methods: Systematic searches of electronic databases and references lists were performed. Data from the included studies were extracted in line with the review’s aims, and the studies’ quality was assessed using a standardised criteria. Results: Sixteen studies were included. The results indicated that physicians communicated differently with BME patients compared to non-BME patients as a consequence of patients’ race. Physicians were found to show less participative and affective behaviours towards BME patients and black patients received more information giving behaviours than other ethnicities. Additionally, BME patients displayed less conversational behaviours in comparison to non-BME patients. Studies have also begun to relate other culture related variables to communication but their relationship was less established. Conclusion: While physicians’ communication behaviours varied across patients’ race, there still continues to remain a gap in relation to the literature base being able to sufficiently explain, (a) how race exerts its effect on physician communication and (b) what other variables can account for the differences in physicians’ communication. This gap may reflect the complexity of communication and the measures used. The review firstly reinforces the need for a diverse workforce and the necessity to incorporate affective dimensions of communication in physicians’ cultural communication training, and secondly, calls for future research to expand explanations beyond patients’ race...|$|E

Chapter 1 describes the herring resource, the existing fishery, and reviews current research into the international transboundary migrations of the Atlantic sea herring. Chapters 2 and 3 describe {{the development of the}} herring fishery management plan {{in the context of the}} global herring market and the management complications that arise from the transboundary migrations of the stocks. Examples of successful linkages between fisheries management and market development are described in Chapter 4 to illustrate the importance of incorporating these two elements into fisheries management plans. These management systems, largely drawn from other countries which encourage more local control and responsibility for sustaining fisheries resources, are summarized to illustrate options for inclusion in the draft U. S. Atlantic herring management plan. A proposal and justification for regional and/or 2 ̆ 2 community 2 ̆ 2 -based allocations of herring is presented in Chapter 5.

AbstractThe 2013 Defence White Paper includes security against major cyber attacks on Australia as an element of our ‘defence of Australia’ national strategic interest. It devotes a separate section to cyber in its strategic outlook. While the White Paper makes heartening comment {{about the need to}} integrate cyber power into national strategy, it provides no insights into how this might be achieved, nor does it set any real strategic direction for an improved whole-of-nation effort. It does not attempt to identify any cyber objectives that should underpin Australia’s national security strategy. Australia needs <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>current</b> baseline cyber posture, derive a consolidated view of all requirements and gaps, and develop future remediation and implementation plans in an integrated fashion. Without this, cyber capability gaps across the Australian Government will continue to hinder the agencies’ ability to plan for and conduct effective operations. Accordingly, this article calls for a comprehensive capabilities-based assessment, a national cyber capability plan, and an implementation plan (with specific actions and implementation responsibilities, timeframes, and performance measures) and a funding strategy for addressing any gaps resulting from the assessment. It also calls for a clearer articulation of operational planning considerations, including dealing with the conflation of electronic warfare and cyber warfare, and the use of uninhabited aerial vehicles for improved intelligence collection and network penetration...|$|E
40|$|A bstra c t-The {{practicality}} {{of designing}} a biascontrolled inductor, suitable for high frequency resonant mode Inverters and converters, In vestlgated theoretically and experlmen tally. The proposed variable Inductor Is {{built around a}} double 'E ' core structure with zero mutual coupling between the main Inductor windings and the bias windings. The theoretical analysis of this study lead to a simple equivalent circuit and closed form equations that express {{the relationship between the}} Inductance and the controlling bias current. Excellent agreement was found between model predictions and experimental results. I. IN 1 RODUCTION Resonant [1] and quasi resonant [2] invener and converter topologies are believed to offer a better overall performance at high switching frequencies. One of the drawbacks of these resonant approaches is the non constant switching frequency. That is, the 'DC ' ttansfer function is normally controlled by varying the switching frequency. A close examination of this problem reveals, however, that the control variable is in fact the ratio of the switching frequency to the resonant frequency [1 - 3]. This implies that a constant frequency operation of resonant mode converters can be achieved if the resonant-rather the switching frequency-is controlled. The latter could be accomplished by designing the resonant network around a controllable inductor. The objective of this study was <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>current</b> controlled variable inductor that can be used as the resonant inductor in high frequency power conversion circuits. The proposed approach differs from the one described in [4] in that it is realizing a variable resonant inductor rather than variable transformer. Also, although basic ideas of the classical magnetic amplifier technology [5] are cenainly relevant to the problem on hand, they can not be directly implemented. This is mainly {{due to the fact that}} highfrequency high-power applications call for different solutions than those described hitheno for low frequenc...|$|E

Results obtained are from the open loop test and closed loop test. Two stages cascaded H bridge are created in which it uses 12 PWM signals for the switching scheme. PWM signals are generated by comparing a sine wave and triangular wave. Switching frequency for this project is chosen to be at audible range of 201 <Hz. PI controller is used for this project, {{in which it is}} set to control current at value of 0. 5 A and 0. 8 A. Current sensor is used for detection, in which it will output current value in terms of voltage. The sensitivity is around 40 mVlA and with starting value of 2. 5 V at OA. It is used for the measurement of the output current, in which it is processed inside microprocessor board, TI C 2000 TMS 320 F 28335 for controlling process.

40|$|Current {{understanding}} {{of the way in}} which females adventure and organise expeditions is widely unknown. This thesis explores the female concept of adventure with the intention to broaden the knowledge and awareness of women’s experiences in the Arctic. It is centred around the experiences of contemporary female adventurers who have completed self organised expeditions in the Arctic in all female teams. It specifically questions why these women chose the Arctic for their expeditions and what their definition of adventure is. Furthermore this study explores why women choose to journey in single gender groups and any significant meanings that they may draw from their experiences. It investigates any relationships these women may form while on an expedition specifically their connection to nature, how they function as a female only group in leadership and decision and how they gain sponsorship, grants and deal with social media. The purpose of this study is <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>current</b> {{understanding of}} the way in which females’ adventure unravelling any components of adventure expeditions that may hinder or add to their involvement in the outdoors. This study was conducted within a feminist phenomenological framework which allowed a critical and reflective analysis of the women’s experiences to transpire. In correlation with the values of feminist research this paper strives to challenge the gender inequality that is rife within the adventure community. In-depth interviews were held with six women, these informants were chosen for their commitment to adventure and for fitting the selection criteria of having completed a self organised all female expedition within the Arctic. Three of the women are well-known internationally for their competitive contribution to ski sport and the other three interviewees are well known locally. A much richer interpretation of these women was gathered by intertwining the worlds of both women with a media profile and those without. All of the women are privileged in the sense that they are from western world nations and have the opportunity to adventure, which represents a weakness within this study...|$|E

Five varieties of Spanish and English, namely, standard Mexican, non-native and local Southern Arizona Spanish, code-switching, and Chicano-accented English {{were presented to}} heritage learners using audio-recorded voice samples. Evaluations were recorded on semantic differential scales designed to reflect two distinct attitude dimensions, solidarity and socio-intellectual status/prestige. In addition to quantifying language attitudes, the study attempted to establish correlations with demographic factors. Demographic surveys and student interviews further yielded information <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>current</b> description of heritage learners in a formal, classroom setting. Teacher interviews provided insights into program structure and teacher preparation. The ultimate pedagogical goal {{of this investigation was}} to define implications for heritage language instruction and for the preparation of teachers for this relatively new, yet growing field. A total of 238 students from programs for Spanish heritage learners in ten schools encompassing four districts, public and private, took part in the study. Structure and practices of heritage programs were found to differ widely, with teachers exercising considerable discretion over curriculum. Students were found to be 90 % recently arrived or second-generation students of Mexican, mostly Sonoran, background. Students expressed largely instrumental motivation for their pursuit of Spanish in school and 85 % planned to pursue higher education. Results indicate significant differences in students' attitudes between the normative and vernacular language varieties tested. In this academic setting, students' attitudes reflected a distinct preference for more standard varieties. The English test variety was ranked below these and above the vernaculars. Student-participants also showed sensitivity to fine distinctions in register and style. Gender of both speaker and listener were shown to affect language attitudes. Students' habits of language use, in particular the extent of outside reading and radio listening in Spanish, were significantly correlated with more positive language attitudes toward standard varieties. These habits also correlated with higher proficiency levels. These results engendered three salient implications for teaching and teacher preparation: the need to enhance students' outside reading and listening habits, the need to extend students' familiarity with divergent speech styles, the necessary inclusion of sociolinguistic underpinnings in teacher preparation...|$|E

To the extent possible, this pre-project assessment may utilize existing information from projects in comparable habitat types in locations close to the proposed project. The site-specific components and {{the duration of the}} assessment should depend {{on the size of the}} project, the availability and extent of existing and applicable information in the vicinity of the project, the habitats potentially affected, the likelihood and timing of occurrence of Threatened and Endangered and other Sensitive-Status species at the site, and other factors such as issues and concerns identified during public scoping. Each component is discussed below. The results of the information review and baseline studies should be reported to the affected stakeholders (e. g., state and federal wildlife agencies) in a timely fashion. Information Review Existing information on species and potential habitats in the vicinity of the project area should be reviewed and if appropriate, mapped. Sources of existing information should include resource agencies, local experts, recognized databases (e. g., Priority Habitats and Species [PHS] database), and data gathered at other nearby wind plants or other types of projects.

Prior to the study, there had been little systematic research of what information should be transferred to SBDC clients and the most effective methods for transferring that information. The small business growth stage literature was used to develop the recommended body of information. The adult learning literature was used to develop the recommended methods for transferring that information to clients. The majority of respondents were women, well educated, middle-aged, and from companies in service related industries that employed few workers. The findings suggest that clients desire an increase in both the appropriateness of the program 2 ̆ 7 s informational content and the level of their involvement in tailoring the SBM program to the needs of their organizations. As suggested by the Small Business Growth Stage Models, a statistically significant decline in client satisfaction of the program 2 ̆ 7 s informational content was found to exist between stage two and stage three business owners. The study found that instructors did not utilize specific business factors (such as sales levels, numbers of employees, etc.) in developing the informational content of the SBM programs. Instructors also did not utilize client preferred learning styles, or formal client involvement in developing the instructional design of the SBM program. The study found that clients and center personnel appear to differ in their perceptions regarding the role of the instructor and the purpose of the SBM program.

Current transformers are considered eyes for power system protection. Behaviours of protection systems depend largely on information fed to them by instrument transformers. Ferromagnetic current transformers have for many years provided practical method of current measurement, however there are limitations associated with current transformer operation:- notably, difficult in maintaining accuracy over {{the full range of}} operating conditions, and most particularly current transformers tendency to suffer saturation of iron core during severe faults, with accompanying severe ratio or loss of output. These limitations might lead to mal operation of protective relays due to distorted inputs from current transformers particularly in transient periods. This thesis involved studying the behaviour of current transformers in both steady state and transient periods. An emphasis being put on transient periods which are very crucial in behaviour of current transformers because transformation errors are greatest in these periods. Errors in current transformer transformation might affect operation of entire protection schemes. Maloperation of current transformers in transient periods have very bad effect on relay co-ordination and worst condition might be failure of protection scheme operation altogether. Over the past decades engineers have been trying <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>current</b> transformer model that would represent a current transformer well in transient periods. It has proved to be rather difficult {{to come up with a}} single detailed model that would satisfy all possible conditions. This is due to non-linearity of magnetising curve and saturation effects of current transformer iron cores. The author has considered different current transformer models with their merits and demerits being highlighted. It has been shown that different current transformer models have to be used when considering different operating conditions of a current transformer in a power system. ATP-EMTP an Electromagnetic Transient Program was developed in the sixties for the study of electromagnetic transients in power systems. It has proved to be a very useful tool in this regard. The program development is still going on today to accommodate a wide application in power systems. Several components have been developed to represent different components in a power system. It is only recently that there has been a growing interest to include modelling of protective equipment. This has been accelerated by the inclusion of MODELS in the EMTP program. This thesis explores the effect of transients taking into account different conditions like transient fault currents, effects of high frequency waves and surges. Effects of different types of burdens on current transformers were explored as well. Due to limitations of EMTP, simulation results are only applicable to current transformers with ARMCO M 4 oriented steel with ungapped cores. The author arrived at several conclusions. The most important conclusion is that mal operation of protective relays due to current transformer saturation can be avoided easily if proper current transformer selection is given priority in power protection design. EMTP package proved to be very useful and handy when studying transients though one has to be careful with numerical oscillations which might be present during simulations. Problems of numerical oscillations have been discussed under current transformer simulation tools...|$|E

A sign of the maturation of email and its dominance in commerce is the rise of how-to books on writing effective emails. This paper analyzes six of those recent texts <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> taxonomy of <b>current</b> prescriptive advice for email. It examines contextual issues as well as issues of content, such as structure and tone; format, such as length of paragraphs, forms of salutation and farewell, and use of emoticons and abbreviations; and grammar and correctness. It finds in the taxonomy evidence that implies some unique attributes in electronic language and areas where email may be creating pressure for change in the English language...|$|R
