5|$|A player {{capturing}} a piece immediately passes {{that piece}} to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place {{one of these}} pieces on the board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called dropping the piece. Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate; however, pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank. Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the board, always visible to all players of the game.|$|E
25|$|Benchtop {{table saws}} {{are the least}} {{expensive}} and least capable {{of the three major}} types; however, they can offer adequate capacity and precision for many tasks. The universal motor is not as durable or as quiet as an induction motor, but it offers more power relative to its size and weight. The top of a benchtop table saw is narrower than those of the contractors and cabinet saws, so the width of stock that can be ripped is reduced. Another restriction results from the top being smaller {{from the front of the}} tabletop to the rear. This results in a shorter rip fence, which makes it harder to make a clean, straight cut when ripping. Also, there is less distance from the front edge of the tabletop to the blade, which makes cross cutting stock using a mitre more difficult (the mitre and/or stock may not be fully supported by <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the blade). Benchtop saws are the smallest type of table saw and have the least mass, potentially resulting in increased vibration during a cut.|$|E
500|$|Her {{influence}} {{with the public}} was again demonstrated when sales of Riesling wine increased by 30% in the UK after she had incorporated it into her Coq au Riesling recipe on Nigella Express. In December 2007 she appeared on BBC's The Graham Norton Show and revealed that she had once eaten 30 pickled eggs for a £1,000 bet, saying [...] "How stupid to challenge me! I made them all put their money on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> me. The next day I had scrambled eggs for breakfast." ...|$|E
50|$|The Birchmere is {{a concert}} hall in Alexandria, Virginia, known for {{presenting}} performers in the bluegrass, country, folk, and jazz genres.

500|$|Leslie {{decides to}} confront Tammy directly, {{only to find}} Tammy {{seems to be a}} {{friendly}} woman who instantly agrees to let Leslie have Lot 48 as a [...] "professional courtesy". Impressed, Leslie brings Tammy to the parks department so she can talk to Ron and work out their differences. Tammy and an agitated Ron go off to have coffee, and Donna (Retta) insists to Leslie that the arrangement is a mistake because the two act crazy when they are together. At a local diner, Ron and Tammy immediately start a very loud argument {{in front of the other}} patrons. Moments later, however, the two are publicly making out on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> everyone. The two rush off to a motel, where they frantically remove their clothing before even entering the building.|$|E
500|$|Several {{witnesses}} later {{reported that}} they heard a loud gunshot at approximately 15:30. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, opened the study door with Bormann at his side. Linge later stated that he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds, which is a common observation {{in the presence of}} prussic acid (the aqueous form of hydrogen cyanide). Hitler's adjutant, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche, entered the study and found the two lifeless bodies on the sofa. Eva, with her legs drawn up, was to Hitler's left and slumped away from him. Günsche stated that Hitler [...] "... sat... sunken over, with blood dripping out of his right temple. He had shot himself with his own pistol, a Walther PPK 7.65". The gun lay at his feet and according to SS-Oberscharführer Rochus Misch, Hitler's head was lying on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him. Blood dripping from Hitler's right temple and chin had made a large stain on the right arm of the sofa and was pooling on the carpet. According to Linge, Eva's body had no visible physical wounds, and her face showed how she had died—by cyanide poisoning. Günsche and SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke stated [...] "unequivocally" [...] that all outsiders and those performing duties and work in the bunker [...] "did not have any access" [...] to Hitler's private living quarters during the time of death (between 15:00 and 16:00).|$|E
2500|$|Officer's skat (German: [...] ) is {{a variant}} for two players. Each player gets 16 cards on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him, 8 facing down and 8 {{on top of}} each of them with face shown. Bidding is {{replaced}} by declaring a game type and trump by the companion. When a top card is played, the hidden card is uncovered, making a total of 16 tricks in that game. Scoring is like normal skat.|$|E

60|$|Amy led the way, and {{all went}} down more quietly than they came up, {{especially}} Helen and Hoffman. An excellent lunch waited {{on one of}} <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> old gateway, and having done justice to it, the major made himself comfortable with a cigar, bidding the girls keep near, for they must be off in half an hour. Hoffman went to see to the horses, Casimer strolled away with him, and the young ladies went to gather wild flowers {{at the foot of}} the tower.|$|R
6000|$|... "At the theatres, eh?" [...] sighed the Countess. [...] "At the cafés-concerts, at <b>the</b> little <b>tables</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> doors? Quelle existence! You know I am a Parisienne, monsieur," [...] she added, [...] "to my fingertips." ...|$|R
2500|$|Starting {{with the}} {{player on the}} dealer's left, each player in turn lays one card face up on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him or her, stating the count—that is, the {{cumulative}} value of the cards that have been laid (for example, the first player lays a five and says [...] "five", the next lays a six and says [...] "eleven", and so on)—without the count going above 31. The cards are not laid in {{the centre of the}} table as, {{at the end of the}} [...] "play," [...] each player needs to pick up the cards they have laid.|$|E
2500|$|Sun Quan responded, [...] "The old villain has harboured the {{intention}} of usurping the Han dynasty for a long time, but he feared the two Yuans (Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu), Lü Bu, Liu Biao and me. Now, all the others have been destroyed and I'm the only one left. The old villain and me cannot coexist together. Your idea of going to war coincides closely with my thoughts. This {{is a sign that}} Heaven has granted you to me." [...] He then drew his sword, slashed <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him and said, [...] "Any of you who dares to speak of surrendering to Cao Cao shall end up like this table!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Randi has {{appeared}} on numerous TV shows, sometimes to directly debunk the claimed abilities of fellow guests. In a 1981 appearance on That's My Line, Randi appeared opposite claimed psychic James Hydrick, {{who said that he}} could move objects with his mind and appeared to demonstrate this claim on live television by turning a page in a telephone book without touching it. Randi, having determined that Hydrick was surreptitiously blowing on the book, arranged foam packaging peanuts on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the telephone book for the demonstration. This prevented Hydrick from demonstrating his abilities, which would have been exposed when the blowing moved the packaging. Randi writes that, eventually, Hydrick [...] "confessed everything".|$|E
50|$|At the 2013 Jeux de la Francophonie, the {{athletics}} {{events were}} held at Stade Charles-Ehrmann from September 10 to September 14. The host country, France, topped <b>the</b> medal <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Poland and Canada. A total of 8 Games records was bettered during the competition.|$|R

60|$|Darkness spread swiftly {{across the}} lagoon {{and a white}} fog, hot and damp as steam, rose from the forest and hung about the ship. Everything was very quiet, for the men were too limp to talk, but a murmur {{came out of the}} {{distance}} where the long swell beat upon the shoals. Kit and Mayne sat in the chart-room, with a jug of iced liquor on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front.</b> Sometimes they spoke a few words and sometimes smoked in silence, while Adam lay on the settee, saying nothing. At length, he got up and a steward helped him to his room. Somehow the others felt it a relief that he had gone.|$|R

50|$|European-style dealers touch {{only the}} top of each card being dealt. The card is pushed {{off the top of the}} deck to <b>the</b> <b>table</b> surface <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> dealer. The dealer then propels the card toward the recipient, usually imparting some spin to the card to {{encourage}} sliding.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> marble <b>table,</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> Virgin, {{probably}} quotes {{the tomb}} of Piero and Giovanni de' Medici in the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence, which Verrocchio had sculpted during this same period. Some immature hesitancies are usually noted, especially the Virgin's ambiguous spatial relation to the desk and the marble on which it rests.|$|R

50|$|Cochrane wrote {{a letter}} to NYPD Police Commissioner Robert J. McGuire on November 15, 1981, informing him of his intent to testify before the City Council on the matter, which he did at <b>the</b> witness <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> council five days later.

They were exactly similar one to the other: both encased in plain black leather sheaths, with steel ferrules polished to shine like silver; the handles too were of plain steel, with just the grip fashioned in a twisted basket pattern of the same highly-tempered metal.|$|R
5000|$|Once dummy is laid out, {{the play}} of the cards {{continues}} in clockwise fashion with declarer stating the card to be played from the dummy followed by the partner of the opening leader playing his card and finally by declarer playing his.
