And the thing is, what she had talked about as well, is that before a concert, what she finds very interesting is the rehearsals and the straining and maybe {{she would like to}} injure. [...] And she said that the process of making the concert became more intriguing than the final result." ...|$|E

[...] After initially exercising the stable's race {{horses in the}} early months of her pregnancy, she moved over to ponying and other activities. [...] , she and Sharp currently hope to have two children fairly close together, and after that, Napravnik has not ruled out a return to race riding but has not made any firm decisions. As she explained in February 2015, [...] "I'm satisfied with the accomplishments that I've made. If I feel like I really want to come back in a few years then I can do it. The greatest <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>I</b> don't have to." ...|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Dan Forcella from TV Fanatics {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of five. Forcella noted [...] "It has been four episodes now since the super team {{returned}} from Florida, and The Office still hasn't found its footing back in Scranton", {{and he called}} the outing [...] "another lackluster effort". [...] A review from CliqueClack was largely critical of the episode, calling it [...] "worse than usual" [...] and noting that the show had finally hit [...] "rock bottom". WhatCulture! Reviewer Joseph Kratzer felt that the episode's setting—outside of the office building—was detrimental to the episode. He wrote, [...] "The <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> in no way felt like any of what occurred in 'Fundraiser' needed to take place outside the Scranton branch and that’s really why a sitcom should move locations for an episode – because the story couldn't function without it. But this time it just felt like a cheap way to liven up a clearly very boring, uninspired, weak episode of television." [...] Screen Crave wrote, [...] "Those viewers of The Office that have scolded the show throughout the season for its varying degrees of sucking, {{are not likely to}} be changing their thinking after watching the latest episode." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{production}} on Half-Blood Prince, Warner Bros. executive Alan F. Horn {{announced that the}} seventh and final novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was to be split into two cinematic parts with Yates, once again, as the director. Yates spoke {{of the decision to}} appoint him {{as the director of the}} final films, remarking that [...] "they wanted to do a Harry Potter that felt ... more grown up. What's smart about the studio and the producers is they have always wanted to push it a bit. Chris Columbus did a wonderful job of casting and making this world incredibly popular. But rather than do more of the same, they said, 'Let's bring in Alfonso Cuarón and let him run with it. Then later, let's bring in David Yates, who's done all this hard-hitting stuff on TV.' It's a testament to their ambition to try to keep the franchise fresh. The bizarre <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> did one [...] and they asked me to stay for three more, so obviously they liked something." ...|$|E
