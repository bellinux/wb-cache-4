5|$|For {{many years}} after his death, Scott's status as <b>tragic</b> <b>hero</b> was unchallenged, and few {{questions}} were asked {{about the causes of}} the disaster which overcame his polar party. In the final quarter of the 20th century the expedition came under closer scrutiny, and more critical views were expressed about its organization and management. The degree of Scott's personal culpability, and more recently, the culpability of certain expedition members, remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|Lady Macbeth is {{a leading}} {{character}} in William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth (c.1603–1607). The wife of the play's <b>tragic</b> <b>hero,</b> Macbeth (a Scottish nobleman), Lady Macbeth goads her husband into committing regicide, after which she becomes queen of Scotland. Later, however, she suffers pangs of guilt for her part in the crime, which drives her to sleepwalk. She dies off-stage in the last act, an apparent suicide.|$|E

5|$|Germanicus and Tiberius {{are often}} contrasted by ancient historians, poets who wrote using themes found in drama, with Germanicus playing the <b>tragic</b> <b>hero</b> and Tiberius the tyrant. The {{endurance}} of the Principate is challenged in these narratives, by the emperor's jealous trepidation toward competent commanders such as Germanicus. Attention is paid particularly to their leadership styles, i.e., {{in their relationship}} with the masses. Germanicus is painted as a competent leader able to handle the masses whereas Tiberius is indecisive and envious.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Scott and {{his party}} overshadowed all else in the British public's mind, {{including}} Amundsen's feat in being first at the Pole. For many years the image of Scott as a <b>tragic</b> <b>hero,</b> beyond reproach, remained virtually unchallenged, for although there were rifts among some who were close to the expedition, including relatives of those who died, this disharmony was not public. There was no real change in public perceptions until the 1970s, by which time nearly all those directly concerned with the expedition were dead.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{influenced}} novelists such as Thomas Hardy, William Faulkner, and Charles Dickens. The American novelist Herman Melville's soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick is {{a classic}} <b>tragic</b> <b>hero,</b> inspired by King Lear. Scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare's works. These include two operas by Giuseppe Verdi, Otello and Falstaff, whose critical standing compares {{with that of the}} source plays. Shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites. The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli, a friend of William Blake, even translated Macbeth into German. The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology, in particular, that of Hamlet, for his theories of human nature.|$|E

5000|$|Acedia {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the literary criticism of Walter Benjamin. In his study of baroque literature, The Origin of German Tragic Drama, Benjamin describes acedia as a moral failing, an [...] "indolence of the heart" [...] that ruins great men. Benjamin considers acedia to be a key feature of many baroque <b>tragic</b> <b>heroes,</b> from the minor dramatic figures of German tragedy to Shakespeare's Hamlet: [...] "The indecisiveness of the prince, in particular, is nothing other than saturnine acedia." [...] It is this slothful inability to make decisions that leads baroque <b>tragic</b> <b>heroes</b> to passively accept their fate, rather than resisting it in the heroic manner of classical tragedy.|$|R

5|$|During the 2005–06 season, Duncan {{suffered}} from plantar fasciitis {{for most of}} the season, which was at least partly responsible for his sinking output (18.6 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 blocks per game), and also for his failure to make the All-NBA First Team after eight consecutive appearances. The big man came back strong in the 2006 NBA Playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks, where he outscored rival power forward Dirk Nowitzki 32.2 to 27.1 points, with neither Nowitzki nor Mavericks center Erick Dampier able to stop Duncan with their man-to-man defense. But after splitting the first six games, Duncan became the <b>tragic</b> <b>hero</b> of his team in Game 7. Despite scoring 39 points in regulation time and fouling out both Dampier and Keith Van Horn, Duncan only made one of seven field goal attempts in overtime against Mavericks reserve center DeSagana Diop, and the Spurs lost Game 7.|$|E
5|$|The Sandmans main {{character}} is Dream, the titular Sandman, also known to various characters throughout the series as Morpheus, Oneiros, the Shaper, the Shaper of Form, Lord of the Dreaming, the Dream King, Dream-Sneak, the Cat of Dreams, Murphy, Kai'ckul and Lord L'Zoril, {{who is the}} anthropomorphic personification of dreams. At {{the start of the}} series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence. The character's initial haughty and often cruel manner begins to soften after his years of imprisonment {{at the start of the}} series, but the challenge of undoing past sins and changing old ways is an enormous one for a being who has been set in his ways for billions of years. In its beginnings, the series is a very dark horror comic. Later, the series evolves into an elaborate fantasy series, incorporating elements of classical and contemporary mythology, ultimately placing its protagonist in the role of a <b>tragic</b> <b>hero.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{thematic}} source {{may have}} been William Baldwin's The Mirror for Magistrates (1559; 2nd edition, 1578), a well-known series of poems spoken by controversial historical figures who speak {{of their lives and}} deaths, and to warn contemporary society not to make the same mistakes they did. Three such figures are Margaret of Anjou, King Edward IV and Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York. York's final scene, and his last speech in particular (1.4.111–171), are often identified as being the 'type' of scene suitable to a traditional <b>tragic</b> <b>hero</b> who has been defeated by his own ambition, and this is very much how York presents himself in Mirror, a <b>tragic</b> <b>hero</b> whose dynastic ambitions caused him to reach too far and led to his ruin.|$|E

The <b>tragic</b> <b>heros</b> are in defeat of {{making sense of}} their world in Shakespeare’s tragedies Hamlet and Othello.

25|$|Perhaps as {{a result}} of this reading and seeing himself as an archetypical <b>tragic</b> <b>hero,</b> Berlioz began to weave {{personal}} references into his music.

25|$|Urubhanga is a Sanskrit play {{written by}} Bhasa in the 2nd or 3rd century AD with Duryodhana as its primary protagonist.

40|$|Rather than {{focusing}} on the obvious traditions of evaluating Shakespearean <b>tragic</b> <b>heroes,</b> this paper presents a groundbreaking approach to unfold the pattern William Shakespeare follows as he designed his unique characters. This pattern applies to most, if not all, Shakespearean <b>tragic</b> <b>heroes.</b> I argue that Shakespeare himself reveals a great portion of this pattern on the tongue of Lear as the latter disowns Goneril and Regan promising to have “such revenges on [them] both” in King Lear. Lear’s threats bestow four unique aspects that apply not only to his character but they also apply to Shakespearean <b>tragic</b> <b>heroes.</b> Lear’s speech tells us that {{he is determined to}} have an awful type of revenge on his daughters. However, the very same speech tells us that he seems uncertain about the method through which he should carry out this revenge. Lear does not express any type of remorse as he pursues his vengeful plans nor should he aim at amnesty. He also admits his own madness as he closes his revealing speech. This research develops these facts about Lear to unfold the unique pattern Shakespeare follows as he portrayed his major tragic figures. This pattern is examined, described and analyzed in King Lear, Othello, and Hamlet. We will find out that the pattern suggested in this study helps us better understand Shakespeare’s tragedies and enables us to provide better explanations for some controversial scenes in the tragedies discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{latter part}} of the 20th century saw the rise of multi-volume vampire epics. The first of these was Gothic romance writer Marilyn Ross's Barnabas Collins series (1966–71), loosely based on the {{contemporary}} American TV series Dark Shadows. It also set the trend for seeing vampires as poetic <b>tragic</b> <b>heroes</b> rather than as the more traditional embodiment of evil.
