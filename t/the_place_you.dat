500|$|The Prince-inspired [...] "Cross Dresser" [...] has a {{new wave}} style and {{whimsical}} lyrics in which the narrator holds on {{to the memory of}} his lost love by wearing her clothes. Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I just thought it was funny. It's {{one of those things that}} people talk about, but that's never really happened to me. But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes. It felt good ... It was really quick and I just thought it was something silly and funny." [...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a languid rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work your way through the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>you</b> come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If you follow the beaten path, it will keep you tied to the past." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1931, Weber {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an assistant coach at Michigan and continued in that position for 28 years. Hercules Renda, a Michigan fullback in the late 1930s, said: â€œWally Weber was the ideal freshman coach. [...] He would call you by <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>you</b> were from, and the state you were from. [...] Can you imagine? [...] Think of the memory that man had? [...] He would also use those big words. [...] That was Wally. [...] You were perfectly at ease with him at any time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson stated [...] "Of course {{everyone}} wants to sell records and be number one. And I think that's important. But {{for a lot of}} artists today, it's all about the money as opposed to the art. What happened to artists creating this wonderful body of music that touches people and changes their lives?" [...] In response to boycotted promotion, Jackson stated [...] "A lot of people said they didn't even know the project was out, and I think that {{had a lot to do}} with the response. Yet a lot of fans in Europe came up to me saying they absolutely felt it was my best album. There were all kinds of reactions to the album, and there was obviously a lot of drama surrounding that album as well." [...] Productions deadlines also caused Jackson to rush, saying [...] "Deadlines are hard for me; I don't like being forced to do things when you know you're not ready; when you're on the right path but you know you haven't gotten to <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>you</b> want to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song's melody {{grew out}} of some {{unstructured}} jamming on 7 January 1969 during rehearsal sessions on the sound stage at Twickenham Studios. Over the next few minutes, McCartney introduced some of the lyrics, reworking [...] "Get back to <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>you</b> should be" [...] from fellow Beatle George Harrison's [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] into [...] "Get back to where you once belonged". McCartney had played bass on Jackie Lomax's recording of [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] a few months earlier. On 9 January McCartney brought a more developed version of [...] "Get Back" [...] to the group, with the [...] "Sweet Loretta" [...] verse close to its finished version. For the press release to promote the [...] "Get Back" [...] single, McCartney wrote, [...] "We {{were sitting in the}} studio and we made it up out of thin air... we started to write words there and then... when we finished it, we recorded it at Apple Studios and made it into a song to roller-coast by." ...|$|E
