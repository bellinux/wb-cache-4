5|$|Feminist economists' work on {{globalization}} is diverse and multifaceted. But {{much of it}} is tied together through detailed and nuanced studies {{of the ways in which}} globalization affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes. Often country case studies are used for these data. Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization. For example, Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights, gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance, and policies that are sensitive to the proportion of women in <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> economy. Additionally, Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements, drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh. She argues that although these jobs may appear exploitative, for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> economy.|$|E

5|$|In September 1960 Bukovsky entered Moscow University {{to study}} biology.

5|$|In {{countries}} where {{women have to}} do paid work in order to feed their family, {{there is a lack}} of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to the large amount of informal work available. In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many women have jobs in <b>the</b> <b>informal</b> industry, and often do home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E

The Wehrmacht would thus cut off the French and Allied armies in Belgium and Flanders. This {{part of the plan}} later became known as the Sichelschnitt ("sickle cut"). Manstein's proposal also included a second thrust outflanking the Maginot Line, which would allow the Wehrmacht to force any future defensive line much further south.|$|E

5|$|This policy, {{known as}} malgachization, {{coincided with a}} severe {{economic}} downturn and a dramatic decline {{in the quality of}} education.

Excepting the brief presidency of Albert Zafy, from 1992 to 1996, Ratsiraka remained in power from 1975 to 2001 and failed to achieve significant improvements in education throughout his tenure.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Solid waste management in low income developing countries is generally {{the responsibility of the}} official sector, such as municipal corporations. However, there are extensive inputs from the from <b>the</b> private <b>informal</b> sector in waste collection, separation and recycling. Four different activities in <b>the</b> private <b>informal</b> sector have been studied to identify the potential of their integration with the official system. Where integration means that the official sector accepts those practices and incorporates them into existing practices and future plans. All the cases have been selected from the city of Karachi, Pakistan. A multiple case study approach was adopted to assess the potential for integration, constraints to integration, attitudes, relationships and dependencies. It has been concluded that under the present circumstances, <b>the</b> private <b>informal</b> activities in solid waste management cannot be integrated formally with the official system. The main constraints to integration are public and municipal attitudes, the interrelationships and dependencies, interference by politicians and the lack of understanding on the wide range benefits of integration. Future models must be developed on <b>the</b> private <b>informal</b> practices within <b>the</b> official systems, such as primary collection of waste through municipal sweepers. A number of benefits of <b>the</b> private <b>informal</b> practices were also highlighted by the research which may be considered as opportunities once integration takes place. The recommendations include a number of actions and potential policy changes which could be done to promote integration and a better partnership between <b>the</b> private <b>informal</b> and <b>the</b> public sector...|$|R
