Eve reveals this to Sam and Dean when they try to hunt her down. During the hunt, Eve is able to suppress Castiel's powers as she is older than him. After Dean kills Eve, Castiel's powers return and he kills all of her monsters with a blast of white light before transporting the group to the home of the uncle of two young boys who were turned into monsters. There, they find them dead, having been killed by demons, and Castiel promises to look into Crowley's possible survival <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> sure if he's dead or not. However, Castiel is instead seen with a very alive Crowley who states that he is [...] "tired of cleaning up after [...] messes", implying that Castiel had full knowledge of burning the wrong bones and that both he and Crowley have some sort of agreement between them and/or may be working together as partners.|$|E
