40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} an algorithm that can detect <b>the</b> <b>most</b> unusual <b>part</b> of a digital image in probabilistic setting. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> unusual <b>part</b> of a given shape is defined as a part of the image that has the maximal distance to all non intersecting shapes with the same form. The method is tested on two and three-dimensional images and has shown very good results without any predefined model. A version of the method independent of the contrast of the image is considered and is found to be useful for finding <b>the</b> <b>most</b> unusual <b>part</b> (and <b>the</b> <b>most</b> similar <b>part)</b> of <b>the</b> image conditioned on given image. The results can be used to scan large image databases, as for example medical databases. Comment: 16 page...|$|R
