40|$|We {{study the}} {{alignment}} of grains by radiative <b>torques</b> and pinwheel <b>torques</b> {{taking into account}} internal relaxations and thermal flipping. We identify with radiative <b>torques</b> the <b>torques</b> arising from anisotropic radiation, while all <b>torques</b> that are fixed in grain body axes, including the radiative <b>torques</b> arising from extinction of isotropic radiative field, we identify with pinwheel <b>torques.</b> We discuss new type of pinwheel <b>torques,</b> namely, regular <b>torques</b> arising from grain emission, as well as, pinwheel <b>torques</b> arising from the interaction of grains electrons in hot plasma. We show that both types of <b>torques</b> are long-lived, i. e. may exist longer than the grain damping time. We also show that the <b>torques,</b> first introduced by E.

The other two types of Purcell’s <b>torques,</b> namely, those arising from H 2 formation and variations of the grain accommodation coefficient, we identify with short-lived <b>torques,</b> although their actual life-time is rather uncertain. With the uncertainties in the amplitude of the <b>torques</b> and the variety of the astrophysical conditions involved, we consider separately {{the effect of the}} long-lived and short-lived pinwheel on the alignment induced by radiative <b>torques.</b> For long-lived pinwheel <b>torques,</b> we observe that new attractor points appear.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{alignment}} of grains subject to both radiative <b>torques</b> and pinwheel <b>torques</b> while accounting for thermal flipping of grains. By pinwheel <b>torques</b> {{we refer to}} all systematic <b>torques</b> that are fixed in grain body axes, including the radiative <b>torques</b> arising from scattering and absorption of isotropic radiation. We discuss new types of pinwheel <b>torques,</b> which are systematic <b>torques</b> arising from infrared emission and <b>torques</b> arising from the interaction of grains with ions and electrons in hot plasma. We show that both types of <b>torques</b> are long-lived, i. e. may exist longer than gaseous damping time. We compare these <b>torques</b> with the <b>torques</b> introduced by E. Purcell, namely, <b>torques</b> due to H 2 formation, the variation of accommodation coefficient for gaseous collisions and photoelectric emission. Furthermore, we revise the Lazarian & Draine model for grain thermal flipping. We calculate mean flipping timescale induced by Barnett and nuclear relaxation for both paramagnetic and superparamagnetic grains, {{in the presence of}} stochastic <b>torques</b> associated with pinwheel <b>torques,</b> e. g. the stochastic <b>torques</b> arising from H 2 formation, and gas bombardment. We show that the combined effect of internal relaxation and stochastic <b>torques</b> can result in fast flipping for sufficiently small grains and, because of this, they get thermally trapped, i. e. rotate thermally in spite of the presence of pinwheel <b>torques.</b> For sufficiently large grains, we show that the pinwheel <b>torques</b> can increase the degree of grain alignment achievable with the radiative <b>torques</b> by increasing the magnitude of the angular momentum of low attractor points and/or by driving grains to new high attractor points.

5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated <b>torque</b> while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting <b>torque</b> from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant <b>torque</b> is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E

In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the peak and average <b>torques</b> {{produced}} by the knee extensors during continuous concentric-eccentric cycles at angular velocities of 45, 90, 135, and 180 /s.

Peak <b>torques</b> were significantly greater than average <b>torques,</b> and eccentric <b>torques</b> were significantly greater than concentric <b>torques</b> at all angular velocities (p < 0. 01). As angular velocity increased, concentric peak and average <b>torques</b> decreased (- 26 % and - 21 %, respectively), whereas eccentric <b>torques</b> varied only slightly (3 % and 5 %, respectively).

5|$|Once a turn is established, the <b>torque</b> {{that must}} {{be applied to the}} {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it to tend to steer into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a <b>torque</b> is applied in the opposite direction of the turn. At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it to tend to steer out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a <b>torque</b> is applied {{in the direction of the}} turn. At the capsize speed no input steering <b>torque</b> is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E
5|$|One <b>torque</b> {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning <b>torque,</b> is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip {{along the length of}} the contact patch. The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a <b>torque</b> on the tire. Since the direction of the side-slip is towards the outside of the turn, the force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this <b>torque</b> tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the side-slip, away from the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to increase the radius of the turn.|$|E
