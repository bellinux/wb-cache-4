5|$|It {{has been}} 4 {{days since the}} crash, September 25, 2004. Locke awakens from Oceanic Flight 815's crash and wiggles his toes, realizing that {{he is no longer}} paralyzed. Boars raid the body-filled fuselage, causing Jack to decide it should be burned. The next day, the {{survivors}} discover that their food is exhausted, and wonder what to do. Locke reveals to hold many hunting knives, and suggests <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> boar in the jungle. On his hunting mission, Locke is accompanied by Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) – who was given by Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) an antenna, which after being set will help triangulate the signal of the French transmission heard two days before – and Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau).|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 2010 Walton filmed {{her final}} scenes for the series, {{along with two}} fellow cast members Scare and Gerard McCarthy (who plays Kris Fisher). She spoke of her upset over leaving her fellow cast members, but later said she {{was looking forward to}} {{pursuing}} other projects. Walton also confirmed that she was happy the door was left open for a potential return, stating that she would consider reprising her role as Loretta in the future. Walton also said she understood why Marquess axed her character, he did not feel Loretta had anywhere left <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> cancellation of her main storyline. However, she also felt like she deserved another chance to prove herself.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} effect of Peterloo was {{a crackdown on}} reform. The government instructed the police and courts <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> journalists, presses and publication of the Manchester Observer. Wroe {{was arrested and charged}} with producing a seditious publication. Found guilty he was sentenced to twelve months in prison and fined £100. Outstanding court cases against the Manchester Observer were rushed through the courts and a continual change of sub-editors was not sufficient defence against a series of police raids, often on the suspicion that someone was writing a radical article. The Manchester Observer closed in February 1820.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, {{in order}} to attain these goals, Syed {{launched}} the Aligarh Movement, of which Aligarh was the center.

25|$|Costas' {{decision}} to be positive rather than negative has been viewed by some in both political parties as a weakness, a lack of the killer instinct. Some have said that Costas is too nice to be a politician. Some have charged {{that it was a}} political mistake not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> mayor (Butterfield) on the Pratt deal when Costas had the chance. Maybe. We'll never know if Costas might have won if he had been a more typical political campaigner.|$|E

25|$|The Great Goblin was a Goblin {{leader who}} lived in the Misty Mountains during the Third Age, as recounted in The Hobbit. His {{followers}} captured Thorin Oakenshield, Bilbo and company during the Quest of Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, and took them to their underground stronghold, Goblin-town. When he found the group was carrying Orcrist, an Elf-made blade which had killed many Goblins, he gave orders for them to be imprisoned and tortured. He tried to attack Thorin, but was slain by Gandalf. His death incites the Goblins <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> company.|$|E

25|$|The {{failure to}} relieve Fort Loudon forced the {{garrison}} to surrender with Captain Demeré and the garrison allowed {{to retain their}} arms and enough ammunition {{to make the trip}} back to the colony provided they left the remaining arms and stores of ammunition to the Cherokee led by Ostenaco. The garrison marched out of the fort on August 9 with a Cherokee escort. The Indians entered the fort and found 10 bags of powder and ball buried and the cannon and small arms thrown in the river to keep them from the Cherokee. Some of the Indians, angered by the broken agreement, held a secret council and decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> garrison.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{week in the}} Sprint All-Star Race, Earnhardt battled a tight handling car much of that night before finishing 7th. The {{following week}} for the Coca-Cola 600, Earnhardt lost an engine and finished 39th, giving him his first DNF since 2011. The next two weeks saw a rebound, with finishes of 10th at Dover and 3rd at Pocono. At the Quicken Loans 400, Earnhardt led 23 laps but suffered an engine failure, and finished 37th in what was the lowest point of the season for the Hendrick Motorsports teams as a whole (Kasey Kahne and Jeff Gordon both had DNFs due to crashes, and Jimmie Johnson cut a tire with 5 laps <b>to</b> <b>go).</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> low of Michigan, Earnhardt had a 12th-place finish at Sonoma.|$|E
25|$|Lisch's {{production}} {{dropped off}} as the 2016–17 season came to a close, with the Kings management putting {{it down to a}} mixture of niggling injuries, his workload, and the fact that he'd just come off an Olympic campaign with the Australian Boomers in August 2016. Aimed at resolving a nagging injury that curtailed his performance in 2016–17, Lisch underwent minor knee surgery during the off-season, with a healthy Kevin Lisch being the recipe for Sydney Kings success in 2017–18 according to Kings Managing Director Jeff Van Groningen. The Kings front office remained confident during the 2017 off-season that Lisch was the man for the job, despite calls for the Kings <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> likes of Jerome Randle or Casper Ware. After an off-season of rest and a training schedule refinement, Lisch entered the 2017–18 season ready to redeem himself.|$|E

25|$|Born as {{the second}} {{daughter}} of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, Drusilla grew up on Paradise Island along with her older sister, Princess Diana. After her sister left the island, she quickly became the finest archer and rider of the Amazons. When Hippolyta felt {{it was time for}} her elder daughter to return to the island, Drusilla was sent to America to urge her return. Reluctant to leave, Diana decided to show her younger sister of the need for Wonder Woman in the outside world. As part of this she convinced Drusilla to pose as Diana Prince's teenage sister for a few days. During this time she accompanied General Blankenship on a car trip. They were attacked by Nazi spies who abducted the general and left her behind. Unable to contact her sister, she decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> spies herself and transformed into Wonder Girl.|$|E
25|$|During {{the exodus}} from Egypt, the Hebrews follow Moses' {{original}} {{path through the}} desert and towards the Red Sea. Still grieving for his son, Ramesses decides <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Hebrews with his army. After making {{their way through a}} dangerous mountain pass, Moses and the Hebrews arrive {{at the edge of the}} sea, uncertain about what to do. Out of despair, Moses flings his sword into the sea, which begins to recede. Ramesses and his army pursue the Hebrews, but Moses stays behind to confront them. The Red Sea reverts to its normal state, drowning the majority of the Egyptians (crossing the Red Sea). Moses survives and makes his way back to the Hebrews. Ramesses is revealed to have survived, but he is distraught over the destruction of his army. Moses leads the Hebrews back to Midian, where he reunites with Zipporah and Gershom. At Mount Sinai, after seeing Malak's displeasure at the Hebrews' construction of the Golden Calf, Moses transcribes the Ten Commandments. Years later, an elderly Moses riding with the Ark of the Covenant sees Malak walking with the Hebrews through the desert.|$|E
25|$|Although {{he was the}} long-time {{favourite}} for the 2011 Epsom Derby, stamina doubts {{meant that}} Frankel did not run in what many consider racing's Blue Riband race. Instead, his next start was in the St. James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot on 14 June. In the race, the pacemaker, Rerouted, set a furious pace and opened up a sizeable lead by half-way. Frankel was then asked by jockey Tom Queally <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> leader and passed Rerouted shortly after the three-furlong marker, going on {{to open up a}} lead of six lengths {{on the rest of the}} field with two furlongs to go. However, in the final furlong, 20-1 shot Zoffany began to make up significant ground and Frankel eventually only won by three-quarters of a length. Following the race, Queally received criticism from a number of quarters for what some considered to be an ill-judged ride, since the mid-race move appeared possibly to have taken too much of a toll on the horse. Despite claims from Cecil and Queally that Frankel was merely idling in front, some observers saw the race as the first time the colt looked less than invulnerable.|$|E

Fabi drove for Peugeot Talbot Sport in their #1 Peugeot 905 Evo 1B-Peugeot SA35 3.5L V10 with Thierry Boutsen and Yannick Dalmas in the C1 Class. They started and finished second overall, with 374 points, and were also second in class.|$|R
25|$|A large {{percentage}} of pimps in the United States are also documented gang members, which causes concerns for police agencies in jurisdictions where prostitution is a significant problem. Pimping rivals narcotic sales as {{a major source of}} funding for many gangs; this is particularly true with African-American gangs. Gangs need money to survive, and money equates to power and respect. While selling drugs may be lucrative for a gang, this activity often carries significant risk as stiff legal penalties and harsh mandatory minimum sentencing laws exist. However, with pimping, gang members still make money while the prostitutes themselves bear the majority of the risk. Pimping has several benefits to the gang that the pimp belongs to. These benefits include helping the gang recruit new members because the gang has women available for sex and the money brought in by prostitution allows gang members to buy cars, clothes and weapons, all of which help to recruit younger members into the gang by increasing the reputation of the gang in the local gang subculture. The presence of gangs (and weapons and drugs) is a virtual guarantee when prostitutes are present, which is why many law-enforcement agencies advocate taking an aggressive stance against prostitutes. Many vice units work to ascertain if the prostitute they have arrested has a pimp, and if so, they pressure them to provide information about their pimp and the gang involved. This information can then be used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> more serious and violent offenders.|$|E

Russell T Davies explicitly links the Time Beetle to this villain from Sarah Jane, and in Doctor Who Confidential, a clip from the Sarah Jane episode in which the Trickster threatens <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Doctor is shown.

[...] It was discovered that Babcock sent coded letters to McDonald on how to run the ring in St. Louis. During the investigation McDonald claimed he gave Babcock $25,000 from the divided profits and even personally sent him a $1,000 bill in a cigar box.|$|E
