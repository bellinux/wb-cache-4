40|$|Experiments and {{numerical}} conjugate {{heat transfer}} simulations are performed {{on a simple}} <b>T-pipe</b> geometry. The <b>T-pipe</b> geometry is partially insulated and mimics subsea equipment which is subject to cool-down after a production shut-down. During flowing conditions the flow is turbulent before closing down and cool-down starts. After some time after shut-down the flow becomes near stagnant {{in parts of the}} geometry whereas it remains turbulent in the vertical section {{for a long time after}} shut-down due to large buoyant forces. Velocities were measured with particle image velocimetry (PIV), whereas temperature was measured using resistance temperature detectors (RTD's) and thermocouples. A particular focus is on the effect of using Reynolds-averaged Navierâ€“Stokes (RANS) turbulence models on a buoyant flow which is laminar, transitional and turbulent within a single fluid domain...|$|E
40|$|A {{steerable}} in-pipe robot {{based on}} screw drive is proposed for curved pipes and <b>T-pipes.</b> The robot {{with only two}} motors is composed of the drive mechanism and steering mechanism. The design principles of the robot are analyzed based on the kinematic and statics models. The spring parameters of the elastic arms are selected in consideration of the stability of steering motion. Then the steering locomotion control strategy in curved and <b>T-pipes</b> is given based on a simplified planar connecting rod model. In order to select a proper posture to turn, a posture adjustment strategy {{making full use of}} the pipe constraint is also proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed robot can pass through the curved pipes and <b>T-pipes,</b> and adjust the posture by the proposed control strategies...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} pipe shapes (L-bends, <b>T-pipes,</b> straight, etc.) are represented in the game. Leaky pipes can only {{be added to the}} end or over the last piece of another player's pipeline, and players cannot add to their pipeline until leaks are repaired. Leaks are repaired by either placing an intact pipe of the same shape over the leak or placing a wrench on the leak card. Repaired pipes cannot leak again. Play proceeds clockwise and new cards are drawn after cards are played. Players always have the option of exchanging a single card rather than playing a card.|$|R
40|$|Abrasive {{blasting}} is {{an important}} surface treatment process. Aiming at overcoming the shortage of the manual abrasive blasting process for large diameter pipe bends, <b>T-pipes</b> and gas collecting tubes, this paper presents the study of automatic abrasive blasting for large diameter pipe bends. According to the requirement of blasting process of large diameter pipe bend, the 5 -DOF orthogonal coordinate abrasive blasting mechanism is constructed. Due to the massive dust and serious wear, the seal and protective measures of the mechanism are fully considered. In order to maintain a reliable operation of abrasive blasting system in severe environment, an automatic control system based on PLC is designed. In order to keep a specific angle between the sand-blasting gun and the workpiece surface, which can improve the working efficiency, the surface tracking control model was constructed based on the infrared distance measuring sensors. In order to improve the measurement accuracy of the sensors, the second order linear fitting method based on the least square method was used to calibrate the infrared range sensors. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} proposed automatic abrasive blasting system has significance on improving sand blasting quality, working efficiency and environment as well as reducing labor costs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology and successful application of structural optimization of a <b>T-pipe</b> under transient thermal and mechanical loads. In {{order to find}} the optimal shape of a thick-walled power boiler component, a parametric FE model and the evolutionary algorithm (EA) are applied. The power boiler start-up and shutdown curves {{are based on the}} TRD 301 guidelines. Maximum total stresses are assumed as optimization constraints. The obtained geometry is by about 18. 6 % lighter than the original one due to thinning of the walls. Maximum tensile and compressive stresses in the modified geometry are smaller than in the original one during the whole cycle. Additionally, lower total stress values are recorded during heating and cooling processes. Therefore, these transient processes can be accelerated and the shutdown and start-up losses can be reduced...|$|E
40|$|Temperature {{fluctuation}} in fluid causes {{high cycle}} thermal fatigue in shroud structure {{according to its}} amplitude and frequency. There are still some incidents of thermal fatigue and leakage in light water reactors (Japanese PWR Tomari- 2 in 2003, French PWR CIVAUX in 1998), and also in sodium cooled reactors (French FBR PHENIX in 1992). Mixing tee is a typical component where temperature fluctuation occurs. An elbow is often used near the mixing tee and it brings biased velocity distribution and also the secondary flow, which decays unsteadily. Here, influence of upstream elbow in the main pipe was studied in the Water Experiment on Fluid Mixing in <b>T-pipe</b> with Long Cycle Fluctuation (WATLON) facility. Temperature distribution in the mixing tee was measured by a movable thermocouple tree and velocity field was measured by high speed PIV. Measured temperature showed that fluctuation intensity near the wall was larger in a case with the elbow than in a straight case under a wall jet condition where the jet exiting from the branch pipe was bent down to the pipe wall by high flow velocity in the main pipe. Measured flow velocity showed that biased flow velocity distribution and fluctuation due to the elbow influenced bending of branch pipe jet and the temperature fluctuation intensity around the jet...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} modelling the heating and cooling processes of <b>T-pipes</b> in a power plant pipeline in the start-up conditions of a boiler. The main purpose of this work is {{the description of the}} mechanical behaviour of power plant components working under mechanical and thermal loading and validation of the computer modelling methods. Design/methodology/approach: The FEM modelling has been used to describe the local stress-strain behaviour of the chosen component. Findings: The reasons for the presence of high and variable in time temperature gradients in the components of the main steam pipeline include, among other things, variable values of the coefficient of heat transfer between the pipeline material and the medium flowing inside it, which, at this stage of boiler operation, may change its state. Unsteady operation of a pipeline, especially in case of subsequent boiler start-ups, may induce thermal stresses which exceed the values of allowable stress in components of complex shapes. Research limitations/implications: The possibility of applying the durability criteria currently assumed in standards still requires justification and confirmation in laboratory and industrial conditions to be closer to the real components behaviour. In such situation the presented analysis is the part of the complex investigation method which main purpose is increasing accuracy of the TMF process description and thermo-mechanical life assessment. Practical implications: The calculations carried out may constitute a basis for developing a material test parameters which would bring closer the fatigue conditions appearing locally in the analysed components. The method of stress-strain behaviour analysis used in the paper could be useful in the practical cases when the real components mechanical behaviour would be analysed. Originality/value: The main value of this paper is the own method of the mechanical behaviour analysis of the power plant component. This method includes the temperature fields analysis taking into account the boundary conditions based on the operation parameter data and the thermoplastic material model. The material stress-strain behaviour has been treated as the local phenomenon, that could be modelled by FEM...|$|R
40|$|The {{process piping}} in the {{refinery}} plant {{does not always}} have straight pipe geometry. The configuration of these pipelines are usually zigzag or snake-like. The pipe fittings or joints including elbow pipes, blind-tee pipes, <b>T-pipes,</b> Y-pipes {{are found to be}} common in a refinery. One of the reasons why the pipelines are layed in zigzag or snake-like configuration is because of the limited space for the piping equipment even in the largest refineries. The aim of the thesis is to study the physical flow inside a pipe with focus on blind-tee and elbow pipes. Laminar flow regime with Reynolds number equals to 1000 is investigated in this study. The analysis utilizes CFD numerical simulations by using OpenFOAM to investigate the physical flow inside the studied pipes. The geometry of the pipes which are used in this study have a diameter (D) of 1 m, and the blind-tee length varied from 1 D to 5 D. In order to achieve the main objective, there are sub-objectives which need to be carried out. First, the laminar flow analysis of the straight pipe with a length 10 D is investigated as the base case of the study. Since the straight pipe is installed before and after the pipe joints in order to attain the fully developed desirable flow profile. Second, the geometry and mesh setup of the studied pipes are created by using Autodesk Inventor, GMSH and SALOME Software, starting with the straight pipe, and then followed by the blind-tee and elbow pipe. Third, the numerical analysis is carried out by performing OpenFOAM CFD simulations. Fourth, the sensitivity studies of different mesh elements, timesteps, and Reynolds number are carried out. Last, the results of the velocity profiles obtained from the numerical simulations are validated with the velocity profiles of laminar flow derived from the analytical solution of classical formula. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of fluid flow in the straight pipe, blind-tee, and elbow pipe are presented. In addition, the streamline, velocity contour, and pressure contour of the blind-tee and elbow pipe cases are shown. For the straight pipe case, the velocity profile in the pipe agrees well with the analytical solution of classical formula. For the blind-tee and elbow pipe cases, the velocity profile at the 5 D from the inlet and 5 D from the outlet have been checked for grid convergence studies. It is found that there are flow circulations, which occurs inside the blind-tee. Moreover, for the blind-tee with the tee lengths that are equal to 4 D and 5 D, fluid deposits would very likely occur, since the velocity inside this tee is very low...|$|R
