5|$|England {{then started}} their reply, and Lindwall took the new ball and felt {{pain in his}} groin again after {{delivering}} his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain.</b> Seeing that Lindwall was able to bowl <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> Bradman tossed the ball to Miller for the second over to see if Miller could bowl. However, Miller threw the ball back, indicating that his body {{would not be able}} to withstand it. This resulted in media consternation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E
5|$|Having {{struggled}} throughout 2015 {{with back}} problems, playing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> and medicating before matches, Dominguez sought the advice Dr. Miiller-Wohlfahrt in Munich in August. The doctor was astounded that Dominguez was still playing football as X-rays and MRI scans {{revealed that he}} had three herniated disks and further complications in his spinal canal. The full extent of Domínguez's back problems, which saw him undergo two operations, was such that during his time with Gladbach he missed 88 of the 194 games the team played {{while he was at}} the club.|$|E
5|$|Washbrook and Hutton then {{strode to}} the crease as England faced a short burst of Australian pace before the lunch break. Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin after {{delivering}} the first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered, and his first over was a maiden. Seeing Lindwall struggle <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> barrier, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller at the start off the second over {{to see if he}} could lift and bowl as well. However, Miller threw the ball back to his captain, indicating that his body would not be able to withstand the strain. This resulted in media speculation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E

5|$|After losing two {{finals in}} a row to Bellaghy in 1999 and 2000, Ballinderry won the 2001 Derry Championship, once again {{defeating}} Bellaghy in the decider. The club {{went on to win}} the 2001 Ulster Club Championship with victories over St. Gall's in the quarter-final (after a replay), Cavan Gaels in the semi-final and Mayobridge in the final.

Muldoon played <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> barrier in the Championship, delaying an operation on a troublesome hip injury until after the All-Ireland final.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, it was {{revealed}} that Kesler had been playing with a shoulder injury since February 2012. Suffering from a torn labrum, he underwent surgery for the injury in May. Initially expected to have recovered by mid-November, his rehabilitation was extended for several months due to an additional wrist injury which he received surgery for in late-June. As a result, he made his 2012–13 season debut on February 15, 2013, in a 4–3 loss to the Dallas Stars. Due to the NHL lockout, which cancelled the first four months of the season, Kesler only missed 12 games. Within seven games, however, Kesler was back on the injured reserve with a broken foot. He initially sustained the injury in his first game against Dallas, but subsequent X-rays came back negative. After playing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> for several games, an additional CT scan revealed the fracture.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{took the}} new ball and felt {{pain in his}} groin again after {{delivering}} his first ball. He persevered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> and removed Washbrook in his fourth over. Hutton then fell to Johnson to leave England at 32/2. Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich before doing the same to Dollery for a duck two balls later. England were 46/4 and Australia were firmly in control. Compton was joined by his skipper Yardley and the pair rebuilt the innings, scoring 87 runs together in 100 minutes. After the tea break, Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball. Compton edged Johnston to be out for 53. One run later, Lindwall bowled Yardley to leave England at 134/6 with their skipper dismissed for 44. Johnson then removed Evans for nine, before Coxon and Laker added 41 for the eighth wicket. After 85 minutes of resistance, Johnston removed both. England's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 9/207.|$|E
50|$|Peck defines {{discipline}} as {{the basic}} set of tools required to solve life’s problems. He considers these tools to include delaying gratification, assuming responsibility, dedication to the truth, and balancing. Peck argues that these are techniques of suffering, that enable <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of problems to be worked through and systematically solved, producing growth. He argues that most people avoid <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of dealing with their problems and {{suggests that it is}} <b>through</b> facing <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of problem solving that life becomes more meaningful.|$|R
50|$|Any form of methodical {{corporal}} punishment typically causes {{a high level}} of distress <b>through</b> <b>the</b> inflicted <b>pain</b> and <b>the</b> experience of being defenseless and unable to evade the situation.

30|$|One of the {{recurring}} reasons for periodic gambling abstinence was that gamblers needed {{to spend their}} time working to earn more money to gamble and to pay off debts. In addition, some gamblers reported that they abstained from gambling to appease family members who helped pay off their debts. Moreover, they also felt guilt for putting their family <b>through</b> all <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> and inconvenience.|$|R
5|$|The Second Test {{match was}} held at Lord's, but Miller was still unable to bowl when it began. He came in to bat in the first innings with Australia at 3/166 on the first {{afternoon}} after electing to bat. Bedser bowled three consecutive outswingers; the fourth ball swung the other way, and Miller was hit on the pads not offering a shot, believing that the ball would have curved away past the stumps. The umpire upheld England's appeal for leg before wicket (lbw) and Miller was out for four. O'Reilly blamed Miller's poor form with the bat on an excessive bowling workload imposed on him by Bradman. Australia made 350, but suffered a blow when Lindwall's injury flared {{up in the first}} over; Lindwall played on <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain.</b> Bradman threw Miller the ball, hoping that the all rounder would reverse his decision not to bowl and take inspiration from Lindwall. The injured bowler returned the ball, citing his back. His gesture generated news headlines among journalists who believed that he had disobeyed Bradman.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{took the}} new ball and felt {{pain in his}} groin again after {{delivering}} his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain.</b> He had Washbrook caught behind for eight in his fourth over. Hutton then played outside a Johnson off break and was bowled for 20 to leave England at 32/2. Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich before doing the same to Dollery for a duck two balls later. England were 46/4 and Australia were firmly in control. Compton was joined by his skipper Yardley and the pair rebuilt the innings, scoring 87 runs together in 100 minutes. After the tea break, Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball. Compton edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller took a low catch, dismissing him for 53. One run later, Lindwall clipped Yardley's off stump with the first ball of the over to leave England at 134/6 with their skipper dismissed for 44. Johnson then removed Evans for nine, before Coxon and Laker put on a 41-run stand for the eight wicket. After 85 minutes of resistance, Coxon hit a catch back to Johnson and Laker was caught behind from the same bowler, having already been dropped twice. England's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 9/207.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall was {{subjected}} to a thorough fitness test {{on the morning of}} the Second Test at Lord's two weeks later, the home of cricket. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations was sufficient to convince his captain to gamble on his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover. Lindwall contributed 15 to Australia's total of 350. He then took the new ball and felt pain in his groin again after delivering his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain.</b> He had Washbrook caught behind in his fourth over and then clean bowled Edrich and Tom Dollery in the space of three balls. England were 4/46 and Australia firmly in control. He later returned to bowl English captain Norman Yardley after an 87 run stand with Compton, before finishing with 5/70 as Australia took a 135 first innings lead. Lindwall then contributed 25 as Australia declared at 7/460 immediately upon his dismissal, leaving England to chase a world-record 596 for victory. Lindwall removed Hutton with the new ball and later returned to remove Dollery and Jim Laker without the addition of a single run to take 3/61 as Australia took a 409 run victory. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he pretended not to notice Lindwall's pain. Lindwall was worried that Bradman had noticed his injury, but Bradman later claimed that he feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax.|$|E
