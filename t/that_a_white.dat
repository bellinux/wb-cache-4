5|$|On {{their first}} stop ashore at St Jago in Cape Verde, Darwin found <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> band {{high in the}} {{volcanic}} rock cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy {{had given him the}} first volume of Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, which set out uniformitarian concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods, and Darwin saw things Lyell's way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology.|$|E
5|$|The racial {{segregation}} of local schools {{meant that the}} nearest white school was several miles away; Bakshi obtained his mother's permission to attend the nearby black school with his friends. Bakshi was the only white student in the classroom. Most {{of the students had}} no problem with Bakshi's presence, but a teacher sought advice from the principal, who called the police. Fearing that segregated whites would riot if they learned <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> student was attending a black school, the police removed Bakshi from his classroom. Meanwhile, his father had been suffering from anxiety attacks. Within a few months, the family moved back to Brownsville, where they rarely spoke of these events.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the massacre, {{the town}} of Rosewood had been a quiet, {{primarily}} black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of unsupported accusations <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> woman in nearby Sumner had been beaten and possibly raped by a black drifter. When the town's black citizens rallied together to defend themselves against further attacks, a mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people, and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. Survivors from the town hid for several days in nearby swamps until they were evacuated by train and car to larger towns. Although state and local authorities {{were aware of the}} violence, no arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black residents; none ever moved back.|$|E

5|$|Such densities are {{possible}} because white dwarf material is not composed of atoms joined by chemical bonds, but rather {{consists of a}} plasma of unbound nuclei and electrons. There is therefore no obstacle to placing nuclei closer than normally allowed by electron orbitals limited by normal matter. Eddington wondered what would happen when this plasma cooled and the energy to keep the atoms ionized was no longer sufficient. This paradox was resolved by R. H. Fowler in 1926 by an application of the newly devised quantum mechanics. Since electrons obey the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons can occupy the same state, and they must obey Fermi–Dirac statistics, also introduced in 1926 to determine the statistical distribution of particles which satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle. At zero temperature, therefore, electrons can not all occupy the lowest-energy, or ground, state; {{some of them would}} have to occupy higher-energy states, forming a band of lowest-available energy states, the Fermi sea. This state of the electrons, called degenerate, meant <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf could cool to zero temperature and still possess high energy.|$|E

During the debate when the announcement was made, Conservative MPs complained that metrication was being introduced by stealth.|$|E
25|$|His first {{professional}} performance was playing drums at a night club. Pryor {{served in the}} U.S. Army from 1958 to 1960, but spent virtually the entire stint in an army prison. According to a 1999 profile about Pryor in The New Yorker, Pryor was incarcerated for an incident that occurred while stationed in Germany. Angered <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> soldier was overly amused at the racially charged sections of Douglas Sirk's movie Imitation of Life (1959), Pryor and some other black soldiers beat and stabbed him, though not fatally.|$|E
25|$|Jonas Trinkūnas, {{the leader}} of a neo-pagan {{movement}} Romuva, believes that in the Lithuanian mythology Vytis represents Perkūnas, a god of thunder. It is believed that the Vytis may represent Perkūnas as supreme god or Kovas who was also a war god and has been depicted as a horseman since ancient times. Gintaras Beresnevičius also points out <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> horse had a sacral meaning to Balts. These interpretations coincide with one of the interpretations of the German coat of arms, that suggests an adler being the bird of Odin, a god of war, which is commonly depicted as a horserider.|$|E

25|$|When {{the city}} {{became a major}} center for defense {{shipbuilding}} during World War II, {{tens of thousands of}} rural Texans migrated there for the new high-paying jobs. The Roosevelt administration ordered the defense industry to be integrated, and many Southern whites were working closely with blacks for the first time. Housing was scarce in the crowded city, and racial tensions increased. In June 1943 after workers at the Pennsylvania shipyard in Beaumont learned <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> woman had accused a black man of raping her, nearly 2,000 went to the jail where a suspect was being held, attracting more men along the way and reaching a total of 4,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{initial fire}} from the mortars on shore was inaccurate, but a Signal Corps officer in Beaufort, Lieutenant William J. Andrews, acting on his own responsibility, was able to deliver {{messages}} to the battery commanders telling them how to adjust their range. After noon, virtually all shots were on target. Nineteen guns were dismounted. The walls of the fort began to crumble under the continued pounding, and in mid-afternoon Colonel White began to fear that the magazine would be breached. At 4:30p.m., he decided that the fort could no longer hold out, so he ordered <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> flag be raised. Firing on both sides then ceased.|$|E
25|$|After Michael Donald was lynched in 1981 in Alabama, the FBI {{investigated}} his death. The US Attorney prosecuted the case. Two local KKK {{members were}} convicted for his murder, including Henry Francis Hays, who {{was sentenced to}} death. With the support of attorneys Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and State Senator Michael A. Figures, Donald's mother Beulah Mae Donald sued the KKK in civil court in Alabama. Her lawsuit against the United Klans of America was tried in February 1987. After exhausting the appeals process, Hays was executed by electric chair for Donald's death in Alabama on June 6, 1997. It {{was the first time}} since 1913 <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> man had been executed in Alabama for a crime against an African American.|$|E

25|$|Once Warner Bros. {{agreed to}} the project, they {{initially}} wanted Academy Award-nominated Canadian film director Norman Jewison to direct the film. Jewison, director of the seminal civil rights film In the Heat of the Night, {{was able to bring}} Denzel Washington into the project to play Malcolm X. Jewison and Washington previously worked together in the 1984 film A Soldier's Story. A protest erupted over the fact <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> director was slated to make the film. Spike Lee {{was one of the main}} voices of criticism; since college, he had considered a film adaption of The Autobiography of Malcolm X to be a dream project. Lee and others felt that it was appropriate that only a black person should direct Malcolm X.|$|E
25|$|When {{the film}} was released, riots broke out in Boston, Philadelphia, and other major cities in the United States. The film's {{inflammatory}} nature was a catalyst for gangs of whites to attack blacks. On April 24, 1916, the Chicago American reported <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> man murdered a black teenager in Lafayette, Indiana after seeing the film, {{although there has been}} some controversy as to whether the murderer had actually seen The Birth of a Nation. The mayor of Cedar Rapids, Iowa was the first of twelve mayors to ban the film in 1915 out of concern that it would promote race prejudice, after meeting with a delegation of black citizens. The NAACP set up a precedent-setting national boycott of the film, likely seen as the most successful effort. Additionally, they organized a mass demonstration when {{the film was}} screened in Boston, and it was banned in three states and several cities.|$|E
