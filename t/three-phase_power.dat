In case of induction machines, the <b>three-phase</b> real <b>power</b> PkΣ is set; it can be positive (generator) or negative (motor); the <b>three-phase</b> reactive <b>power</b> QkΣ is negative and depends on parameters of the machine (the known magnetizing impedances and voltage of machines). The windings of both types of AC machines are usually delta or ungrounded wye connected; thus, the corresponding admittances Ŷ_k^ 0 from Fig.  3 are equal to zero in most cases.|$|R

25|$|A dimmer is {{a device}} used to vary the average voltage applied to an instrument's lamp. The {{brightness}} of a lamp {{is proportional to}} its electric current, {{which in turn is}} proportional to the applied lamp voltage. When the applied voltage is decreased, a lamp's electric current will also decrease, thus reducing the light output from the lamp (dimming it). Conversely, a higher voltage will cause higher lamp current and increased (brighter) light output. Dimmers are frequently found in large enclosures called racks or dimmer racks that draw significant <b>three-phase</b> <b>power.</b> They are often removable modules that range from 20-ampere, 2.4-kilowatt to 100-ampere units.|$|E

This is then converted to direct current before being converted to three-phase electricity through one of three gate turn-off thyristors. Each bogie has three rectifiers, each connected to a transformer that is again connected to two inverters. The motors are three-phase asynchronous motors located in the bogie frame and equipped with regenerative brakes. There is also an auxiliary <b>three-phase</b> <b>power</b> supply which powers the compressor, pumps, ventilators and other auxiliary equipment, operated by four separate inverters. The controller is a 16-bit microprocessor that communicates using optical fibre cables. The rectifier, auxiliary rectifiers, controllers and the error and diagnostic system is of the same type as used on the NSB Class 70 multiple units.|$|E

Three Gorges uses Francis turbines. Turbine diameter is 9.7/10.4m (VGS design/Alstom's design) and rotation speed is 75revolutions per minute. This means {{that in order to}} generate power at 50Hz, the generator rotors have 80 poles per phase, for a total of 240 poles per rotor to generate 50Hz <b>three-phase</b> <b>power.</b> Rated power is 778 MVA, with a maximum of 840MVA and a power factor of 0.9. The generator produces electrical power at 20kV. The electricity generated is then stepped-up to 500 kV for transmission at 50Hz. The outer diameter of the generator stator is 21.4/20.9m. The inner diameter is 18.5/18.8m. The stator, the biggest of its kind, is 3.1/3m in height. Bearing load is 5050/5500 tonnes. Average efficiency is over 94%, and reaches 96.5%.|$|E

2500|$|Italian {{railways}} {{were the}} first in the world to introduce electric traction for the entire length of a main line rather than just a short stretch. The 106km Valtellina line was opened on 4 September 1902, designed by Kandó and a team from the Ganz works. The electrical system was three-phase at 3kV 15Hz. The voltage was significantly higher than used earlier and it required new designs for electric motors and switching devices. The three-phase two-wire system was used on several railways in Northern Italy and became known as [...] "the Italian system". Kandó was invited in 1905 to undertake the management of Società Italiana Westinghouse and led the development of several Italian electric locomotives. During the period of electrification of the Italian railways, tests were made as to which type of power to use: in some sections there was a 3,600V Hz <b>three-phase</b> <b>power</b> supply, in others there was 1,500VDC, 3kVDC and 10kVAC45Hz supply. After WW2, 3 kVDC power was chosen for the entire Italian railway system. 1,500 V DC is still used on some lines near France and 25 kV 50Hz is used by high-speed trains.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1930s, {{work was}} {{started on the}} {{construction}} of a by-pass canal for the Neckar. [...] This new canal had the effect of making the rocks of the Pfalzgrafenburg into an island once more. [...] For a time, the cliff was linked to the town via a millrace which had been artificially created, and the Neckar sped in front of the cliffs and the bridge over rocks which had been placed there to produce rapids. [...] (Pictures dating from 1640 and 1800 provide an interesting comparison.) [...] The building of the canal was given high priority – several houses and even the first commercial <b>three-phase</b> <b>power</b> station were demolished. [...] The original generator is now on display at the Deutsches Museum in Munich. Nearby, the Oskar von Miller Strasse (the westerly access road to the cement works) is a reminder of the power station’s previous location. Electricity has since been generated at the dam further upstream. [...] Parallel with the construction of the canal came the laying of a narrow gauge railway for the transportation of stone along the right bank of the river between the Lauffen cement works and the quarry at Neckarwestheim. The railway ceased operation in 1984, with the rails later removed to create a new footpath and cycle way. The engine is preserved on a playground near the old bridge beside the former railway track. [...] The quarry is now the site of the Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant (GKN). Between 1935 and 1938, work took place on the so-called ‘Neckar-Enz Line’ between Eberbach and Unterriexingen. [...] This was a series of fortifications designed to resist a possible attack from the west. [...] Eleven bunkers were constructed in the Lauffen sector, none of which had any impact {{on the end of the}} war.|$|E
2500|$|The Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant (spring of 1891) and the {{original}} Niagara Falls Adams Power Plant (August 25, 1895) {{were among the first}} hydroelectric alternating current power plants. The first long distance transmission of single-phase electricity was from a hydroelectric generating plant in Oregon at Willamette Falls which in 1890 sent power fourteen miles downriver to downtown Portland for street lighting. [...] In 1891, a second transmission system was installed in Telluride Colorado. The San Antonio Canyon Generator was the third commercial single-phase hydroelectric AC power plant in the United States to provide long-distance electricity. [...] It was completed on December 31, 1892 by Almarian William Decker to provide power to the city of Pomona, California which was 14 miles away. [...] In 1893 he next designed the first commercial <b>three-phase</b> <b>power</b> plant in the United States using alternating current was the hydroelectric Mill Creek No. 1 Hydroelectric Plant near Redlands, California. [...] Decker's design incorporated 10kV three-phase transmission and established the standards for the complete system of generation, transmission and motors used today. The Jaruga Hydroelectric Power Plant in Croatia was set in operation on 28 August 1895. The two generators (42Hz, 550kW each) and the transformers were produced and installed by the Hungarian company Ganz. The transmission line from the power plant to the City of Šibenik was [...] long on wooden towers, and the municipal distribution grid 3000V/110V included six transforming stations. Alternating current circuit theory developed rapidly {{in the latter part of}} the 19th and early 20th century. Notable contributors to the theoretical basis of alternating current calculations include Charles Steinmetz, Oliver Heaviside, and many others. Calculations in unbalanced three-phase systems were simplified by the symmetrical components methods discussed by Charles Legeyt Fortescue in 1918.|$|E
