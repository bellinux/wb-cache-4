Alex {{introduces}} her mother to Dr. Linus because he's been hurt after being battered by Desmond. Danielle and Alex bring him home for dinner. While Alex is doing her homework, Danielle and Dr. Linus talk about her.

25|$|The {{influence}} of the Articles on Anglican thought, doctrine and practice has been profound. Although Article VIII itself states that the three Catholic creeds are a sufficient statement of faith, the Articles have often been perceived as the nearest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> supplementary confession of faith possessed by the tradition.|$|E

Before coming to Bete Noire, Slate was an officer in a northwestern African city called Maristan, which he says was even more corrupt than Bete Noire, until it was destroyed by a demon and vanished from human memory.|$|E
25|$|Manned {{models are}} {{considered}} by maritime pilots {{as the next}} best <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> full-scale prototype for understanding a ship's behaviour. Those who have trained on both claim that scale models are complementary to computer simulators. While manoeuvres with currents, waves, tugs, anchors, bank effects, etc. are reproduced more accurately on scale models, numerical simulators are more realistic {{when it comes to}} the bridge environment.|$|E
25|$|Wartime {{censorship}} prevented {{news of the}} storming of Government House in Darwin {{reaching the}} national press until the following Thursday afternoon. The news was received with great interest. The national press reacted in a predictable way, blaming a Soviet establishment in Darwin, to total anarchy, to an uncaring federal government and Gilruth himself. The rebellion was described as the nearest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> revolution since the Eureka Stockade at Ballarat in 1854.|$|E

25|$|In {{the period}} of the mythic past after the creation, Ra dwells on earth as king of the gods and of humans. This period is the closest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> golden age in Egyptian tradition, {{the period of}} {{stability}} that the Egyptians constantly sought to evoke and imitate. Yet the stories about Ra's reign focus on conflicts between him and forces that disrupt his rule, reflecting the king's role in Egyptian ideology as enforcer of maat.|$|E
25|$|During these investigations, {{numerous}} witnesses {{came forward}} with damning testimony, almost all of which was corroborated by other witnesses. One witness, Captain Silas Soule, who had ordered the men under his command not to fire their weapons, was murdered in Denver just weeks after offering his testimony. However, despite the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the Wars' recommendation, no charges were brought against those who committed the massacre. Chivington was {{beyond the reach of}} army justice because he'd already resigned his commission. The closest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> punishment he suffered was the effective end of his political aspirations.|$|E
25|$|The Israelite {{system of}} {{measuring}} area was fairly informal; the biblical text merely measures areas by describing how much land could be sown {{with a certain}} volume measure of seed, for example the amount of land able to be sown with 2 seahs of barley. The closest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> formal area unit was the yoke (Hebrew semed) (sometimes translated as acre), which referred {{to the amount of}} land that a pair of yoked oxen could plough in a single day; in Mesopotamia the standard estimate for this was 6,480 square cubits, which is roughly equal to a third of an acre.|$|E

25|$|The son of Constantine was T'oros I, {{who succeeded}} him in around 1100. During his rule, he faced both Byzantines and Seljuks, and {{expanded}} the Rubenid domain. He transferred the Cilician capital from Tarsus to Sis after having eliminated the small Byzantine garrison stationed there. In 1112, {{he took the}} castle of Cyzistra in order to avenge {{the death of the}} last Bagratid Armenian king, Gagik II. The assassins of the latter, three Byzantine brothers who governed the castle, were thus brutally killed. Eventually, there emerged a type of centralized government in the area with the rise of the Rubenid princes. During the twelfth century, they were the closest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> ruling dynasty, and wrestled with the Byzantines for power over the region.|$|E
25|$|He {{had gained}} near-total control of RKO {{by the end}} of 1954 at a cost of nearly $24million, {{becoming}} the closest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sole owner of a Hollywood studio seen in three decades. Six months later, Hughes sold the studio to the General Tire and Rubber Company for $25million. Hughes retained the rights to pictures that he had personally produced, including those made at RKO. He also retained Jane Russell's contract. For Howard Hughes, this was the virtual end of his 25-year involvement in the motion picture industry. However, his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed. During that time period, RKO became known as the home of film noir classic productions {{thanks in part to the}} limited budgets required to make such films during Hughes' tenure. Hughes reportedly walked away from RKO having made $6.5million in personal profit.|$|E
25|$|The {{environment}} in which the Inuit lived inspired a mythology filled with adventure tales of whale and walrus hunts. Long winter months of waiting for caribou herds or sitting near breathing holes hunting seals gave birth to stories of mysterious and sudden appearance of ghosts and fantastic creatures. Some Inuit looked into the aurora borealis, or northern lights, to find images of their family and friends dancing in the next life. However, some Inuit believed that the lights were more sinister and if you whistled at them, they would come down and cut off your head. This tale is still told to children today. For others they were invisible giants, the souls of animals, a guide to hunting and as a spirit for the angakkuq to help with healing. They relied upon the angakkuq (shaman) for spiritual interpretation. The nearest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> central deity was the Old Woman (Sedna), who lived beneath the sea. The waters, a central food source, were believed to contain great gods.|$|E

25|$|Luis Hernando de Larramendi gained no {{dedicated}} scholarly work; {{the closest}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> monograph are chapters dedicated {{to his father}} by Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi in his book, Así se hizo MAPFRE (2000). Though highly hagiographic, they provide the most detailed information available so far. Apart from well-known facts from his political career, the chapters offer also lots of private observations and recollections; they {{paint a picture of}} a Catholic taking communion almost every day, a profoundly idealist person, extremely sensitive to any sort of injustice and unrepentant in his political creed, but incapable of violence. Though humble and unpretentious, he is also portrayed as intolerant versus foolishness; this trait is considered moral defect, though also an obstacle in Larramendi’s professional and political career. Tending to solitude, he ran his law office on his own and was getting outpaced by modern legal companies; in terms of politics he built no personal following, relying entirely on his loyalty to the dynasty and trust in Traditionalist doctrine.|$|E

500|$|Commenting on the platform, Alan Dershowitz wrote, [...] "It {{is a real}} {{tragedy that}} Black Lives Matter — which has done so much good in raising {{awareness}} of police abuses — has now moved away from its central mission and has declared war against the nation state of the Jewish people." [...] He noted that Black Lives Matter is not monolithic and [...] "is a movement comprising numerous groups. ...

500|$|Regarding the {{commercial}} {{impact of the}} album, Entertainment Weeklys Margeaux Watson wrote, [...] "For a pop star who was once dismissed as being incapable of yielding more than one hit song per album, Rihanna's newfound staying power {{is nothing short of}} remarkable–and proof that there's room for more than one diva in this game." [...] Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic concluded that it was Good Girl Gone Bad that made Rihanna a [...] "full-fledged international pop star with a regular presence atop the charts". Nick Levine of Digital Spy described the album, as the closest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Thriller that 2007/08 is likely to produce.|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{finished}} the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois. Michael Gray {{wrote that the}} album was: [...] "Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s." [...] The track [...] "Most of the Time", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity, while [...] "What Was It You Wanted?" [...] has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans. The religious imagery of [...] "Ring Them Bells" [...] struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.|$|E
