40|$|The cis–syn dimer is {{the major}} DNA {{photoproduct}} produced by UV irradiation. In {{order to determine the}} origin of the mutagenic property of the cis–syn dimer, we used NMR restraints and molecular dynamics to determine the solution structure of a DNA decamer duplex containing a wobble pair between the 3 ′-T of the cis–syn dimer and <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>T</b> residue (CS/TA duplex). The solution structure of the CS/TA duplex revealed that the 3 ′-T·T base pair of the cis–syn dimer had base pair geometry that was significantly different from the canonical Watson–Crick base pair and caused destabilization and conformational distortion of its 3 ′-region. However, a 3 ′-T·A base pair at the cis–syn dimer within this related DNA decamer maintains the normal Watson–Crick base pair geometry and causes little distortion in the conformation of its 3 ′-side. Our results show that in spite of its stable hydrogen bonding, the insertion of a T residue opposite the 3 ′-T of the cis–syn dimer is inhibited by structural distortion caused by the 3 ′-T·T base pair. This may explain why the frequency of the 3 ′-T→A transversion, which {{is the major}} mutation produced by the cis–syn dimer, is only 4 %...|$|E
40|$|N 1 -meA and N 3 -meC are {{cytotoxic}} DNA base methylation lesions {{that can}} accumulate in the genomes of various organisms {{in the presence}} of SN 2 type methylating agents. We report here the structural characterization of these base lesions in duplex DNA using a cross-linked protein–DNA crystallization system. The crystal structure of N 1 -meA:T pair shows an unambiguous Hoogsteen base pair with a syn conformation adopted by N 1 -meA, which exhibits significant changes in the opening, roll and twist angles as compared to the normal A:T base pair. Unlike N 1 -meA, N 3 -meC does not establish any interaction with the opposite G, but remains partially intrahelical. Also, structurally characterized is the N 6 -meA base modification that forms a normal base pair with <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>T</b> in duplex DNA. Structural characterization of these base methylation modifications provides molecular level information on how they affect the overall structure of duplex DNA.

40|$|We report {{measurements}} of the anisotropy of the spin echo decay for the inner layer Cu site of the triple layer cuprate, Hg_ 0. 8 Re_ 0. 2 Ba_ 2 Ca_ 2 Cu_ 3 O_ 8 (T_c= 126 K) in the pseudogap T regime below T_pg 170 K and the corresponding analysis for their interpretation. As the field alignment is varied, {{the shape of the}} decay curve changes from Gaussian (H_ 0 ∥ c) to single exponential (H_ 0 c). The latter characterizes the decay caused by the fluctuations of adjacent Cu nuclear spins caused by their interactions with electron spins. The angular dependence of the second moment (T_ 2 M^- 2 ≡) deduced from the decay curves indicates that T_ 2 M^- 2 for H_ 0 ∥ c, which is identical to T_ 2 G^- 2 (T_ 2 G is the Gaussian component), is substantially enhanced, as seen in the pseudogap regime of the bilayer systems. Comparison of T_ 2 M^- 2 between H_ 0 ∥ c and H_ 0 c indicates that this enhancement is caused by electron spin correlations between the inner and the outer CuO_ 2 layers. These results provide the answer to the long-standing controversy regarding <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>T</b> dependences of (T_ 1 T) ^- 1 and T_ 2 G^- 2 in the pseudogap regime of bi- and trilayer systems.

40|$|DNA {{polymerase}} {{activity is}} essential for replication, recombination, repair, and mutagenesis. All DNA polymerases studied so far from any biological source synthesize DNA by the Watson-Crick base-pairing rule, incorporating A, G, C, and <b>T</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>the</b> templates <b>T,</b> C, G, and A, respectively. Non-Watson-Crick base pairs would lead to mutations. In this report, we describe the ninth human DNA polymerase, Polι, encoded by the RAD 30 B gene. We show that human Polι violates the Watson-Crick base-pairing rule <b>opposite</b> template <b>T.</b> During base selection, human Polι preferred T-G base pairing, leading to G incorporation <b>opposite</b> template <b>T.</b> <b>The</b> resulting T-G base pair was less efficiently extended by human Polι compared to the Watson-Crick base pairs.

Furthermore, kinetic analyses show that human Polι copies template C with extraordinarily low fidelity, misincorporating T, A, and C with unprecedented frequencies of 1 / 9, 1 / 10, and 1 / 11, respectively. Human Polι incorporated one nucleotide opposite a template abasic site more efficiently than <b>opposite</b> a template <b>T,</b> suggesting a role for human Polι in DNA lesion bypass.

For the OH + CH 4 reaction, at low temperatures, T = 200 K, where the quantum tunnelling effect is more important, RPMD overestimates the experimental rate constants due to problems associated with PES- 2014 in the deep tunnelling regime and to the known overestimation of this method in asymmetric reactions, while VTST/MT presents a better agreement, differences about 10 %, due to compensation of several factors, inaccuracy of PES- 2014 and ignoring anharmonicity. In <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> extreme, <b>T</b> = 1000 K, recrossing effects play the main role, {{and the difference between}} both methods is now smaller, by a factor of 1. 5. Given that RPMD results are exact in the high-temperature limit, the discrepancy is due to the approaches used in the VTST/MT method, such as ignoring the anharmonicity of the lowest vibrational frequencies along the reaction path which leads to an incorrect location of the dividing surface between reactants and products. The analysis of several kinetic isotope effects, OH + CD 4, OD + CH 4, and OH + 12 CH 4 / 13 CH 4, sheds light on these problems and confirms the previous conclusions.

A new massive gauge boson with flavor dependent couplings can mix with the Z and cause shifts in the Z couplings to the various flavors. In particular a new boson coupling to the third family 1 but not the light families can account [1] for the anomalously large values of Ŵ b and αs measured at LEP. Variations on this theme have recently been considered for other possible anomalies as well [2].

40|$|Notch {{signalling}} is {{a critical}} mediator of T cell development. However, while this signalling pathway is essential, it {{is not sufficient to}} induce T cell fate into multipotent hematopoietic precursor cells. Although Notch signalling events are crucial at all of the initial stages of T-lineage differentiation, T cell development also depends on other regulatory factors that are required at precise levels in order to preserve the well-balanced network that drives this process. Miss-expression of one of the factors profoundly perturbs this balance and results in alternative lineage cell fate. In this process, Notch plays an essential role as a gate-keeper of T-lineage fidelity by either enforcing the T cell fate or by inducing cell death if alternative lineages are induced in its presence. Notch also plays a critical role in the further lineage choices that occur within the T cell lineage. Importantly however, this seems to be different between mouse and human. While in the mouse it is clear that TCR-alphabeta T cells are much more dependent on Notch signalling compared to TCR-gammadelta T cells, the requirement for Notch signalling during human T cell development seems to be <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> for both <b>T</b> cell lineages.

40|$|Human DNA {{polymerase}} ι (Polι) is {{a member}} of the Y family of DNA polymerases involved in translesion DNA synthesis. Polι is highly unusual in that it possesses a high fidelity on template A, but has an unprecedented low fidelity on template T, preferring to misincorporate a G instead of an A. To understand the mechanisms of nucleotide incorporation opposite different template bases by Polι, we have carried out pre-steady-state kinetic analyses of nucleotide incorporation opposite templates A and T. These analyses have revealed that <b>opposite</b> template A, <b>the</b> correct nucleotide is preferred because it is bound tighter and is incorporated faster than <b>the</b> incorrect nucleotides. <b>Opposite</b> template <b>T,</b> however, <b>the</b> correct and incorrect nucleotides are incorporated at very similar rates, and interestingly, the greater efficiency of G misincorporation relative to A incorporation <b>opposite</b> <b>T</b> arises predominantly from the tighter binding of G. Based on these results, we propose that the incipient base pair is accommodated differently in the active site of Polι dependent upon the template base and that when T is the templating base, Polι accommodates the wobble base pair better than the Watson-Crick base pair...|$|R
