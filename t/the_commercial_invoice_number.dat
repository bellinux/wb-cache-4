50|$|In some countries, customs may {{accept a}} pro forma invoice (generated by the {{importer}} {{and not the}} exporter) if <b>the</b> required <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> is not {{available at the time}} when filing entry documents at the port of entry to get goods released from customs. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, for example, uses pro forma invoices to assess duty and examine goods, but the importer on record is required to post a bond and produce a <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> within 120 days from the date of entry. If <b>the</b> required <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> is needed for statistical purposes, the importer has to produce <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> within 50 days from the date Customs releases the goods to the importer.|$|R
50|$|Information {{typically}} {{reviewed by}} {{a freight forwarder}} includes <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice,</b> shipper's export declaration, bill of lading and other documents required by the carrier or country of export, import, and/or transshipment. Much of this information is now processed in a paperless environment.|$|R
50|$|A sales quote is {{prepared}} {{in the form}} of a pro forma invoice which is different from a <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice.</b> It is used to create a sale and is sent in advance of <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice.</b> <b>The</b> content of a pro forma invoice is almost identical to a <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> and is usually considered a binding agreement although the price may change in advance of the final sale.|$|R
50|$|A {{pro forma}} invoice {{is the same}} as a <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> which, when used in {{international}} trade, represents the details of an international sale to customs authorities. A pro forma invoice is presented in the place of a <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> when there is no sale between the sender and the importer (for example, {{in the case of an}} RMA for replacement goods), or if the terms of the sale between the seller and the buyer are such that a <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> is not yet available at the time of the international shipment. A pro forma invoice is required to state the same facts that <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> would and <b>the</b> content is prescribed by the governments who are a party to the transaction.|$|R
40|$|Classification is an {{important}} problem in image document processing and is often a preliminary step towards recognition, understanding, and information extraction. In this paper, the problem is formulated {{in the framework of}} concept learning and each category corresponds to the set of image documents with similar physical structure. We propose a solution based on two algorithmic ideas. First, we obtain a structured representation of images based on labeled XY-trees (this representation informs the learner about important relationships between image sub-constituents). Second, we propose a probabilistic architecture that extends hidden Markov models for learning probability distributions defined on spaces of labeled trees. Finally, a successful application of this method to <b>the</b> categorization of <b>commercial</b> <b>invoices</b> is presented...|$|R
40|$|Sikorsky is {{currently}} negotiating the SDTA {{proposal for the}} CH- 53 K helicopter. Due to the Truth In Negotiations Act (TINA), when submitting a proposal to the government all suppliers with a total award greater than $ 700, 000 need to have supporting documentation (material substantiation) showing that pricing is fair and reasonable. This can be accomplished through competition, a cost-price analysis (CPA), or commerciality. Each entity involved in the proposal prefers a different substantiation method: the government prefers CPA or competition, the suppliers prefer commerciality, and Sikorsky prefers competition. Because the government and suppliers have opposing views on commerciality, the government has increased the oversight and complexity of <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> process. Previously, a proposal's commerciality claims required only a commerciality claim form and an invoice showing that the part had been sold to a commercial entity, but did not require the supplier to provide <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> price. For <b>the</b> SDTA proposal, an approved commerciality claim required a commerciality form, non-redacted invoices showing pricing information and the customer to which the part was sold, an escalated price analysis to support price reasonableness, a detailed list of modifications to <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> part, an estimated cost of the modifications, and final commercial end user information. <b>The</b> <b>commercial</b> process involved roughly 90 Sikorsky employees and required roughly 11 months to fulfill all of <b>the</b> government's SDTA <b>commercial</b> requirements. As a comparison, CPA substantiation was completed 4 months prior to commerciality. Reasons for the long cycle time include labor time, a lengthy paper internal approval process including process downtime, lost or misprocessed documents, and insufficient employee training. To combat these inefficiencies, a formalized commercial substantiation process that uses an electronic workspace to provide process control is proposed in this thesis. <b>The</b> formalized <b>commercial</b> substantiation process decreases the required labor hours by an estimated 43 %, decreases the internal approval cycle time by 74 %, and provides secure document management. These improvements not only benefit the company internally, but also provide external benefits like an increase in government satisfaction which will help Sikorsky attain additional government contracts. by Carolyn Marie Freeman.

40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Master of Business Administration, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 46). A freight forwarder, forwarder, or forwarding agent is a person or company that organizes shipments for individuals or corporations to get goods from the manufacturer or producer to a market, customer or final point of distribution. Forwarders contract with a carrier to move the goods. A forwarder does not move the goods but acts as an expert in supply chain management. A forwarder contracts with carriers to move cargo ranging from raw agricultural products to manufactured goods. Information typically reviewed by a freight forwarder includes <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice,</b> shipper's export declaration, bill of lading and other documents required by the carrier or country of export, import, and/or transhipment. Nowadays, the freight forwarding is not limited within the same geographical limit of any country. Due to globalization and free market economy, this industry is facing severe competition. As the competition among companies are rapidly increasing, many companies are trying to provide distinct services in terms of air freight forwarding, sea freight forwarding, customs brokerage, consolidation, logistics management, Off-Dock services, household removal, transportation and so on. Novo Cargo is totally committed to provide a total transportation services to their clients irrespective {{of the size of}} consignment. They plan, coordinate, supervise, document and monitor the entire movement system of consignment. As Freight forwarding and logistics service sector is gradually developing to be a huge service sector so I am glad {{to have an opportunity to}} work in Novo cargo Services Ltd. to explore their activities and build up an analytical insight regarding their services. As important freight forwarding and logistics services, Off-Dock offers entire item-wise package of service activities for handling the temporary empty/laden container storage, loading/unloading general export/import goods, and containers under custom clearance. It is an equivalent of a seaport located in the hinterland. Novo Cargo uses Esack depot as a part of Off-Dock facilities which is located adjacent to Chittagong port. Novo Cargo’s dynamic approach to household removal business is well supported by the concerned authorities in Bangladesh. The objective of the company is to deliver reliable, cost effective transportation and management of clients’ goods. Novo Cargo also offers other comprehensive services like air and sea freight, surface services, customs brokerages, cargo management, chartering, consolidation, warehousing and distribution, inland transportation and so on.
