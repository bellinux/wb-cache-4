40|$|Neuroblastoma is {{the most}} {{commonly}} diagnosed childhood cancer and accounts for about 15 % of all pediatric malignancies deaths. Thus far, the treatment options of neuroblastoma is limited with only a 30 - 40 % long term survival rate in high-risk patients. In this thesis, we describe the isolation and propagation of neuroblastoma organoids called tumour initiating cells (TICs). We show that these cells recapitulate the genotype and phenotype of the primary tumours from which they are derived from. These organoid systems might thus improve in vitro pre-clinical drug testing studies in neuroblastoma. The genomic landscape of neuroblastoma constitutes of whole chromosome gains and losses as well as deletions and amplification of specific regions of the chromosomes. MYCN amplification, 17 q gain, 1 p 36 and 11 q losses are strong prognostic indicators of poor patient outcome. Amplification of chromosome 7 q 36 which harbours EZH 2 has been observed in neuroblastoma. We carried out <b>the</b> <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>evaluation</b> of EZH 2 histone methyltransferase-specific inhibitors in neuroblastoma. We show that EZH 2 is important in neuroblastoma cell survival independent of its histone methyltransferase function. Aside from the genomic events observed in neuroblastoma, several oncogenes and tumour suppressors are frequently deregulated in neuroblastoma. The B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (BCL 2) is frequently upregulated in neuroblastoma. We described <b>the</b> <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the BCL 2 -specific inhibitor venetoclax in neuroblastoma. We show that response to venetoclax is strongly correlated to BCL 2 protein and mRNA levels. Resistance to venetoclax could be overcome by the combined inhibition of BCL 2 and MCL 1 as well as p 53 -mediated activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway...|$|E

It has become evident that very subtle alterations in FVIII can have dramatic effects on its antigenicity and immunogenicity and it is suggested that an analysis of FVIII preparations, using reagents such as mouse monoclonal antibodies, should be carried out as a pre-clinical evaluation. It is also thought that any haemophiliac patient is at risk of developing anti-FVIII antibodies, even though he had been considered as tolerant to the infusion of FVIII. The diversity of FVIII concentrates now available on the market has multiplied the chances of encountering a product that would give an immune response in some patients and this further stresses the need for a careful check of FVIII concentrates. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} drozitumab, a human monoclonal agonistic antibody directed against death receptor 5 (DR 5), as a new therapeutic avenue for the targeted treatment of bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. The antitumour activity of drozitumab as a monotherapy or in combination with Nutlin- 3 a was evaluated in a panel of sarcoma cell lines in vitro and human sarcoma patient samples ex vivo. Knockdown experiments were used to investigate {{the central role of}} p 53 as a regulator of drozitumab cytotoxicity. Pre-activation of the p 53 pathway through Nutlin- 3 a upregulated DR 5, subsequently sensitising sarcoma cell lines and human sarcoma specimens to the pro-apoptotic effects of drozitumab. Silencing of p 53 strongly decreased DR 5 mRNA expression resulting in abrogation of drozitumab-induced apoptosis.

40|$|Patients with relapsed/refractory T-cell acute {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) have a dismal prognosis. Prior {{to the development}} of novel purine analogs, salvage chemotherapy was of limited efficacy. Nelarabine, and more recently, clofarabine and forodesine have demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in relapsed/refractory T-ALL and T-LBL. As a single agent, nelarabine induces response rates in between 33 % to 50 % of adult or pediatric patients with T-ALL/T-LBL, respectively. On the other hand, limited activity was observed in mature T-cell neoplasms. Significant neurotoxicity has been the major obstacle for the further clinical development of nelarabine.

Human ovarian carcinoma cells stably expressing the firefly luciferase gene (SKOV 3 Luc) were injected i. p. into SCID mice. Tumour growth was evaluated during sustained or intermittent courses of i. p. treatment with paclitaxel (PTX). In vitro bioluminescence strongly correlated with cell survival and cytotoxicity. Bioluminescent imaging detected tumours before their macroscopic appearance and strongly correlated with tumour weight and survival. As compared with intermittent therapy with Taxol®, sustained PTXePC therapy resulted in significant reduction of tumour proliferation, weight and BLI signal intensity, enhanced apoptosis and increased survival times.

40|$|Radiotherapy is {{commonly}} used {{in the treatment of}} head and neck cancer. For early stage tumours, conventional radiotherapy techniques have a high cure rate and low levels of long-term complications. Patients with more advanced cancers have much lower cure rates and high levels of treatment-related complications. Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is a new form of focussed radiation therapy. It has been used to reduce the radiation dose to normal tissue structures and increase the dose delivered to tumour bearing tissues. This potentially allows reduced side effects and increased tumour control compared to conventional radiotherapy. The rationale of this thesis was to test whether these twin goals could be achieved in head and neck cancer patients. The first part of the thesis describes improvements in patient immobilisation, optimisation of techniques for neck irradiation, and evaluation of the technique in a busy radiotherapy department. It includes <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>evaluation</b> of IMRT for different tumour sites, the development of quality assurance programs and the conduct of a national randomised controlled trial of parotid-sparing IMRT. This trial concluded that IMRT significantly reduced patient-reported xerostomia, allowed recovery of saliva production and improved quality of life. The second part of <b>the</b> thesis describes <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>evaluation</b> of techniques to escalate radiation dose in patients with larynx and hypopharynx tumours. A phase I/II clinical trial showed that higher doses of radiation can be delivered at the expense of an increase in acute radiation toxicity but without a measurable increase in late radiation side effects.

Exploring this novel approach unlocks the possibility to mimic the tumor microenvironment in vitro, through the establishment of cancer-stroma synergistic interactions. Notably, these organotypic models offer a perfect platform for <b>the</b> development and <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>evaluation</b> of candidate nanocarriers loaded with anti-tumoral drugs in a high throughput screening mode, with lower costs and absence of ethical issues. However, this evaluation was until now limited to co-culture systems established with precise cell ratios, not addressing the natural cell heterogeneity commonly found in different tumors. Therefore, herein the multifunctional nanocarriers efficiency was characterized in various fibroblast-MCF- 7 co-culture systems containing different cell ratios, in order to unravel key design parameters that influence nanocarrier performance and the therapeutic outcome. The successful establishment of the co-culture models was confirmed by the tissue-like distribution of the different cells in culture. Nanoparticles incubation in the various co-culture systems reveals that these nanocarriers possess targeting specificity for cancer cells, indicating their suitability for being used in this illness therapy. Additionally, by using different co-culture ratios, different nanoparticle uptake profiles were obtained. These findings are of crucial importance for the future design and optimization of new drug delivery systems, since their real targeting capacity must be addressed in heterogenous cell populations, such as those found in tumors.

40|$|Abstract Background Multiple myeloma (MM) is a fatal {{malignancy}} ranking {{second in}} prevalence among hematological tumors. Continuous efforts {{are being made}} to develop innovative and more effective treatments. The preclinical evaluation of new therapies relies {{on the use of}} murine models of the disease. Methods Here we describe a new MM animal model in NOD-Rag 1 null IL 2 rgnull (NRG) mice that supports the engraftment of cell lines and primary MM cells that can be tracked with the tumor antigen, AKAP- 4. Results Human MM cell lines, U 266 and H 929, and primary MM cells were successfully engrafted in NRG mice after intravenous administration, and were found in the bone marrow, blood and spleen of tumor-challenged animals. The AKAP- 4 expression pattern was similar to that of known MM markers, such as paraproteins, CD 38 and CD 45. Conclusions We developed {{for the first time a}} murine model allowing for the growth of both MM cell lines and primary cells in multifocal sites, thus mimicking the disease seen in patients. Additionally, we validated the use of AKAP- 4 antigen to track tumor growth in vivo and to specifically identify MM cells in mouse tissues.

40|$|In <b>the</b> total <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>evaluation</b> of new {{heart valve}} substitutes, {{there is an}} {{absolute}} need for chronic experimental valve testing in different animal models. Also fundamental research towards mechanisms of calcification, tissue degeneration and valve thrombosis requires standardized and well-controlled animal models. Possible clinical use of a new experimental valve type and/or future developments and improvements in prosthetic heart valves, all depend on such research activities. Our recent studies concerning prosthetic heart valves resulted in following conclusions. 1. Photo-oxidation, a new tissue treatment, seems to have many possible advantages over currently existing valve fixation techniques (glutaraldehyde-fixation). The stentless porcine photo-fixed valve shows, in contrast to standard stentless valves, no aortic wall mineralization together with a good preservation of cuspal function. 2. For clinical right-sided valve implantations, {{the presence of a}} stent, together with the fixation pressure of the valve, can have its influence on the long-term behaviour of the valves in this low-pressure environment. Both stented valves, as valves fixed under pressure, seem to suffer more from fibrous tissue overgrowth 3. Mechanical stress {{is an important factor in}} the degeneration and calcification of biological valve tissue, mainly when an unfavourable stress pattern is present. Not all currently used animal models are equally reliable for valve testing and evaluation. 4. Implantation of aortic wall samples in the jugular vein of juvenile sheep is a simple, reliable and cost-effective model of aortic wall calcification. Calcification of glutaraldehyde-fixed aortic wall tissue is initiated at the level of cellular remnants, with little or no contribution from elastic fibers. Acellularization can avoid this cell-mediated calcification, but an additional treatment will be necessary to avoid the inflammation leading to elastolysis and consequent calcification of elastic fibers. 5. Mechanical valve implantation in pulmonary position delivers a reliable and reproducible test of mechanical valve thrombosis. The model allows us to compare the thrombogenic potential of different mechanical valve types, while it can also serve as a test for new therapeutic or diagnostic tools for mechanical valve thrombosis. status: publishe...|$|R

Assessment of the efficacy of RDN modalities primarily focuses on the determination of the depth of penetration of treatment-related injury (e. g., necrosis) of the periarterial tissues and its relationship (i. e., location and distance) and the effect on the associated renal nerves and the correlation thereof with proxy biomarkers including renal norepinephrine concentrations and nerve-specific immunohistochemical stains (e. g., tyrosine hydroxylase). The safety evaluation of RDN technologies involves assessing for adverse effects on tissues local to the site of treatment (i. e., on the arterial wall) as well as tissues at a distance (e. g., soft tissue, veins, arterial branches, skeletal muscle, adrenal gland, ureters).

Results A murine colon cancer cell line stably transfected with the luciferase gene (MC 38 Luc 1) retains tumorigenicity in immunocompetent C 57 BL/ 6 animals. Intrahepatic inoculation of MC 38 Luc 1 causes progressive liver infiltration that can be monitored by BLI. Compared with ultrasonography (US), BLI is more sensitive, but accurate estimation of tumor mass is impaired in advanced stages. We applied BLI to evaluate the efficacy of an immunogene therapy approach based on the liver-specific expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin- 12 (IL- 12). Individualized quantification of light emission was able to determine the extent and duration of antitumor responses and to predict long-term disease-free survival. Conclusion We show that BLI is a rapid, convenient and safe technique for the individual monitorization of tumor progression in the liver.

40|$|Phosphoinositide- 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) is {{an enzyme}} group, known to {{regulate}} key survival pathways in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). It generates phosphatidylinositol- 3, 4, 5 -triphosphate, {{which provides a}} membrane docking site for protein kinaseB activation. PI 3 K catalytic p 110 subunits are divided into 4 isoforms; α,β,δ and γ. The PI 3 Kδ isoform is always expressed in AML cells, whereas the frequency of PI 3 Kγ expression is highly variable. The functions of these individual catalytic enzymes have not been fully resolved in AML, therefore using the PI 3 K p 110 δ and p 110 γ-targeted inhibitor IPI- 145 (duvelisib) and specific p 110 δ and p 110 γ shRNA, we analysed the role of these two p 110 subunits in human AML blast survival. The results show that PI 3 Kδ and PI 3 Kγ inhibition with IPI- 145 has anti-proliferative activity in primary AML cells by inhibiting the activity of AKT and MAPK. Pre-treatment of AML cells with IPI- 145 inhibits both adhesion and migration of AML blasts to bone marrow stromal cells. Using shRNA targeted to the individual isoforms we demonstrated that p 110 δ-knockdown had a more significant anti-proliferative effect on AML cells, whereas targeting p 110 γ-knockdown significantly inhibited AML migration.

40|$|Rat model/Post-radiation sarcoma/MicroPET. Radiotherapy is an {{integral}} part of overall cancer therapy. One of the most serious adverse effects of irradiation concern, for long-term survivors, the development of post-radiation sarcoma (PRS) in healthy tissues located within the irradiated area. PRS have bad prognosis and are often detected at a late stage. Therefore, it is obvious that the early detection PRS is a key-point and the development of preclinical mod-els is worthy to evaluate innovative diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The aim of this study was to develop a spontaneous murin model of PRS and to evaluate the potency of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for early detection. Fifteen Wistars rats were irradiated unilateraly on the hindlimb with a single dose of 30 Gy. Sequential analysis was based on observational staging recordings, Computerized Tomography (CT) scanning and PET. Tumors were removed and, histopathological and immunochemistry analyses were performed. Among the irradiated rats, 12 sarcomas (80 %) were detected. All tumors occurred naturallty within the irradiated hindlimb and were highly aggressive since most tumors (75 %) were successfully trans-planted and maintained by serial transplantation into nude mice. Upon serial staging recordings, using PET, was found to enable the detection of PRS earlier after irradiation than with the other methods (i. e. 11. 9 ± 1. 8 vs 12. 9 ± 2. 6 months).

40|$|Glioblastoma (GBM) is {{a highly}} {{aggressive}} and fatal brain cancer {{that is associated with}} a number of diagnostic, therapeutic, and treatment monitoring challenges. At the time of writing, inhibition of a protein called poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 (PARP- 1) in combination with chemotherapy was being investigated as a novel approach for the treatment of these tumours. However, human studies have encountered toxicity problems due to sub-optimal PARP- 1 inhibitor and chemotherapeutic dosing regiments. Nuclear imaging of PARP- 1 could help to address these issues and provide additional insight into potential PARP- 1 inhibitor resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, nuclear imaging of the translocator protein (TSPO) could be used to improve GBM diagnosis, pre-surgical planning, and treatment monitoring as TSPO is overexpressed by GBM lesions in good contrast to surrounding brain tissue. To date, relatively few nuclear imaging radiotracers have been discovered for PARP- 1. On the other hand, numerous tracers exist for TSPO many of which have been investigated in humans. However, these TSPO radiotracers suffer from either poor pharmacokinetic properties or high sensitivity to human TSPO polymorphism that can affect their binding to TSPO. Bearing in mind the above and the high attrition rates associated with advancement of radiotracers to the clinic, {{there is a need for}} novel radiotracers that can be used to image PARP- 1 and TSPO. This thesis reports <b>the</b> <b>pre-clinical</b> discovery programme that led to the identification of two potent PARP- 1 inhibitors, 4 and 17, that were successfully radiolabelled to generate the potential SPECT and PET imaging agents [123 I]- 4 and [18 F]- 17 respectively. Evaluation of these radiotracers in mice bearing subcutaneous human GBM xenografts using ex vivo biodistribution techniques revealed that the agents were retained in tumour tissue due to specific PARP- 1 binding. This thesis also describes <b>the</b> <b>pre-clinical</b> in vivo <b>evaluation</b> of [18 F]-AB 5186, which is a novel radiotracer discovered previously within the research group with potential for PET imaging of TSPO. Using ex vivo autoradiography and PET imaging the agent was revealed to accumulate in intracranial human GBM tumour xenografts in good contrast to surrounding brain tissue, which was due to specific binding to TSPO. The in vivo data for all three radiolabelled compounds warrants further pre-clinical investigations with potential for clinical advancement in mind...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Communication, Curriculum, and Culture (C 3) {{instrument}} is a well-established survey {{for measuring the}} professional learning climate or hidden curriculum in the clinical years of medical school. However, few instruments exist for assessing professionalism in <b>the</b> <b>pre-clinical</b> years. We adapted the C 3 instrument and assessed its utility during <b>the</b> <b>pre-clinical</b> years at two U. S. medical schools. METHODS: <b>The</b> ten-item <b>Pre-Clinical</b> C 3 survey was adapted from the C 3 instrument. Surveys were administered {{at the conclusion of}} the first and second years of medical school using a repeated cross-sectional design. Factor analysis was performed and Cronbach's alphas were calculated for emerging dimensions. RESULTS: The authors collected 458 and 564 surveys at two medical schools during AY 06 - 07 and AY 07 - 09 years, respectively. Factor analysis of the survey data revealed nine items in three dimensions: "Patients as Objects", "Talking Respectfully of Colleagues", and "Patient-Centered Behaviors". Reliability measures (Cronbach's alpha) for <b>the</b> <b>Pre-Clinical</b> C 3 survey data were similar to those of the C 3 survey for comparable dimensions for each school. Gender analysis revealed significant differences in all three dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> <b>Pre-Clinical</b> C 3 instrument's performance was similar to the C 3 instrument in measuring dimensions of professionalism. As medical education moves toward earlier and more frequent clinical and inter-professional educational experiences, <b>the</b> <b>Pre-Clinical</b> C 3 instrument may be especially useful in evaluating the impact of curricular revisions...|$|R
40|$|Bone {{morphology}} {{and density}} changes are commonly observed following joint replacement, and {{may contribute to}} the risks of implant loosening and periprosthetic fracture, and reduce the available bone stock for revision surgery. This study was presented in the “Bone and Cartilage Mechanobiology across the scales” WCCM symposium to review the development of remodelling prediction methods and to demonstrate simulation of adaptive bone remodelling around hip replacement femoral components, incorporating intrinsic (prosthesis) and extrinsic (activity and loading) factors. An iterative bone remodelling process was applied to finite element models of a femur implanted with a cementless THR (total hip replacement) and a hip resurfacing implant. Previously developed for a cemented THR implant, this modified process enabled the influence of pre- to postoperative changes in patient activity and joint loading to be evaluated. A control algorithm used identical pre- and postoperative conditions, and the predicted extents and temporal trends of remodelling were measured by generating virtual x-rays and DXA scans. The modified process improved qualitative and quantitative remodelling predictions for both the cementless THR and resurfacing implants, but demonstrated the sensitivity to DXA scan region definition and appropriate implant-bone position and sizing. Predicted remodelling in the intact femur in response to changed activity and loading demonstrated that in this simplified model, although the influence of the extrinsic effects were important, the mechanics of implantation were dominant. This study supports the application of predictive bone remodelling as one element in the range of physical and computational studies, which should be conducted in <b>the</b> <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>evaluation</b> of new prostheses...|$|E
40|$|Homeostasis of {{vascular}} barriers {{depends upon}} sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) signaling via the S 1 P 1 receptor. Accordingly, S 1 P 1 competitive antagonism {{is known to}} reduce vascular barrier integrity with still unclear pathophysiological consequences. This was explored {{in the present study}} using NIBR- 0213, a potent and selective S 1 P 1 competitive antagonist. NIBR- 0213 was tolerated at the efficacious oral dose of 30 mg/kg BID in the rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AiA) model, with no sign of labored breathing. However, it induced dose-dependent acute vascular pulmonary leakage and pleural effusion that fully resolved within 3 - 4 days, as evidenced by MRI monitoring. At the supra-maximal oral dose of 300 mg/kg QD, NIBR- 0213 impaired lung function (with increased breathing rate and reduced tidal volume) within the first 24 hrs. Two weeks of NIBR- 0213 oral dosing at 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg QD induced moderate pulmonary changes, characterized by alveolar wall thickening, macrophage accumulation, fibrosis, micro-hemorrhage, edema and necrosis. In addition to this picture of chronic inflammation, perivascular edema and myofiber degeneration observed in the heart were also indicative of vascular leakage and its consequences. Overall, these observations suggest that, in the rat, the lung is the main target organ for the S 1 P 1 competitive antagonism-induced acute vascular leakage, which appears first as transient and asymptomatic but could lead, upon chronic dosing, to lung remodeling with functional impairments. Hence, this not only raises the question of organ specificity in the homeostasis of vascular barriers, but also provides insight into <b>the</b> <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>evaluation</b> of a potential safety window for S 1 P 1 competitive antagonists as drug candidates...|$|E
40|$|Methoxy {{isobutyl}} isonitrile labelled with technetium- 99 m (99 mTc) radionuclide can be {{used for}} the evaluation of acute myocardial infarction. The 99 mTc-MIBI radiopharmaceutical is available in the lyophilized-kit, which is separately packed with its radionuclide. Recently, in CNTMR-BATAN Bandung, 99 mTc-MIBI radiopharmaceutical was prepared using MIBI ligand synthesized in 1996 as lyophilized-kits having the radiochemical purity less than 90 % and not accumulated in the myocardium. It could be caused by several factors, among others were technical preparation of lyophilized dry-kit and the quality of MIBI; therefore the reevaluation of the ligand for the quality improvement was needed. Firstly, MIBI ligand was recristallized. It was found that MIBI as [Cu(MIBI) 4]BF 4 salt was a glassy solid with the melting point of 98 - 99 oC. The infra red analysis showed the presence of spectra vibration at 1085, 1180 cm- 1 and 2180, 2220 cm- 1 for –OCH 3 and N≡C groups, respectively. The preparation of 99 mTc-MIBI was performed by adding 99 mTc radionuclide into new MIBI liquid-kit, then boiled in water bath for minimum period of 10 minutes. The radiochemical purity of 99 mTc-MIBI was analysed by thin layer chromatographic method using absolute ethanol as a mobile phase. <b>The</b> <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>evaluation</b> was observed in Wistar rat and clinical studies were performed in volunter using gamma camera. It is revealed that the radiochemical purity of more than 90 % i. e. 96. 83 ± 1. 43 % was still stable until 24 hours storage at room temperature. The stability studies of 99 mTc-MIBI in human blood plasma showed that in 6 hours, the radiochemical purity was decreased to 90. 89 ± 2. 90 %. Clinical application of 99 mTc-MIBI with tomography techniques using gamma camera showed the distinct accumulation of radioactivity in the heart...|$|E
