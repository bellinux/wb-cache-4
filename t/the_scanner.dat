5|$|As Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) {{attempts}} {{to negotiate with}} the Aldeans, they briefly allow Dr. Crusher to reunite with her son on the planet. Wesley hints about the Custodian to her, while she secretly passes him a tricorder to scan the Aldeans. After Picard fails to get the Aldeans to agree to the children's return, they fire an energy weapon that sends the Enterprise three days away from Aldea at maximum warp. The Aldeans warn that they can send the Enterprise an impossibly far distance if they refuse to cooperate. During the return trip, Dr. Crusher reviews <b>the</b> <b>scanner</b> results and finds the Aldeans are suffering from radiation poisoning, which has harmed their reproductive capabilities but can be reversed if the source is discovered. On arrival back at the planet, Picard orders the crew {{to try to find a}} way through the planet's shield while he restarts negotiations.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{component}} {{sound of a}} Hammond organ comes from a tonewheel. Each one rotates {{in front of an}} electromagnetic pickup. The variation in the magnetic field induces a small alternating current at a particular frequency, which represents a signal similar to a sine wave. When a key is pressed on the organ, it completes a circuit of nine electrical switches, which are linked to the drawbars. The position of the drawbars, combined with the switches selected by the key pressed, determines which tonewheels are allowed to sound. Every tonewheel is connected to a synchronous motor via a system of gears, which ensures that each note remains at a constant relative pitch to every other. The combined signal from all depressed keys and pedals is fed through to the vibrato system, which is driven by a metal scanner. As <b>the</b> <b>scanner</b> rotates around a set of pickups, it changes the pitch of the overall sound slightly. From here, the sound is sent to the main amplifier, and on to the audio speakers.|$|E

5|$|This {{technology}} {{is widely used}} in confirming venous pathology diagnoses. The imaging capability needed, was made possible with the developments of Doppler and color Doppler. Doppler measurements using Doppler effect can show {{the direction of the}} blood flow and its relative velocity and color Doppler is the provision of color to help interpret the image, showing for example, the blood flow towards the probe in one color and that flowing away another. Whilst the equipment itself is costly, the procedure is not. Apart from <b>the</b> <b>scanner,</b> different probes are required according to the depth to be studied. A gel is used with the probe to make a good acoustic impedance contact. The training and expertise of the examiner is important because of the many technical complications that can present. Venous anatomy for example, is not constant, for example a patient's vein layout of the right limb is not identical to that of the left limb.|$|E
5|$|Yellow Fever and How to Cure It was {{a three-part}} story by Robert Holmes {{that would have}} taken place in Singapore and {{featured}} the Autons as the monsters, with both the Rani and the Master appearing, the Brigadier would have also returned. The first episode was commissioned on 26 October 1984, before being put on hold. The entire story was subsequently commissioned on 6 February 1985, only {{a couple of weeks before}} news of the planned hiatus broke. Nathan-Turner hoped to have Graeme Harper direct the adventure. After the news of the hiatus, Holmes was asked by the production team to continue with the story but as six 25 minute episodes, this version seeing the removal of the Master from the plot. Holmes reportedly only completed a story outline before the planned Season 23 was completely cancelled. The basic premise had the Master and the Rani operating under the guise of a travelling street theatre, the story would open with Peri seeing the Statue of Liberty on <b>the</b> <b>scanner</b> screen, and she would think she was back in America, only to find they were in a massive cultural garden with many miniature landmarks on display.|$|E

Its purpose was to keep members informed on union actions and it was known for advertising union businesses. A special feature of the newspaper included the KCLC’s regular list of businesses to boycott. <b>The</b> <b>Scanner</b> was heavily involved in politics and often endorsed candidates from the Democratic Party.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>scanner</b> {{platform}} {{generates a}} 3nbsp&D {{volume of the}} subject's head every TR. This consists of an array of voxel intensity values, one value per voxel in the scan.

25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>scanner</b> {{was turned}} on it rotated the dish {{clockwise}} through a complete circle 17 times a second.

40|$|Qualification {{testing of}} Combustion Engineering's AMDATA Intraspect/ 98 Data Acquisition and Imaging System {{that applies to}} the {{redesigned}} solid rocket motor field joint capture feature case-to-insulation bondline inspection was performed. Testing was performed at M- 111, the Thiokol Corp. Inert Parts Preparation Building. The purpose of the inspection was to verify {{the integrity of the}} capture feature area case-to-insulation bondline. <b>The</b> capture feature <b>scanner</b> was calibrated over an intentional 1. 0 to 1. 0 in. case-to-insulation unbond. <b>The</b> capture feature <b>scanner</b> was then used to scan 60 deg of a capture feature field joint. Calibration of <b>the</b> capture feature <b>scanner</b> was then rechecked over the intentional unbond to ensure that the calibration settings did not change during the case scan. This procedure was successfully performed five times to qualify the unbond detection capability of <b>the</b> capture feature <b>scanner.</b> <b>The</b> capture feature <b>scanner</b> qualified in this test contains many points of mechanical instability that can affect the overall ultrasonic signal response. A new generation <b>scanner,</b> designated <b>the</b> sigma <b>scanner,</b> should be implemented to replace <b>the</b> current configuration <b>scanner.</b> <b>The</b> sigma <b>scanner</b> eliminates <b>the</b> unstable connection points of <b>the</b> current <b>scanner</b> and has additional inspection capabilities...|$|R

25|$|The use of raw {{networking}} {{has several}} advantages, giving <b>the</b> <b>scanner</b> {{full control of}} the packets sent and the timeout for responses, and allowing detailed reporting of the responses. There is debate over which scan is less intrusive on the target host. SYN scan has the advantage that the individual services never actually receive a connection. However, the RST during the handshake can cause problems for some network stacks, in particular simple devices like printers. There are no conclusive arguments either way.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{altitude}} of the beacon was known, on the ground, the angular display was not needed. Instead, a switch was flipped {{by a small}} cam on <b>the</b> <b>scanner</b> as it passed the 12 and 6 o'clock positions in its rotation pattern, causing the receiver output to be inverted. The angular scanning was turned off and the time base re-positioned {{at the bottom of}} the screen. Received signals caused the time base to move to the left or right depending on where the dish was pointed at the time the signal was received.|$|E
25|$|The {{radar beam}} has a width of about 10 degrees, and pulses 2.5 degrees, so a target will {{not produce a}} single blip, {{but a number of}} them. For targets located far from the centreline, the radar would produce 4 or 5 {{individual}} blips as <b>the</b> <b>scanner</b> rotated, causing a short arc about 10 degrees wide to show on the display. A somewhat more complex interaction occurs as the target aircraft approaches the centre of the radar scan. Any target within ten degrees of the centreline will always have some radar energy falling on it no matter where the dish is pointed; a target five degrees {{to the right of the}} aircraft would still be reflecting the outer edge of the broadcast even when <b>the</b> <b>scanner</b> is pointed five degrees to the left. In this case the target will create blips throughout the entire rotation, drawing a complete ring on the display instead of a short arc. Because the antenna is more sensitive in the middle than the edges, the ring on the display will vary in brightness as the dish scans, reaching its maximum when the dish is aimed at the target, and a minimum, or disappearing entirely, when it is pointed the other direction. A target that is dead ahead will produce a complete uninterrupted circle on the display.|$|E
