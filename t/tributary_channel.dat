5000|$|Angulomastacator (meaning [...] "bend chewer", in {{reference}} to both the shape of its upper jaw and to the Big Bend area of the Rio Grande, where the type specimen was found) is a genus of duck-billed dinosaur from the Campanian-age (Late Cretaceous) Aguja Formation of Big Bend National Park, Texas. It is known from a single specimen, TMM 43681-1, a partial left maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw). This bone is curved down approximately 45° at its anterior end, with the tooth row bent to fit, unlike any other hadrosaur.

50|$|Rosgen {{indicates}} that the consequences of incised meander are associated with accelerated stream bank erosion, land loss, aquatic habitat loss, as well as lowering the water table. Additionally, the {{study also found that}} incised meanders also cause loss of land productivity and downstream sedimentation (p. 2). The factors are likely to affect not only the economic development on the land where it passes but it is also very costly when restoration is to be initiated. river entrenchment happens because of the water having the power to cause erosion on the river bed. This increased velocity has shown a negative effect on the riparian habitat, because of increased erosion of the area. For example, a study by Simon revealed that channel incision is a major characteristic of entrenched rivers, and it affects variables in riparian vegetation and growth of fish in the areas (p. 528). Lowering of the channels means that the ground water level has also reduced. Specifically, the development of the entrenched river reduces the amount of ground water due to water loss through infiltration. The movement of the base level changes tributaries and the entrenchment of a <b>tributary</b> <b>channel.</b> Studies of various rivers have revealed that the process of river entrenchment has been associated with adjustment of river positions through bank erosion, as well as widening.|$|E

40|$|Ancient {{drainage}} systems are being increasingly {{documented in the}} Amazon basin and their characterization is crucial for reconstructing fluvial evolution in this area. Fluvial morphologies, including elongate belts, are well preserved along the Madeira River. Digital Elevation Model from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission favored the detection of these features even where they are covered by dense rainforest. These paleomorphologies are attributed to the shifting position of past tributaries of the Madeira River through avulsions. These radial paleodrainage networks produced fan-shaped morphologies that resemble distributary megafans. Distinguishing avulsive tributary systems from distributary megafans in the sedimentary record is challenging. Madeira&# 180;s paleodrainage reveals the superposition of <b>tributary</b> <b>channels</b> formed by multiple avulsions within a given time period, rather than downstream bifurcation of coexisting channels. Channel avulsion in this Amazonian area during the late Quaternary is related to tectonics due to features as: (i) straight lineaments coincident with fault directions; (ii) northeastward tilting of the terrain with Quaternary strata; and (iii) several drainage anomalies, including frequent orthogonal drainage inflections.

40|$|Managed baselevel {{lowering}} in tributaries {{that emerge from}} small canyons onto forested floodplains affects floodplain and fan sediment storage and small ephemeral <b>tributary</b> <b>channel</b> morphology in the Navarro River basin, Mendocino Country, California, USA. Numerous small tributaries (drainage areas up to several square kilometres) flow through culverts under Highway 128 across the forested floodplain of the Navarro River {{and one of its}} major tributaries, the North Fork. Excavation significantly deepened and widened these small tributaries upstream and downstream of culverts under the highway following the 1997 flood (recurrence interval 12 years), that inundated both the floodplain and the highway and culvert system. The excavation lowered the local baselevel of the tributary systems within the floodplain. This field study documents the effect of the lowered baselevel on floodplain and fan sediment storage and ephemeral <b>tributary</b> <b>channel</b> morphology. Excavation created defined channels in the floodplain where no channels previously existed. Additionally, the excavation and baselevel change created steps, or knickpoints, that migrated headward and incised the upstream tributary channels. Tributary incision decreases the sediment storage potential of the fan and floodplain and reduces the residence time for storage of fine sediment. A reduction in fine sediment residence time degrades downstream habitat for anadromous fish and other aquatic organisms in the Navarro River. Large wood influences floodplain and small <b>tributary</b> <b>channel</b> morphology by forming steps and increases sediment residence time by trapping sediment in forested tributary-fan-floodplain systems. Although this field investigation is specific to the Navarro River basin, our findings linking culvert maintenance excavation to geomorphic processes may be extended to other roads on forested floodplains in the Pacific Northwest or other systems with roads on floodplains...|$|E

To fulfill the rapid development of high-speed large-capacity optical communications with emerging multiplexing/demultiplexing techniques and advanced modulation formats, a laudable goal would be to achieve data exchange in different degrees of freedom (wavelength, time, polarization), for different modulation formats (OOK, DPSK, DQPSK, pol-muxed), and at different granularities (entire data, groups of bits, tributary channels). Optical nonlinearities are potentially suitable candidates to enable data exchange in the wavelength, time, and polarization domains.

Sediment transport from hillslope logging roads and skid trails resulted in large sediment storage in the stream channels. Riparian reserves appear to mitigate logging impacts to streams; however, more sediment {{was found in a}} <b>tributary</b> <b>channel</b> with a 20 -m buffer than an unlogged channel because some of the nearby roads and skid trails were connected to the stream. Sediment storage in channels declined within 40 months after logging in catchments with and without riparian buffers.

The volume of large wood was 1. 5 to 2 -times greater in the stream without riparian reserves than the stream of an unlogged catchment or in a stream with a riparian buffer. No consistent change in detritus accumulations was found among streams in 2001 and 2003, although more detritus was present in 2003 in all streams.

40|$|Future optical {{communication}} networks {{are likely to}} require a range of advanced OTDM channel processing functions if the full potential of the fibre transmission bandwidth is to be exploited. Critical processing functions include amongst others time-division demultiplexing, signal regeneration, channel add/drop, signal format conversion and packet compression. Ideally, these processes will be performed directly in the optical domain since this removes any bandwidth constraints {{associated with the use}} of electrical signals. In this presentation we describe various optical processing systems that exploit time-to-wavelength signal conversion. All of our systems are based on the nonlinear optical sampling of a linearly chirped pulse that is shaped and synchronised to temporally overlap with a given number of (relatively high-power) OTDM tributary channels in a fibre based switch. The individual tributary OTDM channels are mapped directly onto distinct WDM channels at the switch output by the nonlinear sampling process. Further processing of the OTDM channels can then be performed simply by passive filtering of the resulting WDM channels. If required, the filtered WDM signal can then be mapped back into the time domain onto an OTDM signal in a second nonlinear fibre switch. To highlight the power of the approach we shall present experimental demonstrations of simultaneous demultiplexing of each of the constituent tributary channels of an OTDM signal, <b>tributary</b> <b>channel</b> aggregation into compressed packets, and 10 Gbit/s multi-channel add/drop from a 40 Gbit/s TDM signal...|$|E

Here {{we examine the}} variability and spatial distribution of riparian forest responses along eight third- to fifth-order streams following a large flood (100 year recurrence interval) in the Cascade Mountain Range of Oregon. We categorized disturbance intensity (physical force) exerted on riparian trees during floods into three classes: (i) purely fluvial (high water flow only); (ii) ¯uvial supplemented by dispersed pieces of floating wood (uncongested wood transport); (iii) fluvial with movement of batches of wood (congested wood transport). These types of material transport and associated classes of disturbance intensity resulted in a gradient of biotic responses of disturbance severity ranging from standing riparian trees inundated by high water, to trees toppled but still partially rooted, to complete removal of trees. High within-stream and among stream responses were inflenced by pre-flood stream and riparian conditions as well as flood dynamics, especially the availability of individual pieces or congested batches of wood. Fluvial disturbance alone toppled fewer riparian trees than in reaches where floodwaters transported substantial amounts of wood. Debris flows delivered additional wood and sediment to parts of reaches of four of these study streams; riparian trees were removed and toppled for up to 1 5 km downstream of the debris flow <b>tributary</b> <b>channel.</b> Congested wood transport resulted in higher frequency of toppled trees and greater deposition of new wood levees along channel margins.

This comprised a hillslope slide (180 m 3, c. 203 ± 36 t), which {{coupled with the}} adjacent stream, resulting in a channelized debris flow and fluvial flood. The timing of the event is constrained between January and March 2002. The hillslope failure occurred {{in response to a}} rainfall/snowmelt trigger, on ground recently disturbed by a heather moorland fire and modified by artificial drainage. Slide and flow dynamics are estimated using reconstructed velocity and discharge values along the sediment transfer path. There is a rapid downstream reduction in both maximum velocity, from 9 · 8 to 1 · 3 m s− 1; and maximum discharge, ranging from 33 · 5 to 2 · 4 m 3 s− 1.
