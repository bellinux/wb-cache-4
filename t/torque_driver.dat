40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{present in}} vitro study was {{designed}} to compare the differences in the vertical misfit of implant-supported frameworks using three different forces for tightening the bridge locking screws: fastening by hand until first resistance, and using torque drivers with 10 and 20 Ncm. METHODS: The investigation was conducted based on the results given by 9 six-unit nickel-chromium (2 abutments/ 4 pontics) screw-retained implant-supported frameworks. The structures were exposed to simulated porcelain firings. The marginal misfit measurements were made using a traveling measuring microscope at selected screw tightening forces: fastening by hand until first resistance, and using torque drivers with 10 and 20 Ncm. The results were submitted to one-way ANOVA with repeated measures on one factor, and post hoc pairwise comparisons using Tukey test (5 %). RESULTS: The mean marginal misfit of the frameworks, fastening the screws by hand until first resistance, was 41. 56 µm (SD± 12. 45 µm). The use of <b>torque</b> <b>driver</b> devices caused a significant reduction in marginal opening (p< 0. 05). With the lowest torque available (10 Ncm), the mean marginal discrepancy at the abutment-framework interface was reduced an average of 52 % to a mean marginal opening of 19. 71 µm (SD± 2. 97 µm). After the use of the 20 Ncm <b>torque</b> <b>driver,</b> the mean marginal discrepancy of the frameworks was reduced an average of 69 % to a mean marginal opening of 12. 82 µm (SD± 4. 0 µm). Comparing the use of torque drivers with 10 and 20 Ncm torque, the means are not significantly different from one another. CONCLUSION: The seating force has an important effect on the vertical misfit measurements, once it may considerably narrow the vertical misfit gaps at the abutment-framework interface, thus leading to a misjudgment of the real marginal situation...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Using {{strain gauge}} (SG) analysis, {{the aim of}} this in vitro study was {{quantify}} the strain development during the fixation of three-unit screw implant-supported fixed partial dentures, varying the types of implant-abutment joints and the type of prosthetic coping. The hypotheses were that the type of hexagonal connection would generate different microstrains and the type of copings would produce similar microstrains after prosthetic screws had been tightened onto microunit abutments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three dental implants with external (EH) and internal (IH) hexagonal configurations were inserted into two polyurethane blocks. Microunit abutments were screwed onto their respective implant groups, applying a torque of 20 Ncm. Machined Co-Cr copings (M) and plastic prosthetic copings (P) were screwed onto the abutments, which received standard wax patterns. The wax patterns were cast in Co-Cr alloy (n= 5), forming four groups: G 1) EH/M; G 2) EH/P; G 3) IH/M and G 4) IH/P. Four SGs were bonded onto the surface of the block tangentially to the implants, SG 1 mesially to implant 1, SG 2 and SG 3 mesially and distally to implant 2, respectively, and SG 4 distally to implant 3. The superstructure's occlusal screws were tightened onto microunit abutments with 10 Ncm torque using a manual <b>torque</b> <b>driver.</b> The magnitude of microstrain on each SG was recorded in units of microstrain (µ&# 949;). The data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test (p 0. 05). The hypotheses were partially accepted.

The purpose of this animal study was to evaluate the removal torque of unloaded titanium implants in the fibula, the scapula and the iliac crest. Ninety implants with a sandblasted and acid-etched (SLA) surface were tested after healing periods of 3, 6, and 12 weeks, respectively. Removal torque values (RTV) were collected using a computerized counterclockwise <b>torque</b> <b>driver.</b> The bicortical anchored 8 mm implants in the fibula revealed values of 63. 73 Ncm, 91. 50 Ncm, and 101. 83 Ncm at 3, 6, and 12 weeks, respectively. The monocortical anchorage in the iliac crest showed values of 71. 40 Ncm, 63. 14 Ncm, and 61. 59 Ncm with 12 mm implants at the corresponding times. The monocortical anchorage in the scapula demonstrated mean RTV of 62. 28 Ncm, 97. 63 Ncm, and 99. 7 Ncm with 12 mm implants at 3, 6, and 12 weeks, respectively. The study showed an increase of removal torque with increasing healing time. The interfacial strength for bicortical anchored 8 mm implants in the fibula was comparable to monocortical anchored 12 mm implants in the iliac crest and the scapula at the corresponding times.

40|$|This {{invention}} comprises a {{torque drive}} mechanism utilizing axially translatable, mutually engageable transmission members having mating crown gears, driven and driving members with a three-element drive train being biased together by resilient means or by a fluid actuator system, the apparatus being operable to transmit a precisely controlled degree of torque to a driven member. The apparatus is applicable {{for use in}} hand tools and {{as a replacement for}} impact torque drivers, torque wrenches, motorized screw drivers, or the like, wherein the applied torque must be precisely controlled or limited. The bevel torque drive includes a drive gear which is axially displaceable and rotatable within cylindrical driver housing, a rotatable intermediate gear, and an output gear. Key rotationally secures displaceable gear with respect to input shaft but permits axial movement therebetween. A thrust bearing is preferably connected to the lower end of shaft for support to reduce play and friction between shaft and a transmission joint disc during rotation of the gear train. Coaxially mounted coiled spring is footed against displaceable gear for biasing the displaceable gear toward and into engagement with the intermediate gear for driving intermediate gear and output gear. Torque control is achieved by the use of straight or spiral beveled gears which are of configurations adapted to withdraw from mutual engagement upon the torque exceeding a predetermined limit. The novel, advantageous features of the invention include the configuration of the mating, crown gear sets and the axially translatable, slidable drive gear. The mechanism is capable of transmitting a high degree of torque within a narrow, compact transmission housing. The compact size and narrow, elongated configuration of the housing is particularly applicable for use in hand tools and in multiple <b>torque</b> <b>driver</b> mechanisms in which it is necessary to drive multiple fasteners which are located in close proximity.

40|$|Haptic {{steering}} guidance is {{an advanced}} driving assistance system which provides guidance torques {{on the steering}} wheel to assist a human driver. Improvements in performance, safety margins and workload have been reported for lane-keeping and curve negotiation tasks. On the other hand, the guidance system instigates increased <b>driver</b> <b>torques,</b> indicating the occurrence of a mismatch between driver and automation intention. A novel, criticality-based control structure was developed, capable of adapting to different driving conditions by using safety margins (operationalized as time-to-line crossing, TLC) as input. Twenty-four participants drove through a single-lane, 10. 8 km long road, with as independent variables the road width (normal road width of 3 m, wide road width of 5 m) and the type of guidance received: no guidance (manual), haptic steering guidance based on lateral deviation from the center-line (performance-based guidance, PBG) and criticality-based guidance (CBG). On the normal road, results show similar benefits for both guidance systems compared to manual control, in terms of performance and safety margins. Workload was reduced by PBG, but both guidance systems yielded increased <b>driver</b> <b>torques.</b> On the wide road, participants drove closer to the center-line with PBG, but at the cost of significantly more guidance torques than CBG. Interestingly, this reduction in lateral deviation did not result in a significant improvement for lowest safety margins encountered. No subjective preference was found for either feedback condition. It can be concluded that criticality-based guidance is capable of adjusting to different driving conditions, without compromising safety margins, whilst greatly reducing guidance torques in situations where they are unneeded. <br/...|$|R
