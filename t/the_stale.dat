25|$|In {{the period}} {{following}} the initial {{construction of the}} dam in the late 1970s, the lake began to deteriorate due to low rainfall and poor water flows, which saw lake weed overtake the swimming areas. The lake weed eventually became a drowning hazard that {{claimed the lives of}} swimmers over the preceding decade. In this sense, the project was a failure, and Lake Moana-Nui was considered unsafe. In an effort to control the problems, signs were erected banning access to the dam wall, and basic handrailing was put up to prevent public access. The lake was subject to regular draining in an effort to control the weed and to flush out <b>the</b> <b>stale,</b> stagnant water. While this did slightly improve the situation in the short term, people were warned not to swim in it. The lake is undergoing a major cleaning project {{so that it can be}} used in the future. To date (as at 25 April 2015), Lake Moana-Nui has been fully drained, refilled, and restored - and has been cleared by the local council for public recreation (as it was in its heyday during the 1970s and 80's).|$|E

[...] According to Lark Anderson of GameSpot, [...] "Shattered Memories is a fantastic return to the core concept of personal fear, and though its developers made some unorthodox decisions—such as removing combat entirely—those decisions have paid off handsomely." [...] Nintendo Power called it audacious and compelling. In a retrospective feature, Nintendo World Report's Jonathan Metts generally agreed with Gamespot, stating that the installment [...] "is a noble and arguably successful attempt to revive and reform the survival horror genre. While perhaps not scary, it is genuinely disturbing, shocking, and always interesting." [...] According to Leigh Alexander of The A.V.

500|$|Ramones was {{released}} on April 23, 1976 by Sire Records and received glowing reviews. In May, John Rockwell of the New York Times published a rave review, saying: [...] "What the Ramones do is deliver a nonstop set of short, brisk, monochromatically intense songs. [...] conventional considerations of pace and variety are thrown calculatedly to the winds. The ingredients are simplicity itself." [...] Rockwell noted: [...] "the effect in the end amounts to an abstraction of rock so pure that other associations get left behind." [...] Nick Kent favourably commented in the NME: [...] "This record poses {{a direct threat to}} any vaguely sensitive woofer and/or tweeter lodged in your hi-fi...". Critic Robert Christgau in The Village Voice gave the album a positive review, specifically writing about the album's themes and sound quality. In July, Paul Nelson of Rolling Stone wrote in 1976 that the album was similar to early rock and roll, and was constructed using rhythm tracks of great intensity. In August, Creem dubbed The Ramones as [...] "The most radical album of the past six years", saying: [...] " [...] is so strikingly different, so brazenly out of touch with prevailing modes as to constitute a bold swipe at the status quo." [...] Reviewer Gene Sculatti saw it as [...] "a rock 'n' roll reactionary's manifesto" [...] "a sharp wedge between <b>the</b> <b>stale</b> ends of a contemporary music scene bloated with graying superstars and overripe for takeover." [...] Critic Joe S. Harrington declared that the album was a huge landmark for music history, proclaiming that [...] " [...] split the history of rock 'n' roll in half." [...] Theunis Bates, a writer for Time, summed the album up with: [...] "Ramones stripped rock back to its basic elements... lyrics are very simple, boiled-down declarations of teen lust and need." [...] Bates also said that it [...] "is the ultimate punk statement." [...] Charles M.
