Davis) reports to the Syndicate on the alien in Phoenix, confident that he'll be able to kill it. Assistant Director Walter Skinner tells Mulder, {{who is working on}} restoring the burned X-Files, that Mulder and Scully have been denied reassignment on the X-Files, but that Mulder should seek out a folder left on <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> <b>in</b> his old office. Mulder goes there, only to discover that Jeffrey Spender and Diana Fowley have been assigned to the X-Files. Feeling betrayed by Fowley, Mulder leaves, but not before stealthily taking the folder with him.|$|E

25|$|An {{immediate}} controversy arose {{about an}} article regarding the Dawson shootings by journalist Jan Wong, of the Toronto-based Globe and Mail. Three {{days after the}} event, Wong, who {{was born and raised}} in Montreal and is the daughter of Chinese immigrants, wrote a front-page piece titled Get under <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>in</b> which she drew a link between all three school shootings in Quebec history (the École Polytechnique, the Concordia University and the Dawson College killings) and the nature of the Quebec society and its protective language laws.|$|E
2500|$|Another, less prosaic, way of {{thinking}} of 'equipment' is as 'stuff we can work with' around us, along with its context. [...] "The paper we can do things with, from <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>in</b> the university, in the city, on the world, in the universe." [...] 'Equipment' refers to the thing, and its usefulness possibilities, and its context.|$|E
2500|$|President John F. Kennedy first {{placed it}} in the Oval Office in 1961. The desk left the White House from 1963 until President Carter brought {{it back to the}} Oval Office. Since then, former presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump have used it in the Oval Office. Some presidents, such as George H. W. Bush, have used <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> <b>in</b> their private study rather than in the Oval Office.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, in the 1950s and 1960s, {{cigarette}} brands {{were frequently}} sponsors of television programs. One {{of the most}} famous television jingles of the era came from an advertisement for Winston cigarettes. The slogan [...] "Winston tastes good like a cigarette should!" [...] proved to be catchy. Another popular slogan from the 1960s was [...] "Us Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch!," [...] which was used to advertise Tareyton cigarettes. America's first regular television news program, Camel News Caravan, was sponsored by Camel Cigarettes and featured an ashtray on <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> <b>in</b> front of the newscaster and the Camel logo behind him. The show ran from 1949 to 1956.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 June 1981, while Khamenei had {{returned}} from the frontline, {{he went to the}} Aboozar Mosque according to his Saturdays schedule. After the first prayer, he began to give lecture to worshipers who had wrote their questions on the paper. Meanwhile, a tape recorder accompanied with papers was put on <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> <b>in</b> front of Khamenei by a young man who pressed a button. After a minute the loud speaker’s sound become like whistle and suddenly the tape recorder exploded. [...] "A gift of Furqan Group to Islamic republic", it was written on the inner wall of the tape recorder. The treatment duration of [...] Ayatollah [...] Khamenei [...] took several month and his arm, vocal chords and lungs were seriously injured. He was permanently injured, losing the use of his right arm.|$|E
2500|$|There are exact {{replicas of}} the Resolute desk on display in at least five presidential libraries. The desk at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library was recreated by Robert Whitley. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California; the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, California; and the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum in Atlanta, Georgia, include {{replicas of the}} Resolute desk. [...] The desks at the William J.

2500|$|The second {{modification}} {{was done}} to raise the desk by adding a separate, uniform base called a plinth. [...] The first time a base was made for the Resolute Desk was during the John F. Kennedy Administration. [...] This base was made of pine and did not match the desk very well. [...] That base is very visible in the famous photo of John F. Kennedy Jr. playing under the Resolute Desk. In January 1977, President Carter requested the desk {{be sent back to}} the White House from the Smithsonian Institution. [...] Photos from January–February 1977 show the Resolute Desk being used with a base, but the base had been removed by late May of that year, when it was photographed without it. White House record photos from early in Ronald Reagan's presidency, one as late as October 23, 1981, show the desk being used without a base. President Reagan requested that the desk be raised higher since he was hitting his legs {{on the top of the}} knee hole. The White House's earliest image of the desk with a base during the Reagan Administration is dated August 13, 1982. A new, better-fitting base was built for <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> <b>in</b> 1986, and that base has remained with the desk since that time.|$|E
2500|$|For the memorial's 60th {{anniversary in}} 1992, the George Washington museum {{exhibited}} a special collection of Washingtoniana. [...] A rhinestone Past Master's Masonic [...] "jewel," [...] owned by Martha Washington and {{sold by the}} Washington family {{at the time of}} her death was part of the display. Also loaned to the museum was <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> <b>in</b> the Maryland Statehouse on which Washington resigned his commission in the Continental Army at the end of the American Revolution. The Washington museum's collection was recataloged at this time as well. This led to some historic discoveries. It had long been known that the Washington family Bible had a half-page of the family torn out, but the recataloging discovered that one of Washington's descendants had ripped it out to go into the cornerstone of the Washington Monument on July 4, 1848. A map, hand-drawn by Washington to show the route a British military expedition took to Ohio in 1790, turned up in a desk. Also uncovered was a book on the use of artillery sent to Washington by a Scotsman, and a 1798 encyclopedia (the first printed in America) specially ordered by Washington. Researchers also uncovered a print of Washington's deathbed scene, and the stub of a candle carried by Freemasons in a ceremony after his death.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{demo version}} of the album was put down in Artane, Dickens {{requested}} to have it re-recorded digitally at a more professional studio as the analogue equipment used at Aigle had created an abundance of tape hiss, causing the music to suffer. Nicky found the quality of Enya's multi-track vocals had also diminished, leaving them the only option of re-recording them, though he later found digital record had lost [...] "warmth in the bottom end". With studio time booked at Orinoco Studios in Bermondsey, London, Enya and Nicky re-recorded and mastered Watermark with Ross Cullum who carried out co-production, engineering, and mixing duties. [...] "Storms in Africa" [...] and [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] were completed on the studio's two Mitsubishi 32-track recording machines. Away from the [...] "intimate and personal" [...] setting of recording in Ireland, Enya found working in London more difficult as the busy city caused many distractions. Cullum completed {{the majority of the}} album's mixing at Wessex Sound Studios, with Jim Barton credited as the mixer on [...] "Orinoco Flow". During the final stages of recording, Enya tripped on a step which resulted in two cuts to her knee. She continued to work, [...] "taking these heavy pain-killers, sitting at <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>in</b> the studio with one foot propped up on cushions." [...] Recording finished in April 1988, ten months after it began.|$|E
