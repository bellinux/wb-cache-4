5|$|Besides {{the series}} Phineas and Ferb, Phineas has been {{featured}} in several other pieces of merchandise from the series. To date, he has appeared in all Phineas and Ferb novelizations, published by Disney Press. Phineas appears in the Nintendo DS video game based on the series, simply titled Phineas and Ferb. Dan Povenmire has said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> nothing of the game until its release, on which {{he was given a}} copy for free.|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> which <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> was {{sufficient}} to cause his heart to beat rapidly.|$|R

5|$|Concurrent {{with these}} events, Mary Margaret (Goodwin) {{continues}} {{to visit the}} amnesiac David (Joshua Dallas) at the hospital. At the same time, Kathryn (Anastasia Griffith) also continues to visit David, showing him pictures to jog his memory but later admits, although he claimed otherwise to Kathryn, to Mary Margaret that he doesn't remember anything <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> in the pictures. As Mary Margaret notices David becoming more attracted to her, she still feels threatened by Kathryn's presence. This prompts Mary Margaret to submit her letter of resignation as a volunteer at the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Corman had initial {{trouble finding}} {{distribution}} for the film, as some distributors, including American International Pictures (AIP), felt that the film would be interpreted as anti-Semitic, citing the characters of Gravis Mushnick and Siddie Shiva. Welles, who is Jewish, stated that he gave his character a Turkish Jewish accent and mannerisms, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the humor of the film as playful, and felt there was no intent to defame any ethnic group. The film was finally released by its production company, The Filmgroup, nine months after it had been completed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the chaotic}} {{days after the}} war, {{contradictory}} reports arose as to Bormann's whereabouts. Sightings were reported in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere. Bormann's wife was placed under surveillance in case he tried to contact her. Jakob Glas, Bormann's long-time chauffeur, insisted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Bormann in Munich in July 1946. In case Bormann was still alive, multiple public notices about the upcoming Nuremberg trials were placed in newspapers and on the radio in October and November 1945 to notify him of the proceedings against him.|$|E
60|$|Johnny {{always held}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never had so glad {{a moment in}} all his life as <b>that</b> when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> her countenance light up.|$|R
60|$|Mr. George {{said it was}} {{the most}} {{imposing}} spectacle <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>saw.</b>|$|R
60|$|For {{this man}} had one {{precious}} possession; which he determined not to lose, not though he died in trying to hold it fast; namely, the Eternal Spirit of God; the Spirit of Righteousness, and Truth, and Justice, which leads men into all truth. By <b>that</b> Spirit <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> into the Eternal Laws of God. By <b>that</b> Spirit <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> who made and who administers those Eternal Laws, even the Eternal Word of God, who endureth for ever in heaven. By <b>that</b> Spirit <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> his only hope was to keep those eternal laws. By <b>that</b> Spirit <b>he</b> vowed to keep them. By <b>that</b> Spirit <b>he</b> had strength to keep them. By <b>that</b> Spirit, when <b>he</b> failed he tried again; when he fell he rose and fought on once more, to keep the commandments of the Lord.|$|R
5|$|Family {{and family}} history also plays an {{important}} role in the poem. Eliot found information on his family from Sketch of the Eliot Family, which described how Eliot's family lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he disrupted the family history. Similarly, Eliot broke from his own family when he travelled away from his family, a family <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> was declining. Within the poem, Eliot emphasizes the need for a journey and the need for inward change.|$|E
5|$|Gauguin {{asked that}} Oviri {{be placed on}} his grave, which seems to {{indicate}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the figure as his alter ego and the fox as changeable in its gender as he was (according to Mathews) and thus symbolic of dangerous sexuality. A number of sources indicate that Gauguin was suffering at the time from a syphilitic rash that prevented him from travelling to Tahiti for several months. She suggests the orifice is a pars pro toto for the woman who infected him.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, LaBeouf {{spoke about}} the {{plagiarism}} accusations with Bleeding Cool writer Rich Johnston, where he stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> copyright laws as too restrictive and {{that it did not}} allow for ideas to flow freely. LaBeouf later tweeted a description of his next project, Daniel Boring (a reference to David Boring, another comic created by Clowes). The description of the project was also taken word-for-word from a description by Clowes of his comic. Clowes' attorney, Michael Kump, has since sent a cease-and-desist letter to LaBeouf's attorney, which LaBeouf posted on Twitter.|$|E
50|$|McKenzie in 1976 {{published}} {{a review of}} the idea up to <b>that</b> point. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> three general variations of turnpike theories.|$|R
50|$|Haeberle later testified <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{personally}} <b>saw</b> about 30 different American soldiers kill about 100 civilians.|$|R
50|$|Paxton then is {{told that}} Bozz died in Vietnam {{but he was}} never listed, others say he just disappeared, but another soldier calls Paxton and says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thinks <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Bozz three years ago in Mexico with a {{beautiful}} woman.|$|R
5|$|Lang's {{region of}} Stepney within the Diocese of London {{extended}} {{over the whole}} area generally known as London's East End, with two million people in more than 200parishes. Almost all were poor, and housed in overcrowded and insanitary conditions. Lang knew something of the area from his undergraduate activities at Toynbee Hall, and his conscience was troubled by the squalor <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as he travelled around the district, usually by bus and tram.|$|E
5|$|On July 27, 2015, Robinson {{signed a}} three-year {{deal with the}} Indiana Pacers. Pacer General Manager Larry Bird noted {{that he had been}} {{attempting}} to acquire Robinson for some time due to the potential <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw.</b> He hooked Robinson up with shooting guru Hal Wissel for extra attention during his first offseason. Robinson entered the season impaired by shoulder soreness and did not dress for the October 28 season opener. Robinson began practicing with the team at the beginning of November as he recovered from his shoulder injury.|$|E
5|$|Sharon visits Skinner at his home. After {{she leaves}} he falls asleep, seeing {{the old woman}} again. He awakens as detectives enter the house, telling him Sharon has been run {{off the road and}} {{severely}} injured. Skinner admits to Mulder <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the woman during his experience in Vietnam, but passed it off as being due to drugs. It is revealed that The Smoking Man is observing their conversation through the one-way mirror of the interrogation room.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> {{paused at}} <b>that,</b> for <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> his father wince {{at the picture}} like a man {{physically}} struck; and again there was silence.|$|R
50|$|On 7 June {{he was in}} the air at 04.00 when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> three <b>He</b> 111s. He {{attacked}} the two, hitting one <b>that</b> <b>he</b> last <b>saw</b> flying damaged towards the Swedish border, claiming this as a victory.|$|R
60|$|The sun clambered to midday, {{and once}} <b>that</b> morning <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> though the Germans did not, an Asiatic airship very {{far to the}} south, going swiftly eastward.|$|R
5|$|The defense, {{to support}} their theory that Conley murdered Phagan in a robbery, focused on Phagan's missing purse. Conley claimed in court <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Frank place the purse in his office safe, {{although}} he denied having seen the purse before the trial. Another witness testified that, on the Monday after the murder, the safe was open {{and there was no}} purse in it. The significance of Phagan's torn pay envelope was disputed by both sides.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{has three}} eleven-line stanzas which {{describe}} a progression through the season, {{from the late}} maturation of the crops to the harvest and to {{the last days of}} autumn when winter is nearing. The imagery is richly achieved through the personification of Autumn, and the description of its bounty, its sights and sounds. It has parallels in the work of English landscape artists, with Keats himself describing the fields of stubble <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> on his walk as being like that in a painting.|$|E
5|$|The tower cab {{coordinator}} on duty at {{the time}} of the accident stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a fireball emanating from the crash site following the accident. Upon seeing the flames, he sounded an alarm, alerting the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police, who responded. An investigation revealed that there were technical issues with an emergency telephone at LaGuardia, however it was found that these issues did not hinder the emergency response.|$|E
60|$|John Simcoe was {{the last}} witness called. He gave his {{evidence}} to the effect <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had seen the body, and <b>that</b> personally <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> {{no reason to doubt}} that it was that of Walter Rivington.|$|R
50|$|Oppenheimer also {{considered}} capitalism {{as a system}} of exploitation and capital revenues as the gain of <b>that</b> exploitation. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> the state as the original creator of inequality.|$|R

5|$|Wander's horse, Agro, plays a {{large role}} in the game. In {{addition}} to serving as a means of transportation, fighting from horseback is vital to defeat some of the colossi. There are, however, many environments that cannot be traversed by horse, and colossi often inhabit areas within deep water or beyond large obstacles that must be scaled. Agro cannot travel beyond these, and when separated from Wander by such obstacles, cannot participate in the following battle. Agro is referred to as a male in the English-language version of the game, though director Fumito Ueda said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Wander's horse as female.|$|E
5|$|When {{writing the}} album's lyrics, Yamaguchi tried to express both the {{feelings}} that he had, and those <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> were common in society in the early 2010s. He focused on questioning what {{the role of a}} musician was during this period; and attempted to represent the idea of certain types of people existing in 2011, making certain types of music. He believed that the true role of a musician had become strongly evident after the earthquake. The band also tried to express 2011 sonically, through the style of synths that pianist Emi Okazaki created for the songs.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt and Virgil Earp and Doc Holliday {{believed}} that Tom had a revolver {{at the time}} of the gunfight. Wyatt thought Tom fired a revolver under the horse's neck and believed until he died that Tom's revolver had been removed from the scene by Wesley Fuller. Witness Fallehy wrote <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday shooting at a man who was using a horse to barricade himself, and once shot the man fell. In his statement, Fallehy wrote that the man still held his pistol in his hand. Although he did not see him shoot, he thought Tom McLaury was armed.|$|E

"Put {{the case}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{lived in an}} {{atmosphere}} of evil, and <b>that</b> all <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain destruction. Put the case <b>that</b> <b>he</b> often <b>saw</b> children solemnly tried at a criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case <b>that</b> <b>he</b> habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported, neglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing up to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to his net,--to be prosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow." ...|$|R
