25|$|The last {{regularly}} scheduled passenger train {{passed through the}} tunnel in 1958. As of 2012, the tunnel is part of Pan Am Railways, formerly the Guilford Rail System, with trains operated by subsidiary Springfield Terminal Railway, and the property and infrastructure owned by subsidiary Boston and Maine Corporation. The route is currently used to transport freight, but sees rare excursion trains for some special occasions. It was converted to single track in 1957. Clearances were increased in 1997 and 2007, the former by lowering the track, the latter by grinding 15inches off the roof, allowing <b>trailer</b> <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> (TOFC) and tri-level automobile carriers to pass. In March 2012, the Federal Railroad Administration awarded a $2 million grant to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation for preliminary engineering on further increasing clearance in the tunnel to allow double stack container trains to use the tunnel.|$|E
2500|$|NS {{is a major}} {{transporter}} {{of domestic}} and export coal. The railroad's major sources of the mineral are located in: Pennsylvania's Cambria and Indiana counties, {{as well as the}} Monongahela Valley; West Virginia; and the Appalachia regions of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. In Pennsylvania, NS also receives coal through interchange with R.J. Corman Railroad/Pennsylvania Lines at Cresson, Pennsylvania, originating in the [...] "Clearfield Cluster". NS's export of West Virginia bituminous coal begins transport on portions of the well-engineered former Virginian Railway and the former N double-tracked line in Eastern Virginia to its Lambert's Point coal pier on Hampton Roads at Norfolk. Coal transported by NS is thus exported to steel mills and power plants around the world. The company is also a major transporter of auto parts and completed vehicles. It operates intermodal container and TOFC (<b>trailer</b> <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>car)</b> trains, some in conjunction with other railroads. NS was the first railway to employ roadrailers, which are highway truck trailers with interchangeable wheel sets.|$|E
50|$|Spine cars, <b>trailer</b> <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>car,</b> or {{piggy back}} cars allow two 28.5 ft trailer pups or one {{semi-trailer}} up to 57 ft to be carried. They usually come in articulated sets of 5 or 3.|$|E
5000|$|Tropicana {{purchased}} {{one million}} dollars worth of refrigerated trucks to deliver Pure Premium. Soon, 2,000 dairies delivered Pure Premium orange juice to the doorsteps of consumers each morning. By 1958, a ship, S.S. Tropicana, was taking [...] of juice to New York each week from the new base at Cape Canaveral, Florida. From 1960 to 1970, Tropicana utilized TOFC (<b>trailers</b> <b>on</b> <b>flatbed</b> <b>cars)</b> to move the juice more efficiently.|$|R
30|$|The {{tactical}} planning problem which Clausen and Voll [4] develop in their paper reflects a position primarily aimed at cost reduction rather than seeking revenue/profit maximization {{and has become}} detached from the prevailing operational and commercial pressures set by shippers. The routing of wagons /freight cars either individually or in blocks is subject to a mass of technical, operational and commercial imperatives so a generalised model (Blocking Problem) aimed primarily to reduce costs could readily lose touch {{with the reality of}} sustaining a routinely commercially competitive portfolio of service offers. The impact of inter-modal traffic further complicates this position with a range of product and service offers available in North America including <b>trailers</b> <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> (TOFC), twin stack domestic and twin stack international containers. These very high productivity options are not yet available in Europe although European inter-modal traffic operation is so far efficient and effective within the constraints of the infrastructure.|$|R
5000|$|The peak of {{rail freight}} came during World War II, when New York industries, {{including}} the Brooklyn Navy Yard, worked {{around the clock}} to support the war effort. After the war, the Interstate Highway System was built, along with many inland waterways, both competing with the railroads. The rail industry went through widespread consolidations and bankruptcies. Containerization revolutionized shipping. The Port Authority developed the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal on Newark Bay. Piers in Brooklyin and Manhattan declined in usage and were abandoned. The 1980 Staggers Rail Act largely deregulated the U.S. railroads. The railroads de-emphasized [...] "retail" [...] railroading—movement of {{one or a few}} rail cars from a shipper's siding to a destination siding—in favor of long unit trains for bulk commodities, such as coal and ore. General cargo shifted to intermodal movement, first <b>trailers</b> <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> (TOFC), intermodal containers <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> (COFC), and then double-stacked containers, loaded on special well cars. Much manufacturing shifted to Asia, particularly Japan and China, leading to a sharp increase in international container movements.|$|R
5000|$|The railroad's traffic {{consists}} {{largely of}} general freight, including lumber products, metals, chemicals and stone products, although COFC (container on flat car) and TOFC (<b>trailer</b> <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>car)</b> business is also operated from the Canada-US border to Boston, {{in partnership with}} the Providence and Worcester Railroad. [...] The NECR hauled around 37,000 carloads in 2008.|$|E
50|$|A TOFC (<b>trailer</b> <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>car,</b> a.k.a. piggy-back) car once again, {{is usually}} an 89 ft car. In the past, these carried three 30 ft {{trailers}} which are, as of 2007, almost obsolete, or one large, 53 ft, two 40 ft or 45 ft trailers. As intermodal traffic grows, these dedicated flats are in decline. Most have been modified to also carry containers. One notable type is Canadian Pacific Railway's XTRX service—dedicated five-unit flats that only carry trailers.|$|E
5000|$|Traffic on the River Subdivision {{consists}} {{mostly of}} long distance trains composed of intermodal, TOFC (<b>Trailer</b> <b>On</b> <b>Flat</b> <b>Car),</b> unit, and mixed commodity trains.Traffic density varies, but on weekdays, {{you can expect}} to see 15 to 20 trains during daylight hours. Saturdays can provide 18-24 trains during the day, Sundays may only have 8-14 trains. Again, this can vary greatly, depending on available crews, track work, etc. You can expect to see 2-5 oil trains and 1-2 ethanol trains per day.(2015) ...|$|E
5000|$|Along {{with the}} {{passenger}} service, Highbridge {{also had a}} tractor trailer/freight yard where trucks would load their <b>trailers</b> <b>on</b> to <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> for [...] "piggyback" [...] service and at one time had a pier to load freight cars on barges when the Central owned its own fleet of tugboats and car carriers. The passenger station was closed and demolished in the late 1970s and the freight yard now serves as a maintenance facility of the Metro-North Railroad.|$|R
25|$|Although railroads {{were just}} {{beginning}} to see the advantages that autoracks delivered in the 1960s, most North American railroads were reluctant to invest in such specially built equipment. The Trailer Train Company, organized by the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1955, stepped in to ease the railroads' financial burden a bit. Trailer Train purchased the <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> from the rail car manufacturers, and the railroads that wanted to operate autoracks, purchased the racks that were installed <b>on</b> those <b>flat</b> <b>cars.</b> Such cars were easily spotted at trackside due to the reporting marks identifying <b>Trailer</b> Train <b>on</b> the <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> portion of the car and the railroad's logo (usually much larger) in the upper portion of the rack.|$|R

50|$|By the 1980s {{the system}} would own 11,469 miles of rail line over 11 states bounded by Chicago to the east, Pueblo, Colorado, in the west, north to Omaha, south to the U.S.-Mexico border in Laredo, Texas, and {{southeast}} along the Gulf seaports of Louisiana and Texas. MoPac operated a fleet of more than 1,500 diesel locomotives, almost all purchased within the previous 10 years. Under the leadership of Downing B. Jenks, who became {{president and chief executive}} in 1961 the company became a pioneer {{in the early days of}} computer-guided rail technology. It was a major hauler of grain, TOFC (<b>Trailer</b> <b>on</b> <b>Flat</b> <b>Car),</b> coal, ore, autos and dry goods. At the time of their mega-merger in 1982 the MoPac owned newer locomotives, more locomotives and operated more track than partner Union Pacific Railroad.|$|E
50|$|In some {{countries}} rolling highway, or rolling road, trains are used; trucks can drive straight onto {{the train and}} drive off again when the end destination is reached. A system like this is used on the Channel Tunnel between the United Kingdom and France, {{as well as on}} the Konkan Railway in India. In other countries, the tractor unit of each truck is not carried on the train, only the trailer. Piggy back trains are common in the United States, where they are also known as <b>trailer</b> <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> or TOFC trains, but they have lost market share to containers (COFC), with longer, 53-foot containers frequently used for domestic shipments. There are also roadrailer vehicles, which have two sets of wheels, for use in a train, or as the trailer of a road vehicle.|$|E

50|$|One {{reason for}} the fire's long {{duration}} involved the lack of national standards in firefighting equipment. Despite fire engines from nearby cities (such as Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. as well as units from New York City, Virginia, Wilmington, and Atlantic City) responding with horse-drawn pumpers, wagons and other related equipment (primitive by modern-day standards, but only steam engines were motorized in that era) carried by the railroads <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> and box cars, many were unable to help since their hose couplings could not fit Baltimore's fire hydrants.|$|R

In 1996, the CPR introduced a scheduled reservation-only short-haul intermodal service between Montreal and West Toronto called the Iron Highway; it utilized unique equipment that was later replaced (1999) by conventional piggyback flatcars and renamed Expressway. This service was extended to Detroit with plans to reach Chicago however CP was unable to locate a suitable terminal.|$|R
