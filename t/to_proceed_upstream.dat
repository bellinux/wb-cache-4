25|$|The next year, the IRA {{was able}} to repeat the same {{operation}} against another British coal ship, the St. Bedan, bound from Glasgow to Derry. The 1,250 BRT Bedan, built in Clyde and also launched in 1972, was owned by J & A Gardner & Co. Ltd. of Glasgow. On February 23, 1982, the ship was at anchor off Derry, awaiting the tide <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>upstream.</b>|$|E
50|$|The embassy {{departed}} Macao on 23 June. It {{stopped in}} Zhoushan, where Staunton went ashore {{to meet with}} the military governor of Dinghai. The emperor had sent instructions to every port in China to provide pilots to guide the British visitors, and the governor did so. However, Chinese officials had not anticipated that the British intended to sail the high seas rather than hopping from port to port in shallow waters along the coast, as was typical of Chinese vessels. They expressed surprise at the size and speed of the British ships. Anticipating that these vessels with their deep hulls would not be able <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>upstream</b> past Tianjin, they hired boats to carry the mission and its cargo to the capital.|$|E
50|$|The {{navigation}} {{left the}} Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal immediately opposite Baswich Salt Works. A roving bridge carried the canal towpath over the channel, which headed north. A small aqueduct carried {{it over a}} drainage ditch, and into the lock. At normal river levels, {{the fall of the}} lock was about 6.5 ft. The course turned to the north-west, to join the River Sow, with the towpath on the south bank. Most traffic turned left, <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>upstream,</b> but boats could also reach St Thomas flour mill a little way downstream, although this was not advisable when the river was in flood. Immediately after the junction, the River Penk joined the Sow, and a footbridge carried the towpath over the confluence.|$|E
50|$|Service to Corvallis {{required}} a sufficient level {{of water in}} the river. As of December 4, 1912, with recent rainfall the river was 4 feet above low water level, considered, by M.P. Baldwin, of O.C.T.C., to be insufficient to allow Grahamona <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> further <b>upstream</b> than Salem.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper reach}} {{can be defined}} as the portion of Calabazas Creek north of its {{crossing}} of State Route 12, which point lies approximately three miles upstream of the confluence with Sonoma Creek. Initially there are two large ranches on either side of Calabazas Creek: Beltane Ranch to the west and Atwood Ranch <b>to</b> the east. <b>Proceeding</b> <b>upstream</b> for the next mile, there is continuous close viewing of the creek, since Nunns Canyon Road runs {{near the top of the}} west stream banks. An abandoned rock quarry is situated about 0.3 miles (500 m) north of State Route 12 on the west bank.|$|R
50|$|The Itchen Bridge is a toll {{bridge that}} crosses the River Itchen, from Woolston to the Chapel area of Southampton near Ocean Village and St. Mary's Stadium. The bridge was opened to traffic on 1 June 1977 and {{formally}} named on 13 June 1977 by Princess Alexandra. Costing £5.7 million, the high-level concrete bridge spans 107 m between its central pillars and carries two lanes of traffic 24 m above the river, allowing large vessels <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> further <b>upstream</b> <b>to</b> the wharfs and quays in Northam. Tolls are charged for vehicles crossing the bridge, toll booths and a control room are {{situated at the}} Woolston end, however pedestrians, cyclists and now motorcyclists travel free. A cable ferry served Woolston from 1938 until {{the opening of the}} bridge. Prior to the Woolston Floating Bridge, the Itchen ferry boats provided transport across the River Itchen.|$|R
5000|$|On {{reaching}} Macau, Anson sent 60 or 70 prisoners ashore {{before the}} Chinese stopped him unloading the rest {{and then made}} way for Canton, intending this time not to be trifled with by the Chinese. The mandarin {{in charge of the}} fort at Bocca Tigris came aboard but was intimidated by the ships heavy guns and instead tried to persuade the hired pilots to misguide the ship through the shoals. On learning of this, Anson threatened to hang one of them if the ship ran aground. Once past the forts, the ship waited for the permit <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>upstream.</b> Anson ordered that one of the heavy guns be fired twice a day to remind everyone that there was a new power to be dealt with. After two weeks and some politics, the permit arrived allowing him to get to Whampoa, just short of Canton and most of the prisoners were put onto boats to be taken to Macau. He was able to secure fresh provisions but the merchants would not supply [...] "sea provisions". Anson was anxious to put his case directly to the Viceroy and had issued a request on arrival but been told to wait till after summer. Anson sent a message saying he would arrive on 1 October but as they were about to set off one messenger said that the Viceroy wanted to postpone the meeting and then another camesaying that he had waited all day and was offended that Anson had not showed up.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{mechanisms}} of failure of levees is a phenomenon called ??piping,?? which generally begins {{with the formation of}} a sand boil at the leeward side of the levee, and has been frequently observed <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>upstream</b> along the base of the levee through a slit formation. The issue of most important concern is to estimate the critical head that could promote the occurrence of piping. Considering the flow through porous media and coupling it with Bernoulli?s equation and a critical tractive stress condition, a model is developed for the critical head. Using appropriate transformations, the proposed model takes on a form which supports Bligh?s empirical findings. Another model based on critical velocity is also developed to estimate the critical head. The functional form of these two models is evaluated using the critical head versus porosity data from a number of laboratory studies conducted in the Netherlands. These models were found to perform better than did Terzaghi?s model...|$|E
50|$|The Hindiya Barrage was {{constructed}} from 1911 to 1913, upstream {{from the old}} dam and next to the actual bed of the Hindiya branch. A new river bed leading up {{to and from the}} barrage was excavated and inundated after completion of the dam, and the old river bed was closed off by dams. Furthermore, because the barrage was also located upstream from the headwater of the Hillah branch, a new canal and headwater were excavated as well. The work was supervised by Willcocks and carried out by British engineering contractor John Jackson. The barrage is over 250 m long and has 36 openings that are each 5 m wide. It includes a lock for the passage of boats. The dam was upgraded in 1927. After the completion of the Hindiya Barrage, the remains of the old Ottoman dam were left in place, even though they inhibited ships <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> further <b>upstream,</b> because it was feared that the new barrage could not fulfill its function. Apart from supplying water to the Hillah branch, the Hindiyah Barrage also supplies two other canals that run parallel and {{on either side of the}} Hindiya branch and are called the Beni Hasan and Kifil.|$|R

2500|$|Multnomah 's engines {{were first}} tested in June 1851, and in August 1851 the vessel was {{taken on the}} first run upriver. [...] On this trip, Multnomah reached Cressman's Bar, a point about [...] downriver from Salem, Oregon. [...] At Cressman's, the water was so shallow that even Multnomah, which needed only 18inches to run in, could only cross the bar with difficulty. [...] Multnomah was able <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> [...] further <b>upstream</b> <b>to</b> Matheny's landing, (now {{the site of the}} Wheatland Ferry where the water was so shallow that no passage was possible.

[...] Multnomah was able to work further upriver from Salem, reaching the mouth of Rickreall Creek, according to Mills. [...] Historian Corning states that Multnomah went even further that fall, and became the first steamboat to reach Corvallis, then known as Marysville.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Energy {{evaluation}} of buildings service life {{is important to}} individualize strategies for energy saving and environmental impacts decreasing: the role of passivhaus {{from this point of}} view is obvious. Besides to evaluate eco-efficiency we should not be concentrated alone on building’s life, but goes stretched <b>to</b> all the <b>proceeded</b> <b>upstream</b> and downstream. <b>To</b> show these, it is stretched out a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) articulated in two moments: {{evaluation of}} environmental impacts from the production of insulating materials and evaluation of environmental impacts from energy consumption of a building, in Mediterranean context. Different stratifications of envelope (from high insulation to low insulation) were compared with the energy consumptions in service life (for heating), emphasizing from a side environmental advantages obtained from energy saving (for better performance in thermal insulation of high insulated envelope) and from the other side environmental impacts of the production’s phase. Results emphasize the role of thermal insulation for energy saving and the reduction of environmental impacts (building’s use phase produces more environmental impacts than material production phase). However, the use of high thicknesses of insulating material (like Passivhaus standard) in Mediterranean climate doesn’t reduce in significant way consumptions in use phase and therefore increases the impacts in production phase...|$|R
5000|$|The Yangtze Patrol, {{also known}} as the Yangtze River Patrol Force and Yangtze River Patrol or YangPat and ComYangPat, from 1854-1949, was a {{prolonged}} naval operation to protect American interests in the Yangtze River's treaty ports. Initially the patrol was carried out by ships of the United States Navy's East India and Asiatic Squadrons. In 1922, the [...] "YangPat", an abbreviated shortening of Yangtze Patrol, was established as a formal component and assigned to the Asiatic Fleet. Under the unequal treaties, the United States, Japan, and various European powers, especially the United Kingdom, who had been on the Yangtze, since 1897, were allowed to cruise China's rivers. They also, patrolled coastal waters, protecting U.S. citizens, their property, and Christian missionaries. The Yangtze is China's longest river, and very important for commerce. Ocean-going vessels were able <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> as far <b>upstream</b> as the city of Wuhan. This squadron-sized unit cruised the waters of the Yangtze as far inland as Chungking, more than 1300 mi from the sea, and occasionally far beyond.|$|R
