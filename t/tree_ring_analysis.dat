One {{of the most prominent}} discoveries was that of San Gabriel de Yunge, the first Spanish Capital of New Mexico, which dated from 1600, found near San Juan Pueblo. Her work on dendrochronology helped provides a baseline for southwestern chronologies and her work constituted a technical expertise which is still largely in demand. Hawley also conducted dendrochronological research in eastern North America, conducting some of the first such work in the region. She began her tree-ring research in the Midwest around the 1933 - 1934 academic year. She collected tree - ring specimens or inspected samples of archaeological wood from the University of Chicago’s excavations in southern Illinois. In 1937, she continued her Midwestern dendrochronological fieldwork and collected 1000 living-tree specimens in eight different states in an effort to identify the climate signal recorded by trees across the Midwest. In 1941, Hawley published Tree-Ring Analysis and Dating in the Mississippi Drainage where she presented the major problems she and her team faced: they were working with new species, they were working across a huge area, there was a shortage in old growth timber because of the extensive tree cutting, and the wood was not preserved well because of the damp mound sediments.|$|E

40|$|To {{overcome}} the relative dearth of paleoclimate records in Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, new methods {{are being developed}} in Australasia to exploit the potential of <b>tree</b> <b>rings</b> across the region. The Australasian region is potentially highly sensitive to climate change, including abrupt transitions caused by the crossing of thresholds within different components of the climate system (Fig. 1). Accurate reconstructions of the past behavior of the climate system are needed {{to better understand the}} mechanisms, and to validate projections of future change at the junction between tropical and polar regions (PAGES 2 k Consortium 2013). Tree-rings are critical in this regard. Over the 20 th century, dendroclimatic research in the Northern Hemisphere has advanced in leaps and bounds. In the Southern Hemisphere the much smaller land mass and less amenable tree species have limited the development of long proxy climate records from trees. However, during the past five years, significant technical advances and discoveries have created an exciting set of opportunities for increasing the quality and understanding of tree-ring-based climate reconstructions in the Australasian region and, potentially, other tree-bearing regions of the world. <b>Tree</b> <b>ring</b> growth <b>analysis</b> Like most proxy-climate reconstructions, those from <b>tree</b> <b>rings</b> are developed from statistical models relating observed climate data to measured tree-specific features such as ring widths. While these models are typically based on the correlation between two variables, causation is inferred from detailed understanding of the physiological mechanisms that drive tree growth and tree-ring formation. Recent technological and analytical advances have created the potential to monitor radial growth and wood cell formation at sub–hourly resolution over multiple years (Drew and Downes 2009).

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{the utility of}} <b>tree</b> <b>ring</b> radiocarbon <b>analysis</b> to quantify a temporal record of recently-added fossil fuel-derived carbon dioxide (CO₂ff) in the urban atmosphere, to retrospectively measure emissions and potentially validate local emissions inventories. Currently, there is no internationally recognised method to test emissions inventories against direct atmospheric estimations of CO₂ff. With the increasing interest in emissions control legislation, independent and objective research to validate emissions reported by governments and industries is needed. As CO₂ff emissions are completely depleted in radiocarbon (¹⁴C), an observed decrease in the ¹⁴C content of the atmosphere is mostly due to additions of CO₂ff. As trees incorporate CO₂ from the local atmosphere into annual growth rings, it was hypothesised that an urban located tree would reflect emission rates of its local surroundings. Measurements of the ¹⁴C content of cellulose were made from the annual <b>tree</b> <b>rings</b> of a Kauri tree (Agathis australis), located {{in the downtown area}} of the Wellington suburb of Lower Hutt (KNG 52). This record was compared with <b>tree</b> <b>rings</b> from two Kauri at a nearby coastal site (NIK 19 and NIK 23) and the long-term clean air ¹⁴CO₂ record from Baring Head. The clean air Kauri trees, NIK 19 and NIK 23, demonstrated excellent agreement with the Baring Head atmospheric record, indicating that the trees were accurately sampling the atmosphere. The KNG 52 tree, demonstrated good agreement with the clean air record {{in the early part of}} the record (with some variability), however, exhibited significantly lower Δ¹⁴CO₂ values from the 1980 s onward. Calculation of the influence of the terrestrial biosphere on the ¹⁴CO₂ record showed very little impact, determining that the variability seen was due to local additions of CO₂ff. Historic CO₂ff emissions were calculated using the Δ¹⁴CO₂ measurements from the KNG 52 ¹⁴CO₂ record for the period 1972 – 2012. Biosphere correction calculations showed that the biosphere was the dominant influence on the record in the early part of the record (1972 – 1980), with fossil fuel emissions dominating the record from 1980 s onward. The observations were compared qualitatively with meteorological data and urban development in the area to assess variability in CO₂ff. A minor trend towards lower wind speeds associated with higher levels of CO₂ff was identified, indicating that local meteorology may be responsible for 10 % change seen in the record. The influence of local development demonstrated some possible relation but a correlation was not significant. The KNG 52 CO₂ff record was compared with national-level reported liquid (road traffic) emissions from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC).

While Gladwin consistently sought out information that prescribed to his own view of dendrochronology, to this day, he is seen as somewhat of a novice on the topic. Nonetheless, in his publications, Gladwin takes a careful consideration of the methods employed by him and others, as to bring special attention to the critical thinking that one must undertake as an archaeologist. One of Gladwin’s most famous publications was Men out of Asia. In this novel-like publication, Gladwin describes his view on anthropology, and proposes a theory on the origins of peoples in the Americas, as a result of “multitudinous migrations.” This book is filled with cartoon-like representations of what Gladwin thought the first occupants of North America and their descendants looked like.
