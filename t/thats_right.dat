40|$|This paper uses Conversation Analysis {{to examine}} how a person with aphasia {{employed}} the response <b>that's</b> <b>right.</b> It discusses four functional variants of <b>that's</b> <b>right</b> (confirming; mutual stance; restored intersubjectivity; recognition), and composite turns involving <b>that's</b> <b>right.</b> A core collection of 100 turns was assembled and analysed. It is argued that the confirming <b>that's</b> <b>right</b> and the mutual stance <b>that's</b> <b>right</b> are both involved with agreement, and work to ratify the design and action of a prior turn. The former embraces epistemic authority, and the latter claims epistemic rights. The restored intersubjectivity <b>that's</b> <b>right</b> closes a period of trouble, while the recognition <b>that's</b> <b>right</b> claims knowledge of the matters addressed by a prior turn. Subsequent analyses demonstrate that positioning response tokens before <b>that's</b> <b>right</b> can point towards the constraints imposed by prior talk. Positioning of tokens after <b>that's</b> <b>right</b> can be involved with action projection. This paper adds new information about the epistemic and actional claims that can be implemented with <b>that's</b> <b>right,</b> and argues <b>that</b> a clinical focus on agreement may help enhance the everyday lives of people with aphasia. 18 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Cue: Is Africa?s climate changing? Is it {{becoming}} hotter and drier as {{a result}} of global warming? For many years scientists have been uncertain about exactly what climate change will mean for Africa, and this may be one reason why many governments have been slow to respond to the threat. However, in recent years one feature of our changing weather patterns has become more clear - extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods are becoming more common. Could this greater certainty about how our climate is changing lead to a more active response from governments and individuals? One person who thinks it might is Declan Conway, a climate expert who has spent the last ten years studying weather patterns in Africa. He recently spoke to Mike Davison about how he thinks attitudes towards climate change could themselves be changing. IN:		?In the past what we? OUT:		?climate change in the future. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 39 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Declan Conway, a climate expert based at the University of East Anglia in the UK. Transcript Conway	In the past what we tended to look at were emissions of greenhouse gases, which are causing the problems of climate change. So carbon dioxide, burning of trees, burning of fossil fuels, oil, gas and so on. But gradually as people have begun to realise that we are now committed to a certain amount of climate change, however much we change the present day emissions of greenhouse gases, we therefore need to think about adaptation. How is it that we can deal with these. How can individuals improve their capacity to manage extremes and variability, and what can the government do about intervening in those sort of events. Davison	And what kind of things would you be recommending, say in response to floods? Conway	Well for floods, for example, we know that often we get a chance to forecast that a flood is going to occur. As conditions get gradually wetter and wetter, and the land begins to become saturated, we can say that there may well be a flood event in the next few days, and some people may be exposed to lake-side flooding, or the river bursting its banks, and either their fields being affected, or their homes, or their animals being affected by that. So if we can improve the ability to be able to warn people about those kinds of events, then {{that would be a good}} first step. Davison	And imagine that you are able to warn people, crop farmers, livestock farmers; what can they do if they know a flood is coming? Conway	Well some of the things that could be done for example; a lot of flood events are caused by very heavy rainfall. Now if that occurs during the harvest season, farmers could be told or suggested that they harvest their crops early, before the rain comes. Or people who live in flood plains, areas that are likely to be flooded by rivers, could be warned about the hazard, so that they can then move temporarily out of the way, or move their animals. Davison	So it is actually very useful and practical information to know when a flood is coming? Conway	<b>That?s</b> <b>right,</b> it is. Davison	In terms of the future, do you think that there are things that are going to be happening over the next ten years, say, that are going to make it easier for people to respond to climate change? Conway	I think gradually as governments, as institutions and as people get more used to the idea that climate is actually less reliable than it used to be in the past - so of course, for most of the last century we have accepted that the climate doesn?t really change very much from year to year. But now when you speak to people, farmers, managers of reservoirs, dams and so on, we are beginning to see that more and more people are saying, ?Well, things seem to be a little bit different to us?. And I think that as that realisation becomes more accepted, then governments, people can begin to plan for more variability in the future, and that is very likely the thing that climate change is going to bring in the future, and that is less certainty about when the rains may come, how long the rains may last, or whether there may be any breaks in the rain, that kind of information. Davison	So you think that the forecasting, the predicting of when a rainy season is likely to start, could actually be the kind of information that could be spread to farmers, to help them with making decisions about what to grow and, when to grow it? Conway	<b>That?s</b> <b>right,</b> there certainly is a lot of interest in this area; the ability to use seasonal forecasting information. So that is like the weather forecasts we hear on the news about what is going to happen today or tomorrow, what the temperatures will be, whether it is going to rain. We are now developing an ability to be able to say, over the next two or three months, we are likely to see a very wet rainy season, so more rain than usual, or perhaps the rainy season may be quite dry. And that information, given the ability of farmers to be able to adapt to or act on that information, may actually be quite useful. It could also be useful for reservoir management; so how much water do we release from the reservoir this week, next week and so on, in the light of the seasonal forecast. So it is still in the early phase of development, but it is potentially a good strategy for dealing with climate change in the future. End of track.

40|$|Satellite {{tracking}} of livestock Cue: For pastoralist communities, livestock {{are like a}} bank account ? the assets on which the community depends. But keeping a careful watch on livestock is not always easy. Many cattle herders brand their animals to leave a permanent, identifying mark on their skin. However, increasingly there are demands for cattle owners to have much more detailed information about their animals, especially {{if they wish to}} sell to foreign markets. In Botswana and Kenya a new technology is currently being tested that aims to provide herders with this detailed information they need. A pilot project, being implemented by a Kenya-based organisation called ERMIS (Environment Research Mapping and Information Systems in Africa), uses small computer chips which are swallowed by the cattle, and which act as an electronic identification system. Linked to satellite-based global positioning systems (GPS), the computer chips are able to keep a record of the animal?s movements. Julius Muchimi, Executive Director of ERMIS explained the benefits and some of the potential hazards of the new technology to Susanna Thorp. IN:		?The technology is actually being ? OUT:		? within the pastoral communities. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 43 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Julius Muchimi on a high tech approach to livestock identification and tracking, which could help to protect cattle and the grazing resources they depend on. Transcript Muchimi	The technology is actually being used in the livestock sector basically in terms of a livestock identification and also the trace back mechanism. And what is happening is that livestock are actually identified in terms of where they come from and then it also helps in terms of identifying how the animals move around pastoral areas and how they can also be traced back in case they are actually lost or in case they are stolen. So it is actually is able to have an identification number and it is also able to give information on where the animal is actually located or where it is at any specific time. Thorp	Now you mentioned the trace back system, this is actually for when you are exporting animals and the EU requirements now insist {{that you have to be}} able to know where that animal has come from and what it has been through in terms of treatments, <b>that?s</b> <b>right</b> isn?t it? Muchimi	Yes that is true because for the African countries to penetrate into the EU market then that is a requirement that the animal must be identified in terms of where it has come from and that is actually the key thing. In Botswana, we know Botswana is actually doing very well in the livestock market and in Kenya we are unable to penetrate the EU market but we are seeing that by taking that technology and using it within our livestock sector then we are going to have a niche within the European Market. So we are trying to advance the technology, one, to penetrate into the European Market and two, to be able to also retain and contain our livestock resources within our territories so that then we can bring down the issue of cattle rustling, stealing cattle within the country and also across the borders to other countries. So we want to retain our assets and we want to get our market niche. Thorp	What about with actually managing pastoral rangelands, I mean is there the potential to sort of see how the pastoralists are using the land and help them make the most so that they are not contributing to degradation issues? Muchimi	The technology is actually quite important in terms of resource allocation because you can know the number of animals that are within a given region, and you can actually be able to have a kind of a regional appropriation of pastoral resources like the grazing resources, where water is and also where pasture is. So you can actually be able to apportion, so that you have sustainable use of natural resources. So it is actually a technology that - well used - then it can also bring a lot of sustainability. And I think actually that is the strength in that you can allocate resources in an equitable way. Thorp	So it sounds like it could be quite successful but what challenges are there in using this technology? Muchimi	One is the issue of the cost. We have to really think is it really affordable by the community? The other thing is that can the community also be able to now take the technology further by using GPS and using the GIS software because the technology is actually moving. The question is, is it an appropriate technology that the community can use without external assistance? So the issue is actually sustainability of the technology. Thorp	But what about the information that is generated and who owns that information? I mean if you are using these very modern technologies and you are using a computer chip and you are linking it in with GPS, then there is the potential for other people to take that information and use it for other means? Muchimi	Yes that is actually a problem. If you look at the technology, it was invented for military purposes, monitoring your enemies or even remotely monitoring resources that are outside your territory. So when you bring this technology then you give your enemy a chance of knowing exactly where your assets are, where your animals are, and if they want to track it, it is actually very clear. They can actually use GIS and other systems to monitor actually where you are migrating to, where you are grazing your animals and also where you are also possibly going to sell. So they can intercept you. So it is a technology that needs a lot of care and we have to look at actually, are the communities secure by using this technology because it exposes them, it makes them vulnerable. Thorp	So, some good advantages, but some disadvantages that have to be taken into consideration. Do you see it as something that will be taken up more widespreadly? Muchimi	Yes because the benefits are more than even the threats. Many communities we would like to move forward because it is securing their livestock and it is also securing the environment, meaning the sustainability of the whole livestock production system within the pastoral communities.
