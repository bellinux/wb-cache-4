5|$|Leonardo's The Battle of Anghiara was a fresco {{commissioned}} in 1505 for the Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred) in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. Its central scene depicted {{four men}} riding raging war horses {{engaged in a}} battle for possession of a standard, at the Battle of Anghiari in 1440. At the same time his rival Michelangelo, who had just finished his David, was assigned <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall.</b> All that remains of Leonardo's work is a copy by Rubens, but Maurizio Seracini is convinced it can still be found and has spent a lifetime searching for it. He was allowed to drill some pilot holes in a mural in the Salone dei Cinquecento, Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, and his team did find evidence of an oil painting underneath.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} entered through the porch {{to the west}} end of the south wall of the nave, which leads to an arched doorway. There are two 18th-century slate plaques on the walls by the south door commemorating those who made {{donations}} to the poor of the parish; one has names from 1761, the other from 1766. On <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall,</b> a 17th-century slate plaque commemorates Hugh ap Richard Lewis and his wife Jane (died 1660 and 1661 respectively). The internal timbers of the roof, some of which are old, are exposed, but there is a decorated panelled barrel-vaulted ceiling above the sanctuary at the east end of the church. The transept roof is largely 17th-century.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to move city and county {{government}} functions {{out of the state}} capitol, the city purchased a plot of land to build on in 1832. They chose a spot on the edge of De Witt's public square, along Eagle Street at the eastern terminus of Lion Street (later renamed Washington Avenue); the land was bought from St. Peter's Church for $10,295.95 ($ in modern dollars). The design of the new city hall was done by Albany architect Philip Hooker. The cornerstone was laid by Mayor John Townsend amid a Masonic ceremony, however the date of this event is in dispute. The building was completed in 1832 {{at a cost of about}} $92,000 ($ in modern dollars). The new city hall was a Greek Revival structure, built of white marble with an entrance porch supported by four Doric columns. On the roof was a gilded dome. The interior was simple, with little ornamentation, though a full-length statue of Alexander Hamilton stood in the center of the upper hall, between the Court room and the Common Council Chamber. Upon one side of this hall was a bas-relief of DeWitt Clinton, with a view of a primitive canal-boat in the distance, and on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall</b> was a similar figure of Sir Walter Scott. The building was destroyed by fire on February 10, 1880. Plans for a replacement city hall quickly developed.|$|E

The sefarim (Torah scrolls) are usually wrapped in a very wide mantle, quite {{different}} from the cylindrical mantles used by most Ashkenazi Jews. Tikim, wooden or metal cylinders around the sefarim, are typically not used. These were reportedly used, however, by the Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg.|$|E

25|$|The cathedral's south {{transept}} houses an 18-metre astronomical clock, one of {{the largest}} in the world. Its first forerunner was the so-called Dreikönigsuhr ("three-king clock") of 1352-1354, located at <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall</b> from where today's clock is. Then starting in 1547 a new clock was built by Christian Herlin, and others, but the construction was interrupted when the cathedral was handed over to the Roman Catholic Church. Construction was resumed in 1571 by Conrad Dasypodius and the Habrecht brothers, and this clock was astronomically much more involved. It also had paintings by the Swiss painter Tobias Stimmer. That clock functioned into the late 18th Century and can be seen today in the Strasbourg Museum of Decorative Arts.|$|E
40|$|Projet M 3 NThe laminar {{steady flow}} is {{computed}} in a rigid pipe with wall configuration corresponding {{to a highly}} collapsed flexible tube conveying a critical flow (Reynolds number of 1210) to investigate the three-dimensional flow characteristics, especially in the distal segment. The tube shape, in both axial and transverse planes, is designed from ultra-sound measurements performed on the actual Starling resistor. <b>The</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>walls</b> in <b>the</b> distal tube segment come into contact; the tube then diverges to reach a circular uniform exit segment. The Navier-Stokes equations, associated to the classical boundary conditions, were solved by a finite element method (P 1  - P 1  bubble element). Where <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>walls</b> are into contact, the fluid flows through two small drop-shaped outer passages.

30|$|The 1990 Hines Creek {{landslide}} {{occurred on}} <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> valley <b>wall</b> {{of a much}} larger landslide. This larger landslide predates the earliest provincial aerial photographic coverage of the site, in 1952. Lu et al. (1998) speculate that the pre- 1952 landslide was a major contributing factor to the occurrence of the 1990 landslide, as it directed the stream into <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> valley <b>wall,</b> causing undercutting of the slope. They estimated the volume of the pre- 1952 landslide to be 48 Mm 3. An extensive sedimentary deposit formed upriver of the pre- 1952 landslide, which persisted until at least 1988 (Alberta air photo AS 3729 – 88).|$|R
25|$|Initially, the mizrah wall in synagogues was on {{the side}} of the {{entrance}}. However, the remains of the Dura-Europos synagogue on the Euphrates reveal that by the 3rd century C.E. the doors were on the eastern side and <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall,</b> in which a special niche had been made to place the scrolls during worship, faced Jerusalem. In Eretz Israel, the wall facing the Temple site was changed from the side of the entrance to the side of the Ark in the 5th or 6th century. This change is found in synagogues at Naaran, near Jericho, and Beit Alfa. Worshipers came through the portals and immediately faced both the scrolls and Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|Beyond the Great Hall is {{the dining}} room for the courtiers in {{attendance}} (the Courtiers-in-Attendance Dining Room). The room was designed by Rastrelli in the mid-18th century. The small room is lit by four windows which look out into the formal courtyard. The architect placed false windows with mirrors and mirrored glass on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall,</b> making the hall more spacious and bright. Decorated in the typical baroque interior style, the hall is filled with gilded wall-carvings, complex gilded pieces on the doors, and ornamental patterns of stylized flowers. The ceiling mural was painted by a well-known student of the Russian School from the mid-18th century. It {{is based on the}} Greek myth of the sun god Helios and the goddess of the dawn, Eos.|$|E

25|$|The {{appearance}} of the Tent Room is drawn from the original use of striped fabric draped {{on the walls and}} hung in swaths from the ceiling in order to temporarily transform what was normally the tennis court into a dining hall. The room today has a wall covering of vertically sriped red and gold fabric with a padded backing, which rises to meet the same fabric hung in a swag fashion outwards from a single coffer in the centre of the ceiling and trimmed {{around the perimeter of the}} room with a scallop edged valence of simple passementerie and tassels. This gives the space an overall resemblance to the interior of a large tent. The west wall of the room is broken by series of windows, each paired with a double door into the Long Gallery on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall,</b> and between them a continuous frame and panel wainscotting. All this woodwork, including the door frames and other trim, is painted in a gloss white to contrast with the textured and patterned wall fabric.|$|E
25|$|One of his {{greatest}} works from this period {{is a series of}} murals in the Ocean Springs Community House. Along one wall, he painted the landing in Ocean Springs of the 17th-century French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville. Along <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall</b> he painted what he called the “Seven Climates,” in the sense of “a belt of the earth’s surface contained between two given parallels of latitude.” The Gulf Coast—Ocean Springs in particular - is seen as a microcosm of these climates, each of which Anderson associates with a corresponding celestial body and with a season of the year: Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon, beginning with Mercury and ending with Uranus. Anderson must also have been aware of the doctrine that the seven planetary spheres, with their different tones, produce a celestial music. Another, smaller mural, painted around the same time but discovered only after his death on the wooden walls of a padlocked room in his cottage at Shearwater, is inspired by Psalm 104. It is a radiant hymn to light and to the beauty of one day on the Coast, beginning on the east wall with sunrise and continuing around the room through noon, sunset and night. Both murals may be seen at the 'Walter Anderson Museum of Art.|$|E
25|$|Directly west {{of these}} rooms is the Edwardian Mappin Wing, which {{contains}} the entrance hall. Its walls are partly panelled, partly clad in marble; the lower floor covered in mosaic tile {{and the upper}} with wood. The two levels are connected by a wide, white marble, central stair; to each side, at the upper landing, are marble guards with ornate, Neoclassical balustrades. Across {{from the top of}} the stair is a door (to the reception room) flanked with wood panels documenting the names and escutcheons of each of the governors general for New France, British North America, and Canada. On <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall,</b> to the left of the entrance, is the Royal Window—a stained glass piece commemorating the 40th anniversary of the accession of Elizabeth II to the throne, displaying, between the Queen's Canadian royal standard above and the Great Seal of Canada below, the monarch's coat of arms for Canada surrounded by the shields of each of the provincial coats of arms. Additionally, in the top two corners are images of Elizabeth's royal cypher, balancing out representations of the Sovereign's badges for both the Order of Canada and the Order of Military Merit in the bottom two corners. Another stained glass window is found to the right of the entrance, marking the first appointment of a Canadian-born governor general; the viceregal position is symbolised by a crowned lion holding a maple leaf and surrounded by the shields of the arms of the first seven persons to hold the post. In 2012, bronze and glass handrails, funded by a private donation from Rouge Herald Extraordinary Roger Alexander Lindsay, were added to each side of the stair in commemoration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E

500|$|Men from CCC Camp S-88-Pa, {{based at}} nearby Lyman Run in Potter County, were also {{active in the}} park. In 1939, they built a {{structure}} at Cherry Springs which is [...] "the largest and most unique of the CCC-built picnic pavilions" [...] in the state, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The pavilion overlooks PA Route 44and is shaped like an H, with two partially enclosed structures (the vertical lines of the H) connected by a breezeway (the horizontal bar). The breezeway is a roof supported by eight log columns with log railings. The ends of the pavilion are built from log walls with white chinking, like log cabins. Each end has a large opening to the breezeway in one wall, while the other three sides are fully enclosed with a large window in the wall facing the highway, a stone fireplace and chimney on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall,</b> and a door flanked by windows on the wall opposite the breezeway.|$|E

It has five ogee-headed lights separated by vertical tracery, and measures [...] at its widest point by [...] at its tallest. Unlike most of the other windows in the church, it contains coloured glass. A smaller window in the north wall also dates from this time, and has a square frame containing two lights; a matching window was added in the 19th century in <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>wall.</b> The other windows in the church are from the 19th century in various designs. One window, in the north wall of the nave, has had stained glass added as a memorial to two local residents who died in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Characteristic of {{the country}} are the {{enormous}} fissures which divide it, formed over time by the erosive action of water.
