Prior to Amtrak, the route was known as the Duquesne, named after Fort Duquesne in Pittsburgh, and operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad.

5|$|Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are {{commonly}} cited {{as an example}} of a keystone species; because, they limit the density of sea urchins that feed on kelp. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear, and this has a dramatic effect on community structure. Hunting of sea otters, for example, is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas). While <b>the</b> <b>keystone</b> species concept has been used extensively as a conservation tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that keystone species may not be common, so it is unclear how generally <b>the</b> <b>keystone</b> species model can be applied.|$|E

5|$|Zahorchak {{spearheaded the}} {{establishment}} of <b>the</b> <b>Keystone</b> Exams, state-created math, science and social studies tests that high school students {{would be required to}} pass a majority of in order to graduate. The measure was met with criticism by the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and others who felt the plan would be expensive and would undermine local school boards' authority to set graduation requirements. The PSBA agreed to support <b>the</b> <b>Keystone</b> Exams under a compromise that schools might not have to give the tests if their own final exams are rigorous enough. <b>The</b> <b>Keystone</b> Exams were approved in 2009 and will first take effect starting with the class of 2015. Zahorchak also established the state's Standards Aligned System, which created a standardized set of diagnostic tests and curriculum guides for local school districts. The standards were aligned to six components: a curriculum framework, assessment systems, best teaching practices, emotional support practices, proven research resources and best interventions for accommodations for children who struggle. Within two years, most public school districts within Pennsylvania were using Standards Aligned System in some form.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{construction}} of an embankment at nearby Bainbridge Street, the Pennsylvania Railroad was forced to build a new station at West High Street in 1900. After 15years, the Pennsylvania replaced the station. The new station was constructed out of Indiana Limestone in a similar style to the nearby Masonic Homes built by the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. On July4, 1915, the Liberty Bell made a stop at the station while being transported to the PanamaPacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California. The Pennsylvania began electrifying its line between Philadelphia and Harrisburg in 1937, a task which was completed on January15, 1938. In 1977, the deteriorating station building was closed. Prior to the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>Keystone</b> Service in 1981, the Elizabethtown station was served by the Big Apple, the Silverliner Service, and <b>the</b> <b>Keystone.</b> From 1991 to 1995, the Atlantic City Express served the station on weekends.

5|$|The adult jaguar is an apex predator, {{meaning it}} exists {{at the top}} of its food chain and is not preyed on in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a {{keystone}} species, as it is assumed, through controlling the population levels of prey such as herbivorous and granivorous mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems. However, accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while controlling for the effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases in the absence of <b>the</b> <b>keystone</b> predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects. However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>keystone</b> predator hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.|$|E

50|$|Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>Keystones,</b> {{and every}} other amateur team in Pittsburgh, began playing all of their games on the new ice rink at the Duquesne Gardens. The Gardens, because of its {{artificial}} ice surface, lured many established hockey players to the Pittsburgh-area from Canada. In 1901 the team became members of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League, with the Pittsburgh Bankers and Pittsburgh Athletic Club. Aside from league play, the teams also played exhibition games {{against some of the}} best amateur teams from North America. During the 1901-02 season, Riley Hern, a future member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, began his professional career with <b>the</b> <b>Keystones.</b> In his first season, Hern led the league in victories, with nine in 14 games and was named to the WPHL All-Star Team.

5|$|The {{discontinuance}} of the Atlantic City Express in 1995, and {{the arrival}} of the California Cars in 1996 and the Surfliner railcars in 2000–2002, lessened the need for the Metroliner-based cab cars. However, the Vermonter corridor service began using them when a reverse move was added between Springfield, Massachusetts and Palmer, Massachusetts in 1995. The later cab cars, and some of the earlier conversions, were retired in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2007, six of the 9600-series cab cars were brought out of retirement to support additional frequencies on the newly re-electrified Keystone Service. After the Vermonters backup move was eliminated in 2014, the ex-Metroliner cab cars have been used primarily on <b>the</b> <b>Keystone</b> Service and New Haven–Springfield Shuttle.|$|E
