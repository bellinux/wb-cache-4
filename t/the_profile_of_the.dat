5|$|An {{important}} reason for this ambition is growing international concern about human-induced climate change. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's proposal that carbon dioxide emissions should be reduced by 60% was incorporated into the UK government's 2003 Energy White Paper. The 2006 Stern Review proposed a 55% reduction by 2030. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report has further increased <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issue.|$|E

5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. <b>The</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machined surface is always the inverse of <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} trail a {{particular}} bike has may vary with time for several reasons. On bikes with front suspension, especially telescopic forks, compressing the front suspension, due to heavy braking for example, can steepen the steering axis angle and reduce trail. Trail also varies with lean angle, and steering angle, usually decreasing from a maximum when the bike is straight upright and steered straight ahead. Trail can decrease to zero with sufficiently large lean and steer angles, which can alter how stable a bike feels. Finally, even <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front tire can influence how trail varies as the bike is leaned and steered.|$|E

5|$|Central Coast Mariners' {{bid for a}} {{franchise}} in the Football Federation Australia's new A-League competition was aimed at filling the one spot for a regional team that was designated by the FFA. Media speculation prior to {{the announcement of the}} franchises in the new league suggested that the Mariners' bid may be favourable due to its new blood. Backing from former Australian international player and club technical director Alex Tobin, as well as Clean Up Australia personality Ian Kiernan—who would act as inaugural club chairman—also strengthened its proposal. As the only regional bidder, Central Coast was expected to make it into the league by default. Following a reported signed deal with the FFA, the club signed former Northern Spirit coach Lawrie McKinna as manager and Ian Ferguson, a former Rangers and Northern Spirit player, as coach. To aid the FFA's goals of building <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sport, the Mariners created formal links with local state league team Central Coast United. On 1 November 2004, after much expectation, the club was announced as one of eight teams to become part of FFA's domestic competition, the A-League. The decision made Central Coast Mariners the first Gosford-based professional sports team to play in a national competition.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta's {{imprisonment}} transformed {{him into}} a political martyr for many Kenyans, further enhancing his status. A Luo anti-colonial activist, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, {{was the first to}} publicly call for Kenyatta's release, an issue that gained growing support among Kenya's anti-colonialists. In 1955, the British writer Montagu Slater—a socialist sympathetic to Kenyatta's plight—released The Trial of Jomo Kenyatta, a book which raised <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case. By the late 1950s, the imprisoned Kenyatta had become a symbol of African nationalism across the continent. Calls for his release were being made outside Kenya: resolutions to that effect were produced at the All-African Peoples' Conferences held in Tunis in 1960 and Cairo in 1961. Tanganyikan President Julius Nyerere also did so. Activists in the Kenyan Asian community also backed him, with the Kenya Indian Congress calling for his release. In April 1959, Kenyatta was released from Lokitaung. The administration then placed a restricting order on Kenyatta, forcing him to reside in the remote area of Lodwar, where he had to report to the district commissioner twice a day. There, he was joined by his wife Ngina. In October 1961 she bore him another son, Uhuru, and later on another daughter, Nyokabi, and a further son, Muhoho. Kenyatta spent two years in Lodwar.|$|E

Mamia was an umpire and an umpire examiner for the Oceania region. She attended South Pacific Games in Micronesia, the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia, and the Olympic Games in Sydney. Mamia was a national representative for teams that had competed in the South Pacific Games during the 1980s. Tina Pupuke Browne was president of the Cook Islands Netball Association.

5|$|One of {{the most}} infamous {{incidents}} in tournament history occurred in 1987 in Piestany, Czechoslovakia, where a massive brawl involving all players on both teams occurred between Canada and the Soviet Union. It began when Pavel Kostichkin took a two-handed slash at Theoren Fleury and the Soviet Union's Evgeny Davydov came off the bench, eventually leading {{to most of the}} players from both teams joining the brawl. The officials, unable to break up the fight, walked off the ice and eventually tried shutting off the arena lights, but the brawl lasted for 20 minutes before the game was declared null and void. An emergency IIHF meeting resulted in the delegates voting 7–1 to disqualify both teams from the tournament. While the Soviets were out of medal contention, Canada was playing for the gold medal, and were leading 4–2 {{at the time of the}} brawl. The gold medal ultimately went to Finland, hosts Czechoslovakia took the silver and Sweden, who had been eliminated from medal contention, was awarded the bronze. The IIHF voted to suspend all players involved from competing in international events for 18 months, and all coaches for three years. Player suspensions were later cut to six months, which allowed eligible players such as Fleury to participate in the 1988 tournament. The brawl helped raise <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tournament in Canada, where the tournament now ranks as one {{of the most}} important hockey events.|$|E
5|$|The Winter Games {{have evolved}} since their inception. Sports and {{disciplines}} {{have been added}} and some of them, such as Alpine skiing, luge, short track speed skating, freestyle skiing, skeleton, and snowboarding, have earned a permanent spot on the Olympic programme. Some others, including curling and bobsleigh, have been discontinued and later reintroduced; others have been permanently discontinued, such as military patrol, though the modern Winter Olympic sport of biathlon is descended from it. Still others, such as speed skiing, bandy and skijoring, were demonstration sports but never incorporated as Olympic sports. The rise of television as a global medium for communication enhanced <b>the</b> <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Games. It generated income via the sale of broadcast rights and advertising, which has become lucrative for the IOC. This allowed outside interests, such as television companies and corporate sponsors, to exert influence. The IOC has had to address several criticisms, internal scandals, the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Winter Olympians, {{as well as a}} political boycott of the Winter Olympics. Nations have used the Winter Games to proclaim the superiority of their political systems.|$|E
