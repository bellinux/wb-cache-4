The sound of crickets is often used in media to emphasize silence, often for comic effect after an awkward joke, in a similar manner to tumbleweed.|$|E

Another delicacy of this region is the bamboo caterpillar, and the best rearing and harvesting techniques in semi-natural habitats are being studied.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike the design-heavy - if aesthetically {{appealing}} - Voco records, Cricket Records {{established a}} more uniform approach to design, employing decorated sleeves and consistent, if sometimes a little crowded, label copy featuring a logo with a cartoon <b>cricket.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Cricket</b> logo itself combined <b>the</b> cartoon <b>cricket</b> with a stylized blue record reading [...] "Cricket Records" [...] on 78 issues, {{but not so}} on <b>the</b> 45s. <b>The</b> <b>Cricket</b> went through several variants of which the most common was an image of <b>the</b> <b>cricket</b> pointing rightward with a rather demure expression. A later design shows <b>the</b> <b>Cricket</b> sitting atop <b>the</b> blue record from the 78 releases, staring upward, and <b>the</b> <b>cricket</b> also appears in various other contexts in sleeve designs.

25|$|Chinese cricket {{culture and}} cricket-related {{business}} is highly seasonal.

25|$|Crickets are {{a common}} subject of children's books on nature and advice on keeping pet crickets are plentiful. An ideal home habitat for a cricket is a large {{transparent}} jar or a small terrarium {{with at least two}} inches of damp soil on the bottom.

25|$|The {{short life}} span of a cricket necessitates {{frequent}} replacement of aging insects. <b>The</b> <b>crickets</b> sold in present-day China are usually caught in the wild in remote provinces. Earlier, most crickets sold in major cities {{were caught in the}} nearby countryside, but in the 21st century a local catch, or dichong, is extremely rare. The majority of crickets sold in Shanghai in the 1990s and the 2000s came from rural Ningjin County in Shandong, where cricket hunting became a second job for local peasants. Practically all people of Ningjin—men and women of all ages—engage in the cricket business. A peasant usually makes around 70 yuan per night, and 2000 yuan per season. A very good season can bring a family over 10,000 yuan ($1,210).|$|E
