5|$|No coins {{were issued}} {{with the name}} of Æthelred or Æthelflæd on them, but in the 910s silver pennies were minted in west Mercian <b>towns</b> <b>with</b> unusual {{ornamental}} designs on the reverse and this may have reflected Æthelflæd's desire to distinguish specie issued under her control from that of her brother. After her death, west Mercian coin reverses were again the same as those on coins produced in Wessex.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{the city}} walls, suburbs had sprung up {{providing}} {{homes for the}} craftsmen and tradespeople who flocked to the already overcrowded city. These were shanty <b>towns</b> <b>with</b> wooden shacks and no sanitation. The government had tried to control this development but had failed and {{over a quarter of}} a million people lived here. Other immigrants had taken over fine town houses, vacated by Royalists who had fled the country during the Commonwealth, converting them into tenements with different families in every room. These properties were soon vandalised and became rat-infested slums.|$|E

Bates remarks that finding a new species is only the start; he also describes animal behaviour, sometimes in detail, as for the army ants. He constantly relates the wildlife to the people, explaining how the people hunt, what they eat and what they use as medicines. The book is illustrated with drawings by leading artists including E.

Holden's town planning ideas involved the relocation of industry out of towns and cities to new industrial centres in the style of Port Sunlight or Bournville where workers could live close to their workplace. The new industrial centres would be linked to the existing <b>towns</b> <b>with</b> new fast roads and reconstruction in town centres would be planned to provide more open space around the administrative centres.|$|E
5|$|Bernstein {{states that}} Washington's lynching {{was a unique}} event because it {{occurred}} {{in a city with}} a reputation for progressiveness, but was attended by thousands of people who were excited by the brutal torture. Similar acts of mob violence typically occurred in smaller <b>towns</b> <b>with</b> fewer spectators. William Carrigan of Rowan University argues that the culture of central Texas had glorified retributive mob violence for decades before Washington's lynching, maintaining that this culture of violence explains how such a brutal attack could be publicly celebrated. Hale posits that Washington's death signaled a transition in the practice of lynching, demonstrating its acceptance in modernized, 20th-century cities. She notes that Washington's lynching illustrates how technological innovations, such as telephones and inexpensive photographs, could empower lynch mobs but also increase society's condemnation of their actions.|$|E
5|$|Following the conquest, many Anglo-Saxons, {{including}} {{groups of}} nobles, {{fled the country}} for Scotland, Ireland, or Scandinavia. Members of King Harold Godwinson's family sought refuge in Ireland and used their bases in that country for unsuccessful invasions of England. The largest single exodus occurred in the 1070s, {{when a group of}} Anglo-Saxons in a fleet of 235 ships sailed for the Byzantine Empire. The empire became a popular destination for many English nobles and soldiers, as the Byzantines were in need of mercenaries. The English became the predominant element in the elite Varangian Guard, until then a largely Scandinavian unit, from which the emperor's bodyguard was drawn. Some of the English migrants were settled in Byzantine frontier regions on the Black Sea coast, and established <b>towns</b> <b>with</b> names such as New London and New York.|$|E
