5|$|The poem was {{the first}} of Eliot's that relied on speech, with a narrator who speaks to the {{audience}} directly. Described as a poem of early summer, air, and grace, it begins with a narrator recalling a moment in a garden. The scene provokes a discussion on time and how the present, not the future or past, really matters to individuals. Memories connect the individual to the past, but the past cannot change. The poem then transitions from memory to how life works and the point of existence. In particular, the universe is described as orderly and that consciousness is not found within time even though humanity is bound by time. The scene of the poem moves from a garden to the London underground where technology dominates. Those who cling to technology and reason are unable to understand the universe or the Logos ("the Word", or Christ). The underworld is replaced by a churchyard and a discussion of death. This, in turn, becomes a discussion of <b>timelessness</b> and eternity, which ends the poem.|$|E
25|$|The English {{poet and}} author Siegfried Sassoon (1886–1967), who lived nearby at Heytesbury House, wrote about Scratchbury Camp on a June day in 1942, {{capturing}} the ambience of the Wiltshire Downs on a summer's day, whilst touching on the pervasive military presence of that {{age and the}} historical <b>timelessness</b> of the area.|$|E
25|$|Vermeer's {{mother-in-law}} Maria Thins owned Dirck van Baburen's 1622 oil-on-canvas The Procuress (or {{a copy of}} it), {{which appears}} {{in the background of}} two of Vermeer's paintings. The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a pearly light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic <b>timelessness</b> (e.g., Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window, Dresden, Gemäldegalerie). Vermeer's two townscapes have also been attributed to this period: View of Delft (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and A street in Delft (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).|$|E
25|$|Craig {{examines}} arguments {{aimed at}} showing either that God is timeless or omnitemporal. He defends the coherence of a timeless and personal being, but {{says that the}} arguments for divine <b>timelessness</b> are unsound or inconclusive. By contrast, he gives two {{arguments in favor of}} divine temporality. First, he says that if a temporal world exists, then in virtue of his real relations to that world, God cannot remain untouched by its temporality. Craig says that given God's changing relations with the world he must change at least extrinsically, which is sufficient for his existing temporally. Second, Craig says that if a temporal world exists, then in virtue of his omniscience, God must know tensed facts about the world, such as what is happening now, which Craig argues is sufficient for his being temporally located. Craig argues that, since a temporal world does exist, it follows that God exists in time.|$|E

Dhumavati's nama stotras (hymn with names of the deities) identify her with Parvati, Sati, and glorify her as a slayer of demons.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{reception of}} the films has been varied, but several are regarded as classic television ghost stories. Sarah Dempster, writing in The Guardian in 2005, noted that [...] "Perhaps the most surprising aspect ... is how little its adaptations ... have dated. They may boast the odd signifier of cheap 1970s telly – outlandish regional vowels, inappropriate eyeliner, a surfeit of depressed oboes – but lurking within their hushed cloisters and glum expanses of deserted coastline is a <b>timelessness</b> at odds with virtually everything written, or broadcast, before or since." ...|$|E
500|$|Per Bak Jensen (born 1949) {{seeks to}} capture <b>timelessness</b> or [...] "the being of places" [...] in his work. A pioneer of modern {{landscape}} photography, his topics are unusual: {{a field of}} corn stubble, thistles, or twigs lying in the snow. Much of his recent work includes photographs from Iceland and Greenland, some with stark images of minerals and rocks. While he is extremely attentive to angle, light and exposure, he never manipulates his photographs once they have been taken. He has successfully exhibited across Denmark {{for many years and}} more recently in New York, London and Paris.|$|E

"Symbolically, the ao dai invokes nostalgia and <b>timelessness</b> {{associated}} with a gendered image of the homeland for which many Vietnamese people throughout the diaspora yearn," [...] wrote Nhi T. Lieu, {{an assistant professor at}} the University of Texas at Austin. The difficulties of working while wearing an ao dai link the dress to frailty and innocence, she wrote. Vietnamese writers who favor the use of the ao dai as a school uniform cite the inconvenience of wearing it as an advantage, a way of teaching students feminine behavior such as modesty, caution, and a refined manner.|$|E
500|$|A Certain World: A Commonplace Book (1970) {{was a kind}} of self-portrait made up of {{favourite}} quotations with commentary, {{arranged in}} alphabetical order by subject. His last prose book was a selection of essays and reviews, Forewords and Afterwords (1973). His last books of verse, Epistle to a Godson (1972) and the unfinished Thank You, Fog (published posthumously, 1974) include reflective poems about language ("Natural Linguistics") and about his own ageing ("A New Year Greeting", [...] "Talking to Myself", [...] "A Lullaby" [...] ). His last completed poem was [...] "Archaeology", about ritual and <b>timelessness,</b> two recurring themes in his later years.|$|E
500|$|An Enta da Stage {{review on}} OhWord.com praises the {{production}} work, stating [...] "Though the album's success is largely attributable to Buckshot's performance, one cannot ignore the phenomenal production from the Beatminerz. They took the already dark sound of The Low End Theory and one-upped it, filtering out almost all treble and using spare, hardcore drum samples. The compositions of Mr. Walt and Evil Dee are also cleverly structured, propelling Buckshot's raps {{directly into the}} listener's psyche."..."The crackle of scratched vinyl pervades the album, contributing to the feel of warmth and <b>timelessness.</b> Thanks to the Beatminerz, there is something inviting about Enta da Stage, despite its confrontational lyrics." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} {{to shoot the}} film mainly {{in black and white}} contributed to the documentary style of cinematography, which cinematographer Janusz Kamiński compared to German Expressionism and Italian neorealism. Kamiński said that he wanted to give the impression of <b>timelessness</b> to the film, so the audience would [...] "not have a sense of when it was made." [...] Spielberg decided to use black and white to match the feel of actual documentary footage of the era. Universal chairman Tom Pollock asked him to shoot the film on a color negative, to allow color VHS copies of the film to later be sold, but Spielberg did not want to accidentally [...] "beautify events." ...|$|E
500|$|The minuet is the {{shortest}} among those of the Opus 50, but the trio features an exceptionally long second section, which uses drifting melodies, a fermata {{and a pair of}} two-measure pauses {{to create a sense of}} <b>timelessness.</b> Neither the minuet nor the trio reaches a proper conclusion, and in this they continue a feature of the first two movements. [...] The minuet ends with a perfunctory reprise of its main theme and the trio draws out its final cadence with a chromatic passage marked [...] "diminuendo". [...] Again, Haydn reinforces the interconnectedness between the movements with an explicit direction to the performers for an immediate segue from the reprised minuet to the finale.|$|E
500|$|LaborintusII is a {{recording}} of the 1965 composition {{of the same name}} by Luciano Berio, who wrote it for the 700thanniversary of Dante Alighieri's birth. The libretto was provided by Edoardo Sanguineti, who included elements of his 1956 poem Laborintus in it. AllMusic's Thom Jurek described the original poem as speaking of [...] "the <b>timelessness</b> of love and mourning, while acting as a critique of the commoditization of all things". In addition to Sanguineti's own poetry—itself based on themes found in Dante's Divina Commedia, Convivio and La Vita Nuova—the work uses excerpts from the Bible and the writings of poets T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Musically, LaborintusII incorporates elements of jazz and electronic music while sometimes evoking the style of Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi.|$|E
500|$|He {{has made}} sculptures of David Hume and Adam Smith, {{philosophers}} of the Scottish Enlightenment, which {{stand in the}} Royal Mile in Edinburgh. Hume is depicted in a [...] philosopher's toga, representing the <b>timelessness</b> of philosophical thought, a decision which was criticised as atavistic after the unveiling in 1996, though Stoddart remained stoic, [...] "So here I discovered that the right thing, done in public, will often earn one great disapproval: a lesson for life – in the modern age at least." [...] Local philosophy students soon began a tradition of rubbing the statue's toe to absorb some of his knowledge. Though Stoddart placed the foot {{over the edge of}} the plinth to encourage such engagement, the irony of the practice given Hume's critiques of superstition has been remarked upon.|$|E
500|$|The {{concert was}} termed [...] "a {{complete}} success" [...] by IGN, who commented that they [...] "walked away {{impressed with the}} performance, the presentation, and the <b>timelessness</b> of Uematsu's compositions". The response to the concert was greater than expected, with tickets selling out in three days. After [...] "many fans pleaded for another {{chance to see the}} concert", Dear Friends was expanded into a full concert tour the following year, conducted by Arnie Roth. Roth took on the role of conductor for the series after trying to get the show to be performed by his Chicago Pops orchestra, and hearing that other tour locations were hesitant about putting on the concert. He has said that he tried to add to the concerts his personal touch in the areas of [...] "drama and timing". Different orchestras were used in each performance, though the format and setlist remained the same.|$|E
500|$|For [...] "Saturn", Holst again used a previously-composed vocal piece, Dirge and Hymeneal, as {{the basis}} for the movement, where {{repeated}} chords represent the relentless approach of old age. [...] "Uranus", which follows, has elements of Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique and Dukas's The Sorcerer's Apprentice, in its depiction of the magician who [...] "disappears in a whiff of smoke as the sonic impetus of the movement diminishes from fff to ppp in the space of a few bars". [...] "Neptune", the final movement, concludes with a wordless female chorus gradually receding, an effect which Warrack likens to [...] "unresolved <b>timelessness...</b> never ending, since space does not end, but drifting away into eternal silence". Apart from his concession with [...] "I Vow to Thee..."', Holst insisted on the unity of the whole work, and opposed the performance of individual movements. Nevertheless, Imogen wrote that the piece had [...] "suffered from being quoted in snippets as background music".|$|E
500|$|Beyond {{the town}} the {{bridge over the}} river still exists and the river symbolizes time and <b>timelessness,</b> healing and the natural cycle of life and death. Nick is on a journey, perhaps he {{sees it as a}} {{religious}} quest given the Christian symbolism of the fish. From the town, a road leads into pristine back-country. It crosses a bridge under which the trout hold steady against the current, just as Nick needs to hold steady. From the bridge he glimpses a kingfisher taking wing, a bird Johnston points out symbolizes [...] "halcyon days, peace and tranquility". A large uprooted tree symbolizes the protagonist himself uprooted by war, and that his fragility is symbolized by the trout he releases carefully so as not to damage its protective slime coat. The campsite symbolizes safety, set deep in a pine grove and described in soothing greens; beyond three dead trees in the background looms the swamp where he will not venture.|$|E
500|$|Blitz hired Belgian Jo Willems as the cinematographer, having collaborated {{previously}} on commercials. Blitz admired Willems' [...] "European sensibility about shooting" [...] {{and wanted}} to use his aesthetic to [...] "tell a story that was equal parts deadpan and suggestive of the 'real' world". In creating a [...] "look" [...] for the film, {{he said that he}} relied upon [...] "almost opposite impulses"—to tell the story intimately but also carry the comedy. Through the film, he used lighting and art direction that felt real, while framing the shots to come across as deadpan. Production designer Rick Butler chose bland, simple furniture and commonplace houses and cars to give the film a sense of <b>timelessness</b> and familiarity. The color palette in both production and costume design was drab and ordinary to give a deadpan undertone. Blitz was most inspired by the cinematography and production design of Hal Ashby's films: [...] "I watched his films again and again... He has a masterful blending of absurd comedy and naturalism." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} almost universally well {{received}} by the music press upon release, with Jon Landau in the newly launched Rolling Stone magazine noting that [...] "When the Byrds get it together on record they are consistently brilliant." [...] Landau went on to praise the Byrds' musical eclecticism, before stating: [...] "Their music is possessed by a never-ending circularity and a rich, child-like quality. It has a <b>timelessness</b> to it, {{not in the sense}} that you think their music will always be valid, but in the sense that it is capable of forcing you to suspend consciousness of time altogether." [...] Crawdaddy! magazine was also enthusiastic in its praise of the album, with Sandy Pearlman describing it as [...] "enchantingly beautiful". Pete Johnson, in his review for the Los Angeles Times, summed up the album as [...] "11 good songs spiked with electronic music, strings, brass, natural and supernatural voices, and the familiar thick texture of McGuinn's guitar playing".|$|E
500|$|The gradual rollout of {{promotion}} {{was inspired}} by advertising of the past, reflecting {{the theme of the}} album. Daft Punk approached Columbia with a specific agenda for the campaign; Rob Stringer of the label recalled that the duo had showed him the book Rock 'n' Roll Billboards of the Sunset Strip as an example of what they wanted. Bangalter felt that physical billboards are more affecting than banner ads and that [...] "SNL is this part of American culture with a certain <b>timelessness</b> to it." [...] The campaign was handled by a small group led by Daft Punk and manager Paul Hahn, with assistance from Kathryn Frazier of the public-relations firm Biz 3. The duo had pursued Columbia in particular because of its long-standing history, as expressed by Bangalter: [...] "It felt interesting conceptually to write this story with a record company like Columbia, with a 125-year legacy." [...] Furthermore, the vinyl labels of the album feature the classic yellow on red Columbia label used on records during said time period.|$|E
500|$|In {{works like}} the Serenade for Strings and the Variations on a Rococo Theme, Tchaikovsky showed he was highly gifted at {{writing in a}} style of 18th century European pastiche. [...] In the ballet The Sleeping Beauty and the opera The Queen of Spades, Tchaikovsky {{graduated}} from imitation to full-scale evocation. This practice, which Alexandre Benois calls [...] "passé-ism," [...] lends an air of <b>timelessness</b> and immediacy, making the past seem {{as though it were}} the present. On a practical level, Tchaikovsky was drawn to past styles because he felt he might find the solution to certain structural problems within them. His Rococo pastiches also may have offered escape into a musical world purer than his own, into which he felt himself irresistibly drawn. (In this sense, Tchaikovsky operated in the opposite manner to Igor Stravinsky, who turned to Neoclassicism partly as a form of compositional self-discovery.) Tchaikovsky's attraction to ballet might have allowed a similar refuge into a fairy-tale world, where he could freely write dance music within a tradition of French elegance.|$|E
500|$|Chris True, {{also from}} AllMusic, {{selected}} the song as a standout track on her Greatest Hits 87-97 album. Jason Lipshutz from Billboard listed [...] "Breathe" [...] at four on their [...] "Kylie Minogue Primer: The Top 10 Past Hits You Need to Know" [...] stating [...] "'Breathe’ {{is the obvious}} stand out, sounding almost like a Nine Inch Nails throwaway in its opening seconds and morphing into a silky, sexy defence of Minogue's experimental side." [...] Louis Virtel from The Backlot listed [...] "Breathe" [...] at number14 on their [...] "Kylie Minogue’s 50 Best Songs, in Honor of Her Birthday" [...] and said [...] "'Breathe' would be a meditative masterpiece if it weren't so confrontational, deadpan, and sexually domineering. Impossible Princess unassuming heart stopper trips into unexpected carnality in its choruses, assuring you 'It won’t be long now' {{as you try to}} time your hyperventilation." [...] According to Tom Parker, who provided the special edition album notes for Impossible Princess, [...] " [...] is a seductive electronic groove, with a hypnotic subtlety and <b>timelessness</b> befitting the theme inward contemplating and resolve." [...] Larry Flick from Billboard said that [...] "Breathe" [...] is a [...] "user-friendly jam" [...] which is [...] "largely due to its big-beat electronic groove and ear-tickling pop chorus." ...|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times complimented {{the song}} {{and said that the}} song [...] "tells good things for this winter's blockbuster-to-be. It's not a reimagining or a musical departure, but simply a righting of the ship. The song is big, bold and seems to have a little spot-o-fun". MTV was also positive, stating that [...] "Adele's lush song fits right in with {{classics}} by Shirley Bassey, Paul McCartney and Carly Simon". The Wall Street Journal felt similarly, writing that the song [...] "has sweep and drama, [...] orchestral support [...] gives it a classical <b>timelessness</b> that sets it apart from typical pop songs. Because it is a theme for a Bond film, after all, the song is also shot through with the threat of violence and death". E! Online wrote that Adele's song was [...] "a cross, and a good one at that, between the 1971 Bassey classic and a more-focused version of Garbage's 'The World Is Not Enough'." [...] The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the song [...] "instantly feels like a Bond theme, with the singer's sultry voice set against a minor chord progression. Done in big, orchestral style, the mood – like the singer – is all 1960s throwback, back when Bond themes like 'Goldfinger' were smooth, seductive and larger than life".|$|E
500|$|James Berardinelli of ReelViews {{gave the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, and claimed that many of the film's ideas for {{altering}} its familiar storyline [...] "sound better on paper than they turn out in execution." [...] Finding it tedious to view the film's story told multiple times, he wrote that the film [...] "slips into boredom." [...] Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle also gave the film {{two and a half}} stars, and although he praised its [...] "snappy dialogue and fresh characterizations", he considered the film's plot underdeveloped and characters lacking in motivation. Peter Rainer writing for The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a C+ and called it [...] "a moderately enjoyable escapade that isn't quite clever enough for adults and not quite imaginative enough for children." [...] He was not overly critical of the film, but felt that it was a disappointment in comparison to the high standards for computer-animated films set by Pixar. Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News suggested that <b>timelessness</b> is a necessary component of an animated classic, and faulted the film for its attempt to be hip and current. While Ty Burr of The Boston Globe praised the film's vocal performances, he wrote, [...] "Hoodwinked never builds to a level of sustained comic mania... One aches to think what the great Looney Tunes directors could have done with this material." ...|$|E
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} special a grade of C, criticizing it {{as a mere}} promotional vehicle for Gaga with the Muppets a last-minute addition. The {{production}} was unable to balance Gaga's album promotion with a Muppets holiday special: [...] "Nothing in Lady Gaga & The Muppets' Holiday Spectacular destroys {{the sanctity of the}} Muppets ... However, the potential for a Muppets holiday special was never given room to materialize amidst a Lady Gaga concert special designed to sell her new album. The choice to combine the two may have reached out to a broader audience, but the incongruence of the special's various parts... was bound to frustrate a sizable portion of that audience." [...] Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times agreed, criticizing the special's commercial nature; he also said its songs were [...] "less fit for a Muppet-like music special, and no one seemed willing to stray too far from the show's message of selling a product. Rather than aim for holiday <b>timelessness,</b> this was self-promotion, with the Muppets often coming to Gaga's world than the other way around." [...] Billboards Chris Willman also gave it a negative review, citing the show's palpably-low budget and its dialogue, guest appearances, Gaga's lip-syncing and production: [...] "There was a familiar 'why is this happening?' question hovering over the star-crossed proceedings, albeit without the benefit of any guest stars as seriously wacky as that ones to show up and redeem the incongruousness." ...|$|E
500|$|According to a February 2009 {{article by}} The Hindu, Nagesh gave Tamil cinema {{one of its}} [...] "memorable vintage comedy scenes" [...] as the intrepid storyteller/film director. The news agency, Press Trust of India, noted that his role as {{aspiring}} director Chellappa is still remembered by Tamil filmgoers. Ramya Kannan of The Hindu said, [...] "Kadhalikka Neramillai broke out on celluloid screens in the South, in glorious Eastman Colour, with songs (by Vishwanathan-Ramamoorthy) that were an instant hit". Also from The Hindu, Meera Srinivasan said, [...] "Kadhalikka Neramillai made waves in the industry and {{remains one of the}} best-loved comedies in Tamil cinema". Another journalist for The Hindu wrote, [...] "Kaadhalikka Neramillai (1964) {{turned out to be a}} superhit, its songs memorable, and some of the scenes featuring T.S.Balaiya and Nagesh... classic comedy". Film critic Naman Ramachandran called it [...] "one of the all-time great comedies of Tamil cinema". Sify wrote, [...] " [...] scenes with Baaliah who played his father has terrific comedy timing and great one-liners". In 2008, M. Suganth of The Times of India rated the film four out of five, calling it [...] "a humorous ride from the first reel to the last and it does so without resorting to cheap humour" [...] and concluded, [...] "Despite being made decades ago, the film has a charm and <b>timelessness</b> that are the hallmarks of any classic." [...] The Hindu N. Kesavan wrote on Sachu's performance, [...] "One cannot forget her role in Kadhalikka Neramillai opposite Nagesh." ...|$|E
500|$|The first song, [...] "Anything Goes", was {{recorded}} by Bennett for his 1959 collaboration with Count Basie and his Orchestra, Strike Up the Band, and Gaga {{first came to}} know about it when she was 13 years old. Gaga thought that [...] "Anything Goes" [...] was a funny track with a [...] "real sexy, powerful vibe to it, and it's just because we're having fun singing it." [...] The version on Cheek to Cheek finds Bennett and Gaga swapping the lyrics between themselves, and was described by Bobby Olivier, from The Star-Ledger, as [...] "smooth as silk". The syllables are pronounced strongly by Gaga in syncopation while her vibrato complemented Bennett's characteristic jazz vocals and swing. Olivier added, [...] "Gaga's voice, when stripped of its bells and whistles, showcases a <b>timelessness</b> that lends itself well to the genre." [...] "I Can't Give You Anything but Love" [...] was originally written in 1928 by Jimmy McHugh and Dorothy Fields for the Broadway revue, Blackbirds of 1928. The version on Cheek to Cheek opens with the sound of high-hat and an electronic organ. Gaga alters the lyrics to sing [...] "Gee, I'd like to say you're looking swell, Tony", who later rejoins with the line [...] "Diamond bracelets won't work, doesn't sell, Gaga". [...] "Nature Boy" [...] was first released as a single in 1948 by Cole, and it became a commercial success for him. Written by eccentric songwriter eden ahbez, the song about a [...] "strange enchanted boy" [...] features instrumentation from flutes and drums, and has an orchestral arrangement. A loungier version, Gaga sings in a Liza Minnelli inspired voice with a breathy range, followed by Bennett complimenting her with the story of meeting the titular character.|$|E
500|$|Throughout most of {{his career}} Kertész was {{depicted}} as the [...] "unknown soldier" [...] who worked behind the scenes of photography, yet was rarely cited for his work, even into his death in the 1980s. Kertész thought himself unrecognised throughout his life, despite spending his life in the eternal search for acceptance and fame. Though Kertész received numerous awards for photography, he never felt both his style and work was accepted by critics and art audiences alike. Although, in 1927, he was the first photographer to have a solo exhibition, Kertész said that it was not until his 1946 exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, that he first felt he received positive reviews on his work, and often cites this show as one of his finest moments in America. During his stay in America, he was cited as being an intimate artist, bringing the viewer into his work, even when the picture was that of subjects such as the intimidating New York City and even his reproduced work printed after his death received good reviews; [...] "Kertész was above all a consistently fine photographer". Kertész's work itself is often described as predominantly utilising light and even Kertész himself said that [...] "I write with light". He was never considered to [...] "comment" [...] on his subjects, but rather capture them – this is often cited as why his work is often overlooked; he stuck to no political agenda and offered no deeper thought to his photographs other than the simplicity of life. With his art's intimate feeling and nostalgic tone, Kertész's images alluded to a sense of <b>timelessness</b> which was inevitably only recognised after his death. Unlike other photographers, Kertész's work gave an insight into his life, showing a chronological order of where he spent his time; for example, many of his French photographs were from cafés where he spent the majority of his time waiting for artistic inspiration.|$|E
