5|$|By {{making use}} of a new power {{obtained}} by Eren {{that allows him to}} create massive and permanent structures, the Survey Corps hold another expedition, this time managing to reach Shiganshina and seal the breach to reclaim Wall Maria. However, they are ambushed by Zeke, the man behind the Titan invasions and the spies, leading an army of Titans including <b>the</b> <b>Colossal</b> Titan against them. The battle ends with Zeke retreating, and <b>the</b> <b>Colossal</b> Titan defeated and killed by Armin, who became a Titan Shifter like Eren, but at the cost of the lives of almost {{all the members of the}} expedition, including the commander of the Survey Corps, Erwin Smith.|$|E
5|$|Although all <b>the</b> <b>colossal</b> {{heads are}} broadly similar, there are {{distinct}} stylistic {{differences in their}} execution. One of the heads from San Lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint, suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated. Heads did not just represent individual Olmec rulers; they also incorporated {{the very concept of}} rulership itself.|$|E

5|$|Jojo the Klownzilla, <b>the</b> <b>colossal</b> clown {{who appears}} {{at the end of}} the film, was {{originally}} intended to be created using stop-motion animation, but was instead portrayed by Charles Chiodo in a rubber suit. In the film's original finale, Deputy Dave dies in the explosion of the clowns' ship, but this was changed after audiences in test screenings desired a more upbeat ending.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>colossal</b> heads {{cannot be}} {{precisely}} dated. However, the San Lorenzo heads were buried by 900BC, indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still. The heads from Tres Zapotes {{had been moved}} from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the heads from La Venta were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface. The period of production of <b>the</b> <b>colossal</b> heads is therefore unknown, as is whether it spanned a century or a millennium. Estimates of the time span during which colossal heads were produced vary from 50 to 200 years. The San Lorenzo heads {{are believed to be}} the oldest, and are the most skillfully executed. All of the stone heads have been assigned to the Preclassic period of Mesoamerican chronology, generally to the Early Preclassic (1500–1000BC), although the two Tres Zapotes heads and the La Cobata Head are attributed to the Middle Preclassic (1000–400BC).|$|E
5|$|The flat {{backs of}} many of <b>the</b> <b>colossal</b> heads {{represented}} the flat bases of the monumental thrones from which they were reworked. Only four of the seventeen heartland heads do not have flattened backs, indicating {{the possibility that the}} majority were reworked monuments. Alternatively, the backs {{of many of}} these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport, providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes. Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olmec thrones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{consensus is}} that the asteroid impact at the K–Pg boundary left megatsunami deposits and sediments around {{the area of the}} Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, from <b>the</b> <b>colossal</b> waves created by the impact.

5|$|The {{story of}} Attack on Titan {{revolves}} around the adventures of Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and their childhood friend Armin Arlert. After the wall which protects their hometown of Shinganshina is breached by <b>the</b> <b>Colossal</b> Titan leading the other Titans to enter, Eren watches in horror as a smiling Titan eats his mother.

5|$|During the {{subsequent}} Potsdam Conference in July–August 1945, {{the three major}} allied powers ratified <b>the</b> <b>colossal</b> westerly shift of Polish borders and approved its new territory between the Oder–Neisse line and Curzon Line. Following {{the destruction of the}} Polish-Jewish population in the Holocaust, the flight and expulsion of Germans in the west, resettlement of Ukrainians in the east, and the repatriation of Poles from Kresy, Poland became {{for the first time in}} its history an ethnically homogeneous nation-state without prominent minorities. The new government solidified its political power over the next two years, while the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) under Bolesław Bierut gained firm control over the country, which would become part of the postwar Soviet sphere of influence in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Molluscs are {{the largest}} marine phylum, {{comprising}} about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish and octopus, {{are among the most}} neurologically advanced of all invertebrates—and either the giant squid or <b>the</b> <b>colossal</b> squid is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total.|$|E
5|$|The affront at {{the heart}} of Show Boat is still very alive today. It begins with the book and its {{negative}} and one-dimensional images of Black people, and continues on through <b>the</b> <b>colossal</b> and deliberate omission of the Black experience, including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues to offend deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don't represent a challenge to them, their privilege and their superiority.|$|E

5|$|The {{entrance}} at {{the north}} side is a short descending corridor lined with red granite followed by a passageway ending at the burial chamber with its gabled roof comprising large limestone beams. Today these beams are damaged, which weakens the pyramid structure. Fragments of the sarcophagus were found here in the burial chamber, {{when it was first}} entered by John Shae Perring in the mid 19th century. <b>The</b> <b>colossal</b> roof blocks of Sahure's temple weighed up to about 220 tons based on estimates by Perring. He estimated the size of the largest blocks at 35 feet by 9 feet by 12 feet. One end of these blocks was tapered so the estimated volume is 95 cubic meters or 2.4 tons. The mortuary complex immediately around the pyramid also comprises a second pyramid built for the Ka of the king.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{repatriation}} {{did not end}} there, though. Upon their return to Australia the effort shifted towards placing the returned soldiers into employment, or education {{and taking care of}} those that were too badly injured to work. In order to meet these needs the Commonwealth established the Repatriation Department, tasked with managing the placement of returned soldiers into employment, training, education, housing. Eventually this also included <b>the</b> <b>colossal</b> task of managing the provision of war pensions, managing repatriation hospitals and convalescent homes and administering the Soldier Settlement Scheme. The total cost of these provisions was considerable, and in June 1935 it was estimated to have cost approximately £238,000,000 which was more than the total amount spent on defence during the war.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{investigation}} of Olmec basalt workshops suggest that <b>the</b> <b>colossal</b> heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away {{both large and}} small flakes of stone. The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones, which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself, although this was not always the case. Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo, indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail. Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in-the-round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses. Monument20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche. Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned. It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re-carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed.|$|E
5|$|Demolition and The Hart Foundation {{had faced}} each other two years earlier at SummerSlam 1988, where Demolition had {{successfully}} defended the WWF Tag Team Championship. The Hart Foundation duo of Jim Neidhart and Bret Hart later focused on singles wrestling but soon reunited as a team. They announced on the March 31 episode of WWF Superstars {{that they wanted to}} challenge for the WWF Tag Team Championship after the WrestleMania match between <b>The</b> <b>Colossal</b> Connection and Demolition. After Demolition won the match, The Hart Foundation faced The Rockers on the April 28 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event. Demolition interfered, causing a double disqualification. On the July 14 episode of WWF Superstars, Demolition and The Hart Foundation brawled after The Hart Foundation claimed that Demolition having three members was evidence of cowardice. The following week, a match between the teams was announced for SummerSlam. The stipulations stated {{that it would be a}} two out of three falls match and that only two members of Demolition would be allowed at ringside.|$|E
5|$|In November 1380, Parliament {{was called}} {{together}} again in Northampton. Archbishop Simon Sudbury, the new Lord Chancellor, updated the Commons on the worsening situation in France, a collapse in international trade, {{and the risk}} of the Crown having to default on its debts. The Commons were told that <b>the</b> <b>colossal</b> sum of £160,000 was now required in new taxes, and arguments ensued between the royal council and Parliament about what to do next. Parliament passed a third poll tax (this time on a flat-rate basis of 12 pence on each person over 15, with no allowance made for married couples) which they estimated would raise £66,666. The third poll tax was highly unpopular and many in the south-east evaded it by refusing to register. The royal council appointed new commissioners in March 1381 to interrogate local village and town officials in an attempt to find those who were refusing to comply. The extraordinary powers and interference of these teams of investigators in local communities, primarily in the south-east and east of England, raised still further the tensions surrounding the taxes.|$|E

50|$|In 1981, Colossal began {{producing}} {{dozens of}} network IDs for MTV, {{which led to}} the company receiving more high-profile clients including Nickelodeon, Levi's, and Coca-Cola. The following year, Gary Gutierrez launched USFX, a new division of Colossal Pictures, while he was working on <b>The</b> Right Stuff. <b>Colossal</b> Pictures started producing computer animation in 1983, when they collaborated with Pacific Data Images to produce a commercial for the Atari game Joust and a network ID for MTV. In 1986, Colossal began working with Western Images using a Quantel Harry unit, resulting in Colossal being able to create state-of-the-art computer graphics. In 1989, Colossal Pictures launched a new division, BIG Pictures, which produced television programs. That September, Colossal Pictures began representing Pixar to produce CGI commercials. As part of <b>the</b> deal, <b>Colossal</b> would receive a project and develop the storyboards, while Pixar animated <b>the</b> project. <b>Colossal</b> Pictures terminated its relationship with Pixar in 1992 when they started production on Toy Story for Walt Disney Pictures.|$|R
