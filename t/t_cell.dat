5|$|Helper T cells express <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptors (TCR) that {{recognize}} antigen {{bound to}} Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also {{recognized by the}} helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> (e.g., Lck) {{that are responsible for}} the T cell's activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting helper <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, helper <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.|$|E
5|$|After {{the virus}} enters the body {{there is a}} period of rapid viral replication, leading to an {{abundance}} of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood. This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> counts recover. A good CD8+ <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.|$|E

After the stimulation with immobilized anti-CD 3 antibodies, both NK-type <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> produced much larger amounts of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) than CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> Both NK-type <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> also acquired a more potent cytotoxicity against NK-sensitive K 562 cells than CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> while only CD 56 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> showed a potent cytotoxicity against NK-resistant Raji cells. After the stimulation {{with a combination of}} interleukin (IL) - 2, IL- 12 and IL- 15, the IFN-γ amounts produced were NK cells ≥ CD 56 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> ≥ CD 57 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> > CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> The cytotoxicities against K 562 cells were NK cells > CD 56 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> ≥ CD 57 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> > CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> while cytotoxicities against Raji cells were CD 56 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> > CD 57 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> ≥ CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> ≥ NK cells. However, the CD 3 -stimulated proliferation of both NK-type <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> was smaller than that of CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> partly because NK-type <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> were susceptible to apoptosis. In addition to NK <b>cells,</b> NK-type <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> but not CD 8 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> stimulated with cytokines, expressed cytoplasmic perforin and granzyme B.

Firstly, an infected <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> can transmit virus directly to a target <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> via a virological synapse. Secondly, an antigen presenting cell (APC) can also transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions in trans (in the case of dendritic cells). Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer {{is reported to be}} much more efficient than cell-free virus spread. A number of factors contribute to this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close apposition of cells which minimizes fluid-phase diffusion of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the target cell to the contact zone. Cell-to-cell spread is thought to be particularly important in lymphoid tissues where CD4+ T lymphocytes are densely packed and likely to frequently interact. Intravital imaging studies have supported the concept of the HIV virological synapse in vivo. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E
40|$|The {{peripheral}} Foxp 3 (+) Treg pool {{consists of}} naturally arising Treg (nTreg) and adaptive Treg cells (iTreg). It {{is well known}} that naive CD 4 (+) <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> can be readily converted to Foxp 3 (+) iTreg in vitro, and memory CD 4 (+) <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are resistant to conversion. In this study, we investigated the induction of Foxp 3 (+) <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> from various CD 4 (+) T-cell subsets in human peripheral blood. Though naive CD 4 (+) <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> were readily converted to Foxp 3 (+) <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> with TGF-β and IL- 2 treatment in vitro, such Foxp 3 (+) <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> did not express the memory marker CD 45 RO as do Foxp 3 (+) <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> induced in the peripheral blood of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) patients. Interestingly, a subset of human memory CD 4 (+) <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> defined as CD 62 L(+) central memory <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> could be induced by TGF-β to differentiate into Foxp 3 (+) <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> It {{is well known that}} Foxp 3 (+) <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> derived from human CD 4 (+) CD 25 (-) <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro are lack suppressive functions.

40|$|T {{lymphocytes}} recognize specific ligands by clonally distributed T-cell receptors (TCR).

Almost all of our knowledge about <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> stems from alpha/beta <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> and only now are we beginning to understand gamma/delta <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> In contrast to conventional alpha/beta <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> which are specific for antigenic peptides presented by gene products of the major histocompatibility complex, gamma/delta <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> directly recognize proteins and even nonproteinacious phospholigands. These findings reveal that gamma/delta <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> and alpha/beta <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> recognize antigen in a fundamentally different way and hence mitigate the dogma of exclusive peptide-major histocompatibility complex recognition by <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> A role for gamma/delta <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in antimicrobial immunity has been firmly established. Although some gamma/delta <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> perform effector functions, regulation of the professional and the nonprofessional immune system seems to be of at least equal importance.
