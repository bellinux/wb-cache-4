5|$|The People's Pledge was {{a popular}} concept, which Common Cause {{proposed}} being implemented in other races. The pledge also resulted in fewer attack ads on <b>the</b> <b>airwaves.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Syrians {{responded by}} {{launching}} about 100 fighter aircraft {{to stop the}} attacks. Intercepting IAF pilots relied frequently on VHF radio, in hopes of preserving their tactical communications and links to the command post. Selective airborne communications jamming disrupted <b>the</b> <b>airwaves</b> for the MiG-21s and MiG-23s and cut them off from ground control, making them vulnerable to AWACS-directed attacks from the Israeli F-15s and F-16s.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{transmission}} of Mine All Mine, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce the revival of Doctor Who, which completed his decade-long quest to return the series to <b>the</b> <b>airwaves.</b> At the time, he was developing two scripts: the first, a cinematic adaptation of the Charles Ingram-Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? scandal, was cancelled after he accepted the Doctor Who job; and the second, a dramatisation {{of the life of}} the Venetian adventurer and lover Giacomo Casanova, was his next show with Red Productions.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Honda <b>Airwave</b> was a subcompact car {{produced}} by the Japanese automaker Honda from 2005 to 2010.

5|$|In 2005 {{the group}} moved to WMQM's Millington-based sister station, AM1380 WLRM, and {{switched}} to a nightly schedule, Monday through Friday. Farley left the program in November of that year. Two years later, Geoff Melton, a former co-host, joined to help set up the show's website and the show entered syndication with Dixie Broadcasting Radio Network. The program went on hiatus on February 15, 2008, because staff members said they needed a break, but returned to <b>the</b> <b>airwaves</b> in June 2008 on WLRM on Saturday nights. One year later, it switched from Republic Broadcasting Network to Liberty News Radio Network. As of August 2009, Bonds and Melton are no longer affiliated with the program. Frith now lives in Nashville, Michigan, but remains {{a part of the}} show's staff. Since WLRM is not audited by Arbitron, the show's ratings are unknown. The show is listener-supported and, according to Edwards, receives more donations from Florida than from any other state.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 2012, Savage's {{talk show}} left <b>the</b> <b>airwaves</b> after {{he won a}} legal battle with Talk Radio Network, his {{longtime}} employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way. Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via Ustream on September 30, 2012. On October 17, 2012, Savage and his new syndicator Cumulus Media Networks announced that they had made a deal and the program, after several weeks off the air, would be returning as of October 23, 2012. By April 2013, according to the radio industry's Talkers Magazine, Savage had 3.5+ million weekly listeners, putting him in a six-way tie for sixth place, and six talk show hosts getting 7.5+ million weekly listeners. On September 26, 2013 Cumulus Media Networks announced that Michael Savage's radio show, The Savage Nation, would move to the 3p-6p ET time-slot beginning in January 2014. This time slot had been occupied by Sean Hannity.|$|E

40|$|In marine time-domain controlled-source {{electromagnetics}} (CSEM), {{there are}} two different acquisition methods: with horizontal sources for fast and simple data acquisition or with vertical sources for minimizing the effects of <b>the</b> <b>airwave.</b> Illustrations of <b>the</b> electric field as a function of space and time for various source antenna orientations, based on analytical formulation of the electric field in two half-spaces, provide insights into the properties of <b>the</b> <b>airwave</b> and <b>the</b> nature of diffuse electric fields. Observing the development of the electric field over time and space reveals that diffusive fields exhibit directionality. Therefore, techniques that have thus far mostly been applied to wavefields can be adapted for CSEM. Examples range from the well-known up-down decomposition to beam steering. Vertical sources have the advantage of not creating an <b>airwave.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, it is quite difficult to achieve perfect verticality of the source antenna. Results, using a numerically modeled data set to analyze the impact of <b>the</b> <b>airwave</b> on a signal from a subsurface reservoir {{in the case of a}} slightly dipping vertical source, indicate that already for a dip of 0. 05, <b>the</b> <b>airwave</b> contributes 20 % to the complete electric field in our configuration of reservoir depth, water thickness, and conductivity values.
