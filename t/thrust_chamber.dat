2500|$|The word [...] "gimbal" [...] {{began as}} a noun. Most modern {{dictionaries}} continue to list it as such. Lacking a convenient term to describe the swinging movement of a rocket engine, engineers began also using the word [...] "gimbal" [...] as a verb. When a <b>thrust</b> <b>chamber</b> is swung by an attached actuator, the movement {{is referred to as}} [...] "gimballed" [...] or [...] "gimballing". [...] Official rocket documentation reflects this usage.|$|E
2500|$|TCE {{has also}} {{been used in the}} United States to clean kerosene-fueled rocket engines (TCE was not used to clean hydrogen-fueled engines such as the Space Shuttle Main Engine). [...] During static firing, the RP-1 fuel would leave {{hydrocarbon}} deposits and vapors in the engine. [...] These deposits had to be flushed from the engine to avoid the possibility of explosion during engine handling and future firing. [...] TCE was used to flush the engine's fuel system immediately before and after each test firing. [...] The flushing procedure involved pumping TCE through the engine's fuel system and letting the solvent overflow for a period ranging from several seconds to 30â€“35 minutes, depending upon the engine. [...] For some engines, the engine's gas generator and LOX dome were also flushed with TCE prior to test firing. [...] The F-1 rocket engine had its LOX dome, gas generator, and <b>thrust</b> <b>chamber</b> fuel jacket flushed with TCE during launch preparations.|$|E
50|$|Several Soviet and Russian rocket engines use the {{approach}} of clustering small combustion chambers around a single turbine and pump. During the early 1950s, many Soviet engine designers, including Valentin P.

The designs were made possible through the versatility of the electroforming procedure, which is not limited to simple geometric shapes. An advanced method of electroforming was used to produce a wire-wrapped, composite, pressure-loaded electroformed structure, which greatly increased the strength of the structure while still retaining the advantages of electroforming...|$|R
50|$|The {{first stage}} of the Atlas I was derived from Atlas G, and the second stage was a Centaur. The first stage had an {{improved}} MA-5A propulsion system, consisting of the LR-89 booster engine with dual <b>thrust</b> <b>chambers</b> and a more powerful RS-27 replacing the traditional LR-105 sustainer engine. With the new RS-27 sustainer engine, {{all three of the}} large Atlas <b>thrust</b> <b>chambers</b> produced equal <b>thrust.</b> Booster engine jettison occurred prior to sustainer engine cut-off for stage-and-a-half staging of the Atlas. (Used in conjunction with the Centaur, this gave the Atlas I 2.5 stages).|$|R
2500|$|The {{mission was}} {{launched}} at the planned time, 02:13:00 PM EST (19:13:00 UTC) on April 11. An anomaly {{occurred when the}} second-stage, center (inboard) engine shut down about two minutes early. The four outboard engines and the third-stage engine burned longer to compensate, and the vehicle achieved {{very close to the}} planned circular [...] parking orbit, followed by a normal translunar injection about two hours later. The engine shutdown was determined to be caused by severe pogo oscillations measured at a strength of 68 g and a frequency of 16 hertz, flexing the thrust frame by [...] The vehicle's guidance system shut the engine down in response to sensed <b>thrust</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure fluctuations. Pogo oscillations had been seen on previous Titan rockets, and also on the Saturn V during Apollo 6, but on Apollo 13, they were amplified by an unexpected interaction with turbopump cavitation. Later missions implemented anti-pogo modifications that had been under development. These included addition of a helium-gas reservoir to the center engine liquid oxygen line to damp pressure oscillations, an automatic cutoff as a backup, and simplification of the propellant valves of all five second-stage engines.|$|E

2500|$|The RASCAL was {{powered by}} a XLR67-BA-1 rocket engine also {{developed}} by Bell. The XLR-67 provided [...] of thrust using three vertical in-line <b>thrust</b> <b>chambers.</b> All three <b>thrust</b> <b>chambers</b> of the XLR67 were operated during the missile's boost phase which could last up to two minutes. At {{the conclusion of the}} boost phase the upper and lower chambers of the XLR-67 were shut down and thrust was sustained by the center chamber alone. Fuel for the XLR-67 included [...] of white fuming nitric acid oxidizer and [...] of JP-4 jet fuel. The oxidizer was stored in a series of tube bundles instead of a spherical storage tank. It is believed this configuration was chosen because it weighed less than a spherical tank of the same volume. Propellant was provided to the <b>thrust</b> <b>chambers</b> by a turbine driven propellant pump. A gas generator powered the propellant pump. The propellants were glow plug ignited.

50|$|The {{heart of}} the engine was the <b>thrust</b> <b>chamber,</b> which mixed and burned the fuel and {{oxidizer}} to produce thrust.

Below this dome were the injectors, which directed fuel and oxidizer into the <b>thrust</b> <b>chamber</b> in a way designed to promote mixing and combustion. Fuel was supplied to the injectors from a separate manifold; some of the fuel first traveled in 178 tubes down the length of the <b>thrust</b> <b>chamber</b> â€” which formed approximately the upper half of the exhaust nozzle â€” and back in order to cool the nozzle.|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{intended}} to evaluate the relative weight of convective and radiative wall heat transfer in LRE <b>thrust</b> <b>chambers.</b> In particular, an appropriate computational tool, based on the Discrete Transfer Method, is set up to evaluate the radiative heat flux at the wall.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} and understand the thermomechanical behaviour of copper matrix composites with long fibres. The effects of the volume fraction of fibres are considered in this analysis. A micromechanical finite element model {{has been used to}} study the behaviour of the copper matrix composites reinforced with tungsten fibres, which undergo thermal cycling conditions. Furthermore, regular and random arrangements of fibres are considered. Introduction. Metal matrix composites are potential candidates for high temperature applications, for example, as heat sinks in <b>thrust</b> <b>chambers.</b> These composites should be able to keep their original dimensions, when subjected to thermal and mechanical loads. The <b>thrust</b> <b>chambers</b> undergo thermal cycles in service, which induce deformation in the material.

50|$|The <b>thrust</b> <b>chamber</b> {{injector}} {{received the}} propellants {{under pressure from}} the turbopumps, then mixed them in a manner that produced the most efficient combustion. 614 hollow oxidizer posts were machined to form {{an integral part of the}} injector, with fuel nozzles (each swaged to the face of the injector) threaded through and installed over the oxidizer posts in concentric rings. The injector face was porous, being formed from layers of stainless steel wire mesh, and was welded at its periphery to the injector body. The injector received LOX through the dome manifold and injected it through the oxidizer posts into the combustion area of the <b>thrust</b> <b>chamber,</b> while fuel was received from the upper fuel manifold in the <b>thrust</b> <b>chamber</b> and injected through the fuel orifices which were concentric with the oxidizer orifices. The propellants were injected uniformly to ensure satisfactory combustion. The injector and oxidizer dome assembly was located at the top of the <b>thrust</b> <b>chamber.</b> The dome provided a manifold for the distribution of the LOX to the injector and served as a mount for the gimbal bearing and the augmented spark igniter.|$|E

50|$|Rocketdyne tested {{its first}} S-3 engine at their Santa Susana, California {{facilities}} in November 1955. A mock-up {{was delivered to}} ABMA in January 1956, and followed with the first prototype engines in July 1956. Testing of these engines began in September 1956 at ABMA's new Power Plant Test Stand. This demonstrated {{a number of problems}} with unstable combustion, leading to the failure of four engines by November. To continue testing, the engine was temporarily derated back to 135,000 lbf, and they were successfully tested at this level in January 1957. Continued work on the engine developed several sub-versions, finally reaching the design goal of 150,000 lbf in the S-3D model. The 135,000 pound engine, also used in the first Thor and Atlas tests, had conical <b>thrust</b> <b>chambers,</b> but the 150,000 pound model switched to bell-shaped <b>thrust</b> <b>chambers.</b>|$|R
