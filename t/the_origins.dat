In R n {{equipped}} with the Euclidean metric, the distance from <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> is smooth and infinite harmonic everywhere except <b>the</b> <b>origin.</b> Using geodesics, we find a geometric characterization for when the distance from <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> in an arbitrary Carnot-Carathéodory space is a viscosity infinite harmonic function at a point outside <b>the</b> <b>origin.</b> We show that at points in the Heisenberg group and Grushin plane where this condition fails, the distance from <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> is not a viscosity infinite harmonic subsolution. In addition, the distance function is not a viscosity infinite harmonic supersolution at <b>the</b> <b>origin.</b> 1...|$|R
