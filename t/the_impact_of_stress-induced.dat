40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of acute stress on attentional bias to threat using behavioral and ERP methods. Sixty-two male participants {{were randomly assigned to}} a stress condition (Trier Social Stress Test) or a control condition. To examine <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress-induced</b> cortisol on attentional bias to threat, participants in the stress group were split into Low-and High cortisol responders. All participants were then administered a modified dot probe task in which the cues were neutral and angry faces. Behavioral results showed a pattern of attentional bias toward threat in the Control group but not in the stress group. For the ERPs, the P 100 peaked earlier for the angry-cued targets than the neutralcued targets in the Control group, which suggests a rapid, adaptive response toward threat. However, this effect was not observed in the stress group, suggesting a suppressed attentional bias under stress. In addition, the stress group (including both Low and High cortisol responders) showed reduced P 300 amplitude to target onset than the Control group. These results suggest that acute stress disrupts attentional bias to threat including a reduction in early bias to threat in addition to a subsequent change of attention allocation. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{generalized}} {{process of}} mRNA decay involves deadenylation followed by release from translating polysomes, decapping, and exonuclease decay of the mRNA body. In contrast the mRNA endonuclease PMR 1 forms a selective complex with its translating substrate mRNA, where it initiates decay by cleaving within the mRNA body. In stressed cells the phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 causes translating mRNAs to accumulate with stalled 48 S subunits in large subcellular structures termed stress granules (SGs), wherein mRNAs undergo sorting for reinitiation, storage, or decay. Given the unique relationship between translation and PMR 1 -mediated mRNA decay, we examined <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress-induced</b> dissociation of polysomes on this process. Arsenite stress disrupts the polysome binding of PMR 1 and its substrate mRNA {{but has no}} impact on the critical tyrosine phosphorylation of PMR 1, its association with substrate mRNA, or its association with the functional ∼ 680 -kDa mRNP complex in which it normally resides on polysomes. We show that arsenite stress drives PMR 1 into an RNase-resistant complex with TIA- 1, and we identify a distinct domain in the N terminus of PMR 1 that facilitates its interaction with TIA- 1. Finally, we show that arsenite promotes the delayed association of PMR 1 with SGs under conditions which cause tristetraprolin and butyrate response factor 1, proteins that facilitate exonucleolytic mRNA, to exit SGs...|$|E
40|$|Stress is implicated as a {{contributing}} factor in Alzheimers Disease (AD). Individuals prone to psychological distress {{as a consequence of}} stress exposure are at three times greater risk of AD than age-matched controls. Hyperphosphorylation of tau is a key event leading to AD neurofibrillary tangles, which positively correlates with cognitive decline. Because tau is the primary stabilizing protein of microtubules (MTs), it is thought that tau phosphorylation (tau-P) and aggregation causes dissociation of tau on MTs, leading to MT destabilization and disruption in axonal transport. We have shown that restraint stress induces hippocampal tau-P in rodents, a process that involves corticotropin- releasing factor receptor type 1 (CRFR 1), with repeated exposure showing increased hippocampal tau-P in insoluble aggregates. Although these data provide a potential link between chronic stress and AD tauopathy, <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress-induced</b> tau-P on neuronal function is still unclear. To test the hypothesis that stress-induced tau-P causes dissociation of tau from MTs and dysfunction in axonal transport, we developed a neuronal in vitro system to analyze how modulation of tau by stress hormones impact cell viability and axonal transport of cargoes. Mouse hippocampal neurons were exposed to stress-system intermediates : CRF, corticosterone (cort), or control for 0 - 24 hours. CRF and cort showed increased tau-P over the timecourse examined. We also observed activation of specific tau kinases. We examined characteristics of axonal transport of mitochondria and BDNF. Collectively, our results suggest that stress alters cellular processes and CRFR 1 antagonism may be a useful therapeutic strategy for AD tauopathy and neuronal dysfunctio...|$|E
40|$|Stress {{exposure}} or {{increased levels}} of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) induce hippocampal tau phosphorylation (tau-P) in rodent models, {{a process that is}} dependent on the type- 1 CRF receptor (CRFR 1). Although these preclinical studies on stress-induced tau-P provide mechanistic insight for epidemiological work that identifies stress as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), <b>the</b> actual <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress-induced</b> tau-P on neuronal function remains unclear. To determine the functional consequences <b>of</b> <b>stress-induced</b> tau-P, we developed a novel mouse neuronal cell culture system to explore <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> acute (0. 5 hr) and chronic (2 hr) CRF treatment on tau-P and integral cell processes such as axon transport. Consistent with in vivo reports, we found that chronic CRF treatment increased tau-P levels and caused globular accumulations of phosphorylated tau in dendritic and axonal processes. Furthermore, while both acute and chronic CRF treatment led to significant reduction in CREB activation and axon transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), {{this was not the case}} with mitochondrial transport. Acute CRF treatment caused increased mitochondrial velocity and distance traveled in neurons, while chronic CRF treatment modestly decreased mitochondrial velocity and greatly increased distance traveled. These results suggest that transport of cellular energetics may take priority over growth factors during stress. Tau-P was required for these changes, as co-treatment of CRF with a GSK kinase inhibitor prevented CRF-induced tau-P and all axon transport changes. Collectively, our results provide mechanistic insight into the consequences of stress peptide-induced tau-P and provide an explanation for how chronic stress via CRF may lead to neuronal vulnerability in AD...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} impact climate by scattering and absorbing {{solar radiation}} and by acting as ice and cloud condensation nuclei. Biogenic secondary organic aerosols (BSOAs) comprise {{an important component}} of atmospheric aerosols. Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by vegetation are the source of BSOAs. Pathogens and insect attacks, heat waves and droughts can induce stress to plants that may impact their BVOC emissions, and hence the yield and type of formed BSOAs, and possibly their climatic effects. This raises questions <b>of</b> whether <b>stress-induced</b> changes in BSOA formation may attenuate or amplify effects of climate change. In this study we assess <b>the</b> potential <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress-induced</b> BVOC emissions on BSOA formation for tree species typical for mixed deciduous and Boreal Eurasian forests. We studied the photochemical BSOA formation for plants infested by aphids in a laboratory setup under well-controlled conditions and applied in addition heat and drought stress. The results indicate that stress conditions substantially modify BSOA formation and yield. <b>Stress-induced</b> emissions <b>of</b> sesquiterpenes, methyl salicylate, and C 17 -BVOCs increase BSOA yields. Mixtures including these compounds exhibit BSOA yields between 17 and 33 %, significantly higher than mixtures containing mainly monoterpenes (4 – 6 % yield). Green leaf volatiles suppress SOA formation, presumably by scavenging OH, similar to isoprene. By classifying emission types, stressors and BSOA formation potential, we discuss possible climatic feedbacks regarding aerosol effects. We conclude that stress situations for plants due to climate change should be considered in climate–vegetation feedback mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveOur {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to clarify <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shear <b>stress-induced</b> reactive hyperemia (associated with reperfusion) in preconditioning-mediated protection. MethodsIn control rat hearts, a 40 -minute preischemic perfusion (constant pressure: 70 mm Hg) period {{was followed by}} 25 -minute global low-flow ischemia (constant flow: 0. 3 mL/min) and 30 -minute reperfusion (constant pressure). As preconditioning protocol, hearts underwent 2 cycles of 5 -minute no-flow ischemia/ 5 -minute reperfusion. ResultsAlthough coronary vasodilation in response to shear stress is severely impaired after global low-flow ischemia and reperfusion, it is fully preserved by ischemic preconditioning concomitantly with an improvement of left ventricular developed pressure. Restricting coronary peak flow to 100 % of baseline at reperfusion reduced left ventricular recovery to the control level. NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester affects the restoration of reperfusion-reactive hyperemia and the improvement of contractile recovery afforded by ischemic preconditioning. However, if {{the time course of}} hyperemia was restored by forcibly reperfusing to 150 % of baseline for 10 minutes and, therefore, by restricting final peak flow to 80 % of baseline for 20 minutes, contractile function recovered to a high degree despite the presence of NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. ConclusionWe conclude that wall stretch and shear stress during reperfusion are necessary for the mediation phase of preconditioning...|$|R
