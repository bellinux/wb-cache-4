5|$|Rubinstein's {{first step}} was to found the Russian Musical Society (RMS) in 1859. Its {{objectives}} were to educate people in music, cultivate their musical tastes and develop <b>their</b> <b>talents</b> in that area of their lives. The first priority of the RMS acted was to expose to the public the music of native composers. In addition to a considerable amount of Western European music, works by Mussorgsky and Cui were premiered by the RMS under Rubinstein's baton. A few weeks after the Society's premiere concert, Rubinstein started organizing music classes, which were open to everyone. Interest in these classes grew until Rubinstein founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1862.|$|E
5|$|Peking opera was {{initially}} an exclusively male pursuit. The Qianlong Emperor had banned all female performers in Beijing in 1772. The appearance {{of women on}} the stage began unofficially during the 1870s. Female performers began to impersonate male roles and declared equality with men. They were given a venue for <b>their</b> <b>talents</b> when Li Maoer, himself a former Peking-opera performer, founded the first female Peking-opera troupe in Shanghai. By 1894, the first commercial venue showcasing female performance troupes appeared in Shanghai. This encouraged other female troupes to form, which gradually increased in popularity. As a result, theatre artist Yu Zhenting petitioned for {{the lifting of the}} ban after the founding of the Republic of China in 1911. This was accepted, and the ban was lifted in 1912, although male Dan continued to be popular after this period.|$|E
5|$|Steve Burke {{served as}} the audio lead on the Kameo project, his first at Rare, for which he {{composed}} its soundtrack and contributed to its sound effects and voiceovers. As the game was originally planned for the GameCube, {{the first few months}} of development appeared to have no support for audio above the MIDI sample-style compositions characteristic of Nintendo's previous console, the Nintendo 64. The game's first demo at the 2001 Electronic Entertainment Expo used this type of audio. Of the first pieces he wrote for this project in the early months of 2001, some were scrapped. Others were re-recorded as streaming audio, which plays pre-recorded audio files, when the developers added support. It became Rare's first orchestral soundtrack. Other Rare staff members contributed <b>their</b> <b>talents</b> to the recording process, such as trumpet and voice recordings.|$|E

5|$|Weyard {{is governed}} by the mythological concept of the {{classical}} elements. All matter on Weyard consists of any combination of the four base elements: Venus, Mars, Mercury and Jupiter, or earth, fire, water, and wind, respectively. These four building blocks of reality can be manipulated by the omnipotent force of Alchemy, which reigned supreme in the world's ancient past. Alchemy was sealed away in the past, however, and {{the world in the}} present age has become seemingly devoid of this power. However, in various places throughout the world, people demonstrate an aptitude to manipulate one of the elements through a form of magic called Psynergy. These wielders of Psynergy, called Adepts, usually refrain from displaying <b>their</b> <b>talents</b> to outsiders.|$|E
