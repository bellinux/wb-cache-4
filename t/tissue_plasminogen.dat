25|$|Urokinase is used {{clinically}} as a thrombolytic {{agent in}} the treatment of severe or massive deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and occluded intravenous or dialysis cannulas. It is also administered intrapleurally to improve the drainage of complicated pleural effusions and empyemas. Urokinase is marketed as Abbokinase or Kinlytic and competes with recombinant <b>tissue</b> <b>plasminogen</b> activator (e.g., alteplase) as a thrombolytic drug in infarction. However, urokinase is not very selective for clot-bound plasminogen, unlike <b>tissue</b> <b>plasminogen</b> activator (TPA) which preferentially interacts with clot-bound plasminogen. Because urokinase binds about equally to freely circulating plasminogen and clot-bound plasminogen, it causes significant fibrinogenolysis and clot fibrinolysis making its use less favorable than TPA.|$|E
25|$|PAI-1 is a serine {{protease}} inhibitor (serpin) that functions {{as the principal}} inhibitor of <b>tissue</b> <b>plasminogen</b> activator (tPA) and urokinase (uPA), the activators of plasminogen and hence fibrinolysis (the physiological breakdown of blood clots). It is a {{serine protease}} inhibitor (serpin) protein (SERPINE1).|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} {{the hypothesis that the}} release of <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator may play a prominent role in endothelin induced gastric mucosal injury. We determined <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator activity in the regional blood sample and the concentration of platelet activating factor in the gastric mucosa after the administration of endothelin- 1 in a range of 50 - 500 pmol/kg into the left gastric artery of male Wistar rats. Endothelin- 1 increased the <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator release and platelet activating factor formation, and induced subsequent gastric mucosal haemorrhagic change in a dose dependent manner. In addition CV- 6209, a selective platelet activating factor blocker, attenuated the activation of regional <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator and the development of mucosal damage induced by endothelin- 1. The results of this study showed that <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator activation may {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of endothelin induced mucosal injury of rat stomach, and suggest that the platelet activating factor may be involved in the process of regional fibrinolytic activation induced by endothelin- 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{gastroduodenal}} mucosa has a rich blood supply. An active fibrinolytic {{system is}} presumably {{required to maintain}} vascular patency, and impairment may result in reduced blood flow, focal tissue necrosis, and peptic ulcerogenesis. Tissue type and urokinase type plasminogen activator activity (expressed as mIU/mg protein) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type- 1 antigen were assayed in homogenates of gastric and duodenal biopsy specimens taken from patients with: normal endoscopy (controls) (n = 14); active duodenal ulcer (n = 21); healed duodenal ulcer (n = 12); and active benign gastric ulcer (n = 15). In controls mean duodenal <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator activity was 4110 and urokinase type plasminogen activator activity 150; gastric <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator was 2760 and urokinase type plasminogen activator 170; plasminogen activator inhibitor type- 1 was generally undetectable. At the edge of active duodenal ulcers <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator was considerably reduced, 2220 (p < 0. 001) whereas urokinase type plasminogen activator was raised, 290 (p < 0. 01). At the edge of active benign gastric ulcers <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator was substantially reduced, 1160 (p < 0. 001) but urokinase type plasminogen activator was unchanged. At the scar of healed duodenal ulcers <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator was slightly reduced, 3290, but urokinase type plasminogen activator was increased, 308 (p < 0. 05). H 2 receptor antagonist treatment {{had little effect on}} tissue type or urokinase type plasminogen activator activity. Plasminogen activator inhibitor type- 1 was increased at the edge of active ulcers (p < 0. 05) especially when <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activity was low (r = - 0. 61, p < 0. 05).

40|$|Carcinogenesis in {{the human}} colon is {{associated}} with a marked increase of urokinase type plasminogen activator and a decrease of <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator. This study was performed to determine the concentrations of urokinase type <b>plasminogen</b> activator and <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator in normal tissue and carcinomas along {{the upper part of the}} gastrointestinal tract. Activity and antigen levels of both activators were determined in homogenates of endoscopically obtained biopsies from normal and carcinomatous tissues. Although the concentrations of <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator and urokinase type plasminogen activator in normal squamous epithelium of the oesophagus were low compared with those in columnar epithelium from the stomach, the urokinase type plasminogen activator/tissue type plasminogen activator antigen ratio of the different locations showed hardly any difference. Significant but heterogeneous increases were found in urokinase type plasminogen activator concentrations of biopsy specimens originating from carcinomas of both epithelial cell types. A decrease in <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator concentrations, as found in human colon carcinomas, could only be shown in carcinomas of columnar epithelium origin but not in squamous cell carcinomas of the oesophagus. The increase of urokinase type plasminogen activator and urokinase type plasminogen activator/tissue type plasminogen activator antigen ratio and the decrease of <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator in the carcinomas did not show a significant correlation with known prognostic determinants as differentiation grade, TNM classification, intestinal metaplasia, inflammation, and ulceration. The heterogeneous increase of urokinase type plasminogen activator in oesophageal and stomach carcinomas, together with the recently described association of urokinase type <b>plasminogen</b> activator in <b>tissue</b> extracts of breast carcinomas with aggressiveness and prognosis, may be relevance to prognostic studies, may be of relevance to prognostic studies in oesophageal and gastric cancer...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages on the fibrinolytic system and to assess whether these effects could help explain the relation between moderate alcohol consumption and reduced coronary heart disease. DESIGN [...] Four treatments were allocated in a randomised controlled order on four days {{over a period of}} 11 days. SETTING [...] Metabolic ward of research institute. SUBJECTS [...] Eight white healthy middle aged men. INTERVENTIONS [...] Subjects were provided with food for the 11 days. On the four study days mineral water or 40 g of alcohol in the form of beer, wine, or spirits was consumed at dinner early in the evening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator antigen, and <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator activity one hour before and one, three, five, nine, and 13 hours after dinner with mineral water or alcoholic beverages. RESULTS [...] After dinner with alcohol plasminogen activator inhibitor activity rose from 53 (SD 19) % to a maximum of 667 (283 %) five hours after dinner (P < 0. 001). <b>Tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator antigen levels rose from 5. 3 (2. 2) micrograms/l to a maximum of 10. 8 (3. 8) micrograms/l nine hours after dinner with alcohol (P < 0. 001). Plasminogen activator activity was reduced in the postprandial period (from 1387 (483) IU/l to 323 (288) IU/l five hours after eating; P < 0. 001) but was higher than normal early the next morning (1516 (809) IU/l after alcohol, 779 (516) IU/l after water; P = 0. 04). CONCLUSION [...] Moderate alcohol consumption with dinner affects plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, plasminogen activator antigen level, and <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator activity temporarily.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the rat as an experimental model for plasminogen activator research, {{the ability of}} antibodies specific for human <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator and urokinase to suppress the plasminogen activator activity in whole plasma and in the vessel wall was studied in both rat and man. Plasminogen activator activity in plasma was assayed on fibrin plates containing plasminogen. Plasminogen activator in the vessel wall was shown by the fibrin side technique. Antibodies against human tissue type melanoma cell activator and urokinase were raised in goats and mixed into the fibrin film or the fibrin plates. In both species antibodies to melanoma cell activator were able to suppress the plasminogen activator activity completely in plasma and in the vessel wall. Anti-urokinase, however, had no suppressing effect. In rat plasma the inhibitory effect on the fibrinolytic activity was seen only with high concentrations of antibodies against melanoma cell activator, which suggests that rat plasminogen activator in plasma and vessel walls is similar to, but not identical with, human <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator...|$|R

25|$|Lp(a) is {{assembled}} at the hepatocyte {{cell membrane}} surface, while other scenarios exist {{with regard to}} the location of assembly. It mainly exists in plasma. Lp(a) contributes to the process of atherogenesis. Because of its structural similarity to plasminogen and <b>tissue</b> <b>plasminogen</b> activator, competitive inhibition leads to reduced fibrinolysis, {{and as a result of}} the stimulation of secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, Lp(a) leads to thrombogenesis. It may also enhance coagulation by inhibiting the function of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Lp(a) carries cholesterol and binds atherogenic proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids as a preferential carrier of oxidized phospholipids in human plasma, which attract inflammatory cells to vessel walls and leads to smooth muscle cell proliferation. Moreover, Lp(a) is also hypothesized to be involved in wound healing and tissue repair, interacting with components of the vascular wall and extra cellular matrix.

40|$|Expression of <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> {{activator}} {{and type}} 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor, and persistent fibrin deposition in chronic renal allograft failure. Persistent fibrin deposition {{has been observed}} in kidneys undergoing chronic rejection, and has been suggested {{to contribute to the}} obliteration of the vasculature in these grafts. The mechanisms leading to it are not clear. Fibrinolysis, the process to remove fibrin in tissues, is initiated by <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator (tPA) and suppressed by type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI- 1). To investigate their roles in chronic rejection and fibrin deposition, we serially examined the expression of tPA and PAI- 1 in an unmodified chronic rejection model, using a Fisher 344 to Lewis rat renal transplant, at 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 16 and 20 weeks post-transplantation (N = 4 rats/time point in each group). We also analyzed fibrin deposition and the development of chronic changes in the grafts. Our results show that tPA was up-regulated only in the acute phase of rejection (P < 0. 05), whereas PAI- 1 was induced and persistently expressed during the progressive phase of chronic rejection, together with persistent fibrin deposition in the grafts. Immunohistochemistry showed PAI- 1 was mainly localized to the damaged/proliferative vascular intima. The results suggest that persistent induction of PAI- 1 may be responsible for the continuance of fibrin deposition, which is associated with irreversible damage and chronic graft loss...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> {{activator}} is {{the only}} approved thrombolytic agent {{for the treatment of}} ischemic stroke. However, it carries the disadvantage of a 10 -fold increase in symptomatic and asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. A safer thrombolytic agent may improve patient prognosis and increase patient participation in thrombolytic treatment. A novel direct-acting thrombolytic agent, Δ(K 2 -K 5) plasmin, promising an improved safety profile was examined for safety in the snare ligature model of stroke in the rat. Methods Male spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to 6 hours middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 18 hours reflow. Beginning 1 minute before reflow, they were dosed with saline, vehicle, Δ(K 2 -K 5) plasmin (0. 15, 0. 5, 1. 5, and 5 [*]mg/kg) or recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (10 and 30 [*]mg/kg) by local intra-arterial infusion lasting 10 to 60 minutes. The rats were assessed for bleeding score, infarct volume, modified Bederson score and general behavioral score. In a parallel study, temporal progression of infarct volume was determined. In an in vitro study, whole blood clots from humans, canines and rats were exposed to Δ(K 2 -K 5). Clot lysis was monitored by absorbance at 280 [*]nm. Results The main focus of this study was intracranial hemorrhage safety. Δ(K 2 -K 5) plasmin treatment at the highest dose caused no more intracranial hemorrhage than the lowest dose of recombinant <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator, but showed at least a 5 -fold superior safety margin. Secondary results include: temporal infarct volume progression shows that the greatest expansion of infarct volume occurs within 2 – 3 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. A spike in infarct volume was observed at 6 hours ischemia with reflow. Δ(K 2 -K 5) plasmin tended to reduce infarct volume and improve behavior compared to controls. In vitro data suggests that Δ(K 2 -K 5) plasmin is equally effective at lysing clots from humans, canines and rats. Conclusions The superior intracranial hemorrhage safety profile of the direct-acting thrombolytic Δ(K 2 -K 5) plasmin compared with recombinant <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> activator makes this agent a good candidate for clinical evaluation in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. </p...|$|R

Although this is true for oral estrogen, transdermal estradiol has been found only to reduce PAI-1 and protein S, {{and to a lesser extent}} than oral estrogen. Due to its effects on liver {{protein synthesis}}, oral estrogen is procoagulant, and has been found to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Conversely, modern oral contraceptives are not associated with an increase in the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (heart attack) in healthy, non-smoking premenopausal women of any age, except in those with hypertension (high blood pressure). However, a small but significant increase in the risk of stroke, though not of myocardial infarction, has been found in menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy.
