30|$|Another {{possibility}} is that these different responses in ASIs and GIs may be attributed <b>to</b> the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> wavelengths used <b>to</b> observe the auroras. The <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> wavelength did not result <b>in</b> significant <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> {{the brightness of the}} poleward expansion. However, it may contribute <b>to</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the brightness of the AIB. Both satellite (170  nm) and ground (557.7  nm) images are expected to be sensitive to precipitating electrons in the keV range. Thus, the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> wavelength likely did not contribute significantly <b>to</b> the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> observed auroras if the onset was dominated by keV-range electrons. However, precipitating electrons may belong to other energy ranges for the AIB. In such cases, the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> wavelength may contribute to the different responses.|$|R

5|$|Following their {{respective}} breeding seasons, {{several species of}} hummingbirds occur at the same locations in North America, and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats. These flowers have converged to a common morphology and color because these are effective at attracting the birds. Different lengths and curvatures of the corolla tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation <b>to</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> bill morphology. Tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill {{in a particular way}} when probing the flower, especially when the bill and corolla are both curved. This allows the plant to place pollen on a certain part of the bird's body, permitting a variety of morphological co-adaptations.|$|E

During preparations for one of many cancelled operations, Linnete II, his disagreement with Brereton over a risky operation caused him to threaten resignation, which, due <b>to</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> military culture, Brereton regarded as tantamount to disobeying an order.
