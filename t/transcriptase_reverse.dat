5000|$|While {{studying}} the Rous sarcoma virus at UW-Madison, Temin began {{to refer to}} the genetic material that the virus introduced to the cells, the “provirus.” Using the antibiotic, actinomycin D, which inhibits the expression of DNA, he determined that the provirus was DNA or was located on the cell’s DNA., These results implied that the infecting Rous sarcoma virus was somehow generating complementary double-stranded DNA. Temin's description of how tumor viruses act on the genetic material of the cell through reverse transcription was revolutionary. This upset the widely held belief at the time of a popularized version of the [...] "Central Dogma" [...] of molecular biology posited by Nobel laureate Francis Crick, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA (along with James Watson and Rosalind Franklin). Crick had claimed only that sequence information cannot flow out of protein into DNA or RNA, but he was commonly interpreted as saying that information flows exclusively from DNA to RNA to protein. Many highly respected scientists disregarded his work and declared it impossible. Despite the lack of support from the scientific community, Temin continued to search for evidence to support his idea. In 1969, Temin and a postdoctoral fellow, Satoshi Mazutani, began searching for the enzyme that was responsible for the phenomenon of viral RNA being transferred into proviral DNA. Later that year, Temin showed that certain tumor viruses carried the enzymatic ability to reverse the flow of information from RNA back to DNA using reverse <b>transcriptase.</b> <b>Reverse</b> transcriptase was also independently and simultaneously discovered in association with the murine leukemia virus by David Baltimore at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

40|$|The {{hepadnavirus}} <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> binds cotranslationally to the viral pregenomic RNA. This ribonucleoprotein {{complex is}} then encapsidated into nascent viral core particles, where the <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> copies the viral RNA into DNA. Here {{we report that}} 75 % of the duck hepatitis B virus <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> present in transfected LMH cells does not follow this well-known pathway but rather exists in the cell separate from the core protein or nucleocapsids. The nonencapsidated <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> is also abundant in infected duck liver.

30|$|To {{explore the}} origin of these miRNAs in AMV <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase,</b> we traced their source back {{to the process of}} AMV <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> production. Currently, there are two primary methods used in <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> production; one method is to purify AMV <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> from avian {{myeloblastosis}} virus (AMV) particles isolating from the host plasma or cultured cells infected with AMV (Houts et al., 1979); another method is to purify the enzyme following recombinant expression in E. coli or other cells (for example, insect cells). Most commercial AMV <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> are produced using the first method. The AMV is used to infect chicks or other birds, after 7  days, AMV particles are purified from the host blood plasma. We checked the miRNA profile of chick plasma by RT-qPCR (Fig.  1 E). The miRNA profile for chick plasma was consistent with that of the <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase.</b> There were high concentrations of Let- 7 a, miR- 16, miR- 26 a and miR- 191 in chick plasma, and AMV <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> also exhibited high expression levels of these miRNAs (Fig.  1 E and 1 F). Our results suggest that the contaminated miRNA in AMV <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> might be derived from host plasma.

The virus species tested were Tomato spotted wilt virus, Tomato chlorotic spot virus, Groundnut ringspot virus, Chrysanthemum stem necrosis virus, Impatiens necrotic spot virus, Zucchini lethal chlorosis virus, Iris yellow spot virus. Primers for PCR amplification were designed to match conserved regions of the tospovirus genome. RT-PCR using distinct primer combinations was unable to simultaneously amplify all tospovirus species and consistently failed to detect ZLCV and IYSV in total RNA extracts. However, all tospovirus species were detected by RT-PCR when viral RNA was used as template. RNA-specific PCR products were used as probes for dot hybridization. This assay with a M probe (directed to the G 1 /G 2 gene) detected at low stringency conditions all Tospovirus species, except IYSV. At low stringency conditions, the L non-radioactive probe detected the seven Tospovirus species in a single assay. This method for broad spectrum detection can be potentially employed in quarantine services for indexing in vitro germplasm...|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were: (1) to describe the genetic variability of HIV strains found in Burkina Faso, (2) to characterize non-B HIV strains mutation profiles selected by ARVs and (3) to detect possible resistances induced by ARV drugs. From 30 October 2002 to 20 November 2003, 132 HIV 1 -positive patients taking Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) for more than one year in Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou were included. T-CD 4 + lymphocytes count was done using Dynabeads technique while genotypic test and ARV-resistance tests were conducted using Pol sequencing that codes for reverse <b>transcriptase</b> <b>reverse,</b> integrase and protease. Due to undetectable viremia, 86 samples out of 132 could not be characterized.

In addition, several mutations related to PI, NRTI and NNRTI resistance were isolated in 27 samples. This study found a huge genetic HIV- 1 polymorphism in Burkina Faso.

Ten histological normal surgical samples were retrieved for both the large and small bowel from patients with benign conditions and healthy tissue represented control collection. Sex and age in controls did not differ from CD group. Three endoscopic biopsy specimens taken after informed consent in subjects with normal colon were also used as negative controls. TNF-&#x 3 B 1;, syndecan 1 and bFGF were detected by both reverse <b>transcriptase</b> <b>reverse</b> transcriptase polymerase chain reaction after mRNA extraction (results expressed as fold-change) and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: TNF-&#x 3 B 1; did not show any significant difference between CD and control specimens (1. 54 1; 1. 19; P > 0. 05). Very high levels of bFGF were observed in CD (11. 76 1; 4. 65; P syndecan 1 > TNF-&#x 3 B 1; = control. Immunoreactivity for bFGF was observed in epithelial, stromal, endothelial cells and even in the muscular layer, whilst in normal tissue it was almost unexpressed. Syndecan 1 and TNF-&#x 3 B 1; staining was confined to mucosal epithelial and stromal cells, while in controls syndecan 1 was found in its normal site, i. e., basolateral area of the crypts and TNF-&#x 3 B 1; very poorly expressed.

40|$|Entry {{inhibitor}} is a {{new class}} of drugs that target the viral envelope protein. This region is variable; hence resistance to these drugs may be present before treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the frequency of patients failing treatment with <b>transcriptase</b> <b>reverse</b> and protease inhibitors that would respond to the entry inhibitors Enfuvirtide, Maraviroc, and BMS- 806. The study included 100 HIV- 1 positive patients from one outpatient clinic in the city of Sao Paulo, for whom a genotype test was requested due to treatment failure. Proviral DNA was amplified and sequenced for regions of gp 120 and gp 41. A total of 80 could be sequenced and from those, 73 (91. 3 %), 5 (6. 3 %) and 2 (2. 5 %) were classified as subtype B, F, and recombinants (B/F and B/C), respectively. CXCR 4 co-receptor use was predicted in 30 % of the strains. Primary resistance to Enfuvirtide was found in 1. 3 %, following the AIDS Society consensus list, and 10 % would be considered resistant if a broader criterion was used. Resistance to BMS- 806 was higher; 6 (7. 5 %), and was associated to non-B strains. Strikingly, 27. 5 % of samples harbored one or more mutation among A 316 T, I 323 V, and S 405 A, which have been related to decreased susceptibility of Maraviroc; 15 % of them among viruses predictive to be R 5. A more common mutation was A 316 T, which was associated to the Brazilian B strain harboring the GWGR motif at the tip of V 3 loop and their derivative sequences.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the hepatoprotective roles of (Z) - 5 -(4 -methoxybenzylidene) thiazolidine- 2, 4 -dione (SKLB 010) against carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) -induced acute and chronic liver injury and its underlying mechanisms of action. METHODS: In the first experiment, rats were weighed and randomly divided into 5 groups (five rats in each group) {{to assess the}} protective effect of SKLB 010 on acute liver injury. For induction of acute injury, rats were administered a single intraperitoneal injection of 2 mL/kg of 50 % (v/v) CCl 4 dissolved in olive oil (1 : 1). Group 1 was untreated and served as the control group; group 2 received CCl 4 for induction of liver injury and served as the model group. In groups 3, 4 and 5, rats receiving CCl 4 were also treated with SKLB 010 at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively. Blood samples were collected at 6, 12 and 24 h after CCl 4 intoxication to determine the serum activity of alanine amino transferase. Tumour necrosis factor-&#x 3 B 1; (TNF-&#x 3 B 1;), interleukin- 1 &#x 3 B 2; (IL- 1 &#x 3 B 2;) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. At 24 h after CCl 4 injection,liver fibrogenesis was evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical analyses. Cytokine transcript levels of TNF-&#x 3 B 1;, IL- 1 &#x 3 B 2; and inducible nitric oxide synthase in the liver tissues of rats were measured using a reverse <b>transcriptase</b> <b>reverse</b> transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique. In the second experiment, rats were randomly divided into 2 groups (15 rats in each group), and liver injury in the CCl 4 -administered groups was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of 2 mL/kg of 50 % (v/v) CCl 4 dissolved in olive oil (1 : 1). The SKLB 010 -treated groups received oral 100 mg/kg SKLB 010 before CCl 4 administration. Five rats in each group were sacrificed at 2 h, 6 h, 12 h after CCl 4 intoxication and small fortions of livers were rapidly frozen for extraction of total RNA, hepatic proteins and glutathione (GSH) assays. In the hepatic fibrosis model group, rats were randomly divided into 2 groups (5 rats each group). Rats were injected intraperitoneally {{with a mixture of}} CCl 4 (1 mL/kg body weight) and olive oil [1 : 1 (v/v) ] twice a week for 4 wk. In the SKLB 010 -treated groups, SKLB 010 (100 mg/kg) was given once daily by oral gavage for 4 wk after CCl 4 administration. The rats were sacrificed one week after the last injection and the livers from each group were harvested and fixed in 10 % formalin for HE and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: In this rat acute liver injury model, oral administration of SKLB 010 blocked liver tissue injury by down-regulating the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, suppressing inflammatory infiltration to liver tissue, and improving the histological architecture of liver. SKLB 010 inhibited the activation of NF-&#x 3 BA;B by suppressing the degradation of I&#x 3 BA;B, and prevented the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x 3 B 1;, interleukin- 1 &#x 3 B 2;, and the reactive free radical, nitric oxide, at the transcriptional and translational levels. In this chronic liver fibrosis model, treatment with 100 mg/kg per day SKLB 010 attenuated the degree of hepatic fibrosis and area of collagen, and blocked the accumulation of smooth-muscle actin-expressed cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SKLB 010 is a potent therapeutic agent for the treatment of CCl 4 -induced hepatic injury...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the separation and purification of a <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> and cellular DNA polymerases {{from the human}} spleen of a patient with myelofibrotic syndrome. The specific requirements with respect to bivalent cations and template-primers for DNA polymerase-alpha, DNA polymerase-beta and DNA polymerase-gamma, {{as well as for}} the <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase,</b> are reported. Sedimentation-velocity measurements of the purified enzymes gave values of 150000, 40000, 100000 and 70000 daltons for DNA polymerase-alpha DNA polymerase-beta, DNA polymerase-gamma and the <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> respectively. Serological studies have shown that the <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> from human spleen is not antigenically related to cellular DNA polymerase-alpha, -beta or -gamma, but is antigenically related to <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> from simian sarcoma virus and gibbon-ape leukaemia virus...|$|R
50|$|Elvucitabine {{belongs to}} a class (group) of HIV drugs called {{nucleoside}} <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> inhibitors (NRTIs). NRTIs block an HIV enzyme called <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase.</b> (An enzyme is a protein that starts or increases {{the speed of a}} chemical reaction). By blocking <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase,</b> NRTIs prevent HIV from multiplying and can reduce the amount of HIV in the body.|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the new low-cost ExaVir Load (version 3) <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> viral load assay against the Roche Cobas Amplicor assay. Results for samples tested using the <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> assay correlated well with those obtained with the Roche assay (r = 0. 85; n = 202). The version 3 <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> assay shows improved sensitivity {{compared to the}} previous version...|$|R
40|$|The {{organization}} of the murine leukemia virus (MuLV) pol gene was investigated by expressing molecular clones containing AKR MuLV <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> or endonuclease or both gene segments in Escherichia coli and generating specific antisera against the expressed bacterial proteins. Reaction of these antisera with detergent-disrupted virus precipitated an 80 -kilodalton (kDa) protein, the MuLV <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase,</b> and a 46 -kDa protein which we believe is the viral endonuclease. A third (50 -kDa) protein, related to <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase,</b> was also precipitated. Bacterial extracts of clones expressing <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> and endonuclease sequences competed with the viral 80 - and 46 -kDa proteins, respectively. These results demonstrate that the antisera are specific for viral <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> and endonuclease. Immunoprecipitation of AKR MuLV with antisera prepared against a bacterial protein containing only endonuclease sequences led to the observation that <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> and endonuclease can be associated as a complex involving a disulfide bond(s) ...|$|R
25|$|An {{improved}} {{knowledge of}} the action of <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> has led to better nucleoside analogues to treat HIV infections. One of these drugs, lamivudine, has been approved to treat hepatitis B, which uses <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> {{as part of its}} replication process. Researchers have gone further and developed inhibitors that do not look like nucleosides, but can still block <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{fidelity}} of DNA synthesis by <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> {{from human}} immunodeficiency virus and other retroviruses was compared by measuring the rates of misincorporation of dCMP {{in the place of}} TMP in cell-free DNA synthesis with polyadenylic acid as the template. The fidelity of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> was found to be about one-third of that of the <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptases</b> of other retroviruses...|$|R
50|$|In contrast, NNRTIs have a {{completely}} different mode of action. NNRTIs block <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> by binding directly to the enzyme. NNRTIs are not incorporated into the viral DNA like NRTIs, but instead inhibit the movement of protein domains of <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase</b> that are needed {{to carry out the}} process of DNA synthesis. NNRTIs are therefore classified as non-competitive inhibitors of <b>reverse</b> <b>transcriptase.</b>|$|R
