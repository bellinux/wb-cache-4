5|$|In 2008 Congress {{directed}} Amtrak {{to study}} resumption of service, which rekindled hope of restoration. Amtrak published a feasibility study in October 2009, which proposed restoring the North Coast Hiawatha to its 1979 route where possible with a daily schedule. Amtrak projected a yearly ridership of 359,800, {{some of whom}} would {{be drawn from the}} Empire Builder. Amtrak estimated that $1 billion in funds would be necessary to relaunch the service, including over $300 million for new locomotives and rolling stock. The corporation estimated it would <b>take</b> <b>four</b> to five years to reintroduce the service if a decision was made to move forward.|$|E

5|$|Operation Southern Move was to {{be carried}} out in two stages. The first stage {{involved}} the capture of Mrkonjić Grad and the surrounding Podrašnica Valley. In {{the second phase of the}} operation, the force would seize the last significant source of electricity in the VRS-controlled part of western Bosnia and Herzegovina—the Bočac Hydroelectric Power Station. The whole operation was planned to <b>take</b> <b>four</b> days, immediately preceding a country-wide ceasefire scheduled to take effect on the morning of 12 October 1995. According to Brigadier Ante Kotromanović, then commander of the 126th Home Guard Regiment, the offensive was approved by the United States, and U.S. warplanes attacked VRS positions near Banja Luka in preparation of the offensive.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{cost for}} {{reconstruction}} {{was estimated at}} $2.5billion, which was estimated to <b>take</b> <b>four</b> years. The cost for repairing the damaged houses was estimated at $484.8million. Following the storm, workers made emergency repairs to the destroyed bridges and roads. The cost for rebuilding roads was higher than their damage cost due to planning for future flooding. Within a month, there were repairs to the power grid {{to a level of}} 550MW, or 91.7% of what it was before Mitch struck. Water companies restored water to 60% of Tegucigalpa within a month of the storm striking.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} initially {{opposed the}} Swedish reforms, {{as can be}} ascertained from church records and court transcripts. The Swedes did encounter civil revolts in many areas, including the Göinge district, in dense forest regions of northern Scania. The Swedish authorities resorted to extreme measures against the 17th-century rebels who were described as snapphanar, a term used for raiding enemy soldiers or bandits.. The punishments included the use of impalement breaking on the wheel, {{as well as the}} nailing of bodies to church doors. In that way, it could <b>take</b> <b>four</b> to five days before the victim died.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the typhoon, the Pacific Air Forces were on standby to deliver supplies to Guam, but were delayed by inoperable airstrips. Guam Memorial Hospital was damaged, but other civilian and military installations, including the Navy's hospital, were able to handle injured persons. On November12, Manuel Guerrero made an urgent appeal to the Government of the United States requesting that aid be rushed to the territory. Additionally, he instituted an island-wide curfew between 8:00p.m. and 6:00a.m. local time to limit looting. At schools, teachers were called in to guard supplies and equipment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, under orders from United States President John F. Kennedy, declared Guam a major disaster area later that day, allowing residents to receive federal aid. Additionally, 15 United States Air Force communications technicians were deployed from Manila, Philippines carrying three plane-loads of communication supplies. Guerrero estimated that it would <b>take</b> <b>four</b> months to complete repairs to utilities. It was also estimated that schools on the island would be closed for six months.|$|E

5|$|The reforms, {{especially}} the decentralization of administrative authority, were not received well by the Soviets, who, after failed negotiations, sent {{half a million}} Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country. New York Times cites reports of 650,000 men equipped with the most modern and sophisticated weapons in the Soviet military catalogue. A large wave of emigration swept the nation. A spirited non-violent resistance was mounted throughout the country, involving attempted fraternization, painting over and turning street signs (on one occasion an entire invasion force from Poland was routed {{back out of the}} country after a day's wandering), defiance of various curfews, etc. While the Soviet military had predicted that it would <b>take</b> <b>four</b> days to subdue the country the resistance held out for eight months, and was only circumvented by diplomatic stratagems (see below). There were sporadic acts of violence and several suicides by self-immolation (such as that of Jan Palach), but there was no military resistance. Czechoslovakia remained Soviet-controlled until 1989, when the Velvet Revolution ended pro-Soviet rule peacefully, undoubtedly drawing upon the successes of the non-violent resistance twenty years earlier. The resistance also became an iconic example of civilian-based defense, which, along with unarmed civilian peacekeeping constitute the two ways that nonviolence can be and occasionally has been applied directly to military or paramilitary threats.|$|E
