5|$|Although Hogg spent {{little time}} at the Varner {{plantation}} after Bayou Bend was constructed, she continued to purchase art and antique furniture on its behalf. In the 1950s, she restored the plantation, and each room was given a different theme from Texas history: colonial times, the Confederacy, Napoleonic times (1818), and the Mexican–American War. One room was dedicated to her father, and contained his desk and chair {{as well as his}} collection of walking sticks. She donated the property <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> it was dedicated as the Varner–Hogg Plantation State Historical Site in 1958, the 107th anniversary of Jim Hogg's birth.|$|E
5|$|He donated his parents' house, Osborne on the Isle of Wight, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> {{continued}} to live at Sandringham. He could afford to be magnanimous; his private secretary, Sir Francis Knollys, claimed {{that he was the}} first heir to succeed to the throne in credit. Edward's finances had been ably managed by Sir Dighton Probyn, Comptroller of the Household, and had benefited from advice from Edward's Jewish financier friends, such as Ernest Cassel, Maurice de Hirsch and the Rothschild family. At a time of widespread anti-Semitism, Edward attracted criticism for openly socialising with Jews.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, when India gained independence, {{the state}} of West Bengal was formed with 14 districts, as per {{partition}} plan of the then Bengal province of British India. The former princely state Koch Bihar joined as a district in 1950, and the former French enclave Chandannagore joined {{as part of the}} Hooghly district in 1954. The States Reorganisation Act of 1956 led to addition of Purulia district <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> to enlargement of West Dinajpur district. Later, larger districts such as West Dinajpur, 24 Parganas and Midnapore were bifurcated. Till 24 June 2014 West Bengal was divided into 19 districts.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian {{administration}} of Queen Maud Land {{is controlled by}} the Polar Affairs Department of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, located in Oslo. The annexation of the territory is regulated by the Dependency Act of 24 March 1933; Queen Maud Land was added on 21 June 1957.

5|$|The castle was {{attacked}} during the Madog ap Llywelyn revolt of 1294, the Llywelyn Bren uprising in 1316 {{and during the}} overthrow of Edward II in 1326–27. In the late 15th century, however, it fell into decline and by the 16th century the lakes had drained away and the walls were robbed of their stone. The Marquesses of Bute acquired the property in 1776 and under {{the third and fourth}} Marquesses extensive restoration took place. In 1950 the castle and grounds were given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> the water defences were re-flooded. In the 21st century, the Welsh heritage agency Cadw manages the site as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} campaigning abroad by Rome, and the rewarding {{of soldiers}} with plunder from those campaigns, {{led to the}} trend of soldiers becoming increasingly loyal to their commanders rather than <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> a willingness to follow their generals in battle against the state. Rome was plagued by several slave uprisings during this period, in part because {{in the past century}} vast tracts of land had been given to veterans who farmed by use of slaves and who came to greatly outnumber their Roman masters. In the last century BC, at least twelve civil wars and rebellions occurred. This pattern did not break until Octavian (later Caesar Augustus) ended it by becoming a successful challenger to the Senate's authority, and was made princeps (emperor).|$|E
5|$|The state {{government}} {{have tried to}} proposed a new ferry terminal in the town to attract more tourist particularly from the Philippines and also from Indonesia. But the proposal was turned down due to the trouble in the southern Philippines which could spread <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> there is {{a call from the}} former Chief Minister of Sabah and the Current President of Sabah Progressive Party Yong Teck Lee to suspend the ferry service to counter the high level of people migration from the Philippines which now has become the major problem to Sabah as they are overstaying in the state and becoming an illegal immigrants.|$|E
50|$|During {{the tumultuous}} debate {{concerning}} {{ratification of the}} federal Constitution in 1787, Roane advocated ratification, {{on the condition of}} adding a bill of rights because the document as drafted did not clarify powers reserved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> people.|$|R
50|$|Castiglioni {{grew up in}} Trieste, Italy. In 1939, he emigrated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> {{became a}} {{professor}} at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.

5|$|This {{included}} the planting of Pinot noir grapes in the Willamette Valley, a region long thought {{too cold to}} be suitable for viticulture. In the 1970s, more out-of-state winemakers migrated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> started to organize as an industry. The state's land use laws had prevented rural hillsides from being turned into housing tracts, preserving {{a significant amount of}} land suitable for vineyards. In 1979, The Eyrie Vineyards entered a 1975 Pinot noir in the Wine Olympics; the wine was rated among the top Pinots in the world, thus gaining the region its first international recognition.|$|E
5|$|Under the Ayyubids, {{numerous}} Arab emirs {{held the}} post {{at any given}} time and were endowed with iqtaʿat. However, with the onset of Mamluk rule in Syria in 1260, it became a hereditary office consolidated by members of the Al Fadl dynasty, direct descendants of the Tayyid clan of Banu Jarrah. The office remained in the household of the Al Fadl emir, Isa ibn Muhanna, with occasional interruption, well into the early Ottoman era, during which Isa's descendants took over leadership of the Mawali tribe. Under the Ottomans, the role of the amir al-ʿarab appeared centered on providing camels <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> guarding the Hajj pilgrim caravan in return for annual payments.|$|E
5|$|After {{a decade}} out of politics, Willis was chosen without {{opposition}} as the Republican gubernatorial nominee in 1943. Infighting among the state's Democrats combined with Willis's popular proposal {{to eliminate the}} state income tax carried him to a narrow victory over J. Lyter Donaldson. Willis was opposed by Democratic majorities {{in both houses of}} the Kentucky General Assembly. The end of World War II in 1945 brought sizable budget surpluses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> disagreements over how to spend the excess funds spilled over into special legislative sessions. Willis was not able to realize his campaign promise of eliminating the state income tax because the legislature expanded the budget far beyond what he proposed. Nevertheless, he was able to forge a record of modest accomplishments, including constructing five tuberculosis hospitals across the state and significantly increasing funding for education. Following his term as governor, he served on various state boards and commissions, but failed in his only attempt to return to elective officea 1952 campaign against Bert T. Combs to return to the Court of Appeals. Willis died on April 1, 1965, and is interred at Frankfort Cemetery in the capital city of Frankfort.|$|E
50|$|From 5 September to 18 November, Oneida {{distributed}} occupation forces {{throughout the}} Far East, from Hollandia to Korea and China. From 18 November 1945 to 16 June 1946, Oneida participated in Operation Magic Carpet, returning veterans <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> taking replacements overseas for occupation duty.|$|R
50|$|Hall {{was wounded}} on Guadalcanal in November 1942, but {{recovered}} {{to lead his}} battalion in the final battles {{for control of the}} island. He subsequently returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> trained troops in jungle combat. He retired from the Army {{at the end of the}} war.|$|R
50|$|By {{this time}} Bennett {{had had enough}} and, in a meeting in April, Merton and his {{guardian}} appear to have struck a deal: Merton would return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> Bennett would not tell Merton's grandparents about his indiscretions. In May Merton left Cambridge after completing his exams.|$|R
5|$|Clements {{also created}} or reorganized several {{government}} agencies. In cooperation with Pennsylvania governor James H. Duff, {{he created the}} Ohio River Sanitation Commission (ORANSCO) to combat pollution in the Ohio River and its tributaries. He curbed fraud in the insurance industry by reorganizing the state Insurance Commission and hiring a national prominent expert to rewrite the state's entire insurance code. To assist the General Assembly in writing more effective and efficient legislation, Clements created the non-partisan Legislative Research Commission, stocked with professionals from various disciplines, to conduct governmental research. He created the Kentucky Agriculture and Industrial Board (the predecessor of the current Kentucky Department of Commerce), which attracted 250 new industries <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> created 40,000 new jobs during its first three years. He also created the Kentucky Building Commission to manage and plan all new state buildings. Among the commission's first projects were a new $6million capitol annex {{and the construction of}} a new state fairgrounds. To retain the most qualified government employees, he supported a constitutional amendment that quadrupled the minimum annual salary for state employees from $5,000 to $20,000.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the Louisiana Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness {{activated}} its Crisis Action Team on August 16 {{to monitor}} the storm and coordinate preparation. Governor of Louisiana Kathleen Blanco {{declared a state of}} emergency early on the evening of August 17, asking for a presidential emergency declaration to give Louisiana access to federal funds prior to any landfall. Texas Governor Rick Perry declared Dean to be an imminent threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> thus initiated a full-scale hurricane preparedness effort on August 17 when the storm was at least five days away. Prior to the storm, Texas suffered severe flooding from several June–July storms, and Tropical Storm Erin left the ground still saturated. Governor Perry feared that more rainfall from Dean would cause additional flash flooding, and had 250 Texas Parks and Wildlife Department crews on standby with boats to assist in potential evacuations. He was willing to deploy up to 10,000 Texas Military Forces soldiers, and did deploy several elements of the Texas State Guard who set up emergency shelters. The Texas fuel industry began surging fuel loads to coastal counties to ensure adequate fuel in the event of the hurricane causing a disruption to the fuel distribution system. In anticipation of evacuations, the Texas Department of Transportation began working on extra evacuation lanes and contraflow. NASA cut short the STS-118 mission as a precaution, in case Dean approached Mission Control at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. To that effect, mission managers cut the mission's final spacewalk short by two hours, allowing them to land a day earlier than originally planned.|$|E
5|$|Little {{progress}} {{had been}} made on the memorial by 1926. While some debate occurred in respect to the form that the memorial would take, {{the focus of the}} discussions concerned the location of the memorial, and this centred on the future of Government House {{and the role of the}} Governor. A number of left-wing politicians argued that the grounds of Government House should be turned over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> used to build the memorial while the conservatives desired to retain the status quo. By 1925 the National War Memorial committee was prepared to accept the Government House grounds as the site of the memorial, but they delayed making an announcement. This proved to be fortuitous, as legal issues prevented the plan from going ahead. Instead a portion of the grounds, located at the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue, was put aside for the purpose. (The plan to move the Governor and to use the grounds as part of a larger war memorial were revisited, over 80 years later, in 2007).|$|E
5|$|Because the Bill of Rights did not {{initially}} apply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> <b>and</b> federal criminal investigations were less {{common in the}} first century of the nation's history, there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century. The amendment was held <b>to</b> apply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> in Mapp v. Ohio (1961).|$|R
