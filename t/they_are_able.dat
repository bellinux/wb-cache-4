5|$|The Athsheans {{perceive}} the Terrans as an insane people, {{partly because of}} the disconnect amongst the Terrans between conscious, rational thinking and subconscious drives. The Terrans frequent use of hallucinogens is seen as the closest <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to get to understanding their own subconscious. The psychological equilibrium which their dreaming gives the Athsheans is portrayed as the reason why <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to live in balance with their ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> {{to track}} the Trident to its resting place. Though Salazar nearly kills Jack, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to destroy the Trident. With the {{destruction}} of the Trident, Salazar and his crew become mortal again. Jack, Henry and Carina escape as Barbossa sacrifices himself to kill Salazar. Despite their differences, Jack mourns Barbossa's death. Later, Jack watches Will and Elizabeth's reunion before he departs, the Black Pearl and his compass once again in his possession.|$|E

5|$|Increasing sea {{temperatures}} in tropical regions (~1 degree C) {{the last century}} have caused major coral bleaching, death, and therefore shrinking coral populations since although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to adapt and acclimate, it is uncertain if this evolutionary process will happen quickly enough to prevent major reduction of their numbers.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} intention is critical to joint attention. When individuals understand that others have goals, intentions, and attentional states, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to enter into and direct another's attention. Joint attention promotes and maintains dyadic exchanges and learning {{about the nature of}} social partners. The ability to engage in joint attention is crucial for language development.|$|E

5|$|While {{induction}} {{entails the}} transient activation of CaMKII and PKC, maintenance of E-LTP (early-form LTP) {{is characterized by}} their persistent activation. During this stage, PKMz (Protein kinase Mζ) which does not have dependence on calcium, become autonomously active. Consequently, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> {{to carry out the}} phosphorylation events that underlie E-LTP expression.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels are cavity nesters, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> {{to adapt}} {{to a wide variety of}} nesting situations. They {{generally}} prefer natural cavities (such as in trees) with closed tops and tight fitting entrances, as to provide for maximum protection of the eggs and young. Kestrels occasionally nest in holes created by large woodpeckers, or use the abandoned nests of other birds, such as red-tailed hawks, merlins, and crows. They have been recorded nesting on cliff ledges and building tops, as well as in abandoned cavities in cactuses. American kestrels also commonly utilize nesting boxes.|$|E
5|$|As in ski jumping, team {{competitions}} {{are often}} included at ski flying events.

There can be upwards of eight teams from different countries, providing <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to field a full team of four.|$|E
40|$|The aims of this {{research}} was to describe the characteristics of reflective thinking process of the students in Grade VII of State Junior Secondary School 3 of Polanharjo Klaten who have the high, moderate, and low abilities in solving fractional problems. This research used qualitative case study approach. The data of research were gathered through task-based in-depth interview. The results of research were the characteristics of reflective thinking process of the students as follows: 1) The students with the high initial ability in Mathematics: (a) in the problem understanding phase, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to mention information of the problems and to explain what has been done; (b) in the problem-solving planning phase, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to identify the concept of the problems and to explain what has been done; (c) in the implementation of problem-solving plan phase, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to realize the mistakes and to fix them, to examine the truth of an argument, to employ the internal knowledge, to relate the information that they have known, and to communicate ideas with symbols instead of pictures or direct objects; and (d) in the reexamination phase, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to draw conclusions to return the answers back into the contexts and to explain what has been done. 2) The students with the moderate initial ability in Mathematics: (a) in the problem understanding phase, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to mention information of the problems and to explain what has been done; (b) in the problem-solving planning phase, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to identify the concept of the problems, to employ the internal knowledge, to relate the information that they have known, and to explain what has been done; (c) in the implementation of problem-solving plan phase, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unable to do reflective thinking; (d) in the reexamination phase, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to draw conclusions to return the answers back into the contexts and to explain what has been done. 3) The students with the low initial ability in Mathematics <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to do reflective thinking merely on the problem understanding phase, with the following characteristics: <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to mention information of the problems and to explain what has been done...|$|R

5|$|Athletes will {{sometimes}} become citizens {{of a different}} nation so <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> {{to compete in the}} Olympics. This is often because they are drawn to sponsorships or training facilities in such places as the United States. It could also be because an athlete is unable to qualify from within their original country. The athlete may not qualify because there are already qualified athletes in the athlete's home country. Between 1992 and 2008, about fifty athletes emigrated to the United States to compete on the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation.|$|E
5|$|Because adult great spotted kiwis {{are large}} and powerful, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to fend off most predators that attack them, such as stoats, ferrets, weasels, pigs, brush possums and cats, {{all of which are}} {{invasive}} species in New Zealand. However, dogs are able to kill even adults. Stoats, ferrets, possums, cats and dogs will feed on the eggs and chicks, meaning most chicks die within their first five months of life. Before the arrival of mammalian predators, the great spotted kiwi's natural predators would have been birds of prey like the extinct Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier and the extant Swamp harrier.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} varies {{during the}} lifespan of an individual. Researchers have more specifically described cognitive flexibility as {{the capacity to}} shift or switch one’s thinking and attention between different tasks or operations typically {{in response to a}} change in rules or demands. For example, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to successfully switch from sorting cards based on the color of the object to sorting based on the type of object on the card.|$|E

The group is cornered by the raptors, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to escape when the Tyrannosaurus suddenly appears and kills the raptors. Hammond arrives in a Jeep with Malcolm, and the entire group boards a helicopter to leave the island.|$|E
5|$|In 2036, FBI Agents Simon Foster (Henry Ian Cusick) and Henrietta 'Etta' Bishop (Georgina Haig) {{recover the}} body of Walter Bishop (John Noble), Walter having purposefully encased himself and his team in amber shortly after the Observer takeover. Though <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to release him from the amber, they find that he has {{suffered}} memory damage and lacks the mental capacity to build a strange device of his own design. Simon and Etta talk to Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), learning that Walter had William Bell remove {{a piece of his}} brain some time in the past, which she postulates could be used to heal Walter's brain now. However, the piece is still in storage in the old Massive Dynamic facility on the main island of New York City, tightly controlled by Observers who can read their thoughts, making its recovery difficult. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> {{to make it to the}} vault in Massive Dynamic, in part due to the inability of the Observers to read Etta's mind, and successfully restore Walter's memories. They are, however, unaware that they have alerted Fringe division—still led by Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick)—and the Observers to their presence; a coordinated team, instructed to shoot on sight, is dispatched.|$|E
