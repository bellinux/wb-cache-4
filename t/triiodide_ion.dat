After a short time, the electrochemical reactions deplete the concentration of <b>triiodide</b> <b>ions</b> I3− at the cathode and enrich it at the anode, creating a concentration gradient of I3− between the electrodes. When the cell is motionless, the electrochemical reaction is limited by the diffusion of I3− to the cathode (a slow process), and the current dies down to a low steady-state value.|$|R

In the present work, more detailed TiCl 4 treated surface conditions on FTO substrate were investigated and DSSC per-formances were correlated with the surface morphology as well as dark current behavior...|$|R

5000|$|Iodine, however, is {{minimally}} soluble {{in water}} (0.03 g/100 g water at 20 °C) and does not react with it. [...] However, iodine will form an aqueous solution {{in the presence of}} iodide ion, such as by addition of potassium iodide (KI), because the <b>triiodide</b> <b>ion</b> is formed.|$|E
5000|$|When the {{solutions}} are mixed, the second reaction causes the <b>triiodide</b> <b>ion</b> {{to be consumed}} much faster than it is generated, and {{only a small amount}} of triiodide is present in the dynamic equilibrium.

40|$|The {{enhancement}} of sonochemical-reaction efficiency by pulsed ultrasound at 152 kHz {{has been studied}} experimentally through absorbance measurements of <b>triiodide</b> <b>ions</b> from sonochemical oxidation of potassium iodide at different liquid volumes to determine sonochemical efficiency defined by reacted molecules per input ultrasonic energy. The mechanism for {{enhancement of}} the reaction efficiency by pulsed ultrasound is discussed using captured images of sonochemiluminescence (SCL), and measured time-resolved signals of the SCL pulses and pressure amplitudes. The high sonochemical-reaction efficiency by pulsed ultrasound, compared with that by continuous-wave ultrasound, is attributed both to the residual pressure amplitude during the pulse-off time and to the spatial enlargement of active reaction sites...|$|R
50|$|The {{thallium}} trihalides {{are less}} stable than their corresponding aluminium, gallium and indium counterparts and chemically quite distinct.

5|$|Elemental iodine is {{slightly}} soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450ml at 20°C and 1280ml at 50°C; potassium iodide may {{be added to}} increase solubility via formation of <b>triiodide</b> <b>ions,</b> among other polyiodides. Nonpolar solvents such as hexane and carbon tetrachloride provide a higher solubility. Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as Lewis bases; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapour. Charge-transfer complexes form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour. Iodine is violet when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and saturated hydrocarbons but deep brown in alcohols and amines, solvents that form charge-transfer adducts.|$|R
5000|$|In chemistry, triiodide {{is usually}} {{referred}} to the <b>triiodide</b> <b>ion,</b> [...] This anion, one of the polyhalogen ions, is composed of three iodine atoms. It is formed by combining aqueous solutions of iodide salts and iodine. Some salts of the anion have been isolated, including thallium(I) triiodide (Tl+I3−) and ammonium triiodide (NH4+I3−). Triiodide is observed to be a red colour in solution.|$|E
5000|$|Linear {{geometry}} also {{occurs in}} AX2E3 molecules, such as xenon difluoride (XeF2) and the <b>triiodide</b> <b>ion</b> (...) with one iodide bonded {{to the two}} others. As described by the VSEPR model, the five valence electron pairs on the central atom form a trigonal bipyramid in which the three lone pairs occupy the less crowded equatorial positions and the two bonded atoms occupy the two axial positions at the opposite ends of an axis, forming a linear molecule.|$|E
50|$|Some redox titrations do {{not require}} an indicator, due to the intense color of the constituents. For instance, in permanganometry a slight {{persisting}} pink color signals the endpoint of the titration {{because of the color}} of the excess oxidizing agent potassium permanganate. In iodometry, at sufficiently large concentrations, the disappearance of the deep red-brown <b>triiodide</b> <b>ion</b> can itself be used as an endpoint, though at lower concentrations sensitivity is improved by adding starch indicator, which forms an intensely blue complex with triiodide.|$|E
40|$|In dye-sensitized nanocrystalline {{solar cells}} (DSC), the {{transfer}} of electrons from the conducting glass substrate to <b>triiodide</b> <b>ions</b> in solution is an important loss mechanism that can be suppressed by using thin compact blocking layers of TiO 2, Whereas back-reaction at the substrate is relatively unimportant under short circuit conditions, it {{must be taken into}} account at the maximum power point or at open circuit. The influence of the back-reaction on open circuit photovoltage decay measurements and on intensity modulated photovoltage (IMVS) measurements has been studied by model simulations and by experimental measurements. The simulations demonstrate that reliable information about DSC properties such as trapping distributions can only be derived from transient or periodic photovoltage responses if the back-reaction is suppressed by the use of suitable blocking layers...|$|R
30|$|Dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} (DSCs) have {{attracted}} great attention for their low cost, simple production, and acceptable {{energy conversion efficiency}} [1, 2]. It typically consists of three parts: a dye-sensitized oxide layer, electrolyte, and a counter electrode (CE). As {{an important component of}} DSCs, the CE transfers the electrons from the external circuit to the internal electrolyte and thus reduces <b>triiodide</b> <b>ions</b> to iodide ions, which realizes the continuous operation of DSCs and greatly influences the photovoltaic performance of DSCs. For achieving the high performance of DSCs, the CEs should possess high conductivity and catalytic activity [3]. High catalytic active platinized fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) is the most commonly used CE in DSCs. However, the high cost of scarce Pt limits the large-scale fabrication and application of DSCs, which promotes the exploration of Pt-free CEs [3 - 5].|$|R
50|$|A hypervalent {{molecule}} (the {{phenomenon is}} sometimes colloquially known as expanded octet) is a molecule that contains {{one or more}} main group elements apparently bearing more than eight electrons in their valence shells. Phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), the chlorite (ClO2−) <b>ion,</b> and the <b>triiodide</b> (I3−) <b>ion</b> are examples of hypervalent molecules.|$|R
5000|$|Calculations {{show that}} the {{additional}} electron {{is located in the}} aluminium cluster at the location directly opposite from the iodine atom. The cluster must therefore have a higher electron affinity for the electron than iodine and therefore the aluminium cluster is called a superhalogen (i.e., the vertical electron detachment energies of the moieties that make up the negative ions are larger than those of any halogen atom). The cluster component in the [...] ion is similar to an iodide ion or a bromide ion. The related [...] cluster is expected to behave chemically like the <b>triiodide</b> <b>ion.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The seesaw {{molecular}} geometry {{is found}} in sulfur tetrafluoride (SF4) with a central sulfur atom surrounded by four fluorines occupying two axial and two equatorial positions, {{as well as one}} equatorial lone pair, corresponding to an AX4E molecule in the AXE notation. A T-shaped molecular geometry {{is found in}} chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), an AX3E2 molecule with fluorines in two axial and one equatorial position, as well as two equatorial lone pairs. Finally, the <b>triiodide</b> <b>ion</b> (...) is also based upon a trigonal bipyramid, but the actual molecular geometry is linear with terminal iodines in the two axial positions only and the three equatorial positions filled with lone pairs of electrons (AX2E3).|$|E
5000|$|Other {{chemical}} compounds with [...] "triiodide" [...] in their name may contain three iodide centers {{that are not}} bonded {{to each other as}} the <b>triiodide</b> <b>ion,</b> but exist instead as separate iodine atoms or iodide ions. Examples include nitrogen triiodide (NI3) and phosphorus triiodide (PI3), where individual iodines are covalently bonded to a central atom. As some cations have the theoretical possibility to form compounds with both triiodide and iodide ions, such as ammonium, compounds containing iodide anions in a 3:1 stoichiometric ratio should only be referred to as triiodides in cases where the triiodide anion is present. It may also be helpful to indicate the oxidation number of a metal cation, where appropriate. For example, the covalent molecule gallium triiodide (Ga2I6) is better referred to as gallium(III) iodide to emphasise that it is iodide anions that are present, and not triiodide.|$|E
40|$|A novel type of dye-sensitized cell (DSC) with a {{passivated}} titanium {{sensor electrode}} located {{on top of}} the nanocrystalline titanium dioxide layer has been used to study the temperature dependence of the electron quasi-Fermi level relative to the I- 3 (-) /I- redox-Fermi level under short circuit conditions. The results show that the Fermi level decreases with increasing temperature (- 1. 76 meV K- 1) as predicted for diffusive electron transport at short circuit. A smaller temperature dependence (- 0. 25 meV K- 1) of the position of the TiO 2 conduction band relative to the I- 3 (-) /I- redox-Fermi level was deduced from the shifts in the trap distribution. An expression for the temperature dependence of the open circuit voltage, Uphoto, has been derived. The experimentally observed temperature dependence of U-photo gave values of the activation energy (0. 25 eV) and preexponential factor (10 (8) s(- 1)) for the transfer of electrons from the conduction band of the nanocrystalline TiO 2 to <b>triiodide</b> <b>ions...</b>|$|R
30|$|Dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} (DSSCs) have {{attracted}} much attention {{in the last two}} decades since reported for the first time by Gratzel [1]. Attempts are ongoing to increase the adsorption of dyes across the solar spectrum, smoothen the function of the transport of photoexcited electrons, and encourage the diffusion of electrolyte ions. The process involves the injection of electrons from the photoexcited dye into the conduction band of the semiconductor oxide (TiO 2), from where they pass through the transparent conducting fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) current collector and finally into the external circuit. Furthermore, the sensitizer is regenerated by electron transfer from a donor, typically iodide ions, which are dissolved in the electrolyte present in the porous semiconductor. The <b>triiodide</b> <b>ions</b> formed during the reaction diffuse to the counter electrode, where they are reduced back to iodide by the conduction band electrons that have passed though the external circuit that performs the electrical work.|$|R
40|$|The {{photovoltaic}} {{performance and}} charge recombination characteristics of porphyrin-based {{dye-sensitized solar cell}} (DSC) devices have been investigated using the impedance spectroscopy (IS) technique. The IS results provide key information related to the device performance for a highly efficient porphyrin dye (YD 2), a reference porphyrin dye (YD 0), and a commercial ruthenium dye (N 719). The DSC devices constructed using YD 2 and N 719 dyes reach similar internal power conversion efficiencies (7. 41 % vs 7. 54 %) due to the higher injection of the YD 2 dye that is compromised by a lower photovoltage. In addition, both YD 2 and N 719 dyes exhibit the same charge-transfer resistance, indicating that the recombination rates of both dyes are very similar. The diarylamino group {{plays a key role}} to repel the <b>triiodide</b> <b>ions</b> from the titania surface so that the charge recombination of YD 2 is less significant compared with that of YD 0...|$|R
