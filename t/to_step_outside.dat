500|$|Nagy set the {{adaptation}} {{several years later}} than the time in which the novel is set, so [...] "the dawn of the Eisenhower administration {{and the rise of}} HUAC could be front and center". One of the challenges of adapting the novel was translating the subjective and limited third-person viewpoint whereby the narrator [...] "sits on the shoulder of Therese and makes regular advances into (and retreats from) her head" [...] and Carol is thus largely seen through Therese's fanatical prism. Nagy was initially apprehensive of the narrative structure, considering [...] "there's no character of Carol. She's a ghost appropriately, as she should be, in the novel", adding that she was [...] "overwhelmed by the task of {{trying to come up with}} the visual equivalent for it structurally." [...] Nagy decided to split the point of view and shift perspectives from Therese to Carol, as [...] "the point of view is always with the more vulnerable party". She made Therese a photographer instead of a set designer, allowing her [...] "to be seen moving from objects to people", which Nagy likened to Highsmith as Therese is a [...] "clear stand-in" [...] for the author. Nagy drew from her personal knowledge of Highsmith for Therese, describing one of Therese's lines, [...] "I started taking pictures of people because my friend says I have to be more interested in humans", as the epitome of Highsmith: [...] "that ability <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>outside</b> of life and comment on it before participating in it". For the character of Carol, Nagy took inspiration from the silhouette and underpinning of Grace Kelly's character in Rear Window (1954). Nagy had freedom in [...] "inventing a life for , for whom, basically, we knew the outline of what was going on." [...] Once Nagy was able to dig into and understand the inner life of Carol, her motivations given the circumstances, then the character became easy to write.
