5|$|The late 1960s {{and early}} 1970s saw several {{countries}} experimenting with gas turbine trains. The UAC <b>TurboTrain</b> {{had been in}} revenue service in the United States and Canada since 1968, with mixed results. British Rail began testing the APT-E in 1972; {{for a variety of}} reasons, British Rail did not pursue gas turbine propulsion.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965, {{the newly}} formed United States Department of Transportation (DOT) was funding {{a number of studies}} into {{high-speed}} trains under the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) group. One of these projects was the UAC <b>TurboTrain,</b> which had recently entered service with Canadian National Railways, only to be pulled from service shortly after due {{to a wide variety of}} minor problems. One of the two three-car <b>TurboTrain</b> prototypes built for the DOT visited Transpo.|$|E
25|$|In December 1967, the UAC <b>Turbotrain</b> set a speed {{record for}} a {{production}} train: 170.8 miles per hour (274.8 kilometers per hour) between New Brunswick and Trenton, New Jersey.|$|E

50|$|Two <b>Turbotrains</b> (DOT1 and DOT2) {{were built}} at the Pullman Works in Chicago. High-speed testing of the trains was {{performed}} from a base at Fields Point in Providence, Rhode Island, using track between Route 128 near Boston and Westerly, Rhode Island (track segments along this section, to this day, are the only areas where Amtrak operates Acela revenue service at 150 mph). In a competition with a GE powered Metroliner on Penn Central's main-line between Trenton and New Brunswick, New Jersey on December 20, 1967, one of the <b>TurboTrains</b> reached 170.8 mph. This remains the world speed record for gas turbine-powered rail vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Four {{units of}} <b>Turbotrains</b> were {{introduced}} in Iran in 1974 with max speed of 160 km/h between Tehran-Mashhad that later in 2008 were converted to DMU by substitution of diesel instead of turbines.|$|R
25|$|Yearly {{passenger}} {{levels on}} Canada's passenger trains peaked at 60 million during World War II. Following the war {{the growth of}} air travel and the personal automobile caused significant loss of mode share for Canada's passenger train operators. By the 1960s {{it was obvious to}} both Canadian National Railway (CN) and the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) that passenger trains were no longer economically viable. The CP sought to divest itself of its trains but federal government regulators and politicians balked, forcing the CP to maintain a minimal service through the 1970s, with the government subsidizing up to 80% of losses. CN, being a Crown corporation at that time, was encouraged by the federal government and political interests to invest in passenger trains. Innovative marketing schemes such as Red, White, and Blue fares, new equipment such as scenic dome cars and rail diesel cars, and services such as Rapido and the UAC <b>TurboTrain</b> trains temporarily increased numbers of passengers, reversing previous declines.|$|E
500|$|The RTG (abbreviated {{from the}} French Rame à Turbine à Gaz, or gas turbine train) model was an Americanized {{version of the}} French ANF T 2000 RTG <b>Turbotrain</b> (related to the {{prototype}} precursor to the very first TGV trainset, the TGV 001). The RTGs used European-style couplers (buffers and turnbuckles) between their cars, because they were built in France by ANF for French railways. Another change was the installation of top-mounted Nathan P1234A5 horns, {{a variation of the}} standard Nathan P5. Amtrak obtained a permanent waiver from the Federal Railroad Administration which exempted the RTGs from the buff strength requirement of [...] The RTGs met a lower standard set by the International Union of Railways.|$|E
2500|$|Acela Express's fastest {{schedule}} between New York and Washington DC was 2hours and 45minutes in 2012. $450 {{million was}} allotted by President Barack Obama's administration to replace catenary and upgrade signals between Trenton and New Brunswick, {{which will allow}} speeds of [...] over [...] runs after 2016. This section of track holds {{the record for the}} highest speed by a train in the US, which is , achieved in a test run by the U.S./Canada-built UAC <b>TurboTrain</b> on December 20, 1967.|$|E
50|$|In May 1966 Canadian National Railways ordered five seven-car <b>TurboTrains</b> for the Montreal-Toronto service. They {{planned to}} operate the trains in tandem, {{connecting}} two trains together into a larger fourteen-car arrangement with a total capacity of 644 passengers. The Canadian trains were built by Montreal Locomotive Works, with their ST6 engines supplied by UAC's Canadian division (now Pratt & Whitney Canada) in Longueuil, Quebec. The Canadian <b>Turbotrains</b> were originally planned {{to have been in}} service by the summer of 1967, but technical difficulties with the trainsets delayed passenger service entry until December 12, 1969; the primary failures concerned the auxiliary equipment and caused the power on the trains to go out.|$|R
50|$|By 1974, after {{substantial}} {{modifications of}} the gearbox device and pendular suspension, and reinforcement {{of the sound}} insulation, the <b>Turbotrains</b> finally took up untroubled service. CN operated the Turbos until 1978, when their passenger operations were taken over by Via Rail, who continued the service.|$|R
50|$|The Egyptian National Railways {{purchased}} three enlarged 10-car <b>turbotrains</b> {{manufactured by}} ANF for a planned 160 km/h {{service on the}} 208 km route between Cairo and Alexandria. However, the trackage is not suitable for such speeds, and the trains have been restricted to 140 km/h maximum and 60 km/h {{in the vicinity of}} Cairo.|$|R
2500|$|The WABCO N-Type coupler {{was first}} {{developed}} for the prototype Pittsburgh Skybus system with the initial model N-1 as applied only to the three Skybus cars. The updated model N-2 with a larger [...] gathering range was first applied to the new [...] "Airporter" [...] rapid transit cars on the Cleveland Rapid Transit line. The model N-2 used lightweight draft gear slung below the center sill, {{to allow for the}} wide swings required to go around sharp curves. This made the N-2 unsuitable for main line railroad use so an updated version N-2-A was developed for that market. The first of these were fitted in 1968 to the UAC <b>TurboTrain</b> with 228 electrical contacts and the Budd Metropolitan EMU with 138 contacts. Starting in the 1970s the N-2-A was fitted to the entire SEPTA Silverliner family of MU's, the NJT Arrow series of MU's and the Metro-North/Long Island Rail Road M series of MU railcars. The N-2 was also used by the PATCO Speedline, but was replaced due to issues with the electrical contacts. Later WABCO would create a new model N-3 for the BART system with a [...] gathering range which required a rectangular funnel.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, $450 {{million was}} {{dedicated}} to increase capacity {{on one of the}} NEC's busiest segments, a [...] section between New Brunswick and Trenton. The planned six-year project will upgrade signals and electrical power systems, including catenary wires, to improve reliability, increase train speeds, and allow more frequent high-speed trains. In July 2011, a bill passed by the House of Representatives threatened funding for the project and others announced at the same time, but the money was released the following month. The project, along with the purchase of new train sets, is expected to raise speeds on the segment to [...] In September 2012, Acela test trains hit [...] over the segment. (The 2012 tests did not break the longtime record on this stretch of track: , set on December 20, 1967, by the U.S.-built UAC <b>TurboTrain.</b> This also stands as the record top speed for a North American train.) The track work is one of several projects planned for the [...] "New Jersey Speedway" [...] section of the NEC, which include a new station at North Brunswick, the Mid-Line Loop (a flyover for reversing train direction), and the re-construction of County Yard, to be done in coordination with NJT.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Turbotrain</b> was any {{of several}} French high-speed, gas turbine trains. The {{earliest}} <b>Turbotrain</b> entered service in 1967, {{for use on}} France's SNCF intercity lines. There were several versions, four in total, with the last exiting service in 2005, {{and it is the}} <b>Turbotrain</b> that made advances possible for the TGV.|$|E
50|$|Building on the {{successful}} {{experience of the}} earlier TGS and the ETG <b>turbotrains,</b> French state railway company SNCF commissioned the T 2000 for entry into service in the early 1970s. The objective was to offer the same service speed as electric traction (160 km/h at the time) on French trunk lines that {{had yet to be}} electrified.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Turbotrains</b> were {{evaluated}} by multiple journalists in the Canadian press as having [...] "rail noise that substantially exceeds that of standard equipment" [...] and having poor riding characteristics, especially on curves, with one journalist stating that [...] "the single-axle articulation in practice negotiates curves {{in a series of}} short jerks rather than the smooth flowing motion promised in press releases".|$|R
50|$|The Turbo's {{final run}} was on October 31, 1982, {{when they were}} {{replaced}} by the all-Canadian LRC trainsets from Bombardier Transportation, which employed conventional diesel-electric locomotives. Although they had an early reputation for unreliability, according to CN's records, the rebuilt <b>TurboTrains</b> had an availability rate of over 97% for their careers with CN and Via. The LRC suffered from similar teething problems, notably with the tilt system locking the cars in a tilted position.|$|R
50|$|CN Rail placed {{some early}} hopes with the UAC <b>TurboTrain,</b> in its Toronto-Montreal route during the 1960s. The <b>TurboTrain</b> {{was a true}} HST with the train sets {{achieving}} speeds as high as 201 km/h in regular service. CN's, and later Via Rail's, <b>TurboTrain</b> service were marred with lengthy interruptions to address design problems and having to cope with poor track quality (accounted for by dual passenger-freight use); as such, the trains were operated at 161 km/h. The <b>TurboTrain</b> featured the latest technology advances such as passive coach tilting, Talgo attachment for rigid coach articulation and gas turbine power.|$|E
50|$|SNCF (French National Railways) used {{a number}} of gas-turbine trainsets, called the <b>Turbotrain,</b> in non-electrified territory. These {{typically}} consisted of a power car at each end with three cars between them. <b>Turbotrain</b> was in use up until 2005. After retirement, 4 sets were sold for further use in Iran.|$|E

50|$|Initial {{commercial}} service started soon after. On its first westbound run the Turbo attained 104 mph 10 minutes outside of Dorval. During speed runs on April 22, 1976, it achieved 140.55 mph near Gananoque, the Canadian record to this day. However, in regular passenger service the <b>Turbotrains</b> {{were limited to}} 95 mph (153 km/hr) in Canada because of the Canadian route's numerous grade-crossings, estimated at 240 public highway grade-crossings and 700 agricultural or private crossings between Montreal and Toronto.|$|R
2500|$|TGV ( [...] , [...] "high-speed train") is France's {{intercity}} {{high-speed rail}} service, operated by SNCF, the national rail operator. It {{was developed in}} the 1970s by GEC-Alsthom and SNCF. LGV is the track the TGV trains runs on. Originally designed as <b>turbotrains</b> to be powered by gas turbines, TGV prototypes evolved into electric trains with the 1973 oil crisis. Following the inaugural service between Paris and Lyon in 1981 on the LGV Sud-Est ("LGV") ( [...] , high-speed line), the network, centred on Paris, has expanded to connect main cities across France and in adjacent countries on combinations of high-speed and conventional lines.|$|R
50|$|By the 1970s, {{especially}} after the 1973 oil crisis, these advantages were no longer enough to overcome the increased fuel costs, and most turbine-based train designs disappeared. While two large classes of gas-turbine powered intercity railcars (ETG and RTG) continued {{to be used in}} France up until about 2000, both the TGV and APT switched to all-electric operation, with the installation of overhead lines to support them. In North America, where funding to upgrade rail lines was limited, electric operation was only an option for the busiest routes, and remains rare. Only Canadian National Railway (CN) and Via Rail continued to run their <b>TurboTrains</b> into the early 1980s, before they too were replaced with diesel-electric units, such as the LRC train.|$|R

5000|$|This is the first-generation of {{production}} <b>Turbotrains.</b> These ETG (Elément à Turbine à Gaz) trains were four carriage trainsets which offered 188 seats and possessed one diesel engine and one gas turbine engine. The gas-turbine engine was a 820 kW Turbomeca Turmo IIIF3 gas-turbine Voith hydraulic (derived from a helicopter turbine) and the diesel was a 320 kW Saurer SDHR diesel-mechanical. These trains reached 160 km/h. The ETGs entered service in 1971 on the Paris-Caen-Cherbourg. A total of 14 of these four-car trainsets were manufactured from 1969-1972 by ANF. These trains were maintained at the Venissieux trainshed in Lyon for [...] "many years", but {{were moved to}} the Lyon Vaise depot in the 1980s. Electrification of the Grenoble line caused some trainsets to be shifted to work in Clermont Ferrand and Metz.|$|R
50|$|As {{technology}} evolved with time, {{different types}} of railcar passed through Bellegarde, An X2700 class RGP2 passed through on its inaugural trip from Lyon-Perrache to Geneva on 30 June 1954. The following year, on 16 December 1955, the Culoz - Bellegarde section was electrified with 1.5 kV DC. From 10 June 1959, the Alpazur connection (Genève - Bellegarde - Grenoble - Veynes-Dévoluy - Digne) returning via the ligne des Alpes was operated with X4200 class panoramic railcars. Then on 31 May 1964, a first-class express train, Le Rhodanien, {{was put on the}} line linking Geneva to Marseille. 1969 saw the arrival Catalan-Talgo trains on the creation of a Trans-Europ-Express link between Geneva and Barcelona via Bellegarde, Chambéry et Grenoble on 1 June. In 1972, passenger trains were making up to 12 return journeys per day between Geneva and Grenoble. On 1 October 1972, X4500 class railcars went into service on the Valence - Geneva route via Grenoble, Chambéry et Bellegarde, then on 28 September 1975, first generation <b>turbotrains</b> (so-called 'ETGs') took over. They were so successful that they soon needed to be coupled in pairs to meet the demand.|$|R
5000|$|The TGV (Train à Grande Vitesse, {{high-speed}} train) is France's {{high-speed rail}} service. The {{idea of a}} high-speed train in France was born about twenty years before the first TGVs entered service. At that time, about 1960, a radical new concept was thought up; combining very high speeds and steep grades would allow a railway to follow the contours of existing terrain, like a gentle roller coaster. Instead {{of one or two}} percent grades which would be considered steep in normal applications, grades up to four percent would be feasible, thus allowing more flexible (and cheaper) routing of new lines. Over the next several years, this very general idea gave rise to a variety of high speed transportation concepts, which tended to move away from conventional [...] "wheel on rail" [...] vehicles. Indeed, the French government at the time favoured more [...] "modern" [...] air-cushioned or maglev trains, such as Bertin's Aérotrain; Steel wheel on rail was considered a dead-end technology. Simultaneously, SNCF (the French national railways) was trying to raise the speeds of conventional trains into the range 180 to 200 km/h (110 to 125 mph) for non-electrified sections, by using gas turbines for propulsion. Energy was reasonably cheap in those years, and gas turbines (originally designed for helicopters) were a compact and efficient way to fulfil requirements for more power. Following on the TGS prototype in 1967, SNCF introduced gas turbine propulsion with the ETG (Elément à Turbine à Gaz, or Gas Turbine Unit) <b>turbotrains</b> in Paris - Cherbourg service, in March 1970.|$|R
