5|$|A defenseman is {{a player}} {{position}} whose {{responsibility is to}} assist the goalkeeper in preventing the opposing team from scoring. Each team fields three defensemen. These players generally remain on the defensive half of the field. Unless a defenseman gets the ball and chooses to run up the field and try to score or pass, by doing this <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> cross the midfield line and signal one midfielder to stay back. A defensemen carries a long crosse which provides an advantage in reach for intercepting passes and checking.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} problem that arises at {{the interface between}} wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues {{that make up a}} wheel are living, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be supplied with oxygen and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, {{would not be able to}} provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to diffuse across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.|$|E
5|$|State {{auditors}} Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe) and Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) soon arrive, and {{the extremely}} cheerful Chris paints an optimistic {{picture of how}} they will fix the budget, but leaves the details to the more serious Ben. When Ben explains <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> slash the budget of every department by nearly 40 or 50 percent, Leslie angrily lashes out at Ben, who responds {{to her that the}} poorly managed government is to blame. Later, at April's party, Tom desperately tries to pick up women, but to no avail, while Leslie and Ann get extremely drunk together. Andy and April appear to be getting along, but when he goes to the bar to get a drink for April, a drunken Ann flirts with him. An upset April flirts with Tom's annoying friend Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz) to make Andy jealous. Andy gets upset, believing he misread April's signals all along, and April later regrets what she did. Ben arrives at the party and tries to smooth things out with a drunken Leslie, but she again angrily lashes out at him.|$|E

25|$|The Inter-Provincial Series ('Interpros') was {{introduced}} {{for the first}} time in 2013 as part of Cricket Ireland's strategy to attain Test status by 2020.

Munster were not included in the initial seasons as <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> continue to focus on expanding their club system and developing their talent pool.|$|E
25|$|Another {{option to}} share music files is to burn CDs. To do this the user needs {{to create a}} {{playlist}} with the songs the user wishes to share. If the playlist exceeds roughly twenty songs it is likely <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> make multiple CDs. By inserting a disk into the disk drive {{a button on the}} bottom of the window should give the option to burn a disk. The files are automatically downloaded to the disk and may be uploaded onto another computer or saved as a backup for the user’s computer.|$|E

50|$|According to ODI policy conclusions, {{in order}} for wider scale, more {{sustainable}} implementation to be achieved, village projects <b>need</b> <b>to</b> identify shared goals, seeking evidence-based, cost-effective interventions by governments and implementing agencies. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> focus on addressing upstream investments such as training facilities for front-line staff.|$|R
500|$|UN Secretary-General Ban {{in early}} October {{publicly}} recognized {{many of the}} challenges of the weapons destruction effort, in particular the dangerous nature of chemical arms destruction during a civil war, especially in urban areas such as Damascus, Aleppo, and Homs. [...] "Heavy artillery, air strikes, mortar barrages and the indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas are commonplace and battle lines shift quickly," [...] he wrote. Ban added that the most challenging phase of the destruction effort would begin in November, when OPCW and UN experts begin destroying Syria's estimated 1,000 tons of precursor chemicals and chemical weapons. In order to do so, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> cross battle lines between governments and rebel forces. The Syrian government and Western-backed opposition forces have pledged cooperation with chemical disarmament, but Al Qaeda-linked rebel groups, including Al Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, have not.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 March, the Minister of Earthquake Recovery, Gerry Brownlee, told a media {{briefing}} {{that if he}} had his way, most of Christchurch's heritage buildings would be demolished but {{that he would like to}} see resources go into rebuilding the ChristChurch Cathedral, the Catholic Basilica, the Canterbury Provincial Chambers and the Christchurch Arts Centre – [...] "but that's it – There will be a few others perhaps, but those would be the most iconic buildings that Christchurch residents would want to see rebuilt. They won't be put back the way they were. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have a great deal of strengthening put into them and it will be quite a long consideration as to how those things might be done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once dressed, they {{assemble}} a flying boat called [...] "The Flyboat" [...] from classroom objects: a flying disc for a body, felt marker caps as rocket exhausts, a marble, wheels, the mast, and {{a sheet of}} paper for the sail. In some episodes, the Wonder Pets will instead opt for a different mode of transportation such as sub called the [...] "Flysub", which they will construct using additional objects in the classroom or they will modify the Flyboat in some way either out of necessity (such as replacing one of the pieces of the Flyboat with something else) or some other reason. Usually, the Wonder Pets encounter some sort of obstacle before leaving the classroom. The solution is invariably similar to the action <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> take to save the animal in trouble.|$|E
50|$|When {{the insured}} person uses a medical {{facility}} that accepts NHI, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> only <b>need</b> <b>to</b> pay part of the cost.

2500|$|On {{the first}} day of the participant's visit to the studios, there is a review of the secret footage along with the participant. On the videotape, there are {{normally}} comments from family members and friends about the participant's style and appearance. The experts then go through their entire wardrobe, which has been brought with the participant. They critique the items and then most of the clothing gets discarded or even cut up with scissors. The participant is asked to put on an outfit, that they like and think most suits their figure, and then must face the 360 degree mirror. The experts comment on why the outfit does not suit them. [...] The experts give suggestions throughout the day and then present three different outfits to the participant to help illustrate the rules that <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> follow as they shop for new clothing.|$|E
2500|$|On February 22, 2012 {{the format}} of Iron Chef Thailand has been changed to: the first 30 minutes {{of the program is}} where the Challenger Chef will present his/her [...] "Signature Dish with a Special Ingredient" [...] to the guests.

50|$|In some {{countries}} with currencies {{that tend to}} depreciate, foreign currency mortgages are common, enabling lenders to lend in a stable foreign currency, whilst the borrower takes on the currency risk that the currency <b>will</b> depreciate and <b>they</b> <b>will</b> therefore <b>need</b> <b>to</b> convert higher amounts of the domestic currency to repay the loan.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, as {{the crops}} would {{be sold in}} the same {{infrastructures}} {{in which they are}} grown, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be transported between production and sale, resulting in less spoilage, infestation, and energy required than conventional farming encounters. Research has shown that 30% of harvested crops are wasted due to spoilage and infestation, though this number is much lower in developed nations.|$|R
