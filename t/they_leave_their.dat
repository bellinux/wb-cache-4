25|$|C.torquatus is {{the only}} social bat species that {{utilizes}} majority time in roosting services. They are nocturnal, extremely migratory and colonial. Hunting starts {{early in the morning}} where <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> roost and begin preying on larger insects compared to other small bats who cannot. On their hunting grounds, they develop precautionary skills to protect against predators, echolocation is used whilst this behavior.|$|E
25|$|Resource {{theory was}} {{suggested}} by William Goode (1971). Women {{who are most}} dependent on the spouse for economic well being (e.g. homemakers/housewives, women with handicaps, the unemployed), and are the primary caregiver to their children, fear the increased financial burden if <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> marriage. Dependency means that they have fewer options and few resources to help them cope with or change their spouse's behavior.|$|E
25|$|Road to Price is a six episode reality {{documentary}} show {{aired on}} the now-defunct CBS Innertube from September 20 to 27 in 2006.

25|$|Males {{and females}} are {{different}} in many ways. Males rove frequently, searching for prey and for mates. Females, however, spend {{the majority of their}} lives inside their diving bells; they ambush their prey. Males are better divers than females. Females and juveniles are active during the night, while males are active during the daytime. The young do not balloon like other spiders do, rather, <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> nest and find their new homes by swimming.|$|E
25|$|Their outfit is also {{different}} from that of other Arabs, since the men wear long 'jellabiya' and a 'smagg' (red white draped headcover) or 'aymemma' (white headcover) or a white small headdress, sometimes held in place by an 'agall' (a black cord). Bedouin women usually wear brightly coloured long dresses but outside they wear 'abaya' (a thin, long black coat sometimes covered with shiny embroidery) and they will always cover their head and hair with a 'tarha' (a black, thin shawl) when <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> house.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, coccinellids usually {{begin to}} appear indoors {{in the autumn}} when <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> summer feeding sites in fields, forests, and yards and search out places to spend the winter. Typically, when {{temperatures}} warm to the mid-60s F (around 18Â°C) in the late afternoon, following a period of cooler weather, they will swarm onto or into buildings illuminated by the sun. Swarms of coccinellids fly to buildings in September through November depending on location and weather conditions. Homes or other buildings near fields or woods are particularly prone to infestation.|$|E

25|$|A. ocellaris feed on {{plankton}} and algae, {{thus they}} are considered omnivores. Feeding is also affected by the hierarchy in A. ocellaris groups. Since the smaller, less dominant fish face aggression from the more aggressive fish, they have less energy to forage for food. Thus, they usually do not eat {{as much as the}} dominant fish do, because of reduced energy, but also because of the increased danger they face when <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> anemone since they are smaller. In other words, the larger fish will usually travel farther than the smaller fish. Generally, the A. ocellaris feed on algae, copepods, and zooplankton.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountain}} gorilla is diurnal, most active between 6:00a.m. and 6:00p.m. Many of these hours are spent eating, as {{large quantities of}} food are needed to sustain its massive bulk. It forages in early morning, rests during the late morning and around midday, and in the afternoon it forages again before resting at night. Each gorilla builds a nest from surrounding vegetation to sleep in, constructing a new one every evening. Only infants sleep in the same nest as their mothers. <b>They</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> sleeping sites when the sun rises at around 6 am, except when it is cold and overcast; then they often stay longer in their nests.|$|E
25|$|While the {{peacekeeping}} force is being assembled, {{a variety of}} diplomatic activities are being undertaken by UN staff. The exact size and strength of the force must be agreed to {{by the government of}} the nation whose territory the conflict is on. The Rules of Engagement must be developed and approved by both the parties involved and the Security Council. These give the specific mandate and scope of the mission (e.g. when may the peacekeepers, if armed, use force, and where may they go within the host nation). Often, it will be mandated that peacekeepers have host government minders with them whenever <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> base. This complexity has caused problems in the field.|$|E

25|$|When {{males are}} fully mature <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> webs {{to search for}} a {{suitable}} female, often using web characteristics to identify potential mates. Females are most likely to mate directly after their final molt at the beginning of adulthood and later in adulthood when they are feeding. There are often multiple males attempting to court the same female and thus competition for territory on the web occurs but is rarely physical as smaller males surrender area to larger ones. When males approach females they are often feeding, allowing the males to get closer without an aggressive response and also meaning the female is not moving. On approach the male makes himself known by tapping on a web strand to ensure the female is amenable before proceeding to mate. When met with aggression males will stop approaching and remain in the same location until the female relaxes or they retreat. Females engage in multiple mating but there is no benefit to the offspring as a result of this, however the energy cost of repelling a male is higher than that of allowing him to copulate. As a result of this sperm competition occurs through males altering the duration of mating as well as the frequency, longer mating is proportional to a greater likelihood of success. Sexual cannibalism is uncommon in Nephila as a result of male mating behaviours. By copulating when females are immobile after molting or inactive due to feeding the males increase their chances of survival. Males also approach {{on the opposite side of}} the web to the female making it more difficult to be caught. Sexual cannibalism does still occur and generally is more common in larger males and from older females.|$|E
500|$|In 1906 O. C. Simonds a {{well-known}} prairie school landscape architect was hired, he simplified the road system, planned walks and planting areas.

500|$|Most {{vegetation}} {{communities on}} which this species forages produce nectar and pollen seasonally and are abundant unpredictably, so the flying fox's migration traits cope with this. The time when flying foxes leave their roosts to feed depends on foraging light and predation risk. Flying foxes have more time and light when foraging if <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> roosts early in the day. The entire colony may leave later if a predatory bird is present, while lactating females leave earlier. With males, the bachelors leave earlier than harem-holding males, which guard their wait until all their females have left. The flying foxes that leave the roost earlier are more vulnerable to predation, and some other flying foxes will wait for others to leave, a phenomenon labelled the [...] "after you" [...] effect.|$|E

500|$|Skaaren's rewrite {{drastically}} {{shifted the}} film's tone, indicating the graphic {{nature of the}} Maitlands' deaths while depicting the afterlife as a complex bureaucracy. Skaaren's rewrite also altered McDowell's depiction of the limbo that keeps Barbara and Adam trapped inside of their home; in McDowell's script, it {{takes the form of}} a massive, empty void filled with giant clock gears that shred the fabric of time and space as they move. Skaaren had Barbara and Adam encounter different limbos every time <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> home, including the [...] "clock world", and the Sandworm's world, identified as Saturn's moon Titan. Skaaren also introduced the leitmotif of music accompanying Barbara and Adam's ghostly hijinks, although his script specified R tunes instead of Harry Belafonte, and was to have concluded with Lydia dancing to [...] "When a Man Loves a Woman." ...|$|E
500|$|Both {{males and}} females {{establish}} home ranges, and are most active only in certain regions ('core areas') within them. The area of these ranges can vary from prey density, availability of cover and human interference could be significant factors in determining their size. Home ranges might overlap extensively, but occupants show minimal interaction. Aggressive encounters are rare, as servals appear to mutually avoid one another rather than fight and defend their ranges. Agonistic behaviour involves vertical movement of the head (contrary to the horizontal movement observed in other cats), raising the hair and the tail, displaying the teeth and the white band on the ears, and yowling. Individuals mark their ranges and preferred paths by spraying urine on nearby vegetation, dropping scats along the way, and rubbing their mouth on grasses or the ground while releasing saliva. Servals tend to be sedentary, shifting only a few kilometres away even if <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> range.|$|E
500|$|Gestation {{lasts for}} two to three months, {{following}} which a litter of one to four kittens is born. Births take place in secluded areas, for example in dense vegetation or burrows abandoned by aardvarks and porcupines. Blind at birth, newborn weigh nearly [...] and have soft, woolly hair (greyer than in adults) and unclear markings. The eyes open after nine to thirteen days. Weaning begins after a month of birth; the mother brings small kills to her kittens and calls out to them as she approaches the [...] "den". A mother with young kittens rests for a notably lesser time and has to spend almost twice the time and energy for hunting than do other servals. If disturbed, the mother will shift her kittens one by one to a more secure place. Kittens eventually start accompanying their mother to hunts. At around six months, they acquire their permanent canines and begin to hunt themselves; <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> mother at about 12 months of age. They may reach sexual maturity from 12 to 25 months of age. Life expectancy is about 10 years in the wild, and up to 20 years in captivity.|$|E
