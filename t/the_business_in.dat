5|$|Despite his {{constant}} {{attention to the}} business, the poor supply and insufficient supply of free-labor products proved to be insurmountable, {{making it impossible for}} Coffin to find a replacement to run the company so that he could return to Indiana.

5|$|Despite {{holding a}} {{monopoly}} on cases in the Court of Common Pleas, Serjeants also took most of <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>in</b> the Court of King's Bench. Although required to make the Common Pleas their principal place of work, {{there is evidence of}} Serjeants who did not; one, Robert Mennell, worked entirely in the North of England after his creation in 1547 and was not known in Westminster, where the Common Pleas was located. This was also a time of great judicial success for the Serjeants; since only Serjeants could be appointed to the common law courts, many also sat in the Exchequer of Pleas, a court of equity. This period was not a time of success for the profession overall, however, despite the brisk business being done. The rise of central courts other than the Common Pleas allowed other lawyers to gain advocacy experience and work, drawing it away from the Serjeants, {{and at the same time}} the few Serjeants could not handle all <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>in</b> the Common Pleas, allowing the rise of barristers as dedicated advocates.|$|E

In July 1981, the Orpington operation was given a separate licence, under the name Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) Limited, with six vehicles allocated to it. By 1983, however, {{it became clear that}} the local area management of Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) wanted to develop <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>in</b> a different way from that of the main company.

The company sold hardwood, lumber, and wagon and carriage materials, primarily manufacturing wagon axles, wheels, and frames. W.Harrison Holt and Ames both temporarily returned around 1871 to New Hampshire – where both were married – {{to manage the}} eastern business. The brothers built a factory in Concord, New Hampshire, to manufacture wagon wheels, wheel components, bodies and running gear. In 1872, at age 23, Benjamin was given an interest in his father's business, and he assumed more responsibility for the company's operations. W.Harrison Holt moved to Tiffin, Ohio, to manage the company's lumber business there, where he remained until the early 1880s. Their mother died in 1875, and their father died eight years later in 1883. After his father's death, Benjamin Holt left New Hampshire in 1883 to help Charles build <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>in</b> California.|$|E

The company became Primerica Financial Services, and was later bought out by Citigroup in 1989.

5|$|Norman {{was born}} in Ulverston, Lancashire (now part of the {{administrative}} county of Cumbria), on 6 September 1883 to Thomas Birkett, a draper, and his wife Agnes, who died in 1884 of tuberculosis. He attended the Wesleyan primary school in Ulverston until 1894, {{when he moved to}} Barrow-in-Furness Grammar School. Although intelligent, Birkett was not noted as a particularly academic student and spent as much time on practical jokes as he did on his studies. He left school in 1898, starting work as an apprentice in one of the draper's shops owned by his father and beginning to preach. He was a popular local preacher on the local Methodist circuit, and, on deciding that he was unlikely to be a good draper, his father allowed him to leave <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>in</b> 1904 to become a minister under Charles Bedale. In 1905, Bedale suggested Birkett should go to Cambridge University to study history and theology. Birkett liked the idea, having previously conversed with A. C. Benson, the Master of Magdalene College, and applied to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. The college offered him a place, with the condition {{that he would have to}} pass an entrance examination and complete the responsions to be accepted into the university as a whole. He spent three months learning Latin and Greek and was accepted into the university in October 1907.|$|E

40|$|Title: <b>Business</b> Share <b>in</b> Joint Ownership of Multiple Individuals The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyse a <b>business</b> share <b>in</b> joint {{ownership}} of multiple individuals. This paper {{is composed of}} four parts, each of them dealing with a different variation of <b>the</b> <b>business</b> share <b>in</b> joint ownership. The first part of this work is concerned with a legal interpretation of Section 114 paragraph 3 of the Commercial Code which, inter alia, sets forth that one business share may be held by more than one person. It introduces basic terminology that will be used throughout the work. It concludes that there are three variations of <b>the</b> <b>business</b> share <b>in</b> joint ownership. The first of them is <b>the</b> <b>business</b> share <b>in</b> co-ownership under Section 114 paragraph 3 of the Commercial Code (joint <b>business</b> share <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stricter sense); the second is <b>the</b> <b>business</b> share <b>in</b> matrimonial (community) property pursuant to Section 143 paragraph 2 of the Civil Code; and the third is <b>the</b> <b>business</b> share <b>in</b> matrimonial (community) property under Section 114 paragraph 3 of the Commercial Code (joint <b>business</b> share <b>in</b> <b>the</b> broader sense).
