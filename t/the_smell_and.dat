5|$|The {{river otter}} is {{physically}} well-equipped for aquatic life. The ears are short, the neck {{is the same}} diameter as the head, the legs are short and powerful, the toes are fully webbed, and the tail (one-third of body length) is tapered. These qualities give the river otter a streamlined profile in water, but reduce agility on land. <b>The</b> <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> hearing abilities of the river otter are acute. The otter has a delicate sense of touch in the paws in addition to great dexterity. River otters characteristically approach within {{a few feet of}} a boat or a person on shore because they're near-sighted, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight. River otters have transparent nictitating membranes to protect their eyes while swimming.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>smell,</b> <b>and</b> people's {{fears of}} its {{possible}} effects, prompted {{action from the}} local and national administrators who had been considering possible solutions for the problem. The authorities accepted a proposal from the civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette to move the effluent eastwards along a series of interconnecting sewers that sloped towards outfalls beyond the metropolitan area. Work on high-, mid- and low-level systems for the new Northern and Southern Outfall Sewers started {{at the beginning of}} 1859 and lasted until 1875. To aid the drainage, pumping stations were placed to lift the sewage from lower levels into higher pipes. Two of the more ornate stations, Abbey Mills in Stratford and Crossness on the Erith Marshes, are listed for protection by English Heritage. Bazalgette's plan introduced the three embankments to London in which the sewers ran—the Victoria, Chelsea and Albert Embankments.|$|E

25|$|Garderobes were toilets {{used in the}} Post-classical history, most {{commonly}} found in upper-class dwellings. Essentially, they were flat pieces of wood or stone spanning from one wall to the other, {{with one or more}} holes to sit on. These were above chutes or pipes that discharged outside the castle or Manor house. Garderobes would be placed in areas away from bedrooms to shun <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> also near kitchens or fireplaces to keep the enclosure warm.|$|E
25|$|According to {{official}} directives concerning nourishment issued {{at the beginning}} of 1916, each week the prisoner was to have 600-1,000g of potatoes, 200-300g of vegetables at lunch, meat three times, fish twice and 150g of legumes. The reality could be far from what these menus prescribed. Not only was the food insufficient, it was often quite detrimental to health: “The other day I saw, in our kitchens, quarters of refrigerated beef of which <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> greenish tint were so pronounced that our cooks refused to prepare them. The German head doctor, called to arbitrate, ordered them soaked in a solution of permanganate and, the day after the morrow, this meat, thus disinfected, decorated the ordinary one”.|$|E
25|$|When Catherine II came {{to power}} in 1762, the city's filth and smell of sewage was {{depicted}} by observers as a symptom of disorderly life styles of lower-class Russians recently arrived from the farms. Elites called for improving sanitation, which became part of Catherine's plans for increasing control over social life. National political and military successes from 1812 through 1855 calmed the critics and validated efforts to produce a more enlightened and stable society. There was less talk about <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> the poor conditions of public health. However, in the wake of Russia's failures in the Crimean War in 1855–56, confidence in the ability of the state to maintain order in the slums eroded, and demands for improved public health put filth back on the agenda.|$|E

25|$|Spiny {{lobsters}} tend {{to live in}} crevices {{of rocks}} and coral reefs, only occasionally venturing out at night to seek snails, clams, sea-hares, crabs, or sea urchins to eat. Sometimes, they migrate in very large groups in long files of lobsters across the sea floor. These lines {{may be more than}} 50 lobsters long. Spiny lobsters navigate using <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> taste of natural substances in the water that change {{in different parts of the}} ocean. It was recently discovered that spiny lobsters can also navigate by detecting the Earth's magnetic field. They keep together by contact, using their long antennae. Potential predators may be deterred from eating spiny lobsters by a loud screech made by the antennae of the spiny lobsters rubbing against a smooth part of the exoskeleton. Spiny lobsters usually exhibit the social habit of being together. However recent studies indicate that healthy lobsters move away from infected ones, leaving the diseased lobsters to fend for themselves.|$|E
25|$|Metaxa {{comes in}} nine major varieties: Three Stars, Five Stars, Five Stars Honey Shot, Seven Stars, Twelve stars, Grande Fine, Private Reserve, Angels Treasure and AEN. The number of stars {{represents}} {{the number of}} years the blend is matured. The three and 5 star are not as different, but the 5 star is notably drier, making the alcohol more pronounced. The seven and twelve star are more flavoursome and complex, while the Twelve-star G.O.R. is again more dry, in this case because there is no addition of wine. In either of the two latter varieties, <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> taste of the barrel in which the brandy matured is noticeable. The house of Metaxa has recently launched a new product, the Metaxa Twelve Star containing distillates matured for 12 years adding Muscat wine from the island of Samos, unlike the Metaxa Twelve Stars Grand Olympian Reserve. Metaxa Private Reserve is the most oldest member of Metaxa family. Only 5.000 numbered decanters of Metaxa Private Reserve are on the market containing distillates aged for 30 years from Spyros Metaxas' family barrels.|$|E
25|$|In 1798 Murdoch {{returned}} to Birmingham {{to work in}} the Soho foundry and continued his experiments with gas, as part of which he lit the interior of the Soho main building, although it is likely that it was lit only in part and not (at this time) permanently. In 1802 as part of the public celebrations of the Peace of Amiens he made a public exhibition of his lighting by illuminating the exterior of the Soho Foundry. The first industrial factory to be illuminated by gas was the Philips and Lee cotton mill in Manchester which was fully lit by Murdoch in 1805, four years after the idea was first broached. Initially this mill contained 50 gas lights, although this soon grew to 904. The length of time taken to complete this project was partly due to experimentations and improvements in the process developed by Murdoch to make the lighting of a large factory by gas practicable and cost effective – such as purifying the gas with lime to remove <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> determining the best temperature to heat coal to obtain the maximum quantity of gas – although Murdoch continued to be involved in other engine work for Boulton and Watt, which took up much of his time.|$|E

30|$|Vidal et. al. [39] {{presented}} {{a tool for}} detecting code <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> agglomerations of a (Java-based) system and ranking them according to different criteria [39]. The main benefit of using their tool is that developers can configure and extend it by providing different strategies to identify <b>and</b> rank <b>the</b> <b>smells</b> <b>and</b> groups of <b>smells</b> (i.e., agglomerations). However, this tool cannot present all the characteristics of agglomerations. For instance, it cannot represents the relations that exist between <b>the</b> code <b>smells</b> within an agglomeration.

25|$|Even though Sheila's {{body had}} been removed from the closet, the smell of {{decomposition}} still lingered in the apartment. Knorr became concerned that <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> physical evidence in the closet could implicate her in Sheila's death. On September 29, 1986, Knorr moved the family's belongings out of the home and ordered her youngest daughter Terry to burn down the apartment in an effort to destroy any physical evidence. During the night, Terry Knorr dumped three containers of lighter fluid on the apartment floor and set it on fire. The fire did little damage as neighbors quickly reported the fire before it spread. The closet in which Sheila died was not damaged. After Knorr's arrest, investigators were able to remove the subfloor from the closet to test it for physical evidence. After leaving the Sacramento apartment, Knorr went into hiding. Her surviving children, who were by then of legal age, severed their ties with their mother. Knorr's youngest child, 16-year-old Terry, also left her mother's care and used Sheila's identification card to pass herself off as a legal adult. The only child to remain with Knorr was Robert, Jr. who was then 19 years old. Knorr and Robert, Jr. moved to Las Vegas and attempted to keep a low profile. In November 1991, Robert Knorr, Jr. was arrested after he fatally shot a bartender in a Las Vegas bar during an attempted robbery. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Shortly after Robert, Jr.'s arrest, Knorr left Las Vegas and relocated to Salt Lake City.|$|E
500|$|When {{the railway}} line was built between Brighton and Lewes in 1846, the {{northern}} slope of Round Hill was effectively severed {{from the rest}} of the area. [...] It developed separately as an industrial area and the site of many Brighton Corporation utilities: the Brighton Dust Destructor, an incinerator for rubbish, was built in 1866, followed by another incinerator in 1898; the Municipal Abattoir was established in 1894; and in the early 20th century a meat market and a municipal cleansing station for the fumigation and delousing of people and property were built nearby. Although they occupy land that was part of the hill, these buildings were considered to be part of neighbouring Hollingdean. Residents of Round Hill, especially those who owned laundries, often complained about <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> soot from the incinerators.|$|E

500|$|There {{were plenty}} of {{descriptions}} in Chinese literature of {{the time on the}} operations and aspects of seaports, maritime merchant shipping, overseas trade, and the sailing ships themselves. In 1117, the author Zhu Yu wrote not only of the magnetic compass for navigation, but also a hundred-foot line with a hook that was cast over the deck of the ship, used to collect mud samples {{at the bottom of the}} sea in order for the crew to determine their whereabouts by <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> appearance of the mud. In addition, Zhu Yu wrote of watertight bulkhead compartments in the hulls of ships to prevent sinking if damaged, the for-and-aft lug, taut mat sails, and the practice of beating-to-windward.

The skull, especially that of the small rixosa group, has an infantile appearance when compared with that of other members of the genus Mustela (in particular, the stoat and kolonok). This is expressed in the relatively large size of the cranium and shortened facial region.

500|$|In 1935, Anne McCormick {{wrote to}} Arthur Hays Sulzberger, [...] "I hope you won't {{expect me to}} revert to 'woman's-point-of-view' stuff." [...] Later, she interviewed major {{political}} leaders and appears to have had easier access than her colleagues did. Even those who witnessed her in action were unable to explain how she got the interviews she did. Clifton Daniel said, [...] " [...] I'm sure Adenauer called her up and invited her to lunch. She never had to grovel for an appointment." [...] Covering world leaders' speeches after World War II at the National Press Club was limited to men by a Club rule. When women were eventually allowed in to hear the speeches, they still {{were not allowed to}} ask the speakers questions, although men were allowed and did ask, even though some of the women had won Pulitzer Prizes for prior work. Times reporter Maggie Hunter refused to return to the Club after covering one speech on assignment. Nan Robertson's article on the Union Stock Yards, Chicago, was read aloud as anonymous by a professor, who then said, [...] "'It will {{come as a surprise to}} you, perhaps, that the reporter is a girl, he began... asps; amazement in the ranks. 'She had used all her senses, not just her eyes, to convey <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> feel of the stockyards. She chose a difficult subject, an offensive subject. Her imagery was strong enough to revolt you.'"

500|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{nuisance}} claims; in Nichols v Marsland, for example, [...] "Act of God" [...] {{was accepted as}} a defence. One defence is that of [...] "20 years prescription", which is valid for private nuisance but not public. If a private nuisance continues for 20 years, it becomes legal by prescription, assuming the defendant can show {{that it has been}} continuous and the claimant has been aware of it. A limitation is that the 20 years is from when the activity became a nuisance, not from when the activity started. In Sturges v Bridgman, the claimant, a doctor, lived next to a [...] "confectionery business". Vibrations and noises coming from this business continued for over 20 years without causing the doctor nuisance, and the doctor only complained after building a consulting room in his garden. It was held that the actual nuisance only started when the consulting room was built and the activity began to affect the doctor, not when the activity started. A second defence is statutory authority, when an activity is authorised by a piece of legislation; this applies to both public and private nuisance. This applies even when the activity is carried out not directly in line with the statute, but intra vires. In Allen v Gulf Oil Refining Ltd, the defendant was authorised to build an oil refinery by an Act of Parliament. The Act gave no express authority to operate it, and after it came into operation the claimant argued that it caused a nuisance through <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>and</b> noise. The House of Lords held that it had statutory authority to operate the refinery, saying [...] "Parliament can hardly be supposed to have intended the refinery to be nothing more than a visual adornment to the landscape in an area of natural beauty". The statutory authority defence has recently been subject to legislative consideration in the Planning Act 2008, which expands the defence to over 14 types of infrastructure development.|$|E
