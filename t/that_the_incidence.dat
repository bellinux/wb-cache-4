5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Carnivores {{include both}} pack hunters and solitary hunters. The solitary hunter {{depends on a}} {{powerful}} bite at the canine teeth to subdue their prey, and thus exhibits a strong mandibular symphysis. In contrast, a pack hunter, which delivers many shallower bites, has a comparably weaker mandibular symphysis. Thus, researchers can use {{the strength of the}} mandibular symphysis in fossil carnivore specimens to determine what kind of hunter it wasa pack hunter or a solitary hunterand even how it consumed its prey. The mandibles of canids are buttressed behind the carnassial teeth to enable the animals to crack bones with their post-carnassial teeth (molars M2 and M3). A study found that the mandible buttress profile of the dire wolf was lower than that of the gray wolf and the red wolf, but very similar to the coyote and the African hunting dog. The dorsoventrally weak symphyseal region (in comparison to premolars P3 and P4) of the dire wolf indicates that it delivered shallow bites similar to its modern relatives and was therefore a pack hunter. This suggests that the dire wolf may have processed bone but was not as well adapted for it as was the gray wolf. The fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> of fracture for the dire wolf reduced in frequency in the late Pleistocene to that of its modern relatives suggests that reduced competition had allowed the dire wolf to return to a feeding behavior involving a lower amount of bone consumption, a behavior for which it was best suited.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To examine <b>the</b> {{rates of}} <b>incidence</b> and {{fatality}} in cohorts of patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer from 1975 to 1999.

Results: The study documents forms of rapidly evolving and fatal tumors as well as forms of tumor that evolve more slowly to cause death. It demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidences</b> of nonfatal forms of thyroid cancer have risen dramatically in the years from 1975 to 1999 —mostly due to papillary carcinomas—but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidences</b> of fatal forms of thyroid cancer have remained nearly constant...|$|R

25|$|The precise {{effect of}} the food crisis on German health and {{mortality}} has {{been a matter of}} some contention.

However, John Farquharson cites statistics indicating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>incidence</b> of hunger oedema was low in 1946–1947.
