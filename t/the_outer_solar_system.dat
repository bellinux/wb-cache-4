5|$|The {{results of}} <b>the</b> <b>Outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> Survey (OSSOS) {{suggests}} that the observed clustering {{is the result of}} a combination of observing bias and small number statistics. OSSOS, a well-characterized survey of <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> with known biases, observed eight trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU with orbits oriented on a wide range of directions. After accounting for the known observational biases of the survey, no evidence for the arguments of perihelion (ω) clustering identified by Trujillo and Sheppard was seen and the orientation of the orbits of the objects with the largest semi-major axis was statistically consistent with random. A previously released paper by Mike Brown analyzed the discovery locations of eccentric trans-Neptunian objects. While identifying some biases he found that even with these biases the clustering of longitudes of perihelion of the known objects would be observed only 1.2% of the time if their actual distribution was uniform.|$|E

40|$|The {{effective}} yield from a planetary regolith composed of approximately spherical grains is characterized {{in light of}} expressions for laboratory sputtering data. In {{the case of a}} fully-exposed regolith, the {{effective yield}} is of the order of 0. 4 - 1 times the measured yield at normal incidence; the range of variation for this value depends {{on the nature of the}} sputtering process employed. These results are applicable to such problems as the magnetospheric plasma sputtering of <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system's</b> icy satellites...|$|R
5|$|With over 400 active volcanos, Io is {{the most}} geologically active object in the Solar System. Its surface is dotted with more than 100 mountains, {{some of which are}} taller than Earth's Mount Everest. Unlike most {{satellites}} in <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> (which have a thick coating of ice), Io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide core.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> comets remain {{frozen and}} {{inactive}} and are extremely {{difficult or impossible}} to detect from Earth due to their small size. Statistical detections of inactive comet nuclei in the Kuiper belt have been reported from observations by the Hubble Space Telescope but these detections have been questioned. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them.|$|E
5|$|New {{concepts}} for {{missions to}} the Neptune {{system to be}} conducted in the 2010s have been brought forward by NASA scientists on numerous occasions over the last decades. All of them identified Triton as being a prime target and a separate Triton lander comparable to the Huygens probe for Titan was frequently included in those plans. No efforts aimed at Neptune and Triton went beyond the proposal phase and NASA's funding on missions to <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> is currently focused on the Jupiter and Saturn systems.|$|E

The use of the hydrogen maser frequency standards on the ground, in conjunction with thermally controlled quartz oscillators aboard the spacecraft, ensures long coherence intervals and allows the application of novel signal processing methods. On this basis, studies of atmospheric structure and scintillation parameters, planetary ring structure, and magnetic control of small ionospheric irregularities have been undertaken; information concerning planetary evolution, composition, and dynamics is thereby obtained...|$|R
5|$|Planet Nine is a {{hypothetical}} large planet in <b>the</b> far <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> <b>the</b> gravitational effects {{of which would}} explain the improbable orbital configuration {{of a group of}} trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) that orbit mostly beyond the Kuiper belt.|$|R
5|$|The outer {{region of}} the Solar System {{is home to the}} giant planets and their large moons. The centaurs and many short-period comets also orbit in this region. Due to their greater {{distance}} from the Sun, the solid objects in <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> contain a higher proportion of volatiles, such as water, ammonia, and methane than those of the inner Solar System because the lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid.|$|E
5|$|The {{planet is}} {{estimated}} to have 10 times the mass and two to four times the diameter of Earth. An object with the same diameter as Neptune has not been excluded by previous surveys. An infrared survey by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) in 2009 allowed for a Neptune-sized object beyond 700 AU. A similar study in 2014 focused on possible higher-mass bodies in <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> and ruled out Jupiter-mass objects out to 26,000 AU.|$|E
5|$|The planets were {{originally}} {{thought to have}} formed in or near their current orbits. However, this view underwent radical change during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Currently, {{it is thought that}} the Solar System looked very different after its initial formation: several objects at least as massive as Mercury were present in the inner Solar System, <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> was much more compact than it is now, and the Kuiper belt was much closer to the Sun.|$|E
50|$|All {{terrestrial}} planets (and some satellites, {{such as the}} Moon) {{are essentially}} composed of silicates wrapped around iron cores. <b>The</b> large <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> moons and Pluto have more ice, and less rock and metal, but still undergo analogous processes.|$|R

5|$|The study {{proposed}} a possible surface base on Callisto that would produce rocket propellant for further {{exploration of the}} Solar System. Advantages of a base on Callisto include low radiation (due to its distance from Jupiter) and geological stability. Such a base could facilitate remote exploration of Europa, or be an ideal location for a Jovian system waystation servicing spacecraft heading farther into <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> using a gravity assist from a close flyby of Jupiter after departing Callisto.|$|E
5|$|Neon's {{abundance}} {{in the universe}} is about 1 part in 750; in the Sun and presumably in the proto-solar system nebula, about 1 part in 600. The Galileo spacecraft atmospheric entry probe found {{that even in the}} upper atmosphere of Jupiter, the abundance of neon is reduced (depleted) by about a factor of 10, to a level of 1 part in 6,000 by mass. This may indicate that even the ice-planetesimals which brought neon into Jupiter from <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system,</b> formed in a region which was too warm to retain the neon atmospheric component (abundances of heavier inert gases on Jupiter are several times that found in the Sun).|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's evolution, comets were ejected out of the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, and sent {{thousands}} of AU outward to form the Oort cloud, a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by galactic tides, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into the inner Solar System. The evolution of <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> also appears to have been influenced by space weathering from the solar wind, micrometeorites, and the neutral components of the interstellar medium.|$|E

40|$|Radiometric {{data from}} the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecrafts have {{revealed}} an unexplained constant acceleration of a_A = (8. 74 +/- 1. 33) x 10 ^(- 10) m s^(- 2) towards the Sun, {{also known as the}} Pioneer anomaly. Different groups have analyzed the Pioneer data and have got the same results, which rules out computer programming and handling errors. Attempts to explain this phenomenon arguing intrinsic causes on-board the spacecrafts failed or have lead to inconclusive results.

5|$|The overall {{structure}} of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. <b>The</b> <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant planets. Since {{the discovery of the}} Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.|$|E
5|$|Comets are {{distinguished}} from asteroids {{by the presence}} of an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus. This atmosphere has parts termed the coma (the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus) and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from the coma by the Sun's light pressure or outstreaming solar wind plasma). However, extinct comets that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their volatile ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids. Asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets, having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> The discovery of main-belt comets and active centaur minor planets has blurred the distinction between asteroids and comets.|$|E
5|$|Harrington died in January 1993, {{without having}} found Planet X. Six months before, E. Myles Standish had used data from Voyager 2s 1989 flyby of Neptune, which had revised the planet's total mass {{downward}} by 0.5%—an amount {{comparable to the}} mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. When Neptune's newly determined mass {{was used in the}} Jet Propulsion Laboratory Developmental Ephemeris (JPL DE), the supposed discrepancies in the Uranian orbit, and with them the need for a PlanetX, vanished. There are no discrepancies in the trajectories of any space probes such as Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2 that {{can be attributed to the}} gravitational pull of a large undiscovered object in <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> Today, most astronomers agree that PlanetX, as Lowell defined it, does not exist.|$|E

5000|$|C/2011 L4 — astronomers at the University of Hawaii {{using the}} Pan-STARRS Telescope {{discovered}} comet C/2011 L4 in June 2011. At {{the time of}} discovery it was about 1.2 billion kilometers from the Sun, placing it beyond the orbit of Jupiter. The comet became {{visible to the naked}} eye when it was near perihelion in March 2013. It most likely originated in the Oort cloud, a cloud of comet-like objects located in <b>the</b> distant <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> It was probably gravitationally disturbed by a distant passing star, sending it on a long journey toward the Sun.|$|R
5|$|The {{exploration}} of Jupiter {{has been conducted}} via close observations by automated spacecraft. It began {{with the arrival of}} Pioneer 10 into the Jovian system in 1973, and, , has continued with eight further spacecraft missions. All of these missions were undertaken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and all but two have been flybys that take detailed observations without the probe landing or entering orbit. These probes make Jupiter the most visited of the Solar System's outer planets as all missions to <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> have used Jupiter flybys to reduce fuel requirements and travel time. On 5 July 2016, spacecraft Juno arrived and entered the planet's orbit—the second craft ever to do so. Sending a craft to Jupiter entails many technical difficulties, especially due to the probes' large fuel requirements and the effects of the planet's harsh radiation environment.|$|E
5|$|Halley is {{the most}} active of all the {{periodic}} comets, with others, such as Comet Encke and Comet Holmes, being one or two orders of magnitude less active. Its day side (the side facing the Sun) is far more active than the night side. Spacecraft observations showed that the gases ejected from the nucleus were 80% water vapor, 17% carbon monoxide and 3–4% carbon dioxide, with traces of hydrocarbons although more-recent sources give a value of 10% for carbon monoxide and also include traces of methane and ammonia. The dust particles {{were found to be}} primarily a mixture of carbon–hydrogen–oxygen–nitrogen (CHON) compounds common in <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> and silicates, such as are found in terrestrial rocks. The dust particles decreased in size down to the limits of detection (~0.001µm). The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the water released by Halley was initially thought to be similar to that found in Earth's ocean water, suggesting that Halley-type comets may have delivered water to Earth in the distant past. Subsequent observations showed Halley's deuterium ratio to be far higher than that found in Earth's oceans, making such comets unlikely sources for Earth's water.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the comets}} seen {{close to the}} Sun seem to have reached their current {{positions}} through gravitational perturbation of the Oort cloud by the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way. Just as the Moon's tidal force deforms Earth's oceans, causing the tides to rise and fall, the galactic tide also distorts the orbits of bodies in <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System.</b> In the charted regions of the Solar System, these effects are negligible compared to {{the gravity of the}} Sun, but in the outer reaches of the system, the Sun's gravity is weaker and the gradient of the Milky Way's gravitational field has substantial effects. Galactic tidal forces stretch the cloud along an axis directed toward the galactic centre and compress it along the other two axes; these small perturbations can shift orbits in the Oort cloud to bring objects close to the Sun. The point at which the Sun's gravity concedes its influence to the galactic tide is called the tidal truncation radius. It lies at a radius of 100,000 to 200,000 AU, and marks the outer boundary of the Oort cloud.|$|E

500|$|The Kreutz sungrazers ( [...] , {{pronounced}} kroits) are {{a family}} of sungrazing comets, characterized by orbits taking them extremely close to the Sun at perihelion.
