5|$|Aspinall {{worked closely}} with Epstein, who {{provided}} weekly notes for Aspinall <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> group's stage act, their concert appearances, and the fees they would receive. The Beatles had to travel in Aspinall's van along with their equipment, but British roads in the early 1960s were notoriously pot-holed and slow to navigate. Ringo Starr remembered that the travelling never seemed to stop during the early tours of Britain in Aspinall's van, as they would be driven up and down Great Britain {{with one of the}} group in the passenger seat, but with the other three on a hard bench seat in the back.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{opposition}} the Coffin family's {{desire to help}} the runaway slaves only increased. Coffin's wife, Catharine, who was also dedicated to the effort, organized a sewing society that met at their home to produce clothing <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> runaways. She also provided meals and shelter to runaway slaves in the Coffin home. Other aid was obtained from neighbors and others sympathetic to the cause, but were unwilling take the fugitives into their homes. Through these activities Coffin was able to secure {{a steady supply of}} goods to assist in the ongoing operations.|$|E

5|$|Men {{who worked}} for farmers or {{psychiatric}} hospitals received regular wages, which they were required <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> federal government. Objections to this practice developed immediately because the men felt they were helping to fund the war. A compromise was reached where the wages were put into a special fund that was unused until {{after the end of}} the war. At one point, church representatives attempted unsuccessfully to have these funds used for providing a living allowance for the men's dependents.|$|E
5|$|Si Ronda {{was adapted}} from a lenong (a Betawi oral {{tradition}} similar to a stage play) popular with ethnic Chinese and native audiences of the time. The Ronda stories follow the Betawi bandit of the same name, who is skilled at silat (traditional martial arts) and reputed to take from the rich <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poor. The Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran suggests that Ronda was selected for adaptation because of its potential action sequences. In the domestic cinema, such sequences had generally been inspired by American works and been well received by audiences.|$|E

5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: Minimum standards and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality of outcome. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unsuccessful.|$|E

Kelly passed it to one of his cousins <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woman. When McCormack confronted Kelly later that day, Kelly punched him in the nose, causing McCormack to fall.

25|$|Following the film's completion, Led Zeppelin had {{a falling}} out with Peter Clifton. Suspecting {{that he had}} 'stolen' negatives of the film, Grant ordered that his house be searched.

Clifton was also annoyed at the decision to remove from the film's credits the names of all the people who had worked on editing, make up and effects. Unlike Massot, however, Clifton was invited to both the New York and London premieres of the film.|$|E
25|$|New {{immigrants}} are also entitled to settlement assistance such as free language training under provincial government administered programs usually called Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LINC), {{for which the}} federal government budgeted about $350 million <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> provinces {{for the fiscal year}} 2006-2007. The majority of the $350 million was allocated to Quebec under the Canada-Quebec Accord, at $196 million per year, even though immigration to Quebec represented only 16.5% of all immigration to Canada in 2005. The $350 million is budgeted to increase by an additional $90 million by 2009. Provincial governments in Canada have established citizenship and immigration departments, such as the Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration (Ontario).|$|E

25|$|For decades thereafter, {{passports}} {{were issued}} {{not only by}} the Department of State but also by states and cities, and by notaries public. For example, an internal passport dated 1815 was presented to Massachusetts citizen George Barker to allow him to travel as a free black man to visit relatives in Southern slave states. Passports issued by American authorities other than the Department of State breached propriety and caused confusion abroad. Some European countries refused to recognize passports not issued by the Department of State, unless United States consular officials endorsed them. The problems led the Congress in 1856 <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Department of State the sole authority to issue passports.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} fourteen, Lúcia {{was sent}} to the school of the Sisters of St. Dorothy (Dorothean) in Vilar, a suburb of Porto, Portugal.

Lúcia continued to report private visions periodically throughout her life. She reported seeing the Virgin Mary again in 1925 in the convent. This time she said she was asked to convey the message of the First Saturdays Devotion. She said that a subsequent vision of Christ as a child reiterated this request. In 1929, Lúcia reported that Mary returned and repeated her request for the Consecration of Russia to her Immaculate Heart. She also reported an apparition in Rianxo, Galicia, in 1931, in which she said that Jesus visited her, taught her two prayers, and delivered a message <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church's hierarchy.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to calm Ray, William tells him {{the secret of the}} medallion, not believing the Gold to be real. However, he is shocked when he learns it is, and they {{encounter}} Thomas and Marisa in the chambers. The opening scene repeats, with the two brothers facing off against one another. However, William steps between them, telling Ray he won't allow him to kill Thomas. He pretends he is about to draw a gun, and Ray shoots him. In actuality he was taking out his bible. The chamber is then attacked by Barnsby, who Running River chose not to kill. After killing all of his men, the McCalls face Barnsby, shooting him dead. Coming to believe the legend that the Gold is cursed, the McCalls and Marisa leave it behind. William's sacrifice compels Ray to renounce violence, and become a priest. He then marries Thomas and Marisa, and the three head to a small town in Texas, with Marisa pregnant with Mendoza's child. She carries the medallion as an amulet, which she plans <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> child when he is born.|$|E
