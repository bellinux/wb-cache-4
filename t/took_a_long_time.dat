5|$|After {{delivery}} of the barium-lanthanum material to Los Alamos, it was stored in a dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site. At first, the mixture was used as-is, both barium and lanthanum together, but this led to unpleasant radioactive contamination that <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to disappear as the half-life of barium-140 is 12.5 days. Shortly after, the process was improved; barium was removed chemically, by double precipitation from a solution as barium sulfate.|$|E
5|$|Saman was {{released}} in 1998 after winning the 1997 Jakarta Art Institute novel writing contest. In 1998, Saman won the Jakarta Arts Council Novel Competition. In 2000, it received the Prince Claus Award. By 2005, it had been translated into Dutch and English; the English translation <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to write because Utami was concerned that an overexplanation of the novel caused it to lose all of its sensuality. It has also been translated into French, Czech, and Japanese (by two separate translators). , a translation into Korean is underway. By 2004, the book had sold 100,000 copies, a large figure for an Indonesian novel.|$|E

5|$|Southern Rhodesia was {{regarded}} as an ideal location for air training {{for a number of}} reasons. It was far from the hostilities, firmly pro-British and had excellent weather throughout the year. The British Air Ministry resolved to outsource training to the colony amid some urgency in late 1939 after EATS <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to get going in Canada. The RATG was the last EATS group to be formed, but the first to start training airmen; it also turned out fully qualified pilots before any of the others, doing so {{for the first time in}} November 1940.|$|E
5|$|Despite its shorter term {{political}} benefits, the South Vietnamese {{government also}} had {{complaints about the}} way the Americans set up the CIP. Diem and Nhu claimed that the paperwork involved in the applications for imports made the process was too slow and hindered the development of an emerging economy where the market situation changed rapidly. In particular, any investment in capital goods by importers that cost more than USD500,000 needed a formal American review before approval. Nhu also publicly criticized the review policy on several occasions, citing several private infrastructure investments that were blocked by American administrators. Nhu and Diem felt that the regulations that the Americans put {{on the use of the}} piaster fund obtained from Vietnamese importers were stifling their ability to accelerate development, especially as the planning and approval reviews <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mona had booked the Les Stewart Quartet to {{play the}} opening night with Harrison on guitar, but they {{cancelled}} the booking after Stewart and Brown had a quarrel. Stewart was angry that Brown had missed a rehearsal, because Brown was helping Mona to decorate the club. As 300 membership cards had already been sold, Harrison {{said that he had}} two friends in a band called The Quarrymen who would play instead. Lennon, McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe and Harrison went to the club to arrange the booking, to which Mona agreed, but said she needed to finish painting the club first. All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders, dragons, rainbows, stars, and a beetle, which still survive. John Lennon was short-sighted, mistaking gloss for emulsion paint, which <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to dry in the dark, damp cellar. Cynthia Powell, later the wife of Lennon, painted a silhouette of John Lennon on the wall, which is also still intact.|$|E

5|$|The Corporal had {{numerous}} limitations. It <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to set up, {{so it could}} not engage targets of opportunity; there could be delays in the countdown process, which {{made it hard to}} warn the troops to close their eyes or aircraft to avoid the area; and it was guided by a radio beam that not only could be jammed, but could actually be diverted. Moreover, during test firings in the Outer Hebrides, although eight out of twelve missiles accurately hit their targets, four fell short, which is always regrettable but particularly so when nuclear weapons are involved in view of the danger it posed to one's own troops. A new British project was therefore launched to develop a better missile, codenamed Blue Water, which was to have used the British Indigo Hammer and later the Tony warhead.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, after Sakurai {{was given}} the go-ahead to develop Uprising, he rented out an office in Takadanobaba, a {{district}} of Tokyo. At this stage, due to the game's platform still being in early development, there were no development tools available for Sakurai to use. Between November and March 2009, Sakurai finalized his vision for the game. During this period, to help design the game's settings and characters, Sakurai hired several outside illustrators to work on concept art: these artists were Toshio Noguchi, Akifumi Yamamoto and Masaki Hirooka. The art style was inspired by manga. In January 2009, development studio Project Sora was established for Uprisings development. At its inception, it had a staff of 30. With the start of active recruitment in March 2009, the game officially entered development: at the time, {{it was the very}} first game to be in development for the new platform. During this early stage, {{due to the lack of}} platform specific development tools, the team were developing the game on Wii hardware and personal computers. The changing specifications of the developing hardware resulted in multiple features undergoing major revisions. This hardware instability led to a protracted development cycle: in the event, the team managed to fully utilize the platform's capabilities, doing detailed work on how many enemies they could show on the screen at any one time. Debugging also <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> due to the size and variability of gameplay built into Uprising.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{music in}} North Georgia, including {{what is now}} Athens, {{was that of the}} Native Americans of the area, principally the Creek and the Cherokee. Athens was officially chartered in 1806, and began growing rapidly near the middle of the 19th century. By the time of the American Civil War in the 1860s, the city was an important part of musical life in Georgia. The war accelerated the development of the city's musical importance, as Athens was largely spared widespread destruction while the larger city of Atlanta <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to recover. Major touring acts like the Dixie Family and The Slomans visited Athens during the war; the Dixie Family, a prominent touring group, performed disastrously, according to local newspapers, who said that the highlight of the performance came from four local African American musicians, and the Dixie Family had absconded with the concert's proceeds, which had been promised to the local Ladies Aid Society. In the 1870s, the city was almost half African American, and local black-owned industry flourished; among the residents was Bob Cole, born in 1868 to a musically active family. Cole would later become a pioneer in African American theater, known for works like the 1898 musical A Trip to Coontown.|$|E
