5|$|As {{the others}} plot to destroy <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> with improvised gas bombs and flares, Corcoran flees {{the station and}} finds <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> in a nearby cave. After {{consuming}} Wyman's brain, <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> is now able {{to speak with the}} scientist's voice and has absorbed his knowledge. Corcoran asks whether Wyman's death was needed, but <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> insists it was a necessary sacrifice. The others arrive to destroy <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> but hesitate because Corcoran will not step aside and let them throw their bombs. <b>The</b> <b>creature</b> insists it is not an evil monster, but an intelligent alien who has come to Earth to save the human race from its own self-destructive tendencies. It explains that Corcoran's body has been implanted with its embryos, which will allow the alien species to multiply and take over the human race, which <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> claims {{is the only way to}} truly save humanity. Upon realizing <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> is forcing the will of its species on the human race, Corcoran concludes <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> is evil after all and commits suicide so its embryos cannot come to fruition. The others then throw their explosives and kill <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> which in its dying breaths warns that others from his species are waiting in space and will return one day to conquer humanity.|$|E
5|$|Ernie says Scully is now marked and <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> will {{go after}} her too. When his ground radar goes off, Scully goes outside.

5|$|The team {{tries to}} call for further assistance, but find the radio is no longer working. Randall heads outside to check the power transformers, and is {{attacked}} by a large creature (Ross Sturlin) hiding in the underbrush around the station. Randall fires a few shots at <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> with his pistol and escapes unscathed. Although {{he did not get}} a good look at <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> he describes it to the rest of the team as similar in size to a bear. Later, the team finds the infirmary has been trashed and Corcoran's body is gone. They initially believe <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> has broken in and stole the corpse, but are shocked to instead find Corcoran has mysteriously regained consciousness. Upon checking his blood again, there is no trace of the mysterious cells from before, but after investigating Corcoran's body, they find the cells have changed into lizard-like fetuses and entered into his abdominal cavity. <b>The</b> <b>creature</b> later breaks into the lab again, this time beheading Dr. Wyman. Randall and Dunlap are initially suspicious that Corcoran was involved in the death, which he denies, but it appears he has some sort of telepathic connection with <b>the</b> <b>creature.</b> Despite Wyman's death, Corcoran does not believe <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> is evil, but rather simply misunderstood. He implores the others to give <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> a chance to explain its actions, and asks that they not condemn it as a monster simply because it is different.|$|E

When he returns with the welts {{all over his}} throat, George Vincent slams the door and takes them all hostage, leaving Mulder {{to die in the}} hallway. Angela goes into labor and Scully finds herself forced to deliver a baby. However, water collects in the light fixture above them and <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> appears. It grabs George Vincent by the neck. Scully tells Walter Suarez to aim for the sprinklers, realizing that the freshwater kept <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> at bay, as with the deputy until Epsom salt was added to the water. Suarez shoots the sprinklers and saves Vincent's life. Meanwhile, Mulder realizes that freshwater is the key also, and runs out into the rain to heal his wounds.|$|E
5|$|Doggett {{goes off}} alone {{to see the}} woman who guarded <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> in the woods. The woman implies that Mulder, feeling sorry for <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> was trying to euthanize <b>the</b> <b>creature,</b> not save Hangemuhl. Doggett hears a noise and finds a trap door leading into the tunnels. Underground, he finds Hangemuhl and takes her to the hospital. Skinner checks in with Doggett who reports that Hangemuhl's kidneys have healed spontaneously. Doggett returns to {{the woman in the}} woods who watches over the creature; after {{recoiling}} at its ugliness, the woman explains that it looks the way it does because it takes the sickness of others into itself, while healing them in the process. Doggett decides to take <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> away from the society, which only uses it. However, Doggett is shot and killed in a scuffle with the sheriff and is promptly buried. Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman kneels beside the dead soul eater. She weeps over it, revealing that, by eating Doggett's death, it has finally been allowed to die.|$|E
5|$|During an autopsy, Scully {{correctly}} deduces that Arlen was {{blinded by}} reptile venom. Meanwhile, Doggett and Harrison, having fallen into old bootlegger tunnels below the mansion grounds, encounter <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> and are sprayed with venom, temporarily blinding them. The two find Gary Sacks {{in dire need}} of medical attention nearby. Noting Doggett and Harrison's absence, Mulder searches the area around the mansion for clues and encounters the owner, Herman Stites, who identifies himself as a biologist. Mulder soon leaves the area as Stites notices Doggett about to escape the tunnels and knocks him back in. Mulder waits in his car in Stites' driveway until dark, telling Scully that he found the Apollo medallion near Stites' estate and is convinced Doggett is somewhere nearby. He spots <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> and chases it to the mansion where it climbs up to a second floor. Mulder follows <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> into the house and down into the tunnels, where he encounters Harrison and Doggett. With <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> approaching, Mulder tells the still-blinded Doggett to open fire at him on his command.

5|$|Lionhead Studios used Michael Bratman's belief–desire–intention {{model to}} {{simulate}} creatures' learning {{and decision making}} processes. A creature forms an intention by combining desires, opinions, and beliefs. Beliefs are attributed to lists that store data about various world objects. Desires are goals <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> wants to fulfill, expressed as simplified perceptrons. Opinions describe ways of satisfying a desire using decision trees. For each desire, <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> selects the belief with the best opinion, thus forming an intention or goal.|$|E

50|$|High-voltage {{electrification}} (from {{a battery}} system devised by Bartell) is utilized {{in an attempt}} to slay the monsters. Bartell explains that he has been tracking these creatures and attempting to cultivate them to sell as biological weapons. It is soon discovered that electrical shocks increase the creatures' powers. The high voltage causes <b>the</b> numerous smaller <b>creatures</b> to join into a larger conglomeration. By accident, the survivors stumble upon <b>the</b> solution. <b>The</b> <b>creatures</b> devour flesh but not blood, as in each case where remains have been found blood has been present. Bartell surmises that <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> have a negative reaction to hemoglobin and, when directly injected with it, <b>the</b> <b>creatures</b> are indeed slain. Following a struggle Bartell is killed just before Murdoch destroys the last of <b>the</b> <b>creatures.</b>|$|R

5|$|To {{implement}} {{the transformation of}} <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> based on its alignment, Alex Evans developed an exporter program to export 3D Studio Max's models and animations, and Roberts created one to import them and apply them to the lion.

The system has a two-way blend: one for the alignment, and the other for how fat <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> is. As there {{was not going to be}} many creatures on one map, the team were able to use CPU resources to run many animations simultaneously on a single creature.|$|E

Walter explains he believes <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> is a man-made chimera, which has the best genetic traits of many different creatures, including a lizard, bat, and wasp. He had tried to create <b>the</b> <b>creature</b> years before, but his experiments failed, and concludes that someone else must have taken up his research. Though initially thinking Charlie was healthy after the attack, they realize the chimera's stinger injected him with its larvae, {{and that he has}} less than 24 hours to live.|$|E
