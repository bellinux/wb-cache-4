5|$|<b>The</b> <b>porch</b> {{is located}} {{at the top of the}} facade. The central bays of <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> were built by the Knights Templar during the First Crusade, but Saladin's nephew al-Mu'azzam Isa ordered the {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> itself in 1217.|$|E
5|$|The two-story brick {{structure}} {{is supported by}} a fieldstone foundation and still features its original front porch. <b>The</b> <b>porch</b> spans the length of the building's front (south) facade, at a height of about 6feet (1.8m). <b>The</b> <b>porch</b> is supported by four wooden pillars, which rest on stone bases. The stairs leading to the front porch are supported by two similar wooden posts, which, like the house, are set into fieldstone bases. The first step on the stairs was originally a limestone block embedded in the ground. <b>The</b> <b>porch</b> roof is supported by six wooden, bracketed pillars. The pillars are simple, with the brackets coming from the boxed capitals. At the rear of <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> wooden pilasters set at each end help to support the roof. Differentiating the home from the traditional French Colonial design is <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> roof, which is separate from the main roof.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} {{clerestory}} {{was added to}} the nave, along with the Perpendicular two-storied south porch; these reconstruction works necessitated the repositioning of the door on the south aisle, and the building of the present-day western wall of the nave, with a great window and door also in the Perpendicular style. Stained glass windows were installed in the clerestory, but their contents were not recorded, and only small fragments of the mediaeval glass survive today: the arms of the Cheyne family, a human figure, and a shield with fragments of coloured glass, possibly the impaled arms of Woburn and Leicester. A staircase in <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> led to a parvise above; local tradition holds that Thomas Harding was held in the parvise prior to his execution in 1532. <b>The</b> <b>porch</b> also contains a stoup dating from the late 14th century, which although much damaged has survived all subsequent restorations and remodellings unaltered.|$|E

5|$|The stone {{addition}} exhibits {{two stories}} of deep verandas extending across its eastern front façade. These verandas were once supported by tall columns rising from <b>the</b> addition's ground-level <b>porch,</b> to <b>the</b> roof of <b>the</b> second-story <b>porch.</b> An exterior stairway once connected <b>the</b> lower <b>porch</b> to <b>the</b> upper <b>porch.</b>|$|R
5|$|Six {{victims of}} the {{shooting}} were carried to <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of the Brewer house, which was shaded by a tall oak tree. The tree became famously known as the Tragedy Oak.

5|$|The Burnside Memorial Hall in Bristol, Rhode Island, is {{a two-story}} Richardson Romanesque public {{building}} on Hope Street. It was dedicated in 1883 by President Chester A. Arthur and Governor Augustus O. Bourn. Originally, {{a statue of}} Burnside {{was intended to be}} the focus of <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> The architect was Stephen C. Earle.|$|E
5|$|The Cutts-Madison House (721 Madison Place NW), {{also known}} as the Dolley Madison House, was {{constructed}} in 1822 by Richard Cutts, brother-in-law of First Lady Dolley Madison. After ex-President James Madison died in 1836, Dolley Madison took up residency in the house and lived there until her death in 1849. Rear Admiral Charles Wilkes purchased the home in 1851. Wilkes moved the entrance from Madison Place NW to H Street NW, and turned <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> {{on the west side of}} the house (facing Madison Place NW) into a window. Witnesses from the mid-19th century onward have claimed to have seen the ghost of Dolley Madison rocking in a chair in the space where <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> used to be, smiling at passersby.|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} side of {{the church}} has nine bays, again divided by buttresses. In the third bay from the west is a porch. The other bays each contain a two-light window with trefoil heads. <b>The</b> <b>porch</b> is in two storeys, with angle buttresses and a battlemented parapet with gargoyles. The lower storey contains a doorway with a pointed arch, and the upper storey has a two-light window. The doorway and window are set slightly {{to the west of}} the centre, as the east wall contains a stairway. Inside <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> are stone seats and the remains of two stoups (holy water fonts). The staircase leading to the upper storey is composed of old gravestones. On the outer wall of the upper storey is a sundial. The west end of the church is in Perpendicular style, and has five bays. At its centre is another porch, this one with three storeys. At the west front are diagonal buttresses, and in the bottom storey is a double doorway, over which is a canopied niche containing the weathered image of a saint. In the middle storey is a three-light window, in the top storey a two-light window, and at the summit is a battlemented parapet. There are windows in the north and south faces of the top stage, and on the north side is an octagonal stair turret. Inside <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> are four corbels (supporting brackets) carved with musicians. On each side of <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> is a four-light window. At the west end of the north aisle is a four-light window, and a five-light window is at the end of the south aisle.|$|E
5|$|A bronze-covered door, {{with relief}} panels {{depicting}} figures, opens onto the entrance hall. In Burges's time {{the door had}} a letterbox, {{in the form of}} Mercury, the messenger of the gods. The letterbox is now lost, but a contemporary copy is in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum. <b>The</b> <b>porch</b> contains a white marble seat and column, and on the floor is a mosaic of Pinkie, a favourite poodle of Burges.

5|$|Constructed in 1878, the Foster–Payne House is {{a two-story}} {{home with a}} {{low-pitched}} multi-gabled roof. The house has a single story open porch on the western side, a kitchen ell that projects from the rear and a single-story bay window that projects from the western bay of the front facade. The house is distinguished by its clapboard exterior and wooden trim under the gable peaks, the window trim and <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> brackets. There are three types of windows used on the house, single and paired one-over-one windows and two-over-two windows.|$|E
5|$|Dominating the {{appearance}} of the house from the street is a large verandah-style porch, supported by large stone columns, on the southern-facing front of the house; an enclosed porch, smaller but two stories high and supported by wooden pillars, is located on the rear portion of the house's east side. Projecting {{from the front of the}} house, above <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> is a small wing with a gable, semicircular window, and elaborate cornice. The house is built in a combination of styles; it includes many Italianate details, but its design appears to have been influenced by the architecture of the Sears Modern Homes.|$|E
5|$|Eva and {{her ex-husband}} take Ellen {{to the airport}} for her flight to college. A few months later, on Thanksgiving Day, Eva drives by Albert's home and {{stops in front of}} the house on her way to pick up Ellen from the airport. He sees her and she awkwardly waves. He {{eventually}} comes outside, to Eva's surprise, and sits with her on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> while they begin to renew their relationship.|$|E
50|$|The {{house has}} two formal entrances with <b>porches.</b> <b>The</b> <b>porches</b> are {{supported}} by Doric columns that are clustered at the outer corners and paired and engaged at the house. The main entrance is on the east elevation on Palmetto Street and the family entrance is {{on the north side}} on Edgemont Street. There is <b>porch</b> on <b>the</b> south elevation. In 1970, this <b>porch</b> was enclosed. <b>The</b> small <b>porch</b> on <b>the</b> west elevation was also enclosed with vinyl siding about the same time.

5|$|Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine (1635–1708) oversaw a {{substantial}} remodelling {{of the house}} in 1684, and much of the existing south facade dates from that time. The end bays were heightened, and the central porch was rebuilt with stone quoins and pilasters, a balustraded top and a small tower and cupola. A plan from 1684 shows the hall in the house's centre, with service rooms to the west and the main parlour to the east. On the first floor, the dining room was over the hall, the main bedchamber over the kitchen, and a lady's chamber over <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} floor of the home the rooms remain much the same as they were when Glidden lived in the house. An {{original}} multi-paneled wooden door remains at the entry from <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> to the central hall. The door, however, was altered, having glass panels installed to admit more light. The staircase is also original and its newel posts resemble those found in the Isaac and Harriet Ellwood House, another Haish designed home, and the Gurler House, whose architect is unknown though it was quite possibly Haish, both in DeKalb.|$|E
5|$|On the house's {{east side}} are three rooms, whose {{original}} presence {{is open to}} debate. The three rooms are interconnected, another common French colonial element. The room adjacent <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> {{was used as the}} Glidden's dining room and is where the large brick fireplace, which replaced the marble one in 1909, is located. The 1909 fireplace is of the American Craftsman style. At the end of the hall, near the kitchen, there is a full bathroom.|$|E
