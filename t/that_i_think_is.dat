25|$|On February 5, Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Laila Freivalds {{stated the}} {{following}} in an interview: We support {{the freedom of}} speech, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> very clear. But {{at the same time}} it is important to say that with this freedom comes a certain responsibility, and it could be objectionable to act in a way that insults people.|$|E
500|$|... "Polkarama!", {{a medley}} of popular hit songs set to a polka beat, was {{recorded}} during the second parody session. Yankovic explained that, [...] "if there’s a song <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> really ripe for parody but I just can’t think of a clever enough idea, sometimes it’ll {{end up in the}} polka medley." [...] Regarding their popularity, Yankovic has said, [...] "At this point, it's sort of mandatory for me to do a polka medley. Fans would be rioting in the streets, I think, if I didn't do a polka medley." ...|$|E
500|$|When a CBC Radio {{interviewer}} {{suggested to}} Franklin that her ideas about {{peace and justice}} were not connected with what was actually happening {{in the aftermath of}} 9/11, she [...] readily agreed. [...] "Yes, you are quite right. They are totally unconnected. I have spent the best part of my life trying to put these thoughts into the stream that makes decisions, and I've been spectacularly unsuccessful. <b>That,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> a reflection on my ability in the climate of the time, not on the value of the thoughts." ...|$|E
60|$|When I came to I was alone. I had a dim {{consciousness}} {{of having been}} shaken by several hands, of a voice <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> Scrymgeour's saying <b>that</b> he would often write to me--though my new home was to be within the four-mile radius--and of another voice <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> Jimmy's, telling Marriot not to let me see him breaking down. But though I had ceased to puff, my brier was still in my mouth; and, indeed, I found it there when William John shook me into life next morning.|$|R
5000|$|John Lydon (2004): “There's a few b-sides <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>were</b> {{never really}} heard properly, things like 'Blue Water', when {{we used a}} skip in the beat, almost a 4-4-2 step.” ...|$|R

500|$|The team {{attempted}} to develop characters {{that offer a}} unique experience to the game. [...] "The overarching goal for us was about building an ensemble of genuinely interesting characters we wanted to interact with," [...] said Matthies. They also strived to connect the thoughts and actions of all characters to the human experience, allowing players to know [...] "why a person is doing what they are doing". Matthies feels that all characters, particularly the allies, contain some dimension of his own personality. [...] "They're an expression of something {{that is part of}} me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> interesting to explore," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|... "What You Want" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee, Terry Balsamo, and Tim McCord in New York City and the {{production}} was handled by Nick Raskulinecz. During an interview with MTV News in June, Lee talked about the song saying, [...] " [...] the song <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> the first single is the song that wraps it all up. It's got a cool meaning, {{a lot of great}} lyrics going on, it also just smacks you right in the face and it's heavy and it's great." [...] She noted that the song was a departure from the band's previous material and acknowledged that they wanted the new single to be [...] "more than a hit".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} several {{works of}} classical music at a concert meant to feature music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. While the first is Mozart's String Quartet No.19 in C-Major, the second piece is String Sextet No.1 by Johannes Brahms. The rest of the episode was scored by Dennis McCarthy; [...] "Sarek" [...] {{was one of several}} episodes on which he worked. Story editor Ronald D. Moore thought that [...] "Sarek" [...] was better than [...] "Journey to Babel", and it allowed Lenard to do some [...] "solid acting". Director Les Landau also praised Lenard's performance, saying that a moment when a tear rolls down Sarek's face was portrayed as [...] "something special". He added that the dynamics in the mind meld scene reached [...] "a level <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> classic in Star Trek history", describing Stewart's performance as [...] "truly spectacular". The mind meld scene was shot in a single take.|$|E
5000|$|..... I {{experienced}} some loss <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hadn’t really touched before. And {{people who were}} close to me are no long there or no longer close to me ... the things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> worth fighting for and believe in, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>are</b> still the same ... Maybe, if anything, I’ve got more doubts.|$|R

500|$|The {{telecast}} {{also received}} unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures. In {{an interview with}} Los Angeles Daily News author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the [...] "Year of the Woman" [...] theme commenting, [...] "It had no basis in reality. On behalf of women directors, cinematographer, and producers, I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute." [...] Likewise, President of the National Organization for Women's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony's feminist tribute as [...] "one of the most hypocritical, patronizing things I saw in my whole life." [...] In response, Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating, [...] "The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> positive, {{not only for the}} individual in general but for individual women specifically." [...] He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying, [...] "It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness" ...|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{designed}} Two-Face's {{appearance in}} the film {{as one of the}} least disturbing, explaining, [...] "When we looked at less extreme versions of it, they were too real and more horrifying. When you look at a film like Pirates of the Caribbean– something like that, there's something about a very fanciful, very detailed visual effect, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> more powerful and less repulsive." [...] Framestore created 120 computer-generated shots of Two-Face's scarred visage. Nolan felt using make-up would look unrealistic, as it adds to the face, unlike real burn victims. Framestore acknowledged they rearranged the positions of bones, muscles and joints to make the character look more dramatic. For each shot, three 720-pixel HD cameras were set up at different angles on set to fully capture Aaron Eckhart's performance. Eckhart wore markers on his face and a prosthetic skullcap, which acted as a lighting reference. A few shots of the skullcap were kept in the film. Framestore also integrated shots of Bale and Eckhart into that of the exploding building where Dent is burned. It was difficult simulating fire on Eckhart because it is inherently unrealistic for only half of something to burn.|$|E
500|$|Robyn was {{involved}} in the writing process for the entirety of My Truth, co-writing all fourteen tracks. She teamed up with Swedish rapper Petter for a Swedish-language duet titled [...] "Det gör ont ibland". The collaboration came about when the two were at a friend's country house. Petter said the song came together quickly, despite their different musical styles. The track was produced by rapper Thomas Rusiak with additional production by Robyn, Lindström and Ekhé. She recorded another duet for the album, titled [...] "Healthy Love", with singer Cindy Heinold. In the fall of 1998, Robyn had an abortion, which she revealed to the public months later in an issue of Café Magazine. Following the abortion, she penned the songs [...] "88 Days" [...] and [...] "Giving You Back", to help her cope with the incident. At the time of the album's completion, she deemed the latter among the best songs she had written thus far. She began using songwriting as a coping mechanism during production of Robyn Is Here when she wrote [...] "In My Heart" [...] about her parents' divorce. She wanted My Truth to be positive in spirit, but acknowledged there is [...] "some sadness expressed". She said, [...] "Every song is about something I've been through <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> important to talk about. I have tried to turn these experiences into inspiring songs about my life." [...] Eric Broms photographed the artwork for My Truth, which sees Robyn wearing a feather headpiece designed by Sebastian Wahl.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes!" [...] He, on his side, {{more and}} more visibly nervous, had a tone to master; {{but he was so}} much more {{successful}} than <b>I</b> <b>that,</b> laughing out through his gravity, he could pretend we were pleasantly jesting. [...] "Only <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>was</b> to get me to do something for YOU!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In one {{interview}} {{in which he}} was asked if he would condemn the KKK and Adolf Hitler, he refused, saying [...] "I’m not going to play this game," [...] while stating that Hitler had [...] "done things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> despicable," [...] without elaborating on which things he was referring to.|$|R
5000|$|More recently, in 2009, Johnson stated <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> there <b>is</b> an anti-jihadist {{movement}} anymore. ... It's all a {{bunch of}} kooks. I’ve watched some people who I thought were reputable, and who I trusted, hook up with racists and Nazis. I {{see a lot of}} them promoting stories and causes <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> completely nuts.|$|R
500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E
500|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Hunt as [...] "confident", [...] "innovative", [...] "intelligent", {{while he}} {{also can be}} [...] "aggressive", [...] "brazen", [...] "presumptuous", [...] "hasty and rash". McKidd said of his character: [...] " [...] He's not an easy character to connect to, I think. There's some darkness to him and there's some danger to him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> really interesting and exciting to play. [...] " [...] Additionally, McKidd describes Hunt as [...] "very instinctive, and follows his gut, and he's very impulsive, and very immediate. He immediately assesses a situation. And he's very honest, sometimes painfully honest, with himself and with others. He wants to make himself better. He wants to improve himself as a person. He's a decent guy, {{a sort of a}} guy I'd like to go out and have a beer with." [...] Hunt's unorthodox teaching methods {{have been the subject of}} controversy. McKidd said of this: [...] The look of Owen has been described as hardcore and the antithesis of the other males on the show. McKidd says it's not just the look of Owen, but the fact that in his profession, he is dealing with life and death everyday. The one distinction he finds between his character and the others is that Owen does not care what other people think of him. When McKidd returned from his first appearance, his character appeared to have been changed. McKidd told TV Guide: [...] "Yes, that was who he really is in the premiere, but now we're seeing what can happen to a good man, a good soldier and good surgeon [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Garland, who has {{explored}} science fiction themes {{in some of}} his previous work, was a sounding board for ideas for the novel and an early reader of the book. Ishiguro stated that, despite Garland's screenwriting skills and previous experience with film, they did not discuss the idea of a film until after the novel was complete. [...] "I {{try not to think about}} things like that when writing a novel—in fact, quite the reverse", he stated. He said that he attempts to [...] "go for something... very interior, following thoughts and memories, something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> difficult to do on the screen, which is essentially a third-person medium." [...] Thus he was surprised when Garland, after reading a complete version of the book, said he would like to try to adapt it. Ishiguro recalled that Garland wrote a draft very quickly and immediately asked of his opinion of it [...] "as a first go". Ishiguro was very satisfied with Garland's screenplay—which was changed very little from its initial draft to the filmed version—and with the final film. When asked to compare the experience with that of The Remains of the Day, he acknowledged that both were more hands-on with this film. Romanek said that he did not make Never Let Me Go a science fiction film; rather, he was presenting a love story with fictional science context mixed in. He described the film as telling a [...] "love story where the science fiction is this subtle patina on the story." [...] The filmmaker explained that had they done the film with [...] "science fiction-y things", it would have been more openly, with props such as futuristic structures and devices.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2011, Dent {{voted in}} favor of a 2012 budget {{proposal}} authored by Paul Ryan entitled The Path to Prosperity, which included several controversial changes to both health care and tax policy.

2500|$|Miller {{later said}} of his peak period in the mid-1970s: [...] "When I won at Tucson by nine shots in 1975, I would say the average iron shot I hit that week {{was no more than}} two feet off line. It was unbelievable. When I was at my peak, I would go into streaks where I felt that I could knock down the pin from {{anywhere}} with my irons. I played some golf <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> unequaled." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{he retired}} in December 2004, the AP News Service quoted Moyers as saying, [...] "I'm going out telling the story <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> the biggest story of our time: how the right-wing media has become a {{partisan}} propaganda arm of the Republican National Committee. We have an ideological press that's interested in the election of Republicans, and a mainstream press that's interested in the bottom line. Therefore, we don't have a vigilant, independent press whose interest is the American people." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his 1854 book [...] "The Cruise of the Steam Yacht North Star" [...] John Choules {{described}} Southampton thus: [...] "I {{hardly know}} {{a town that}} can show a more beautiful Main Street than Southampton, except it be Oxford.
