30|$|For each of {{the three}} {{different}} <b>treatment</b> <b>types</b> (i.e., referral, invitation, and automatic referral), two effects are estimated, an immediate effect and a long-term effect. The immediate effect is the change in the exit rate to employment {{at the end of the}} month in which the treatment was imposed (and in the following month). The results at the left hand side of Table  3 indicate that the immediate effect for the three different <b>treatment</b> <b>types</b> are respectively 0.55, 0.31, and 0.06, suggesting that the treatment effect is positive for all <b>treatment</b> <b>types</b> (albeit very small for the automatic referral). However, in this specification, selection on unobservables has not yet been taken into account, and as mentioned in the previous section, this can cause a bias with an a priori unknown sign. The unobserved heterogeneity terms at the bottom of Table  3 indicate that there is a strong negative correlation between the unobserved terms of both hazards, suggesting that persons who get treated are on average less employable than persons who do not get the treatment. This implies that a specification that does not control for unobserved heterogeneity underestimates the treatment effect. In what follows, we will therefore focus on the results of the specifications that do correct for selection on unobservables.|$|R

In the literature on music and stress, empirical findings are typically grouped together according to the method in which they are gathered. There are two main methods of gathering data that yield the empirical findings discussed below. Studies of this <b>treatment</b> <b>type</b> have been looked at from a purely psychological perspective (based on patient responses to survey questions), as well as a more physiological perspective (often making use of more invasive methods of study). Despite the fact that different methods are used, most of these studies demonstrate that different types of music are associated with different effects on the mood of the depressed/stressed individual.|$|E
5000|$|Those that oppose data {{discrimination}} {{say that}} it hurts {{the growth of the}} Internet, as well as the economy that is rooted into the depths of the Internet model. “Instead of promoting competition, such picking of winners and losers will stifle the investment needed to perpetuate the Internet's phenomenal growth, hurting the economy.“If, for example, telecommunication network operators blocked data packets of Voice-over-IP services that might substitute their own telephone services, this would not only discriminate against speciﬁc ﬁrms, but also reduce competition and economic welfare. Technically, this would not be a problem. Although data packets are homogeneous with respect to switching and transmission <b>treatment,</b> <b>type,</b> source, and destination can be revealed and data packets be handled differently if a network operator prefers to do so. Another problem is that the type of data that is given preferential treatment is up to the discretion of the ISP.

This goes against the first amendment, the freedom of speech because by stopping certain kinds of information from reaching the end user, they are censoring content.

50|$|The most {{important}} skill {{for developing a}} targeted grazing program is patience and commitment. However, understanding livestock and plant responses to grazing are critical in developing a targeted grazing program. The program should have a clear statement {{of the kind of}} animal, timing and rate of grazing necessary to suppress troublesome plants and maintain a healthy landscape. The grazing application should 1) cause significant damage to the target plants 2) limit damage to desired vegetation and 3) be integrated with other control strategies. First, to cause significant damage to targeted plants requires understanding when the target plant is most susceptible to grazing damage and when they are most palatable to livestock. Target plant palatability depends on the grazing animals inherited and developed plant preferences (i.e. the shape of sheep and goat’s mouths make them well suited for eating broad leaf weeds). Goats are also well designed for eating shrubs. Second, target plants often exist in a plant community with many desirable plants. The challenge is to select the correct animal, grazing time and grazing intensity to maximize the impact on the target plant while reducing it on the associated plant community. Finally, management objectives, target plant species, weather, topography, plant physiology, and associated plant communities are among the many variables that can determine <b>treatment</b> <b>type</b> and duration. Well-developed targeted grazing objectives and an adaptive management plan that takes into account other control strategies need to be in place.|$|E
