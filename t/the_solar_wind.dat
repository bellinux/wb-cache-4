5|$|At about 75 Jupiter radii {{from the}} planet, the {{interaction}} of the magnetosphere with <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath—a region between it and the bow shock. <b>The</b> <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|E
5|$|Interplanetary space {{contains}} {{the magnetic field}} generated by the Sun. There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own magnetic fields. These are shaped by the influence of <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> and other sources, creating belts of magnetic particles such as the Van Allen radiation belt.

5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} prevents <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>wind,</b> {{a stream of}} ionized particles emitted by the Sun, from interacting directly with its atmosphere, and instead diverts {{it away from the}} planet, effectively creating a cavity in <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> flow, called a magnetosphere, composed of a plasma different from that of <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>wind.</b> The Jovian (i.e. pertaining to Jupiter) magnetosphere is so large that the Sun and its visible corona would fit inside it with room to spare.

40|$|Abstract. For some coronal mass ejections (CMEs), their {{interaction}} with <b>the</b> ambient <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> {{can produce a}} forward-reverse shock pair.

The front of <b>the</b> compressed <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> plasma also propagates in the forward direction relative to <b>the</b> ambient <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> and it may steepen to form a forward shock. The forward-reverse shock pair associated with CMEs moves outward in interplanetary space and evolves into a pair of fast shocks.

The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere.

5|$|The weak {{magnetosphere}} around Venus {{means that}} <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> is interacting directly with its outer atmosphere. Here, ions of {{hydrogen and oxygen}} are being created by the dissociation of neutral molecules from ultraviolet radiation. <b>The</b> <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to escape Venus's gravity field. This erosion process results in a steady loss of low-mass hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions, whereas higher-mass molecules, such as carbon dioxide, {{are more likely to}} be retained. Atmospheric erosion by <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> probably led to the loss of most of Venus's water during the first billion years after it formed. The erosion has increased the ratio of higher-mass deuterium to lower-mass hydrogen in the atmosphere 100 times compared to the rest of the solar system.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Earth, Venus lacks a {{magnetic}} field. Its ionosphere separates the atmosphere {{from outer space}} and <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>wind.</b> This ionised layer excludes the solar magnetic field, giving Venus a distinct magnetic environment.

40|$|The average {{geomagnetic}} activity during sunspot minimum has been continuously decreasing {{in the last}} four cycles.

We show that the geomagnetic activity in cycle minimum does not depend on the number and parameters of coronal mass ejections or high speed <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> streams, but on <b>the</b> background <b>solar</b> <b>wind.</b> <b>The</b> background <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> has two components: slower and faster. The source of the slower component is the heliospheric current sheet, and of the faster one the polar coronal holes.

40|$|Many jets are {{detected}} at X-ray wavelengths in the Sun's polar regions, and the ejected plasma {{along the}} jets {{has been suggested}} to contribute mass to <b>the</b> fast <b>solar</b> <b>wind.</b> From in-situ measurements in the magnetosphere, {{it has been found}} that <b>the</b> fast <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> has photospheric abundances while <b>the</b> slow <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> has coronal abundances.

We calculated the First Ionization Potential (FIP) bias factor from the ratio of the intensity between high (S) and low (Si, Fe) FIP elements using the EIS spectra. The values of the FIP bias factors for the polar jets are around 0. 7 - 1. 9, and 75 % of the values are in the range of 0. 7 - 1. 5, which indicates that they have photospheric abundances similar to <b>the</b> fast <b>solar</b> <b>wind.</b> <b>The</b> results are consistent with the reconnection jet model where photospheric plasma emerges and is rapidly ejected into the fast wind.

5|$|As with Earth's magnetosphere, the {{boundary}} separating the denser and colder solar wind's plasma from the hotter and less dense one within Jupiter's magnetosphere {{is called the}} magnetopause. The distance from the magnetopause {{to the center of}} the planet is from 45 to 100 RJ (where RJ=71,492km is the radius of Jupiter) at the subsolar point—the unfixed point on the surface at which the Sun would appear directly overhead to an observer.
