2500|$|Soros was 13 {{years old}} in March 1944 when Nazi Germany {{occupied}} Hungary. Jewish children were barred from attending school by the Nazis, and Soros and the other schoolchildren were made {{to report to the}} Judenrat ("Jewish Council") which had been established during the occupation. Soros later described this time to writer Michael Lewis: [...] "The Jewish Council asked <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>kids</b> to hand out the deportation notices. I was told to go to the Jewish Council. And there I was given these small slips of paper.... I took this piece of paper to my father. He instantly recognized it.

50|$|The {{structure}} of this tale makes it suitable for personalization and {{adaptation to the}} particular children hearing it. It's also useful in order to teach <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>kids</b> about the animals and their different sounds, or to make them participate doing the sounds. Finally, some sense of danger can be taught to the audience {{in the first part}} of the tale, by mentioning objects that can harm them or things they shouldn't play with.|$|E

5000|$|OPtion Magazine - The title says it all—gloomy, {{overdone}} Halloween music. Moanings through delays, delayed guitars, morbid lyrics, spooky synthesizer, {{and drum}} machine. I think it's great, {{in the same}} kind of way as a Herschell Gordon Lewis film. I'm not sure how much of the cheesiness is tongue-in-cheek, although I suspect quite a bit of it is, but either way there are some great sounds here, and it's thoroughly enjoyable to listen to. Come Halloween I'm gonna play this out my window, watch <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>kids</b> run, and save myself some money on candy. -- Scott Lewis.|$|E
5000|$|Sri. Ramana {{was first}} {{working for the}} [...] "Daily" [...] section of the {{newspaper}} and then shifted to [...] "Weekly" [...] section. While working here, his stories for children {{in the name of}} 'Budugu' (lil kid) were published and became very popular. He authored these stories to present the views of <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>kids</b> off their elders in the family. These stories are humorous, informative, knowledgeable to children {{and at the same time}} helping the elderly to know the thought process of their kids. Later, these stories were published in the form of a book, which was well received.|$|E

His determination to emulate elder peers despite adult warnings (swimming, helping Wilby, even switch-hitting) frequently gets him in trouble, but Moochie's bravado always returns soon afterward. Film writer Donald Liebenson has called Corcoran's character [...] "part All-American boy and part hellion." ...|$|R

5000|$|I {{was reading}} it and I was like: [...] "Holy s-t! F-k, I’m dead!" [...] … It's amazing what R. R. Martin sets up.

All <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>kids</b> and even the smallest of characters just grow and grow and grow. He built a beautiful world. I'm bummed I'm not going back. To play Khal Drogo was phenomenal and I wished there was more stuff he could have done, I'm going to miss that character.|$|E

Undaunted, Spanky {{discards}} the disguise and begins attempting to light the firecrackers with his magnifying glass. Buckwheat gets even with him by sneaking into the classroom and ringing the teacher's bell, bringing recess to an early end. As everyone heads inside, Spanky has Alfalfa stuff the firecrackers in his back pocket, and Porky picks up Spanky's magnifying glass, which he'd left discarded {{on the ground as}} he headed back inside.|$|E

[...] "Goldy" [...] Gopher (the first name seems to have appeared sometime in the 1970s) became a fixture within the University of Minnesota Marching Band and Pep Band, as each year a band member was chosen to don the suit for that season. Wherever these two bands performed, Goldy was there to glad-hand with the crowd, hug <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>kids,</b> torment the cheerleaders and generally add a friendly Minnesota flavor to the event.|$|E

40|$|Temperamental {{inhibition}} {{has been}} identified as a key risk factor for childhood anxiety and internalizing problems. An efficacious early prevention programme for shy/inhibited children has been developed; however, accurate, efficient and acceptable screening is needed to support wider implementation. We explore community screening options {{in the context of a}} trial implementing <b>the</b> Cool <b>Little</b> <b>Kids</b> prevention programme for anxiety disorders. In comparison to the Australian Temperament Project's inhibition scale, we examine the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire's (SDQ) ability to screen for inhibited preschool children. Parents of 6307 children aged 3 to 6 years enrolled in preschool programmes from eight socio-economically diverse districts in Melbourne, Australia, first completed the measures of inhibition and SDQ. Parents with inhibited children then enrolled in <b>the</b> Cool <b>Little</b> <b>Kids</b> randomized trial (n= 545). Of these, 88 % provided feedback about inhibition screening. Parents allocated to the intervention also provided feedback on <b>the</b> Cool <b>Little</b> <b>Kids</b> parenting programme. Results demonstrated that parents of preschool children (i) find inhibition screening acceptable, (ii) take up this parenting programme and (iii) report favourable feedback. The SDQ emotional symptoms subscale demonstrated acceptable sensitivity but insufficient specificity to identify inhibited preschool children. Presenting parents with a brief, validated inhibition scale could be a low-cost option for identifying inhibited preschool children in the community to offer early anxiety prevention. 12 page(s...|$|R

In her Ultimate form they look more like large, savage versions of animals rather than toys. She also enjoys making potions and has a good knowledge of medicine and herbs. Hina originally had a bad opinion of Setsuna; however, after finding out that he lied to Shoko about his circumstances in order to not worry her, she began to realize he was a lot stronger than she gave him credit for. She also comments on how he has such a pure heart that he won't even strike back at <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>kids</b> who were bullying him for interfering with their fun with Kanna.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the fourth}} season, North was earning $3,500 an episode; but by 1962, the 11-year-old {{had begun to}} outgrow the childish antics for which the {{character}} was known. [...] This, combined with the unexpected loss of Joseph Kearns {{near the end of}} season three, had changed the dynamic of the show. [...] During his interview with Filmfax, North recalled: [...] "Between the pressures of the business and Joe's dying, I became very serious, very morbid, and very withdrawn from the world. I was the antithesis of <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> that I played on the television show." [...] By the end of the fourth season, ratings were down, and in the spring of 1963, much to the relief of its young lead star, Dennis The Menace was cancelled.|$|R
