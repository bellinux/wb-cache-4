It is also not considered hunting to pursue animals without intent to kill them, as in wildlife photography, birdwatching, or scientific research activities which involve <b>tranquilizing</b> or tagging <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> or birds. The practice of foraging or gathering materials from plants and mushrooms is also considered separate from hunting.|$|R

40|$|Like {{other areas}} <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> science, the study <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> {{behaviour}} {{is becoming increasingly}} subject to eth-ical regulation and legislation. Sensible and well-informed regulation is to be welcomed both on compas-sionate grounds and because misuse <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> is likely to compromise the science itself. However, {{it is evident that}} much of the impetus and direction in the regulation debate is coming from one particular corner <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> science: that concerned with utilitarian and commercial interests taking place in con-trolled laboratory environments. This is sustained by an overemphasis on potential medical benefits as the perceived key selling point for animal science to a hostile public. Such a bias risks potentially unfor-tunate consequences for wider aspects <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> science, and is unlikely to serve the best welfare interests <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> when viewed from their own biological perspective. I review some of the concerns that arise from this, and suggest that the study <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> behaviour has a uniquely important role to play both in the development <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> welfare science itself and in the public debate about the regulation <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> science as a whole...|$|R
