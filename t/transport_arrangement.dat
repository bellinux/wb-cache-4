In the emergency medical services (EMS) role, the cabin can accommodate a pair of stretchers while maintaining easy access across each patient from either side, a full medical suite can also be installed.|$|E
40|$|A mass {{separator}} at the INEL {{has been}} successfully coupled on-line to a source of /sup 252 /Cf fission products via a He-gas jet <b>transport</b> <b>arrangement</b> using solid aerosols of NaCl as activity carriers. Initial tests of the ISOL system on-line to an approximately 7 mu g /sup 252 /Cf source are conducted using gamma-ray spectroscopic measurements of the separated /sup 138, 139 /Cs, /sup 141, 142 /Ba and /sup 142 /La activities. The measured transport efficiencies through the system of approximately 3 % and approximately 0. 3 % for the Cs and Ba isotopes, respectively, are comparable {{with the results of}} earlier tests conducted at INEL with a hollow-cathode ion source alone coupled to the He-gas jet <b>transport</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Following these tests, a general survey of the mass-separated activities is conducted with the ISOL system on-line to an approximately 600 mu g source of /sup 252 /Cf. Gross beta - gamma activity is measured for samples collected at 73 mass positions. Gamma-ray spectra are measured with a Ge(Li) detector for 29 of the mass positions. (5 refs) ...|$|E

40|$|Local {{residents}} in tourism communities are observers {{of those who}} gaze at them. This research extends host gaze studies using an emic approach. It explores how tourists are viewed in three different settings {{in the context of}} Lhasa, Tibet. The young Tibetans viewing tourists in these three different settings have different economic and social backgrounds. They also have different degrees of exposure to tourists. The study offers baseline information on how tourists are differently understood within Tibet across nationality differences. It was demonstrated that three different groups of young Tibetans variously use ethnic origins, travel and <b>transport</b> <b>arrangement,</b> and how tourists are hosted to develop their different classifications. Tolerance towards most types of tourists is high, though it varies subtly for different groups. These core perspectives can be helpful in establishing not only how Tibetan tourism is viewed but also how it can be managed and developed in the future...|$|E

40|$|A {{flat head}} and a tape <b>transport</b> <b>arrangement</b> impart a wrap angle to the tape at the {{upstream}} corner of the head. The wrap angle, corner sharpness and tape stiffness are sufficient to cause a moving tape to form a hollow bump at the upstream corner, thereby creating a hollow into which entrained air can expand, causing a subambient pressure within and downstream of the bump. This pressure keeps the tape {{in contact with the}} head. It is created without the need for a groove or complex pressure relief slot(s). No contact pressure arises at the signal exchange site due to media wrap. The highest contact pressures are developed at a wrapped upstream corner. For a tape drive, traveling in both forward and reverse, the wrap can be at both the upstream and downstream (which is the reverse upstream) corners. Heads that are not flat can also be used, if the wrap angle relative to a main surface is sufficient and not too large. The wrapped head can also be used with rotating media, such as disks (floppy and hard) and rotating heads, such as helical wound heads for video recording. Multiple flat tape bearing surfaces can be separated by grooves and/or angles. Each flat can carry heads along one or more gap lines. Multiple adjacent narrow tracks can thus be written for extreme high track density recording...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative studies {{estimate}} that potential two way trade between India and Pakistan can be about 10 times than its rather unsatisfactory current level of $ 613 million. Moving towards realizing this trade potential is clearly {{in the interest of}} both countries and the region. In this context this study identifies areas of trade and investment co-operation between the two countries. On the basis of a survey conducted in three cities viz., Delhi, Mumbai and Amritsar the paper examines the characteristics of firms engaged in Indo- Pakistan trade. It also estimates the transaction costs of trade {{on the basis of a}} detailed examination of existing <b>transport</b> <b>arrangement</b> between the two countries and the impact of all extant non-tariff barriers. The study suggests that the most important step towards enhancing trade would be to adopt the MFN principle as the current policy inhibits trade, lacks transparency and leads to high transaction costs. The study finds that transportation links between the two countries are inadequate and suggests that new rail and road links should be opened. Transaction costs of trading between India and Pakistan are high and can be lowered by implementing some rather simple policy measures that are spelled out in the paper. The study also examines recent developments in BIMSTEC, ASEAN and in Indo-Sri Lanka and Indo-Nepal trade agreements, and draws lessons to enhance Indo-Pakistan trade.

40|$|The {{twentieth century}} has seen an {{increasing}} use of products of the nuclear industry in medical and engineering fields, scientific research and for the generation of electricity. Such uses require effective <b>transport</b> <b>arrangements</b> for the varied radioactive and fissile materials involved. Throughout its development the nuclear industry has recognized that <b>transport</b> <b>arrangements</b> must be such as to ensure safety of persons, property and the environment. Accordingly, controls have been developed by organizations involved in the various modes of transport. Prior to 1959, the various national and international controls were, in the main, based on the United States Interstate Commerce Commission regulations which essentially aimed to facilitate the movement of radioactive ores and concentrates and packages containing relatively small amounts of radionuclides for medical and industrial use. The rapid expansion of the nuclear industry then foreseen required that these early regulations be further developed so as to facilitate the safe movement of all kinds and quantities of radioactive materials...|$|R

40|$|India was {{a rather}} {{marginal}} participant in world trade {{during the early years}} after independence. Since 1980, however, the structure and orientation of Indian export trades have undergone fundamental changes. Substantial {{progress has been made in}} diversifying the export base - manufactured goods have increased and the traditional bulk sector has shrunk. Key targets for the export of manufactured goods are the European, Japanese and North American markets. However, these markets are characterized by increasingly efficient trade logistics, including containerization and multimodal <b>transport</b> <b>arrangements.</b> To enable further trade growth, India is confronted with a need to tie into the highly organized international trade logistics networks, something the country is totally unprepared to cope with in terms of demanding logistical arrangements. There is a real danger that India's trade performance will deteriorate, if no corrective measures are taken. A highly fragmented service industry, outdated regulations, heavy Government control, a constrained private sector, and largely inadequate infrastructure have curtailed efforts to improve trade logistics, including containerization and multimodal <b>transport</b> <b>arrangements</b> in India.
