5|$|In 2010, THSRC {{sponsored}} the Taiwan Choral Music Center (TCMC) {{to organize the}} “Taiwan International A Cappella Festival,” which featured performances by musical groups at THSR stations. The performances were well received by passengers, with fans even forming groups <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the musicians at various stations.|$|E
5|$|As {{the elder}} sibling, Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection, but spares no {{opportunity}} to tease him. Together, they share the simple joys of life: sitting quietly under a tree, viewing pictures in a travelling vendor's bioscope, running after the candy man who passes through the village, and watching a jatra (folk theatre) performed by a troupe of actors. Every evening they are delighted {{by the sound of}} a distant train's whistle. One day, they run away from home <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the train, only to discover Indir lying dead on their return.|$|E
5|$|Although Salinger {{tried to}} escape public {{exposure}} as much as possible, he continued to struggle with unwanted attention from both {{the media and the}} public. Readers of his work and students from nearby Dartmouth College often came to Cornish in groups, hoping <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of him. In May 1986 Salinger learned that the British writer Ian Hamilton intended to publish a biography that made extensive use of letters Salinger had written to other authors and friends. Salinger sued to stop the book's publication. The court in Salinger v. Random House ruled that Hamilton's extensive use of the letters, including quotation and paraphrasing, was not acceptable since the author's right to control publication overrode the right of fair use.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now let us depart!" [...] exclaimed Obed, endeavouring <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> furtive <b>glimpse</b> of the lead, {{which he}} fancied was {{whizzing}} at his very ear; [...] "we have maintained {{the bank in}} a gallant manner, for a sufficient length of time; quite as much military skill is to be displayed in a retreat, as in an advance." ...|$|R
5|$|By war's end, Black Hawk and {{nineteen}} {{other leaders}} of the British Band were incarcerated at Jefferson Barracks. Most of the prisoners were released in the succeeding months, but in April 1833, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, Neapope, and three others were transferred to Fort Monroe in Virginia, which was better equipped to hold prisoners. The American public was eager <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the captured Indians. Large crowds gathered in Louisville and Cincinnati to watch them pass. On April 26, the prisoners met briefly with President Jackson in Washington, D.C., before being taken to Fort Monroe. Even in prison they were treated as celebrities: they posed for portraits by artists such as Charles Bird King and John Wesley Jarvis, and a dinner was held in their honor before they left.|$|E
5|$|In Apur Panchali (the Bengali {{translation}} of , 1994), Ray {{wrote that he}} had omitted many of the novel's characters {{and that he had}} rearranged some of its sequences to make the narrative better as cinema. Changes include Indir's death, which occurs early in the novel at a village shrine in the presence of adults, while in the film Apu and Durga find her corpse in the open. The scene of Apu and Durga running <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the train is not in the novel, in which neither child sees the train, although they try. Durga's fatal fever is attributed to a monsoon downpour in the film, but is unexplained in the novel. The ending of the film—the family's departure from the village—is {{not the end of the}} novel.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules {{at the top of}} his legs, invoking a theme of emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E
60|$|Jane hesitated. She {{was tired}} and wanted to get home with her canvass cards. But the woman looked tired too {{and in need of}} sympathy; {{possibly}} also, for nature is nature, Jane hoped that if she lingered there a little, without in any way violating her promise, she might chance <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> brief <b>glimpse</b> of the man she loved.|$|R
6000|$|Geoffrey {{finished}} his meal. He {{took out a}} cigarette. ("No smoking, please!" [...] said the distressed gentlewoman.) He put the cigarette back in its case. There was a new expression in his eyes now, a tender expression. For {{the first time since}} they had met Maud seemed <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> far-off <b>glimpse</b> of the man she had loved in Wales. Butter appeared to have softened Geoffrey.|$|R
60|$|By dint of patience, {{and some}} little {{interest}} with our friend the constable, we have contrived {{to make our}} way to the Lobby, and you can just manage <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>an</b> occasional <b>glimpse</b> of the House, as the door is opened for the admission of Members. It is tolerably full already, and little groups of Members are congregated together here, discussing the interesting topics of the day.|$|R
25|$|The scene {{featuring}} Bourne {{desperately trying}} <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of Paz in the London Underground after Ross is gunned down is, according to Greengrass, {{an homage to}} the New York City Subway chase {{in one of his}} favorite films, The French Connection.|$|E
25|$|The Tarsier Trail is {{a pathway}} that meanders through the gently rolling terrain of the {{interior}} towns of Corella, Sikatuna and Loboc of Bohol. Over a distance of roughly 15 kilometers it traverses the natural habitat of the Philippine tarsier, offering numerous vantage points from which <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the Philippine tarsier in the wild and become acquainted {{with a wide variety}} of local flora and fauna.|$|E
25|$|I {{actually}} {{never met}} the Three Kings—it didn't matter how hard my little brother and I tried to keep awake at night <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the Three Royal Visitors, we would always fall asleep just before they arrived. But I do remember hearing them. I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and I remember the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Addio, Madonna," [...] said Tessa, {{almost in}} a whisper, not knowing what else it would be right to say; and in an instant the heavenly lady was gone. Tessa turned <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> last <b>glimpse,</b> but she only saw the tall gliding figure vanish round the {{projecting}} stonework. So she went on her way in wonder, longing to be once more safely housed with Monna Lisa, undesirous of carnivals for evermore.|$|R
60|$|Before breakfast I {{went out}} <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> {{momentary}} <b>glimpse</b> of the city. The street {{in which our}} hotel stands is near a large public square; in the centre is a bronze equestrian statue of Louis XIV.; and the square itself is called the Place de Louis le Grand. I wonder where this statue hid itself while the Revolution was raging in Lyons, and when the guillotine, perhaps, stood on that very spot.|$|R
60|$|A {{young man}} entered the compartment, and, after one glance at Marian, who {{turned her back}} on him impatiently, spent the {{remainder}} of the journey making furtive attempts <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> second <b>glimpse</b> of her face. Conolly looked a shade graver at his wife's failure in perfect self-control; but he by no means shared her feelings toward the intrusive passenger. Marian and he were in different humors; and he did not wish to be left alone with her.|$|R
25|$|General Broadcasting System's WGBS {{radio and}} W2XCR {{television}} aired their regular broadcasting debut in New York City on April 26, 1931, {{with a special}} demonstration set up in Aeolian Hall at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-fourth Street. Thousands waited <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the Broadway stars who appeared on the six-inch (15cm) square image, in an evening event to publicize a weekday programming schedule offering films and live entertainers during the four-hour daily broadcasts. Appearing were boxer Primo Carnera, actors Gertrude Lawrence, Louis Calhern, Frances Upton and Lionel Atwill, WHN announcer Nils Granlund, the Forman Sisters, {{and a host of}} others.|$|E
25|$|After two hours, {{the whale}} was slowly and gently lifted onto a barge by a crane near Albert Bridge. By this stage there were {{thousands}} of people watching the situation develop from the banks of the river, and the images were seen across the world. The excitement of the previous day had disappeared, and there was now serious concern that the whale would be unable to survive for much longer. As the barge rushed along the Thames towards the sea, news channels provided non-stop coverage of the journey. It reached the Thames Barrier at approximately 5:00 pm. Later, despite the darkness, it was reported that crowds were lining the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the barge.|$|E
25|$|No {{official}} {{announcement of}} the actor's death was made, only a brief obituary appeared in the Moscow newspaper Vechernyaya Moskva, and a note informing of Vysotsky's death and cancellation of the Hamlet performance was put out {{at the entrance to}} the Taganka Theatre (the story goes that not a single ticket holder took advantage of the refund offer). Despite this, by the end of the day millions had learned of Vysotsky's death. On 28 July, he lay in state at the Taganka Theatre. After a mourning ceremony involving an unauthorized mass gathering of unprecedented scale, Vysotsky was buried at the Vagankovskoye Cemetery in Moscow. The attendance at the Olympic events dropped noticeably on that day, as scores of spectators left to attend the funeral. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of his coffin.|$|E
50|$|The story {{revolves}} around Miles Garth, who {{at a dinner}} party goes upstairs, locks himself in the spare bedroom and refuses to leave indefinitely. He goes on to become a minor celebrity with crowds gathering outside <b>to</b> try and <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of him at the window; and merchandize being produced with his name.|$|R
60|$|I {{did not see}} the {{prisoner}} again for several days subsequent to our first encounter, and then only <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> fleeting <b>glimpse</b> of her as she was being conducted to the great audience chamber where I had had my first meeting with Lorquas Ptomel. I could not but note the unnecessary harshness and brutality with which her guards treated her; so different from the almost maternal kindliness which Sola manifested toward me, and the respectful attitude of the few green Martians who took the trouble to notice me at all.|$|R
60|$|Dressed all in black, {{he looked}} {{distinctly}} {{older than the}} crowd had remembrance of him. A sigh of excited anticipation went all along the line, a regular bousculade ensued; the people behind trying <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> nearer <b>glimpse</b> of the Duke and pushing those who were in front. The 'prentices, who were squatting in the foremost rank on the ground, were violently jerked forward, some fell on their faces right up against the Lieutenant and my lord Rich, seeing which and the general excited confusion the Duke was observed to smile.|$|R
25|$|Wildcat fans packed Rupp Arena for Big Blue Madness (the first {{practice}} {{of the season and}} the program's major publicity event) <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of their new coach in action. In his first few months he signed two high-profile recruits, Patrick Patterson and Alex Legion. Patterson had previously been recruited by the Duke Blue Devils, Florida Gators, and Kentucky Wildcats (by former coach Tubby Smith) before signing with Gillispie. Alex Legion would transfer 6 games into his first season at Kentucky. Gillispie's first season got off to a rocky start, being routed 84–68 by unranked Gardner Webb in Rupp Arena in the second game of the season. This loss dropped the Wildcats from the AP Top 25 poll, where they did not return {{for the remainder of the}} season. The Wildcats improved their record during conference play, achieving a 12–4 record and on March 11, Gillispie was named Co-Southeastern Conference coach of the year along with Bruce Pearl of the Tennessee Volunteers.|$|E
25|$|In January 2002, {{a man was}} {{attacked}} by a Siberian tiger on a remote mountain road near Hunchun in Jilin Province, China, near the borders of Russia and North Korea. He suffered compound fractures but managed to survive. When he sought medical attention, his story raised suspicions as Siberian tigers seldom attack humans. An investigation of the attack scene revealed that raw venison carried by the man was left untouched by the tiger. Officials suspected the man to be a poacher who provoked the attack. The following morning, tiger sightings were reported by locals along the same road, and a local TV station did an on-site coverage. The group found tiger tracks and blood spoor in the snow at the attack scene and followed them for approximately 2,500 meters, hoping <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the animal. Soon, the tiger was seen ambling slowly ahead of them. As the team tried to get closer for a better camera view, the tiger suddenly turned and charged, causing the four to flee in panic. About an hour after that encounter, the tiger attacked and killed a 26-year-old woman on the same road. Authorities retrieved the body {{with the help of}} a bulldozer. By then, the tiger was found lying 20 meters away, weak and barely alive. It was successfully tranquilized and taken for examination, which revealed that the tiger was anemic and gravely injured by a poacher’s snare around its neck, with the steel wire cutting deeply down to the vertebrae, severing both trachea and esophagus. Despite extensive surgery by a team of veterinarians, the tiger died of wound infection. Subsequent investigation of the first attack revealed that the first victim was a poacher who set multiple snares that caught both the tiger and a deer. The man was later charged for poaching and harming endangered species. He served two years in prison. After being released from prison, he worked in clearing the forest of old snares.|$|E
500|$|Rosaline ( [...] or [...] ) is {{an unseen}} {{character}} and niece of Capulet in William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet (1597). Although silent, her role is important. Romeo is at first deeply {{in love with}} Rosaline and expresses his dismay at her not loving him back. Romeo first spots Juliet while trying <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of Rosaline at a gathering hosted by the Capulet family.|$|E
60|$|Walking to the taffrail, I was {{in time to}} make out, on {{the very}} edge of a {{darkness}} thrown by a towering black mass like the very gateway of Erebus--yes, I was in time <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>an</b> evanescent <b>glimpse</b> of my white hat left behind to mark the spot where the secret sharer of my cabin and of my thoughts, as though he were my second self, had lowered himself into the water to take his punishment: a free man, a proud swimmer striking out for a new destiny.|$|R
50|$|After {{this history}} {{of success and}} deaths the Whaley House remains well known as a haunted house. It is said that guests and the staff, from time <b>to</b> time, will <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of {{the ghost of a}} Whaley family member who died inside the house such as: baby Thomas Jr., Violet, Anna, Francis, George or Corinne Lillian Whaley.|$|R
60|$|The Indians {{departed}} their {{several ways}} without reply, while Hawkeye cautiously proceeded {{with the two}} gentlemen. Heyward soon pressed {{to the side of}} their guide, eager <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>an</b> early <b>glimpse</b> of those enemies he had pursued with so much toil and anxiety. His companion told him to steal {{to the edge of the}} wood, which, as usual, was fringed with a thicket, and wait his coming, for he wished to examine certain suspicious signs a little on one side. Duncan obeyed, and soon found himself in a situation to command a view which he found as extraordinary as it was novel.|$|R
500|$|Crowds {{reportedly}} mobbed Tothill Fields Bridewell for months, hoping <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> {{of the now}} infamous Toft. [...] By {{this time}} she had become quite ill, and while incarcerated had her portrait drawn by John Laguerre. [...] She was ultimately discharged on 8April 1727, as it was unclear as to what charge should have been made against her. [...] The Toft family made no profit from the affair, and Mary Toft returned to Surrey. [...] In February 1728 (recorded as 1727 Old Style), {{she gave birth to}} a daughter, Elizabeth, noted in the Godalming parish register as her [...] "first child after her pretended Rabett-breeding." [...] Little is known of Toft's later life. She briefly reappeared in 1740 when she was imprisoned for receiving stolen goods. She died in 1763, and her obituary ran in London newspapers alongside those of aristocrats.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial on}} the Toa Payoh ritual murders was closely {{followed}} by the populace of Singapore. [...] Throngs of people constantly packed {{the grounds of the}} courts, hoping <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of Adrian Lim and to hear the revelations first-hand. [...] Reported by regional newspapers in detail, the gory and sexually explicit recounting of Lim's acts offended the sensibilities of some; Canon Frank Lomax, Vicar of St. Andrew's Anglican Church, complained to The Straits Times that the reports could have a corrupting effect on the young. [...] His words received support from a few readers. [...] Others, however, welcomed the open reporting, considering it helpful in raising public awareness of the need for vigilance even in a city with low crime rates. [...] Books, which covered the murders and the trial, were quickly bought by the public on their release.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the wood}} and timber {{that made up the}} fort was {{undoubtedly}} burned by squatters or scavenged for building materials in the first few years after the war, the fort's embankments and trenches lasted quite a bit longer. A 1901 Rand McNally tour guide of Washington instructs tourists to look out of the windows of their train {{at the south end of}} the Long Bridge <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the decaying fort. [...] "At its further end there still stands, plainly seen at the left of the track as soon as the first high ground is reached, Fort Runyon, a strong earthwork erected in 1861 to guard the head of the bridge from raiders." [...] A brickworks was also located nearby, sometimes utilizing the clay that formed the bastions of Fort Runyon as raw material for the bricks that would later go into the walls of Washington homes.|$|E
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH: [...] "I {{always did}} justice to your good-heartedness, Allen; you're {{perfectly}} lovely that way; and I {{know that you}} would be sorry if you knew you had wounded my feelings, however accidentally." [...] She droops her head so as <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> sidelong <b>glimpse</b> of his face, and sighs, while she nervously pinches the top of her parasol, resting the point on the floor. Mr. Richards makes no answer. [...] "That about the cigar-case might have been a mistake; I saw that myself, and, as you explain it, why, it was certainly very kind and very creditable to--to your thoughtfulness. It WAS thoughtful!" ...|$|R
6000|$|No {{sooner had}} the text been spoken, [...] "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God," [...] than she seemed <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> {{fleeting}} <b>glimpse</b> of <b>an</b> hitherto unimagined Personality. Hundreds of times {{she had heard}} those words, {{and they had been}} as meaningless to her as to Nicodemus. But now--now something was brought home to her of the magnificent certainty with which they must first have been spoken, of the tone and bearing and authority of him who had uttered them. Was Christ like that? And could it be a Truth, after all, a truth only to be grasped by one who had experienced it? ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{the driver}} chirruped to his horses and swung {{out into the}} street, Marshall Haney, with full {{understanding}} that {{this was to be}} his eternal farewell, turned and looked up, hoping <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>a</b> last <b>glimpse</b> of his wife's sweet face at the window. A sign, a smile, a beckoning, and his purpose might still have faltered, but the recall did not take place, and facing the west he became again the man of will. When the carriage drew up to the platform he gave orders to his coachman as quietly as though this were his usual morning ride. [...] "Now, Oscar, you heard what that friend of mine said?" ...|$|R
