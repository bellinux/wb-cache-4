The statistics were much different among Māori, with 40% of Māori saying the police had over-reacted. The sample size was 750 people.|$|E
500|$|Gilly later {{finds himself}} {{attracted}} to Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan); he initially fears he is {{moving on to}} soon. Whilst interviewed by Inside Soap Quinlan describes the scenes in which they share their first kiss stating: [...] "Gilly gets a new job at Look Sharpe as a personal trainer, and invites Lynsey for a free session, Lynsey's looking pretty good when she turns up, so Gilly gets a bit sweaty and hot under the collar - and she ends up hopping into the tub and dragging Gilly in fully clothed!" [...] They later meet up and feel awkward because of Gilly's grief for Steph, of this Quinlan adds: [...] "They're getting on well, {{but as soon as}} the word date is mentioned, it goes a bit wrong, nerves get the better of them and they have a huge row." [...] Off-screen Quinlan was not happy with the fact Gilly is trying to move on quick, of this he states: [...] "I thought it was a bit harsh, it feels like it's a little too soon, doesn't it? We'll just have <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the future holds for Gilly and Lynsey - but there's no comparison to Steph..." ...|$|E
500|$|Ferdinand's actions {{constituted}} a definitive de facto break {{both with the}} autonomous governments, which had not yet declared formal independence, and with the effort of Spanish liberals to create a representative government that would fully include the overseas possessions. Such a government {{was seen as an}} alternative to independence by many in New Spain, Central America, the Caribbean, Quito, Peru, Upper Peru and Chile. Yet the news of the restoration of the [...] "ancien régime" [...] did not initiate a new wave of juntas, as had happened in 1809 and 1810, with the notable exception of the establishment of a junta in Cuzco demanding the implementation of the Spanish Constitution. Instead most Spanish Americans were moderates who decided <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> would come out of the restoration of normalcy. In fact, in areas of New Spain, Central America and Quito, governors found it expedient to leave the elected constitutional ayuntamientos in place for several years in order to prevent conflict with the local society. Liberals {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, nevertheless, continued to conspire to bring back a constitutional monarchy, ultimately succeeding in 1820. The most dramatic example of transatlantic collaboration is perhaps Francisco Javier Mina's expedition to Texas and northern Mexico in 1816 and 1817.|$|E

2500|$|His mother was, in many ways, {{instrumental}} {{in his ability}} to pursue art as a vocation. When he was 11 years of age, she had noted in her diary: [...] "The child's character is still so unformed that I cannot say what I think of it. He behaves like a spoiled child, but he does not lack intelligence. We shall have <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> is inside this chrysalis. Perhaps an artist?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Hornby {{was heavily}} involved, {{providing}} {{the track and}} the prototype of their OO gauge British Rail Class 395 Javelin train. Simon Kohler, marketing manager of Hornby model railways, said that the train which travels at just [...] failed two miles short of Bideford station; but he also told BBC News [...] "Even though the last locomotive gave up the ghost at Instow, we did link the track [...] in fact I finished it at about 2230 [...] so we'll just need <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> Guinness make of it.|$|E
2500|$|On July 31, {{just hours}} {{prior to the}} {{announcement}} of Castro's condition, U.S. President George W. Bush told WAQI-AM, a Spanish-language radio station in Miami, [...] "If Fidel Castro were to move on because of natural causes, we've got a plan in place {{to help the people}} of Cuba understand there's a better way than the system in which they've been living under. No one knows when Fidel Castro will move on. In my judgment, that's the work of the Almighty." [...] On August 2, Senator Robert Bennett (R-Utah) said President Bush told him the administration was surprised by the announcement of Castro's illness, [...] "The president's comment was that everybody was caught by surprise, and we'll have <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> U.S. action is necessary. I think all of us can say we had no idea this was coming." ...|$|E
2500|$|... (yōsu) means {{situation}} {{or the state}} of things, and [...] (miru) is [...] "to see", thus [...] "yōsu o miru", to [...] "see how things stand". In Japanese this expression is usually {{used to say that}} it's better <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> before taking an action (e.g. [...] "shibaraku yōsu o miru beki da", it's better <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> for a little while). It is not a single word or a set phrase except in Western Go literature, and [...] "probe" [...] is the preferred word, being self-explanatory and actually used by the speakers of its originating language.|$|R

2500|$|Irvine {{remained}} at Jaguar for 2002 and was again partnered by de la Rosa. In {{preparation for the}} upcoming season, Irvine undertook a fitness examination and recorded a high score. However, he was cautious about his team's prospects going into the year, saying: [...] "We've just got <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens with this car, that's the question mark". At the opening round in Australia, Irvine finished fourth; and in the following race in Malaysia, {{he was forced to}} retire with an hydraulics problem. Irvine later managed to clinch seventh place in the Brazilian Grand Prix, before he suffered consecutive retirements in the next three races. He later finished the Monaco Grand Prix in ninth position, which was followed up with further consecutive retirements in the seven races. However, this marked a turning point as Irvine managed to finish in all of the remaining races. He was in the points scoring positions twice in this period—a sixth-place finish in Belgium and took his final career podium with third in Italy. He finished the season ninth in the Drivers' Championship, with eight points.|$|E

60|$|With Pompeius fell {{the hopes}} {{of those who were}} {{faithful}} to the old government, such as Cicero and Cato. They had only <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> Cæsar would do, and with the memory of Marius in their minds.|$|E

40|$|Ascending auctions offer agents {{the option}} <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> before {{deciding}} <b>to</b> drop out. We {{show that in}} contexts where as time proceeds agents get finer and finer estimates of their valuations, incentives to drop out at one’s expected valuation are weak: it is optimal for agents <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see.</b> We first illustrate the claim in a private value setting. We next analyze an interdependent value setting in which this <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> option results in an imperfect information aggregation. We also analyze the implications for the seller’s revenue, and show that the ascending format may dominate the second-price format, independently of the date at which the second price auction is run.

60|$|Sir Giles Musgrave of Peelholm {{was an old}} campaigner, {{and when}} Hal came out beyond {{the gate of the}} Threlkeld fortalice, he found him {{reviewing}} his troop; a very disorderly collection, as Sir Lancelot pronounced with a sneer, looking out on them, and strongly advising his step-son not to cast in his lot with them, but <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> would befall, and whether the Nevils were in earnest in their desertion of the House of York.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} they reached the Pig's dwelling, which stood in a thick wood, it was quite dark. They sat down quietly for a little, as they were tired after their drive; then they had supper together, and lay down to rest.

She was not a little surprised, but remembering her father's words, she took courage, {{determined}} <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> would happen.|$|E
60|$|He {{knew not}} what to do. It seemed absurd now {{to go to}} her father next morning, as he had purposed, and ask for an {{engagement}} with her, a possibility impending all the while that Elfride herself would not be on his side. Only one course recommended itself as wise. <b>To</b> <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the days would bring forth; to go and execute his commissions in Birmingham; then to return, learn if anything had happened, and try what a meeting might do; perhaps her surprise at his backwardness would bring her forward to show latent warmth as decidedly as in old times.|$|E
