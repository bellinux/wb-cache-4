5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> advertised {{across the}} U.S. against Democratic candidates, {{including}} Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the Iraq War, and {{accused him of}} failing {{to stimulate the economy}} and job growth. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq, and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.|$|E

She did say, however, {{that she had never}} dreamed that he would run for office. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> worked to assure voters that as First Lady, she would not seek to emulate then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. When asked who she would be like out of the past First Ladies, she insisted it would be herself.|$|E

25|$|Governor Dukakis {{attempted}} to quell criticism {{that he was}} ignorant on military matters by staging a photo op in which he rode in an M1 Abrams tank outside a General Dynamics plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan. The move ended up being regarded as a major public relations blunder, with many mocking Dukakis's appearance as he waved to the crowd from the tank. Footage of Dukakis was used by <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> as evidence he would not make a good commander-in-chief, and the incident remains a commonly cited example of backfired public relations outings.|$|E

25|$|On February 1, McCain won a 49–30% {{victory over}} Bush in the New Hampshire primary. Gary Bauer dropped out. After coming in third in Delaware Forbes dropped out, leaving three candidates. In the South Carolina primary, Bush soundly {{defeated}} McCain. Some McCain supporters {{blamed it on}} <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign,</b> accusing them of mudslinging and dirty tricks, such as push polling that implied that McCain's adopted Bangladeshi-born daughter was an African-American child he fathered out of wedlock. While McCain's loss in South Carolina damaged his campaign, he won both Michigan and {{his home state of}} Arizona on February 22. The primary election that year also affected the South Carolina State House, when a controversy about the Confederate flag flying over the capitol dome prompted the state legislature to move the flag to a less prominent position at a Civil War memorial on the capitol grounds. Most GOP candidates said the issue should be left to South Carolina voters, though McCain later recanted and said the flag should be removed.|$|E
500|$|On February 1, 2000, McCain won {{the primary}} with 49percent {{of the vote}} to Bush's 30percent, and {{suddenly}} was the celebrity of the hour. Other Republican candidates had dropped out or failed to gain traction, and McCain became Bush's only serious opponent. Analysts predicted that a McCain victory in the crucial South Carolina primary might give his insurgency campaign unstoppable momentum; a degree of fear and panic crept into not only <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> but also the Republican establishment and movement conservatism. [...] Bush's top campaign staff met and strategized {{what to do about}} McCain; one advisor said, [...] "We gotta hit him hard." ...|$|E
500|$|Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush {{of lying}} and {{comparing}} {{the governor to}} Bill Clinton, which Bush said was [...] "about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary". An anonymous smear campaign began against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, and audience plants. The smears claimed that McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter was adopted from Bangladesh), that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, {{that he was a}} homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] who was either a traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> strongly denied any involvement with the attacks.|$|E

He subsequently served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for trade development and commerce for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, serving from 1990 to 1991. In June 1992, Bush appointed Huntsman to become U.S. Ambassador to Singapore, which he was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate in August.

500|$|After easily {{winning the}} Republican primary, Bush faced popular Democratic {{incumbent}} Governor Ann Richards. In {{the course of}} the campaign, Bush pledged to sign a bill allowing Texans to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons. Richards had vetoed the bill, but Bush signed it into law after he became governor. According to The Atlantic Monthly, the race [...] "featured a rumor that she was a lesbian, along with a rare instance of such a tactic's making it into the public record – when a regional chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> allowed himself, perhaps inadvertently, to be quoted criticizing Richards for 'appointing avowed homosexual activists' to state jobs". The Atlantic, and others, connected the lesbian rumor to Karl Rove, but Rove denied being involved. Bush won the general election with 53.5percent against Richards' 45.9percent.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{focused on}} the New Hampshire primary, where his message appealed to independents. He {{traveled}} on a campaign bus called the Straight Talk Express. He held many town hall meetings, answering every question voters asked, in a successful example of [...] "retail politics", and he used free media to compensate for his lack of funds. One reporter later recounted that, [...] "McCain talked all day long with reporters on his Straight Talk Express bus; he talked so much that sometimes he said things that he shouldn't have, and that's why the media loved him." [...] On February 1, 2000, he won New Hampshire's primary with 49percent of the vote to Bush's 30percent. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> and the Republican establishment feared that a McCain victory in the crucial South Carolina primary might give his campaign unstoppable momentum.|$|E

500|$|Pat Buchanan {{eventually}} won the Reform Party {{presidential nomination}} at a chaotic National Convention in Long Beach in August 2000. [...] Buchanan {{had lost the}} support of the Perot faction, which accused Buchanan of fraud and held a counter-convention, nominating Buchanan's only major opponent physicist John Hagelin of the Natural Law Party. [...] According to Russ Verney, the Perot faction lost faith in Buchanan when he emphasized pro-life and anti-homosexual issue positions after promising to respect the party's neutral stance on social issues. [...] After the filing of a complaint over the party's matching funds, the FEC ruled against the Perot faction and invalided the Hagelin selection. [...] The decision was affirmed on appeal. On Election Day, Buchanan appeared on the ballot in all 50 states and received 448,895 votes, 0.42% of the popular vote. [...] George W.

500|$|The {{day that}} a new poll showed McCain five points ahead in the state, Bush allied himself on stage with a {{marginal}} and controversial veterans activist named J.

[...] Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton, which Bush complained was [...] "about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary and many Republicans thought comparing Bush's truthfulness to Bill Clinton's dishonesty was distasteful smear by McCain." [...] An unidentified party began a semi-underground smear campaign against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, audience plants, and the like. [...] These claimed most famously that he had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter Bridget was adopted from Bangladesh; this misrepresentation {{was thought to be}} an especially effective slur in a Deep South state where race was still central), but also that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> strongly denied any involvement with these attacks; Bush said he would fire anyone who ran defamatory push polls.
