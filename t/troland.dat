500|$|In 1900, the German {{physicist}} Max Planck {{was studying}} black-body radiation {{and suggested that}} the energy carried by electromagnetic waves could only be released in [...] "packets" [...] of energy. In his 1901 article [...] in Annalen der Physik he called these packets [...] "energy elements". The word quanta (singular quantum, Latin for [...] ) was used before 1900 to mean particles or amounts of different quantities, including electricity. In 1905, Albert Einstein suggested that electromagnetic waves could only exist as discrete wave-packets. He called such a wave-packet the light quantum (German: das Lichtquant). The name photon derives from the Greek word for light, [...] (transliterated phôs). Arthur Compton used photon in 1928, referring to Gilbert N. Lewis. The same name was used earlier, by the American physicist and psychologist Leonard T. <b>Troland,</b> who coined the word in 1916, in 1921 by the Irish physicist John Joly, in 1924 by the French physiologist René Wurmser (1890-1993) and in 1926 by the French physicist Frithiof Wolfers (1891-1971). The name was suggested initially as a unit related to the illumination of the eye and the resulting sensation of light and was used later in a physiological context. Although Wolfers's and Lewis's theories were contradicted by many experiments and never accepted, the new name was adopted very soon by most physicists after Compton used it.|$|E

40|$|Reaction {{times for}} {{incremental}} and decremental stimuli were measured at five suprathreshold contrasts for six retinal illuminance levels where rods alone (0. 002 – 0. 2 <b>Trolands),</b> rods and cones (2 – 20 <b>Trolands)</b> or cones alone (200 <b>Trolands)</b> mediated detection. A 4 -primary photostimulator allowed independent control of rod or cone excitations. This {{is the first}} report of reaction times to isolated rod or cone stimuli at mesopic light levels under the same adaptation conditions. The main findings are: (1) For rods, responses to decrements were faster than increments, but cone reaction times were closely similar. (2) At light levels where both systems were functional, rod reaction times were 20 ms longer. The data were fitted with a computational model that incorporates rod and cone impulse response functions and a stimulus-dependent neural sensory component that triggers a motor response. Rod and cone impulse response functions were derived from published psychophysical two-pulse threshold data and temporal modulation transfer functions. The model fits were accomplished with {{a limited number of}} free parameters: two global parameters to estimate the irreducible minimum reaction time for each receptor type, and one local parameter for each reaction time versus contrast function. This is the first model to provide a neural basis for the variation in reaction time with retinal illuminance, stimulus contrast, stimulus polarity, and receptor class modulated...|$|R

The phase angles are approximately additive. An analysis is given in terms of more basic phase shifts between the red and green systems according to the Young-Helmholtz theory.

40|$|We {{recorded}} the a-wave of the electroretinogram from human subjects with normal vision, using a corneal fibre electrode and ganzfeld stimulation under photopic conditions, {{so as to}} extract the parameters of cone phototransduction. The amplitude of bright flash responses provided {{a measure of the}} massed circulating current of the cones, while the amplitude of dim flash responses provided a measure of the product of the fraction of cone photopigment present, and the amplification constant of transduction within the cones. In the presence of steady background illumination, the cone circulating current declined to half at 3000 photopic <b>trolands,</b> and to a quarter at 20 000 photopic <b>trolands.</b> At very early times after the delivery of a near-total bleach, we could not determine the level of circulating current as our bright flashes did not appear to saturate the a-wave (presumably because so little pigment was present). However, by 20 – 30 s after a total bleach, the cone circulating current had returned to its dark-adapted level. Following smaller bleaches (when ca 50 % of the pigment remained present) the bright flashes were able to saturate the a-wave even at very early times. Within 3 s of extinction of the illumination, the cone circulating current had returned to its dark-adapted level. This is at least a factor of 300 times faster than the period of ca 15 min required for full recovery of rods exposed to the same level of bleach, and indicates a major difference between rods and cones {{in the way that they}} cope with the photoproducts of bleaching. Despite the very rapid recovery of circulating current after bleaches, the recovery of dim-flash sensitivity was much slower, with a time constant of ca 1. 5 min after a near-total bleach. This time course is very similar to previous measurements of the regeneration of cone photopigment, and it seems highly probable that the reduction in dim-flash sensitivity results from pigment depletion...|$|R

Above about 10 Hz, the relationship between fusion-frequency v and saturation degree S can be expressed as log S = C + m log v. The slope m for the several wavelengths turned out to be different.

The number of required R-C-elements for the several wavelengths is also different...|$|R
40|$|The human cone {{visual system}} {{maintains}} contrast sensitivity {{over a wide}} range of ambient illumination, a property known as light adaptation. The first stage in light adaptation is believed to take place at the first neural step in vision, within the long, middle, and short wavelength sensitive cone photoreceptors. To determine the properties of adaptation in primate outer retina, we measured cone signals in second-order interneurons, the horizontal cells, of the macaque monkey. Horizontal cells provide a unique site for studying early adaptational mechanisms; they are but one synapse away from the photoreceptors, and each horizontal cell receives excitatory inputs from many cones. Light adaptation occurred over the entire range of light levels evaluated, a luminance range of 15 – 1, 850 <b>trolands.</b> Adaptation was demonstrated to be independent in each cone type and to be spatially restricted. Thus, in primates, a major source of sensitivity regulation occurs before summation of cone signals in the horizontal cell...|$|R
