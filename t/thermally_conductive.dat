30|$|As {{was already}} shown by Przybycin et al. (2015 b), the long {{wavelength}} thermal {{field of the}} Molasse Basin is dominated by conductive heat transport {{which in turn is}} mostly influenced by the structural configuration of the crust and the lithosphere beneath the basin and lateral heterogeneities in the thermal conductivity. Thereby, the depth of the thermal lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary (LAB =  1300  °C isotherm) has a distinct effect on the long wavelength thermal field by creating the principal thermal gradient. A second effect is caused by the upper crystalline crust, which is characterized by a much higher radiogenic heat production than the sediments or the deeper crust and the mantle. In addition, sensitivity analyses of thermal properties have shown that the structure and the high thermal conductivity of the crystalline core of the Tauern Window cause a chimney effect between the <b>thermally</b> more <b>conductive</b> Tauern Body and the <b>thermally</b> less <b>conductive</b> Alpine Body. Moreover, a blanketing effect is caused by the <b>thermally</b> less <b>conductive</b> Molasse Sediments covering the <b>thermally</b> more <b>conductive</b> crystalline crust. These effects may partly explain the positive thermal anomalies around Munich and at the eastern border of Bavaria with a negative thermal anomaly in between. However, the thermal anomalies predicted by the conductive model of Przybycin et al. (2015 b) have been too warm compared to measured data, which indicates that other than conductive effects may be relevant.|$|R

25|$|Copper {{cookware}} {{lined with}} {{a thin layer of}} stainless steel is available from most modern European manufacturers. Stainless steel is 25 times less <b>thermally</b> <b>conductive</b> than copper, and is sometimes critiqued for compromising the efficacy of the copper with which it is bonded. Among the advantages of stainless steel are its durability and corrosion resistance, and although relatively sticky and subject to food residue adhesions, stainless steel is tolerant of most abrasive cleaning techniques and metal implements. Stainless steel forms a pan's structural element when bonded to copper and is irreparable in the event of wear or damage.|$|E
25|$|As power {{dissipation}} of components increases and component package size decreases, thermal engineers must innovate to ensure components won't overheat. Devices that run cooler last longer. A heat sink design must fulfill both its thermal {{as well as}} its mechanical requirements.

The heat sink could be the copper foil of a circuit board, or a separate heat sink mounted onto the component or circuit board.

Measurements show that an individual SWNT has a room-temperature thermal conductivity along its axis of about 3500 W·m−1·K−1; compare this to copper, a metal well known for its good thermal conductivity, which transmits 385 W·m−1·K−1. An individual SWNT has a room-temperature thermal conductivity across its axis (in the radial direction) of about 1.52 W·m−1·K−1, which is about as <b>thermally</b> <b>conductive</b> as soil.

2500|$|As meteoroids are heated during {{atmospheric}} entry, their surfaces melt {{and experience}} ablation. They can be sculpted into various shapes during this process, sometimes resulting in shallow thumbprint-like indentations on their surfaces called s. If the meteoroid maintains a fixed orientation for some time, without tumbling, it may develop a conical [...] "nose cone" [...] or [...] "heat shield" [...] shape. As it decelerates, eventually the molten surface layer solidifies into a thin fusion crust, which on most meteorites is black (on some achondrites, the fusion crust {{may be very}} light colored). On stony meteorites, the heat-affected zone is at most a few mm deep; in iron meteorites, which are more <b>thermally</b> <b>conductive,</b> {{the structure of the}} metal may be affected by heat up to [...] below the surface. Reports vary; some meteorites are reported to be [...] "burning hot to the touch" [...] upon landing, while others are alleged to have been cold enough to condense water and form a frost.

2500|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{microwave ovens}} cook food [...] "from the inside out", meaning {{from the center}} of the entire mass of food outwards. This idea arises from heating behavior seen if an absorbent layer of water lies beneath a less absorbent drier layer at the surface of a food; in this case, the deposition of heat energy inside a food can exceed that on its surface. This can also occur if the inner layer has a lower heat capacity than the outer layer causing it to reach a higher temperature, or even if the inner layer is more <b>thermally</b> <b>conductive</b> than the outer layer making it feel hotter despite having a lower temperature. In most cases, however, with uniformly structured or reasonably homogenous food item, microwaves are absorbed in the outer layers of the item at a similar level to that of the inner layers. Depending on water content, the depth of initial heat deposition may be several centimetres or more with microwave ovens, in contrast to broiling/grilling (infrared) or convection heating—methods which deposit heat thinly at the food surface. Penetration depth of microwaves is dependent on food composition and the frequency, with lower microwave frequencies (longer wavelengths) penetrating further.|$|E

Furthermore the morphology was investigated. It turns out that all methods can be utilized to produce polymer micro-elements. Only the components manufactured by the ultrasonic plasticising and direct injection show significantly lower mechanical properties in comparison to the other two methods. This is due among other things ascribable to the detected lower degree of crystallinity...|$|R
2500|$|A {{complementary}} observable {{aspect of}} the first law is about heat transfer. Adynamic transfer of energy as heat can be measured empirically by changes in the surroundings {{of the system of}} interest by calorimetry. This again requires the existence of adiabatic enclosure of the entire process, system and surroundings, though the separating wall between the surroundings and the system is <b>thermally</b> <b>conductive</b> or radiatively permeable, not adiabatic. A calorimeter can rely on measurement of sensible heat, which requires the existence of thermometers and measurement of temperature change in bodies of known sensible heat capacity under specified conditions; or it can rely on the measurement of latent heat, through measurement of masses of material that change phase, at temperatures fixed by the occurrence of phase changes under specified conditions in bodies of known latent heat of phase change. The calorimeter can be calibrated by adiabatically doing externally determined work on it. The most accurate method is by passing an electric current from outside through a resistance inside the calorimeter. The calibration allows comparison of calorimetric measurement of quantity of heat transferred with quantity of energy transferred as work.
