5|$|During late 1536, Farel {{drafted a}} {{confession}} of faith, and Calvin wrote separate articles on reorganizing {{the church in}} Geneva. On 16 January 1537, Farel and Calvin presented their Articles concernant l'organisation de l'église et du culte à Genève (Articles on the Organization of the Church and its Worship at Geneva) to the city council. The document described the manner and frequency of their celebrations of the Eucharist, the reason for, and the method of, excommunication, the requirement <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> confession of faith, the use of congregational singing in the liturgy, and the revision of marriage laws. The council accepted the document on the same day.|$|E
5|$|So {{long as we}} exclude one community, {{we cannot}} as a {{political}} {{speak on behalf of}} or claim to represent all the people of our presidency. If, as we hope, provincial autonomy is given to the provinces {{as a result of the}} reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation should be in a position to claim to be a truly representative body of all communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aims and objects of our Federation? It may be that the Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. But surely our Federation will not thereafter be open to objection on the ground that it is an exclusive organisation.|$|E

25|$|HBO {{broadcasts}} {{its primary}} and multiplex channels on both Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together (though most cable providers only offer {{the east and}} west coast feeds of the main HBO channel, as well as HBO2 in some cases), resulting in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most. The premium film service Cinemax, which is also owned by Time Warner through Home Box Office Inc., operates as a separate service from HBO; although HBO is very frequently sold together in a package with Cinemax, subscribers to one of the services do not necessarily have <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other.|$|E

25|$|Roosevelt and Henry Morgenthau {{insisted that}} the Big Four (United States, United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China) {{participate}} in the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, but their goal was frustrated when the Soviet Union would not join the IMF. In the past, {{the reasons why the}} Soviet Union chose not <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> articles by December 1945 {{have been the subject of}} speculation. But since the release of relevant Soviet archives, it is now clear that the Soviet calculation was based on the behavior of the parties that had actually expressed their assent to the Bretton Woods Agreements. The extended debates about ratification that had taken place both in the UK and the U.S. were read in Moscow as evidence of the quick disintegration of the wartime alliance.|$|E
25|$|In {{the reign}} of Charles I, the leading gentry of the Puritan party were the Robarteses of Lanhydrock, the Bullers of Morval, the Boscawens of Tregothnan and the Rouses of Halton, while Puritan clergy were to be found at Blisland, Morval, Landrake, and Mylor. However, during the Civil War {{there was much more}} support in Cornwall for the Anglican and Royalist {{position}} and the military successes of the Royalist army delayed any imposition of Presbyteriansim in church administration. The Parliamentary success in 1645 led to the ejection of the Bishop of Exeter and the depriving of the cathedral chapter. In 1646 the 72 clergy regarded as unacceptable to the county committee were required <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new order. Some submitted while others were obstinate and so were deprived of their benefices. Civil marriage was instituted in 1653 but was not popular; much iconoclasm took place in churches such as the destruction of the stained glass at St Agnes and the rood screen at St Ives. The church organs at Launceston and St Ives were also destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{and policymakers}} who address {{controversial}} safety-related {{issues have been}} targets of threats or violence {{for hundreds of years}} from those with strong feelings who wish to obstruct certain knowledge for the basis of evidence-based policy. More recently, researchers and their institutions have come under attack for work in the areas of firearms and motorcycle helmets. These sorts of things are known because they {{have been the subject of}} editorials in journals and even print and broadcast news stories. However, providers of scholarly information such as SafetyLit have also been harmed by those who disagree with part of its content. Some SafetyLit readers write letters to the agencies and organizations that provide funding for the project. Others take more extreme action to make their point. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have been made against the SafetyLit servers. Other attackers organized their interest groups <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SafetyLit email service and then to label the SafetyLit messages as unsolicited spam by using their internet service providers' automated reporting process.

25|$|In September 1826, Lovejoy {{graduated}} from Waterville College with first-class honors {{at the top}} of his class. During the winter and spring, he taught at China Academy. Dissatisfied with daily teaching, Lovejoy thought about moving to the South or Western United States. His former teachers at Waterville College advised him that he would best serve God in the West. Agreeing, Lovejoy in May 1827 moved to Boston to earn money for his journey, having settled on Illinois as his destination. Unsuccessful at finding work, he started to Illinois by foot. He stopped in New York City in mid-June, to try to find work. He eventually landed a position with the Saturday Evening Gazette as a newspaper subscription peddler. For nearly five weeks, he walked up and down streets, knocking on peoples' doors and wheedling passersby, in hopes of getting them <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> newspaper. Struggling with his finances, he wrote to Jeremiah Chaplin, the president of Waterville College, explaining his situation. Chaplin sent the money that his former student so needed. Lovejoy promptly embarked on his journey to Illinois, reaching Hillsboro, Montgomery County, in the fall of 1827. Lovejoy did not think he could do well in Illinois's scantly settled land, so he headed for St. Louis.|$|E
25|$|HBO {{pioneered the}} free preview concept – {{which has since}} become a {{standard}} in the pay television industry – in 1973, {{as part of a}} plan to increase subscribership of the channel. Cable providers were originally granted permission to carry HBO on a local origination channel in order for those who are not subscribers the ability to view the channel for a limited number of days; with the advent of digital cable and satellite, providers now unencrypt the designated slots of each HBO channel during preview periods. Until the mid-1990s, on-air promotions featured between programs were replaced (and later, merely interspersed) with interstitials featuring on-air hosts asking viewers <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> service. Although participation was voluntary, preview events are carried by most major and some smaller pay television providers (the number of providers and the providers that choose to offer the event varies depending on the given free preview period, and may not be carried on all systems owned by a multiple system operator unless at the provider's discretion); HBO currently offers between three and five preview events each year to participating providers (which are normally scheduled to coincide with the premiere of a new or returning original series, and in the past, a high-profile special or feature film).|$|E
500|$|The Synod {{still had}} no {{official}} confessional statement. The Church of Scotland and the Irish Synod of Ulster already required clergy <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Westminster Confession. In 1729, the Synod passed the Adopting Act, which required clergy to assent to the Westminster Confession and Larger and Shorter Catechisms. However, subscription was only required for {{those parts of the}} Confession deemed an [...] "essential and necessary article of faith". Ministers could declare any [...] to their presbytery or the Synod, which would then decide if the minister's views were acceptable. While crafted as a compromise, the Adopting Act was opposed by those who favored strict adherence to the Confession.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{case for}} a {{competitive}} market operated by a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) and a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) is analysed in the paper. The resource that is leased by <b>the</b> MNO <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MVNO is spectrum. MNO and MVNO compete à la Bertrand posting subscription prices and the mobile users may choose <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> one operator. <b>The</b> above scenario is modeled by a three-level game comprising a bargaining game, which models the spectrum leasing by the MNO; a competition game, which models the price competition between the MNO and the MVNO; and a subscription game, which models the subscription choice by the mobile users, and the outcome {{of which may be}} either not <b>to</b> <b>subscribe,</b> <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> MNO or <b>to</b> <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> MVNO. <b>The</b> game is solved through backward induction, and each level has a specific solution concept: Shapley value, for the bargain; Nash equilibrium, for the competition; and Wardrop equilibrium, for the subscription. The paper assesses which conditions lead to an equilibrium where the competition does take place, which are expressed as restrictions for the spectrum leasing price agreed at the bargaining, and the spectrum efficiency improvement achieved by the MVNO. Furthermore, it argues that the amount of the leased spectrum should be fixed exogenously in order to achieve optimal user and social welfares. I...|$|R
