Prior to Richard Nixon's announcement of his candidacy, Pat's brother Tom Ryan said, [...] "Pat <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Dick ran for governor {{she was going to}} take her shoe to him." [...] She eventually agreed to another run, citing that it meant a great deal to her husband, but Richard Nixon lost the gubernatorial election to Pat Brown.|$|E
500|$|In the 2011 {{video game}} , when the Joker's {{interview}} tapes are found, Joker retells his origin from The Killing Joke. In this version, he {{reveals that the}} two thugs worked for Carmine Falcone. At {{the end of the}} tapes, Joker apparently blames Batman for what happened to him. Hugo Strange then accuses him of having fabricated a series of events in order to conceal the truth about his condition, as he has read 12 different accounts of his past, all different, except for one detail: Batman. Joker then paraphrases a line from the book: [...] "What can I say? I like to keep things interesting. A wise man once <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{you have to have an}} origin story, you're better off making it multiple choice".|$|E

[...] In 1938–39, playing junior hockey with the Ontario Hockey Association's Toronto Rangers, during a practice Carnegie was pulled aside by his coach and told [...] "See that man sitting in the blues? [...] That's Conn Smythe, owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs. [...] He says he'd take you tomorrow if he could turn you white." [...] Stung by the comments, Carnegie resolved to excel at the game. He was offered a tryout with the Rangers in 1950, then a spot on their lowest minor league team. [...] "They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I signed with the Rangers and went to New Haven, I would make international headlines. [...] I told them my family couldn't eat headlines. [...] That was probably when the Rangers decided to forget about me." ...|$|E

She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> once <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you want to be the best, you must never let anyone, anyone, know what you really feel.

500|$|Berry {{received}} $12.5million for {{the title}} role in the film Catwoman, a $100million movie; it grossed $17million on its first weekend. She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner." [...] The Fund for Animals praised Berry's compassion towards cats and for squelching rumors that she was keeping a Bengal tiger from the sets of Catwoman as a [...] "pet." ...|$|E

He showed {{a keen interest in}} drumming and had aspirations to become a rock star. At age seven, he tried judo and Gōjū-ryū. He took up Kyokushin karate at the age of 10, and began lifting weights as a teenager. Lundgren stated that [...] "My dad always <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I wanted to make something special with my life, I had to go to America." [...] After graduating from high school with straight As, he spent some time in the United States in the 1970s on various academic scholarships, studying chemical engineering at Washington State University and Clemson University. He studied chemical engineering for a year at Washington State University, [...] prior to serving his mandatory one year in the Swedish Marine Corps at the Amphibious Ranger School. [...] In the late 1970s, he enrolled at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and graduated with a degree in chemical engineering.

Fenton returned to Northern Ireland, with Hunter stating [...] "Special Branch <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he came home he would be killed very quickly. They warned me he was a marked man and that it was dangerous to be associated with him and I passed this on to him, but he still went back".

He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> also <b>that</b> <b>if</b> friends he had, he deemed it wiser not to name them, since the least sibilant of the sound of the voice incites to treachery; and in conclusion, that of all men he was acquainted with, one at least never failed to right his humour; and that one was yonder flabby, pallid fellow with the velvet collar to his coat, and the rings on his fingers, and the gold hair, named Pliable, who sat beside Mr. Stubborn on the settle by the fire.|$|R

It is my fault that I am a stranger to you, when I want to be your best friend. That is one of my mistakes, and I never repented it more deeply than I do now. Your father and I had a trouble once, and I thought I could never forgive him; so I kept away for years. Thank God, we made it all up the last time I saw him, and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> then, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he was forced to leave her he should bequeath his little girl to me as a token of his love.

The law didn't run there in those days; and three of his hired gunmen, as they called them, held us up that night in the train and gave her the alternative of going back with them and kissing him or seeing me dead at her feet.

60|$|At {{the end of}} February (1857), at a party {{meeting of}} 160 members, Lord Derby told his men that the course taken by Mr. Disraeli upon the budget had been concerted with him and had his entire approval; spoke with admiration of Mr. Gladstone; {{justified}} political union when produced by men finding themselves drawn to the same lobby by identity of sentiment; and advised them not to decline such accession of strength as would place their party {{in a position to}} undertake the government of the country. The newspapers cried out that the long-expected coalition had at length really taken place. In their hearts the conservative managers were not sure that Mr. Gladstone's adhesion would not cost them too dearly. 'He would only benefit us by his talents' (says Lord Malmesbury) 'for we should lose many of our supporters.

I had only just come up here, with my friend, who is an officer of the Rajah's, when that affair with the tiger took place. Then, as you know, Tippoo made us both officers in the Palace. Of course, while we are here we can do nothing towards finding out about my father, and we should not have remained here much longer anyway, and may have to leave at any moment.

5000|$|In 1935, Wallace-Johnson met Nnamdi Azikiwe, {{the future}} {{nationalist}} President of Nigeria, in Accra. Azikiwe tried to dissociate himself from Wallace-Johnson's Marxist ideologies, as {{he believed that}} there was no chance that his own ideas were compatible with those of his fellow politician. Both men believed that a renaissance needed to occur in Africa, but they disagreed over the methods of doing so. Each man believed that his own idea would prevail in the future. Azikiwe described his first meeting with Wallace-Johnson as such: We exchanged views and I said that while I thought that it would be practicable for Africans at this stage of development to experience an intellectual revolution, yet an extremist or leftist point of view would be dangerous, in view of the unpreparedness of the masses. He countered by pointing out the fate of Soviet Russia, where the masses were illiterate and impoverished, and yet when Lenin, Stalin, and Trotskysounded the clarion; they rallied round them and a new order emerged. I warned him that his analogy was false, because Russia was unlike West Africa; the political, social and economic situations were different. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> point blank <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Africans depended upon intellectuals or leaders of thought, they would not get beyond the stage of producing orators and resolution-passers.

5000|$|George Hamilton {{was writing}} {{a story about a}} bronc rider who became a {{motorcycle}} rider. While preparing to film it, he interviewed various stunt men for the lead role and heard about Knieval. He visited the stuntman in a San Francisco hospital and found him more fascinating than what he was writing. In 1970, Hamilton stated that:In America we've long had a theory that all men have an equal right to become everything they want. But there's a new theory being pushed on us - that every man has to be something whether he wants to or not. That's what the theory of Evil Knievel is about. He's an individual who doesn't care about establishment or hippie, both have their phony sides. I'm not sure why Evil does what he does on a motorcycle. But I do know that by the time the picture is finished I'll be able to say it in one sentence.The screenplay was originally written by Alan Caillou who had written the screenplay for Jack Starrett's The Losers also for Joe Solomon's Fanfare Films. However George Hamilton was not happy with it. He offered to pay John Milius $5,000 to write some lines in the script. Milius says he went to Hamilton's home at Palm Springs to read the script [...] "and it was terrible. So I threw the script in the pool and beat on it with an oar. And of course the script was waterlogged, so I just wrote another one. He later <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he knew <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I got down there with that script I'd write another one." ...|$|R
60|$|From {{these things}} I began to {{instruct}} {{him in the}} knowledge of the true God. I told him, that the great Maker of all things lived there, pointing up towards heaven; that he governs the world by the same power and providence by which he made it; that he was omnipotent, could do every thing for us, give every thing to us, take every thing from us: and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened with great attention, and received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of the manner of making our prayers to God, and his being able to hear us, even into heaven: he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> one day, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> our God could hear us up beyond the sun, he must needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet could not hear, till they went up to the great mountains, where he dwelt, to speak to him. I asked him, if ever he went thither to speak to him? He said, No, they never went that were young men; none went thither but the old men; whom he called their Oowookakee, that is, as I made him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy; and that they went to say O! (so he called saying prayers,) and then came back, and told them what Benamuckee said. By this I observed, that there is priestcraft even amongst the most blinded ignorant Pagans in the world; and the policy of making a secret religion, in order to preserve the veneration of the people to the clergy, is not only {{to be found in the}} Roman, but perhaps among all religious in the world, even among the most brutish and barbarous savages.|$|R
