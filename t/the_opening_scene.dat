It was shot over 24 days at RKO's Gower Street studio in Los Angeles, California, beginning on May 5, 1943, and concluding on May 29. <b>The</b> <b>opening</b> <b>scene</b> at the boarding school used the set featured in RKO's The Magnificent Ambersons, released the year before.|$|E

5|$|When Lark {{received}} the first script, he was disappointed. He felt {{none of the}} characters were likable, and the scene Rucka had described to him over dinner was not included. Rucka wrote a new draft to address Lark's concerns and restored the missing opening scene. Lark began drawing the first issue in January 2013 and based <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>scene</b> on the birth sequence in The Fifth Element.|$|E
5|$|As {{was common}} in Victorian drama, a woman (Maggie Brennan) played {{a young man}} (Peter). The play's script assigns {{dialogue}} to three numbered villagers in <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>scene.</b> The named character of Jacques has no more lines than any of these and disappears after {{the first page of}} the script. Righton, who first played Boomblehardt, portrayed him as a Jewish caricature. Gilbert's script did not use a Jewish dialect, and historian Jane Stedman suggests that Righton's increasingly broad portrayal and interpolations show that Gilbert had little control of Righton's portrayal of the part.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{the main}} storyline being a retelling of the Hansel and Gretel fairytale, the episode {{contained}} {{a number of}} other cultural references. A rack full of Marvel Comics, including Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk, are shown in <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>scene,</b> a double reference to both Marvel's parent company, Disney and the comic book's writer, Damon Lindelof, co-creator of Lost. An Apollo Bar was among the stolen items, and the Stranger's motorcycle license plate reads 23, both also references to Lost. Other comic books seen on the convenience store rack include various issues of Dazzler, Power Pack, West Coast Avengers, and Ka-Zar.|$|E
5|$|Director David Silverman had {{difficulty}} devising a legible Scrabble board for <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>scene</b> that would convey {{the idea that}} the Simpsons were only able to devise very simple words. The design of Bart's visualization of the math problem was partially inspired by the art of Saul Steinberg. The increasing appearance of numbers in that sequence derived from Silverman's use of a similar tactic when he had to develop a set design for the play The Adding Machine.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the show was {{operating}} on a strict budget, shots of the Chinese freighter were almost entirely created by digital technology or other special effects. For <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>scene</b> of the ship at sea, a matte painting of a boat based on a toy model was superimposed onto a film strip of an empty ocean. Several scenes featuring the boat in port were created by filming an empty harbor and then superimposing a ship via digital technology. Special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich created a latex appliance that enabled the veterinarian to have his throat bitten out.|$|E

5|$|Gregson-Williams' {{score is}} darker {{to follow suit}} with the film. Gregson-Williams wanted Caspian's theme to convey a vulnerability, which would sound more vibrant as he became more heroic. It {{originally}} used a 3/4 time signature, but <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>scene</b> required a 4/4 and thus it was changed. To represent Miraz's cunning, the heroic theme from the first film was inverted. For Reepicheep, a muted trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character. Gregson-Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle, but found that it sounded too cute and broke the tension of the night raid.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>scene</b> of the episode, Chris alerts {{his parents}} of a failing grade he {{received}} at school on a science test, causing his mother to suggest he receive help on his homework.

Peter then suggests that his son {{would have to do}} a better job than God when he created actresses Ellen Barkin and Kelly McGillis.|$|E
