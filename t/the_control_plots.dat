30|$|Plant biomass in the {{macropore}} {{plot was}} almost double that in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plot,</b> and soil carbon {{was found to}} have increased significantly in the macropore <b>plot</b> compared with <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plot.</b> <b>The</b> artificial macropore successfully introduced surface water and organic matter into soils, which then stimulated vegetation growth.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the water content at 50  cm {{tended to be}} higher in the {{macropore}} <b>plot</b> than in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plot,</b> especially after December, because the water content is affected by rainfall and our experimental plots are located in Japan's San-in region, where snow and sleet are normally heavy during the winter months. Thus, {{it is estimated that}} winter snow and sleet introduced water 50  cm deep via the macropores. However, the water content at 30  cm was larger in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plot</b> than in <b>the</b> macropore plot, even during the winter season.

For the veneer tree subsample, differences in means were not significant at the 0.05 level of significance for any of the measured tree variables.|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} leaves per plant {{increased}} with increase in poultry manure rate. Applications up poultry manure at all {{rates in the}} entire plots generated high weed yield that <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> were significantly lower (p 0. 05) than plots with poultry manure. Weeds were suppressed because <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> were degraded and had low soil fertility. After the experiments, the plots with poultry manure were more fertile than <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots.</b> Thus, there were increases in soil N (0. 84 %), organic matter (3. 93 %) P (13. 45 ppm), while the exchangeable cations K (0. 76), Ca (0. 71) and Mg (0. 63) Cmol (+) kg- 1, respectively.

30|$|In {{comparison}} to <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots,</b> treated plots had around {{twice as many}} young trees between 5 and 15  cm dbh (Fig.  2) before and after harvesting. For emergent trees (100  + cm dbh), a clear trend existed, with most trees in this diameter class in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> (max. diameter 160  cm) and few in the LRBA plots (max. diameter 105  cm). The LRBA plots had already fewer emergent trees before harvesting (plots had been slightly subjected to “selective” cuts {{in the past as}} mentioned above) but the difference became more pronounced after single-tree selection cutting. Additionally, selection cutting reduced the number of large trees (50 – 100  cm dbh), especially in the LRBA plots (Fig.  2).|$|E
30|$|In {{the data}} analysis, the models project the volume for one {{measurement}} only resulting in short projection periods. Consequently, evaluating the residuals {{from the analysis}} does not give a good indication of model performance {{over a long period}} of time, as would be useful in a real application. A more pragmatic test was performed by projecting the volumes with the first post-treatment observation (or first observations for <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots)</b> and examining the residuals from these projections. This was done for <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> and plots that only had one treatment in order to isolate the model behaviour by treatment type. The residual variance increased as the length of the projection period increased as is typical in yield projections. <b>The</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> did not show any bias over the projection period, nor did the fertilised western hemlock plots. The thinned Douglas-fir plots and the fertilised Douglas-fir plots each showed a bias of about 1  m 3 /ha/yr and the thinned western hemlock plots had a bias of less than 2  m 3 /ha/yr. These biases are small but nevertheless could be an area of future refinement to the models. In practice, periodic stand volume measurements could be taken and used as input to the model to reduce the length of future stand volume projections.|$|E
40|$|A {{dramatic}} {{reduction in}} soil frost depth {{has been reported}} for Hokkaido Island of northern Japan over the last 20 years. Since soil frost strongly affects snowmelt infiltration and runoff, the reduction in frost depth may have altered the water and nutrient cycles in this region. A paired‐plot experiment was conducted in an agricultural field in Tokachi, Hokkaido, to compare the movement of soil water at different frost depths, <b>controlled</b> by manipulating <b>the</b> depth of snow cover. Snow was removed to enhance soil freezing in the treatment plot and was undisturbed in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plot.</b> <b>The</b> soil froze to a maximum depth of 0. 43 m under the treatment plot and 0. 11 m under <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plot.</b> During <b>the</b> freezing period, the amount of upward soil water flux toward the freezing front in the treatment plot was more than double that in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plot.</b> During <b>the</b> snowmelt period, infiltration of meltwater was unimpeded by the thin frozen layer in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plot,</b> whereas <b>the</b> relatively thick frozen layer in the treatment plot impeded infiltration and generated 63 mm of runoff. These results clearly show that {{the changes in the}} timing and thickness of snow cover deposition can cause a dramatic reduction of frost depth and change in the soil water dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Utilizing passive floodwater for spate {{irrigation}} in arid {{areas is}} an opportunity to use marginal water for production of crops. These techniques have only partially been studied in an extensive way. This paper describes a floodwater harvesting and spreading system for spate irrigation and field experiments for cultivation of barley. The field experiments were carried out during a three-year period. The area is noteworthy for its erratic and scarce rainfall. Due to the scarce and late rainfall, only in the second year experiment barley yield was achieved. On December 5, 2009, barley was planted in one trial plot and subsequently received spate irrigation on December 8. On December 16, 2009, barley was planted in a second trial plot and in a <b>control</b> <b>plot</b> outside <b>the</b> system.

40|$|The {{application}} of municipal biosolids during reclamation {{has been gaining}} acceptance in recent years. A series of reclamation test sites were established at the Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah during 1995 and 1996. These test sites were established on the tailings impoundment surface, on capped waste rock surfaces and on a gravel-borrow area. At each site, biosolids were applied to plots at rates of between 10 and 30 dry tons/acre, and control plots received identical treatments with the exception that biosolids were not applied. Vegetative community surveys were conducted at seven of these paired plots {{in the summer of}} 2001. After five to six years of growth, the biosolids plots generally contained a higher percent cover, ~ 75 % of which was provided by volunteer weed species. On average, cheat grass (Bromus tectorum) alone accounted for over half of the total cover at the biosolids plots. <b>The</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots,</b> where biosolids were not applied, generally had less total cover, but weedy species accounted for less than 20 % of the cover that was present. On average, the absolute cover provided by non-weedy species at <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> was about twice as high as at the biosolids plots. The species diversity of non-weedy species at <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> was also higher than at the biosolids plots...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the impact of three types of compost on soil physical properties of a silt loam in a long-term experiment. Soil organic carbon (SOC) was measured every other year and moisture content was monitored since 2005; consistency limits were determined on samples taken 15 years after the start of the experiment. SOC continuously increased in the amended plots, while it remained stable or decreased in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots.</b> Bulk density (ρb) increased (and correspondingly, available pore space decreased) in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots.</b> The consistency limits were higher in the amended plots; for two treatments the change at the plastic limit was significant, compared to the control.

40|$|Increasing {{nitrogen}} (N) deposition {{may affect}} carbon and nutrient dynamics in forest ecosystems. To {{better understand the}} effects of N deposition, we need to improve our knowledge of N effects on fine roots (roots < 2 mm in diameter), as they are {{a key factor in}} carbon and nutrient dynamics. In this study, we fertilized 1 &# 215; 2 m plots in a sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) stand (336 kg ha- 1 y- 1) for three years and evaluated the responses of the fine roots to high N load. After fertilization, the concentration of NO 3 -N in the soil of N-fertilized (NF) plots was 5 -times as large as that in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> and the effect was more remarkable in the subsurface soil than in the surface soil. The biomass of fine roots < 2 mm in diameter appeared to be greater in the NF plots (88 &# 177; 19 g m- 2) than in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> (56 &# 177; 14 g m- 2), but this difference was not statistically significant. In both plots, 76 % of the biomass was accounted for by fine roots that were < 1 mm in diameter. In the surface soil, the specific root length (SRL) of fine roots < 1 mm in diameter was significantly greater, and the diameter of those fine roots was marginally smaller, in the NF plots than in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots.</b> In addition, the concentration of N in fine roots < 1 mm in diameter was marginally greater in the NF plots than in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots.</b> There may have been increased production of thinner fine roots or increased root branching in the NF plots. This study suggests that, in general, high N load is likely to have positive effects on sugi in terms of fine root characteristics and the effects on fine-root morphology are more evident than the effects on fine-root biomass...|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. December 2010. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisors: Dr. John Gulliver, Dr. John Nieber. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 127 pages, appendices A-B. Soils in urban environments typically have lower stormwater infiltration rates than the soils they replace due to reduced topsoil depth and increased subsoil compaction from land development. Loss of infiltration leads to increased stormwater runoff and associated downstream problems: flooding, pollutant transport, and warming stream temperatures. A field experiment {{was conducted to}} determine the effectiveness of remediation techniques to alleviate soil compaction and increase infiltration. Deep tillage and compost addition are two techniques commonly used in agricultural practices to reduce the level soil compaction. These techniques were implemented on three sites in the metropolitan area. Each site was divided into three plots: tilled, tilled with compost addition, and a <b>control</b> <b>plot</b> for comparison. To determine the effectiveness of each remediation technique, before and after measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), soil bulk density, and soil strength {{were used to assess}} the level of compaction. Deep tillage was effective at reducing the level of soil strength. Soil strength was approximately half that of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plot</b> in <b>the</b> first six inches of soil. However, tilling did not significantly improve the bulk density of the soil. At two of the sites, tilling was ineffective at improving that infiltration capacity of the soil. Tilling may have damaged natural pathways in the soils, thus reducing the permeability. Tilling was effective at remediating the soil at one site, which was not as well-established at the previous two sites. The geometric mean of Ksat was 2. 1 to 2. 3 times that of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plot</b> Compost addition was the most effective soil remediation technique. Similar reductions in soil strength were found as the till plot. Soil bulk densities on the compost plots were 18 - 37 % lower than <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plot.</b> <b>The</b> infiltration capacity of the soil was improved. The geometric mean of Ksat on the compost plots was 2. 7 to 5. 7 times that of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plot.</b> <b>The</b> results of these findings will be useful in revising stormwater best management practices to include guidelines on soil compaction prevention and remediation of compacted sites...|$|R

This study assessed post-fire erosion rates {{and the effectiveness of}} seeding, straw mulching, and contour felling in reducing erosion after a June 2000 wildfire northwest of Loveland, Colorado. Site characteristics and sediment yields were measured on 12 burned and untreated control plots and 22 burned and treated plots from 2000 to 2003. The size of the hillslope plots ranged from 0 Ð 015 to 0 Ð 86 ha. Sediment yields varied significantly by treatment and were most closely correlated with the amount of ground cover. On <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> the mean sediment yield declined from 6 – 10 Mg ha 1 {{in the first two years}} after burning to 1 Ð 2 Mgha 1 in 2002 and 0 Ð 7 Mgha 1 in 2003. Natural regrowth caused the amount of ground cover on <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> to increase progressively from 33 % in fall 2000 to 88 % in fall 2003.

40|$|Exclosure plots were {{monitored}} {{to investigate}} the impact of browsing on seedling recruitment by Trichosurus vulpecula, Oryctolagus cuniculus and Rattus rattus on seedlings under Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides plantings in two Auckland Regional Council Parks (ARC), Shakespear and Wenderholm. The number of woody seedlings that established over a 17 -month period was recorded. Gaps within the same Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopy were created {{to investigate the}} influence of the canopy on seedling recruitment. Soil samples were taken to investigate the existing seed bank beneath the same Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopies. At Wenderholm, net change in seedling density differed among treatments (P= 0. 014). Seedling density increased within the plots that excluded Trichosurus vulpecula and Oryctolagus cuniculus and within plots that additionally excluded Rattus rattus, but declined in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots.</b> In contrast at Shakespear, although seedling density increased more within both the exclosure plots than in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots,</b> this result was not statistically significant (P= 0. 728). At Wenderholm, the average seedling height increased within both types of exclosure plots, but declined in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots.</b> However, these differences among treatments were not statistically significant (P= 0. 204). At Shakespear, seedlings increased in height within the Trichosurus vulpecula, Oryctolagus cuniculus and Rattus rattus exclosures and declined marginally in the other two treatments. Again, differences in height change among treatments were not statistically significant (P= 0. 202). At both regional parks, the greatest cause of mortality within the exclosures excluding Trichosurus vulpecula and Oryctolagus cuniculus was desiccation. All of the mortalities within the Trichosurus vulpecula, Oryctolagus cuniculus and Rattus rattus exclosures was unidentifiable. However, within <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots,</b> at Wenderholm, the greatest identified cause of mortality was browsing and at Shakespear, the only cause of mortality within <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> was browsing. Seedbanks at Wenderholm and Shakespear under the Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides plantings were dominated by forb species. A total of 1308 seedlings germinated from soil taken from Wenderholm, with exotic species making up 99. 4 % of germinations, with exotic species making up 97. 9 % of germinations. Similarly a total of 801 seedlings germinated from soil samples taken from Shakespear. At Wenderholm, the number of native seedling germinations within the gaps created in the Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopy, was more than twice the number that germinated under the closed canopy. However, this difference was marginally non-significant (P= 0. 065). At Shakespear, the number of native seedling germinations within gaps created in the Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopy was similar to the number that germinated under the closed canopy (P= 0. 2603). The results suggest that at Wenderholm, despite ongoing predator control, Trichosurus vulpecula and/or Oryctolagus cuniculus have had an adverse effect on the survival and growth of seedlings. The results also suggest that at Shakespear, Rattus rattus have had an adverse effect on the survival and growth of seedlings under the Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopy. The distance from mature forest may also have {{had an impact on the}} dispersal of native seeds within the Leptospermum scoparium and Kunzea ericoides canopy. The implication of these results for the future management of restoration plantings in regional parks is discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} effect of a large {{ungulate}} carcass on boreal forest biodiversity by contrasting the local abundance and diversity of Coleoptera around a roe deer Capreolus capreolus carcass and in a <b>control</b> <b>plot,</b> between 8 August and 3 September 2003, in southern Norway. The two plots differed both in occurrence and richness of species, which were almost double at the carcass plot, although the diversity indices were similar. The higher evenness of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plot</b> compensated for its lower number of species, probably because the carcass plot was a disturbed area, colonized by many species, which were represented by few individuals. The number of beetles captured each day correlated positively with temperature at <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plot,</b> but not at the carcass plot, indicating that the presence of an abundant and concentrated resource increased the local activity of Coleoptera. The carcass is likely to create a particular microclimate, which could partly buffer against extremes of air-temperature variation. These preliminary results indicate that ungulate carcasses have a significant ecological impact, which should be further investigated to improve the management and restoration of European boreal forest ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Runoff, interrill erosion, {{and growth}} of erosion control {{vegetation}} and weeds were measured on conventionally treated portions (control) of newly constructed roadway embankments, and on areas pretreated with topsoil or one of three different types of composted organics. Runoff rates and interrill erosion rates from <b>the</b> <b>control</b> and topsoil-treated <b>plots</b> were highest. Runoff rates from the three compost media (biosolids, yard waste, bio-industrial waste) used were statistically lower than <b>the</b> <b>control.</b> Runoff from <b>plots</b> treated with yard waste and bio-industrial waste composts were statistically lower from plots treated with topsoil.

40|$|Recently, {{the farm}} land {{reclamation}} by machine power {{was carried out}} {{various parts of the}} country, and the reclaimed area is increasing in Japan. It was considerd that the physical properties of reclaimed soil differ from it of the residual soil of shale by weathering. In the present paper, the investigation was carried out on the conditions of growth of orange trees and physical properties of soil in the orange orchard. A-orchard reclaimed by human power, and examination farm reclaimed cutting and banking by machine power are used plots of investigation. And <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plot</b> is adopted A-orchard. Furthermore, the orange tree on object of investigation was mandarin orange that the age of trees were 20 years old. The results of measurement are summarised as follows; (1) The growth of orange trees is good on the early variety on the cutting part of experimental farm and on the medium variety on <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>plot.</b> In generally, <b>the</b> growth of trees was better on A-orchard of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> than experimental farm. (2) The surface soil in the investigated plots is containing organic matters of 1. 1 ～ 5. 7 ％. (3) The consistency limit was that liquid limit is 47 ～ 60 ％ at surface soil, and 42 - 52 ％ at subsoil, and the placity limit is 27 ～ 34 ％ at surface soil, 25 ～ 43 ％ at subsoil, respectively. (4) The soil hardness of experimental farm is hard than on <b>the</b> A-orchard of <b>control</b> <b>plot,</b> and that is most hard at the 10 ～ 20 cm soil layer in each of the investigated plots. But, at <b>the</b> A-orchard of <b>control</b> <b>plot</b> was tended to decreasing in accordance with the depth. (5) In three phase distribution of natural conditions, the ratio of solid, liquid and vapor phases are about 48 ％, 32. 5 ％, 19. 5 ％ on <b>the</b> A-orchard of <b>control</b> <b>plot,</b> and are about 53. 1 ％, 29. 4 ％, 17. 7 ％ on the experimental farm, respectively. (6) The non-capillary pore and the available soil water were high values about 4. 8 ％, 3. 5 ％ on A-orchard of <b>control</b> <b>plot</b> respectively, and there is no difference among investigated plots in the experimental farm...|$|R
