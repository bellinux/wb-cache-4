5|$|Each of the valid Band1 {{permutations}} can {{be expanded}} (completed) into a specific number of solutions with the Band2,3 permutations.

Consequently, we only need to construct the solutions for one member of each equivalence class and then multiply the number of solutions {{by the size of}} the equivalence class. We are still left with the task of identifying and calculating the size of each equivalence class. Further progress requires the dexterous application of computational techniques to catalogue (classify and count) the permutations into equivalence classes.|$|E
