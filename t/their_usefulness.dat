Optical aids are allowed {{as long as}} they are not mounted on the pistol, which may only have open sights. Ear protection is recommended by the ISSF as well as by coaches, who sometimes stress <b>their</b> <b>usefulness</b> in shutting out distracting noise rather than their necessity for safety reasons (paramount in other shooting disciplines).|$|E
5|$|If the ylide carbon is {{substituted}} with an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), the reagent {{is referred}} to as a stabilized ylide. These, similarly to sulfoxonium reagents, react much slower and are typically easier to prepare. These are limited in <b>their</b> <b>usefulness</b> as the reaction can become prohibitively sluggish: examples involving amides are widespread, with many fewer involving esters and virtually no examples involving other EWG's. For these, the related Darzens reaction is typically more appropriate.|$|E

5|$|Donnchadh's {{career is}} not well {{documented}} in the surviving sources. Charters provide a little information about some of his activities, but overall <b>their</b> <b>usefulness</b> is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called cartularies) from the Gaelic south-west have survived the Middle Ages, and the only surviving charters relevant to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily Normanised English-speaking area to the east. Principally, the relevant charters record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned {{in the body of}} these texts and the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.|$|E
5|$|Elected {{officials}} on Staten Island such as Diane Savino have been demanding {{the replacement of}} the Staten Island Railway's aging R44 train cars. Initially, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority planned to order R179s for the Staten Island Railway, but later decided to overhaul some R46s to replace the existing R44s there. However, the plan to overhaul the R46s for the Staten Island Railway was also dropped, and 75 future R211S cars are planned to replace the Staten Island Railway's fleet of R44s instead. Until then, the R44s are undergoing another round of scheduled maintenance to extend <b>their</b> <b>usefulness</b> until at least 2023.|$|E
5|$|The oxazolidinones {{have been}} known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors since the late 1950s. Their {{antimicrobial}} properties were discovered by researchers at E.I. duPont de Nemours in the 1970s. In 1978, DuPont patented a series of oxazolidinone derivatives as being effective {{in the treatment of}} bacterial and fungal plant diseases, and in 1984, another patent described <b>their</b> <b>usefulness</b> in treating bacterial infections in mammals. In 1987, DuPont scientists presented {{a detailed description of the}} oxazolidinones as a new class of antibiotics with a novel mechanism of action. Early compounds were found to produce liver toxicity, however, and development was discontinued.|$|E

5|$|While Star Trek {{in general}} {{features}} few overt references to religion, {{there is a}} clear recognition that a laying aside of past hurts is necessary for peace, similar to the concept of shalom in Judaism. Shatner regretted that Kirk's angst at being outmoded was minimized in the final print. A scene where Spock asks Kirk if they have grown so old and inflexible they have outlived <b>their</b> <b>usefulness</b> had two meanings: it was as much Nimoy asking Shatner as it was their characters.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{judicial}} system still existed in Buenos Aires, Rosas removed any independence the courts might have exercised, either by controlling appointments to the judiciary, or by circumventing their authority entirely. He {{would sit in}} judgement over cases, issuing sentences which included fines, service in the army, imprisonment, or execution. The exercise of state terror {{as a tool of}} intimidation was restricted to Rosas himself; his subordinates had no control over it. It was used against specific targets, rather than randomly. Terrorism was orchestrated rather than a product of popular zeal, was targeted for effect rather than indiscriminate. Anarchic demonstrations, vigilantism and disorderliness were antithetical to a regime touting a law and order agenda. Foreigners were exempted from abuses, as were people too poor or inconsequential to serve as effective examples. Victims were selected for <b>their</b> <b>usefulness</b> as tools of intimidation.|$|E
5|$|Salicylate medicines—including salicin, {{salicylic}} acid, {{and sodium}} salicylate— were difficult and wasteful to extract from plants, and in 1860 Hermann Kolbe {{worked out a}} way to synthesize salicylic acid. Throughout the late 1800s use of salicylates grew considerably, and physicians increasingly knew what to expect from these medicines: reduction of pain, fever, and inflammation. However, the unpleasant side effects, particularly gastric irritation, limited <b>their</b> <b>usefulness,</b> as did their intense bitterness. By the 1880s, the German chemical industry, jump-started by the lucrative development of dyes from coal tar, was branching out to investigate the potential of new tar-derived medicines. The turning point was the advent of Kalle & Company's Antifebrine, the branded version of the well-known dye derivative acetanilide—the fever-reducing properties of which were discovered by accident in 1886. Antifebrine's success inspired Carl Duisberg, the head of research at the small dye firm Friedrich Bayer & Company, to start a systematic search for other chemical fever-reducers. Bayer chemists soon developed Phenacetin, followed by the sedatives Sulfonal and Trional.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6, the {{gameplay}} emphasizes {{horror and}} exploration over action. The inventory uses a grid-based system {{with an initial}} capacity of 12 slots, but may be expanded several times {{over the course of}} the game. An item can occupy up to two spaces, and four items may be assigned to the D-pad. Item boxes found in save rooms may also be used to manage and store items for later use, and be retrieved from different item boxes. Items in the inventory can be used, examined, or combined with other items to increase <b>their</b> <b>usefulness.</b> Many of the game's puzzles require that items be examined under certain conditions in order to reveal secrets. Tape recorders can be used to manually save the game's progress, which depending on the given difficulty level, may require the use of a cassette tape. Videotapes are scattered for Ethan to find, which place the player in the perspective of a different character, oftentimes revealing plot information or clues needed to solve a puzzle.|$|E
5|$|Partial {{agonists}} {{are defined}} as drugs that, at a given receptor, might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy. Although they are agonists, partial agonists {{can act as a}} competitive antagonist {{in the presence of a}} full agonist, as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone. Clinically, <b>their</b> <b>usefulness</b> is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant, weak level of activity, whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels. In addition, it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, binds with weak morphine-like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence.|$|E
5|$|Sovereign {{reveals that}} the Reapers remain outside the Milky Way waiting for organic life to develop and {{discover}} the Mass Relays, before harvesting them when they reach their peak. Afterwards, with the bomb about to explode, Shepard hears that Ashley and Kaidan have both been pinned down, and must choose which one to rescue. Shepard also finds Saren, who claims that his allegiance to Sovereign will save organic life forms by demonstrating <b>their</b> <b>usefulness</b> to the Reapers. Liara is then able to pinpoint the Conduit's location back on the Normandy: a Prothean world known as Ilos. There, Shepard learns that the Citadel Station is actually a huge Mass Relay that the Reapers use to invade the galaxy. During the last extinction cycle, a few Protheans survived on Ilos via cryopreservation and then re-entered the Citadel Station via the Conduit, a reverse-engineered miniature Mass Relay disguised aboard the station as a statue. The Protheans sabotaged the Citadel to prevent the Reapers from remotely activating the Citadel Mass Relay. Saren plans to reach the Citadel by using the Conduit to allow Sovereign to activate the Citadel Mass Relay and trigger the Reaper invasion.|$|E
