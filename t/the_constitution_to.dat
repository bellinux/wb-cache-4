5|$|African {{slaves were}} {{originally}} excluded from United States citizenship. In 1857, the United States Supreme Court held in Dred Scott v. Sandford that slaves, former slaves, {{and their descendants}} were not eligible under <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>to</b> be citizens. Additionally, American Indians were not originally recognized as citizens, since Indian tribes {{were considered to be}} outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. government.|$|E
5|$|Constitutionalism {{was only}} {{established}} {{during the reign}} Abdul Hamid II, who thus became the empire's last absolute ruler and its reluctant first constitutional monarch. Although Abdul Hamid II abolished the parliament and <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> return to personal rule in 1878, he was again forced in 1908 to reinstall constitutionalism and was deposed. Since 2017, {{the head of the}} House of Osman and pretender to the defunct Ottoman throne has been Dündar Ali Osman, a great-grandson of Abdulhamid II.|$|E
5|$|Déby {{attempted}} {{to reconcile the}} rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved a new constitution by referendum, and in 1996, Déby easily won a competitive presidential election. He won a second term five years later. Oil exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad would at last have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a new civil war broke out. Déby unilaterally modified <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties.|$|E

50|$|The Albanian {{minority}} parties consider <b>the</b> new <b>Constitution</b> <b>to</b> {{be against}} <b>the</b> {{interests of the}} Albanian people.

5|$|For <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> be ratified, however, {{nine of the}} {{thirteen}} states were required to approve it in state conventions. Opposition to ratification ("Anti-Federalism") was partly based on the Constitution's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties. Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification (including Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for {{the addition of a}} bill of rights. Four state conventions proposed some form of restriction on the authority of the new federal government to conduct searches.|$|E
5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress {{was very careful}} to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that {{is all that is}} needed to decide the case, but that the Court went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians. Finally, Kennedy was concerned that the court did not address the question of the Equal Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda has low {{corruption}} levels {{relative to}} most other African countries; in 2014, Transparency International ranked Rwanda as the fifth cleanest out of 47 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and 55th cleanest out of 175 in the world. The constitution provides for an Ombudsman, whose duties include prevention and fighting of corruption. Public officials (including the President) {{are required by}} <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> declare their wealth to the Ombudsman and to the public; {{those who do not}} comply are suspended from office.|$|E

Section 2 was condemned by women's suffragists, such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, who had long seen their cause as linked to that of black rights. The separation of black civil rights from women's civil rights split the two movements for decades.|$|E
5|$|A {{referendum}} in Croatia {{can be called}} by the Parliament or the President on any issue falling within the purview of parliament, or on any other issue the president considers important to the independence, unity and existence of the republic. Since the constitution was amended in 2001, parliament is obligated by <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> call for a referendum if signatures of 10 percent of registered Croatian voters are collected. The signatures, by law, must be collected within a 15-day period. Referendums are regulated by Article 87 of the constitution of Croatia which requires that the parliament passes an act on each referendum and that the outcome is binding unless the referendum is called as an advisory referendum.|$|E
5|$|Despite their successes, {{these three}} dissenters grew {{increasingly}} unpopular as most other delegates {{wanted to bring}} the Convention's business {{to an end and}} return home. As the Convention was drawing to a conclusion, and delegates prepared to refer <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>to</b> the Committee on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an objection over civil trials. He wanted to guarantee the right to a jury trial in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity. Mason told the Convention that the constitution should include a bill of rights, which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them. They wanted to go home, and thought this was nothing more than another delaying tactic.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1794, {{engraver}} Robert Scot began preparing {{designs for}} the silver dollar. Scot's initial design depicted a bust of Liberty, while his reverse featured an eagle, both required by the 1792 Coinage Act. Scot's design closely followed his design for the cent, but with the Phrygian cap removed. Government officials later instructed Scot to include a wreath around the eagle and to move the denomination from the reverse face {{to the edge of}} the coin. After receiving approval, Scot began engraving the hubs for the new silver dollar. Extra care was taken during the engraving of this denomination, because the dollar would be the largest American coin, and would thus receive the most scrutiny from foreign nations. The lettering was executed by Frederick Geiger, who had worked as a typographer for various books and newspapers. After the dies were created, several copper test pieces were struck. Officials decided to add fifteen stars around the periphery, representing the fifteen states that had ratified <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>to</b> that point, to the right-facing Liberty on the obverse.|$|E
5|$|Gromoboi {{was built}} by the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg. Construction began on 14 June 1897, {{although}} she was not formally laid down until 7 May 1898, and the ship was launched on 8 May 1899. She was transferred to Kronstadt on 24 November 1899 to finish fitting out, but was forced aground by sea ice. She was freed three days later, but needed repairs to her sheathing. She left Liepāja on 10 December 1900 {{en route to the}} Far East and stopped briefly at Kiel, where she was inspected by Prince Henry of Prussia, and at Plymouth where the officers visited the Devonport naval base. She represented Russia at the granting of <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> Australia, visiting Sydney and Melbourne in April–May 1901, before visiting Nagasaki in July. Gromoboi finally reached Port Arthur on 29 July 1901. She remained in the Pacific until the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. During this voyage she was commanded by Karl Petrovich Jessen.|$|E
5|$|In April 1973, anti-Chogyal {{agitation}} {{broke out}} and protestors demanded popular elections. The Sikkim police {{were unable to}} control the demonstrations, and Dorji asked India to exercise its responsibility for law and order and intervene. India facilitated negotiations between the Chogyal and Dorji, and produced an agreement, which envisaged {{the reduction of the}} Chogyal to the role of a constitutional monarch and the holding of elections based on a new ethnic power-sharing formula. The Chogyal's opponents won an overwhelming victory, and a new Constitution was drafted providing for Sikkim {{to be associated with the}} Republic of India. On 10 April 1975, the Sikkim Assembly passed a resolution calling for the state to be fully integrated into India. This resolution was endorsed by 97 percent of the vote in a referendum held on 14 April 1975, following which the Indian Parliament amended <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> admit Sikkim into India as its 22nd state.|$|E

5|$|In July 2003 general {{elections}} were held again, and the CPP won. However, {{they failed to}} secure two-thirds of all parliamentary seats, as required by <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> form a new government. The two runner-up parties of the election, FUNCINPEC and SRP, blocked the CPP from doing so. Instead, in August 2003 they filed complaints with the Constitutional Council over alleged electoral irregularities. After their complaints were rejected, FUNCINPEC and SRP threatened to boycott the swearing-in ceremony of parliamentarians. Sihanouk coaxed both parties to change their decision, stating that he would abstain from presiding over the ceremony as well {{if they did not}} comply with his wishes. Both parties eventually backed off from their threats, and the swearing-in ceremony was held in October 2003, with Sihanouk in attendance. The CPP, FUNCINPEC, and SRP held additional talks into 2004 to break the political stalemate, but to no avail. At the same time, Sihanouk proposed a unity government jointly led by politicians from all three political parties, which Hun Sen and Ranariddh both rebuffed.|$|E
5|$|In early 1947, Quwatli and the National Party, {{the largest}} party in parliament, made an {{amendment}} to <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> enable Quwatli to seek re-election. The move was met by strong disapproval from rival Syrian parties and opposition politicians, and a campaign to unseat Quwatli in the next presidential election was commenced. Quwatli's allies won 24 out of 127 seats during the 1947 parliamentary election, the first in post-independence Syria, while the opposition won 53 seats and independents unaffiliated with any political party won 50. A number of Quwatli's allies defected from the National Party and former president Atassi retired from politics because of his frustration at Quwatli's handling of Syrian internal affairs. Quwatli tasked Jamil Mardam Bey {{to form a new}} cabinet in October, which included mostly pro-Western politicians.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner was reelected in 2011. The Constitution of Argentina allows {{only one}} reelection. Many of her {{supporters}} proposed {{an amendment to}} <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>to</b> allow indefinite reelections. Kirchner did not publicly support the proposal, but did not discourage or reject it either. The proposal was not taken to the Congress, as the FPV still lacked the required two-thirds majority to approve an amendment bill. It was rejected by many sectors of society. The first big demonstration (a cacerolazo) took place in September 2012. It was not called by specific politicians or social leaders, but by the public using social networks. The massive turnout was completely unexpected by both {{the government and the}} opposition. People also protested the 2012 Buenos Aires rail disaster, the conflict between Kirchnerism and the media, rising crime rates, and the tight currency controls. Kirchner dismissed the demonstration, and said that she would continue working as before. Most of the Kirchner loyalists, however, preferred simply to ignore the protest.|$|E

5|$|Lunalilo left no heirs. The {{legislature}} was {{empowered by}} <b>the</b> <b>constitution</b> <b>to</b> elect the monarch {{in these instances}} and chose David Kalākaua as the next monarch. The new ruler was pressured by the U.S. government to surrender Pearl Harbor to the Navy. Kalākaua was concerned that this would lead to annexation by the U.S. and to the contravening of {{the traditions of the}} Hawaiian people, who believed that the land ('Āina) was fertile, sacred, and not for sale to anyone. In 1875, the United States Congress agreed to an additional seven years of reciprocity in exchange for Ford Island. At the end of the seven-year reciprocity agreement, the United States showed little interest in renewal.|$|E
5|$|The German Church of Scientology has {{repeatedly}} challenged {{the legality of}} this surveillance in court. In December 2001, the Administrative Court in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff {{and members of the}} Church of Scientology Berlin as paid informants. The court ruled that the use of informants was disproportionate. In 2003, the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of <b>the</b> <b>Constitution</b> <b>to</b> include the activities of Scientology in its report, given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution.|$|E
5|$|The Governor would {{consult the}} Executive Council in the {{exercise}} of all his functions (except on trivial or urgent matters or where the public interest made it undesirable).
