25|$|North of Pelham Bay Park, the QBx1 ran several {{different}} services to {{different parts of}} Co-op City. The full route circumscribed the entire development, running (clockwise) north along the New England Thruway service road to Bartow Avenue (near the current Bay Plaza Shopping Center), <b>through</b> <b>Section</b> 1, via the Dreiser Loop, through Sections 2 and 3, via the Asch Loop in Section 4, and <b>through</b> <b>Section</b> 5 before returning to Pelham Bay. This pattern operated clockwise (sections 1-2-3-4-5) or counterclockwise (sections 5-4-3-2-1). The full Flushing−Co-op City service either ran clockwise from Flushing or counterclockwise to Flushing.|$|E
25|$|Further, the court's {{decision}} {{prompted the}} FCC to establish new rules regarding internet regulations. Because {{of the ruling}} in this case, these rules justify themselves in new ways, namely claiming direct authority <b>through</b> <b>section</b> 706 of the Communications Act, as well as ancillary authority through Title II and VI of the Act. While these justifications avoid the direct complaints raised in this case, {{it is not clear}} whether they would hold up on appeal.|$|E
25|$|Censure is {{an action}} by the House of Commons or the Senate rebuking the actions or conduct of an individual. The power to censure is not {{directly}} mentioned in the constitutional texts of Canada but {{is derived from the}} powers bestowed upon both Chambers <b>through</b> <b>section</b> 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867. A motion of censure can be introduced by any Member of Parliament or Senator and passed by a simple majority for censure to be deemed to have been delivered. In addition, if the censure is related to the privileges of the Chamber, the individual in question could be summoned to the bar of the House or Senate (or, {{in the case of a}} sitting member, to that member's place in the chamber) to be censured, and could also face other sanctions from the house, including imprisonment. Normally, censure is exclusively an on-the-record rebuke — it is not equivalent to a motion of no confidence, and a prime minister can continue in office even if censured.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, Section 1983 was {{of limited}} {{use for a}} state {{prisoner}} under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 {{as a vehicle for}} challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has narrowed the opportunity for relief <b>through</b> <b>Section</b> 1983.|$|E

2500|$|Certain {{provisions}} of the Constitution of Singapore are derived from the Malaysian Federal Constitution. This was effected <b>through</b> <b>section</b> 6(1) of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965, which states that the {{provisions of}} the Constitution of Malaysia, other than those set out in section 6(3) of the Act, [...] "shall continue in force in Singapore, subject to such modifications, adaptations and qualifications and exceptions as may be necessary to bring them into conformity with the independent status of Singapore upon separation from Malaysia". Notably, the fundamental liberties in Part II of the Federal Constitution were made applicable to Singapore. However, Article 13 of the Federal Constitution which concerns the right to property, was specifically omitted to ensure the constitutionality of the Land Acquisition Act 1966 which authorizes the Government to compulsorily acquire real estate.|$|E
2500|$|The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), {{under the}} Cabinet Secretariat, is {{responsible}} for co-ordinating and analysing intelligence activities between R, the Intelligence Bureau and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA). In practice, however, {{the effectiveness of the}} JIC has been varied. With the establishment of the National Security Council in 1999, the role of the JIC has been merged with the NSC. R's legal status is unusual, in that it is not an [...] "Agency", but a [...] "Wing" [...] of the Cabinet Secretariat. Hence, R is not answerable to the Parliament of India on any issue, which keeps it out of reach of the Right to Information Act.

The rights are enforceable by the courts <b>through</b> <b>section</b> 24 of the Charter, which allows courts discretion to award remedies to those whose rights have been denied. This section also allows courts to exclude evidence in trials if the evidence was acquired in a way that conflicts with the Charter and might damage the reputation of the justice system. Section 32 confirms that the Charter is binding on the federal government, the territories under its authority, and the provincial governments.|$|E

2500|$|When {{it comes}} to {{interpreting}} statutes, judges are expected {{to abide by the}} rules set out by the Legislature. On 26 February 1993, the Interpretation (Amendment) Act 1993 was passed to reform the law relating to statutory interpretation. The amending Act inserted section 9A into the Interpretation Act, which mandates that judges take a purposive approach to interpreting written law by requiring that an interpretation that promotes the purpose or object underlying the law be preferred to one that does not promote the purpose or object. In determining the meaning of a provision of written law, the court may consider extrinsic materials, that is, materials not forming part of the written law. Such materials include the speech made in Parliament by a minister during the Second Reading of a bill containing the provision, and other relevant material in any official record of Parliamentary debates. <b>Through</b> <b>section</b> 9A, Parliament requires judges to determine the meaning of written law by understanding the Parliamentary intention underlying the law and its purpose. Therefore, judges' freedom when {{it comes to}} statutory interpretation is somewhat restricted. However, it may be said that this deference to Parliament is [...] quintessential to uphold the certainty of law and to avoid defeating the Parliament's intention in enacting statutes.|$|E
2500|$|The NJDEP and St. Lawrence went on {{to appeal}} both of Orlofsky's rulings and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals {{subsequently}} reversed Orlofsky's second decision. [...] The appeals court ruled that Section 1983 {{could not be used}} in order to enforce a ruling regarding Title VI and that private action could not be taken by the citizens. [...] The final ruling in the case was that, while the NJDEP and St. Lawrence did violate Title VI, the decision could not be enforced <b>through</b> <b>Section</b> 1983. [...] The lawsuit delayed the opening of the St. Lawrence cement facility by two months, costing the company millions of dollars. In the years following the court case, members of the SCCA were able to raise awareness concerning environmental justice at higher levels than before; they were portrayed in a positive light by news coverage in major platforms such as The New York Times, Business Week, The National Law Journal, and The Philadelphia Inquirer, and garnered support from long-time civil rights activists and the NAACP. [...] The SCCA has engaged in several national events since the conclusion of South Camden, such as a press conference at the U.S. Senate, the Second National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights environmental justice hearings, all of which dealt with the advocacy of environmental justice.|$|E
