5|$|After {{the slow}} {{start to the}} season, Cancellara began to achieve success in June. He rode the Tour de Suisse and won the opening time trial, along with the final stage <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> a time trial. With the opening stage victory in the Tour de Suisse, Cancellara led the race for a few stages before losing it to {{teammate}} Fränk Schleck after stage four. Cancellara continued his success in the time trial with {{a victory in the}} Swiss national time trial.|$|E
5|$|An edition called OGRE: Deluxe Edition was {{released}} in 1987. The rulebook cover artwork was the Denis Loubet illustration <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> used for the Ogre computer game (see Spinoffs below). The board was sturdier than the previous edition's paper map, and the counters were provided with stand-up plastic bases. G.M. magazine's 1989 review of OGRE: Deluxe Edition highlighted the game's ease of introduction and short playing time, but pointed out that most gamers either like the game or loathe it.|$|E
5|$|Angelou was {{challenged}} by her friend, author James Baldwin, and her editor, Robert Loomis, {{to write an}} autobiography <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> a piece of literature. Reviewers often categorize Caged Bird as autobiographical fiction because Angelou uses thematic development and other techniques common to fiction, but the prevailing critical view characterizes it as an autobiography, a genre she attempts to critique, change, and expand. The book covers topics common to autobiographies written by Black American women {{in the years following}} the Civil Rights Movement: a celebration of Black motherhood; a critique of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition.|$|E

5|$|His non-selection in {{previous}} years was widely debated in the media. Bure was often compared with Cam Neely, a player who also waited six years for induction; he recorded similar goals-per-game numbers in a career <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> shortened to 700-plus games. It had been often rumoured that Pat Quinn, Bure's former head coach and general manager in Vancouver, who became co-chairman of the Hockey Hall of Fame's selection committee, opposed Bure's induction. However, {{in a conference call}} following his selection, Quinn was among the most prominent figures he thanked. Quinn criticized the Canucks organization for not yet retiring Bure's jersey.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the 48th Vanier Cup, played between Laval and McMaster at Rogers Centre in Toronto became {{both the}} most {{attended}} and most watched Vanier Cup ever. Held the same weekend {{and in the}} same city as the 100th Grey Cup, the game was attended by 37,098. The previous record was set in 1989 at the 25th Vanier Cup, when 32,847 watched the game between Western and Saskatchewan <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> played at SkyDome (now Rogers Centre). The game, broadcast on TSN and RDS was watched by 910,000.|$|E
5|$|In Mario Kart DS, a kart is able {{to draft}} behind another kart to gain a speed boost momentarily, a feature <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> {{previously}} used in the 1996 video game Mario Kart 64. Mario Kart DS places a stronger focus on the feature and once again provides a visual cue when a kart is drafting. In an interview, Konno notes that they included tracks from previous Mario Kart games into Mario Kart DS so that players who played the original Super Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System would feel {{more familiar with the}} DS iteration of the series.|$|E

5|$|Jones did not {{actively}} seek {{the position of}} Chief of the Air Staff before being appointed in 1942, and his conflict with Bostock—with whom he had been friends for 20years—was partly {{the result of a}} divided command structure, which neither man had any direct role in shaping. After World WarII, Jones had overall responsibility for transforming what was then the world's fourth largest air force into a peacetime service <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> able to meet overseas commitments in Malaya and Korea. Following his retirement from the RAAF, he continued to serve in the aircraft industry and later ran unsuccessfully for political office. He was knighted in 1953.|$|E

The squadron inherited all of No.3 Squadron's twelve MirageIII fighters {{and most of its}} personnel; the remainder of No.3 Squadron returned to Australia to be re-equipped with Hornets. As well as the Mirage IIIs, the squadron operated a single DHC-4 Caribou transport <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> based at Butterworth.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{subsequently}} oversaw a new reissue of {{the original}} album in 1998 on CD, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> remastered by Mew. This version contained an extra CD with three tracks {{that had been left}} off the 1993 set. The colour scheme of the cover was reversed to show gold text on a black background. The remastered Made in Japan has further edits to make a contiguous performance, making it shorter than the original release. At the same time, a limited edition of 4,000 double LPs was released on purple vinyl, while in Spain, EMI added the studio versions of the tracks making up the original album to the second CD.|$|E

This work occupied all but 250 of St. Leger's white men, with the actual encirclement of the fort dominated by Indians.|$|E

The E-10 MC2A would have included an all-new AWACS system, with a powerful active electronically scanned array (AESA) <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> capable of jamming enemy aircraft or missiles. One 767-400ER aircraft was produced as a testbed for systems integration, but the program was terminated in January 2009 and the prototype was sold to Bahrain as a VIP transport.|$|E

5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E
