On the other hand, the hypotheses intended to test behavioral differences regarding the level of membership types, affiliation of members to the community and whether they have adaptive behavior to the community were confirmed to a great extent.

40|$|Whilst recent {{literature}} on social networking theory {{has tended to}} concentrate on ‘brand communities’ (e. g. Cova et al., 2007) and off-line tribal behaviour (e. g. Moutinho et al., 2007), there is relatively sparse {{literature on}} online or internet based <b>tribal</b> <b>marketing</b> contexts using second generation web technologies. Drawing on the social psychology literature and in particular, the self and social identification and <b>tribal</b> <b>marketing</b> literature, this paper explores the concept of tribalism and <b>tribal</b> <b>marketing</b> within one such net based community. Machinima is the making of 3 D animated films using computerised games engines in real time. The term is derived {{from a combination of}} the words ‘machine’ and ‘cinema’ (Hancock and Ingram, 2007). The making of films using Machinima techniques requires artistic skill in development of storylines, scenes and scripts; a deep knowledge of computer games engines and often, an ability to engage in collaborations with other players in order to create works. Using a mixed method qualitative research design, this paper reports on a study which investigates the nature and characteristics of the ‘Machinima community’ and the reactions of its members to attempts by commercially motivated individuals and organisations to market products to it. Findings suggest the Machinima community exhibits many of the features of a tribal based community but in an on-line environment which is informed by the media and the message. Commercial organisations appear sensitive to the values of the community and their marketing activities may be described as both ‘covert and collusive’ insofar as tribal ‘leaders’ are involved in or recruited to help ‘co-develop tribal experiences’ through the development of software, which in turn can drive community evolution. Where this is successful, tribal members collaborate and become critical informants to the community. The implications of these findings suggest organisations will need to consider more subtle and sophisticated marketing activities within some e-contexts than have been used in more traditional offline contexts {{if they are to be}} successful...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an alternative, 'Latin', characterization of postmodernity. Here the urge {{is not to}} celebrate freedom from social constraints, but to re-establish social embeddedness. The citizen of postmodernity is less interested in the objects of consumption than in the social links and identities that come from them. This Latin view holds that people like to gather tohether in tribes and such social, proximate communities are more affective and influential on people's behaviour than either marketing institutions or other 'formal ' cultural authorities. There is also an element of resistance and reappropriation to the acts of being, gathering and experiencing together. This view of the shared experience of tribes sets it apart from both Northern notions of one-to-one relationship and atomistic markets. On this Latin view, the effective marketing of the postmodern era is not to accept and exploit consumers in their contemporary individualization, as Northern approaches might. Rather the future of marketing is in offering {{a renewed sense of}} community. Marketing becomes <b>tribal</b> <b>marketing.</b> In a marketing profession vigorously courtin...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work we perform an econometric {{analysis}} of the <b>Tribal</b> art <b>market.</b> To this aim, we use a unique and original database that includes information on <b>Tribal</b> art <b>market</b> auctions worldwide from 1998 to 2011. In Literature, art prices are modelled through the hedonic regression model, a classic fixed-effect model. The main drawback of the hedonic approach is {{the large number of}} parameters, since, in general, art data include many categorical variables. In this work, we propose a multilevel model for the analysis of Tribal art prices that takes into account the influence of time on artwork prices. In fact, it is natural to assume that time exerts an influence over the price dynamics in various ways. Nevertheless, since the set of objects change at every auction date, we do not have repeated measurements of the same items over time. Hence, the dataset does not constitute a proper panel; rather, it has a two-level structure in that items, level- 1 units, are grouped in time points, level- 2 units. The main theoretical contribution is the extension of classical multilevel models to cope with the case described above. In particular, we introduce a model with time dependent random effects at the second level. We propose a novel specification of the model, derive the maximum likelihood estimators and implement them through the E-M algorithm. We test the finite sample properties of the estimators and the validity of the own-written R-code by means of a simulation study. Finally, we show that the new model improves considerably the fit of the Tribal art data with respect to both the hedonic regression model and the classic multilevel model...|$|R

40|$|About the book: Marketing and {{consumer}} research has traditionally conceptualized consumers as individuals- who exercise {{choice in the}} marketplace as individuals not as a class or a group. However an important new perspective is now emerging that rejects the individualistic view and focuses on the reality that human life is essentially social, and that who we are is an inherently social phenomenon.

The social ?links?

The case studies provide geographical and situational examples on how the changing <b>tribal</b> gaming <b>market</b> is reshaping and redefining the boundaries of sovereignty on and off of tribal lands and non-tribal lands. Each case study provides a detailed history of the tribe and their gaming experiences. Through {{the use of a}} cultural site analysis, each tribe’s on and off-reservation gaming facilities were examined to measure the economic and cultural impacts that they have on their surrounding communities. By measuring the economic impact that the tribes have on states, surrounding communities, their reservations, and individual tribal members, each case study provides a unique look at the <b>tribal</b> gaming <b>market.</b> The case studies also provide insight into how tribes are using gaming revenue for tribal services and individual benefits, how this revenue helps to create public perceptions about tribal and Indian identities, and how this revenue influences tribal policies. 	Each case study shows that tribes face a number of new economic, political, and social problems when they venture off of tribal land for gaming purposes. The results shows that off-reservation forms of gaming are creating numerous economic opportunities for tribes, surrounding communities, and state through the creation of new jobs, taxes generated, and increases in tourism. The results also show an increase for tribes to provide social services and other benefits to tribal members. The results show that with every gaming situation, new and unforeseeable economic and cultural problems develop as the result of tribal gaming. Tribal gaming can be an effective way for tribes to generate revenue and create a self-sustainable economic industry both on and off-reservation lands if tribe prepare themselves for the rigors and unforeseeable problems associated with the industry. Tribal gaming will continue to adapt {{to meet the needs of}} a changing industry and the more tribes prepare, the more they can venture into new territories.

It is imperative to understand this process and study the nature of the impact on various communities. It is making its impact even on developed countries. The impact is social, economic, political, cultural and even moral in nature. The reform process began in India in 1991. As Streeten points out, it increases the gap between different strata of people and countries. Globalization is good for rich people and developed countries with assets and skills. But it is bad for the developing countries and poor people like Tribals and Dalits. The studies included are the Hill Tribes of Chamarajanagara District and Nayaka Community in H. D Kote, Mysore district. The study is based on the secondary data. The selected research design is Descriptive-cum-diagnostic research design. The study shows that Globalization affects tribals differently. Urban and educated tribals may benefit from the increased opportunities for work. The new technologies that define this era, in particular the computer and internet may be accessible to this group of <b>tribals.</b> <b>Markets</b> are not very friendly to the poor, to the weak or to the vulnerable, either nationally or internationally. The result shows that the hill tribes Jenu Kurubas and Kadu kurub are illiterate and their living standard is Below Poverty Line (BPL). It was found that the major problems are lack of awareness and ability to access to public offices. And the Nayaka of H. D. Kote taluk who are totally dependent on the fuel wood collection and selling them to the local public, hotels, bakery etc, for their survival. It also reflects their socioeconomic condition. In conclusion the tribals are part of the Indian society, {{at the same time they}} are different. Special policy and programmes are required to address and redress these differences especially in the context of globalization. Outsiders cannot develop tribals; they can become only facilitators if they want to do so. Their felt needs should be transformed in development programmes. The tribals can participate in their development programmes only if they are considered to be equals and if unique identities are respected...|$|R

Gum gellan, a microbial heteropolysaccharide, was employed for similar {{purpose in the}} case of gold nanoparticles [6]. Gum ghatti is a naturally occurring water soluble, complex polysaccharide derived as an exudate from the bark of Anogeissus latifolia (Combretaceae family), a native tree of the Indian sub-continent. The name gum ghatti has originated from its transportation through mountain passes or ghats. This native Indian gum is collected from the forests by the <b>tribals</b> and <b>marketed</b> through government organizations such as Girijan Co-operative Corporation Ltd., Visakhapatnam, India. The world production of gum ghatti is about 1, 000 – 1, 500 MT/year [7, 8]. This biopolymer is an arabinogalactan type of natural gum and its morphological, structural, physico-chemical, compositional, solution, thermal, rheological, and emulsifying properties have been well documented and studied [9 – 17]. This biopolymer is a high-arabinose, protein rich, acidic heteropolysaccharide, occurring in nature as mixed calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salt [12 – 14, 16]. The primary structure of this gum is composed of sugars such as, l-arabinose, d-galactose, d-mannose, d-xylose, and d-glucuronic acid in a molar ratio of 48 : 29 : 10 : 5 : 10 and < 1 % of rhamnose, which is present as non-reducing end-groups. The gum contains alternating 4 -O- substituted and 2 -O-substituted α d-mannopyranose units and chains of 1 → 6 linked β d-galactopyranose units with side chains of l-arabinofuranose residues. Six percent of rhamnose in the polysaccharide is linked to the galactose backbone as α-Rhap-(1 → 4) β-galactopyranose side chain. It has a molecular weight of 8.94 × 107 g/mol [12, 13, 15, 16].|$|R

Specifically, issues of business diversification, marketing, perceived barriers to success, potential benefits to the tribe, and the role of agriculture in the preservation of tribal heritage were considered. A modified mixed-methods exploratory sequential research model was used to collect and organize data in two phases. Phase 1 quantitative data was used to inform the development of a Phase 2 qualitative interview protocol. Phase 1 found a significant relationship between a higher income level and a lower perception of barriers to entry into the wine industry for tribal entities. Additionally, respondents with an acculturation rating of Bicultural were found to have a higher perception of barriers to entry into the wine industry than those rated as Assimilated. In relation to <b>marketing</b> <b>tribal</b> winery products, the safest categories for marketing consideration were geography, animals, and tribal writing. Ceremonial dress and historic figures were rated as neutral, and totems were rated as unacceptable. Finally, perceived viability of a tribally operated winery in respondents’ own tribe and the perceived viability of a tribally operated winery in tribes other than respondents were compared to respondents’ average perception of barriers and benefits. A significant positive relationship was found between respondents’ perceived viability of a winery within their own tribe and their perception of the benefits a winery could offer. A significant negative relationship was found between respondents’ perceived viability of a winery within their own tribe and their perception of the barriers to inception. For tribes other than respondents’ own, a higher perceived viability of a winery had a significant positive relationship with the perception of the benefits to winery operation.
