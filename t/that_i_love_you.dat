[...] At 10 AM on 9 May 1915 Cros' brigade advanced in conjunction with the division's 1st Brigade, a French Foreign Legion unit led by Colonel Pein. [...] The five-hour preliminary bombardment was largely ineffective and the division took heavy casualties in reaching the German lines, [...] distant. [...] However they managed to push the Germans out and some units even reached the villages of Vimy and Givenchy-en-Gohelle. [...] The next morning, hit by their own artillery and under German counter-attack, the French were forced to withdraw to their own lines in the course of which Cros was killed. [...] Cros was one of almost 2,000 men of the Moroccan division killed in that action, as was fellow brigade commander Colonel Pein.|$|E
