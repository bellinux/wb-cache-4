5|$|Ginko {{receives}} a letter requesting his presence from Tanyu, a woman infected with a Mushi that demands her <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> Mushi to expel it. On the way, he meets Koro, a Mushishi {{who is trying}} to capture a rainbow-like Mushi. They go to the house of Tanyu, where her nanny, Tama, says that a white-haired woman told them about the Tokoyami. When Tanyu tried <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> it, she was afflicted by paralysis and gangrene. Ginko then asks to read about the Tokoyami; while he is reading, the Tokoyami from the writings leave them and return to Tanyu, further exacerbating her condition.|$|E
5|$|After the book's publication, Szalavitz {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> {{the controversy}} surrounding the troubled-teen industry for Statistical Assessment Service, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Reason, and The American Prospect. The House Committee on Education and Labor held additional hearings on the matter on April 24, 2008, again chaired by Representative George Miller.|$|E

Two years later, he had a master's degree from the University of Chicago. In 1959 he finished his doctoral degree at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He retired from Purdue University, was appointed Professor Emeritus, and lived in Canberra, Australia, where he continued <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Havelock {{moved away}} from the socialist organisations he had been {{associated}} with, and in 1944 was elected founding president of the Ontario Classical Association. One of the association's first activities was organising a relief effort for Greece, which had just been liberated from Nazi control. Havelock continued <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> politics, however, and his political and academic work came together in his ideas about education; he argued for the necessity of an understanding of rhetoric for the resistance to corporate persuasiveness.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh wrote a great deal. One of the main themes during this time was the {{proclamation}} of his claimed mission; he instructed some of his followers to take his claims to Bábís in Iran and Iraq who had not heard of his statements, as well as asking the Bahá'ís to be united and detached from the world. He also started <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> distinctive Bahá'í beliefs and practices.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression Flanders began <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> social policy. His {{major concern}} was human {{development}} in a technological era. He addressed employing spiritual guidance with a “program of human values” to achieve a good life. Nevertheless, his underlying goal was to achieve “full employment.” So, he kept himself grounded in economic principles, as understood and debated during that era.|$|E

5|$|England won {{the final}} match by one wicket, but lost the series 2–1. While {{contemporary}} critics did not blame MacLaren, the cricket authorities were less happy. MacLaren {{believed that the}} choices of the selectors had {{made it impossible to}} win, and continued <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> the series for many years. He finished the series with 198 runs at 28.28, and ended the season with 1,254 first-class runs at 32.15.|$|E
5|$|In 1785, he {{was asked}} by the cabildo (town council) <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> smallpox, the worst medical problem the Audiencia faced. Espejo used the {{opportunity}} to write his most complete and best-written work, Reflexiones acerca de un método para preservar a los pueblos de las viruelas (Reflections about a method to preserve the people from smallpox), denouncing the way the Audiencia handled sanitation. This work is a valuable historical source as a description of the hygienic and sanitary conditions of colonial America.|$|E
5|$|The {{first people}} <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> the May Revolution were {{participants}} who wrote memoirs, biographies and diaries. However, their works {{were motivated by}} purposes other than historiographic ones, such as to explain {{the reasons for their}} actions, clean their public images, or express their support or rejection of the public figures and ideas of the time. For example, Manuel Moreno wrote the biography of his brother Mariano as propaganda for the revolutions in Europe, and Cornelio Saavedra wrote his autobiography at a moment when his image was highly questioned, to justify himself to his sons.|$|E

5|$|A {{native of}} San Luis Potosí, Blancornelas {{began his career}} as a {{journalist}} for El Sol de San Luis in April 1955, working as a sportswriter. In 1960, he moved to Tijuana, Baja California, where he became active in reporting on corruption and the drug trade. He was promoted to news editor at the daily newspaper El Mexicano before moving to the daily La Voz de la Frontera, of which he became editor-in-chief. Unlike several other journalists during his time, Blancornelas was eager <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> drug trafficking and corruption, leading to his firing from three newspapers before deciding to create his own.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of publication, Vachss worked as an attorney, in New York City, specializing in child abuse cases; {{he also had a}} career as a novelist. The duality of Vachss' work as a lawyer prosecuting and {{defending}} real cases and as a crime fiction author writing about fictional criminals resulted in Vachss being compared to the Bruce Wayne/Batman character. Vachss' eighth novel, Footsteps of the Hawk, in the Burke series featuring a vigilante private investigator of child abuse cases, was released just two months before the publication of Batman: The Ultimate Evil. He had wanted to approach the topic of sex tourism in southeast Asia, but had been unable to find a way for the Burke character to go there; the Batman character offered the chance for him <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> the topic.|$|E
5|$|Coolsma {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> both {{missionary work}} and the Sundanese language. In 1881, he wrote a series of condemnatory reviews of Sundanese-language schoolbooks offered by the colonial government, arguing that the content had little value and the language was mostly artificial. He published a Sundanese-Dutch dictionary in 1884, consulting various works of Sundanese literature for his lexemes. In 1901, he published {{a history of the}} mission in the East Indies, titled De zendingseeuw voor Nederlandsche Oost-Indiës (The Century of the Mission in the Dutch East Indies). It described the 19th century as time of extensive growth.|$|E

ISBN: 9780226526317. The Chicago Guide <b>to</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>about</b> Numbers is a {{reference}} work suitable for {{anyone interested in}} understanding, using, or promoting quantitative thinking. Its primary aim is to identify and illustrate ways in which information associated with numbers can be conveyed most effectively given a particular communication purpose and context. The book is directed at writers who incorporate numbers in verbal or visual displays in documents, in oral presentations, or on the Web. The Chicago Guide <b>to</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>about</b> Numbers identifies overarching principles, offers concrete advice, and presents illuminating examples and models. The book {{can be used for}} instructional purposes for undergraduates, and a means of doing so is described. The review concludes by considering the book’s contributions to a wider call <b>to</b> help citizens <b>write</b> or argue more effectively by using numbers...|$|R

5|$|James Maurice Kilburn (8 July 1909 – 28 August 1993) was a British sports {{journalist}} who {{wrote for the}} Yorkshire Post between 1934 and 1976. Well-regarded for the style of his writing and his refusal <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> off-field events, Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club. After a brief career in teaching, and having spent time in Finland, Kilburn was appointed cricket correspondent at the Yorkshire Post after impressing the editor with his writing. A serious man, he had an unusual way of writing his reports, but his editors refused to change his copy, so highly did they value his impact.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Reed, who {{was trying}} to get home, was unable to get State Department {{clearance}} for a visa and was detained in Oslo (then called Christiana), Norway, for more than a month. His letters were censored, and Bryant did not hear from him directly until April. On orders from Edgar Sisson of the U.S. Commission on Public Information, all of Reed's papers were confiscated when he arrived in New York on April 28. Unable <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> the October Revolution without his notes, Reed instead gave speeches advocating U.S. recognition of the new Russian government. That summer, the couple retreated to Croton-on-Hudson.|$|E
5|$|Smashed was {{conceived}} by James Ponsoldt and Susan Burke {{after they had}} a conversation about things they had done while drunk. Some of the story's details were based on Burke's own experience; she was an alcoholic until she was 24 years old, when she started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Burke felt that her experiences with alcoholism had not been represented on film before, and so she decided <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> a young woman deciding to become sober. Burke and Ponsoldt discussed the story, characters and tone in detail before they began to write the script. Since they lived {{on opposite sides of}} the United States, they communicated by email, dividing the script into 15-page installments which they wrote alternately. The entire writing process took six months.|$|E
50|$|Un Viaje is an 1840 book {{on travel}} and customs by Felipe Pardo y Aliaga. Pardo y Aliaga's travel {{writings}} introduced the satirical travel and customs genre <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> the Andes.|$|R

5000|$|...After 1823, Leopardi {{abandoned}} the myths and illustrious {{figures of the}} past, which he now considered to be transformed into meaningless symbols and turned <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> suffering in a more [...] "cosmic" [...] sense.|$|R
5|$|Sorkin came up {{with the}} idea <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> the behind-the-scenes happenings on a sports show while he was living in a room in the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles writing the {{screenplay}} for The American President. He would work late, with the TV tuned into ESPN, watching continuous replays of SportsCenter. The show inspired him to try to write a feature film about a sports show but he was unable to structure the story for film, so instead he turned his idea into a TV comedy series. Sports Night was produced by Disney and debuted on the Disney-owned ABC network in the fall of 1998.|$|E
5|$|Vanilla Ice took an {{interest}} in the musical style found on Hard to Swallow while performing {{as a member of a}} Miami grunge band, and was able to develop this sound through a friendship with producer Ross Robinson, with whom he shared {{an interest}} in motocross racing. Robinson produced the album after being advised against working with Vanilla Ice. The album's darker lyrical subject matter developed from conversations, in which Robinson encouraged him <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> his past. Subjects included Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood, drug addiction and struggles with fame. While the album revived Vanilla Ice's career, it received largely negative reviews and did not chart.|$|E
5|$|White {{said that}} The Troubles in Northern Ireland induced him <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> {{the sort of}} world {{he would like to}} live in, and that he disliked war and militarists. As a youth he wanted to become a doctor, but had to go out to work. Hence he relied on {{epidemics}} and natural disasters to provide the conflicts that stories need to make them interesting. He credited his wife, who was an intensive care nurse at the height of The Troubles, for advice on medical details and for pointing out how padres often did more good than doctors for disturbed patients, which inspired The Genocidal Healer.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> law and business, Ackman has <b>written</b> extensively <b>about</b> off-beat {{sporting events}} such as ping pong, outrigger canoe racing, Ivy League wrestling, the Army Best Ranger competition, squash, the world cyber-games World Cyber Games, and white collar boxing Gleason's gym.|$|R
