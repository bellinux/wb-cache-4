25|$|The {{influence}} of British newspapers on creating {{the public perception}} of mods as having a leisure-filled club-going lifestyle {{can be seen in}} a 1964 article in the Sunday Times. The paper interviewed a 17-year-old mod who went out clubbing seven nights a week and spent Saturday afternoons shopping for clothes and records. However, few British teens and young adults would have had <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> to spend this much time going to nightclubs. Paul Jobling and David Crowley argue that most young mods worked 9 to 5 at semi-skilled jobs, which meant that they had much less leisure time and only a modest income to spend during their time off.|$|E
25|$|Society changed {{quickly after}} World War I. For example, customs, technology, and {{manufacturing}} all moved {{quickly into the}} 20th century after the interruption of the war. The rise of the automobile was {{an important factor in}} flapper culture, as cars meant a woman could come and go as she pleased, travel to speakeasies and other entertainment venues, and use the large vehicles of the day for their popular activity, petting parties. Also, the economic boom allowed more people <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> to play golf and tennis and to take vacations, which required clothing adapted to these activities; the flapper's slender silhouette was very suitable for movement.|$|E
25|$|In one of {{the many}} Manhattan {{properties}} that Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and her husband owned, Gertrude Whitney established the Whitney Studio Club at 8 West 8th Street in 1914, as a facility where young artists could exhibit their works. By the 1930s it had evolved into her greatest legacy, the Whitney Museum of American Art, on the site of today's New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture. The Whitney was founded in 1931, as an answer to the Museum of Modern Art, founded 1928, and its collection of mostly European modernism and its neglect of American Art. Gertrude Whitney decided to put <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> into the museum after the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art turned down her offer to contribute her twenty-five-year collection of modern art works. In 1936, the renowned Abstract Expressionist artist and teacher Hans Hofmann moved his art school from E. 57th Street to 52 West 9th Street. In 1938, Hofmann moved again to a more permanent home at 52 West 8th Street. The school remained active until 1958 when Hofmann retired from teaching.|$|E

25|$|Special costume: traditionally, {{the costumes}} of acolytes, footmen, {{ceremonial}} guards, or slaves help {{show off the}} wealth of the person staging a procession. An ornate example was the embroidered train of George IV of the United Kingdom, carried at his coronation by nine lords in waiting with their own matching silken clothes, capes, ruffs, and plumed hats. Other examples include the Swiss Guard and high vestments of the Pope. The formal, matching clothes of bridesmaids and groomsmen are in the same tradition, although sometimes purchased at the attendant's expense rather than by the people honored in the ceremony. In egalitarian times and places, whoever has taken <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> to put together something impressive may appear in a parade; such costumes are of course the focal point of Halloween parades such as that staged in Greenwich Village, New York. Finally, processions may be staged simply to show off the costumes as one part of a larger event, such as at fashion pageants, military reenactments, pop concerts, or Renaissance Festivals.|$|E
25|$|In January 2007, State Senator John Bonacic of Mount Hope began {{drafting}} {{legislation to}} halt the planned transfer of maintenance of I-84. Bonacic asserted that the Thruway Authority had better maintenance practices than NYSDOT, most notably {{in the field of}} snow removal. He also claimed that the DOT lacked <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> needed to match the quality of maintenance that NYSTA performed on I-84. The senator eventually prevailed as the 2007–2008 budget was modified to allocate additional funding to NYSDOT, which would then pay the Thruway Authority to maintain I-84. A formal agreement between the two agencies was reached on September19. The one-year agreement cost NYSDOT $11.5million and took effect October30, the date I-84 was to become DOT-maintained. The agreement was renewed in April 2008 at a cost of $10.3million, extending the arrangement through October31, 2009. It remained in place until October11, 2010, when NYSDOT re-assumed maintenance of the highway. The change was made in the 2010–2011 state budget in an effort to reduce the cost of maintaining I-84. Governor David Paterson—who included the change in the budget—expected that the state would save $3.9million annually on maintenance costs.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} factors that promote {{circular}} migration. Modern forms of transport and communication, increased social networks, {{and the growth}} of international corporations all contribute to the growing phenomena. Advances in transportation have reduced <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> necessary to travel between locations, making it easier for migrants to return home more frequently {{and in the case of}} an emergency. New methods of communication facilitate closer connections with the migrants’ homes than before. Border-crossing social networks are especially important to the success of migrants. Through these networks, migrants are able to help each other by providing information about where to go, the best way to get jobs, where to live, etc., helping them to overcome many of the costs and barriers of entry. Furthermore, through these social networks, workers are able to keep up with families, economic activities, political interests, and individual cultures. This also contributes to the self-perpetuating nature of circular migration. With each return visit, migrants learn more about work, housing, and the process of migration itself. These social relationships and experiences, referred to as “migration-specific capital”, lower the risk and costs of moving and improve the changes of success.|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} {{illusion}} of the parallel Earth – apparent in images such as reversed text – both quickly and cheaply, the production staff inverted the film negatives using an optical process known as [...] "flop-over". This technique saved <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> that would otherwise needed to have been spent in building sets and props with specially reversed elements, or organising road closures to film cars driving on the [...] "wrong" [...] side of the road. However, the scenes set in or around the parallel EUROSEC Headquarters required careful rehearsal and co-ordination with cast and crew prior to filming. The incorporation of the flop-over technique results in some continuity errors: for example, the terminals of the Heart Lung Kidney machines onboard Phoenix are seen to be connected first to Ross and Kane's left wrists, then their right.|$|E
500|$|Mitchell-Innes {{was named}} {{as one of}} three captains of Somerset in 1948.

There was no obvious replacement for Meyer; like many counties Somerset would not consider having a professional captain, and finding an amateur with <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> to lead the side was proving troublesome.

They get more than they bargained for, however, as they {{come face to face with}} Russian mercenaries also after the artifact. The film, a Canadian-Chinese production, was shot on location in Inner Mongolia. Later in 2007, Lundgren wrote, {{directed and}} starred in Missionary Man alongside Charles Solomon Jr.. Described as a [...] "modern western" [...] by Lundgren, He plays a lone, Bible-preaching stranger named Ryder who comes into a small Texas town on his 1970's Harley-Davidson motorcycle to attend the funeral of his good friend J.J., a local Native American carpenter, only to later get mixed up in a series of brawls with a local gang. According to Lundgren, it had long been a desire of his to direct a western, having long been a fan of Clint Eastwood and John Wayne, yet he did not want to spend <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> building an old western town and hiring horses, so decided to set it in modern times with a motorbike instead of entering the town on a horse in the manner than Clint Eastwood would. Lundgren's co-writer, Frank Valdez's wife's brother happened to be a notable actor working in Texas and invited Lundgren's team to shoot there. The film was shot on location in Waxahachie, a southern suburb of Dallas and was produced by Andrew Stevens and it was specially screened at the 2008 AFI Dallas Film Festival.|$|E
500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the war, county cricket resumed in 1946, during which year Seamer played two matches with little success. He did not appear in first-class cricket in 1947, but was named as one of three captains of Somerset in 1948. Jack Meyer had reluctantly captained the side in 1947, but stepped {{down at the end of}} the season: he was having problems with his sight, and required daily painkillers for lumbago.

In his history of Somerset County Cricket Club, Peter Roebuck describes the situation as a [...] "remarkable state of affairs", while David Foot suggests that the true number of captains was closer to seven. During his time as captain, Seamer carried an old train board saying [...] "To Tonbridge" [...] in his cricket bag, claiming that it brought good luck to the team. In the eleven matches that Somerset played under his captaincy though, only one resulted in a victory. Seamer claimed that some of his best friends at the club were among the professionals, who he praised for their team spirit, despite the strained leadership changes. His friendship with the professionals was in contrast to the attitudes of both the club's committee, and its captain for the previous season. Meyer had been unpopular with the professionals due to his attitude to the game, and the manner in which he utilised them, while the club's committee felt that the professional players deserved little recognition when successful, claiming that this was what they were paid for. Seamer's batting was no longer strong enough to support his inclusion in the team, and he played low in the middle order. He failed to reach double figures in any of his first seven innings that season, but recorded a half-century against Kent in his final match for Somerset, his first since 1936 in first-class cricket.|$|E
