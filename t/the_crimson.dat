5|$|With {{their victory}} over Georgia in the SEC Championship Game, Alabama {{qualified}} for the 2013 BCS National Championship Game, and against Notre Dame <b>the</b> <b>Crimson</b> Tide captured their third BCS Championship in four years with a 42–14 victory over the Fighting Irish. After Notre Dame won the coin toss and elected to defer until the second half, Alabama took their opening possession 82 yards in five plays and Eddie Lacy gave <b>the</b> <b>Crimson</b> Tide an early 7–0 lead with his 20-yard touchdown run. On the first Irish possession that followed, <b>the</b> <b>Crimson</b> Tide held them to a three-and-out and forced a punt. The kick was subsequently fumbled by Christion Jones and recovered by Notre Dame; however, a kick catching interference penalty was called against the Irish and gave back possession to Alabama. On the drive that ensued, <b>the</b> <b>Crimson</b> Tide took a 14–0 lead when AJ McCarron threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Michael Williams that capped a 10-play, 61-yard drive.

5|$|After Bryant retired, Ray Perkins {{extended}} Alabama's consecutive {{bowl game}} streak to 25 {{years with a}} victory in the 1983 Sun Bowl. However, the streak ended when the 1984 team finished the season with a record of five wins and six losses and failed to qualify for a bowl {{for the first time in}} 26 years. The bowl absence lasted only one season as Perkins led <b>the</b> <b>Crimson</b> Tide to wins in both the Aloha and Sun Bowls before he resigned as head coach following the 1986 season. Bill Curry continued the bowl tradition and led <b>the</b> <b>Crimson</b> Tide to Hall of Fame, Sun and Sugar Bowl appearances in his three seasons as head coach. After Curry, Gene Stallings took Alabama to the Fiesta, Blockbuster, Gator, Citrus and Outback Bowls. Stallings also led <b>the</b> <b>Crimson</b> Tide to victory in the first Bowl Coalition national championship game with a 34–13 victory over Miami in the Sugar Bowl.

A seven-yard Eddie Lacy touchdown run completed an 11-play, 92-yard drive and gave <b>the</b> <b>Crimson</b> Tide a 7–3 lead. On the LSU possession that ensued, the Alabama defense held the Tigers to a three-and-out. However, Cyrus Jones fumbled the Brad Wing punt that was recovered by LSU at <b>the</b> <b>Crimson</b> Tide 36-yard line. LSU then failed to capitalize on the turnover as Alleman was tackled for a two-yard loss on a fake field goal attempt and gave Alabama possession at their 33-yard-line. After another Alabama punt and a missed 54-yard Alleman field goal, <b>the</b> <b>Crimson</b> Tide took a 14–3 halftime lead on a nine-yard McCarron touchdown run with only 0:11 left in the half.|$|E

On their next possession, Yeldon scored on a one-yard touchdown run that extended Alabama's lead to 31–17. Odell Beckham Jr. then returned the kickoff that ensued 82-yards to <b>the</b> <b>Crimson</b> Tide 18-yard line. However, the offense was unable {{to capitalize on the}} good field position as the Alabama defense forced a turnover on downs. <b>The</b> <b>Crimson</b> Tide then drove 78 yards in eight plays, capping the drive with a three-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Jalston Fowler that made the score 38–17.
