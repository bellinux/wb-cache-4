5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E
500|$|Within {{two years}} of the Stonewall riots there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe. People who joined activist {{organizations}} after the riots had very little in common other than their same-sex attraction. Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one place. Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots. This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after Barbara Gittings exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist Jean O'Leary protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by cross-dressers and drag queens in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, Sylvia Rivera and Lee Brewster jumped on the stage and shouted [...] "You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and these bitches <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> quit being ourselves!" [...] Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust.|$|E

2500|$|The band made a demo tape but, {{instead of}} mailing {{the tape to}} record companies, they would go in and {{personally}} deliver it. They would demand the companies play it; according to Dave Gahan, [...] "most of them would <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> fuck off. They'd say 'leave the tape with us' and we'd say 'it's our only one'. Then we'd say goodbye and go somewhere else." ...|$|E

"t {{seems that}} the world is conspiring in preaching that there is {{something}} wrong with Kenyan ladies' kinky hair and dark skin Their leaflets are all about skin lightening, and they seem to be doing good business in Kenya. It just shocks me. It's not OK for a Caucasian to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> lighten our skin [...] I have never attempted to change my skin. I am natural. People in Europe and America love my dark skin. But here in Kenya, in my home country, some consider it not attractive." ...|$|E

Moreover, the land {{on both sides of the}} Yalu River is also within our borders, but the Jurchens have now stolen it....

2500|$|It was a {{difficult}} shoot for Campbell who had to learn elaborate choreography for the battle scenes, which involved him remembering a number system because the actor was often fighting opponents that were not really there. Mesa remembers, [...] "Bruce was cussing and swearing {{some of the time}} because you had to work on the number system. Sam would <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> make it as complicated and hard for Bruce as possible. 'Make him go through torture!' So we'd come up with these shots that were really, really difficult, and sometimes they would take thirty-seven takes". Some scenes, like Evil Ash walking along the graveyard while his skeleton minions come to life, blended stop-motion animation with live skeletons that were mechanically rigged, with prosthetics and visual effects.|$|E
