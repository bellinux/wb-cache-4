5|$|City gained {{their first}} honours {{by winning the}} Second Division in 1899; with it came {{promotion}} {{to the highest level}} in English football, the First Division. They went on to claim their first major honour on 23 April 1904, beating Bolton Wanderers 1–0 at Crystal Palace to win the FA Cup; City narrowly missed out on a League and Cup double that season after finishing runners-up in the League but City became the first club in Manchester <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> honour.|$|E
5|$|In 2003–04, Brulé {{joined the}} Giants and tallied 60points in 67games. He {{became the first}} Giants player <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> WHL award, {{receiving}} the Jim Piggott Memorial Trophy as league {{rookie of the year}}. The distinction made him a nominee for Canadian Hockey League (CHL) Rookie of the Year, which went to Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) rookie of the year Sidney Crosby of the Rimouski Océanic. He joined Crosby on the CHL All-Rookie Team.|$|E
5|$|Rodgers {{led them}} in the 2013–14 season to a {{surprise}} title challenge, however Liverpool ended the league season in second place, despite scoring 101 goals scored, the club's most since the 1895–96 season and the third-highest in Premier League history. Rodgers was the first Liverpool manager to win the LMA Manager of The Year Award. However, {{he was the first}} manager of the club not <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> trophy in his first three years at the helm, and on 4 October 2015, he was sacked. On 8 October, he was replaced by former Borussia Dortmund manager Jürgen Klopp.|$|E
5|$|Bolton Wanderers {{have not}} <b>won</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> trophy since 1958, when two Lofthouse goals saw them {{overcome}} Manchester United in the FA Cup final {{in front of}} a 100,000 crowd at Wembley Stadium. The closest they have come <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> trophy since then is finishing runners-up in the League Cup, first in 1995 and again in 2004.|$|R

5000|$|Olimpija Ljubljana had {{won four}} Slovenian Championships, four Slovenian Cups and one Slovenian Supercup {{in the period}} between the country's {{independence}} from Yugoslavia in 1991 until the club's dissolution in 2004. Although the club had spent 22 seasons in top flight during the SFR Yugoslavia period (1945-1991), the club never won any silverware and the closest they came <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> domestic trophy was reaching the 1970 Yugoslav Cup final.|$|R
5|$|Woods {{had a much}} {{anticipated}} {{return to}} golf in 2009, when he performed well. His comeback included a spectacular performance at the 2009 Presidents Cup, but he failed <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> <b>major,</b> the first year since 2004 {{that he had not}} done so. After his marital infidelities came to light and received massive media coverage at the end of 2009 (see further details below), Woods announced in December that he would be taking an indefinite break from competitive golf. In February 2010, he delivered a televised apology for his behavior. During this period, several companies ended their endorsement deals with Woods.|$|E
5|$|Gil Merrick was {{the first}} Birmingham manager <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> trophy, the League Cup in 1963. Merrick also led the club to the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final in 1961, {{following}} Pat Beasley who {{had done the same}} in 1960. Leslie Knighton took the club to the final of the FA Cup in 1931; Arthur Turner did likewise in 1956, as well as taking charge of the club's highest league finish, sixth place in the 1955–56 First Division. Birmingham reached the 2001 Football League Cup Final under Trevor Francis, whose successor as permanent manager, Steve Bruce, twice achieved promotion to the Premier League. Birmingham won the League Cup for the second time under Alex McLeish in 2011. The 1966 World Cup-winning manager, Sir Alf Ramsey, took charge of the club briefly in 1977.|$|E
5|$|In July 2000, Florentino Pérez {{was elected}} club president. He vowed in his {{campaign}} to erase the club's €270million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona. The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro. It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> trophy {{for the next three}} seasons.|$|E
50|$|Tseng {{entered the}} LPGA Qualifying Tournament {{in the fall}} of 2007 and {{finished}} sixth in the final Qualifying Tournament in December which gave Tseng full playing privileges on the LPGA Tour for 2008. In June 2008, she claimed her first LPGA tour victory at the LPGA Championship to become the first player from Taiwan <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>an</b> LPGA <b>major</b> championship.

5|$|In the 1999–2000 season, Hašek was {{hampered}} by a nagging groin injury. He missed forty games and failed <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> NHL {{award for the}} first time in several years. Though he healed in time for the playoffs, the Sabres were eliminated in the first round in five games by the Philadelphia Flyers. In 2000–01—his final season with Buffalo—Hašek set a modern era record by collecting his sixth Vezina Trophy. He also won his second William M. Jennings Trophy. The Sabres played Philadelphia in the first round of the playoffs again, where Hašek outplayed his 1998 Olympic back-up Roman Čechmánek. In the clinching sixth game, Hašek recorded a shutout against the Flyers. In the second round, the Sabres played a seven-game series against Mario Lemieux's Pittsburgh Penguins, which culminated with the Penguins winning the final game in overtime.|$|E
5|$|The next {{significant}} {{manager of}} Bristol Rovers was Albert Prince-Cox, who introduced blue-and-white quarters as the team's kit {{because he believed}} it made the players look larger and more intimidating. He also became the first manager <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> cup competition with the club when they won the Division 3 (South) Cup in 1935. More success followed in the 1952–53 season when Bristol Rovers' longest serving post-war manager, Bert Tann, won a league title {{for the first time}} since 1905 and won promotion for the first time ever when the club won Division 3 (South). Tann remained in charge for eighteen years from 1950 to 1968.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{played in}} the Hopman Cup and Australian Open in January 2017. At the Australian Open, he beat top-10 players Tomáš Berdych and Kei Nishikori to reach the quarterfinals, where he beat Mischa Zverev, making Federer the oldest man {{to compete in a}} grand slam semi-final since Jimmy Connors in 1991. In the semi-finals, he {{defeated}} Stanislas Wawrinka in five sets, making him the oldest player to compete in a Grand Slam final since Ken Rosewall in 1974. Coming back from a break down in the fifth set, Federer defeated Rafael Nadal to win the Australian Open, which also marked Federer's 100th match at the Australian Open; {{it was the first time}} Federer had won a match against Nadal in a Grand Slam event since the 2007 Wimbledon final, and also marked Federer's first ever Grand Slam victory over Nadal outside the grass courts of Wimbledon. His victory against Nadal moved Federer to number ten in the ATP rankings, and made him the oldest player <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> since Bill Tilden won Wimbledon in 1930.|$|E

Jackson said that Obama [...] "made the case we've been here before, but not this time will we linger. This time we're going to higher ground." ...|$|R
50|$|Roberts spend {{nine years}} at Prenton Park and made almost 270 league {{appearances}} for the club. It was whilst at Tranmere that Roberts came closest <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> domestic honour, {{as he was}} part of the Tranmere side which reached the club's first ever major cup final, the 2000 Football League Cup Final, where they narrowly lost out 2-1 to Premier League side Leicester City whilst they were still in the second tier. After a midtable finish that campaign, however, Roberts first full season at the club saw Tranmere relegated in bottom place.|$|R
5|$|In the 1982 season, Mouton {{finished}} {{a close second}} overall to Walter Röhrl, after wins in Portugal, Brazil and Greece, and helped Audi to its first manufacturers' title. Her campaign the following year resulted in fifth place. With the team having four top drivers for 1984, Mouton's participation on world championship level became part-time. In 1985, she won the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in the United States, setting a record time in the process. In 1986, she moved to Peugeot and won the German Rally Championship as the first female driver <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> championship in rallying. Soon after securing the title, Mouton retired from rallying due to the ban of Group B supercars. In 1988, she co-founded the international motorsport event Race of Champions in memory of her former rival Henri Toivonen. Mouton became {{the first president of}} the FIA's Women & Motor Sport Commission in 2010 and the FIA's manager in the World Rally Championship in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Sörenstam's life {{both on and}} off {{the golf}} course changed in 2005. In February, she {{announced}} that she had filed for divorce from David Esch, her husband of eight years, and this was finalised in August but it did not adversely affect her golf. Her achievements included being the first player in LPGA history <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> three consecutive years at the LPGA Championship and the first golfer in LPGA or PGA history to win the same event five consecutive years at the Mizuno Classic. 11 wins in 21 tournaments entered worldwide included victory in the Scandinavian TPC hosted by Annika where she presented herself the trophy, giving her an eighth Money List title, tying the LPGA record, an eighth Rolex Player of the Year (POY) award (a record) and a sixth Vare Trophy. She is the only LPGA player ever to win Money List, POY award and Vare trophy in the same year in five different years. Team competition saw her make her seventh consecutive Solheim Cup appearance, her 4 points making her total 21, the event's all-time leading points earner, and the inaugural Lexus Cup was played with Sörenstam as the Captain of the victorious International Team.|$|E
5|$|The France {{national}} team's record appearance-maker as captain is Didier Deschamps, who led {{the team}} out 52 times during his 103-cap tenure, which lasted through three decades. Deschamps {{is also the most}} successful France captain, having worn the armband, an indicator of the team's captain, in team victories at the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000. The Bayonne-born midfielder surpassed the previous record-holder of the France captaincy, midfielder Michel Platini, in the team's semi-final match at the latter competition. Platini became the first France captain <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> international competition after leading the team in the 1984 European Football Championship. Aside from Deschamps and Platini, only two other players have captained France over 40 occasions, defenders Roger Marche and Marcel Desailly. Marche is one of two French captains to lead the team at two FIFA World Cup competitions. Desailly captained the team to victories at the 2001 and 2003 editions of the FIFA Confederations Cup. He is one of four players to be sent off in a FIFA World Cup final; one of the other three being fellow France captain Zinedine Zidane.|$|E

50|$|Prior to Ochoa, {{the last}} <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> first <b>major</b> at the Old Course was Tony Lema, 43 years earlier in 1964. This {{was the first}} Women's British Open {{sponsored}} by Ricoh, the previous twenty were by Weetabix.|$|R
50|$|The {{country has}} had less success in women's golf. The only South African woman <b>to</b> have <b>won</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> was Sally Little, {{who won the}} LPGA Championship in 1980.

5|$|Under Sam Omerod {{the club}} {{achieved}} promotion to the First Division {{for the first}} time, and five years later Tom Maley became the first Manchester City manager <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> trophy, the 1904 FA Cup. A financial scandal resulted in the Football Association suspending Maley and seventeen players in 1906, leaving Harry Newbould {{with the task of}} assembling a makeshift side at short notice. In 1912 Ernest Mangnall joined City from local rivals Manchester United, but was unable to replicate the success he had enjoyed with the Reds. Upon Mangnall's departure in 1924 the roles of secretary and manager were separated, with David Ashworth appointed manager and Wilf Wild as secretary. This arrangement continued during Peter Hodge's time as manager, though the roles merged again when Wild became manager in 1932. Wild became the club's longest serving manager, winning the FA Cup and League Championship during his fourteen-year tenure. By the time Sam Cowan replaced Wild the roles of secretary and manager were separated permanently. Cowan lasted only one season, and was replaced by Jock Thomson. He gained promotion, but did not make a lasting impact at the top level.|$|E
5|$|With a {{combined}} total of 210 matches played, the Big Four have played many notable matches. The 2008 Wimbledon final and the 2012 Australian Open finals are {{considered by some}} to be the greatest matches of all time. Novak Djokovic saved match points against Roger Federer at the 2010 and 2011 US Open semifinals, whereas Federer ended Djokovic's 43-match winning streak in the 2011 French Open semifinals. The 4 hour 50 minute 2012 Australian Open semifinal between Murray and Djokovic is said to have given Murray the belief he needed to match {{the other members of the}} Big Four. Moreover, every Grand Slam tournament final of 2012, all played between the Big Four, holds some historical significance. The 2012 Australian Open final was the longest Grand Slam tournament final in terms of time played, the 2012 French Open saw Rafael Nadal break the record for the most number of titles at the French Open, whereas Djokovic was attempting to become the first man to hold all four Majors since Rod Laver in 1969. The 2012 Wimbledon final saw Federer equal the record for most Wimbledon titles when he came out victorious against Murray, who became the first British man since 1938 to appear in the final. The 2012 US Open final was the equal longest final in US Open history, and Murray became the first British man since 1938 <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>a</b> <b>Major</b> title, and the only British man to do so in the Open Era. He also became the only man to win Olympic Singles Gold and the US Open back-to-back.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} {{his first}} season with Liverpool, Collymore and Fowler's {{partnership}} {{was one of the most}} feared attacking partnerships in the Premiership (having plundered 55 goals between them), while Collymore had also received an International call up. Collymore was in the Liverpool side for the FA Cup Final, but was substituted in favour of Ian Rush (in his final appearance for Liverpool) in the 74th minute with the match still goalless, and watched from the sidelines when Manchester United's Eric Cantona fired home the winning goal with five minutes left on the clock. It would be the closest that Collymore would come <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> trophy in his playing career.|$|R
50|$|O'Meara's win came in his 15th {{attempt at}} Augusta, setting {{a record for}} {{appearances}} before a victory.
