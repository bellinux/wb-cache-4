5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> {{regime was}} overthrown, a new Cambodian {{government}} supported by Vietnam, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established. The Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, {{was unhappy with}} Vietnam's influence over the PRK government. Deng proposed to Sihanouk that he co-operate with <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> to overthrow the PRK government, but rejected it, as he opposed the genocidal policies pursued by <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> {{while they were in}} power. In March 1981 Sihanouk established a resistance movement, FUNCINPEC which was complemented by a small resistance army known as Armée Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS). He appointed In Tam, who had briefly served as Prime Minister in the Khmer Republic, as the commander-in-chief of ANS. The ANS needed military aid from China, and Deng seized the opportunity to sway Sihanouk into collaborating with <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge.</b> Sihanouk reluctantly agreed, and started talks in March 1981 with <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> and the Son Sann-led Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) on a unified anti-PRK resistance movement.|$|E
5|$|On New Year's Day 1975 <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> {{launched}} their final offensive against {{the forces of}} Lon Nol. Neither the agony of the Cambodian people nor the resignation of Lon Nol could halt or slow <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> advance. By 17 April, Phnom Penh had fallen and the nation slid into darkness. In the new Year Zero, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge,</b> under the leadership of Pol Pot, began its descent into mass murder and auto-genocide.|$|E
5|$|Also {{hidden from}} {{scrutiny}} was the growing antagonism between <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> and their North Vietnamese allies. The radical {{leadership of the}} party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master. <b>The</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate. After {{the signing of the}} Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge,</b> hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by the signing of the accords to turn their air power completely on <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge,</b> this too was blamed on Hanoi. During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.|$|E

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> had no {{air force}} and only limited {{anti-aircraft}} capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was suspected that <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched surface to air missiles and so the evacuation helicopters were painted with infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare dispensers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the Vietnamese occupation, the Kampuchean {{resistance}} groups had limited contact with each other due to their differences. Even though <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> enjoyed widespread international recognition, by 1980 the organization was under pressure to reform itself from the international community. ASEAN, which had backed <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> throughout their diplomatic confrontations with the PRK regime at the UN General Assembly in 1979, urged <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> leadership to put its blood-stained image behind it in order to join forces with other non-communist movements. However, the idea of forming an alliance with <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> initially caused a certain degree of uneasiness within the leadership circles of the FUNCINPEC and the KPNLF, because both groups were leery about joining with a communist organization well known for its brutality. Nonetheless, early in 1981, Sihanouk and Son Sann began engaging in talks with Khieu Samphan, President of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea, to discuss the prospect of forming an alliance.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> leadership, {{with much}} of its {{political}} and military structures shattered by the Vietnamese invasion, was forced to take refuge in Thailand, where it was warmly welcomed by the Thai Government. Despite the overwhelming economic challenges brought by <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> and the accompanying refugees, the Thai Government sheltered and protected <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> at Khao Larn camp in Trat Province. Meanwhile, in Phnom Penh, the new Kampuchean regime tried to rebuild the country’s economic and social life, which was largely destroyed by decades of political upheavals and constant warfare. However, efforts to rebuild the country were severely hampered {{by the lack of}} educated and qualified personnel, as most educated people had either fled the country or had been murdered by <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> regime during the previous four years. By the end of the year, the new regime’s attempts at nation-building were further challenged by several anti-Vietnamese resistance groups operating along the western regions of the country.|$|E

50|$|In 1975, {{because of}} the cut of US aid, all the republican government's leaders wanted to stop the war without conditions. However, Fernandez refused to {{negotiate}} with <b>the</b> <b>Khmers</b> <b>rouges</b> if <b>the</b> government would make FANK lay down their arms during the negotiation; for this reason, he resigned as army chief. The government let <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>rouges</b> take Phnom Penh without real battle {{for the purpose of}} negotiation.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1960s {{he was a}} general and <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge's</b> chief-of-staff.

He became very {{powerful}} within the party, especially in the south-west zone. He was named by Pol Pot as leader of the national army of Democratic Kampuchea. He lost the lower part of one leg in fighting around 1970.|$|R

5|$|In March 1992, {{the start}} of the UNTAC mission in Cambodia was marked by the arrival of 22,000 UN peacekeepers, which {{included}} troops from 22 countries, 6,000 officials, 3,500 police and 1,700 civilian employees and electoral volunteers. The mission was led by Yasushi Akashi. In June 1992, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> formally established the National Union Party of Kampuchea, and announced that it would not register to participate in the upcoming elections. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> also refused to disarm its forces in accordance with the Paris agreement. Then, to prevent ethnic Vietnamese from taking part in the elections, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> started massacring Vietnamese civilian communities, causing hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese to flee Cambodia. Towards the end of 1992, Khmer Rouge forces advanced into Kampong Thom in order to gain a strategic foothold, before UN peacekeeping forces were fully deployed there. In {{the months leading up to}} the elections, several UN military patrols were attacked as they entered Khmer Rouge-held territory.|$|E
50|$|Arguable {{examples}} include the destruction of Dresden {{at the end of}} World War II and <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge's</b> destruction in Cambodia.|$|R
50|$|Between 327,000 and 541,000 {{ethnic and}} {{religious}} minorities in Cambodia are estimated to {{have been killed by}} <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge's</b> genocides against them.|$|R
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} Vietnamese {{invasion}} of Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, who were <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge's</b> political ally, launched a punitive invasion of Vietnam.|$|R
5|$|On 18 March, the Cambodian National Assembly deposed Sihanouk {{and named}} Lon Nol as {{provisional}} head of state. This led Sihanouk to immediately establish a government-in-exile in Beijing and to ally himself with North Vietnam, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge,</b> the NLF, and the Laotian Pathet Lao. In doing so, Sihanouk lent {{his name and}} popularity {{in the rural areas}} of Cambodia to a movement over which he had little control. The North Vietnamese response to the coup was swift. PAVN began directly supplying large amounts of weapons and advisors to <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge,</b> and Cambodia plunged into civil war.|$|E
5|$|Vietnamese were {{slaughtered}} {{and dumped}} in the Mekong River {{at the hands of}} Lon Nol's anti-Communist forces. <b>The</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> later imitated Lon Nol's actions.|$|E
5|$|Despite ongoing {{threats from}} <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> during the elections, on 28 May 1993, FUNCINPEC won 45.47 {{percent of the}} vote, against 38.23 percent for the Cambodian People’s Party. Though clearly defeated, Hun Sen {{refused to accept the}} results of the election, so his Defense Minister, Sin Song, {{announced}} the secession of the eastern provinces of Cambodia, which had supported the Cambodian People’s Party. Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of FUNCINPEC and son of Sihanouk, agreed to form a coalition government with the Cambodian People’s Party so the country would not break up. On 21 September 1993, the Cambodian Constituent Assembly approved a new Constitution and Ranariddh became First Prime Minister, and he appointed Hun Sen as the Second Prime Minister. On 23 September 1993, the constitutional monarchy was restored with Norodom Sihanouk as the head of state. In July 1994, the Cambodian Government outlawed <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> for its continuous violations of the Paris Agreement. Most significantly, the Cambodian Government also specifically recognised the genocide and atrocities which occurred under Democratic Kampuchea. By 1998, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> was completely dissolved.|$|E
50|$|The border war {{followed}} a wet season / dry season rhythm. Generally, the heavily armed Vietnamese forces conducted offensive operations {{during the dry}} seasons, and <b>the</b> Chinese-backed <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> held <b>the</b> initiative during the rainy seasons. In 1982, Vietnam launched a largely unsuccessful offensive against <b>the</b> main <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> base at Phnom Malai in the Cardamom Mountains.|$|R
5000|$|... 28-30 January: Vietnamese {{artillery}} fired {{about one}} hundred 130mm shells, mortars and rockets at positions of <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge's</b> 320th Division near the Khao Din Refugee Camp about 34 {{miles south of}} Aranyaprathet. This was followed by an infantry assault on Khao Ta-ngoc.|$|R
50|$|In December 1978, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and overthrew <b>the</b> genocidal <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> regime, ending <b>the</b> Cambodian Genocide and {{installing}} {{a new government}} led by <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> defectors. <b>The</b> Reagan administration authorized the provision of aid to a coalition called <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF), run by Son Sann. In 1989, Vietnamese forces were withdrawn from Cambodia, after having successfully quelled <b>the</b> uprising by <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> and KPNLF insurgents.|$|R
5|$|In April 1952 Sihanouk married Paule Monique Izzi, the {{daughter}} of Pomme Peanga Cambodian lady, and Jean-François Izzi, a French banker of Italian ancestry. Monique became Sihanouk's lifelong partner, and in the 1990s she changed her name to Monineath. Before his marriage to Monique, Sihanouk had married five other women including Phat Kanhol, Sisowath Pongsanmoni, Sisowath Monikessan, Mam Manivan Phanivong, and Thavet Norleak. Monikessan died of childbirth in 1946, and his marriages to the other women all ended in divorce. Sihanouk sired fourteen children with five different wives except for Thavet Norleak, who bore him no children. During <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> years, five children and fourteen grandchildren disappeared; Sihanouk believed they were killed by <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} before <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> {{came to power in}} 1975, Cambodia had a flourishing music scene. Particularly in Phnom Penh, artists were {{combining}} traditional and native styles with those from the West.|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 1968, <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> {{launched}} their first offensive. It was aimed more at gathering weapons and spreading propaganda than in seizing territory since, at that time, the adherents {{of the insurgency}} numbered no more than 4–5,000. During the same month, the communists established the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea as the military wing of the party. As early {{as the end of}} the Battambang revolt, Sihanouk had begun to reevaluate his relationship with the communists. His earlier agreement with the Chinese had availed him nothing. They had not only failed to restrain the North Vietnamese, but they had actually involved themselves (through <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge)</b> in active subversion within his country.|$|E
50|$|After 1975, the PMLI {{had a close}} {{relationship}} with the Communist Party of Kampuchea, even after the invasion of Cambodia by Vietnam. A PMLI leader visited a CPK-controlled zone of Cambodia in 1987. After Pol Pot's arrest in 1997, the PMLI denounced <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge's</b> betrayal.|$|R
5000|$|Despite its {{complete}} destruction, {{the empty}} land where the cathedral once stood became {{the location of}} a multi-faith Christmas celebration in 1979, <b>the</b> year <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge's</b> regime was overthrown. [...] The town hall of Phnom Penh now stands {{on the site of the}} former cathedral.|$|R
50|$|Chhay died {{shortly after}} <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge's</b> entry into Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975. The {{communist}} administration ordered the city's immediate evacuation, citing {{a risk of}} American bombing and lack of food stocks, and nearly the entire population was deported to the countryside. Chhay {{is thought to have}} died, like thousands of others, en route, or possibly to have been killed by <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> troops.|$|R
5|$|Operation Eagle Pull was the United States {{military}} evacuation by air of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on 12 April 1975. At {{the beginning}} of April 1975, Phnom Penh, {{one of the last}} remaining strongholds of the Khmer Republic, was surrounded by <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> and totally dependent on aerial resupply through Pochentong Airport. With a Khmer Rouge victory imminent, the US government made contingency plans for the evacuation of US nationals and allied Cambodians by helicopter to ships in the Gulf of Thailand. Operation Eagle Pull took place on the morning of 12 April 1975 and was a tactical success carried out without any loss of life. Five days later the Khmer Republic collapsed and <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> occupied Phnom Penh.|$|E
5|$|The North Vietnamese {{reacted to}} the {{political}} changes in Cambodia by sending Premier Phạm Văn Đồng to meet Sihanouk in China and recruit him into an alliance with <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge.</b> Pol Pot was also contacted by the Vietnamese who now offered him whatever resources he wanted for his insurgency against the Cambodian government. Pol Pot and Sihanouk were actually in Beijing {{at the same time}} but the Vietnamese and Chinese leaders never informed Sihanouk of the presence of Pol Pot or allowed the two men to meet. Shortly after, Sihanouk issued an appeal by radio to the people of Cambodia to rise up against the government and support <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge.</b> In doing so, Sihanouk lent his name and popularity in the rural areas of Cambodia to a movement over which he had little control. In May 1970, Pol Pot finally returned to Cambodia and the pace of the insurgency greatly increased. After Sihanouk showed his support for <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> by visiting them in the field, their ranks swelled from 6,000 to 50,000 fighters.|$|E
5|$|The other non-communist {{organisation}} was the National United Front for an Independent, Peaceful, Neutral, and Cooperative Cambodia, {{formed by}} Sihanouk and {{known by its}} French acronym FUNCINPEC. The organization was formed after Sihanouk had severed ties with <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> following his representation on its behalf at the UN Security Council. As the leader of FUNCINPEC, Sihanouk called on the UN General Assembly to expel Khmer Rouge representatives for their crimes while in power and to keep Kampuchea’s seat at the UN vacant {{on the basis that}} neither <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge</b> nor the Vietnamese-installed PRK had the mandate to represent the Kampuchean people. He also criticised ASEAN for its continued recognition of <b>the</b> <b>Khmer</b> <b>Rouge,</b> and specifically Thailand for enabling Chinese arms shipments to travel through its territory to supply the notorious communist group. Despite the strength, effectiveness and popularity of the KPNLF and the FUNCINPEC, both resistance groups were plagued by internal divisions caused by the lack of unity, leadership struggles, corruption and alleged abuses of human rights.|$|E
