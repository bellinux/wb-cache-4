5000|$|A French Basque, Clément Duhour {{was the son}} of a baker. He {{was also}} the younger brother of Édouard Duhour. At age 16, he won his first French {{national}} championships in both the shot put and discus. Almost simultaneously, he was expelled from the public high school in Bayonne for [...] "indiscipline". Subsequently, his father sent him to Paris to become an apprentice salesman at the Félix Potin grocery store. Three days later, he quit the apprenticeship to become an entertainer at the Lapin Agile club under the stage name Guy Lormont. In 1932, he took part in the Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles shot put competition, where he <b>tossed</b> <b>well</b> beyond the 45-foot mark without much training. His brother, Édouard, was also a French shot putter, who competed in the event at the Olympics the previous year. The following year, Clément was again crowned French national shot put champion.|$|R
5000|$|On occasion, tossing formed {{part of a}} costumed {{masquerade}} {{in which}} the <b>tossed</b> animal as <b>well</b> as the participants would be decorated and masked. Gentlemen would dress as mythical heroes, Roman warriors, satyrs, centaurs or jesters. Ladies would dress as nymphs, goddesses or muses. The <b>tossed</b> animals—hares as <b>well</b> as foxes—would be [...] "dressed up in bits of cardboard, gaudy cloth and tinsel", sometimes being decorated as caricatures of well-known individuals. At {{the conclusion of the}} tossing, the guests would head off in a torchlit procession or go indoors for a grand banquet.|$|R

50|$|Starting QB Craig Krenzel {{would miss}} the contest from an elbow injury he {{suffered}} against N.C. State, and Sr. Quarterback Scott McMullen of Granvile, OH {{would lead the}} team {{for the first time}} since 2001 (he played mop up duty for the Bucks in 2002). It would be the Buckeyes striking first as Scott McMullen sent a 7-yard strike to Sr. Drew Carter, and the Buckeyes had a 7-0 lead. Josh Harris matched McMullen’s touchdown with a 7-yard <b>toss</b> as <b>well.</b> Unfortunately for the Falcons, that would be their only score of the first half.|$|R

5000|$|Behindwoods {{rated the}} film 1 out of 5 and {{mentioned}} [...] "Overall, Pen Singam {{has got a}} pretty neat script, which holds one’s attention, but lacks in contemporary value. A couple of holes in the script, a weak and meaningless comedy track and lackluster music come {{in the way of}} the Pen Singam’s roar". Rediff noted [...] "Technically, the film manages to scrape through; it's the script that stumbles and almost grinds to a halt frequently, while the cast itself looks clueless and plain out of it, at times. Logic has gone for a <b>toss</b> as <b>well</b> and of reason, there's very little".|$|R
50|$|The first Well that Divnick {{made was}} as an {{offering}} device {{for the children}} in his church. He {{began to see the}} potential as a non-profit fund raising device in public locations, and the company has shipped thousands of Wells all over the world where they have raised in excess of $200 million for charity. 100% of the revenue stays with the charity. Divnick and his company never receives any portion of the coins <b>tossed</b> into the <b>Wells.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Saint Asterius of Ostia (d. 3rd century AD) was a martyred priest. Information on this saint {{is based}} on the {{apocryphal}} Acts of Saint Callixtus. [...] According to tradition, he was a priest of Rome who recovered the body of Pope Callixtus I after it had been <b>tossed</b> into a <b>well</b> around 222 AD. [...] Asterius buried Callixtus' body at night but was arrested for this action by the prefect Alexander and then killed by being thrown off a bridge into the Tiber River.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{possible}} that Callixtus was martyred around 222 or 223, perhaps during a popular uprising, but the legend that he was thrown down a well has no historical foundation, though the church does contain an ancient well. According to the apocryphal Acts of Saint Callixtus, Asterius, a priest of Rome, recovered the body of Callixtus after it had been <b>tossed</b> into a <b>well</b> and buried Callixtus' body at night. [...] Asterius was arrested for this action by the prefect Alexander and then killed by being thrown off a bridge into the Tiber River.|$|R
5000|$|During the games, many {{scenarios}} {{were played}} out, especially the strategies mentioned earlier on, such as launch on warning, {{which did not}} make the cut; the idea of leaving a launch decision up to a computer was in no one's best interest. Point blank attacking Moscow also {{did not make the}} cut, considering just how many nuclear weapons the Soviets had. They would only strike back. Deploying NATO armies {{seemed like a good idea}} before the games, until the US realized that the taking of one piece of land meant they would lose much more than they gained. Limited nuclear attacks were also tossed. The Soviets only interpreted the strikes as attacks on their culture and struck back, rather than see that the US was quite capable of winning and give up. The games had the US strike back, which resulted in all out nuclear Armageddon with more than half a billion peopled killed, leaving a great part of the northern hemisphere uninhabitable. Needless to say, this strategy scared everyone and was <b>tossed</b> as <b>well.</b>|$|R
50|$|Haren {{made his}} major league debut {{at the age}} of 22, on June 30, 2003. He was the {{starting}} pitcher against the San Francisco Giants and allowed four runs (two earned) in six innings to pick up the loss. He recorded his first Major League win with a six-inning start where he allowed only one run against the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 19. After finishing 2003 with a 5.08 ERA for the Cardinals in 14 starts, he was sent back down to AAA Memphis for the 2004 season. He received a late-season call-up, and made five appearances in the postseason for the Cardinals, including two in the World Series. The Cardinals were swept by the Boston Red Sox, but Haren pitched <b>well,</b> <b>tossing</b> 4 scoreless innings.|$|R
50|$|East of Oregon {{the tornado}} tore through several farms before {{impacting}} residential subdivisions in Stoughton. One person was crushed {{to death in}} their basement from fireplace and chimney bricks that crashed through the floor. Numerous homes, businesses, farm buildings, vehicles, power-lines, trees, and other personal effects were either damaged or destroyed along its path that grew to a maximum width of about 600 yards north of Stoughton. As for residential structures, 220 sustained minor damage, 84 had major damage, and 69 were destroyed. As for business structures, 6 sustained minor damage, 1 had major damage, and 1 was destroyed. As for agricultural structures, 5 sustained minor damage, 5 had major damage, and 40 were destroyed. Several vehicles were flipped and <b>tossed</b> as <b>well.</b> Some homes in town were completely leveled, and an F4 rating was considered. Further investigation revealed that the homes were not well-built, and the slow (sometimes nearly stationary) forward movement of the tornado negated a rating higher than F3. After striking Stoughton, the tornado caused damage to trees and crops north of Busseyville before dissipating. Debris from this tornado was lofted by the parent updraft and carried downstream to scattered locations in the counties of Jefferson, Waukesha, Milwaukee, Walworth, Racine, and Kenosha. 23 people were injured.|$|R
5000|$|The second violent tornado {{of the day}} in Illinois {{may have}} {{developed}} as far southwest as Elgin, but was first observed at about 5:00 p.m. CDT near Fox River Grove, though its path is officially believed to have begun near Middlebury. It then produced a discontinuous [...] damage path through Fox River Grove, North Barrington, and Lake Zurich. The most intense damage, posthumously rated F4, occurred at Lake Zurich Manor, about 1.5 mi northwest of downtown Lake Zurich; there, roughly 75 homes were leveled and 200 severely damaged. The Acorn Acres subdivision, northeast of and adjourning Lake Zurich Manor, reported scattered damage and debris with about 12 homes severely damaged. [...] According to official plots from Storm Data, the tornado lifted after hitting Acorn Acres, though non-tornadic damages to trees and buildings occurred as far as the intersection of Illinois Route 63 and Gilmer Road. There, severe winds, possibly downbursts, destroyed four homes, one brewery, and a plastic-manufacturing site, though at least one source indicates that the tornado was likely still present at that place. In all, the tornado damaged 400-500 homes and destroyed about 100. An air-conditioning unit weighing 1000 lb was thrown [...]5 mi. Cars were picked up and <b>tossed</b> as <b>well.</b>|$|R
50|$|The tosser {{balances}} the caber upright, tapered end downwards, against {{his or her}} shoulder and neck; the caber being supported by stewards or fellow-competitors while being placed into position. The tosser then crouches, sliding his interlocked hands down the caber and under the rounded base, and lifts it in his cupped hands. While standing he must balance the caber upright - not an easy victory with the heavier end at the top, and less-experienced tossers {{may be unable to}} stop the caber falling to one side after lifting it. The tosser then walks or runs a few paces forward to gain momentum, and flips the tapered end upwards so that the large end hits the ground first and - if <b>well</b> <b>tossed</b> - the caber falls directly away from the tosser.|$|R
5000|$|Once upon a time, {{there was}} a woman named Therese von Ludowing who lived far from society in Thüringen with her son, März von Ludowing. But, Therese's {{reputation}} for her herbal remedies resulted with her being captured by two men in plague masks to be condemned a witch--due to the Black Plague occurring at the time. Although Therese attempts to fight them off when her son unknowingly brought the men to their hut, she is captured while März is <b>tossed</b> into the <b>well</b> outside their home, and she curses the world in her final breath before her execution. The following night, his once white hair stained black - [...] "the color of dusk" [...] - and no memory of who he was, the reborn Märchen von Friedhof emerged from the well after being awakened by a living doll named Elise. Elise compels Märchen to aid seven [...] "princesses" [...] in taking revenge in seven tales to achieve their own revenge. Each tale revolves around a deadly sin.|$|R
50|$|The tornado {{initially}} {{touched down}} just inside western McCracken County, Kentucky and {{moved across the}} northern fringes of Paducah. The tornado was at EF2 strength in McCracken County, demolishing an abandoned mobile home, causing roof and siding damage to many structures (most of them being homes), destroying the foyer of a church, bending road signs, ripping a wooden fence out of the ground, and blowing over chain-link fences. At one building, three metal roll-up doors were blown in {{and part of a}} wall was blown out. The tops of three steel power transmission towers were bent over, power lines were downed, train car covers were blown off, and a sports utility vehicle was blown 30 yd into a ditch as well. Some damage to buildings and cooling towers at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant was noted, though no hazardous materials were released. The tornado crossed the Ohio River into Massac County, Illinois where it went through Brookport at low-end EF3 strength and completely destroyed dozens of mobile homes, many of which were blown over 100 ft. Also in Brookport, a frail site-built home was leveled, and dozens of homes, garages, storage buildings, and businesses sustained structural damage. Hundreds of trees were downed and cars were <b>tossed</b> as <b>well.</b> The tornado caused some minor damage to guard rails on the Ohio River bridge that carries traffic from Paducah to Brookport on U.S. Highway 45. East of Brookport, the tornado maintained EF3 strength as it impacted the small rural community of Shady Grove. Mobile homes in Shady Grove were obliterated, with their frames wrapped around trees. An empty school bus was picked up and thrown, and a two-story home was pushed off of its foundation and had many of its first floor walls ripped off, along with its porch. Past Shady Grove, the tornado struck the neighboring community of Unionville, where additional low-end EF3 damage occurred. Many trees in Unionville were snapped, and a large double-wide mobile home was obliterated and swept away, with debris scattered 500 feet. The home's heavy 7-by-12 foot concrete porch slab was lifted and moved by the tornado. The tornado weakened to EF2 strength as it moved briefly through Pope County and then back across the Ohio River into Livingston County, destroying several mobile homes and barns in this area and snapping numerous trees. In Lyon County, the tornado downed additional trees before dissipating. Three people were killed and 33 additional people were injured along the tornado's 42-mile long path. All fatalities occurred in mobile homes that were destroyed in Brookport. Snow that fell in the area during the days following the tornado hindered cleanup efforts.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis was to {{identify}} management factors that affect the extent of exploratory behaviour (ground pecking, scratching) as well as quantitative and qualitative as-pects of dust-bathing behaviour in laying hens kept in commercial furnished cages (‘small group housing’) and aviaries. Based on the results, it should be considered which management measures can be recommended for farmers to enhance hen welfare. The feasibility of direct observations of dust-bathing behaviour as well as video observations of exploratory and dust-bathing behaviour was tested in two aviaries. The direct observations were judged to be unfeasible under the conditions encountered. For {{the analysis of the}} video recordings, different sampling intervals for instantaneous scan sampling, different extents of observation time, and intra- and inter-observer reliabilities were compared and the most ap-propriate observation scheme selected. Applying the selected scheme (observing the first 16 minutes of every hour distributed over two consecutive light days with a sample interval of two minutes), within the range of environmental conditions found in 22 aviaries, pecking, scratching and dust-bathing behaviour was performed on average 25, 2 and 7 % of the obser-vation time. Hen numbers in the litter were positively associated with stocking density and group size. More scratching was performed with increasing litter height as well as in humid litter. If no litter had been provided, thus substrate consisted of dust and faeces, a reduced proportion of dust-bathing was found. The same method was then used in 16 furnished cage systems. On average 12 % of the total hen number were found on the scratching mats. The hens spent 8 % of the observed time pecking at the mat, 4 % dust-bathing and 0. 4 % scratch-ing. Higher proportions were found on the mats and more dust-bathing behaviour occurred, if substrate was provided. Also with increasing light intensity and stocking density more hens were observed on the mats. More pecking and scratching occurred in conditions of higher stocking density, probably due to social facilitation, and of increased mat area per hen. With increasing mat numbers per cage less pecking was observed. Wider mats led to increased dust-bathing behaviour. Finally, 129 dust-baths recorded in 17 aviaries were analysed in detail. On average they lasted 17 minutes, with the tossing phase taking 69 % of this time, including on average 2 vertical wing shakes and 3 scratches with one leg per minute tossing phase. Dust-bath duration de-creased with increasing litter height. Litter type influenced all recorded parameters: dust-bath duration was highest on straw and lowest on fine material and fine material mixed with straw, where on both also the proportion of the tossing phase was lowest. The number of vertical wing shakes during the dust-bath was highest on straw and lowest on fine material mixed with straw as against the frequency of vertical wing shaking that was lowest on straw and highest on fine material. If dust-bathing hens were disturbed twice or more, dust-bathing duration decreased. With increasing light intensity a decreased proportion of the <b>tossing</b> phase as <b>well</b> as a reduced number of vertical wing shakes were recorded. Possibly the light stimulated the hens to dust-bath more often with less tossing behaviour per performance. The observed variation of the dust-bathing parameters could reflect successful adaptation or frustration of the hens. The litter and light conditions on the investigated farms were predominantly restrictive in terms of stimulation of exploration and dust-bathing behaviour. Thus, it was only possible to analyse possible associations between these factors and exploration and dust-bathing behav-iour within the range found. Based on the results the following management recommendations can be given: To allow hens in furnished cages more normal activity, substrate availability should be improved and mat space and light intensity increased. With regard to aviaries as well litter availability should be improved. Litter height should not be too low. Disturbances during dust-bathing should be prevented, but no influencing factors could be identified.
