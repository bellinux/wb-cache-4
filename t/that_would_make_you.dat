500|$|Thematically, {{influences}} behind The Operative: No One Lives Forever {{were primarily}} 1960s spy-themed films, novels, television shows, {{as well as}} historical references. When {{it was decided that}} NOLF {{was going to be a}} 1960s spy game, lead designer Craig Hubbard started immersing himself in the subject matter, in order to [...] "develop some fluency" [...] in it. As he explained, he [...] "was a big fan of early Bond films, but didn't know a lot about the whole spy craze. So I watched the Derek Flint movies , Modesty Blaise, Matt Helm, , Avengers â€“ anything I could get my hands on." [...] Other influences included books, such as The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, TV shows like The Saint, The Pink Panther films, commando movies, such as The Guns of Navarone, as well as [...] "lots of historical references, encompassing everything from books and documentaries on the spy trade to fashion catalogs and interior-design books." [...] The basis for the biological explosives plot was the 1967 film Casino Royale. According to Hubbard, [...] "the idea was to create a game <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> feel like a superspy, so we tried to come up with situations, characters, and settings to support that goal." [...] During the course of the game, the player can hear explicit popular culture references, including the TV series The Prisoner and The Fugitive, the Matt Helm films The Silencers and The Ambushers, and exotica musicians Les Baxter and Sondi Sodsai. Other conversations allude to major events of the time, such as the studio years of The Beatles, and the commercial failure of the Edsel automobile.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Happy, master?' I cried. 'Strange happiness! If {{you would}} hear me without being angry, I might offer some advice <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> happier.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For ten minutes," [...] said Marie. [...] "What good <b>would</b> <b>that</b> do <b>you?</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> only <b>make</b> <b>you</b> unhappy {{when the}} ten minutes were gone and past." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought a}} little fright would do you good," [...] said the mate, {{speaking}} quickly, [...] "and <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> appreciate {{me a little}} more when I did come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He has fed you, clothed you, educated {{you since}} you was a babby; nursed you, maybe, in sickness, {{and prayed for}} you, no doubt <b>that</b> God <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> a good, obedient and loving son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Raymond! Raymond!" [...] {{she then}} said, in a husky dreamy voice, [...] "how good and kind you have been. I {{know there was}} {{something}} <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> very, very glad!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What can I do {{to comfort}} you most, Joe? I'll send my good Ben {{to help you}} to bed, and will be here myself when the surgeon goes his rounds. Is there {{anything}} else <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> more easy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{do those}} robbers care for that? We {{are all the}} better prey for them! I have heard {{histories}} of Spanish cruelty and lawlessness <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> shudder! You cannot guess at the dreadful presentiments that have haunted me ever since I had my husband's letter.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From what I {{have seen}} of him, I should think <b>that</b> Chalmers <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> an {{excellent}} husband," [...] Nigel declared, as he rang the bell. [...] "You need a firm hand, and I should {{think he would}} be quite capable of using it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{did more}} than a favour, Dr. John: she pledged her very honour <b>that</b> she <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> some return; and if she cannot pay you in affection, she ought to hand out a business-like equivalent, {{in the shape of}} some {{rouleaux}} of gold pieces." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None in the world, Watson. Thank you, I need no help in {{arranging}} the clothes. You will please keep your distance. Now, Watson, {{there is one}} other condition <b>that</b> I <b>would</b> <b>make.</b> <b>You</b> will seek help, not from the man you mention, but from the one that I choose." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{there was}} Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud and grand, but {{as good as}} she could be when she warn't stirred up; but when she was she had a look <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> wilt in your tracks, like her father. She was beautiful.|$|E
6000|$|... "But he has not." [...] And {{then she}} stopped {{a moment to}} consider. [...] "No, he has not. He {{never said a word}} to me <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> angry with him if you knew of it. Except, perhaps, that he called me Lucy; and that was my fault, not his." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I know, I {{can solve}} the riddle now. Your years are different, of course, like {{everything}} else in this latitude. A month is called a year with you, and <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you,</b> let me see--how much is twelve times thirty-one? Oh, hang it, nearly five hundred, I should think. Why am I such a duffer at mental arithmetic! It is just the contrary--how many twelves in thirty-one? About two and a half in round numbers, and that's absurd, as you are not a baby. Oh, I have it: your seasons are called years, of course--why didn't I see it before! No, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> only seven and a half. Ah, yes, I see it now: a year means two years, or two of your years--summer and winter--mean a year; and that just makes you sixteen, exactly what I had imagined. Is it not so, Yoletta?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And if I saw you {{becoming}} {{interested in}} any one in a way <b>that</b> I thought <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> unhappy, it <b>would</b> be my duty to warn you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You take {{a severe}} and I venture {{to believe a}} prejudiced view of the {{situation}} between us," [...] he replied. [...] "I never promised <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> a peeress. Such a thing never entered into my head. Every pledge I made to you when we were married, I kept. You cannot say the same." ...|$|R
60|$|Must. Poor heart, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> soon <b>make</b> <b>you</b> dry again. But all is barren in this isle: Here we may lie at hull, {{till the}} wind blow nor' and by south, ere we can cry, a sail! a sail! a {{sight of a}} white apron: And, therefore, here's another sup to comfort us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{quarters}} {{are somewhat}} limited, Mr.--er--er," [...] remarked Dabster, [...] "in {{comparison with the}} size of this building. I understand the area of its side to be about 340 by 100 feet. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> occupy a proportionate space as if half of Beloochistan were placed upon a territory as large as the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, with the Province of Ontario and Belgium added." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} clothes <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> think--if anything," [...] drawled the languid Miss Devine. She was a tall, {{handsome}} girl, engaged {{at the moment}} in futile efforts to recline with elegance and comfort combined upon a horsehair sofa. Miss Kite, by reason of having secured the only easy-chair, was unpopular that evening; so that Miss Devine's remark received {{from the rest of}} the company more approbation than perhaps it merited.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, this morning, son {{acts like}} he's all worked up. He's {{one of these}} half-portion Willie-boys with Chippendale legs, but he throws out a line of talk <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> wonder if it's safe to let him run around loose. Says his mind's made up; he's going to thrash a gink {{within an inch of}} his life; going to muss up his {{features}} so bad he'll have to have 'em replanted.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must never}} think," [...] he said, [...] "to show your love for my memory by doing {{anything}} <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not <b>make</b> <b>you</b> happy. If I am anywhere around," [...] he continued with a smile, [...] "it {{will be your}} good I shall be watching for, not my own way. You will remember that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I do," [...] said Gascoyne, hastily, [...] "and do love thee {{more than}} any one in all the world, Myles; but I had thought <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>thee</b> feel more easy, {{to think that the}} Earl was not against thee. And, indeed, from all thou has told me, I do soothly think that he and Sir James mean to befriend thee and hold thee privily in kind regard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I cannot {{say that}} she has been right, father; but she deserves no such {{punishment}} as <b>that.</b> <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> her a wretched woman for ever, because she has done wrong in striving to obey you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Annette,' said Violet, {{not without}} effort, 'I see {{you have not}} the feeling <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> unhappy in giving him up, so I may speak freely. I am afraid of it. I cannot be certain that he is so {{completely}} cured of his old attachment as he supposes himself to be while the anger is fresh. He {{is as good as}} possible--quite sincere, and would never willingly pain you, whatever he may feel. But his affection for Theodora was of long standing; and without any one's fault there might be worries and vexations--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{went out}} to Chicago, eleven years ago, to witness the Grant festivities, {{there was a great}} banquet on the first night, with six hundred ex-soldiers present. The gentleman who sat next me was Mr. X. X. He was very hard of hearing, and he had a habit common to deaf people of {{shouting}} his remarks instead of delivering them in an ordinary voice. He would handle his knife and fork in reflective silence for five or six minutes at a time and then suddenly fetch out a shout <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> jump out of the United States." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There!" [...] said she, {{pointing}} to the playthings; [...] "see! all your playthings left out! Put them away quick before Andella and Rosalie see them. I would not have them know that their mothers leave their playthings about in that way for any consideration. They would think that they might do so too, and <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> {{a great deal of}} trouble. You teach them, I have no doubt, that they must always put their playthings away, and they must see that you set them a good example. Put these playthings all away quick, and carefully, and we will not let them know any thing about your leaving them out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{trust will}} be vain, for {{you are now}} in my power, and I only spare you long enough {{to tell you that}} a Blackfoot brave has just met us, who brings us the good news of what our great Blackfoot chief did when he crept into the camp of Bounding Bull and carried away his little {{daughter}} from under his very nose, and also the daughter of Leetil Tim. Wah! Did I not say <b>that</b> I <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> change your looks?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Following the film's {{release in}} October 1999, it {{garnered}} mixed reviews. A critic from BBthots.com noted [...] "there are no factors <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> me warn <b>you</b> {{to keep away}} from the movie, {{but at the same}} time, there is nothing here to make me recommend it either".|$|R
6000|$|... "But murder, Armstrong! downright murder; of {{the worst}} kind; studied--premeditated. He must have been {{thinking}} of it, and planning it, for days. A man may be worthless, and yet not such a wretch as <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> him. Can <b>you</b> really think he meant Colligan to murder his sister?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Strange as it {{may seem}} to you, it is because of my origin, my breeding, my traditions, my early associations, and such-like trifles. Not {{everybody}} can divest himself of the prejudices of a gentleman as easily as you have done, Mr. Heyst. But don't worry about my pluck. If you were to make a clean spring at me, you would receive in mid air, so to speak, something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> perfectly harmless by the time you landed. No, don't misapprehend us, Mr. Heyst. We are--er--adequate bandits; and we are after the fruit of your labours as a--er--successful swindler. It's the way of the world--gorge and disgorge!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I seed a lot, an' I heard a lot," [...] {{the colored}} woman answered. [...] "Mike's purty nigh starved, an' does his own washin'. An' {{things are in}} that state in the house <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> sick, Miss Panney, if you could see them. What the rain doesn't wash goes dirty; an' as for that old cook they've got, if she isn't drunk all the time, her mind's givin' way, an' I expect she'll end by pizenin' all of them. The vittles she gave me to eat, bein' nearly tired to death when I got thar, was sich that they give me pains that I hain't got over yit. And what would have {{happened}} if I'd eat a full meal, nobody knows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't let my bad {{management}} be {{the ruin}} of you. Take a turn from this moment. You know Who can help you, and Who, if you had thought of Him, would have kept you straight when I forgot. Put all the stuff {{out of your head}} about one man being equal to another. Equal they are; but some have the trial of ruling, others of obeying, and the last are the lucky ones. If we could only see their souls, we should know it. You'll find evening schools and lectures at Illershall; you'd better take to them, for you've more real liking for that sort of thing than for mischief; and if you finished up your education, you'd get into a line <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> happier, and where you might do much good. There--promise me that you'll think of these things, and take heed to your Sundays.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I told you, Rosa, that I wished you to {{be happy}} and <b>that</b> I <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> so if I could make anybody happy on this earth. I cannot. There are reasons now known to me, reasons in which you have no part, {{rendering}} it far better for you that you should not remain here. You must not remain here. I have determined that you shall not. I have written to the father of your lover, and he will be here to-day. All this I have done for your sake." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I can quite {{understand}} that, Ruth," [...] Margaret Carne agreed. [...] "I know if I loved any one I should {{not give him}} up merely because everybody spoke ill of him. But, you see, it is different now. It {{is not merely a}} suspicion, it is almost absolute proof; and besides, you must know that he {{spends most of his time}} in the public-house, and <b>that</b> he never <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> a good husband." ...|$|R
