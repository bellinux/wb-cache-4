5000|$|Although not {{affected}} by the scam, Jimmy and Sarah seek to have a picnic and watch <b>the</b> <b>Eds</b> get beaten up. Jonny and Plank don their respective superhero alter-egos [...] "Captain Melonhead" [...] and [...] "Splinter the Wonderwood" [...] while searching for <b>the</b> <b>Eds</b> in a city bus. Rolf leaves with overflowing luggage riding {{on the back of}} his pig Wilfred, using Wilfred's sense of smell and whatever deduction methods he has at his disposal to find <b>the</b> <b>Eds.</b> Kevin and Nazz travel via Kevin's prized bicycle. When the Kanker sisters—Lee, Marie, and May—find out what the kids plan on doing to <b>the</b> <b>Eds,</b> they go off to protect their [...] "boyfriends" [...] from the children's wrath.|$|R
500|$|When the Kankers return, {{they make}} {{multiple}} attempts to garner the Eds' attention, but the boys, engrossed {{with what they}} are watching on the T.V., ignore them. Angry, and feeling unappreciated, the Kankers start bossing <b>the</b> <b>Eds</b> around, forcing them {{to clean up the}} house. Eddy quickly grows annoyed with the situation though, and loses his temper with the Kankers, sending them crying into their room. In a moment of regret, he attempts to apologize, but is told by May to leave and to never return. <b>The</b> <b>Eds</b> gladly accept this, but upon opening the front door, they find the Kankers blocking their way, holding self-made dolls styled to look like <b>the</b> <b>Eds.</b> Dubbing <b>the</b> dolls [...] "Eddy Junior", [...] "Ed Junior" [...] and [...] "Double D Junior", the Kankers try to guilt <b>the</b> <b>Eds</b> into staying. However, this only causes the boys to flee in terror. The Kankers look after <b>the</b> <b>Eds</b> longingly as they go and declare their love for them.|$|R

Rolf {{challenges}} <b>the</b> <b>Eds</b> to make it across the Peach Creek Estates construction site, where he has set up an assault course, promising them the badge if they make it. Eddy refuses at first, but when Rolf tells him that he will give the badge to Kevin, Eddy accepts the challenge. However, Rolf tells Kevin in private {{to make sure they}} do not succeed. The competition heats up when Kevin prepares tricks, traps, and tribulations, but <b>the</b> <b>Eds</b> manage to complete Rolf's tasks thanks to the Eds' ability to stand on each other to create [...] "The Tower of Eddy". After a head-butting competition with Rolf's goat, Victor, <b>the</b> <b>Eds</b> race Kevin to win <b>the</b> badge. <b>The</b> <b>Eds</b> win <b>the</b> race, but in order for the badge to be shared fairly, Rolf rips the badge into three pieces.

5000|$|The second level, [...] "Pin the Tail on the Ed", {{begins with}} Jimmy having his {{birthday}} party with the kids, but Rolf tells <b>the</b> <b>Eds</b> {{that they are}} not allowed to go. Not one to take no for an answer, Eddy decides they will find their own way into the party. Ed suggests that they sneak in through the sewers. Despite Edd's worries, Eddy leads his friends through the sewer to sneak into and crash Jimmy's party. <b>The</b> <b>Eds</b> successfully sneak into the party. While everyone is inside Jimmy's house, <b>the</b> <b>Eds</b> break all of Jimmy's pinatas, but the Kankers pop out of one and chase them. Edd uses his slingshot to shoot down beehives in the trees so the bees chase the Kankers away.

5|$|After {{the inaugural}} 1933 Philadelphia Eagles season, Bell married Upton at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia. Days later, his {{suggestion}} to bestow {{the winner of}} the NFL championship game with <b>the</b> <b>Ed</b> Thorp Memorial Trophy was affirmed. In 1934, the Eagles finished with a 4–7 record, The Eagles' inability to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets, and his failure to sign a talented college prospect led him to adduce {{that the only way to}} bring stability to the league was to institute a draft to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent players. In 1935, his proposal for a draft was accepted, and in February 1936, the first draft kicked off, at which he acted as Master of Ceremonies. Later that month, his first child, Bert Jr., was born.|$|E

Though simple obstacles are in their way, they make it, thanks to Ed with his unquestioned strength and speed. They find a meatball-making machine in Rolf's shed, but Rolf refuses to let them use it. After Ed smashes Rolf's pig pen fence, the pigs escape, and <b>the</b> <b>Eds</b> agree {{to get them back}} in the pen only if Rolf lets them borrow the machine. Rolf agrees, and they get the pigs in the pig pen. <b>The</b> <b>Eds</b> finally make their snow cones by covering the meatballs in ice, which Ed begins to eat.|$|R

Before the cover of Sgt. Pepper's could be completed by Peter Blake, Aspinall was sent out to find photographs of all of the people that were to be shown on the front cover. Aspinall suggested the idea of Sergeant Pepper being the compere, who would introduce the group, and the reprise of the title song {{near the end of the}} album.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Jim Henson's {{work was}} aimed at mature audiences. His {{television}} program Sam and Friends was designed for young adults. During this period, his characters often appeared on late-night, comedy television programs The Jimmy Dean Show and <b>The</b> <b>Ed</b> Sullivan Show. Throughout the 1960s, Jim Henson used his puppets for profane, irreverent comedy. These early Henson creations made references to substance abuse and sexual intercourse; The A.V. Club said Henson was probably influenced {{by the work of}} Ralph Bakshi, who was also active during the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Reckless {{was kept}} by Pedersen's {{family for a}} brief time before moving to a more {{permanent}} home with the 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton. A second article about Reckless appeared in The Saturday Evening Post on October 22, 1955. These two articles and the book Reckless: Pride of the Marines (1955) were written by the commander of the 2nd Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Geer, who kept notes about Reckless during the war. She made several public appearances, including Art Linkletter's show House Party, but had to cancel an appearance on <b>The</b> <b>Ed</b> Sullivan Show due to the typhoon. Ed Sullivan had wanted her to appear on his November 7 show and was willing to pay the costs to get her there right after the scheduled, and delayed, November 5 arrival.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Older adults {{experience}} {{a higher risk}} of death in <b>the</b> emergency departments (<b>EDs),</b> in part, {{as a result of their}} comorbidities. A treatment-limiting decision is often reported for older adults who die in <b>the</b> <b>EDs.</b> <b>The</b> Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is a validated method for the scoring of comorbidities. Whether an association between the CCI and treatment-limiting decisions exists remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the CCI was associated with the treatment-limiting decisions made for older patients who die in <b>the</b> <b>EDs.</b> METHODS: A total of 2, 095 patients >/= 65 years old who died in <b>the</b> <b>EDs</b> in France and Belgium were prospectively included between 2004 and 2005. The recorded data included: 1) the CCI score; 2) patient age; 3) gender; 4) living in senior housing facilities; 5) hospitalizations occurring in the previous year; 6) presence of functional limitations (according to the Knaus classification); 7) chronic diseases; and 8) presence of organ failure(s). A treatment-limiting decision was defined as a predetermined choice not to implement therapies that would otherwise be required to sustain life. RESULTS: A treatment-limiting decision was identified in 993 (47 %) patients. Fully-adjusted logistic regression model showed that a CCI >/= 5 (OR= 25. 56 with P= 0. 037), age >/= 85 years (OR= 20. 33 with P/= 5) was associated with a treatment-limiting decision in elderly patients evaluated in <b>the</b> <b>EDs.</b> Further research is needed to corroborate this finding...|$|R
5|$|The Land of Gorch was a {{recurring}} skit {{that appeared in}} season one of the American comedy television program Saturday Night Live, featuring Jim Henson's Muppets. Prior to his work for children on Sesame Street, Henson had created puppetry work, including his show Sam and Friends, for adult audiences. His characters appeared regularly on the late-night comedy television programs, and <b>The</b> <b>Ed</b> Sullivan Show. After Sesame Street, Henson feared he would become typecast into working on children's television series. His talent agent Bernie Brillstein, who represented Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi, helped him transition to Saturday Night Live.|$|E

5000|$|In [...] "Nightmare on Ed Street", Jimmy's toy rabbit, Mr. Yum Yum, {{is trapped}} {{on the window}} sill of the old {{abandoned}} house. Since Jimmy is too frightened to go inside himself, Eddy promises to retrieve it for a quarter. Jimmy refuses to pay Eddy, saying he will pay him when he gets Mr. Yum Yum back in one piece. Inside the house, Eddy reveals to Edd that he told Ed to steal Jimmy's rabbit so Jimmy would pay them to get it back, but Ed tells Eddy that he put Mr. Yum Yum on the mantel, not the window sill. Suddenly, the Kanker sisters appear, holding Mr. Yum Yum and threatening to cut Mr. Yum Yum with a spinning saw. After the Kankers make flirtatious advances towards <b>the</b> <b>Eds,</b> they agree to trade Mr. Yum Yum with <b>the</b> <b>Eds</b> in exchange for giving them [...] "good boyfriend presents" [...] without any kisses. After exploring around the abandoned house, <b>the</b> <b>Eds</b> bring <b>the</b> Kankers their presents (a ship in a bottle for Lee, a can of axle grease for Marie, and a taxidermy book for May) and disable the saw.

40|$|Objective: We {{sought to}} {{examine the effect of}} {{exposure}} to an ambient environment in a pediatric emergency department. We hypothesized that passive distraction from ambient lighting in an emer-gency department would lead to reduction in patient pain and anxiety and increased caregiver satis-faction with services. Background: Passive distraction has been associated with lower anxiety and pain in patients and affects perception of wait time. A pediatric ED was designed that optimized passive distraction techniques using colorful ambient lighting. Methods: Participants were nonrandomly assigned to either an ambient ED environment or a traditional ED environment. Entry and exit questionnaires assessed caregiver expectations and experiences. Pain ratings were obtained with age-appropriate scales, and wait times were recorded. Results: A total of 70 participants were assessed across conditions, that is, 40 in <b>the</b> ambient <b>ED</b> group and 30 in <b>the</b> traditional <b>ED</b> group. Caregivers in <b>the</b> traditional <b>ED</b> group expected a longer wait, had higher anxiety pretreatment, and felt more scared than those in <b>the</b> ambient <b>ED</b> group. Caregivers in <b>the</b> ambient <b>ED</b> group felt more included in the care of their child and rated quality of care higher than caregivers in <b>the</b> traditional <b>ED</b> group. Pain ratings and administrations of pain medication were lower in <b>the</b> ambient <b>ED</b> group. Conclusions: Mean scores for <b>the</b> ambient <b>ED</b> group were in the expected direction on several items measuring satis-faction with ED experiences. Results were suggestive of less stress in caregivers, less pain in patients, and higher satisfaction levels in <b>the</b> ambient <b>ED</b> group...|$|R
