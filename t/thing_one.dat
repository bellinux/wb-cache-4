5|$|The Cat in the Hat is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Theodor Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss and first published in 1957. The story centers on a tall anthropomorphic cat, who wears a red and white-striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat shows up at the house of Sally and her unnamed brother one rainy day when their mother is away. Ignoring repeated objections from the children's fish, the Cat shows the children a few of his tricks in an attempt to entertain them. In the process he and his companions, <b>Thing</b> <b>One</b> and Thing Two, wreck the house. The children and the fish become more and more alarmed until the Cat produces a machine that he uses to clean everything up. He then says his goodbyes and disappears just before the children's mother walks in.|$|E

He returns to his village, where he again encourages Fist and Broken Leg who unite and travel to the base at Devils Crag. Athos now understands that the villages will disappear because of Overcoming (the process led by the Glorious Helpmates) and wants to prevent this mass murder. Broken Leg does not want Athos to go since he believes Athos will die. In the entire section of the novel, there is almost not a single object iⱱn the forest {{that is not a}} mutable living <b>thing.</b> <b>One</b> can grow clothing from the forest, eat the ground itself as a meal, and so on.|$|E

500|$|Beyond the European continent, folk metal is {{relatively}} rare {{with only a}} few known acts including the aforementioned The Lord Weird Slough Feg and their fellow Americans Agalloch. The latter's music [...] "made for a stark geographical anomaly, since its eclectic, avant-garde folk-metal was the sort of <b>thing</b> <b>one</b> would expect to emerge from Scandinavia -- not Portland, Oregon." [...] Tuatha de Danann is another geographical anomaly with their Celtic metal from Brazil. Moreover there is also Skiltron who play Scottish Celtic Metal who hail from Argentina, Conrad a Folk Metal band from Barbados, The Nine Treasures from China, Orphaned Land from Israel, Myrath from Tunisia, Tengger Cavalry from Mongolia.|$|E
500|$|In 1918, Walter A. Briscoe and H. Russell Stannard {{released}} a seminal biography, Captain Ball VC, reprinting many of Ball's letters and prefaced with encomiums by Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, and Major General Sir Hugh Trenchard. Lloyd George wrote that [...] "What {{he says in}} one of his letters, 'I hate this game, but it is the only <b>thing</b> <b>one</b> must do just now', represents, I believe, the conviction of those vast armies who, realising what is at stake, have risked all and endured all that liberty may be saved". Haig spoke of Ball's [...] "unrivalled courage" [...] and his [...] "example and incentive to those who have taken up his work". [...] In Trenchard's opinion, Ball had [...] "a wonderfully well-balanced brain, and his loss to the Flying Corps was the greatest loss it could sustain at that time".|$|E
500|$|Some {{prominent}} critics wrote negative reviews. In his 1941 {{review for}} Sur, Jorge Luis Borges famously called the film [...] "a labyrinth with no center" [...] and predicted that its legacy {{would be a}} film [...] "whose historical value is undeniable but which no one cares to see again." [...] The Argus Weekend Magazine critic Erle Cox called the film [...] "amazing" [...] but thought that Welles's break with Hollywood traditions was [...] "overdone." [...] Tatlers James Agate called it [...] "the well-intentioned, muddled, amateurish <b>thing</b> <b>one</b> expects from high-brows" [...] and [...] "a quite good film which tries to run the psychological essay in harness with your detective thriller, and doesn't quite succeed." [...] Eileen Creelman of The New York Sun called it [...] "a cold picture, unemotional, a puzzle rather than a drama". Other people who disliked the film were W. H. Auden and James Agee.|$|E

[...] She opined that [...] "Hurricane" [...] was [...] "the best representation of a steadfast performance" [...] and commented that the album [...] "lends the opportunity for a tranquil and calm display of their abilities and more importantly, their hearts."

500|$|At {{around that}} time, Filitti issued at his expense the Germanophile {{brochure}} Cu Tripla Alianță ("With the Triple Alliance"). He prudently signed {{it with the}} fake initials F. K. In it, Filitti spoke out at length about containing Pan-Slavism, more important a priority than [...] "the nation's other aspirations" [...] (in Transylvania): [...] "The best <b>thing</b> <b>one</b> may wish upon Romania is that the Muscovite Empire be evicted {{as far away as}} possible from the heart of Europe." [...] The pamphlet was also noted for its unfulfilled prophecy that Italy would also join the war as a German ally, and for arguing that, either way, Austria-Hungary was set to collapse after the war. The text's reception, he noted, was disastrous: no reviews were printed, almost no bookstores would sell it, and the few who looked over it attributed it to an agent of influence or to some [...] "paid-off Jew". In Cu Tripla Alianță and in his diary, the diplomat continued to complain that the Francophile mood was irrational, since France and the Entente as a whole only [...] "love [...] when they need us", which was [...] "only natural". In the same vein, his diary documents earlier instances where (he argued) France had gambled with Romania's independence.|$|E
500|$|The Cat {{brings in}} a big red box from outside, from which he {{releases}} two identical creatures with blue hair and red suits called <b>Thing</b> <b>One</b> and Thing Two. The Things cause more trouble, such as flying kites in the house, knocking pictures {{off the wall and}} picking up the children's mother's new polka-dotted gown. All this comes to an end when the fish spots the children's mother out the window. In response, Sally's brother catches the Things in a net, and the Cat, apparently ashamed, stores them back in the big red box. He takes it out the front door as the fish and the children survey the mess he has made. But the Cat soon returns, riding a machine that picks everything up and cleans the house, delighting the fish and the children. The Cat then leaves just before their mother arrives, and the fish and the children are back where they started {{at the beginning of the}} story. As she steps in, the mother asks the children what they did while she was out, but the children are hesitant and do not answer. The story ends with the question, [...] "What would you do if your mother asked you?" ...|$|E

500|$|Button, Barrichello, Kubica, Sutil, Buemi, de la Rosa, Petrov, Liuzzi, and Hülkenberg {{were all}} issued with five second-time {{penalties}} by the stewards for exceeding the safety car-in lap time. The finishing positions of Button, Barrichello, Kubica, Sutil and Liuzzi were unchanged, but the penalty issued to Buemi moved him from seventh to ninth, allowing Alonso to finish eighth. Rosberg inherited tenth position as de la Rosa moved to twelfth {{in the final}} race classification. Glock was awarded a 20-second time penalty for failing to observe blue flags. Ninth-place finisher Alonso criticised the race stewards, and felt the race had been fixed after they took longer than expected to issue Hamilton's penalty. The Vice-President of Ferrari, Piero Ferrari stated that he was [...] "incredulous and bitter, not just for Ferrari, but for the sport as a whole, as {{this is not the}} sort of <b>thing</b> <b>one</b> expects from professionals." [...] Other teams – including Red Bull, Lotus and McLaren – rejected Alonso's accusations, with Lotus' technical director Mike Gascoyne stating [...] "changing the safety car regulations had opened up a set of scenarios that had never been anticipated before. Hamilton passing the safety car is the only recorded example of a driver doing so in the modern era of Formula One." [...] Ferrari subsequently argued for a change of safety car rules to prevent a similar situation reoccurring.|$|E
