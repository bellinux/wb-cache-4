5|$|Before the {{publication}} of Industrial Society and Its Future, Ted Kaczynski's brother, David Kaczynski, was encouraged by his wife Linda {{to follow up on}} suspicions that Ted was the Unabomber. David was at first dismissive, but began to take the likelihood more seriously after reading the manifesto a week after it was published in September 1995. He browsed through old family papers and found letters dating back to the 1970s written by Ted and sent to newspapers protesting the abuses of technology and which contained phrasing similar to <b>that</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Industrial Society and Its Future.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{providing}} locomotion {{opportunities for}} winged animals and {{a conduit for}} the dispersal of pollen grains, spores and seeds, the atmosphere can {{be considered to be}} a habitat in its own right. There are metabolically active microbes present that actively reproduce and spend their whole existence airborne, with hundreds of thousands of individual organisms estimated to be present in a cubic metre of air. The airborne microbial community may be as diverse as <b>that</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> soil or other terrestrial environments, however these organisms are not evenly distributed, their densities varying spatially with altitude and environmental conditions. Aerobiology has been little studied, but there is evidence of nitrogen fixation in clouds, and less clear evidence of carbon cycling, both facilitated by microbial activity.|$|E
5|$|Complement, an {{important}} component for serology, was first isolated from {{the blood of the}} guinea pig. Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies. Present at a level 10 times <b>that</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> other mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by growth hormone. Additionally, guinea pigs have been identified as model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of pre-eclampsia in human females. Their placental structure {{is similar to that of}} humans, and their gestation period can be divided into trimesters that resemble the stages of fetal development in humans.|$|E
5|$|Halley is {{the most}} active of all the {{periodic}} comets, with others, such as Comet Encke and Comet Holmes, being one or two orders of magnitude less active. Its day side (the side facing the Sun) is far more active than the night side. Spacecraft observations showed that the gases ejected from the nucleus were 80% water vapor, 17% carbon monoxide and 3–4% carbon dioxide, with traces of hydrocarbons although more-recent sources give a value of 10% for carbon monoxide and also include traces of methane and ammonia. The dust particles {{were found to be}} primarily a mixture of carbon–hydrogen–oxygen–nitrogen (CHON) compounds common in the outer Solar System, and silicates, such as are found in terrestrial rocks. The dust particles decreased in size down to the limits of detection (~0.001µm). The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the water released by Halley was initially thought to be similar to <b>that</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Earth's ocean water, suggesting that Halley-type comets may have delivered water to Earth in the distant past. Subsequent observations showed Halley's deuterium ratio to be far higher than <b>that</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Earth's oceans, making such comets unlikely sources for Earth's water.|$|E

5|$|Hawaiian eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named after the Hawaiian volcanoes with which this eruptive type is hallmark. Hawaiian eruptions are the calmest types {{of volcanic}} events, characterized by the effusive eruption of very fluid basalt-type lavas with low gaseous content. The volume of ejected material from Hawaiian eruptions {{is less than half}} of <b>that</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> other eruptive types. Steady production of small amounts of lava builds up the large, broad form of a shield volcano. Eruptions are not centralized at the main summit as with other volcanic types, and often occur at vents around the summit and from fissure vents radiating out of the center.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of Borduria {{was based on}} Eastern Bloc countries. Their police force was modelled on the Soviet KGB. Hergé named the political leader of Borduria Plekszy-Gladz, a pun on plexiglas, although the English translators renamed him Kûrvi-Tasch ("curvy tash"), {{a reference to the}} fact that the leader's curved moustache, inspired by that of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, was a prominent symbol in Borduria. As evidence for the accuracy of Hergé's {{depiction of}} an Eastern Bloc city, Farr highlighted that Borduria's Kûrvi-Tasch Platz closely resembled East Berlin's Platz der Republik, which would only be completed in the 1970s. All of the furniture in the Bordurian police headquarters was drawn from <b>that</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the Studios Hergé premises.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is, in several ways, very similar to globular clusters. The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number to <b>that</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> globular clusters. The clusters share other characteristics with globular clusters such as stellar populations and metallicity. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters. Parametrically, these clusters lie somewhere between a globular cluster and a dwarf spheroidal galaxy.|$|E

It was unlikely that the illiterate sisters would have been able to acquire arsenic through the usual method of visiting a chemist, a route more open to doctors than spinsters. Eventually it was discovered that common flypaper at the time contained arsenic, and that by soaking the flypaper in water, a solution substantially identical – including the same adulterants – to <b>that</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> a bottle at the Higgins residence could be obtained.|$|E

5|$|Like most shooter games, first-person {{shooters}} involve an avatar, {{one or more}} ranged weapons, and a varying {{number of}} enemies. Because they {{take place in a}} 3D environment, these games tend to be somewhat more realistic than 2D shooter games, and have more accurate representations of gravity, lighting, sound and collisions. First-person shooters played on personal computers are most often controlled with a combination of a keyboard and mouse. This system has been claimed as superior to <b>that</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> console games, which frequently use two analog sticks: one used for running and sidestepping, the other for looking and aiming. It is common to display the character's hands and weaponry in the main view, with a head-up display showing health, ammunition and location details. Often, it is possible to overlay a map of the surrounding area.|$|E

5|$|Lilioid monocots (lilioids, liliid monocots, petaloid monocots, petaloid lilioid monocots) is an {{informal}} name {{used for a}} grade (grouping of taxa with common characteristics) of five monocot orders (Petrosaviales, Dioscoreales, Pandanales, Liliales and Asparagales) in which the majority of species have flowers with relatively large, coloured tepals. This characteristic is similar to <b>that</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> lilies ("lily-like"). Petaloid monocots refers to the flowers having tepals which all resemble petals (petaloid). The taxonomic terms Lilianae or Liliiflorae have also been applied to this assemblage at various times. From {{the early nineteenth century}} many of the species in this group of plants were put into a very broadly defined family, Liliaceae sensu lato or s.l. (lily family). These classification systems are still found in many books and other sources. Within the monocots the Liliaceae s.l. were distinguished from the Glumaceae.|$|E
5|$|Neon's {{abundance}} {{in the universe}} is about 1 part in 750; in the Sun and presumably in the proto-solar system nebula, about 1 part in 600. The Galileo spacecraft atmospheric entry probe found {{that even in the}} upper atmosphere of Jupiter, the abundance of neon is reduced (depleted) by about a factor of 10, to a level of 1 part in 6,000 by mass. This may indicate that even the ice-planetesimals which brought neon into Jupiter from the outer solar system, formed in a region which was too warm to retain the neon atmospheric component (abundances of heavier inert gases on Jupiter are several times <b>that</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the Sun).|$|E
