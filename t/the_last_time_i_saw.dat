500|$|Anime News Network {{had four}} editors review {{the first episode}} of the anime: Carl Kimlinger saw {{potential}} in its take on a typical anime premise, praising Tatsuya as the lead protagonist and its handling of mysteries surrounding the plot; Theron Martin, although hopeful because of its male lead and plot concept, expressed criticism towards the indistinguishable animation and constant exposition for the viewers; and Rebecca Silverman {{felt that it was}} bland and nothing special. The fourth reviewer, Hope Chapman, expressed immediate dislike towards the series, criticizing it for lacking anything to engage the viewers and for being a lazy adaptation of a light novel, and concluding the review with [...] "I can't even remember <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> something with not a single redeeming factor or thing to recommend about it at all." [...] Silverman reviewed the series future episodes. Plotwise, she praised the Enrollment Arcs underline on standardized testing, criticized the Nine Schools Competition Arc for its execution and weak exposition, and felt the characters were uninteresting. Silverman felt the series doesn't live up to its potential and cited the background music and stilted animations as possible reasons.|$|E
500|$|At Salon.com, Joyce Millman writes, [...] "there hasn't been a finer hour {{of drama}} on TV {{this year than}} ... 'The Body' ... You have {{to hand it to}} the writers; Joyce's demise came as a {{complete}} surprise. In that instant, Buffy's childhood officially ends. Even if Buffy gets stiffed in every other Emmy category this year, 'The Body' should convince the nominating committee that Gellar is for real ... I can't remember <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a more wrenching portrayal of the shock of loss." [...] Andrew Gilstrap at PopMatters declares it [...] "possibly the finest hour of television I've seen, bar none... It is an incredibly moving episode, one that finally admits that you don't walk away from death unscathed. It also shows that, for all the group's slaying experience, they really weren't prepared for death when it stole a loved one." [...] Gilstrap went on to say the series did not again address death and grief of this magnitude until, in another shocking turn of events, Tara dies of a stray gunshot in the sixth season. Jerry McCormick in The San Diego Union-Tribune agrees, rating Joyce's death as having the same emotional impact as Tara's in [...] "Seeing Red", both of which he listed as the saddest in the series.|$|E
500|$|Billy Vaughn covered [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] on his 1967 Ode to Billy Joe {{instrumental}} album, as did Dean Martin on his 1970 album My Woman, My Woman, My Wife. Glen Campbell's version {{appeared on}} his 1971 album <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> Her, Eddy Arnold's on his 1972 album Lonely People, and George Strait's on his 1992 album Holding My Own. Steagall performed it with Reba McEntire on his 2007 Here We Go Again album, {{but she did}} not include it on her 2007 duets album , which was released four weeks later. Their collaboration was favorably reviewed, and McEntire was said to reinvigorate this country standard by Nathalie Baret of ABQ Journal. Martin's version was 3:07, and it later appeared on compilation albums, starting with the 1996 Dean Martin Gold, Vol. 2. It has appeared on a handful of other Martin compilation albums. Campbell's version was only 2:26. Strait's version is 2:53 and appears later on his 2004 Greatest Collection at a 2:55 length. Steagall's version with McEntire (who Steagall discovered at a 1974 county fair) is 3:10. R and boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield recorded a version for his 1997 album The Red One.|$|E

500|$|Media {{portrayals of}} Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen {{relationships}} were varied and conflicting. Watts {{said of the}} filming of the scene, [...] "I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it, I actually had {{tears in my eyes}} because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit." [...] However, in another interview Watts stated, [...] "I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [...] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, {{from the bottom of my}} heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [...] Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians." [...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do." ...|$|E
500|$|The 3rd Battalion began {{landing on}} Gavutu at 10:00 on 8 August and {{assisted}} in destroying the remaining Japanese defenses on that islet, which {{was completed by}} 12:00. Then the 3rd Battalion prepared to assault Tanambogo. The Marines on Gavutu provided covering fire for the attack. In preparation for the assault, U.S. carrier-based dive bombers and naval gunfire bombardment were requested. After the carrier aircraft twice accidentally dropped bombs on the U.S. Marines on Gavutu, killing four of them, further carrier aircraft support was canceled. San Juan, however, placed its shells on the correct island and shelled Tanambogo for 30 minutes. The Marine assault began at 16:15, both by landing craft and across the causeway, and, with assistance from two marine Stuart light tanks, began making headway against the Japanese defenses. One of the tanks which became stuck on a stump and isolated from its infantry support {{was surrounded by a}} [...] "frenzied mob" [...] of about 50 Japanese airmen. [...] The Japanese set fire to the tank, killing two of its crew and severely beat the other two crewmembers before most of them were killed by Marine rifle fire. The Marines later counted 42 Japanese bodies around the burned-out hulk of the tank, including the corpses of the Yokohama executive officer and several of the seaplane pilots. One of the Japanese survivors of the attack on the tank reported, [...] "I recall seeing my officer, Lieutenant Commander Saburo Katsuta of the Yokohama Air Group, on top of the tank. This was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him". The overall commander of troops on Tanambogo was Captain (naval rank) Miyazaki-san who blew himself up inside his dugout on the late afternoon of 8 August.|$|E

2500|$|In 1940 Lester Cowan, an {{independent}} film producer, bought F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story, [...] "Babylon Revisited and Other Stories" [...] for $80, {{which was a}} bargain. Fitzgerald thought his screenwriting days were over and with some hesitation accepted Cowan's offer to write the screenplay titled [...] "Cosmopolitan" [...] based on the short story. After finishing the screenplay, Scott was told by Cowan {{that he would not}} do the film unless Shirley Temple starred in the lead of the youngster Honoria. Fitzgerald objected, saying that at age 12, going on twenty, the actress was too worldly for the part and would detract from the aura of innocence otherwise framed by Honoria's character. After meeting Shirley in July, Fitzgerald changed his mind and tried to persuade her mother to let her star in the film. However, her mother demurred. In any case, the Cowan project was shelved by the producer. F. Scott Fitzgerald was later credited {{with the use of the}} original story for <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> Paris starring Elizabeth Taylor.|$|E
2500|$|The war {{energised}} Churchill, who was 65 {{years old}} when he became Prime Minister. An American journalist wrote in 1941: [...] "The responsibilities which are his now must be greater than those carried by any other human being on earth. One would think such a weight would have a crushing effect upon him. Not at all. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him, while the Battle of Britain was still raging, he looked twenty years younger than before the war began... His uplifted spirit is transmitted to the people". Churchill's speeches were a great inspiration to the embattled British. His first as prime minister was the famous, [...] "I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat" [...] speech. One historian has called its effect on Parliament as [...] "electrifying". The House of Commons that had ignored him during the 1930s [...] "was now listening, and cheering". Churchill followed that closely with two other equally famous ones, given just before the Battle of Britain. One included the words: ...|$|E
2500|$|Groucho {{maintained}} his irrepressible {{sense of humor}} to the very end, however. [...] George Fenneman, his radio and TV announcer, good-natured foil, and lifelong friend, often related a story {{of one of his}} final visits to Groucho's home: When the time came to end the visit, Fenneman lifted Groucho from his wheelchair, put his arms around his torso, and began to [...] "walk" [...] the frail comedian backwards across the room towards his bed. As he did, he heard a weak voice in his ear: [...] "Fenneman," [...] whispered Groucho, [...] "you always were a lousy dancer." [...] When a nurse approached him with a thermometer during his final hospitalization, explaining that she wanted to see if he had a temperature, he responded, [...] "Don't be silly—everybody has a temperature." [...] Actor Elliott Gould recalled a similar incident: [...] "I recall <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Groucho, he was in the hospital, and he had tubes in his nose and what have you," [...] he said. [...] "And when he saw me, he was weak, but he was there; and he put his fingers on the tubes and played them like it was a clarinet. Groucho played the tubes for me, which brings me to tears." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reportedly, Crumb filed {{a lawsuit}} to have his name removed from the film's credits. San Francisco {{copyright}} attorney Albert L. Morse said that no suit was filed, but an agreement was reached to remove Crumb's name from the credits. However, Crumb's name has remained in the final film since its original theatrical release. [...] In response to his distaste for the film, Crumb had [...] "Fritz the Cat—Superstar" [...] published in People's Comics later in 1972, in which a jealous girlfriend kills Fritz with an icepick; he has refused to use the character again. and wrote the filmmakers a letter saying not to use his characters in their films. [...] Crumb later cited [...] the film as [...] "one of those experiences I sort of block out. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it was when I was making an appearance at a German art school in the mid-1980s, and I was forced to watch it with the students.
