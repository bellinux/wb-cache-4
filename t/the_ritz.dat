5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ritz</b> Club, {{owned by}} the owners of <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> Hotel since 1998, is a casino in the {{basement}} of the hotel, occupying the space which was formerly <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> Bar and Grill. It offers roulette, black jack, baccarat, and poker, as well as some slot machines.|$|E
5|$|Due to Zog's {{concerns}} about safety during air raids, the ladies' cloakroom was {{converted into a}} private shelter for the Albanians. Following an air raid, when a bomb fell between <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> and the Berkeley in Piccadilly, shattering glass in <b>the</b> <b>Ritz,</b> most of the Albanian royal family moved to Chelsea, but Zog remained until the spring of 1941 until he was offered Lord Parmoor's house in Buckinghamshire. In total, <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> was damaged nine times during bombing raids, and the Restaurant had to be closed twice.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{the hotel}} {{fell into a}} {{turbulent}} period. Terrorist threats from the Irish Republican Army became the chief concern, and bomb scares were not uncommon. The oil crisis in the early 1970s directly affected business and prompted the Bracewell-Smith family to sell their stake to Trafalgar House on 5 April 1976 for £2.75m. At {{the time of the}} sale, the hotel's occupancy rate was just 45 percent; <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> Grill Room had been closed and it had lost quite a bit of money in recent times. In 1984, <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> brought back its weekly Sunday tea dances which were popular during the 1920s and 1930s. Because of demand, the hotel considered restricting afternoon tea at <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> to hotel guests only, as those staying at <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> were often unable to get a table. Many Londoners who would have been barred by this restriction voiced disapproval and <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> compromised by requiring reservations for afternoon tea at the hotel. Proper attire for tea is a must; <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> once refused to admit Mick Jagger for tea because he was not wearing a jacket and tie.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>the</b> Von <b>Ritz</b> was {{selected}} as the new name for the Crump Theatre, many in the community felt it wrong to cast aside the name of the theater's founder. Thus, <b>the</b> Von <b>Ritz</b> was never used.|$|R

5|$|The {{hotel was}} opened by Swiss hotelier César Ritz in May 1906, {{eight years after}} he {{established}} the Hôtel Ritz Paris. After a weak beginning, the hotel began to gain popularity {{towards the end of}} World War I, and became popular with politicians, socialites, writers and actors of the day in particular. David Lloyd George held a number of secret meetings at <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> during {{the latter half of the}} war, and it was at <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> that he made the decision to intervene on behalf of Greece against Turkey. Noël Coward was a notable diner at <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{the club}} was {{purchased}} by London Clubs, who moved their premises from the Devonshire Club on St James's Street to the basement of <b>the</b> <b>Ritz.</b> A new company was formed in June 1998, <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> Hotel Casino Ltd., which was granted legal permission to open a casino. After very quick refurbishment, it reopened on 12 September with exclusive membership, although members are permitted to invite a guest. As of 2006 <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> Club was divided into four main areas—the restaurant, bar, lounge and the private gaming room, situated in the former Banqueting Hall. In July 2014, London High Court heard a case against the club, in which Nora Al-Daher claimed she was 'taken advantage' of and asked for £2 million in losses.|$|E

50|$|The {{brothers}} {{had a large}} following, and some fans compare them to the Marx Brothers, but <b>the</b> <b>Ritzes</b> did not play contrasting characters like the Marxes did; <b>the</b> boisterous <b>Ritzes</b> frequently behaved identically, {{making it harder for}} audiences to tell them apart. The ringleader was always rubber-faced, mouthy Harry, with Jimmy and Al enthusiastically following his lead. They frequently broke into songs and dances during their feature comedies, and often did celebrity impersonations (among them Ted Lewis, Peter Lorre, Tony Martin, even Alice Faye and Katharine Hepburn).|$|R

5|$|Many {{novels of}} the Lost Generation feature scenes in <b>the</b> <b>Ritz,</b> such as F. Scott Fitzgerald's Tender Is The Night and Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. Noël Coward's play Semi-Monde {{is perhaps the}} most notable work {{covering}} the hotel in detail, following the escapades of an extravagant, promiscuous fictional Paris elite between 1924 and 1926. In the Bret Easton Ellis novel Glamorama, a group of supermodels turned terrorists plant a home-made bomb in <b>the</b> <b>Ritz,</b> resulting in its destruction. In The Da Vinci Code, the protagonist, Robert Langdon, stays at the hotel while in Paris, as do Andrea Sachs and Miranda Priestly in Lauren Weisberger's The Devil Wears Prada. The final chapter of Ian Fleming's James Bond novel From Russia, with Love is set at the hotel. The villain, Rosa Klebb, stays in room 602 and engages in a battle with Bond which results in her death. In Julian Fellowes' novel Snobs (2004), those attending Earl Broughton's pre-marriage bachelor party are accommodated at <b>the</b> <b>Ritz.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 4 August 1914, Lady Diana Cooper's future husband, Duff Cooper, then a Foreign Office official, dined at <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> {{with the}} Earl of Essex and his American wife, Adele Capell (née Grant) and Patrick Shaw-Stewart, and {{later that day}} {{announced}} that World War I had broken out to the party. Before the war began, the German and Austrian embassies both retained tables at <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> Restaurant. The hotel suffered during the war, and lost nearly £50,000 in 1915 alone; the ballroom was usually empty and lights went out by 10pm, but rooms were still in demand and the hoteliers believed it to be worth keeping open. Socialites such as Lady Cynthia Asquith, daughter-in-law of H. H. Asquith and Lord Basil Blackwood were documented in her diaries to have dined at <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> {{in the spring of}} 1916. The following year, she held a lavish dinner party with the likes of Osbert Sitwell, Gilbert Russell and Maud Nelke and Clare Tennant.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 2012, <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> {{closed for}} the first time in its history for an {{extensive}} restoration. It was scheduled to reopen in late 2015, but this date was later changed to March 2016. At 07:00 local time on 19 January 2016, a major fire broke out in the roof of the building. Fifteen fire engines and 60 firefighters attended. <b>The</b> <b>Ritz</b> reopened on 6 June 2016 after a major four-year, multimillion-dollar renovation.|$|E
50|$|It is {{most famous}} for its {{football}} club, <b>the</b> SC <b>Ritzing.</b> <b>The</b> Arsenal FC football team played a Burgenland XI in the town, on Monday, July 28, 2008, and beat the team 10-2, with Arsenal scoring 7 goals before half time.|$|R

5|$|In {{recent years}} <b>the</b> <b>Ritz</b> has taken {{measures}} to enforce their trademark against infringement. Lawyers have notified competitors {{using the name}} to surrender their websites and Facebook accounts marketing under the trademark, {{even though they had}} been using these names for many years. The Desborough Ritz, which had been using the name since the 1930s, changed its name in 2012 after being advised by solicitors to do so. That same year, a Northamptonshire wedding location named <b>The</b> <b>Ritz</b> changed its name to the Banqueting & Conference Suites at the Kettering Ritz after another notification. The Brighouse Ritz, which has operated under the name since 1938, was notified in 2017 to change its name or face legal action.|$|E
