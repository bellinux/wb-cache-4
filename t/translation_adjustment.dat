40|$|This paper assesses which {{accounting}} disclosures {{are most}} useful in valuing firms with foreign {{operations in the}} presence of exchange rate movements. Our analytical model indicates that a valuation of these firms requires disaggregating cash flows into current unexpected cash flows in the parent currency, current unexpected cash flows in the foreign currency, the persistent component of previous unexpected foreign currency cash flows, and the permanent return on foreign currency operating capital. We next show that to value these firms using aggregate cash flows or earnings requires addi-tionally, at a minimum, knowledge of permanent foreign currency operating cash flows. Intuitively, the sign on the latter measures whether the firm is a net producer or a net seller in the foreign currency, which explains whether the firm incurs an economic gain or loss as a result of foreign exchange moves. We then extend our analysis to explain why the value relevance of changes in the <b>translation</b> <b>adjustment</b> mandated under the current rate method is indeterminate, and demonstrate that, when we condition the <b>translation</b> <b>adjustment</b> on the sign of the permanent operating cash flows in the foreig...|$|E

40|$|A {{common problem}} in {{clinical}} MRI is anatomic misalignment of imaging slices across successive examinations. This unnecessarily complicates the radiologic assessment of anatomic {{change over time}} on serial MRI studies. To address this problem, spherical navigator echoes, which can detect rigid body motion in all {{six degrees of freedom}}, were used to guide spatial location and orientation adjustments to an exam prescription to match the reference frame of images acquired in an earlier exam. An initial linear navigator echo is also necessary to effect coarse Z <b>translation</b> <b>adjustments</b> prior to fine six degrees of freedom adjustment with a spherical navigator echo. Results of this technique are presented for head image volumes of five volunteers. Each volunteer was imaged on two scanners.

40|$|In {{line with}} the growing {{interest}} in the social constructivist approach to translation education, this article proposes that the task-based teaching (TBT), a method initiated and popularized in second language teaching, should be adopted {{in the teaching of}} business translation, a course popular among translation students who aspire to become professional translators. However, given the considerable differences between teaching a second language and teaching (business) <b>translation,</b> <b>adjustments</b> will have to be made to the TBT methodology to enable its application in the context of translator training (Gonzalez Davis, 2004). It is proposed in this article that a task cycle in teaching translation consists of six stages, including pretask, task, convening, analysis, revising and reflection. While the adoption of TBT may pose challenges for translation teachers and students, the advantages outweigh them to a great extent by 1) shifting the focus from teaching to learning, 2) drawing students’ attention to the translation process, 3) developing a reflective practice among students, and 4) most important of all, activating and developing all the sub-competencies of the translation competence, which is the ultimate goal of all translation training programmes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the foreign currency translation adjustments and the firm’s market value of the Australia-based oil and gas multinational companies. The translation accounting under the former standard AASB 1012 “Foreign Currency Translation ” and the current standard AASB 121 “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates ” produces different <b>translation</b> <b>adjustment</b> results. This study empirically examines this relationship and finds that the translation adjustments under the former standard AASB 1012 provide information that is opposite to the economic effects of the exchange rate changes. Also, this study uses a case study approach to examine the effect of the new standard AASB 121 on the market value of the oil and gas firms.

40|$|This paper[1] empirically {{examines}} the accounting {{and the economic}} effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on {{the oil and gas}} industry under the former and the current translation accounting standards in Australia. Due to the unique features of {{the oil and gas industry}} and based on an analysis of the former standardstralian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) 1012, the authors predict that a positive <b>translation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (the accounting effect) is associated with a loss, instead of a creation of the firm value (the economic effect) under AASB 1012. The authors also predict that the new standard AASB 121, adapted from the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 21 with modifications, will report translation adjustments that are consistent with the economic effects. By using Australia-based multinational oil and gas firms, the authors find that translation adjustments under AASB 1012 are inversely associated with firm value and that the relationship changes to a positive one under AASB 121. This study concludes that the new standard has the potential to improve the quality of the translation accounting information.

The disease continues to spread in new ecological niches {{and there is an}} urgent need to develop strategies for its control. The high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is well known to respond to changes in external osmolarity. HOG pathway activation leads to phosphorylation, activation and nuclear transduction of the HOG 1 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The activated HOG 1 triggers several responses to osmotic stress, including up or down regulation of different genes, regulation of protein <b>translation,</b> <b>adjustments</b> to cell cycle progression and synthesis of osmolyte glycerol. This study investigated the role of the MAPK-encoding PfHog 1 gene on osmotic stress adaptation and virulence of P. fijiensis. RNA interference-mediated gene silencing of PfHog 1 significantly suppressed growth of P. fijiensis on potato dextrose agar media supplemented with 1 M NaCl, indicating that PfHog 1 regulates osmotic stress. In addition, virulence of the PfHog 1 -silenced mutants of P. fijiensis on banana was significantly reduced, as observed from the low rates of necrosis and disease development on the infected leaves. Staining with lacto phenol cotton blue further confirmed the impaired mycelial growth of the PfHog 1 in the infected leaf tissues, which was further confirmed with quantification of the fungal biomass using absolute- quantitative PCR. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PfHog 1 plays a critical role in osmotic stress regulation and virulence of P. fijiensis on its host banana.

40|$|The Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute and the Department of Astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin are {{developing}} a near infrared wide-band high resolution spectrograph, immersion grating infrared spectrometer (IGRINS). The compact white-pupil design of the instrument optics uses seven cryogenic mirrors, including three aspherical off-axis collimators and four flat fold mirrors. In this study, we introduce the optomechanical mount designs of three off-axis collimating mirrors and one flat slit-viewer fold mirror. Two of the off-axis collimators are serving as H and K-band pupil transfer mirrors, and are designed as system alignment compensators {{in combination with the}} H 2 RG focal plane array detectors in each channel. For this reason, the mount designs include tip-tilt and parallel <b>translation</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanisms to properly perform the precision alignment function. This means that the off-axis mirrors’ optomechanical mount designs are among the most sensitive tasks in all IGRINS system hardware. The other flat fold mirror is designed within its very limitedly allowed work space. This slit-viewer fold mirror is mounted with its own version of the six-point kinematic optics mount. The design work consists of a computer-aided 3 D modeling and finite element analysis (FEA) technique to optimize the structural stability and the thermal behavior of the mount models. From the structural and thermal FEA studies, we conclude that the four IGRINS mirror mounts are well designed to meet all optical stability tolerances and system thermal requirements...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the value relevance of foreign currency <b>translation</b> <b>adjustments</b> (FCTAs) in general, and when conditioned {{on the degree}} foreign exposure and whether the value relevance of FCTAs changed pre- and post-Comprehensive Income (CI) reporting in Australia. This study examines a premature aspect of FCTA literature by examining how a firm’s degree of foreign exposure (measured by foreign sales revenue; foreign income (sales revenue plus other income); foreign total assets; foreign non-current and number of foreign segments) may affect the value relevance of FCTAs. Most recently, on the 18 July 2013 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a Discussion Paper {{on the topic of}} reviewing the Conceptual Framework. Despite the fact that the Conceptual Framework does not cover CI, the IASB has raised a specific interest in whether the presentation of information matters, which is precisely one of the issues examined within this study – whether the value relevance of FCTAs are different when presented in the Statement of Changes in Equity and/or notes, of in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. This is the first study conducted from the Australian perspective. The results reveal that there is inconsistent evidence as to whether FCTAs are value relevant for the sample and time period examined. FCTAs are negatively however insignificantly associated with share price in the pooled regression (2006 to 2012). The results support the hypothesis that FCTAs are value relevant when presented on the SCI, due to the more salient display of the FCTA figure. There is limited evidence supporting the hypothesis that FCTAs are more value relevance for firms when higher foreign exposure as measured by the various proxies...|$|R

40|$|Prior to the {{issuance}} of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 8 (SFAS No. 8), there was a marked inconsistency {{in the area of}} accounting for foreign currency translation. Though designed to make the diverse accounting practices of multinational corporations (MNCs) more compatible, SFAS No. 8 {{was the subject of a}} great deal of criticism, eventually leading to {{the issuance}} of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 52 (SFAS No. 52). SFAS No. 52 differs from SFAS No. 8 on objectives and method of translation, and on accounting treatments of <b>translation</b> <b>adjustments.</b> This dissertation provides an empirical examination of the security market reaction to the accounting policy change embodied in SFAS No. 52, and its impact on the volatility of reported earnings of MNCs. The effects of the issuance and early adoption of SFAS No. 52 on security return distributions were determined by both cross-sectional comparisons of cumulative average residuals (CAR) between MNCs and domestic firms and between early and late adopters, and by time-series tests on CAR of MNCs. Two volume analyses were performed to test the effects of SFAS No. 52 on security volume. The first analysis was adjusted to remove the effects of the marketwide factors on volume, and the second analysis was unadjusted for the market influences. Four nonparametric tests were used in testing the effects of SFAS No. 52 vis-a-vis SFAS No. 8 on the volatility of reported earnings of MNCs. The findings of this study led to the following conclusions: (1) SFAS No. 52 had significantly affected security returns of MNCs, but had no significant effects on security volume of MNCs; (2) the early adoption of SFAS No. 52 had no effects on security returns and volume of early adopters as opposed to late adopters; and (3) SFAS No. 52 did not have any significant effects on the volatility of reported earnings of MNCs.

40|$|I {{examine the}} foreign {{currency}} translation exposure and its economic implications. I do this by reviewing the relevant literature on translation exposure and by including an empirical part of my own. I contribute to the extant literature by conducting an empirical study related to translation exposure, using data from Finnish stock-listed firms. The thesis is written as a commissioned work for a case company. In the thesis I show that despite the traditional recommendation of not to hedge translation exposure, many firms still do so. This is explained mainly by market imperfections and by the adverse effect that translation exposure can have on a company's leverage ratios. At the present levels neither the case company's debt-to-equity ratio nor its risk tolerance assigned to translation exposure are being endangered due to the existing exposure. I discuss the special aspects of hedging for translation exposure and notice the challenges {{that are related to}} the time horizon and liquidity effects of hedging it. I reflect on the economic implications of translation exposure and show that the IFRS rules for translating foreign subsidiaries' financial statements do not take into account real changes in exchange rates perfectly. After that, I discuss the differences of translation effect and foreign economic effect, and argue that the two exposures actually have opposing effects under certain conditions. At the end of the thesis I review the extant empirical literature on the value-relevance of translation exposure. The literature generally recognizes a positive association between <b>translation</b> <b>adjustments</b> and changes in firm value, implying that translation effect dominates foreign economic effect. In line with this, I find a positive association using data from Finnish stock-listed firms. I conclude that this is in major part explained by two facts. First, a positive coefficient for translation effect implies improved export-competitiveness for Finnish firms, and second, the sample consists of firms from varying industries. I would like to extend my special thanks to Jyrki Tammivuori and Petteri Kärnä for the important and generous help they provided me with during the process of writing the thesis...|$|R

This paper, which spans the period from Separation in 1859 {{to the middle of}} the twentieth century, begins by looking at the processes of <b>translation</b> and <b>adjustment</b> in first generation Irish immigrant writers and then considers the Irish strain in the work of some prominent Queensland-born writers of Irish descent. Although Queensland was the Australian colony which attracted the highest rate of migration from Ireland in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Irish immigrants were significantly under-represented in literary culture. The Queensland Irish were more integrated, and less active in the nationalist cause, than elsewhere in Australia, and this assimilative, depoliticising tendency is also evident in the work of Queensland writers of Irish birth or descent. The ongoing Irish strain in Queensland literature is attributable largely to second and third generation Irish women writers, who use the glamour of Irishness to redefine the taint of Irish racial inferiority and criminality, and employ Irish faerie mythology as a key component of a modernist literary agenda.

Methods: A multicomponent physical activity intervention programme with three components was developed for the preschool setting based on the psychomotor concept: daily structured physical education lessons for the children provided by the kindergarten teachers, physical activity homework for the child and his/her family, and parental education. The kindergarten teachers were invited to two workshops providing information on {{the background of the}} intervention and practical training for planning and organising the activity lessons. Regular supervision at the kindergartens was implemented. Results: A manual describing the background and the content of the intervention as well as practical examples for physical education lessons was made available to kindergarten teachers. Furthermore, 183 illustrated cards with about 400 exercises and games were generated to plan the physical education lessons. In addition to describing the exercise tasks, their main focus, and possible modifications, the cards summarised the requirements with respect to space, equipment, and staff. This collection of exercises and games suits the needs of preschools of different sizes, and equipment and staff resources. The focus of the given exercises was on fun and cooperation of the participating children while improving coordination skills, perception, and muscle strength, power and endurance abilities. The cards were organised according to the main focus of the exercise. Likewise, 52 homework cards were generated illustrating games and motor tasks for one participant, {{as well as for the}} whole family, and accounting for seasonal requirements. Finally, three seasonal homework cards with further activity games as well as educational material for the parents (focussing, e. g., on the importance of motor abilities and physical activity in preschool children, of healthy nutrition and reduction of media use in childhood) were provided.

The translator's methodology will be examined and evaluated in view of some <b>translation</b> theories. Changes, <b>adjustments,</b> condensations and omissions will be traced, examined, and evaluated by comparing the text of the English translation TL with the Arabic original text SL. The study shows that the translator omitted, from the original text, a significant portion of passages and sentences as well as condensing others. All omitted passages and sentences are listed in the Appendix. He overlooked, in his translation, two main elements of the original novel; the role Wagner's opera the Flying Dutchman and the human sides of the characters. The paper will discuss the effect of this omission and condensation on the TL text. The question of faithfulness of the translation to the SL text, and whether or not it succeeded in conveying the messages of the novel, will be discussed as well.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{translate}} and validate the Swedish version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale – Vanderbilt Cystectomy Index (FACT-VCI). Materials and methods: For adaptation into Swedish, a multiprofessional team was used for <b>translation</b> including cultural <b>adjustment,</b> followed by back-translation. Test and retest in 10 individuals was followed by assessing metric properties in 75 consecutive patients with bladder cancer treated with radical cystectomy. Reliability and internal consistency were measured by Cronbach’s alpha. Face validity was tested with two laypersons and construct validity was tested by correlation to the dimensions in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale – General (FACT-G). Results: The translated Swedish instrument showed validity and reliability similar to the original, and the results were comparable to published studies using FACT-VCI. The correlation between the VCI sum score and FACT-G dimensions was significant in all dimensions and the item-total correlation was over 0. 3; therefore, the construct validity was acceptable. In addition, it was possible to detect differences in separate items in the translated version of FACT-VCI between age groups, type of diversion and those treated with chemotherapy, even though the samples were small.

40|$|Several {{electrophysiological}} {{studies suggest}} that PD patients have a reduced tendency to entrain to regular environmental patterns. Here we investigate whether this reduced entrainment concerns a generalized deficit or is confined to movement-related activity, leaving sensory entrainment intact. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded during a rhythmic auditory target detection task in 14 PD patients and 14 control subjects. Participants were instructed to press a button when hearing a target tone amidst an isochronous sequence of standard tones. The variable pitch of standard tones indicated the probability of the next tone to be a target. In addition, targets were occasionally omitted to evaluate entrainment uncontaminated by stimulus effects. Response times {{were not significantly different}} between groups and both groups benefited equally from the predictive value of standard tones. Analyses of oscillatory beta power over auditory cortices showed equal entrainment to the tones in both groups. By contrast, oscillatory beta power and event-related fields (ERFs) demonstrated a reduced engagement of motor cortical areas in PD patients, expressed in the modulation depth of beta power, in the response to omitted stimuli, and in an absent motor area P 300 effect. Together, these results show equally strong entrainment of neural activity over sensory areas in controls and patients, but, in patients, a deficient <b>translation</b> of the <b>adjustment</b> to the task rhythm to motor circuits. We suggest that the reduced activation does not merely reflect altered resonance to rhythmic external events, but a compromised recruitment of an endogenous response reflecting internal rhythm generation...|$|R
40|$|Our {{survival}} {{depends on}} accurate {{understanding of the}} environment around us through sensory inputs. One way to achieve this is to build models of the surrounding environment {{that are able to}} provide explanations of the data. Statistical models such as PCA, ICA and sparse coding attempt to do so by exploiting the second- and higher-order structures of sensory data. While these models have been shown to reveal key properties of the mammalian sensory system and have been successfully applied in various engineering applications, one shared weakness of these models is that they assume each observation is independent. In reality, there is often a transformational relationship between sensory data observations. Exploiting this relationship allows us to tease apart the causes of the data and reason about the environment. In this thesis, I developed an unsupervised learning framework that attempts to find the translational relationship between data and infer the causes of the observed data. This dissertation is divided into three chapters. First, I propose an unsupervised learning framework that is able to model the transformations between data points using a continuous transformation model. I highlight the difficulties faced by previous attempts using similar models. I overcome these hurdles by proposing a learning rule that is able to compute the learning updates for an exponential model in polynomial time. I also propose an adaptive inference algorithm that is able to avoid local minima. These improvements make learning transformation possible and efficient. Second, I perform a detailed analysis of the proposed model. I show that the adaptive inference algorithm is able to simultaneously recover multiple transformation parameters with high accuracy when given synthetic data where the transformation is known. When learned on pairs of images containing affine transformations, the algorithm correctly recovers the transformation operators. The unsupervised learning algorithm is able to discover transformations such as <b>translation,</b> illumination <b>adjustment,</b> contrast enhancement and local deformations when learned on pairs of natural movie frames. I also show that the learned models provide a better description of the underlying transformation both qualitatively and quantitatively compare to commonly used motion models. Third, I describe a plausible application for the continuous transformation model in video coding. In a hybrid coding scheme, I propose to replace the traditionally used exhaustive search motion model with transformation models learned on natural time-varying images. A detailed analysis of the rate distortion characteristics of different learned models is documented and I show that the learned model improves the performance of traditional motion models in various settings...|$|R

There is little attention to social function {{in the treatment of}} depression. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the validity and reliability of the Persian version of SASS (P-SASS) for older adults. Participants and methods: This is a cross-sectional and methodological study. The participants were 550 community-dwelling older adults living in Tehran who were selected randomly from the primary health care centers. To assess the psychometric properties of SASS, we first did <b>translation</b> and cross-cultural <b>adjustment</b> on SASS and then used P-SASS and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) for gathering data. A number of analyses, including Pearson’s correlation, exploratory factor analysis, and Cronbach’s α, and receiver operating characteristic curve were used to manage the data with the IBM SPSS Statistics V. 22. Results: The mean age of the participants was 66. 09 ± 6. 67  years, and 58. 9 % of them were male. The Cronbach’s α was 0. 97. The test–retest reliability correlation coefficient was 0. 78. Principal component analysis showed that P-SASS consists of two components. P-SASS score showed a significant negative correlation with GDS (r=- 0. 91, P< 0. 01), which suggests good convergent validity. The P-SASS cutoff point was 28 (sensitivity: 0. 97 and specificity: 0. 94). Conclusion: P-SASS has good reliability and validity for older adults. So, it can be considered as an appropriate tool to evaluate the social function and social motivation of older persons with and without depression.

40|$|This {{synoptic}} analysis of verses from Job chapters 37 - 39 in 11 Q 10, the Peshitta version (PJob) and the rabbinic targum (RJob) aims {{to identify the}} translators’ methods for handling the Hebrew text (HT) and to assess the apparent skills and knowledge brought by them to their task. Additionally, the study engages with recent discussion which challenges the nature of 11 Q 10 as targum. To this end, PJob and RJob provide accepted models of ‘translation’ and ‘targum’ alongside which to assess 11 Q 10. The following translation methods are identified, described, compared and contrasted in the three versions: selection,extension, alternative <b>translation,</b> expansion, substitution, <b>adjustment</b> of the consonantal HT, adjustment of the Hebrew word order or division, omission, and conjecture. PJob is confirmed {{as an attempt to}} transpose the difficult Hebrew of Job into Syriac. RJob is confirmed as a conservative translation with clear underpinnings in allusion to scripture and to rabbinic traditions attested elsewhere. Significant observations are made regarding an interpretative quality in 11 Q 10, and new light is cast on its richness and subtlety as an allusive translation. It is proposed that the translation displays deep knowledge of scripture and skill in applying this knowledge. It is further proposed that careful comparison with methods which have been identified in Onqelos is warranted. 11 Q 10 is identified as an important early witness to scripturally-based motifs which are also found in other intertestamental and rabbinic sources. It is argued that 11 Q 10 ’s nature suggests that its purpose was not simply to translate but to understand and subtly explicate the HT, and that it was intended for use alongside it, not as a replacement. The study refutes the categorization of 11 Q 10 as ‘translation’ rather than ‘targum’, and agrees with its orginal editors that its value lies in its unique witness to the early nature of targum.

40|$|The design {{requirements}} and initial design concept for the AXAF-I Science Instrument Module (SIM) were reviewed at Ball on September 29, 1993. The concept design SIM focus mechanism utilizes a planetary gearset, with redundant motors, {{to drive a}} large ring (called 'main housing bearing') via a spur gearset. This large drive ring actuates three tangent bar links (called 'push rods'), which in turn actuate three levers (called 'pin levers'). Each of the three pin levers rotates an 'eccentric pin,' which in turn moves {{the base of a}} bipod flexure in both the radial (normal to optical axis) and axial (focus along optical axis) directions. Three bipod flexures are employed, equally spaced at 120 degrees apart, the base of each being translated in the two directions as described above. A focus adjustment is made by rotating the drive ring, which drives the push rods and therefore the pin levers, which in turn rotate the eccentric pins, finally imparting the two motions to the base of each of the bipod flexures. The axial <b>translation</b> (focus <b>adjustment)</b> of the focused structure is the sum of the direct axial motion plus axial motion which comes from uniformly squeezing the three bipod bases radially inward. SAO documented the following concerns regarding the focus mechanism in memo WAP-FY 94 - 001, dated October 7, 1993 : (1) The focus adjustment depends, in large part, on the structural properties (stiffnesses and end fixities) of the bipod flexures, push rods, pin levers and eccentric pins. If these properties are not matched very well, then lateral translations as well as unwanted rotations of the focussed structure will accompany focus motion. In addition, the stackup of linkage tolerances and any nonuniform wear in the linkages will result in the same unwanted motions. Thermal gradients will also affect these motions. At the review Ball did not present supporting analyses to support their choice of this design concept. (2) The proposed 'primary' method of measuring focus is by counting motor steps. The 'backup' method is by a pot mounted on the drive ring. Neither method provides for a direct measurement of the quantity desired (focus position). This is of concern because of the long and indirect relationship between focus and the sensed quantity (drive ring rotation). There are three sinusoidal relationships and structural stiffness in the path, and the resulting calibration is likely to be highly nonlinear. These methods would require an accurate ground calibration. (3) Ground calibration (and verification) of focus vs. drive position must be done in 1 -g on the ground. This calibration will be complicated by both the structural characteristics of the bipods {{and the fact that the}} CG of the translating portion of the SIM is not on the optical axis (thereby causing unwated rotations and changing the focus position vs. motor step and pot readout relationships). The SIM translating weight could be offloaded, but the calibration then becomes sensitive to any errors in offloading (both magnitude and direction). There are concerns as to whether a calibration to the required accuracy can be accomplished on the ground. (4) The choice of a potentiometer as the focus position sensor is questionable in terms of reliability for a five year mission. The results of SAO's study of items 1, 2 and 3 described above are presented in this report...|$|R
