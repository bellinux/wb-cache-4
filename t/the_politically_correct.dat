25|$|Emanuel was a {{published}} poet, scholar, and critic. As a poet, Emanuel {{published more than}} 300 poems and 13 individual books. Emanuel has been {{called one of the}} best, and most overlooked, poets of his time. Critics have put forward several reasons for Emanuel's poetry being neglected by the larger literary world, including the fact that Emanuel wrote more traditional poetic forms, that he left the United States, {{and the fact that he}} refused to take part in <b>the</b> <b>politically</b> <b>correct</b> world of Black academia.|$|E
500|$|Griffin {{describes}} himself as a [...] "moderniser", and [...] "new nationalist", and after his election as leader of the BNP, according to The Guardian contributor Francis Wheen, was [...] "contemptuous" [...] of the party's traditional supporters. He has changed the BNP's traditional focus on immigration and race, to a defence of what it sees as [...] "our traditional principles against <b>the</b> <b>politically</b> <b>correct</b> agenda" [...] espoused by mainstream politicians. He has portrayed himself as a defender of free speech, and has repeatedly spoken out against multiculturalism. During 2000, he attempted to further the BNP's popular appeal by targeting specific groups, including lorry drivers—some of whom were at the time engaged in mass protests against fuel prices—and farmers. The BNP also produced a journal devoted to rural matters.|$|E
500|$|Todd Gilchrist of IGN wrote a {{positive}} {{review of the}} film, stating that the film is [...] "an almost perfect achievement." [...] Gilchrist also praised how the film revived interest in animation as it was released {{at a time when}} interest in animation was at a lull. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote a mixed review of the film, referring to it as a [...] "likably unspectacular adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen classic." [...] Hinson went on to write that the film is average even at its highest points. He wrote that while {{there is nothing wrong with}} the film, it would be difficult for children to identify with Ariel and that the characters seemed bland. Hinson concluded his review saying that the film is [...] "accomplished but uninspiring, The Little Mermaid has enough to please any kid. All that's missing is the magic." [...] Empire gave {{a positive}} review of the film, stating that [...] " [...] a charmer of a movie, boasting all the ingredients that make a Disney experience something to treasure yet free of all <b>the</b> <b>politically</b> <b>correct,</b> formulaic elements that have bogged down the more recent productions." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{complete}} Coleman material, in {{a collection}} edited by James Booth, was finally published in 2002. [...] Booth thought that the material would probably cause [...] "a huge amount of confusion and smoke because <b>the</b> <b>politically</b> <b>correct</b> brigade will jump on it". Anticipating the publication, Emma Hartley and Vanessa Thorpe in The Observer doubted the literary value of the works, citing [...] Motion's [...] view that the stories were [...] "little more than mild pornography" [...] which the mature poet would never have wished to see published. On publication, Booth's collection provoked a particularly hostile reaction from The Guardians critic Jenny Diski, whose review dismissed the Coleman writings as [...] "drivel" [...] and [...] "sad ramblings", unworthy of publication or critical attention, and not even valid pornography: [...] "Not a breast, not a clitoris is seen or mentioned." [...] Unlike serious pornographers, [...] "Larkin sketches a mere outline and then walks away with a snigger". Diski mocks Booth's reverential descriptions of the typescripts [...] "as though they were slivers of the True Cross", and concludes: [...] "Let this be a lesson, at least, to anyone who hasn't got around to chucking out the crap they wrote in their teens and early twenties." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bawer's book While Europe Slept: How Radical Islam is Destroying the West from Within, {{about the}} threat that the rise of Islam in Europe, in his view, poses to liberal values, {{appeared}} in 2006. Once established in Western European nations, Bawer maintains, Muslims avoid integration and answer only to sharia law, while avoiding the legal systems of their host nations, allowing abuse of women and gays, as well as Jews and other non-Muslims. In his conclusion, Bawer states that rising birthrates among Muslims and their [...] "refusal" [...] to integrate {{will allow them to}} dominate European society within 30 years, and {{that the only way to}} avoid such a disaster is to abolish <b>the</b> <b>politically</b> <b>correct</b> and multicultural doctrines that, according to him, are rife within the continent.|$|E
2500|$|Hopkins {{supported}} Trump's Republican {{presidential nomination}} in the Daily Mail during December: [...] "I hear cries {{that he is}} a blithering idiot. I have often been called a deranged fool. But if this were true you could ignore me, ignore us, [...] the two of us shouting naked at the rain. It's because we articulate sentiments repressed by <b>the</b> <b>politically</b> <b>correct</b> consensus that we have a voice". Hopkins defended his remarks that all Muslims should be banned from entering the United States. Trump thanked Hopkins for her support, calling her a [...] "respected journalist", although the Metropolitan Police and the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson among others, rejected his comments that there are 'no go' areas of London for non-Muslims. Hopkins asserted that Britain is in part [...] "radicalised" [...] and [...] "it does nobody any favours to deny the obvious". When asked by BBC's Daily Politics presenter Andrew Neil in a December 2015 interview to name the [...] "swathes" [...] of Britain that are no-go areas for non-Muslims, Hopkins replied that she couldn't for [...] "legal reasons". When Neil pointed out there could be no legal problems with identifying an area she continued to refuse, saying only “I know those places exist".|$|E
