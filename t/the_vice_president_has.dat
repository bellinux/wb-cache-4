5000|$|Marine One is {{the call}} sign of any United States Marine Corps {{aircraft}} carrying the President of the United States. It usually denotes a helicopter operated by Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1 [...] "Nighthawks"), either the large Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King or the newer, smaller VH-60N [...] "White Hawk".

50|$|As President of the Senate, <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> {{two primary}} duties: {{to cast a}} vote {{in the event of a}} Senate {{deadlock}} and to preside over and certify the official vote count of the U.S. Electoral College. For example, in the first half of 2001, the Senators were divided 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats and Dick Cheney's tie-breaking vote gave the Republicans the Senate majority.|$|E

Unable to secure Sacasa’s resignation, Vargas took steps to ascend the Presidency by means which would secure recognition of the United States.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> {{was elected}} by an electoral college (closely modeled after the U.S. Electoral College) along with the President. If no {{candidate}} won {{a majority in the}} Electoral College, the Confederate Senate would elect <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> from <b>the</b> top two vote-getters. Candidates for <b>President</b> and <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> could not be citizens of the same state. Like <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> to be a natural-born citizen of the Confederacy or a natural-born citizen of the U.S. born prior to December 20, 1860, and a resident in the Confederacy for over 14 years.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>had</b> {{in recent}} administrations been {{considered}} a relatively low-level political functionary, whose activities were generally limited to the constitutional function of presiding over the Senate. Hobart, however, became a close adviser to McKinley and his Cabinet members, although he was not called upon to attend Cabinet meetings. Reporter Arthur Wallace Dunn wrote of Hobart in 1922, [...] "for {{the first time in}} my recollection, and the last for that matter, <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> was recognized as somebody, as a part of the Administration, and as a part of the body over which he presided".|$|R
50|$|The United States Constitution designates the Vice President of the United States {{to serve}} as {{president}} of the Senate and to cast the tie-breaking vote {{in the case of a}} deadlock. To carry out these duties, <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> long had an office in the Capitol Building, just outside the Senate chamber. Due to lack of space in the Capitol’s old Senate wing, early vice presidents often shared their room with the president. Following the 1850s extension of the building, the Senate formally set aside a room for the vice president’s exclusive use.|$|E
50|$|The Vice President {{may play}} a major role in foreign affairs. For instance, the Vice President {{generally}} sits on the Foreign Affairs Leading Group, a policy coordination body of the Communist Party. <b>The</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> also typically sits on the Central Coordination Group for Hong Kong and Macau Affairs. Therefore, while the Vice President may not actually have substantive powers as defined in the Constitution, the office nonetheless carries significance and prestige. The holders of the office have all been individuals with a degree of political clout.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between the executive and legislative branches are poorly defined. An example of the problems this causes is the near complete political paralysis that results when the president, who has neither the power to veto nor the ability to dissolve the legislature and call new elections, cannot negotiate with the legislature when his party is in the minority. The examination and control yuans are marginal branches; their leaders {{as well as the}} leaders of the executive and judicial yuans are appointed by the president and confirmed by the legislative yuan. The legislature is the only branch that chooses its own leadership. <b>The</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> practically no responsibilities.|$|E
50|$|The Constitution of the Dominican Republic {{has been}} amended many times, {{and in some}} {{instances}} the office of <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> been eliminated to later be recreated. In times when the office was eliminated, if the President was leaving the country, an acting President was designated, therefore creating the post of a second in command. For example the 30th President of the Dominican Republic, Carlos Felipe Morales, elected Ramón Cáceres to be his <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> from 1903 until 1905. Then from 1905-1911, <b>the</b> previous <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> Ramón Cáceres is elected as President and the office of <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> is eliminated during that time span.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{newspaper}} reports, <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>had</b> gotten severely inebriated, {{and when}} aides to the now-dead president came {{to fetch the}} new President {{they were unable to}} wake him for several minutes. When he was finally awake, the accounts read, [...] "he had puffy eyes and his hair was caked with mud from the street," [...] and that a barber and doctor were summoned to clean him up for the ten-o'clock ceremony, which most accounts agree went smoothly. However, there are other accounts, believed more reliable by some, which refute this claim.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> also <b>has</b> an oath of office, {{but it is}} not {{mandated}} by the Constitution and is prescribed by statute. Currently, <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> Presidential oath is the same as that for Members of Congress.|$|R
5000|$|The Man by Irving Wallace (1964): <b>The</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> {{died of a}} heart attack, and {{the office}} is vacant (the 25th Amendment had not yet been written). The President and the Speaker of the House both die {{as the result of the}} {{accidental}} collapse of a building, and the President pro tempore of the Senate, an African-American, becomes President. (In the conditions prevailing at the time of writing - with the right of African-Americans to civil equality still hotly disputed in the South - Wallace assumed that it was impossible for one of them to achieve the presidency by direct election, and that the only way it could happen would be by an unlikely accident).|$|E

50|$|Executive {{power is}} vested to the President; in {{practice}} however, the president delegates {{his power to}} a cabinet. The president, who is both {{the head of state}} and head of government, is directly elected to a single six-year term via first past the post. In case of death, resignation or incapacitation, the Vice President acts as the president until the expiration of the term. The Vice President is elected separately from the president, and may be of differing political parties. While <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> no constitutional powers aside from acting as president when the latter is unable to do so, the president may give the former a cabinet office. The cabinet is mostly composed of the heads of the executive departments, which provide services to the people, and other cabinet-level officials.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{section of}} 28N between Long Lake and North Creek is a scenic byway named the RooseveltMarcy Trail. This was the route {{traveled}} on September10, 1901 by Theodore Roosevelt, then <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> of <b>the</b> United States. <b>The</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>had</b> hiked to <b>the</b> summit of nearby Mount Marcy earlier, while there, learned that <b>President</b> William McKinley, <b>having</b> been shot four days earlier by anarchist Leon Czolgosz in Buffalo, was near death.

50|$|The Vice President of the United States is {{assigned}} the responsibility by the Constitution of {{presiding over the}} Senate and designated as its president. <b>The</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> the authority (ex officio, for {{he or she is}} not an elected member of the Senate) to cast a tie-breaking vote. Early Vice Presidents took an active role in regularly presiding over proceedings of the body, with the President pro tempore only being called on during the Vice President's absence. During the 20th century, the role of the vice president evolved into more of an executive branch position. Now, the vice president is usually seen {{as an integral part of}} a president's administration and presides over the Senate only on ceremonial occasions or when a tie-breaking vote may be needed.|$|E
5000|$|If no {{vice presidential}} {{candidate}} receives an Electoral College majority, then the Senate selects the vice president, {{in accordance with the}} United States Constitution. The Twelfth Amendment states that a [...] "majority of the whole number" [...] of Senators (currently 51 of 100) is necessary for election. Further, the language requiring an absolute majority of Senate votes precludes the sitting vice president from breaking any tie which might occur. The election of 1836 is the only election so far where the office of <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>has</b> been decided by the Senate. During the campaign, Martin Van Buren's running mate Richard Mentor Johnson was accused of having lived with a black woman. Virginia's 23 electors, who were pledged to Van Buren and Johnson, refused to vote for Johnson (but still voted for Van Buren). The election went to the Senate, where Johnson was elected 33-17.|$|E
5000|$|The Vice President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Phó Chủ tịch nước Cộng hòa xã hội chủ nghĩa Việt Nam), {{known as}} Deputy Chairman of the Council of State (...) from 1981 to 1992, {{is the vice}} head of state of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The Vice President is {{appointed}} {{on the recommendation of}} the President to the National Assembly. The president can also recommend the vice president's dismissal and resignation from office. Upon the President's recommendation, <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> to be approved by the National Assembly. The main duty of a Vice President is to help the President in discharging his duties - in certain cases, the Vice President can be empowered bythe president to replace him in the discharge of some of his duties. If the president can't discharge of his duties, the Vice President becomes acting president (Tôn Đức Thắng and Nguyễn Hữu Thọ were both acting presidents for a short period). In case of vacancy, the vice president will remain acting president until the National Assembly elects a new president.|$|E

Ibrahim Jalis, a popular columnist in Pakistan, reported that everyone was excited by the fact that <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>had</b> invited Bashir to come to America. Perhaps, he had made the above reported statement while shaking Bashir's hand, leading to the misunderstanding that he had been invited. His column was favorable to Johnson, and contained the quote, [...] "Don't conquer a country, don't conquer a government. If you wish to conquer, conquer the hearts of the people." ...|$|R
