5|$|Any {{counting}} formula involving vertices {{and faces}} that is valid for all planar graphs may be transformed by planar duality into an equivalent formula in which <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertices and faces have been swapped.

Another given by Harary involves the handshaking lemma, {{according to which}} {{the sum of the}} degrees of the vertices of any graph equals twice the number of edges. In its dual form, this lemma states that in a plane graph, the sum of the numbers of sides of the faces of the graph equals twice the number of edges.|$|E

5|$|From the {{descriptions}} of the rules above, two important properties of its dynamics may immediately be seen. First, in Rule 184, for any finite set of cells with periodic boundary conditions, the number of 1s {{and the number of}} 0s in a pattern remains invariant throughout the pattern's evolution. Rule 184 and its reflection are the only elementary cellular automata to have this property of number conservation. Similarly, if the density of 1s is well-defined for an infinite array of cells, it remains invariant as the automaton carries out its steps. And second, although Rule 184 is not symmetric under left-right reversal, it does have a different symmetry: reversing left and right {{and at the same time}} swapping <b>the</b> <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 0 and 1 symbols produces a cellular automaton with the same update rule.|$|E
