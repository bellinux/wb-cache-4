5|$|An X-ray of {{swallowed}} barium {{may be used}} {{to reveal}} {{the size and shape of}} <b>the</b> <b>esophagus,</b> and the presence of any masses. <b>The</b> <b>esophagus</b> may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into <b>the</b> <b>esophagus,</b> in a procedure called an endoscopy. If an endoscopy is used on the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through <b>the</b> <b>esophagus.</b> During an endoscopy, a biopsy may be taken.

5|$|Food is {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx and then into <b>the</b> <b>esophagus.</b> <b>The</b> <b>esophagus</b> is thus {{one of the first}} components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through <b>the</b> <b>esophagus,</b> it enters the stomach. When food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down <b>the</b> <b>esophagus.</b> These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also {{as a response to the}} sensation of food within <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.|$|E
50|$|While in Istanbul in 1936, Nissen excised an esophageal ulcer from a 28-year-old patient. The {{operation}} required Nissen {{to remove}} a portion of <b>the</b> lower <b>esophagus</b> and join <b>the</b> remaining <b>esophagus</b> to <b>the</b> stomach. In an effort to avoid the backflow of stomach contents into <b>the</b> patient's <b>esophagus,</b> Nissen wrapped (plicated) folds of the patient's upper stomach around <b>the</b> lower <b>esophagus.</b> Following <b>the</b> patient subsequently, Nissen noted that the patient's problems with heartburn improved after surgery.|$|R
50|$|Esophageal atresia is a {{congenital}} defect of the digestive {{system in which}} the continuity of the esophageal wall is interrupted. In most cases, <b>the</b> upper <b>esophagus</b> fails to connect with <b>the</b> lower <b>esophagus</b> and stomach.|$|R
30|$|We {{describe}} {{the identification of}} a fish bone in <b>the</b> cervical <b>esophagus</b> using point-of-care ultrasound.

5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve <b>the</b> <b>esophagus,</b> with blood supply varying along its course. The upper parts of <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> {{and the upper}} esophageal {{sphincter}} receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery, the parts of <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of <b>the</b> <b>esophagus.</b> The upper and middle parts of <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of}} the left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the celiac nodes.|$|E
5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down <b>the</b> <b>esophagus.</b> This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia {{refers to a}} failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of <b>the</b> <b>esophagus,</b> and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of <b>the</b> <b>esophagus,</b> such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> and interfere with peristalsis.|$|E
5|$|The muscular {{layer of}} <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> has {{two types of}} muscle. The upper third of <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> {{contains}} striated muscle, the lower third contains smooth muscle, and the middle third contains a mixture of both. Muscle is arranged in two layers: {{one in which the}} muscle fibers run longitudinal to <b>the</b> <b>esophagus,</b> and the other in which the fibers encircle <b>the</b> <b>esophagus.</b> These are separated by the myenteric plexus, a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of <b>the</b> <b>esophagus.</b> The outermost layer of <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in serosa. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Barrettâ€™s {{esophagus}} develops as {{a result}} of chronic injury of esophagus epithelium from gastroe-sophageal reflux disease.

5|$|The {{surrounded}} sac {{becomes the}} primitive gut.

5|$|A {{structure}} {{with the same}} name is often found in invertebrates, including molluscs and arthropods, connecting the oral cavity with the stomach. In terms of the digestive system of snails and slugs, the mouth opens into an esophagus, which connects to the stomach. Because of torsion, which is {{the rotation of the}} main body of the animal during larval development, <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> usually passes around the stomach, and opens into its back, furthest from the mouth. In species that have undergone de-torsion, however, <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> may open into the anterior of the stomach, which is the reverse of the usual gastropod arrangement. There is an extensive rostrum at the front of <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> in all carnivorous snails and slugs. In the freshwater snail species Tarebia granifera, the brood pouch is above <b>the</b> <b>esophagus.</b>|$|E
5|$|In most fish, <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> is {{extremely}} short, {{primarily due to}} the length of the pharynx (which is associated with the gills).

5|$|The cephalic {{molluscs}} {{have two}} pairs of main nerve cords organized around a number of paired ganglia, the visceral cords serving the internal organs and the pedal ones serving the foot. Most pairs of corresponding ganglia {{on both sides of}} the body are linked by commissures (relatively large bundles of nerves). The ganglia above the gut are the cerebral, the pleural, and the visceral, which are located above <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> (gullet). The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are below <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> and their commissure and connectives to the cerebral and pleural ganglia surround <b>the</b> <b>esophagus</b> in a circumesophageal nerve ring or nerve collar.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>esophagus</b> {{is one of}} {{the upper}} parts of the {{digestive}} system. There are taste buds on its upper part.

25|$|Achalasia {{is a major}} {{exception}} to usual pattern of dysphagia in that swallowing of fluid tends to cause more difficulty than swallowing solids.

5|$|In {{its early}} stages, esophageal cancer {{may not have}} any {{symptoms}} at all. When severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of <b>the</b> <b>esophagus,</b> making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any metastases {{in different parts of}} the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of <b>the</b> <b>esophagus.</b> Inserting a stent into <b>the</b> <b>esophagus,</b> or inserting a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. , the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment.|$|E
