He {{claimed that the}} story worked [...] "either way" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "awesome", mainly because of the hallucinations. Fowler stated that he had his [...] "mind blown" [...] and that {{the best part of the}} episode was [...] "when the show, for a little while, actually made me think that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> Gabriel's Dr. Wild story". Claiming that he was [...] "hooked" [...] to the show, Folwer concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "9 out of 10" [...] classifying it as [...] "amazing". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club enjoyed the episode. In his [...] "A-" [...] review, he noted that the episode [...] "doesn't show any signs of imminent immolation". He thought that the morale of the episode was [...] "wanting something to be real doesn't make it easier to pretend, and the harder Michael has to work to keep this up, the better the odds that he’s going to lose his grip". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix [...] "loved" [...] the episode. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic gave the episode a [...] "5 out of 5" [...] as a perfect score and thought that the entry [...] "really used Awake concept to its advantage".|$|E
2500|$|In a 1985 interview, {{when asked}} what caused his change of opinion, Hynek responded, [...] "Two things, really. One was the {{completely}} negative and unyielding attitude of the Air Force. They wouldn't give UFOs the chance of existing, {{even if they were}} flying {{up and down the street}} in broad daylight. Everything had to have an explanation. I began to resent that, even though I basically felt the same way, because I still thought they weren't going about it in the right way. You can't assume that everything is black no matter what. Secondly, the caliber of the witnesses began to trouble me. Quite a few instances were reported by military pilots, for example, and I knew them to be fairly well-trained, so this is when I first began to think that, well, maybe <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> all this." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{threat of}} a RICO {{indictment}} unnerved many at Drexel. [...] A RICO indictment would have required the firm {{to put up a}} performance bond of as much as $1 billion in lieu of having its assets frozen. [...] This provision was put in the law because organized crime had a habit of absconding with the funds of indicted companies, and the writers of RICO wanted to make sure <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> seize or forfeit {{in the event of a}} guilty verdict. [...] Unfortunately, most of Drexel's capital was borrowed money, as is common with most Wall Street firms (in Drexel's case, 96 percent—by far the most of any firm). [...] This debt would have to take second place to this performance bond. [...] Additionally, if the bond ever had to be paid, Drexel's stockholders would have been all but wiped out. [...] Due to this, banks will not extend credit to a firm under a RICO indictment.|$|E

2500|$|Callery did {{not begin}} {{composing}} the series' main theme until after reading two or three scripts, and {{did not see the}} opening graphics until after the second episode, at which point he had [...] "a framework for a theme that [...] hoped would work". At this time, Callery said he started [...] "fooling around" [...] with ideas for the theme, and eventually settled on one that he felt had a [...] "sneaky and fun" [...] quality, adding, Jessica Jones [...] "has dry humor, a real edge to her. But <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> this character that had a little whisker of playfulness in there, like a cat or something." [...] After creating the theme, Callery expanded it, adding a [...] "fun" [...] rhythmic quality, and eventually fully orchestrating it to include a piano, which he played himself, as well as instruments such as the acoustic bass, and additional sound design. Regarding the electric guitar's entrance, Callery pointed out that it got [...] "bigger there because as I looked at the graphics, the lights got a little more strobe-y. So that's when I decided the electric guitar might be a kind of neat add there so that the whole piece will arc a little more." ...|$|E

60|$|The Turk was bustled off, {{a little}} unwillingly. Peter watched {{them with a}} smile. It was many months since he had felt so keen an {{interest}} in life.
