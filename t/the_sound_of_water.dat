25|$|Shortly after 9 A.M., {{with the}} {{submersible}} {{about to be}} lifted {{out of the water}} with a towline back onto the ship, a water alarm sounded in the aft sphere, a self-contained part of the submersible containing machinery and oil storage. The towline had apparently fouled on the aft sphere hatch and wrenched it open. With <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> entering the aft compartment, Pisces III became inverted and began to sink back to the seabed. The aft sphere was now fully flooded. The additional weight of water now added over a tonne of extra weight to the submersible.|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} Radical Dreamers {{was written by}} {{composer}} Yasunori Mitsuda, who scored Chrono Trigger and later Chrono Cross. The soundtrack includes several ambient pieces, including <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> running in a fountain and wind accompanied by strings. Players can listen to the game's songs by accessing a hidden menu in the [...] "Gil: Caught Between Love and Adventure" [...] scenario. Several themes and musical patterns were later adapted for Chrono Cross on the suggestion of director Masato Kato; many appear unchanged except for new instrumentation.|$|E
500|$|Radical Dreamers was a 1996 text-based Visual Novel set as a gaiden, or side story, to Chrono Trigger. [...] It was {{released}} to complement its predecessor's plot, and later served as inspiration for Chrono Cross. The music of Radical Dreamers {{was written by}} Yasunori Mitsuda. The soundtrack includes several ambient pieces, including <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> running in a fountain and wind accompanied by strings. Players can listen to the game's 15 songs by accessing a hidden menu {{in one of the}} game's scenarios. The soundtrack has never been released as a separate album.|$|E
60|$|As {{every one}} else echoed the sentiment, Angus, nothing loath, began to {{discourse}} sweet sounds, which, to say truth, were indeed very sweet, and mingled not inharmoniously with <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> which gurgled gently underneath.|$|R

60|$|Rollo listened, and he {{immediately}} perceived {{that it was}} <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and he jumped and capered with delight, at thinking how fine a sight it must be.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lean on me," [...] {{said the}} other; [...] "let us {{get into the}} shelter of yon thicket, that will conceal us from the view; I hear <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> which will refresh you." ...|$|E
60|$|Between us and {{the mouth}} of the gulley rose, or rather sank, a sheer precipice that was {{apparently}} three or four hundred feet in depth, and at its foot we could hear <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then {{they led}} him to the hall, where Eric clothed himself and rested, and he sent back the thrall Jon to Coldback, bidding him tell Saevuna, Eric's mother, that he was safe. But he was {{somewhat}} weak all that day, and <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> roared in his ears.|$|R

60|$|Then {{suddenly}} his ears were opened, {{and he heard}} <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> running <b>water.</b>|$|R
60|$|Drip! drip! drip! It {{was like}} <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{dripping}} from a leak in a roof. It was directly under me, and, quick as thought, I knew {{the sound was}} made by my own dripping blood.|$|E
60|$|The man gilded away, {{his master}} {{following}} close behind. From somewhere further inside the flat, <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> running into a bath was heard. The door was closed, again there was silence. The fox terrier, {{after a few}} moments' scratching at the door, resumed his place upon the rug and curled himself up to renewed slumber.|$|E
60|$|The {{four sides}} of the stockade had been manned by that time. Lingard, {{ascending}} the banquette, looked out and saw the lagoon shrouded in white, without {{as much as a}} shadow on it, and so still that not even <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> lapping the shore reached his ears. He found himself in profound accord with this blind and soundless peace.|$|E

60|$|The guns {{began to}} speak again among the hills that we dived into; the air grew chillier as we climbed; forest and wet rocks closed round us in the mist, to <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> {{trickling}} alongside; there was a tang of wet fern, cut pine, and the first breath of autumn when the road entered a tunnel and a new world--Alsace.|$|R
50|$|Tinker Creek, {{originally}} called Tinkle Creek, {{was named}} for <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> running <b>water,</b> according to local history.|$|R
6000|$|... "Extraordinary {{occupation}} I am giving {{myself up}} to," [...] he murmured. And {{it occurred to}} him that this was about the only sound he could listen to innocently, and for his own pleasure, as it were. Yes, <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> the voice of the wind--completely foreign to human passions. All the other sounds of this earth brought contamination to the solitude of a soul.|$|E
60|$|Elsie {{laughed and}} rose; {{she was already}} dressed. Mr Ravenshaw had on the {{previous}} night ordered both his daughters to lie down in their clothes, as no one could tell {{what might happen to}} the house at any moment. The flood had not yet begun to abate; Elsie could tell that, as she sat arranging her hair, from <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> gurgling through the lower rooms.|$|E
60|$|He {{started down}} the rocks. More rocks rose up ahead and he climbed them. Suddenly he stopped, listening. Far off, he could hear a sound, <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Was he {{approaching}} a pool of some kind? He went on again, trying to locate the sound. He scrambled down rocks and up rocks, and all around him there was silence, except for the splashing of distant water. Maybe a waterfall, water in motion. A stream. If he found the stream he might find the natives.|$|E

6000|$|First {{he seemed}} to see, and then not to see. Then he saw clearly little edges of foam {{pursuing}} each other, and a wide waste <b>of</b> weltering <b>waters</b> below him. Far away was a pilot boat with a big sail bearing dim black letters, and a little pinkish-yellow light, and it was rolling and pitching, rolling and pitching in a gale, while he could feel no wind at, all. Soon <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> was loud and near. He was dropping, dropping--into the sea! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{two young}} people were far too glad to hear of any {{prospect}} of release, to think much of the dangers or discomforts of the mode. Walter danced for joy {{up and down the}} room like a young colt, as he thought of being in a few hours more in the free open air, with <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> rippling below, and the shade of trees above him. Mabel threw herself on her knees before her rude crucifix, partly in thankfulness, partly in dread of the passage that was to come first.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, now I {{understand}}," [...] she said, [...] "now I {{know why}} we are lonely, {{and how we can}} lose our loneliness. Now I know what it is that stirs us in the beauty of the sky, in <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and in the scent of flowers. It is Love who speaks in everything, though till we hear his voice we understand nothing. But when we hear, then the riddle is answered and the gates of our heart are opened, and, Allan, we see the way that wends through death to heaven, and is lost in the glory of which our love is but a shadow.|$|E
60|$|Instantly {{my words}} were caught {{up by the}} sentries and passed from post to post till the city rang with them. They were cried in every street and canal, they echoed from the roofs of houses, and among the summits of a hundred temples. The city awoke with a murmur, from the lake came <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> beaten by ten {{thousand}} oars, as though myriads of wild-fowl had sprung suddenly from their reedy beds. Here, there, and everywhere torches flashed out like falling stars, wild notes were blown on horns and shells, and above all arose the booming of the snakeskin drum which the priests upon the teocalli beat furiously.|$|E

6000|$|The [...] "lonely road" [...] {{referred}} to in these Lines, was, in all likelihood, the path from Town-end towards the Swan Inn past the Hollins, Grasmere. A [...] "mighty unison of streams" [...] may be heard there any autumn evening after a stormy day, and especially after long continued rain, <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> from Easdale, from Greenhead Ghyll, and the slopes of Silver How, blending {{with that of the}} Rothay in the valley below.

60|$|So Sir Launcelot rode as best {{he might}} through the {{darkness}} of the forest, and he rode all night, and shortly after the dawning of the day he heard <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> rushing <b>water.</b>|$|R
60|$|Appleby {{did as he}} was bidden, {{and stood}} staring forward in the bows when the sail came down. The boat lay {{plunging}} on the heave that was streaked with flecks of froth, and there was a long trail of sliding haze not far away from them. From out of it came <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> parting under iron bows. Then two tall spars that swung a little rose out of the vapor, and next moment a blur of shadowy hull grew into visibility. It lengthened rapidly, a smear of smoke streamed across the sea, but there was no blink of light beneath it, and with the froth piled up at her bows the vessel came down upon them, portentous in her blackness and silence.|$|E
6000|$|Presently {{they heard}} <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> It filled them with mitigated joy and excitement, on the simple {{principle}} that {{anything in the}} shape of variety was better than nothing. A clap of thunder would have raised in their depressed bosoms a gleam of hope. A flash of lightning would have been a positive blessing. Mr Sudberry at once suggested that it must be a stream, and that they could follow its course--wade down its bed, if necessary--till they should arrive at [...] "something!" [...] Foolish man! he had been long enough in the Highlands by that time to have known that to walk down the bed of a mountain-burn was about as possible as to walk down the shaft of a coal-mine. They came to the edge of its banks, however, and, looking over, tried to pierce its gloom. There was a pale gleam of white foam--a rumbling, rustling sound beneath, and a sensation of moisture in the atmosphere.|$|E
60|$|At first, when {{he opened}} his eyes, he fancied, from <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in his ears, that it must have come on to rain very heavily, but, being {{regardless}} of rain, he tried to fall asleep again. Then he felt as if there must be a leak in his berth somewhere, he was so wet; but, being sleepy, he shut his eyes, and tried to shut his senses against moisture. Not succeeding, he resolved to turn on his other side, but experienced a strange resistance to that effort. Waxing testy, he wrenched himself round, and in so doing kicked out somewhat impatiently. This, of course, woke him up to the real state of the case. It also awoke Slagg, who received the kick on his shins. He, delivering a cry of pain straight into Sam Shipton's ear, caused that youth to fling out his fist, which fell on Stumps's nose, and thus in rapid succession were the sleepers roused effectually to a full sense of their condition.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> raindrops hitting <b>water</b> {{is caused}} by bubbles of air {{oscillating}} underwater.|$|R
60|$|He ceased, and {{his voice}} died away in the echoes of the great place. Once again there was silence, broken only by <b>the</b> seething <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> and <b>the</b> indefinable murmur of an unseen throng beneath.|$|R
60|$|These matters settled, the new aristocrat could yawn {{and stretch}} like any aristocrat {{under the old}} dispensation, and then as <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> running <b>water</b> from <b>the</b> {{bathroom}} ceased, stick his toes out of bed.|$|R
