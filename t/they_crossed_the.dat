5|$|ARVN Brigadier General Vu Van Giai gave Anderson a Ranger {{platoon of}} about 20 men and three M-48 tanks {{that they used}} to set up a forward {{operating}} base along Highway QL-9 within observation range of the strategic Cam Lo Bridge. But Giai thought that the mission was insane and refused {{to take responsibility for the}} mission once <b>they</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Song Meiu Giang. Anderson, who spoke Vietnamese, obtained additional intelligence from the headquarters of the 1st Armor Brigade near Dong Ha.|$|E
5|$|Acqua & Sapone rider Dario Andriotto set {{the early}} time to beat. After a while, Yuriy Krivtsov bested his time. Several {{different}} riders in succession then posted successively (but, {{in the first}} few cases, marginally) better times than the best time that had come before them. Alessandro Bertolini, David Millar, Marco Pinotti, Giovanni Visconti, Bradley Wiggins, and Stefano Garzelli were all briefly the stage leader after <b>they</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> finish line. Bertolini in particular was stage leader for about three minutes, as Millar started just behind him and barely beat his time.|$|E
5|$|After {{this the}} brigade {{continued}} to advance, moving through Ruddenburg and Greven before carrying out {{an attack on}} Osnabruck on 4 April 1945. On the night of 7/8 April <b>they</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Weser River in assault boats and {{under the cover of}} darkness carried out a flanking manoeuvre on the Germans occupying the town of Leese, catching them by surprise.|$|E

5|$|Lladron Maelrhys are {{two large}} stones {{on the border}} between Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw. It is claimed that, years ago, thieves broke into St Maelrhys Church, intent on {{stealing}} money. Caught in the act, they fled for their lives but were caught as they approached Y Rhiw, and killed on the spot; the stones mark their burial place. Another version claims that as <b>they</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> parish boundary they were turned to stone for their sacrilege.|$|E
5|$|McCormick {{increasingly}} {{resented the}} favours FitzRoy gave to assist Darwin with collecting. On 16 February, FitzRoy landed a small party including himself and Darwin on St. Paul's rocks, finding the seabirds so tame {{that they could}} be killed easily, while an exasperated McCormick was left circling the islets in a second small boat. That evening novices were greeted by a pseudo-Neptune, and in the morning <b>they</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> equator with the traditional line-crossing ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The Magyars, {{settled in}} the Pontic-Caspian steppe by the 830s, began a westward {{migration}} after their defeat {{by a coalition of}} Pechenegs and Bulgarians in about 895. <b>They</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Carpathian Mountains, invading the surrounding area. Gelou is a local ruler described in the Gesta Hungarorum as an opponent of the invading Magyars. Anonymus did not write about Simeon I of Bulgaria, Svatopluk I of Moravia or other opponents known from contemporary sources, instead chronicling Magyar battles with local rulers (including Gelou, Menumorut and Salan) not mentioned in other primary sources.|$|E

5|$|The group, now {{numbering}} approximately twenty people, left Constantinople {{in early}} May 1915. <b>They</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Bosphorus {{to take the}} unfinished Baghdad Railway to Baghdad. The Taurus Mountains were crossed on horseback, using—as von Hentig reflected—the same route taken by Alexander the Great, Paul the Apostle, and Frederick I. The group crossed the Euphrates at high flood, finally reaching Baghdad {{towards the end of}} May.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of the SDS/SUK and Mihailović's Chetniks remained under the overall command of Damjanovič {{as part of the}} Chetnik Šumadija Division. These Chetniks had been under the command of the SS since 12 December 1944. <b>They</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> river Soča and surrendered to the British Army near the Italian-Yugoslav border on 5 May 1945. Fortunately for them, they were interned as prisoners of war and other than a few senior officers, were not repatriated to Yugoslavia to face trial.|$|E
5|$|At 07:00 on {{the morning}} of 25 November, the Portuguese {{garrison}} at Ngomano received word from a British intelligence officer that an attack was about to commence. Nevertheless, when the attack came they were unprepared. In order to distract Pinto and his men, the Germans shelled the camp from across the river with high explosive rounds. While the artillery attacked the camp, the Germans moved their forces upstream and crossed the Rovuma safely out sight of Pinto and his men. The Portuguese did not resist von Lettow-Vorbeck's forces when <b>they</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> river and remained encamped at Ngomano. The Germans were easily able to flank the Portuguese positions and completely envelop them with six companies of German infantry attacking the camp from the south, south-east and west.|$|E

5|$|Attached to the No.1 Column {{commanded}} by Colonel Charles Pearson, <b>they</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Tugela River from Natal into Zululand on 12 January 1879. On 22 January they saw {{action in the}} Battle of Inyezane, driving off an attacking force of Zulus with rockets, Martini-Henry rifles and the Gatling gun. The same day the British main force was defeated at the Battle of Isandlwana, and so Pearson's column advanced to Eshowe, where it was besieged for two months, until relieved on 3 April. During the campaign, Actives crew suffered only one man killed, and nine wounded in action against the enemy, while nine died of disease during the siege, and one man drowned while crossing the Tugela. In 1881 the South Africa Medal was awarded to those members of Actives crew that had served there.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the {{regiment}} undertook basic training including weapons handling, ceremonial drill, mounted and dismounted tactics and regimental manoeuvres. In late April, they marched through {{the centre of}} Sydney {{as part of a}} farewell before deploying overseas. On 11 June, after the brigade had concentrated, {{the regiment}} embarked upon the troopship SS Suevic. After four days steaming, the ship put into Adelaide, South Australia, where the regiment disembarked their horses due to concerns about death rates among horses travelling at that time of year. The men continued on their journey three days later, undertaking rifle and signals training on deck during the day. <b>They</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> equator in the early afternoon on 5 July; a short time later an epidemic of measles broke out.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the confusion and loss of leadership aboard the American vessel, the British boarding party was being effectively organised. A number of small-arms men rushed aboard Chesapeake, led by Broke, including the purser, Mr G. Aldham, and the clerk, Mr John Dunn. Aldham and Dunn were killed as <b>they</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> gangway, {{but the rest of}} the party made it onto Chesapeake. Captain Broke, at the head of not more than twenty men, stepped from the rail of the waist-hammock netting onto the muzzle of the after-carronade of Chesapeake, and from there he jumped down to her quarterdeck. As the British boarded there were no American officers left on the quarterdeck to organise resistance.|$|E

5|$|In {{the city}} of Corning, NY44, and later NY414, {{originally}} entered from the north on Baker Street and met NY17 at Pulteney Street. The two routes then overlapped along Pulteney Street to Centerway, where <b>they</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Chemung River via Centerway and Pine Street. At Market Street, NY17 and NY44 turned east and remained concurrent to Conhocton Street, where NY44 headed south to Caton while NY17 continued east on Market to the hamlet of Gibson. When the overlap through Corning was eliminated in 1949, NY414 was truncated to {{the western end of}} the overlap at the intersection of Baker and Pulteney Streets.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, {{striking}} workers in Chicago met near the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company plant. Union molders {{at the plant}} had been locked out since early February and the predominantly Irish-American workers at McCormick had come under attack from Pinkerton guards during an earlier strike action in 1885. This event, along with the eight-hour militancy of McCormick workers, had gained the strikers some respect and notoriety around the city. By {{the time of the}} 1886 general strike, strikebreakers entering the McCormick plant were under protection from a garrison of 400 police officers. Although half of the replacement workers defected to the general strike on May 1, McCormick workers continued to harass strikebreakers as <b>they</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> picket lines.|$|E
5|$|SG 4′s {{mission was}} also a disaster. During the {{assembly}} phase, they flew across JG 11′s flight path, and the formation was broken up. Some of the pilots joined JG 11 in the confusion. Unable to recover the formation, I and II./SG 4 then decided to head home. The Kommodore, Druschel, had continued with five other pilots from III./SG 4 who had lost contact with their Gruppe. <b>They</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> front near Hürtgenwald around 09:10. As they did so, American anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, claiming seven aircraft in the next 30 minutes. Only six of the 50 Fw 190s of SG 4 carried out an attack, against airfields near Aachen and the Asch aerodrome. Of these six, four did not return. Druschel himself was reported missing.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the British force caught Tirpitz by surprise. While the {{aircraft}} had first been {{picked up by a}} German radar station shortly after <b>they</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian coastline, the battleship was not immediately warned. At the time of the attack Tirpitz was preparing to sail for her high-speed trials, and her crew were busy unmooring the vessel. Her five protective destroyers had already departed for the trials area in Stjern Sound. The warning from the radar station arrived shortly before the British aircraft appeared over Kaafjord, and the battleship's crew were {{still in the process of}} moving to their battle stations when the attack commenced; at this time not all of the watertight doors were closed and some damage-control stations were not fully manned.|$|E
5|$|A {{few hours}} {{prior to its}} development, outer rainbands from the {{depression}} began moving over portions of the Texas coast. Heavy rainfall from intense thunderstorms caused minor flooding as <b>they</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> coastline during the subsequent days; precipitation in the state peaked at 14.13inches (358.9mm) at East Bay Bayou, the highest recorded rainfall total {{in association with the}} hurricane. Sustained winds peaked at 69mph (112km/h) with gusts to 85mph (137km/h) at Sea Rim State Park; the National Weather Service estimates gusts exceeded 90mph (145km/h) in southwestern Jefferson County and extreme southeastern Chambers County. In the Golden Pass Ship Channel, an unofficial report of a 115mph (185km/h) wind gust was relayed to the National Hurricane Center. Upon moving ashore, Humberto produced a minor storm surge in the state, peaking at 2.86feet (0.87m) at Rollover Pass; the combination of surge and waves resulted in light beach erosion.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to London in early 1937, {{recognising}} {{that she was not}} going to be a success on the stage David abandoned thoughts of a theatrical career. Later in the year she took a post as a junior assistant at the fashion house of Worth, where smart young women from upper class backgrounds were sought after as recruits. She found the subservience of retail work irksome, and resigned in early 1938. Over the next few months she spent time holidaying in the south of France and on Corsica, where she was greatly taken with the outgoing nature of the people she stayed with and the simple excellence of their food. After returning to London, and disenchanted with life there, she joined Cowan in buying a boat, just big enough to suffice, with the intention of sailing it to Greece. <b>They</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Channel in July 1939 and navigated the boat through the canal system of France to the Mediterranean coast.|$|E
