5|$|Heading {{into the}} eighth and final game, each team had three wins and three losses and one tie, but the Soviets were ahead in goal {{differential}} by two goals. In Canada, {{much of the}} country enjoyed an unofficial 'half a day' holiday, with many students in Toronto being sent home the afternoon of the game (which began at 1pm Eastern Time), while many others watched the game at work or school. In Montreal's Central Station, 5,000 fans gathered around ten <b>TV</b> <b>sets</b> to watch the game, which was simulcast in English on CBC Television and CTV, and in French by Radio-Canada. Until the men's hockey gold-medal game of the 2010 Winter Olympics, it was the most-watched sporting event in the history of Canadian television.|$|E

Unexplained murders have taken place in the small town, where bodies are found dangling from television antennas and their cause of death being unknown. At the same time, rumor has begun to spread that watching a switched-off television set on rainy midnights will reveal a person's soulmate. The game also follows the main characters into the TV World, a fog-shrouded realm filled with monsters called Shadows, which can only be accessed through <b>TV</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|E

25|$|For older televisions, a {{set-top box}} or other decoder is usually required.

25|$|Mode 7 was a Teletext mode, {{extremely}} economical {{on memory}} and an original requirement {{due to the}} BBC's own use of broadcast teletext (Ceefax). It also made the computer useful as a Prestel terminal. The teletext characters were generated on board, for use with monitors and <b>TV</b> <b>sets</b> without a Teletext receiver. Train time displays at UK stations were driven by BBC Master computers in this mode until around the late 1990s. Mode 7 used only 1 KB for video RAM by storing each character as its ASCII code, rather than its bitmap image as was needed for the other modes.|$|E
25|$|Following test {{transmissions}} in 1973–74, {{towards the}} end of 1974 the BBC news department put together an editorial team of nine, including and led by Editor Colin McIntyre, to develop a news and information service. Initially limited to 30 pages, the Ceefax service was later expanded to 100 pages and was launched formally in 1976. It was followed quickly by ORACLE and Prestel. Wireless World magazine ran a series of articles between November 1975 and June 1976 describing the design and construction of a teletext decoder using mainly TTL devices; however, development was limited until the first <b>TV</b> <b>sets</b> with built-in decoders started appearing in 1977.|$|E
