5|$|The Heck {{brothers}} bred together several European small {{horse and}} pony breeds hypothesized to be {{descended from the}} tarpan. They eventually integrated mares of the Konik, Icelandic horse, and Gotland breeds. These mares were bred to stallions of a wild horse type known as Przewalski's horse. The Hecks believed the wild Przewalski blood would help to draw out the wild characteristics they felt lay dormant in the domesticated pony breed mares. The initial crosses were made between Gotland and Icelandic mares (who visually closely resembled the tarpan, especially {{in the shape of}} the head) and Przewalski's horse stallions (who provided <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> dun coloration and upright mane), and the offspring were then bred to each other. The first foal born from the program who had <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> coloration was a colt born on May 22, 1933 at the Tierpark Hellabrunn. The breeding program continued, using only those horses who showed <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> skull shape, bone structure and coloration. Relatively quickly, the breed's conformation and coloration became set, with parents reliably passing their characteristics onto their offspring.|$|E
5|$|The {{array of}} a {{photovoltaic}} power system, or PV system, produces direct current (DC) power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. For practical use this usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current (AC), {{through the use}} of inverters. Multiple solar cells are connected inside modules. Modules are wired together to form arrays, then tied to an inverter, which produces power at <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> voltage, and for AC, <b>the</b> <b>desired</b> frequency/phase.|$|E

5000|$|Autonomy and {{connectedness}} {{refers to}} <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to have ties and connections with others versus {{the need to}} separate oneself as a unique individual. An example of autonomy and connectedness would be an athlete, who wants to feel like {{they are part of}} a team but also wanting to highlight their individual talents. Favoritism and impartiality refers to <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to be treated fairly and impartially versus <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to be seen and known as [...] "special". For instance, a professor may want to be impartial by creating an attendance policy but makes exceptions for students who participate in class and have good grades, demonstrating favoritism. Openness and closedness refers to <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to be open and divulge information versus <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to be exclusive and private. When chatting with a boss about one's weekend, there is <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to be open, however, closedness is also at play, as certain details are often left out, because of the context. Novelty and predictability suggest that there is a <b>desire</b> for <b>the</b> relationship to be predictable versus <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> for it to be original and new. When creating scheduled meetings for board members, the predictability may lie in a fixed schedule, however the novelty may be in scheduling a varying number of locations to peak interests as well as inspiration. Instrumentality and affection, is <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> for affection to be genuine versus <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> for affection to be motivated by benefits and perceived advantages of the relationship. An example of this would be being in a romantic relationship based on love and affection, but maintaining it for benefits such as financial security. Finally, equality and inequality refers to <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to be considered as equals versus <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to develop levels of superiority. A female in the military may seek treatment equivalent to that received by her male colleagues, but requires special barracks and adjusted assignments.|$|R
