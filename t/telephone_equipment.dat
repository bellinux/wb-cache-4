5|$|During 1997, {{there were}} five {{incidents}} where NSB's Nordic Mobile <b>Telephone</b> <b>equipment</b> interfered with the locomotive's electronics, causing the emergency brakes to activate. This caused a temporary halt until the motorman had unlocked the brakes. The problem was fixed by moving NSB's mobile senders. The units were taken into use on the Bergen Line from 5 January 1997. Later they entered into use on the Dovre and SÃ¸rland Lines, and then on regional trains around Oslo, such as the Vestfold Line. In August 1998, NSB stated that El 18 used more power {{than some of the}} substation transformers along the line could handle, particularly along the Vestfold Line. Part of the problem was caused by a mechanism in the locomotives whereby the motor was turned off if the wheels spin. The result was that the full power output of the El 18 along parts of the railway network could not be utilized.|$|E

25|$|After Cowherd's {{death in}} 1881 which {{resulted}} in the closure of his Brantford factory, a mechanical production department was created within the Bell Telephone Company of Canada and production of Canadian telephones and <b>telephone</b> <b>equipment</b> was transferred to Montreal in 1882, due to restrictions on importing <b>telephone</b> <b>equipment</b> from the United States. In addition to phones, four years later, the department started manufacturing its first switchboard, a 50 line Standard Magneto Switchboard. The small manufacturing department expanded yearly with the growth and popularity of the telephone to 50 employees in 1888. By 1890 it had been transformed into its own branch of operations with 200 employees, and a new factory was under construction.|$|E

25|$|In {{the absence}} of inland radar coverage, 1st AA Division's Chief Signals Officer, Lt-Col G.C.

These were linked by automatic <b>telephone</b> <b>equipment</b> to the Brompton operations room, where the angular plots were resolved to indicate grid squares where the HAA guns in range could fire an unseen barrage. This 'Fixed Azimuth' system came into action in June 1940, {{in time for the}} opening of the night Blitz on London. It was later replaced as searchlight control (SLC) and gunlaying (GL) radar systems were introduced.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1956 break-up, the Bell System {{included}} the companies listed below, plus those {{listed in the}} pre-1984 section. Northern Electric, and the Caribbean regional operating companies were {{considered part of the}} Bell System proper before the 1956 break-up. Nippon Electric was considered a more distant affiliate of Western Electric than Northern Electric, where Nippon Electric via its own research and development adapted the designs of Western Electric's North American telecommunications equipment for use in Japan, which to this day gives much of Japan's <b>telephone</b> <b>equipment</b> and network a closer resemblance to North American ANSI and Telcordia standards than to European-originated ITU-T standards. Before the 1956 break-up, Northern Electric was predominantly focused only on manufacturing, without any significant amount of telecommunication-equipment research & development of its own. The post-World War II-occupation operation of Japan's NTT was considered an administrative adjunct to the North American Bell System.|$|E

25|$|The Medical Treatment and Care Building {{included}} a basement level that was exposed (above grade) {{on the east}} and south sides, mixed (above and below grade) on the west side, and below grade {{on the north side}} of the building, due to the shallow slope at the site. The complete structure, including the four external stairways, could be considered five separate buildings, since the stair towers were detached from the main building by about four inches. Earthquake bracing used in the building's second through fifth floors consisted of shear walls, but a rarely used slip joint technique used with the concrete walls at the first floor level excluded them from being used with that system. Damage to the building (including ceiling tiles, <b>telephone</b> <b>equipment,</b> and elevator doors) was described as excessive at the basement and first floor levels, with little damage further up. The difference in rigidity at the second floor was proposed as a cause of the considerable damage to the lower levels. As a result of the first floor nearly collapsing, the building was leaning to the north by nearly two feet, and three of the four concrete stair towers fell away from the main building.|$|E
500|$|This {{information}} was simultaneously {{sent to the}} headquarters of each Group where it was cross-checked through a filter room before being sent through to another operations room, housed in an underground bunker.

500|$|Her {{cargo of}} 88 lorries, {{anti-aircraft}} guns, spare parts for aircraft, ammunition, communications equipment, coke and 400500 tons of hay, was unloaded in TromsÃ¸ on 27 April, {{as part of}} the Allied support of the Norwegian forces fighting the German invasion of their country. The cargo was put to use in the supply and defence of the TromsÃ¸ area, except for the hay, which was quarantined by the Norwegian authorities at RingvassÃ¸y for fear of foot-and-mouth disease. The coke on board Alster had been placed by the Germans in a [...] layer covering the deck. The supplies on Alster were transferred to the Norwegians by the Allied naval commander Lord Cork after the Norwegian authorities had made repeated request for weapons and other war matÃ©riel, and was intended to be a first effort before the arrival of larger quantities of arms and ammunition promised to the Norwegians. The lorries and weapons from Alster were received, assessed and distributed by Norwegian military personnel under the command of Major Karl Arnulf, who had arrived in TromsÃ¸ on 7 May 1940, having made his way from German-occupied South Norway. The communications equipment included both a mobile radio transmitter, which was used as a spare for TromsÃ¸ radio broadcasting station, as well as large quantities of field <b>telephone</b> <b>equipment</b> which was sent to the units of the Norwegian 6th Division on the Narvik front. The field equipment from Alster replaced the old and worn field telephone systems in use up to that point. Training on the German equipment was provided by Swedish volunteers. In order to satisfy British naval regulations with regards to prize cargoes, the British consul in TromsÃ¸ observed the unloading of Alster, and wrote an affidavit listing what had been given to the Norwegians, which was sent to the Admiralty. While docked in TromsÃ¸ in May 1940, Alster had 70 captive Germans on board. At TromsÃ¸, Alster was manned by Norwegian sailors, replacing the British prize crew.|$|E
