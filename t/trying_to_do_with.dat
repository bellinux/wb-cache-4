500|$|Yorke {{said that}} the {{starting}} point for the record was the [...] "incredibly dense and terrifying sound" [...] of Bitches Brew, the 1970 avant-garde jazz fusion album by Miles Davis. He described the sound of Bitches Brew to Q: [...] "It was building something up and watching it fall apart, that's the beauty of it. It was at the core of what we were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> OK Computer." [...] Yorke identified [...] "I'll Wear It Proudly" [...] by Elvis Costello, [...] "Fall on Me" [...] by R.E.M., [...] "Dress" [...] by PJ Harvey and [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] by the Beatles as particularly influential on the album's songwriting. Radiohead drew further inspiration from the recording style of film soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone and the krautrock band Can, musicians Yorke described as [...] "abusing the recording process".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz, and marked his directorial debut. Because of his position as both the writer of the episode and the director, Spotnitz later noted {{that it was hard}} to achieve perfection when filming the episode. However, he did note that, as both the writer and director, he had more creative control than usual. Originally Spotnitz did not have plans to direct the episode but was encouraged to do so by David Duchovny; Duchovny reminded Spotnitz that it would be the last Monster-of-the-Week (stand alone) episode to feature his character, Fox Mulder. After production and shooting was finalized, the rough cut of [...] "Alone" [...] was nine minutes over time and in order to compensate for the time, various sections were cut during final editing. Robert Patrick was very pleased with Spotnitz's work, stating, [...] "You're talking about some incredibly intelligent individuals, and they were very willing to let you, as an artist, discover what they were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the role. That's a wonderful environment to work in." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{several days}} in December 1986, U2 {{travelled}} with Corbijn and Averill on a bus around the Mojave Desert for a photo shoot. The group stayed in small hotels and shot in the desert landscape, beginning at Reno, Nevada, before moving to locations in California such as the ghost town of Bodie, the Harmony Hotel in Twentynine Palms, Zabriskie Point, Death Valley Junction, and other sites in Death Valley. Corbijn rented a panoramic camera to capture more of the desert landscapes, but having no prior experience with the camera, he was unfamiliar with how to focus it. This led to him focusing on the background and leaving the band slightly out of focus. Corbijn said, [...] "Fortunately {{there was a lot}} of light." [...] Averill filmed portions of the trip with an 8 mm film camera. The photo shoots took place in the mornings and evenings, with mid-days spent travelling and on preparation. Corbijn later recounted that the main idea of the shoot was to juxtapose [...] "man and environment, the Irish in America". Averill said of their photographic approach, [...] "What I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the way we shot the pictures and framed the cover was to suggest the landscape vision and cinematic approach that was taken to the recording." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1985, Waters {{declared}} that Pink Floyd were [...] "a spent force creatively". Gilmour and Mason {{responded with a}} press release stating that Waters had quit the band and they intended to continue without him. Gilmour assumed full control {{of the group and}} produced A Momentary Lapse of Reason in 1987, with some contributions from Mason and Richard Wright. Wright officially rejoined the band after the release of the album for a lengthy world tour and helped create 1994's The Division Bell. Gilmour explained: [...] "I had a number of problems with the direction of the band in our recent past, before Roger left. I thought the songs were very wordy and that, because the specific meanings of those words were so important, the music became a mere vehicle for lyrics, and not a very inspiring one. Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here were so successful not just because of Roger's contributions, but also because there was a better balance between the music and the lyrics than there has been in more recent albums. That's what I'm <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> A Momentary Lapse of Reason; more focus on the music, restore the balance." [...] In 1986, Gilmour purchased the houseboat Astoria, moored it on the River Thames near Hampton Court and transformed it into a recording studio. The majority of the two Pink Floyd albums released about this time, as well as Gilmour's 2006 solo release On an Island, were recorded there.|$|E
2500|$|The former {{trend in}} Disney's {{hand-drawn}} features where {{the characters and}} cinematography were influenced by a CGI-look has been abandoned. Andreas Deja, a veteran Disney animator who supervised the character of Mama Odie, says [...] "I always thought that maybe we should distinguish ourselves {{to go back to}} what 2D is good at, which is focusing on what the line can do rather than volume, which is a CG kind of thing. So we are doing less extravagant Treasure Planet kind of treatments. You have to create a world but [...] What we're <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Princess and the Frog is hook up with things that the old guys did earlier. It's not going to be graphic...". Deja also mentions that Lasseter was aiming for the Disney sculptural and dimensional look of the 1950s: [...] "All those things that were non-graphic, which means go easy on the straight lines and have one volume flow into the other– an organic feel to the drawing." [...] Lasseter also felt that traditional animation created more character believability. For example, with Louis the alligator, created by Eric Goldberg, Lasseter said: [...] "It's the believability of this large character being able to move around quite like that." [...] Choreographer Betsy Baytos was brought by the directors to lead a team of eccentric dancers that gave reference to make each character a different style of movement. The character design tried to create beautiful drawings through subtle shapes, particularly for most characters being human. For the frog versions of Tiana and Naveen, while the animators started with realistic designs, they eventually went for cutesy characters [...] "removing all that is unappealing in frogs", similar to Pinocchios Jiminy Cricket.|$|E

60|$|If secession be a right, {{then the}} moment of its {{exercise}} is wholly optional with those possessing it. Suppose, {{on the eve of}} a war with England, Michigan should vote herself out of the Union and declare herself annexed to Canada, what kind of a reception would her commissioners be likely to meet in Washington, and what scruples should we feel about coercion? Or, to take a case precisely parallel to that of South Carolina, suppose that Utah, after getting herself admitted to the Union, should resume her sovereignty, as it is pleasantly called, and block our path to the Pacific, under the pretence that she did not consider her institutions safe while the other States entertained such unscriptural prejudices against her special weakness in the patriarchal line. Is the only result of our admitting a Territory on Monday to be the giving it a right to steal itself and go out again on Tuesday? Or do only the original thirteen States possess this precious privilege of suicide? We shall need something like a Fugitive Slave Law for runaway republics, and must get a provision inserted in our treaties with foreign powers, that they shall help us catch any delinquent who may take refuge with them, as South Carolina has been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> England and France. It does not matter to the argument, except so far as the good taste of the proceeding is concerned, at what particular time a State may make her territory foreign, thus opening one gate of our national defences and offering a bridge to invasion. The danger of the thing is in her making her territory foreign under any circumstances; and it is a danger which the government must prevent, if only for self-preservation. Within the limits of the constitution two sovereignties cannot exist; and yet what practical odds does it make, if a State may become sovereign by simply declaring herself so? The legitimate consequence of secession is, not that a State becomes sovereign, but that, so far as the general government is concerned, she has outlawed herself, nullified her own existence as a State, and become an aggregate of riotous men who resist the execution of the laws.|$|E
