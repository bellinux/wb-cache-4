25|$|African trypanosomiasis, {{also known}} as {{sleeping}} sickness, is an insect-borne parasitic disease of humans and other animals. It is caused by protozoa of the species <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei.</b> There are two types that infect humans, <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei</b> gambiense (TbG) and <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei</b> rhodesiense (TbR). TbG causes over 98% of reported cases. Both are usually transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly and are most common in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{subspecies}} of {{the parasite}} {{that are responsible}} for starting the disease in humans. <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei</b> gambiense causes the diseases in west and central Africa, whereas <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei</b> rhodesiense has a limited geographical range and is responsible for causing the disease in east and southern Africa. In addition, a third subspecies of the parasite known as <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei</b> brucei is responsible for affecting animals but not humans.|$|E
25|$|The species <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei,</b> {{which causes}} the disease, {{has often been}} {{subdivided}} into three subspecies that were identified based either on the vertebrate hosts which the strain could infect or on the virulence of the disease in humans. The trypanosomes infectious to animals and not to humans were named <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei</b> brucei. Strains that infected humans {{were divided into two}} subspecies based on their different virulences: <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei</b> gambiense was thought to have a slower onset and <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei</b> rhodesiense refers to strains with a more rapid, virulent onset. This characterization has always been problematic but was the best that could be done given the knowledge of the time and the tools available for identification. A recent molecular study using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis suggests that the three subspecies are polyphyletic, so the elucidation of the strains of T. brucei infective to humans requires a more complex explanation. Procyclins are proteins developed in the surface coating of trypanosomes whilst in their tsetse fly vector.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} study, an {{extensive}} in vitro antimicrobial profiling was performed for three medicinal plants grown in Cuba, namely Simarouba glauca, Melaleuca leucadendron and Artemisia absinthium. Ethanol extracts were tested for their antiprotozoal potential against <b>Trypanosoma</b> b. <b>brucei,</b> <b>Trypanosoma</b> cruzi, Leishmania infantum and Plasmodium falciparum. Antifungal activities were evaluated against Microsporum canis and Candida albicans whereas Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus {{were used as}} test organisms for antibacterial activity. Cytotoxicity was assessed against human MRC- 5 cells. Only M. leucadendron extract showed selective activity against microorganisms tested. Although S. glauca exhibited strong activity against all protozoa, it must be considered non-specific. The value of integrated evaluation of extracts with particular reference to selectivity is discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism of <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei's</b> ODC with ornithine {{was characterized by}} UV-VIS spectroscopy {{in order to identify}} unique intermediates that occurred during the reaction. The specific method of multiwavelength stopped-flow spectroscopy utilized monochromatic light and fluorescence to identify five specific intermediates due to changes in absorbance measurements. The steady-state turnover number, kcat, of ODC was calculated to be 0.5 s-1 at 4 °C. From this characterization, the rate-limiting step was determined to be the release of the product putrescine from ODC's reaction with ornithine.In studying the hypothetical {{reaction mechanism}} for eflornithine, information collected from radioactive peptide and eflornithine mapping, high pressure liquid chromatography, and gas phase peptide sequencing suggested that Lys-69 and Cys-360 are covalently bound to eflornithine in T. brucei ODC's active site. Utilizing fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS), the structural conformation of eflornithine following its interaction with ODC was determined to be S-((2-(1-pyrroline-methyl) cysteine, a cyclic imine adduct. Presence of this particular product was supported by the possibility to further reduce the end product to S-((2-pyrrole) methyl) cysteine in the presence of NaBH4 and oxidize the end product to S-((2-pyrrolidine) methyl) cysteine (Figure 2).|$|R
40|$|Ten rabbits {{infected}} with <b>Trypanosoma</b> (Trypanozoon) <b>brucei</b> showed {{a substantial increase}} in a natural anti-tissue autoantibody and Wassermann antibody. Absorptions suggest that the liver and Wassermann antibodies are distinct. The liver antibody reacts equally well with homologous and autologous liver. Absorption with trypanosomes and liver show that cross-reacting trypanosomal antibodies are not responsible for the liver activity. These antibodies will contribute to the raised IgM levels of rabbit trypanosomiasis and may be important in this respect but the precise extent of the contribution is not known...|$|R
25|$|Human African trypanosomiasis, {{also called}} {{sleeping}} sickness, {{is caused by}} trypanosomes of the species <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei.</b> This disease is invariably fatal unless treated but can almost always be cured with current medicines, if the disease is diagnosed early enough.|$|E
25|$|Telomerase is {{a reverse}} {{transcriptase}} enzyme that carries its own RNA molecule (e.g., with the sequence 3′-CCCAAUCCC-5′ in <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei)</b> {{which is used}} as a template when it elongates telomeres.

25|$|Attacking obligate {{bacterial}} endosymbionts {{may present}} {{a way to}} control their insect hosts, many of which pests or carriers of human disease. For example, aphids are crop pests and the tsetse fly carries the organism <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei</b> that causes African sleeping sickness. Other motivations for their study is to understand symbiosis, and to understand how bacteria with severely depleted genomes are able to survive, thus improving our knowledge of genetics and molecular biology.|$|E

40|$|Bloodstream {{forms of}} <b>Trypanosoma</b> (Trypanozoon) <b>brucei</b> were {{observed}} in vitro to possess long filaments arising from both the posterior end and {{the tip of the}} flagellum, and also to become attached to various substrates, including themselves. The filaments were examined by negative staining and thin-section techniques and found to have a structure resembling filo-podia.

40|$|<b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei’s</b> {{mitochondrial}} genome, kinetoplast DNA (kDNA), {{is a giant}} {{network of}} catenated DNA rings. The network consists of a few thousand 1 kb minicircles and several dozen 23 kb maxicircles. Here we report that TbPIF 5, one of T. brucei’s six mitochondrial proteins related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial DNA helicase ScPIF 1, is involved in minicircle lagging strand synthesis. Like its yeast homolog, TbPIF 5 is a 59 to 39 DNA helicase. Together with other enzymes thought {{to be involved in}} Okazaki fragment processing, TbPIF 5 localizes in vivo to the antipodal sites flanking the kDNA. Minicircles in wild type cells replicate unidirectionally as theta-structures and are unusual in that Okazaki fragments are not joined until after the progeny minicircles have segregated. We now report that overexpression of TbPIF 5 causes premature removal of RNA primers and joining of Okazaki fragments on theta structures. Further elongation of the lagging strand is blocked, but the leading strand is completed and the minicircle progeny, one with a truncated H strand (ranging from 0. 1 to 1 kb), are segregated. The minicircles with a truncated H strand electrophorese on an agarose gel as a smear. This replication defect is associated with kinetoplast shrinkage and eventual slowing of cell growth. We propose that TbPIF 5 unwinds RNA primers after lagging strand synthesis, thus facilitating processing of Okazaki fragments...|$|R
500|$|The {{mechanisms}} used {{to evade}} the adaptive immune system are more complicated. The simplest approach is to rapidly change non-essential epitopes (amino acids and/or sugars) {{on the surface of}} the pathogen, while keeping essential epitopes concealed. This is called antigenic variation. An example is HIV, which mutates rapidly, so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing. These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus. The parasite <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei</b> uses a similar strategy, constantly switching one type of surface protein for another, allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response. Masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system. In HIV, the envelope that covers the virion is formed from the outermost membrane of the host cell; such [...] "self-cloaked" [...] viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them as [...] "non-self" [...] structures.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} induction of a programmed {{cell death}} (PCD) in <b>Trypanosoma</b> b. <b>brucei</b> by 55 alkaloids of the quinoline, quinolizidine, isoquinoline, indole, terpene, tropane, steroid, and piperidine type was studied by measuring DNA fragmentation and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. For comparison, the induction of apoptosis by the same alkaloids in human leukemia cells (Jurkat APO-S) was tested. Several alkaloids of the isoquinoline, quinoline, indole and steroidal type (berberine, chelerythrine, emetine, sanguinarine, quinine, ajmalicine, ergotamine, harmine, vinblastine, vincristine, colchicine, chaconine, demissidine and veratridine) induced {{programmed cell death}}, whereas quinolizidine, tropane, terpene and piperidine alkaloids were mostly inactive. Effective PCD induction (EC 50 below 10 Ã‚ÂµM) was caused in T. brucei by chelerythrine, emetine, sanguinarine, and chaconine. The active alkaloids can be characterized by their general property to inhibit protein biosynthesis, to intercalate DNA, to disturb membrane fluidity or to inhibit microtubule formation...|$|R

40|$|We report {{here the}} {{characterization}} of the gene coding for AnTat 1. 13, a very late variable antigen type (VAT) from <b>Trypanosoma</b> b. <b>brucei.</b> This gene is chromosome-internal and it is activated by the duplicative mechanism. Like in another case of late VAT expression (1), its expression-linked copy (ELC) is flanked by "companion" sequences. It was possible to convert the late expression of this VAT into an early one, by changing {{the location of the}} gene in the genome. This has been achieved by selecting an AnTat 1. 6 clone among heterotypes arising in the AnTat 1. 13 cloned population. Indeed, this particular derivation leads to the conservation of the AnTat 1. 13 ELC as a new telomeric member of the gene family, and this conserved ELC (or ex-ELC) appears to be preferentially activable. The telomeric position and other factors possibly involved in early or late antigen gene expression are discussed; in this respect, we propose that some antigen genes are rarely activated because their duplicative transposition requires the presence, in the expression site, of "companion" sequences only shared by a limited number of other genes.

The protein sequence contains the six conserved regions that have been recognized previously in eukaryotic and viral replicative DNA polymerases. In addition, we have identified a seventh region which appears to be conserved primarily in alpha-type DNA polymerases. The T. brucei DNA pol alpha core N-terminus is 123 and 129 amino acids smaller than that of the human and yeast homologue, respectively. The gene is separated by 386 bp from an upstream open reading frame (ORF) of 442 codons. Stable transcripts of the upstream sequence are detected in both dividing and non-dividing forms, while pol alpha transcripts are detected principally in dividing forms. Allelic copies of the T. brucei pol alpha region exhibit restriction site polymorphisms; one such sequence polymorphism affects the amino acid sequence of the T. brucei DNA pol alpha core.

40|$|The {{increasing}} need {{of oil and}} {{the negative}} impacts of fossil fuels on climate change have motivated the research towards environmental friendly alternatives to diminish the use of fossil resources. Until today, bioethanol production and use has increased worldwide. The raw materials used today compete with food industry and conquently, the ethanol production from lignocellulose has been developed intensively. However, to make the processes economically competitive, also pentoses in lignocellulose should be fermented at high rate. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, alias baker’s yeast has an excellent ethanol production capacity {{but it can not}} naturally utilize xylose. Several xylose-utilizing S. cerevisiae strains have been constructed; however the fermentation rate is still lower than that of hexose sugars. The major obstacles are thought to be the xylose transport, ATP depletion during the fermentation and the redox imbalance due to the different cofactor specifities of xylose reductase (XR) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) enzymes in the xylose utilization pathway. This thesis includes three separate studies related to xylose metabolism of recombinant S. cerevisiae. In the first part the aim was to set up a high throughput xylose uptake assay by overexpressing a gene encoding β-xylosidase enzyme from Tricoderma reesei in S. cerevisiae. The experimental part included the enzyme activity measurements by using commercial xylose analogue p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside, which creates yellow colour when hydrolyzed with β-xylosidase. In the second study <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>brucei’s</b> NADH dependent fumarate reductase (FRDg) encoding gene was overexpressed in xylose utilizing S. cerevisiae in order to improve ethanol fermentation by providing intracellular NAD+ for the XDH reaction. Aerobic and anaerobic shake flask cultivations were carried out with the constructed strains. The xylose utilization and metabolite and ethanol productivities were measured with high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). In the third part of the study, XR and XDH activities were measured spectrophotometrically from the xylose-utilizing yeast strains from the VTT Culture collection. The aim {{of the study was to}} find new enzymes to be exploited in the engineering of xylose metabolism of S. cerevisiea. The xylose transporter assay was not functional. The BXL 1 gene was expressed in yeast, but no β-xylosidase activity was detected. The expression of FRDg slightly improved the xylose fermentation in xylose-utizing S. cerevisiae but the activity measurements did not show FRDg activity. In the XR and XDH activity measurements of strains from the VTT Culture collection a couple of strains with potentially interesting XR and XDH activities were found.

40|$|In the <b>Trypanosoma</b> b. <b>brucei</b> AnTat 1. 1 C clone, {{the gene}} coding for the variant-specific surface antigen is {{telomeric}} and {{appears as a}} hybrid sequence, partially modified by gene conversion. This conversion {{is very similar to}} that observed in another AnTat 1. 1 -expressor clone (AnTat 1. 1 B). This sequence is not activated by duplicative transposition, although it could be activated by duplication in another clone (AnTat 1. 10). Instead activation of the AnTat 1. 1 C gene seems operated by reciprocal recombination between its own telomere and the telomere carrying the previous (AnTat 1. 16) ELC. Indeed, from the switch to AnTat 1. 1 C onward, the AnTat 1. 16 ELC becomes a new silent member of its gene family, whereas in the variant directly derived from AnTat 1. 1 C (AnTat 1. 3 B), the AnTat 1. 1 C-containing telomere is lost, probably replaced by a large duplicate, at least 40 kb long, of the AnTat 1. 3 gene-containing telomere. Different DNA rearrangement mechanisms used by the trypanosome to change its antigenic type thus contribute, by gain and loss of genes, to the evolution of the repertoire for surface antigens.
