40|$|A multi-agent {{autonomous}} system for exploration of hazardous or inaccessible locations. The multi-agent {{autonomous system}} includes simple surface-based agents or craft controlled by an airborne <b>tracking</b> <b>and</b> command system. <b>The</b> airborne <b>tracking</b> <b>and</b> command system includes an instrument suite used to image an operational area and any craft deployed within the operational area. The image data {{is used to}} identify the craft, targets for exploration, and obstacles in the operational area. <b>The</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>and</b> command system determines paths for the surface-based craft using the identified targets and obstacles and commands the craft using simple movement commands {{to move through the}} operational area to the targets while avoiding the obstacles. Each craft includes its own instrument suite to collect information about the operational area that is transmitted back to <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>and</b> command system. <b>The</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>and</b> command system may be further coupled to a satellite system to provide additional image information about the operational area and provide operational and location commands to <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>and</b> command system...|$|R

5|$|After the {{municipal}} merger between Oslo and Aker in 1948, Akersbanerne was merged into Oslo Sporveier, although Holmenkolbanen remained a partially owned subsidiary. In 1973, Oslo Sporveier bought the remaining shares, {{and two years}} later the operations were transferred to Oslo Sporveier, with Holmenkolbanen remaining a pure real estate company. The municipal take-over resulted in an upgrade to both <b>the</b> <b>track</b> <b>and</b> the rolling stock. New overhead wires and new and heavier track were laid. From 1978, the T1300 trains were taken into use. With the take-over, the lines were numbered, and the Sognsvann Line designated 81, although this was quickly changed to 13.|$|E

5|$|As {{compensation}} for removing <b>the</b> <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field sections, the stadium company {{had to pay}} for a new municipal athletics venue at Mørkvedlia. The sales stadium's contract also required Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling to build new change room facilities for the training pitch so the uses from teams had the same quality as the main pitch.
