5|$|In 1960, the U.S. Air Force {{made plans}} to close Ladd Airfield and {{transfer}} its functions to nearby Eielson Air Force Base and Elmendorf Air Force Base near Anchorage. When the decision was publicly announced, it was met with almost unanimous opposition by Fairbanks residents and businesses in the area. Although the Air Force held firm in its decision to <b>transfer</b> <b>out</b> of the base, the U.S. Army took over the post on January 1, 1961 and renamed it Fort Wainwright.|$|E
5|$|On March 18, 2003, Owumi {{signed a}} letter of intent to play college {{football}} for Georgetown. He joined the team on a scholarship under head coach Bob Benson, uncertain of his future in basketball. Although Owumi had initially desired to play the quarterback position, his coaches wanted him to play wide receiver due to his athletic abilities. He later moved to being a safety and eventually became the Hoyas' third-string quarterback, {{but he would not}} officially play the position. Following the football season, Owumi often practiced with the school's basketball team but never joined. He decided to <b>transfer</b> <b>out</b> of Georgetown to focus on academics and basketball, retaining his four years of college basketball eligibility.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland's {{pre-season}} {{was busy}} with transfer activity, seeing eight players come in, and five players leave. Kenny Cunningham retired, Tommy Miller, William Mocquet, Kevin Smith were released, while Robbie Weir, Jamie Chandler and David Dowson were all promoted to the first team from the club's youth system. Their first signing of the season was of Greg Halford from Charlton Athletic, and their first <b>transfer</b> <b>out</b> of the club when Stephen Elliott moved to Wolverhampton Wanderers. On 13 July 2007, Sunderland signed the former Newcastle United player Michael Chopra from Cardiff City for £5 million and Manchester United midfielder Kieran Richardson on 16 July.|$|E

5|$|No. 1 Squadron began {{receiving}} new Demons in November 1936. In January 1937, it relinquished its Bulldogs to No.21 Squadron, {{which was}} to hold them until they could {{be transferred to the}} soon-to-be-formed No.2 Squadron. By the end of February, No.1 Squadron's strength was 12 Demons and one Moth, 11 officers and 108 airmen. The unit was redesignated No.1 (Bomber) Squadron in August 1937. Towards the end of the year, it was plagued by several Demon accidents, resulting in a series of inquiries and a review of RAAF procedures in 1938 by Marshal of the RAF Sir Edward Ellington; the so-called Ellington Report and its criticism of air safety standards led to the removal of Air Vice-Marshal Richard Williams from his position as Chief of the Air Staff, which he had held since the formation of the Air Force. No.1 Squadron received the RAAF's first three CAC Wirraways on 10July 1939. As the likelihood of war increased, the squadron's role was altered to incorporate reconnaissance as well as bombing, resulting in the <b>transfer</b> <b>out</b> of all Demons and Wirraways and the transfer in from other units of nine Avro Ansons on 28–29 August 1939; {{at the end of the}} month its personnel comprised nine officers and 122 airmen.|$|E

25|$|Eleven {{hospitals}} suffered {{structural damage}} and were damaged or rendered unusable. Not only were they unable {{to serve their}} local neighborhoods, but they also had to <b>transfer</b> <b>out</b> their inpatient populations, which further increased the burden on nearby hospitals that were still operational. As a result, the state legislature passed a law requiring all hospitals in California {{to ensure that their}} acute care units and emergency rooms would be in earthquake-resistant buildings by January 1, 2005. Most were unable to meet this deadline and only managed to achieve compliance in 2008 or 2009.|$|E

25|$|Admission is {{determined}} {{by a combination of}} a student's score on the Independent School Entrance Examination (ISEE) and recent grades, and is limited to residents of the city of Boston. Although Boston Latin runs from the 7th through the 12th grade, it only admits students into the 7th and 9th grades. Consequently, the higher grades have fewer students than the lower grades, as a relatively large number of students <b>transfer</b> <b>out.</b> The school has historically been described as having a sink-or-swim environment, but in recent years there have been notable efforts to create a more supportive atmosphere.|$|E

The admission tests for DRMC are highly competitive. Students in these grades are admitted through written and viva voce tests for both the morning and day shifts. Students who pass the written test have to qualify in the viva exam. In addition to written and viva tests, candidates {{have to go through}} a medical examination as well.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 2007, Gus Malzahn, the {{offensive}} coordinator and Mustain's {{former high school}} coach, announced he was leaving the Razorbacks to join the University of Tulsa. The day after Malzahn's announcement, January 16, 2007, Mustain requested permission to transfer to another university and it was, subsequently, granted by Coach Nutt. The announcement was {{one year to the}} day after Mustain had initially announced his decision to sign with the Razorbacks out of high school. Nutt had initially refused Mustain's request to <b>transfer</b> <b>out.</b> After the initial denial, Mustain went to two Arkansas boosters for guidance, and they and his mother, Beck Campbell, followed up with Nutt to ask for the transfer, which he then agreed to.|$|E

Ida, however, cannot <b>transfer</b> <b>out</b> of the city and would have to quit teaching to go. He debates doing it as he would lose his job anyway if someone found out he was gay, but eventually decides not to as teaching is his life dream.

He quit the Kyoto job and found one instead there in Tokyo, and asks Ida to live with him. Heartbroken, Kobayashi runs off. Eventually he gets over the rejection and remains friends with Ida, visiting him at school and acting as his confidant about his relationship with Hashizume.|$|E
25|$|General Brusilov's initial {{orders were}} for Austrian laws {{to remain in}} effect and for Austrian {{officials}} to continue their duties – {{in the name of}} the Russian tsar instead of the Austrian emperor – as long as they would not be suspected of possible treason to the new Russian authorities. This policy proved difficult, because many Austrian officials had fled, and because the loyalty to Russia of those who remained was in doubt. Initially local Galician Russophiles were used to staff positions. However, in time the bureaucracy came to be staffed overwhelmingly by officlals transferred in from neighboring regions of the Russian Empire. As often happens in such reassignments, the bureaucrats of the neighboring regions took advantage of the opportunity to <b>transfer</b> <b>out</b> those with the least amount of ability, experience, education as well as those who caused trouble. As a result, in addition to understaffing the Russian administration in Galicia suffered from poor quality in personnel. Many of the transferees belonged to right-wing Russian nationalist parties who espoused anti-Semitism as well as hostility towards Ukrainians and Poles.|$|E
500|$|However, as {{the season}} progressed, head coach Seth Greenberg began giving Garland fewer minutes. Following the {{recovery}} of freshman Marquis Rankin from a torn meniscus, Garland played a total of one minute in three games. He also scored a combined six points following his initial two performances that season. On December 11, 2011, Garland did not even remove his warm-up shirt in his team's game vs Norfolk State. When Greenberg was asked about Garland's playing time, the coach said, [...] "Marquis [...] is right now a good play-starter and good on ball defender. We've got to get other guys more minutes". When asked a similar question the day before, he said that [...] "you can't play 13 guys". On December 16, 2011, Garland announced on Twitter that {{he was planning to}} <b>transfer</b> <b>out</b> of Virginia Tech. Following his exams, he returned to his hometown of Philadelphia. Garland became the third men's basketball player to <b>transfer</b> <b>out</b> of the Hokies' team in the past academic year, following the footsteps of Ben Boggs, who moved to Valparaiso, and Manny Atkins, who would end up with Georgia State. Garland finished his sophomore year at Virginia Tech averaging 4.6 points, 1.3 assists, and 1.3 turnovers in eight appearances. In late December 2011, he began competing for La Salle. Explorers head coach John Giannini said, [...] "We recruited Tyrone extremely hard out of high school. He is known as a scorer and can also be a very good passer and defender. He is the type of all-around guard, talent and person that will make our team better. He gives us an experienced player to continue our growth over the next 2 years. With his addition we will have tremendous team quickness and depth." [...] Several of the team's top scorers in 2011–12 had experience playing high school basketball in the Philadelphia Public and Catholic Leagues.|$|E

2500|$|The mass brawl {{was played}} {{out in front of}} the Spanish King Juan Carlos and an {{audience}} of 100,000 fans inside the stadium, and more than half of Spain watching on television. Sixty people were injured, with the incident effectively sealing Maradona's <b>transfer</b> <b>out</b> of the club in what was his last game in a Barcelona shirt. One Barcelona executive stated, [...] "When I saw those scenes of Maradona fighting and the chaos that followed I realized we couldn't go any further with him." [...] Maradona got into frequent disputes with FC Barcelona executives, particularly club president Josep Lluís Núñez, culminating with a demand to be transferred out of Camp Nou in 1984. During his two injury-hit seasons at Barcelona, Maradona scored 38 goals in 58 games. Maradona transferred to Napoli in Italy's Serie A for another world record fee, £6.9 million ($10.48M).|$|E
2500|$|The army units already {{engaged in}} theater were {{suffering}} from a personnel shortage. The army had no system for providing replacement soldiers for unit losses. In May 1918, the army offered privates the opportunity to volunteer for duty overseas by agreeing to <b>transfer</b> <b>out</b> of the 39th Division. In the rush to help end the war, officers resigned their commissions so they would qualify for duty overseas before the war was over. Shortly thereafter, Private Robert Springer was the first state guardsman to lose his life in France. [...] Approximately 20 percent of the soldiers of the 39th Division were allowed to volunteer to deploy as individual replacements. In June 1918 the individual replacements arrived in France.
