We begin by situating the <b>travel</b> <b>blogs</b> in the taxonomy of tourism texts presented in Calvi (2010). Then, we will describe in more detail the different dimensions of this genre: its communicative purposes, its most typical rhetorical moves {{and the way the}} participants in the communicative event are profiled. The empirical material comes from a pilot corpus on <b>travel</b> <b>blogs,</b> written by Spanish-speaking tourists in Belgium, which were all published in the community blog...|$|R

The growth and popularity of <b>travel</b> <b>blogs</b> over the Internet influenced few tourism researchers to see the online narratives as valuable sources of information for destination marketing. This research analyzed the content of <b>travel</b> <b>blogs</b> related to trips to Stratford, Canada to establish the most talked about topics and the experiences surrounding these. Three phases of data analysis were completed to achieve both quantifiable and qualitative results reflecting the travel experiences. The findings suggest that Stratford is primarily seen as a cultural and culinary destination. Methodological and practical implications are discussed...|$|R

50|$|In the 21st century, travel {{literature}} {{became a}} genre of social {{media in the}} form of <b>travel</b> <b>blogs,</b> with <b>travel</b> bloggers using outlets like personal blogs, Pinterest, Twitter, and Instagram to convey information about their adventures, and provide advice for navigating particular countries, or for traveling generally. <b>Travel</b> <b>blogs</b> were among the first instances of blogging, which began in the mid 1990s.|$|R
40|$|Amateur <b>travel</b> <b>blogs</b> hosted on advertising-sponsored {{websites}} {{are generally}} viewed as credible {{sources of information}} about tourist behaviour and destination image, particularly as the content is user-generated. Little is said, however, about the webhost-created content. It is generally assumed that the content and features of a blog reveal {{a good deal about}} its author. In the case of <b>travel</b> <b>blogs,</b> however, this can be problematic as both webhosts and authors create content. This paper examines formal and paratextual features of amateur <b>travel</b> <b>blogs</b> to analyse the extent of the contribution made by the webhost and its influence on authorial voice. In particular, it considers titles, links, and advertising in <b>travel</b> <b>blogs</b> hosted on Travelpod, Travelblog, and Bootsnall. It finds that the webhost plays a significant part in positioning the text as a narrative about a particular destination. Furthermore, not all the features of these blogs transfer a sense of who has authored them...|$|R

40|$|<b>Travel</b> <b>blogs</b> {{constitute}} a new platform where travelers can tell about their travel experiences and share information and impressions with their readers. Most <b>travel</b> <b>blogs</b> incorporate commenting capabilities, which enable social interaction {{among members of}} communities with shared traveling interests. English is most often used as a Lingua Franca, facilitating interaction among people with different L 1 backgrounds and transcending the native/non-native distinction. The purpose {{of this research is}} to analyze the features of English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) interactions in <b>travel</b> <b>blogs</b> and explore some strategies used by participants in blog discussions to achieve shared understanding and show belonging to an ELF community. The small corpus consists of 36 blog discussions taken from 12 blogs where the commenters belong to different L 1 backgrounds.

He posits a critique socio-linguistics where online multimodal texts are analyzed by identifying layers of analysis. Against these compositional models, Calzati suggests a double move: on the one hand, he applies Gérard Genette 2 ̆ 7 s notion of 2 ̆ 2 paratext 2 ̆ 2 to <b>travel</b> <b>blogs</b> {{and on the other}} he extends the concept of 2 ̆ 2 hypertextuality 2 ̆ 2 to travel books. From his analyzis it emerges that in <b>travel</b> <b>blogs</b> hosted on platforms paratextual elements tend to invade the space of the text and challenge the blogger 2 ̆ 7 s authority. At the same time, travel books turn out to be more hypertextual than <b>travel</b> <b>blogs</b> hosted on platforms. Calzati 2 ̆ 7 s study is complemented by interviews with a selection of travel writers which show that bloggers whose blogs are on platforms have a weak awareness of the potentialities of the medium and that their media-related choices are often arbitrary.

40|$|Blogs are {{generally}} described as self-presentational and comprising multiple discourses, and <b>travel</b> <b>blogs</b> are often studied for what tourists say {{about themselves and}} places they visit. Yet, little is written about the discourses of travel and tourism informing the narratives of <b>travel</b> <b>blogs</b> or how they influence the presentation of travel bloggers and their travel experiences. Also, much contemporary research uses the terms ‘travel’ and ‘tourism’ interchangeably despite evidence of a dichotomy of traveller and tourist manifest in discourse. Travel is generally regarded as being more authentic, adventurous, and worthy of admiration than tourism, which is perceived as being superficial, passive, and has commercial motivations. Several discursive analyses of forms of travel-related communication indicate that authors use specific narrative techniques to present the self as a traveller and associate their texts with a travel experience {{as opposed to a}} touristic one. Conversely, the narrative style of tourist discourse has commercial associations and a promotional purpose. Against this background, this thesis examines the discursive tension between travel and tourism and analyses how narrative techniques negotiate this in <b>travel</b> <b>blogs.</b> The central research question this thesis asks is: How do <b>travel</b> <b>blogs</b> negotiate the tensions between discourses of travel and tourism? The response to this involves a discursive analysis of a <b>travel</b> <b>blogs</b> using various theories of narrative and self-presentation, particularly Bakhtin’s heteroglossia, polyphony, and speech genres, Goffman’s theories of self-presentation, and Graham Dann’s framework for tourist discourse. Through this analysis, the thesis extends previous studies of the discursive construction of the traveller/tourist debate to a recently evolved form of travel-related communication. It finds that the underlying discursive tensions in <b>travel</b> <b>blogs</b> indicate a need for a more flexible approach to defining and analysing this form of communication...|$|R
