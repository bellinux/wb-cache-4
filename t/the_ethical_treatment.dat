40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, {{advertisements}} have objectified and sexualized women as a tactic to attract men into supporting causes and buying products. This research project focuses on the advertisements published by the animal rights group, PETA, People for <b>the</b> <b>Ethical</b> <b>Treatments</b> of Animals, and its deliberate use of degrading images of women to support its cause. PETA advertisements juxtapose barely clad women with animals or animal references, making the viewer see women as animalistic, out of control, {{and in need of}} taming or saving. Research shows that the results of such negative advertising tactics are correlated with increased aggression in male viewers, as well as increased acceptance of rape attitudes among men. Sexualized and objectified images take away from the purpose of the animal rights movement, making the audience reluctant to support the cause. Furthermore, these advertisements seriously jeopardize and undermine the women 2 ̆ 7 s fight for equality in our culture. [URL]...|$|R

On the contrary, the ‘war on terror’ has {{made it very clear that}} states which have been central to supporting the expansion and deepening of human rights, and that apparently have a continuing commitment to the realisation of human rights norms, are themselves among the violators of human rights. Critical Sociologists should therefore consider the possibility that there are links between this proliferation of discourses on human rights and human rights violations...|$|R

40|$|A great fire {{seized a}} suburb {{in a small}} town in Sweden in the autumn of 2011. Parts of a {{shopping}} mall were burnt to the ground by youngsters.

It {{was the first}} expressly codified law that expressly forbade giving [...] "no quarter" [...] to the enemy (i.e., killing prisoners of war), except in such cases when {{the survival of the}} unit that held these prisoners was threatened. It forbade the use of poisons, stating that use of such puts any force who uses them entirely outside the pale of the civilized nations and peoples; it forbade the use of torture to extract confessions; it described the rights and duties of prisoners of war and of capturing forces. It described the state of war, the state of occupied territories, and the ends of war, and discusses permissible and impermissible means to attain those ends; it discussed the nature of states and sovereignties, and insurrections, rebellions, and wars. As such, it is widely considered to be the first written recital of the customary law of war, in force between the civilized nations and peoples since time immemorial, and the precursor to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the treaty-based restatement of the customary law of war.|$|R

40|$|To copy {{or not to}} copy, {{to exploit}} the famous celebrity image or not to exploit it; these are the questions. The message of the modern legal world communicated through {{multiple}} voices in the academy is that copying often is perfectly acceptable and even laudable. An artist or designer might conclude that it is both legal and ethical to use whatever you can, use whatever {{you can get away}} with, and use it until you get sued for using it. Yet plagiarism in the arts and sciences is nearly universally condemned. This Article proposes an <b>ethical</b> approach to <b>the</b> use of copyrighted works and names, images, and likenesses protected by the right of publicity. This approach is based on <b>the</b> <b>ethical</b> requirements of <b>the</b> law as synthesized from the cases presenting concrete narratives concerning fair and appropriate uses of protected works, names, and images. My thesis may be summed up in a revised form of the KISS principle (Keep it simple, stupid!) known as "DIOS MIO: Don’t Include Other’s Stuff or Modify It Obviously". Although simplified to this acronym, <b>the</b> <b>ethical</b> considerations concerning copyright-protected works and right of publicity-protected names and images are far from simple. The advice of this Article reflects the convergence of predominant purpose analysis and transformative/transformation analysis in copyright and right of publicity law that has led to a single set of recommendations for <b>the</b> legal and <b>ethical</b> <b>treatment</b> of protected works and celebrity names, images, and likenesses: seek first to create and not to copy or exploit, and create new expression by obvious modification of the old expression and content...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Intraoperative care {{includes}} a unique {{knowledge of how}} to perform a safe and effective surgery procedure. Surgery performed under regional or local anaesthesia allows the patient to remain conscious during the procedure and is rather common in Swedish healthcare today. Aim: The aim was to obtain {{a deeper understanding of the}} main concerns of operating theatre nurses (OTN) when caring for conscious patients during the intraoperative phase. Methods: Interviews were conducted with 23 OTNs from five different hospitals in Sweden and analysed according to grounded theory. Findings: The main concern among the OTNs was to take the patient in consideration. The core category “achieve and maintain <b>ethical</b> <b>treatment</b> of patients” in the operating theatre (OT) was a strategy used throughout <b>the</b> intraoperative process. <b>Ethical</b> <b>treatment</b> was described as moral behaviour at different levels and included the team’s behaviour, respectful and individualised patientcare, and the working-morale of the professionals. Being vigilant and being flexible were the categories related to the core category. The OTNs constantly assessed where to pay most attention as they balanced between the needs of the patient, the team, and the surgery procedure. Conclusion: It is important that every patient is taken into consideration and that ethical principles are held to the highest standards in the OT. A familiar team can facilitate that. The complex skills that operating theatre nurses develop can be added to explain important competencies within the profession...|$|R
