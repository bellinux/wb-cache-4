5|$|That same year, a {{group of}} liberal ministers {{composed}} a statement defending their theological views known as the Auburn Affirmation {{due to the fact}} that it was based on the work of Robert Hastings Nichols of Auburn Seminary. Citing the Adopting Act of 1729, <b>the</b> <b>Affirmation</b> claimed for the PCUSA a heritage of doctrinal liberty. It also argued that church doctrine could only be established by action of the General Assembly and a majority of presbyteries; therefore, according to <b>the</b> <b>Affirmation,</b> the General Assembly acted unconstitutionally when it required adherence to the five fundamentals.|$|E

5000|$|Hugh Urban links <b>the</b> <b>Affirmations</b> with <b>the</b> magical {{practices}} that Hubbard participated in while {{a member of}} the OTO.

Indeed, one of <b>the</b> <b>Affirmations</b> is [...] "that my magical work is powerful and effective". During his stay with Parsons, Hubbard had come to regard himself as an adept or [...] "magus", an enlightened spiritual being existing on a higher spiritual plane {{than the rest of the}} human race. Urban highlights Hubbard's repeated invocations of the Guardian, his spiritual adviser. This concept is drawn directly from Aleister Crowley's book Magick in Theory and Practice, which advocates that [...] "adepts" [...] should make it a priority to get in touch with their Guardian. [...] Like Crowley's Magick, Hubbard's Affirmations assert that he was all-powerful and invulnerable because of his contact with the Guardian: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Phoenix <b>Affirmations</b> {{take on a}} {{threefold}} structure, {{based on}} the Three Great Loves identified by Jesus and affirmed within Judaism: Love of God, Love of Neighbor, and Love of Self. (Matthew 22:34-40//Mark 12:28-31//Luke 10:25-28; cf. Deuteronomy 6:5; Leviticus 19:18)The Phoenix Affirmations {{are not meant to}} be a static set of principles to stand for all time. The authors attached a version number to them—currently 3.8—indicating that <b>the</b> <b>Affirmations</b> are <b>the</b> product of continual modification and may be amended in the future in light of new awareness and deeper understanding of what is believed to be God’s call. In contrast to a Creed, <b>the</b> <b>Affirmations</b> are not meant to serve as a test of faith against which a person’s Christian commitments are to be verified. Diana Butler Bass described <b>the</b> Phoenix <b>Affirmations</b> as follows: [...] "Together, they spell out the theological basis of Protestant liberality: being open and humble, yet grounded in the biblical story of God's dream for humankind." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{exclusion}} of Catalan from the Occitan sphere, even though Catalan is closely related, is justified {{because there has}} been a consciousness of its being different from Occitan since the later Middle Ages and because the elaboration (Ausbau) processes of Catalan and Occitan (including Gascon) have been quite distinct since the 20th century. Nevertheless, other scholars point out that the process that led to <b>the</b> <b>affirmation</b> of Catalan as a distinct language from Occitan started during the period when the pressure to include Catalan-speaking areas in a mainstream Spanish culture was at its greatest.|$|E

During this time there were only two documented visits: in 1652 and 1654, respectively the visit of Queen Luísa de Gusmão and King John IV of Portugal (1640–1656) and the final burial of King Afonso VI.|$|E
25|$|Scholars such as Ulrich Luz and {{separately}} Dale Allison {{view the}} pericope as instrumental in asserting the divinity of Jesus among early Christians.

Dale Allison states that Matthew's presentation emphasizes that God the Father is willing to share divine power with his son and that the impact of this pericope on <b>the</b> <b>affirmation</b> of the divinity of Jesus in the ecumenical creeds is undeniable.|$|E

They consist of a series of statements by and addressed to Hubbard, relating to various physical, sexual, psychological and social issues that he was encountering in his life.

In fact, the linguistic situation in Luxembourg was characterised by trilingualism: Lëtzebuergesch was the spoken vernacular language, German the written language, in which Luxembourgers were most fluent, and French the language of official letters and law.|$|E

The tragedies Benk bot and Zvonimir display vices and rapacity of Hungarian landlords and court. Marković also wrote poems, literary critics and studies.

25|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>affirmation</b> by voters, {{traditional}} museums {{found themselves}} in a prolonged crisis beginning in the late 1960s. Not limited to Basel, this crisis originated in the profound sociopolitical reevaluation of culture of the era. The acquisitions of the State Art Credit and the 1967 Christmas exhibition at Kunsthalle Basel set off fierce protests among the loosely organized association of rejected artists, which became known as the Farnsburg Group (Farnsburgergruppe). Even the cantonal parliament got involved in addressing the concerns. The events raised the question of whether Basel was “just a museum city” – here meant in a derogatory sense – and prompted a broadly cast debate over the fostering of young artists and the functioning of the museums. The establishment of the Klingental Exhibition Gallery (Ausstellungsraum Klingental) several years later was a direct consequence of the shortcomings that had been identified.|$|E

25|$|The Coalition {{changed its}} name to Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia (Coalition of Parties for Democracy) and put forward Patricio Aylwin, a Christian Democrat who had opposed Allende, as presidential candidate, and also {{proposed}} a list of candidates for the parliamentary elections. The opposition and the Pinochet government made several negotiations to amend the Constitution and agreed to 54 modifications. These amendments changed the way the Constitution would be modified in the future, added restrictions to state of emergency dispositions, <b>the</b> <b>affirmation</b> of political pluralism, and enhanced constitutional rights as well as the democratic principle and participation to political life. In July 1989, a referendum on the proposed changes took place, supported by all the parties except the right-wing Southern Party and the instrumental Chilean Socialist Party (created by the dictatorship to confuse voters). The Constitutional changes were approved by 91.25% of the voters.|$|E
25|$|The two {{accused in}} the case were already in police custody while the {{skeletal}} remains of the young children were being unearthed from behind {{and in front of}} Pandher's residence. An FIR had been filed on 7 October 2006. Investigations revealed that Payal's cellphone was being used although the SIM card she owned remained inactive. Through digital surveillance, the investigators were able to track down a number of people and could finally reach the man who sold the phone. The rickshaw cart puller affirmed that the phone belonged to someone from the Pandher residence. After <b>the</b> <b>affirmation</b> of the facts by the witness, Moninder Singh was called for interrogation, which subsequently revealed nothing.

25|$|With <b>the</b> <b>affirmation</b> of the Romanian nation, in {{the context}} of the European {{revolutions}} of 1848, was explicitly questioned the issue on university in national language. At the express request of the Romanians, in 1870, József Eötvös, then Minister of Education, proposes the creation in Cluj of a university teaching in Hungarian, Romanian and German, idea also welcomed by the Romanian elite. Meanwhile, Eötvös dies, and in 1872, Franz Joseph I legislates the establishment of the Hungarian Royal University of Kolozsvár in Hungarian only, which caused dissatisfaction among Romanians. After the oath, on 20 December 1872, 258 students start courses. There were created four distinct faculties: Faculty of Law and State Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Philosophy, Letters and History, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. The faculties were equal to each other and enjoyed internal autonomy. The first rector was Professor Áron Berde from the Faculty of Law, specialist in economics and finance. Besides the four faculties is created a Pedagogical Institute, for training secondary school teachers. From 1895 the girls had the right to learn at university.|$|E
