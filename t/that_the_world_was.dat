5|$|It rained. The {{procession}} of weary soldiers became a bedraggled train, despondent and muttering, marching with churning effort in a trough of liquid brown mud under a low, wretched sky. Yet the youth smiled, for he saw <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> a world for him, though many discovered {{it to be}} made of oaths and walking sticks. He had rid himself of the red sickness of battle. The sultry nightmare was in the past. He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of war. He turned now with a lover's thirst to images of tranquil skies, fresh meadows, cool brooks, an existence of soft and eternal peace.|$|E
25|$|Greek {{philosophers}} such as Porphyry, {{who claimed}} influence from Platonism, and {{the fathers of}} the Christian Church, held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> pervaded with spirits, the latter of whom advanced the belief that demons received the worship directed at pagan gods.|$|E

25|$|Francis preached the Christian {{doctrine}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> created {{good and}} beautiful by God but suffers {{a need for}} redemption because of human sin.

25|$|Brave New World Revisited (Harper & Brothers, US, 1958; Chatto & Windus, UK, 1959), {{written by}} Huxley {{almost thirty years}} after Brave New World, is a non-fiction work in which Huxley {{considered}} whether the world had moved toward or away from {{his vision of the}} future from the 1930s. He believed when he wrote the original novel that it was a reasonable guess as to where the world might go in the future. In Brave New World Revisited, he concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> becoming like Brave New World much faster than he originally thought.|$|E

25|$|The notion for education-based {{workshops}} and displays developed {{out of a}} philosophical view; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> heading towards difficult times and that people needed {{to learn how to}} become more self-sufficient so that they would be less reliant on a system unable to provide spiritual and survivalist needs. If one was unable to access healthy food then the logical solution was to learn how to grow one's food. Nambassa was actively promoting widespread Counterculture, Sustainable living, Holistic health and environmentalism, 30 years before Green politics was integrated into mainstream popular culture.|$|E
25|$|The Early Christian Church contested {{claims that}} pagan traditions were older {{than that of}} the Bible. Theophilus of Antioch and Augustine of Hippo both argued against Egyptian views <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> at least 100,000 years old. This figure was too high to be {{compatible}} with biblical chronology. One of La Peyrère's propositions, that China was at least 10,000 years old, gained wider currency; Martino Martini had provided details of traditional Chinese chronology, from which it was deduced by Isaac Vossius that Noah's Flood was local rather than universal.|$|E
25|$|Shamanism {{has had a}} {{historically}} important influence on the mythologies of Siberian peoples, including the Finnic, Ugric, Yeniseian, Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, and other northern Eurasia and Central Asian peoples. A central concept in their cosmologies is the myth <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> created from an egg. There are also myths about the Milky Way, ideas {{about the existence of}} the World tree or pillar, and the idea that asterisms represent animal spirits. A myth about a bird floating on the primary ocean that dives for the ground is a central Uralic cosmogonic myth.|$|E

25|$|In the Roman Empire, 25 December (in the Julian Calendar) {{date was}} celebrated {{as being the}} day when the Sun was born, the {{birthday}} of Sol Invictus, {{as can be seen in}} the Chronography of 354. This date corresponding to the date of the Winter solstice. Early Christians considered this a likely date for their saviour's nativity, as it was commonly held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> created on Spring equinox (thought to fall on 25 March at the time), and that Christ had been conceived on that date, being born 9 months later on Winter solstice.|$|E

Hecatæus is the first known writer who thought that the Caspian flows into the circumference ocean—an idea that persisted long into the Hellenic period. He was particularly informative on the Black Sea, adding many geographic places that already were known to Greeks through the colonization process. To the north of the Danube, according to Hecatæus, were the Rhipæan (gusty) Mountains, beyond which lived the Hyperboreans—peoples of the far north.|$|E
25|$|With {{his newfound}} intellect, Doc Green {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> in danger by Gamma Mutates and thus needed to be depowered. He developed a serum made from Adamantium nanobites that absorbed gamma energy. He used these to depower the Leader, the Red Hulk, and A-Bomb, but decided to 'spare' She-Hulk as he concluded that she was the one gamma mutation whose life had been legitimately improved by her mutation. At the close of the storyline, Doc Green discovered that he was beginning to disappear {{as the result of the}} Extremis serum wearing off. He ultimately allowed himself to fade away, returning to his normal Hulk form, as he feared that remaining at his current intellectual level would lead to him becoming the Maestro.|$|E

25|$|Three basic {{themes emerge}} from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a {{condition}} he called jahiliyya, the religious {{term for the}} period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslim – as he defined them – therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.|$|E
25|$|For Metzinger, {{along with}} {{to some extent}} both Gleizes and Malevich, the {{classical}} vision had been an incomplete representation of real things, based on an incomplete set of laws, postulates and theorems. It represented, quite simply, the belief that space {{is the only thing}} that separates two points. It was the belief in the geocentric reality of the observable world, unchanging and immobile. The Cubists had been delighted to discover <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> in reality dynamic, changing in time, it appeared different depending on the point of view of the observer. And yet each one of these viewpoints were equally valid, there was no preferred reference frame, all reference frames were equal. This underlying symmetry inherent in nature, in fact, is the essence of Einstein's relativity.|$|E
25|$|The Mishna and Talmud (Avodah Zara 8a) {{describe}} a pagan festival called Saturna which occurs {{for eight days}} before the winter solstice. It is followed for eight days after the solstice with a festival called Kalenda culminating with the Kalends of January. The Talmud ascribes the origins of this festival to Adam, who saw that the days were getting shorter {{and thought it was}} punishment for his sin. He was afraid <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> returning to the chaos and emptiness that existed before creation. He sat and fasted for eight days. Once he saw that the days were getting longer again he realized that this was the natural cycle of the world, so made eight days of celebration. The Talmud states that this festival was later turned into a pagan festival.|$|E

25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} a heretic once asked Rabbi Akiva {{who created the}} world. Rabbi Akiva {{answered}} that God had. The heretic demanded that Rabbi Akiva give him clear proof. Rabbi Akiva {{asked him what he}} was wearing. The heretic said that it was a garment. Rabbi Akiva asked him who made it. The heretic replied that a weaver had. Rabbi Akiva demanded that the heretic give him proof. The heretic asked Rabbi Akiva whether he did not realize that a garment is made by a weaver. Rabbi Akiva replied by asking the heretic whether he did not realize <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> made by God. When the heretic had left, Rabbi Akiva's disciples asked him to explain his proof. Rabbi Akiva replied that just as a house implies a builder, a dress implies a weaver, and a door implies a carpenter, so the world proclaims the God who created it.|$|E
25|$|Nova is {{featured}} in the Marvel Zombies edition Dead Days. Unable to overcome his fear and horror of the slaughter occurring around him, Nova fails to act {{in his own defense}} when Spider-Man attacks him. Fortunately for Nova, Daredevil intervenes but is bitten when Nova is too shocked to assist. He and Thor are rescued by the Fantastic Four and united with the other surviving heroes on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. Nova panics further when Nick Fury formulates a desperate last stand defense, citing that this was nothing like previous global threats; and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> as good as dead. Regardless, Nova helps in the battle until he is bitten by Ms. Marvel. As a zombie, he participates in a failed attack on Doctor Doom's castle, {{in an effort to get}} at the humans inside. A zombie version of Nova can be seen in the Marvel Zombies limited series, being shredded by a hail of metal fragments hurled by Magneto.|$|E
25|$|For much of history, {{the modern}} {{understanding}} of extinction {{as the end}} of a species was incompatible with the prevailing worldview. Through the 18th century, much of Western society adhered to the belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> created by God and as such was complete and perfect. This concept reached its heyday in the 1700s with the peak popularity of a theological concept called the Great Chain of Being, in which all life on earth, from the tiniest microorganism to God, is linked in a continuous chain. The extinction of a species was impossible under this model, as it would create gaps or missing links in the chain and destroy the natural order. Thomas Jefferson was a firm supporter of the Great Chain of Being and an opponent of extinction, famously denying the extinction of the wooly mammoth on the grounds that nature never allows a race of animals to become extinct.|$|E
