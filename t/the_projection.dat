5|$|Davis, Hill, and Mitchell {{find him}} {{rumbling}} {{around in the}} power plant. Davis tries to kill him, but Steiner resists his bullets, so Hill again tries to persuade Steiner {{to return to the}} laboratory. Steiner is eventually convinced, so he goes with them, but when he arrives, he tricks them and begins destroying things. With the laboratory on fire and <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> device wildly out of control, Steiner is hit by <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> device's laser, causing him to disappear as the fire rages on.|$|E

5|$|Mercator's {{editions of}} Ptolemy and his {{theological}} writings were in print {{for many years}} after {{the demise of the}} atlas but they too eventually disappeared and it was the Mercator projection which emerged as his sole and greatest legacy. His construction of a chart on which the courses of constant bearing favoured by mariners appeared as straight lines ultimately revolutionised the art of navigation, making it simpler and therefore safer. Mercator left no hints to his method of construction and it was Edward Wright who first clarified the method in his book Certaine Errors (1599)—the relevant error being the erroneous belief that straight lines on conventional charts corresponded to constant courses. Wright's solution was a numerical approximation and it was another 70 years before <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> formula was derived analytically. Wright published a new world map based on the Mercator projection, also in 1599. Slowly, but steadily, charts using <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> appeared throughout {{the first half of the}} seventeenth century and by the end of that century chart makers all over the world were using nothing but the Mercator projection, with the aim of showing the oceans and the coastlines in detail without concern for the continental interiors. At some stage <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> made the unfortunate leap to portrayal of the continents and it eventually became the canonical description of the world, despite its manifest distortions at high latitudes. Recently Mercator's projection has been rejected for representations of the world but it remains paramount for nautical charts and its use stands as his enduring legacy.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Eckert <b>{{projections}}</b> are six pseudocylindrical map projections {{devised by}} Max Eckert-Greifendorff, who presented them in 1906.

5|$|On {{election}} night, news networks {{first called}} Florida for Gore, later retracted <b>the</b> <b>projection,</b> and then called Florida for Bush, before finally retracting that projection as well. Florida's Republican Secretary of State, Katherine Harris, eventually certified Florida's vote count. This {{led to the}} Florida election recount, a move to further examine the Florida results.|$|E
5|$|Sheila is {{kidnapped by}} Steiner, who interrogates {{her in her}} {{apartment}}. She reveals that Blanchard and Latham planned against him, angering Steiner. Before leaving, Steiner sets Sheila's apartment on fire with her inside (unaware that she survives) and goes to hide at Blanchard's house. When Blanchard returns home, he is killed by Steiner. Meanwhile, Davis has examined Latham's body and realizes that the electric marks left on Latham {{were the same as}} the criminals. Steiner shows up at Hill's house, where he finds her and Mitchell. Steiner demands that they tell him where he can find more electricity, since after <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> he needs energy to survive. Hill and Mitchell try to convince him to return to the laboratory so they can try reversing <b>the</b> <b>projection,</b> but Steiner rebuffs them and leaves toward a power plant.|$|E
5|$|The known {{expansion}} {{rate of the}} Homunculus Nebula provides an unusual geometric method for measuring its distance. Assuming that the two lobes of the nebula are symmetrical, <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> of the nebula onto the sky depends on its distance. Values of 2,300, 2,250 and 2,300parsecs have been derived for the Homunculus, and Eta Carinae is clearly at the same distance.|$|E

5|$|The pinnae have {{an effect}} on facial appearance. In Western societies, {{protruding}} ears (present in about 5% of ethnic Europeans) have been considered unattractive, particularly if asymmetric.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>projection</b> dome was {{separate}} from the outer dome, and was 23 meters (75.4ft) in diameter. Made of curved aluminum sheets, it was lap jointed to create a continuous spherical surface. The sheets were painted white and perforated with 2.5-millimeter (0.1inch) holes, which were designed to let sound through and reduced echoes in the cavernous space.|$|E
5|$|The two try to {{convince}} Sheila to stop <b>the</b> <b>projection,</b> but as she is inexperienced with the device, she instead ends up projecting Steiner to somewhere else. He ends up at a construction site, the hideout of a band of thieves who are attempting to break into a bank. It is learned that an error in <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> has given Steiner the ability to kill people by touching them, and has mutilated one half of his body. Steiner kills the criminals, and then enters a store, where he steals a pair of rubber gloves and a coat. He then breaks into the institute, where he finds Latham and kills him. He also destroys the building's power supply, alerting Hill and Mitchell that something is wrong. By this time, Inspector Davis (Derek Farr) has discovered {{the bodies of the}} criminals and is determined to stop Steiner.|$|E
30|$|For maize, high {{soil water}} {{contents}} at sowing rarely {{occurred in the}} baseline, whereas in <b>the</b> <b>projections,</b> <b>the</b> number of days with soil water content >[*] 45 % increased up to 29 in DH {{as well as in}} UE. Furthermore, a clear gradation became apparent among <b>the</b> <b>projections,</b> with <b>the</b> maximum <b>projection</b> leading to <b>the</b> smallest number, and <b>the</b> minimum <b>projection</b> leading to <b>the</b> largest number of days with high soil water content. This differs from the pattern found for maturity, where <b>the</b> baseline and <b>projections</b> were generally equivalent. The abundance of the actual date and the time span around that date were similar for sowing and maturity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} reconstructing binary images from their horizontal and vertical projections.

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} the {{reconstruction}} of a measurable plane set from two projections is considered when the directions of <b>the</b> <b>projections</b> are arbitrary.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> of a disk of stars in an eccentric orbit around the central black hole. The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital apocenter, creating a concentration of stars. P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, spectral class A stars. The A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.|$|E

5|$|Panavision's first product—the Super Panatar {{projection}} lens—debuted in March 1954. Priced at $1,100, it {{captured the}} market. The Super Panatar was a rectangular box that {{attached to the}} existing projection lens with a special bracket. Its variable prismatic system allowed a range of film formats to be shown from the same projector with a simple adjustment of the lens. Panavision improved on the Super Panatar with the Ultra Panatar, a lighter design that could be screwed directly {{to the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> lens. Panavision lenses gradually replaced CinemaScope as the leading anamorphic system for theatrical projection.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} {{aspect of the}} book was Wright's method for dividing the meridian; an explanation of how he had constructed a table for the division; and the uses of this information for navigation. Essentially, the problem that occupied Wright was how to depict accurately a globe on a two-dimensional map according to <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> used by Gerardus Mercator in his map of 1569. Mercator's projection was advantageous for nautical purposes as it represented lines of constant true bearing or true course, known as loxodromes or rhumb lines, as straight lines.
