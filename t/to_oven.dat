The difference spectra indicate that the drying of as-received coal at room temperature using a Super Absorbent Polymer (SAP) removes only 44 % of moisture compared <b>to</b> <b>oven</b> drying at 105 °C. As the SAP does not completely remove {{the water from the}} coal the possibility of explosion due to oxidation of the coal powder is greatly reduced.

40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of soil water retention curve (SWRC) at the dry region {{is required to}} describe the relation between soil water content and matric suction from saturation <b>to</b> <b>oven</b> dryness. In this study, the extrapolative capability of two models for predicting the complete SWRC from limited ranges of soil water retention data was evaluated. When the model parameters were obtained from SWRC data in the 0 - 1500 kPa range, the FX model (Fredlund and Xing, 1994) estimations agreed well with measurements from saturation <b>to</b> <b>oven</b> dryness with RMSEs less than 0. 01. The GG model (Groenevelt and Grant, 2004) produced larger errors at the dry region, with significantly larger RMSEs and MEs than the FX model. Further evaluations indicated that when SWRC measurements in the 0 - 100 kPa suction range was applied for model establishment, the FX model was capable of producing acceptable SWRCs across the entire water content range. For a higher accuracy, the FX model requires soil water retention data {{at least in the}} 0 - to 300 -kPa range to extend the SWRC <b>to</b> <b>oven</b> dryness. Comparing with the Khlosi et al. (2006) model, which requires measurements in the 0 - 500 kPa range to reproduce the complete SWRCs, the FX model has the advantage of requiring less SWRC measurements. Thus the FX modeling approach has the potential to eliminate the processes for measuring soil water retention in the dry range...|$|E

30|$|Due to {{the levels}} of FA {{replacement}} and w/c ratios, the degree of cement hydration may be low (Lam et al. 2000), as may be {{the extent of the}} pozzolanic reaction (Sumranwanich and Tangtermsirikul 2004). After microcracking due <b>to</b> <b>oven</b> drying, unhydrated cement particles might become exposed and react with the saturating solution, generating new hydration products along these microcracks. Therefore, the UPV of the 40 FA cement paste increases (Fig.  7 d). It appears that rehydration is limited in samples that contain NaCl solutions and therefore is not high enough to seal the microcracks. This is in contrast to the behavior observed in the samples that are vacuum saturated with deionized water.|$|E

It seems that the wood chips of Afares oak contain more cellulose and less lignin than Zeen oak, while the Maritime pine present the highest lignin content and the lower ratio of hemicellulose. Amongst all constituents of wood samples, cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, only lignin absorbs relatively strongly in the UV/visible region. Therefore, the light induced degradation of wood is mainly caused by photochemical reactions occurring in lignin. Wood discoloration {{has been associated with}} the formation of carbonyl groups and degradation of lignin [18]; this latter contains especially guaiacoxyl: the guaiacoxyl radical is formed by degradation of the guaiacyl chromophore group [10].|$|E

In a two-step procedure, water was first condensed on the thermocouple junction for several minutes. The sample was then inserted under the wet thermocouple and the maximum psychrometric cooling was measured in about 10 seconds. Calibration was with saturated salt slurries of known water activities. Psychrometric cooling was a nearly linear function of the water activity and of the negative log of the water potential. The psychrometric cooling to water activity relationship agreed with wetbulb temperature depression to relative humidity relationships given in tables. Water activities of wheat grains and leaves decreased sharply in a curvilinear fashion as their water contents decreased. Some problems of the procedure are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This project quantifies {{moisture}} related shrinkage for plantation Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) {{growing in}} Scotland. This {{was done by}} measuring the dimensions of small clear specimens at several moisture contents from green <b>to</b> <b>oven</b> dry. It was {{found that there were}} no trends up a tree but there were several trends from pith to bark. The radial, tangential and volumetric shrinkage were greater near the pith than near the bark. The wood starts shrinking at around 35 % moisture content which would suggest that the fibre saturation point of Sitka spruce is around 35 % moisture content. The average tangential shrinkage from green moisture content <b>to</b> <b>oven</b> dry was calculated to be 7. 8 %; the average radial shrinkage was 4. 3 %; the longitudinal shrinkage was too small to measure accurately; and the average volumetric shrinkage was 12. 1 %. The average green moisture content increases from pith to bark. There appears to be no trend in the average moisture content up a tree. The data for Tree A suggests that wood near the pith distorts more than wood near the bark. The data for Tree C suggests that wood near the pith distorts less than wood near the bark. It was concluded that either the trends in distortion vary from tree to tree or that is no trend in the distortion of timber up a tree and from pith to bark. Approximately 62 % of the specimens had spring only. Approximately 5 % of the specimens had twist only. Approximately 12 % of the specimens had both spring and twist.

Joining is executed in an inert gas atmosphere e. g. argon or nitrogen or in a weak reducing atmosphere, e. g. forming gas with a maximum of 10 % hydrogen, thus eliminating the necessity of applying aggressive flux material. Steel, Cr-Ni-steel, hard metal as well as brass alloys, can be brazed flux free. The joint surfaces are activated by means of heat, which causes the oxide layer to crack and spall. It will be demonstrated that different metals require different temperatures for the breaking of the oxide layer to occur and, thus, for wetting of the braze. Inert gas brazing with local heating is currently employed in the industry. Manual and automatic brazing equipment for this procedure is commercially available...|$|E
