5|$|The Discourses are a {{collection}} of explanations and elucidations that Meher Baba has given on many topics that concern the advancement of the spiritual aspirant. Some {{of the most important}} topics treated are: sanskaras (mental impressions), Maya (the principle of illusion), the nature of <b>the</b> <b>ego,</b> reincarnation, karma, violence and non-violence, meditation, love, discipleship, and God-realization. His explanations often include stories from the lore of India and the Sufi culture. One such story, the wise man and the ghost, shows the power that superstitious beliefs can have on a person, while another, Majnun and Layla, show how selfless love, even in human relations, can lead one to discipleship.|$|E
5|$|The Third Doctor's final {{story was}} to be The Final Game by Robert Sloman and Barry Letts as an uncredited co-writer which was {{commissioned}} on 15 February 1973. The story was to end with the reveal that the Master and the Doctor were brothers or two different, opposing aspects of the same being (<b>the</b> <b>Ego</b> and the Id), and the Master dying in a manner which suggested that he sacrificed himself to save the Doctor's life. The actor who played the Master, Roger Delgado, {{was killed in a}} car accident in Turkey on 18 June 1973, forcing the scrapping of the story. The story was replaced by Planet of the Spiders.|$|E
25|$|Self-{{consciousness}} and {{the consciousness}} of the apparent universe do not end after the dissolution of <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> and several chapters of the book are dedicated to the states of consciousness gained by those who have transcended <b>the</b> <b>ego.</b> Also, most chapters of the book get into particular practices for the emancipation of consciousness from <b>the</b> <b>ego,</b> qualities that have to be developed by the individual, and examine important issues that have to be confronted in the process.|$|E
5000|$|Satan <b>Egos</b> (Satan Egosu): <b>The</b> mysterious head, entirely {{draped in}} black. He creates <b>the</b> <b>Egos</b> Monster's inside <b>the</b> <b>Egos</b> heart, calling them [...] "My beloved Children". They call him [...] "Father." [...] He is {{ultimately}} slain by the Lightning Sword Rocketter.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> pure <b>ego</b> is what James {{refers to}} as the [...] "I" [...] self. For James, <b>the</b> pure <b>ego</b> is what {{provides}} the thread of continuity between our past, present, and future selves. <b>The</b> pure <b>ego's</b> perception of consistent individual identity arises from a continual stream of consciousness. James believed that <b>the</b> pure <b>ego</b> was similar to {{what we think of as}} the soul, or the mind. <b>The</b> pure <b>ego</b> was not a substance and therefore could not be examined by science.|$|R
25|$|The little {{other is}} the other who is not really other, but a {{reflection}} and projection of <b>the</b> <b>Ego.</b> Evans adds that for this reason the symbol a can represent both objet a and <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> in the Schema L. It is simultaneously the counterpart and the specular image. The little other is thus entirely inscribed in the Imaginary order.|$|E
25|$|He also {{asserted}} {{both the}} freedom of the will and the existence of <b>the</b> <b>Ego.</b> See also Sigmund Freud, William James, Unconscious mind.|$|E
25|$|Threatened egotism is {{characterized}} {{as a response to}} criticism that threatens <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> of narcissists; they often react in a hostile and aggressive manner.|$|E

25|$|The use of <b>the</b> term <b>Ego</b> in <b>the</b> Discourses {{does not}} follow the Freudian definition, {{although}} generally {{it refers to the}} same concept and many parallels can be drawn. Baba makes no mention of the Id or the Super-ego, but only the distinction between the implicit and <b>the</b> explicit <b>ego.</b> <b>The</b> latter finds manifestation in consciousness, whereas the former remains in the subconscious mind. Isolated subconscious tendencies stored in <b>the</b> implicit <b>ego</b> must come to the explicit side {{to take part in a}} conscious process. Yet <b>the</b> explicit <b>ego</b> is very intricately organized and has self-protection mechanisms that act as a repressive barrier to subconscious tendencies. Since spiritual progress requires all subconscious tendencies to gradually pass through the conscious part of the mind and become refined and eventually eliminated, <b>the</b> explicit <b>ego</b> has to be weakened, under certain conditions, to permit this to happen.|$|R
50|$|Self-reparenting was {{developed}} by Muriel James. Unlike prior forms of reparenting, James's form of reparenting {{did not attempt to}} totally replace <b>the</b> parent <b>ego</b> state of <b>the</b> client. Instead, the therapy confirms the positive aspects already apparent in <b>the</b> client's <b>ego.</b> <b>The</b> client is also the primary agent in therapy instead of the therapist.|$|R
25|$|Freud {{compared}} {{the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> and the id to that between a charioteer and his horses: the horses provide the energy and drive, while the charioteer provides direction.|$|E
25|$|The player {{disables}} {{either the}} Id, Superego or both then invokes the Totem of Entropy. This {{ends with the}} player monitoring the computers, but <b>the</b> <b>Ego</b> kills the 750 humans on the moon.|$|E
25|$|The mirror stage {{describes}} {{the formation of}} <b>the</b> <b>Ego</b> via the process of objectification, <b>the</b> <b>Ego</b> being {{the result of a}} conflict between one's perceived visual appearance and one's emotional experience. This identification is what Lacan called alienation. At six months, the baby still lacks physical co-ordination. The child is able to recognize themselves in a mirror prior to the attainment of control over their bodily movements. The child sees their image as a whole and the synthesis of this image produces a sense of contrast with the lack of co-ordination of the body, which is perceived as a fragmented body. The child experiences this contrast initially as a rivalry with their image, because the wholeness of the image threatens the child with fragmentation—thus the mirror stage gives rise to an aggressive tension between the subject and the image. To resolve this aggressive tension, the child identifies with the image: this primary identification with the counterpart forms <b>the</b> <b>Ego.</b> Lacan understands this moment of identification as a moment of jubilation, since it leads to an imaginary sense of mastery; yet when the child compares their own precarious sense of mastery with the omnipotence of the mother, a depressive reaction may accompany the jubilation.|$|E
50|$|Aspects around sports funding, {{coupled with}} <b>the</b> <b>egos</b> of nations {{that were in}} ideological {{conflict}} with one another, meant, that sporting competitions with their participation would offer a chance to demonstrate which country was superior.|$|R
5000|$|Erikson for {{his part}} {{stressed}} that 'psychoanalysis today is...shifting its emphasis...to the study of <b>the</b> <b>ego's</b> roots in social organisation', and that its method should be 'what H. S. Sullivan called [...] "participant", and systematically so'.|$|R
5000|$|In the neo-Gnostic {{teachings of}} Samael Aun Weor, an {{individual}} has 108 chances (lifetimes) to eliminate his <b>egos</b> and transcend <b>the</b> material world before [...] "devolving" [...] and having <b>the</b> <b>egos</b> forcefully removed in the infradimensions.|$|R
25|$|Jung's {{theory of}} {{neurosis}} {{is based on}} a psyche that consists of tensions between various opposite attitudes in a self-regulating dynamic. <b>The</b> <b>ego,</b> being the center of consciousness, represents the coalescing attitude of consciousness. The ego's attitude is in tension with a complementary and balancing attitude in the unconscious.|$|E
25|$|Such loss {{results in}} severe melancholic {{symptoms}} more profound than mourning; {{not only is}} the outside world viewed negatively, but <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> itself is compromised. The patient's decline of self-perception is revealed in his belief of his own blame, inferiority, and unworthiness. He also emphasized early life experiences as a predisposing factor.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{impact of}} the six meditations has been divided. The first two meditations, which employed the skeptical methodic doubt and concluded that only <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> and its thoughts are indubitable, have had a huge impact {{in the history of}} philosophy. They are often considered as epoch-making for modernity, and an unavoidable first step for any modern philosophical thinking.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Antilibidinal <b>Ego</b> {{relating}} to <b>the</b> Bad Object, is the depressed, angry or hopeless inner child {{relating to}} the rejecting or neglectful inner parent. Whenever someone speaks in a tantrum-like way they are speaking from <b>the</b> Antilibidinal <b>Ego,</b> and they are speaking to the Bad Object. Whenever someone is overly critical and harshly judgmental they are speaking from the Bad Object part of their personality, and are speaking to <b>the</b> Antilibidinal <b>Ego</b> (hopeless inner child).|$|R
5000|$|According to Kant, the {{transcendental}} ego—the [...] "Transcendental Unity of Apperception"—is similarly unknowable. Kant contrasts <b>the</b> transcendental <b>ego</b> to <b>the</b> empirical <b>ego,</b> <b>the</b> active individual self {{subject to}} immediate introspection. One {{is aware that}} there is an [...] "I," [...] a subject or self that accompanies one's experience and consciousness. Since one experiences it as it manifests itself in time, which Kant proposes is a subjective form of perception, one can know it only indirectly: as object, rather than subject. It is <b>the</b> empirical <b>ego</b> that distinguishes one person from another providing each with a definite character.|$|R
5000|$|From another standpoint, Object {{relations}} {{theory has}} explored 'the {{encounter with the}} [...] "other" [...] that threatens <b>the</b> <b>ego's</b> integrity', as when the object in question is lacking in 'its expected function as [...] "container" [...] of excitations'.|$|R
25|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> (or cognitive) {{depletion}} {{theory of}} impulsivity, self-control {{refers to the}} capacity for altering one's own responses, especially to bring them into line with standards such as ideals, values, morals, and social expectations, and to support the pursuit of long-term goals. Self-control enables a person to restrain or override one response, thereby making a different response possible.|$|E
25|$|Issues {{considered}} in transpersonal psychology include spiritual self-development, self beyond <b>the</b> <b>ego,</b> peak experiences, mystical experiences, systemic trance, spiritual crises, spiritual evolution, religious conversion, altered states of consciousness, spiritual practices, and other sublime and/or unusually expanded experiences of living. The discipline attempts {{to describe and}} integrate spiritual experience within modern psychological theory and to formulate new theory to encompass such experience.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{when the}} id impulses (e.g., {{desire to have}} sexual {{relations}} with a stranger) conflict with the superego (e.g., belief in societal conventions of not having sex with unknown persons), unsatisfied feelings of anxiousness or feelings of anxiety come to the surface. To reduce these unpleasant feelings, <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> might use defence mechanisms (conscious or unconscious blockage of the id impulses).|$|E
2500|$|In {{appropriate}} circumstances {{the unconscious}} attitude can directly oppose <b>the</b> <b>ego's</b> attitude and produce {{all manner of}} neuroses. These situations arise when the conscious attitude {{has been unable to}} recognize and effectively integrate issues important to the attitude of the unconscious.|$|R
5000|$|Otto Fenichel {{considered}} that [...] "identification, performed {{by means of}} introjection, is the most primitive form of relationship to objects" [...] a primitive mechanism only used [...] "if <b>the</b> <b>ego's</b> function of reality testing is severely damaged by a narcissistic regression." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{system has}} both classificatory and {{descriptive}} terms. In addition to gender and generation, Iroquois kinship also distinguishes 'same-sex' and 'cross-sex' parental siblings: <b>the</b> brothers of <b>Ego's</b> (<b>the</b> subject from whose perspective the kinship is based) father, and <b>the</b> sisters of <b>Ego's</b> mother, {{are referred to}} by the same parental kinship terms used for Ego's Father and Mother. <b>The</b> sisters of <b>Ego's</b> father, and <b>the</b> brothers of <b>Ego's</b> mother, on <b>the</b> other hand, are referred to by non-parental kinship terms, commonly translated into English as [...] "Aunt" [...] and [...] "Uncle".|$|R
25|$|Freud had {{likened the}} state of melancholia to {{mourning}} in his 1917 paper Mourning and Melancholia. He theorized that objective loss, such as {{the loss of a}} valued relationship through death or a romantic break-up, results in subjective loss as well; the depressed individual has identified with the object of affection through an unconscious, narcissistic process called the libidinal cathexis of <b>the</b> <b>ego.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to Rajneesh {{every human}} being is a Buddha with the {{capacity}} for enlightenment, capable of unconditional love and of responding rather than reacting to life, although <b>the</b> <b>ego</b> usually prevents this, identifying with social conditioning and creating false needs and conflicts and an illusory sense of identity that {{is nothing but a}} barrier of dreams. Otherwise man's innate being can flower in a move from the periphery to the centre.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{aspect of}} Jung's theory of neurosis is how symptoms can vary by psychological type. The hierarchy of discriminating psychological functions gives each individual a dominant sensation, intuition, feeling, or thinking function preference with either an extroverted or introverted attitude. The dominant is quite {{under the control}} of <b>the</b> <b>ego.</b> But the inferior function remains a gateway for unconscious contents. This creates typical manifestations of inferior insight and behavior when extreme function one-sidedness accompanies the neurosis.|$|E
50|$|Where {{traditionally}} psychoanalysis had recognised {{that learning}} to speak {{was a major}} step in <b>the</b> <b>ego's</b> acquisition of power over the world, and celebrated its capacity for increasing instinctual control, Lacan by contrast stressed the more sinister side of man's early submergence in language.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 Palter co-founded, {{along with}} pianist Sam Barsh, the {{electronic}} pop group Jesse Palter and <b>the</b> Alter <b>Ego,</b> later renamed Palter <b>Ego.</b> <b>The</b> group has released 2 EPs and two albums.|$|R
50|$|Harris also {{identifies}} {{from his}} medical practice examples {{of individuals with}} blocked out Adult ego states, who were psychotic, terrified and varied between <b>the</b> Parent <b>ego</b> state's archaic admonitions about {{the world and the}} raw emotional state of the Child, making them non-treatable by therapy. For such cases, Harris endorses drug treatments, or electro-convulsive therapy, as a way to temporarily disrupt <b>the</b> disturbing <b>ego</b> states, allowing <b>the</b> “recommissioning” of <b>the</b> Adult <b>ego</b> state by therapy. Harris reports a similar approach to treating Manic Depression.|$|R
