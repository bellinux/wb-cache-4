40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} paper explores the challenges involved in introducing popular romantic fiction into the Zulu literary system, which currently {{does not include}} this type of genre. The study involves the <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracts</b> from the Mills & Boon novel, Blind Date Marriage, into isiZulu under the title of UNtombi nethambo lakhe leKentucky. In her role as the translator, the author discusses the important cultural (and other) factors {{that need to be}} taken into account in the <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> popular romantic fiction into isiZulu. This is done through a descriptive analysis of the cultural context adaptation strategies adopted by the translator in the process of producing the target text and of the extent to which the target culture/system and its linguistic norms necessitate the re-contextualisation of the source text for the new audience...|$|R

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of 69 phage-specific polypeptides during the infection of Bacillus subtilis with bacteriophage SP 82 {{was detected by}} pulse-labeling, one-dimensional electrophoresis, and autoradiography. SP 82 virions were found to contain approximately 22 polypeptides, {{most of which were}} synthesized late in infection; evidence was obtained for the processing of the major virion protein. RNAs extracted at different times during infection were translated by using an Escherichia coli cell-free extract. Only smaller-molecular-weight peptides were produced efficiently in vitro; in the 9, 000 - to 60, 000 -molecular-weight range, 50 to 60 % of the peptides synthesized in vivo were produced by <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> RNAs <b>extracted</b> from infected cells. Eight of the virion peptides were produced by in vitro <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> RNAs <b>extracted</b> from infected cells. RNAs were synthesized under defined conditions by RNA polymerase extracted from uninfected B. subtilis and by polymerases isolated from cells 8 and 20 min after infection with SP 82. <b>Translation</b> <b>of</b> these RNAs yielded characteristic and different patterns of polypeptides. Nine of the 12 polypeptides produced by <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> RNAs synthesized by the host polymerase corresponded in mobility to peptides appearing in vivo in the 0 to 3 and 3 to 6 min intervals of pulse-labeling after infection; 12 of the 25 peptides synthesized from RNAs produced by polymerase extracted 8 min after infection corresponded in mobility to peptides detected in vivo 8 min after infection, and 15 of the 22 peptides directed by RNAs made by the polymerase isolated 20 min after infection corresponded to peptides present in vivo late in infection.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> a {{political}} and historical text on the French-African relations from French into Swedish, focusing on the <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> cultural reference and metaphor. The African context is relatively unknown to Swedish readers. This and other factors mean that some expressions and phenomena mentioned in the source text will need explanation in the translated text. This type of text also contains a large number of metaphors that may have to be adapted to the target text context. The analysis in this paper has been made using the author’s own <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> an <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> the essay book ”La France en Afrique – Cinq siècles de présence: vérités et mensonges” by Jean-Paul Gourévitch. A number of works dedicated to the <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> metaphors and cultural reference have been studied and theories applied to the <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> this particular source text. The main results of the study are firstly that Ogden & Richards triangle of reference will be particularly helpful to the translator when dealing with the issues of cultural reference and metaphor.

40|$|Ribonucleic {{acid and}} protein {{synthesis}} in developing wheat kernels {{have been studied}} through in vivo labeling of wheat heads in culture. In INIA 66 R wheat labeled with [5 - 3 H]uridine for 24 -hour periods between 9 and 33 days after flowering, the total rate of RNA accumulation in endosperm/testa pericarp tissues was highest in the youngest seeds, and declined with increasing seed age. In contrast, the rate of accumulation of poly(A) + RNA approximately doubled between 12 and 15 days after flowering, reached a maximum between 15 and 18 days, and declined to half the maximum rate by 24 days. Protein synthetic capacity, measured by in vitro <b>translation</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracted</b> seed RNA, increased in a developmental pattern {{similar to that of}} poly(A) + RNA accumulation, but remained near maximal through 24 days after flowering. Gliadins were prominent in the in vitro translation products. When seed protein was labeled in vivo with l-[3 H]leucine, extracted, and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a significant change in the protein synthesis profile was apparent between 12 and 15 days after flowering, and was coincident with a marked increase in storage protein synthesis. Qualitatively similar characteristics were exhibited by the cultivar Cheyenne, although in a shorter developmental period. These results are consistent with a direct relation between levels of mRNA and rates of protein synthesis in developing wheat seeds, with a relatively long storage protein mRNA lifetime, and with control of storage protein gene expression primarily at the level of mRNA transcription...|$|R
