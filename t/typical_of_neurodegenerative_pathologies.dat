Recently longitudinal studies started {{to show how the}} temporal component is important to investigate temporal diffuse effects <b>of</b> <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>pathologies.</b> Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) constitutes one of the most sensitive techniques for the detection and characterization of brain related pathological processes and allows also the reconstruction of WM fibers. The analysis of spatial and temporal pathological changes along the fibers are thus possible by merging quantitative maps with structural information provided by DTI. In this work, we present a new genetic algorithm (GA) based method to analyze longitudinal changes occurring along WM fiber-bundles. In {{the first part of this}} paper, we describe the data processing pipeline, including data registration and fiber tract post-processing. In the second part, we focus our attention to the description of our GA model. In the last part, we show the tests we performed on simulated and real MS longitudinal data.

Intraneuronal protein accumulation may regulate microglial activity via the fractalkine (CX 3 CL 1) signaling pathway that provides a mechanism through which neurons communicate with microglia. CX 3 CL 1 levels fluctuate in different stages <b>of</b> <b>neurodegenerative</b> diseases and in various animal models, warranting further investigation of the mechanisms underlying microglial response to pathogenic proteins, including Tau, β-amyloid (Aβ), and α-synuclein. The temporal relationship between microglial activity and localization of pathogenic proteins (intra- versus extracellular) likely determines whether neuroinflammation mitigates or exacerbates disease progression. Evidence in transgenic models suggests a beneficial effect of microglial activity on clearance of proteins like Aβ and a detrimental effect on Tau modification, but the role of CX 3 CL 1 signaling in α-synucleinopathies is less clear.

Recently, it has been found using cell culture models that transient increases of intracellular Ca 2 + induce cytoplasmic α-syn aggregates. Ca 2 +-dependent α-syn aggregation could be blocked by the Ca 2 + buffering agent, BAPTA-AM, or by the Ca 2 + channel blocker, Trimethadione. Furthermore, a greater proportion of cells positive for aggregates occurred when both raised Ca 2 + and oxidative stress were combined, indicating that Ca 2 + and oxidative stress cooperatively promote α-syn aggregation.

Previous studies have suggested a number of theories to explain the etiology of BD, including the influence of genetic factors, deficits in neurodevelopmental processes, implication <b>of</b> <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>pathologies,</b> changes in monoamine neurotransmission, and abnormalities in neuroplasticity (van Enkhuizen et al. 2015; Goes 2016; Passos et al. 2016).

In this review, the authors summarize the current understanding of this subtle signaling pathway, discuss the evidence for nitrergic modulation of ion channels and homeostatic modulation of intrinsic excitability, and speculate about the pathological consequences of spillover between different nitrergic compartments in contributing to aberrant signaling in neurodegenerative disorders. Accumulating evidence points to various ion channels and particularly voltage-gated potassium channels as signaling targets, whereby NO mediates activity-dependent control of intrinsic neuronal excitability; such changes could underlie broader mechanisms of synaptic plasticity across neuronal networks. In addition, the inability to constrain NO diffusion suggests that spillover from endothelium (eNOS) and/or immune compartments (iNOS) into the nervous system provides potential pathological sources of NO and where control failure in these other systems could have broader neurological implications.

Albumin structure and functions are impaired following metal- and glucose-mediated oxidative alterations. The aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate effects of Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions on glucose-induced modifications in albumin by focusing on glycation, aggregation, oxidation and functional aspects. Methods: Aggregation and conformational changes in albumin were monitored by spectroscopy, fluorescence and microscopy techniques. Biochemical assays such as carbonyl, thiol groups, albumin-bound Cu, fructosamine and amine group measurements were used. Cellular assays were used to gain functional information concerning antioxidant activity of oxidized albumins. Results: Both metals promoted inhibition of albumin glycation associated with an enhanced aggregation and oxidation process. Metal ions gave rise to the formation of β-amyloid type aggregates in albumin exhibiting impaired antioxidant properties and toxic activity to murine microglia cells (BV 2). The differential efficiency of both metal ions to inhibit albumin glycation, to promote aggregation and to affect cellular physiology is compared.

40|$|Atrophy is {{regarded}} a sensitive marker <b>of</b> <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>pathology.</b> In addition to confirming the well-known presence of decreased global grey matter and hippocampal volumes in Alzheimer’s disease, {{this study investigated}} whether deep grey matter structure also suffer degeneration in Alzheimer’s disease, and whether such degeneration is associated with cognitive deterioration. In this cross-sectional correlation study, two groups were compared on volumes of seven subcortical regions: 70 memory complainers (MCs) and 69 subjects diagnosedwith probable Alzheimer’s disease. Using 3 T 3 DT 1 MR images, volumes of nucleus accumbens, amyg-dala, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen and thalamus were automatically calculated by the FMRIB’s Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST) çalgorithm FMRIB’s Software Library (FSL). Subsequently, the volumes of the different regions were correlated with cognitive test results. In addition to finding the expected association between hippocampal atrophy and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, volumes of putamen and thalamus were significantly reduced in patients diagnosed with probable Alzheimer’s disease. We {{also found that the}} decrease in volume correlated linearly with impaired global cognitive perfor-mance. These findings strongly suggest that, beside neo-cortical atrophy, deep grey matter structures in Alzheimer’s disease suffer atrophy as well and that degenerative processes in the putamen and thalamus...|$|R
40|$|Analysis and {{quantification}} {{of brain}} structural changes, using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are increasingly {{used to define}} novel biomarkers of brain pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Network-based models of the brain have shown that both local and global topological properties can reveal patterns of disease propagation. On the other hand, intra-subject descriptions cannot exploit the whole information context, accessible through inter-subject comparisons. To address this, we developed a novel approach, which models brain structural connectivity atrophy with a multiplex network and summarizes it within a classification score. On an independent dataset multiplex networks were able to correctly segregate, from normal controls (NC), AD patients and subjects with mild cognitive impairment that will convert to AD (cMCI) with an accuracy of, respectively, 0. 86 ± 0. 01 and 0. 84 ± 0. 01. The model also shows that illness effects are maximally detected by parceling the brain in equal volumes of 3000 mm^ 3 ("patches"), without any a priori segmentation based on anatomical features. A direct comparison to standard voxel-based morphometry on the same dataset showed that the multiplex network approach had higher sensitivity. This method is general and can have twofold potential applications: providing a reliable tool for clinical trials and a disease signature <b>of</b> <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>pathologies.</b> Comment: 16 pages, 8 figures, 2 table...|$|R
