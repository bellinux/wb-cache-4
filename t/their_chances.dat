5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize <b>their</b> <b>chances</b> of a catch.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{to other}} {{shooters}} where melee {{is usually a}} last resort, F.E.A.R.'s melee is a viable instant-kill alternative for taking down enemies. The stocks of all firearms {{can be used in}} close combat. Lighter weapons, while being less powerful, allow the player to move around more quickly, increasing <b>their</b> <b>chances</b> of melee. Movement speed is maximized if a player holsters their weapon, which also allows them to engage in hand-to-hand attacks with maneuvers including punches, kicks, and slides.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, Capetian Kings of France {{chose to}} have their heirs {{apparent}} crowned during their own lifetime {{in order to avoid}} succession disputes. This practice was later adopted by Angevin Kings of England, Kings of Hungary and other European monarchs. From the moment of their coronation, the heirs were regarded as junior kings (rex iunior), but they exercised little power and historically {{were not included in the}} numbering of monarchs if they predeceased their fathers. The nobility disliked this custom, as it reduced <b>their</b> <b>chances</b> to benefit from a possible succession dispute.|$|E

The U.S. also lost their next match 5–2, versus Chile, ending their 1950 World Cup run with a First Round record of 1–0–2. They would not qualify for the World Cup again until 1990. Spain advanced to the four-team Final Round, finishing fourth. Uruguay won the 1950 World Cup.|$|E

Food items include small aquatic crustaceans (cladocerans, copepods and ostracods), aquatic dipterans and tadpoles. As they develop, they naturally feed upon larger prey. To increase <b>their</b> <b>chances</b> for survival, some individuals grow bigger heads and become cannibals, and feed upon their own brood mates.|$|E
5|$|On August 2, 2006, quarterback Rhett Bomar and {{offensive}} lineman J.D. Quinn, both sophomores, were dismissed from the team. It {{was reported that}} they violated NCAA regulations regarding receiving extra compensation. It was later determined Bomar received $7,406.88 and Quinn $8,137.17. The loss of these two key players affected the team's placement in many publications' preseason polls as well as <b>their</b> <b>chances</b> of winning a national championship. The team turned to starting quarterback Paul Thompson (a converted wide receiver in 2005) and backup Joey Halzle to lead the team.|$|E

With their state-level defeat there, some talked of dropping English from the ticket, but he convinced them that the October losses owed more to local issues, and that the Democratic ticket could still carry Indiana, if not Ohio, in November.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{start to}} their league campaign, with one defeat {{in their first}} 12 matches saw Arsenal begin November in first spot. Although the club were winless during the Christmas period, <b>their</b> <b>chances</b> of winning the title {{remained}} intact. A run of two draws and losses in February was more severe, as it moved Arsenal down to fourth spot. Draws in April prompted Wenger to rule his team out of the title race and make priority to second spot, which came with a qualifying spot for the Champions League. Defeat to Newcastle United in the penultimate {{game of the season}} all but ended Arsenal's chances of finishing second, given Newcastle's superior goal difference. A win on the final day against Derby County meant the club finished third, level on points with Newcastle and Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 50percent of midshipmen {{were the}} sons of {{professional}} men, which included {{the sons of}} naval officers, and there were notable sailing families throughout the Age of Sail, such as the Saumarez, Hood, and Parker families. The niceties of preferment and promotion made family connections an obvious advantage for prospective officers. Members of the peerage and landed gentry formed the next largest group, about 27percent of officers. The numbers were smaller, but similarly, their connections gave them excellent prospects for promotion, {{and they had a}} considerable influence on the Royal Navy. A notable member of this group was Prince William, later William IV, who served as a midshipman from 1780–1785.
