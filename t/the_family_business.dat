This research identified and evaluated the critical events and processes that have led to several <b>family</b> <b>business</b> successions in <b>the</b> Molson <b>family</b> <b>business.</b> <b>The</b> research design involved qualitative methodology. A single in-depth longitudinal case study created a narrative of <b>the</b> Molson <b>family</b> <b>business,</b> from <b>the</b> founder to the current sixth generation leader. The findings revealed that by ensuring grooming of the offspring, a mutual role adjustment between the older and younger generations, and selection of next-generation leader based on abilities and competencies, <b>the</b> Molson <b>family</b> <b>business</b> survived for over 220 years. Effective succession planning in this <b>family</b> <b>business</b> also involved minimizing conflicts and being able to separate <b>the</b> <b>family</b> and <b>business</b> system...|$|R
