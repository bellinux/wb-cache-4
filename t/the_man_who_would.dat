5|$|It {{is unclear}} who, if anyone, {{was in charge}} of the ship at this point, as Luke Collingwood had been gravely ill for some time. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> {{normally}} have replaced him, first mate James Kelsall, had been previously suspended from duty following an argument on 14November. Robert Stubbs had captained a slave ship several decades earlier and he temporarily commanded Zong during Collingwood's incapacitation, but he was not a registered member of the vessel's crew. According to historian James Walvin, the breakdown of the command structure on the ship might explain the subsequent navigational errors and the absence of checks on supplies of drinking water.|$|E
5|$|Following For Your Eyes Only, Roger Moore had {{expressed}} a desire to retire from the role of James Bond. His original contract had been for three films, which was fulfilled with The Spy Who Loved Me. Subsequent films were negotiated on a film-by-film basis. Given his reluctance to return for Octopussy, the producers engaged in a semi-public quest for the next Bond, with both Timothy Dalton and James Brolin being suggested. However, when the rival Never Say Never Again was announced, the producers re-contracted Moore in the belief that an established actor in the role would fare better against Sean Connery. Brolin's three screentests were publicly released {{for the first time as}} a special feature named James Brolin: <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Would</b> Be Bond in the Octopussy Ultimate Edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|Ray {{gathered}} an inexperienced crew, {{although both}} his cameraman Subrata Mitra and art director Bansi Chandragupta {{went on to}} achieve great acclaim. The cast consisted of mostly amateur actors. He started shooting in late 1952 with his personal savings and hoped to raise more money once he had some passages shot, but did not succeed on his terms. As a result, Ray shot Pather Panchali over three years, an unusually long period, based on when he or his production manager Anil Chowdhury could raise additional funds. He refused funding from sources who wanted a change in script or supervision over production. He also ignored advice from the government to incorporate a happy ending, but he did receive funding {{that allowed him to}} complete the film. Ray showed an early film passage to the American director John Huston, who was in India scouting locations for <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Would</b> Be King. The passage was of the vision which Apu and his sister have of the train running through the countryside, the only sequence which Ray had yet filmed due to his small budget. Huston notified Monroe Wheeler at the New York Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) that a major talent was on the horizon.|$|E

5|$|The figure {{arrives at}} Valestra's house but finds the gangster dead by Joker's hands. Joker has {{strapped}} a camera to Valestra's corpse {{and sees the}} murderer is not Batman. The figure escapes as the house explodes. Batman pursues the killer, but is interrupted {{by the police and}} rescued from arrest by Andrea. Andrea later explains that she and her father had been hiding in Europe from Valestra's mob, from whom he had embezzled money; her father repaid, but they put out a hit on him. Bruce now believes her father is the killer. Bruce ponders resuming his relationship with Andrea and giving up Batman. He notices a familiar-looking man in the background of the photo of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont: <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> become the Joker. Joker visits Reeves and presses him for information; Reeves insists that Batman is the cloaked killer. He professes his ignorance but Joker believes Reeves needs to protect his reputation and poisons him. Reeves is taken to the hospital where Batman later breaks in and interrogates him. Reeves confesses he helped the Beaumonts escape and told Valestra's mob their location.|$|E

25|$|While {{it is true}} {{that very}} little detail of Hephaestion’s {{childhood}} and education can be found, that which remains gives credence to what is known about his later life. His friendship with Alexander was long-lasting, as was his tenure in the court at Pella; he even shared the same education as the future Great King of Greece and Asia. With such a promising start, age and experience would have helped mould Hephaestion Amyntoros into <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> one day be the second most powerful man in Alexander’s empire, second only to the king himself.|$|E

Then Judge Choate introduced <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> assume the headmastership in the fall, George St. John, and his wife, Clara Seymour St. John. She was a Bryn Mawr alumna, member of a well-connected Connecticut family, sister of future (1937–1951) Yale president Charles Seymour, and descendant of Yale president (1740–1766) Thomas Clap.|$|E
25|$|After {{the murder}} of Pertinax (28 March 193), the Praetorian assassins {{announced}} that the throne was {{to be sold to}} <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> pay the highest price.

25|$|Several {{scientific}} clubs, {{such as the}} Philosophical Club and the Red Lion Club, {{were formed}} in the late 19th century, but these organisations lacked the scientific professionalism that serious scientists, including those members of the X Club such as Hooker and Huxley, sought.

25|$|Halleck {{established}} an uncomfortable relationship with <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> become his most successful subordinate and future commander, Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. The pugnacious Grant {{had just completed}} the minor, but bloody, Battle of Belmont and had ambitious plans for amphibious operations on the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. Halleck, by nature a cautious general, but also judging that Grant's reputation for alcoholism in the prewar period made him unreliable, rejected Grant's plans. However, under pressure from President Lincoln to take offensive action, Halleck reconsidered and Grant conducted operations with naval and land forces against Forts Henry and Donelson in February 1862, capturing both, along with 14,000 Confederates.|$|E
