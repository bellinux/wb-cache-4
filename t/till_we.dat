25|$|Red {{worked on}} new {{material}} for Until We Have Faces during their 2009–2010 tours. They travelled with a portable case that unfolds into a mini recording studio, {{allowing them to}} put down ideas {{in the green room}} at venues. In a departure from their usual songwriting methods, much of the demo material stemmed from Rauch's rhythms he developed for song ideas on his home kit, leaving {{the rest of the group}} to develop their parts from them. Barnes said the band wanted to direct the album towards the idea of someone finding their own identity, and drew inspirations from various sources, including the novel <b>Till</b> <b>We</b> Have Faces by C.S. Lewis.|$|E

The virtuous declaimer will neither persuade himself nor any other person to be content with a double mess of porridge, instead of a reasonable stipend for his services. We might as soon reconcile ourselves to the Spartan community of goods and wives, to their iron coin, their long beards, or their black broth. There is a total dissimulation in the circumstances, as well as the manners, of society among us; and it is as ridiculous to seek for models in the simple ages of Greece and Rome, as it would be to go in quest of them among the Hottentots and Laplanders.|$|E

[...] As First Lord St Vincent intended to investigate, discover and remove all of the corruption that he considered plagued the Navy, the Royal Dockyards and their civilian administration. Consequently, he clashed with the various Navy Boards, the civil administration of the Royal Navy that administered among other things the navy yards and stores.

The sixth of eight {{children}} in a poor family, she began playing piano {{at the age of}} three; the first song she learned was [...] "God Be With You, <b>Till</b> <b>We</b> Meet Again". Demonstrating a talent with the instrument, she performed at her local church. But her concert debut, a classical recital, was given when she was 12. Simone later said that during this performance, her parents, who had taken seats in the front row, were forced to move {{to the back of the}} hall to make way for white people. She said that she refused to play until her parents were moved back to the front, and that the incident contributed to her later involvement in the civil rights movement.|$|E

Written in the key of D major, the song is set in common time with a fast-paced tempo of 126 beats per minute. The song follows a basic sequence of D–G–D–G–D–A as its chord progression. The chorus of the song is predominantly featured alongside the bridge, is backed by wordless chants, and encompasses the lines: [...] "Let’s go crazy, crazy, crazy <b>till</b> <b>we</b> see the sun/ I know we only met but let’s pretend it’s love / And never, never, never stop for anyone/ Tonight let’s get some, and live while we’re young."

Every time it came on, I just wanted to scream, claw my face. I was taking German in high school—which meant that we listened to it in school. I couldn't get away from it." [...] According to Broderick, Ferris's singing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] in the shower was his idea. [...] "Although it's only because of the brilliance of John's deciding that I should sing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] on the float in the parade. I had never heard the song before. I was learning it for the parade scene. So we're doing the shower scene and I thought, 'Well, I can do a little rehearsal.' And I did something with my hair to make that Mohawk.

500|$|On 17 March 2014, the FA {{membership}} committee advised {{that the name}} change application be rejected at the FA Council meeting on 9 April. In response, the club published a statement saying the FA was [...] "prejudiced" [...] and criticised the committee's consultation with the City <b>Till</b> <b>We</b> Die opposition group. The following week, the club opened a ballot of season ticket holders over the name change. Opponents of the name change criticised as [...] "loaded" [...] the questions, which asked respondents to choose between [...] "Yes to Hull Tigers with the Allam family continuing to lead the club", [...] "No to Hull Tigers" [...] and [...] "I am not too concerned {{and will continue to}} support the club either way", on the grounds that voters were not given the option to reject the name while keeping the Allam family as owners. Of 15,033 season ticket holders, 5,874 voted in all, with 2,565 voting in favour of the change and 2,517 against, while 792 chose the [...] "not too concerned" [...] option.|$|E
500|$|The pike {{and shot}} {{infantry}} had {{by this time}} adopted {{a system in which}} arquebusiers and pikemen were intermingled in combined units; both the French and the Imperial infantry contained men with firearms interspersed in the larger columns of pikemen. This combination of pikes and small arms made close-quarters fighting extremely bloody. The mixed infantry was normally placed in separate clusters, with the arquebusiers on the flanks of a central column of pikemen; at Ceresole, however, the French infantry had been arranged with the first rank of pikemen followed immediately by a rank of arquebusiers, who were ordered to hold their fire until the two columns met. Montluc, who claimed to have devised the scheme, wrote that: In this way we should kill all their captains in the front rank. [...] But we found that they were as ingenious as ourselves, for behind their first line of pikes they had put pistoleers. Neither side fired <b>till</b> <b>we</b> were touching—and then there was a wholesale slaughter: every shot told: the whole front rank on each side went down. The Swiss, seeing the French engage one of the two columns of landsknechte, finally descended to meet the other, which had been slowly moving up the hillside. Both masses of infantry remained locked in a push of pike until the squadron of heavy cavalry under Boutières charged into the landsknechts' flank, shattering their formation and driving them down the slope. The Imperial heavy cavalry, which had been on the landsknechts' right, and which had been ordered by d'Avalos to attack the Swiss, recoiled from the pikes and fled to the rear, leaving Carlo Gonzaga to be taken prisoner.|$|E

In an attempt to make till micromorphology studies less subjective and investigate the orientation of sand-sized particles in <b>tills,</b> <b>we</b> have developed an image analysis procedure to measure and analyse the spatial distribution of the <b>till</b> microfabric. <b>We</b> studied 13 thin sections of the Weichselian subglacial till and basal shear zone outcropping in the Baltic Sea bluffs at the Ziemupe site in western Latvia.

We found that in larger areas microfabric, although much weaker than macrofabric, coincides with macrofabric orientation. In the sub-centimetre scale till microfabric in short distances appears to be highly variable both in strength and preferred orientation, and a domain-like pattern appears...|$|R
