5|$|Lem's works explore {{philosophical}} themes through {{speculation on}} technology, {{the nature of}} intelligence, <b>the</b> <b>impossibility</b> of communication with and understanding of alien intelligence, despair about human limitations, and humanity's place in the universe. They are sometimes presented as fiction, but others are {{in the form of}} essays or philosophical books.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scholars}} {{argue that}} there is no one High Priest who is the strongest candidate for identification with each of the Wicked Priest passages. The different demises of the Wicked Priest and the tenses associated with them are often cited as evidence of <b>the</b> <b>impossibility</b> of a single Wicked Priest.|$|E
5|$|Five years later, Harry and Sally find {{themselves}} on the same flight. Sally is dating Harry's neighbor Joe, and Harry is engaged, which surprises Sally.

5|$|Fürst Bismarck was {{designed}} before the naval arms race between Germany and the United Kingdom. Admiral Hollmann was the State Secretary of the Naval Office at the time. Given {{the dominance of}} the British Royal Navy and <b>the</b> <b>impossibility,</b> as he saw it, of competing with it, Hollmann envisaged a small fleet consisting of torpedo boats and coastal defense ships to be based in German waters. This would be supplemented by a number of cruisers for overseas duties, including trade protection.|$|E
5|$|Tessa is MacLeod's mortal {{companion}} and bears {{the consequences of}} his immortality. These include her aging while he does not, <b>the</b> <b>impossibility</b> of having children together and the dangers of MacLeod's involvement in the Game, an ongoing battle in which all Immortals must behead each other until a single victor remains. Fully aware of this situation, Tessa stays with MacLeod, demonstrating her courage, understanding, generosity and compassion.|$|E
5|$|A bill {{setting out}} {{arrangements}} for funding and building the fleet was finalized in mid-July 1914. At {{this time the}} Navy had not yet settled on a final battleship design. It was planned that the first ship's keel would be laid in December 1914 and fitting out be completed sometime in 1918. The bill was not immediately introduced into parliament, however, as Idenburg was given until 10 August to comment on it. The outbreak of the First World War led to the bill being withdrawn due to the uncertain international circumstances and <b>the</b> <b>impossibility</b> of buying battleships from foreign shipbuilders in wartime. Instead, the Government ordered three s in 1915, though only two were completed.|$|E

5|$|As Ukrainian {{psychiatrist}} Ada Korotenko notes, {{the use of}} punitive psychiatry allowed {{of avoiding}} the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare <b>the</b> <b>impossibility</b> to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can {{be based on a}} preconception. Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments. The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being set}} in space, the film uses motifs from {{shipwreck}} and wilderness survival stories about psychological change and resilience {{in the aftermath}} of a catastrophe. Cuarón uses the character, Stone, to illustrate clarity of mind, persistence, training, and improvisation in the face of isolation and the consequences of a relentless Murphy's law. The film incorporates spiritual or existential themes, in the facts of Stone's daughter's accidental and meaningless death, and in the necessity of summoning the will to survive in the face of overwhelming odds, without future certainties, and with <b>the</b> <b>impossibility</b> of rescue from personal dissolution without finding this willpower. Calamities occur but only the surviving astronauts see them.|$|E
5|$|Gertrude summons Hamlet to {{her room}} to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about <b>the</b> <b>impossibility</b> of repenting, since he still has {{possession}} of his ill-gotten goods: his brother's crown and wife. He sinks to his knees. Hamlet, {{on his way to}} visit his mother, sneaks up behind him, but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while his father's ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a tapestry, makes a noise.|$|E

5|$|Insects have {{appeared}} in mythology around the world from ancient times. Among the insect groups featuring in myths are the bee, butterfly, cicada, dragonfly, praying mantis and scarab beetle. Scarab beetles held religious and cultural symbolism in Old Egypt, Greece and some shamanistic Old World cultures. The ancient Chinese regarded cicadas as symbols of rebirth or immortality. In Mesopotamian literature, the epic poem of Gilgamesh has allusions to dragonflies, signifying <b>the</b> <b>impossibility</b> of immortality. Amongst the Arrernte Aborigines of Australia, honey ants and witchety grubs served as personal clan totems. In {{the case of the}} San bushmen of the Kalahari, it is the praying mantis which holds much cultural significance including creation and zen-like patience in waiting.|$|E
5|$|One of Lem's major {{recurring}} themes, beginning {{from his}} very first novel, The Man from Mars, was <b>the</b> <b>impossibility</b> of communication between profoundly alien beings, which may have no common ground with human intelligence, and humans. The best known example is the living planetary ocean in Lem's novel Solaris. Other examples include swarms of mechanical insects (in The Invincible), and strangely ordered societies of more human-like beings in Fiasco and Eden, describing {{the failure of the}} first contact. In His Master's Voice, Lem describes the failure of humanity's intelligence to decipher and truly comprehend an apparent message from space.|$|E
5|$|Quantitative {{methods are}} often used to ask {{questions}} about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, <b>the</b> <b>impossibility</b> of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese general, {{convinced}} of <b>the</b> <b>impossibility</b> of taking Badajoz by assault, changed his strategy {{and began a}} circumvallation of the town, {{in order to try}} to isolate it completely. The Spanish, meanwhile, were reinforcing their own defensive fortifications with extensive works, mainly ravelins built between the medieval towers. Various outlying forts were also strengthened with the aim of obstructing the Portuguese works and forcing them to build a larger circumvallation line. One of these forts was San Miguel, a star fort able to accommodate 600 infantry, built around a hermitage. It had five earthen bulwarks and an artillery-proof parapet.|$|E
5|$|The discography of American {{heavy metal}} band Chimaira {{consists}} of seven studio albums, two extended plays, eleven singles, two video albums and eleven music videos. Chimaira originated in Cleveland, Ohio, composed of vocalist Mark Hunter, guitarists Jason Hager and Rob Arnold, bassist Jim LaMarca, drummer Andols Herrick and programmer Chris Spicuzza. Hager {{would later be}} replaced by Matt DeVries in 2001. Chimaira's first release was an extended play, This Present Darkness, which sold 10,000 copies. After signing to Roadrunner Records, the band's debut studio album, Pass Out of Existence, was released in August 2001. A second studio album, <b>The</b> <b>Impossibility</b> of Reason, followed in 2003, debuting and peaking at number 117 on the Billboard 200. Herrick was replaced by drummer Kevin Talley, formerly of Misery Index, in 2004. A video album, The Dehumanizing Process, arrived later that year, documenting the writing and recording process behind <b>The</b> <b>Impossibility</b> of Reason. Chimaira released a self-titled album in August 2005, which peaked at number 74 on the Billboard 200. After an internal crisis due to pressure from the label by a new release, the band moved on from Roadrunner and signed a new deal with Ferret Music. In early 2006, Herrick rejoined the band and Chimaira recorded their fourth studio album Resurrection, which appeared in early March 2007. Resurrection peaked at number 42 on the Billboard 200.|$|E

5|$|While a great {{solution}} for the actors' performances the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white tube to match the sky over the Bolivian desert, and <b>the</b> <b>impossibility</b> of filming medium to wide shots of the actors. An array of eight Dalsa Origin cameras (supported by seven HD cameras and a 35mm hand-held camera, all running in sync) was {{used to create a}} virtual camera with which to shoot the actors floating in the simulator. Ged Wright and his team at Double Negative developed a method to use the data from these cameras that allowed these real performances to be placed in a synthetic environment as seen by a synthetic camera.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{a dispute}} between the FVdG and the Free Trade Unions in Berlin led the party {{commission}} to intervene and to sponsor talks aimed at re-unification of the two wings of the German labor movement. At the meeting, the FVdG {{made a number of}} compromises, which led to member protests. Soon, over one-third of the members left the union. The 1903 FVdG congress elected a panel to continue negotiations with the Free Trade Unions. This panel demanded that the Free Trade Unions adopt localist organizational principles as a prerequisite for re-unification. The FVdG panel realized this demand was unrealistic, but hoped the expulsion of revisionists from the SPD during the debate on Eduard Bernstein's theses would strengthen their position. <b>The</b> <b>impossibility</b> of a reconciliation between the two became obvious by March 1904, since the re-unification envisioned by both the leadership of the SPD and the Free Trade Unions was more along the lines of an integration of the FVdG into the Free Trade Unions.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty was {{weighted}} in Alexios' {{favor and}} {{provided for the}} eventual absorption of Antioch and its territory into the Empire. Alexios, recognizing <b>the</b> <b>impossibility</b> of driving Bohemond out of Antioch, tried to absorb him into the structure of Byzantine rule, and put him work for the Empire's benefit. Bohemond was to retain Antioch until his death with the title of doux, unless the emperor (either Alexios or, in the future, John) chose for any reason to renege on the deal. The principality would revert to direct Byzantine rule on Bohemond's death. Bohemond therefore could not set up a dynasty in Antioch, although he was guaranteed the right {{to pass on to}} his heirs the County of Edessa, and any other territories he managed to acquire in the Syrian interior.|$|E
