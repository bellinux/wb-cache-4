5|$|Unfortunately, {{having been}} {{preoccupied with the}} nerd situation, Homer is not {{prepared}} for his final exam. The nerds say {{the only way to}} pass is <b>to</b> <b>cram</b> for the final exam, which they help him do. However, despite Homer's best attempts, he gets an F. To Homer's delight, the nerds hack into the school's student records and change his grade to an A+, but unfortunately, Marge finds out and forces Homer to take the course again in order to set a good example for Bart and Lisa. Homer's next college experience is shown during the end credits, with college clichés such as hazing by a fraternity, phonebooth stuffing, a food fight, and finally his graduation ceremony where Homer flashes the audience.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, {{three years}} after {{homosexuality}} was decriminalised in Ireland, male characters Eoghan and Liam moved in for a clinch – only to be interrupted. It {{would have been the}} first gay kiss on Irish television. Nowadays Fair City deals with LGBT themes more openly and more regularly. Yvonne, one of the soap's main characters, is bisexual, and used to date Connie from Australia. They were to have been married in Northern Ireland. Laura, lesbian daughter of Tess Halpin, formed a relationship with social worker Emily, only to have it broken up by the jealous, bitter and deranged Lucy. Troy, the son of Leo Dowling (another major character), is openly gay. Also, in 1996, teacher Barry O'Hanlon and student Niamh Cassidy had an illicit relationship. In 1997, Lorraine Molly became addicted to amphetamines <b>to</b> <b>cram</b> for her exams.|$|E
25|$|Coe {{had planned}} to have a {{somewhat}} quiet season in 1985, {{partly because of the}} intensity of the previous year's efforts to get himself ready in time for the Olympics, as well as a planned move up to 5000m, which never materialised. He suffered a recurrence of a back problem which had plagued him on and off since 1980, causing him to miss several weeks of training mid season. Despite this he managed to set some fast times {{towards the end of the}} season, but was to lose his Mile world record <b>to</b> <b>Cram,</b> who beat him in Oslo. In 1986 Coe won the gold medal over 800 m at the European Championships in Stuttgart, beating Tom McKean and Cram. with a stunning last 200 m of 24.8 and 100m in 12.4. It was his only 800 m title at an international championship. He won the silver in the 1500 metres, behind Cram, after running a bad tactical race, and set a personal best over 1500 m with a 3:29.77 min performance in Rieti, Italy, becoming the fourth man in history, at the time, to break 3:30 for the 1500 m. For the fourth year in his career (1979, 1981, 1982 & 1986), he was ranked No. 1 in the world in the 800 metres and was in the top two for 1500 metres for the 5th time.|$|E

500|$|A Royal Commission {{established}} in 1842 {{to investigate the}} problem concluded that London's burial grounds were so overcrowded {{that it was impossible}} to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one. Sir Edwin Chadwick testified that each year, 20,000 adults and 30,000 children were being buried in less than [...] of already overcrowded burial grounds; the Commission heard that one cemetery, Spa Fields in Clerkenwell, designed to hold 1,000 bodies, contained 80,000 graves, and that gravediggers throughout London were obliged to shred bodies in order <b>to</b> <b>cram</b> the remains into available grave space.|$|E
500|$|In addition, as de Boer feared, the Ezri-centric episodes {{came in for}} criticism. DVD Talk {{described}} [...] "Prodigal Daughter" [...] as [...] "clearly {{an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>cram</b> some back-story into Ezri {{to make up for}} the fact that she's a new character", and [...] "Field of Fire" [...] as [...] "utterly generic". The former was also considered to be the weakest of the season by the crew on the series, with Behr apologising to de Boer for it afterwards. Writer Ronald D. Moore simply stated, [...] "It was just a mess." [...] The crew nicknamed it [...] "Audra Goes Home", a reference to the 1960s western television show The Big Valley.|$|E
500|$|Of {{particular}} inspiration were Liman's father's memoirs {{regarding his}} involvement in the investigation of the Iran–Contra affair. Many aspects of the Alexander Conklin character were based on his father's recollections of Oliver North. Liman admitted that he jettisoned much of the content of the novel beyond the central premise, in order to modernize the material and to conform it to his own beliefs regarding United States foreign policy. However, Liman was careful not <b>to</b> <b>cram</b> his political views down [...] "the audience's throat". There were initial concerns regarding the film's possible obsolescence and overall reception {{in the aftermath of the}} September 11 attacks, but these concerns proved groundless.|$|E
60|$|For Wilfred was {{an embarrassment}} to his family. He had never been strong, his public school career had been {{shortened}} by failure in health, and headaches in the summer, and coughs in the winter made it needful to keep him at home, and trust <b>to</b> <b>cramming</b> at Rockstone, enforced by his father's stern discipline and his mother's authoritative influence.|$|R
50|$|Before commentating on a match, Butler {{prepares for}} several hours, {{absorbing}} {{as much information}} as he can, but taking few notes, and likens it <b>to</b> <b>cramming</b> for an examination. He describes writing a match report, often under time pressure, as telling a story which does not necessarily have to follow the timeline of the match so long as it is entertaining and complete.|$|R
50|$|Active {{learning}} {{and critical thinking}} are two methods which emphasize the retention of material {{through the use of}} class discussions, study groups and individual thinking. Each has been cited as a more effective means of {{learning and}} retaining information as compared <b>to</b> <b>cramming</b> and memorization. On the other hand <b>cramming</b> suits better <b>to</b> the sciolistic knowledge actually required by the academic examination method.|$|R
500|$|The {{brothers}} were parted in 1883; George {{continued in the}} navy and Albert Victor attended Trinity College, Cambridge. At Bachelor's Cottage, Sandringham, Albert Victor was expected <b>to</b> <b>cram</b> before arriving at university {{in the company of}} Dalton, French instructor Monsieur Hua, and a newly chosen tutor/companion James Kenneth Stephen. Some biographers have said that Stephen was a misogynist, although this has recently been questioned, and he may have felt emotionally attached to Albert Victor, but whether or not his feelings were overtly homosexual is open to question. Stephen was initially optimistic about tutoring the prince, {{but by the time the}} party were to move to Cambridge had concluded, [...] "I do not think he can possibly derive much benefit from attending lectures at Cambridge... He hardly knows the meaning of the words to read".|$|E
500|$|While {{he is in}} the [...] "Island", Homer is {{repeatedly}} gassed by unexpected objects, {{a reference}} to the way Number Six would often be gassed in The Prisoner. [...] "George [...] and I used to laugh a lot about how often [...] would be gassed by unexpected devices in the show", Scully said in the episode's DVD commentary. [...] "And we wanted <b>to</b> <b>cram</b> as many in as we could." [...] While escaping the [...] "Island", Homer is chased by a [...] "big balloon". The balloon is a reference to Rover, a floating white ball in The Prisoner that was created to keep inhabitants in the [...] "Village", which was also featured in the season 9 episode The Joy of Sect. The music heard in the scene is based on The Prisoners theme music.|$|E
500|$|Writing {{segments}} for [...] "Simpsons Tall Tales" [...] {{was much}} different from normal episodes; for example, the writers only had one day to outline each segment's plot, and three to four days to write {{the first draft of}} each script, which is much less time than the writers usually get for an episode. Still, Selman has said that working on the episode was [...] "very fun" [...] for the writers. While writing the third segment, Selman listened to Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective on tape to [...] "get some of the lingo" [...] that Mark Twain used in his books. He found so many unusual words in the books that he compiled a [...] "giant" [...] list of them. [...] "We wanted <b>to</b> <b>cram</b> in every single [...] as we could", Selman said in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E

I didn't want to think or to lay eyes on anybody who was liable to think.|$|R
500|$|Tool was {{described}} by Patrick Donovan of The Age as [...] "the thinking person's metal band. Cerebral and visceral, soft and heavy, melodic and abrasive, tender and brutal, familiar and strange, western and eastern, beautiful and ugly, taut yet sprawling and epic, they are a tangle of contradictions." [...] Tool has gained critical praise from the International Herald Tribunes C.B. Liddell for their complex and ever-evolving sound. Describing their general sound, AllMusic refers to them as [...] "grinding, post-Jane's Addiction heavy metal", and The New York Times sees similarities to [...] "Led Zeppelin's heaving, battering guitar riffs and Middle Eastern modes". Their 2001 work Lateralus was compared by Allmusic to Pink Floyd's Meddle (1971), but thirty years later and altered by [...] "Tool's impulse <b>to</b> <b>cram</b> every inch of infinity with hard guitar meat and absolute dread". Tool had been labelled as post-metal in 1993 and 1996, {{as well as in}} 2006, after the term came into popularity.|$|E
500|$|Birmingham's {{government}} {{was set up}} {{in such a way that}} it gave Connor powerful influence. In 1958, police arrested ministers organizing a bus boycott. When the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initiated a probe amid allegations of police misconduct for the arrests, Connor responded that he [...] " [...] got any damn apology to the FBI or anybody else", and predicted, [...] "If the North keeps trying <b>to</b> <b>cram</b> this thing [...] down our throats, there's going to be bloodshed." [...] In 1961, Connor delayed sending police to intervene when Freedom Riders were beaten by local mobs. The police harassed religious leaders and protest organizers by ticketing cars parked at mass meetings and entering the meetings in plainclothes to take notes. The Birmingham Fire Department interrupted such meetings to search for [...] "phantom fire hazards". Connor was so antagonistic towards the Civil Rights Movement that his actions galvanized support for black Americans. [...] President John F. Kennedy later said of him, [...] "The Civil Rights movement should thank God for Bull Connor. He's helped it as much as Abraham Lincoln." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A-, writing that [...] "The structure of 'White Rabbit' {{is kind of}} half-formed, {{in a way that}} strikes me as very similar to the structure of 'Tabula Rasa', but I think that feeling of everything having been tossed together at the last minute suits the episode in a way it didn’t the earlier one." [...] VanDerWerff also writes, [...] "the more I think about this episode, the more I admire it for taking away Jack’s agency." [...] IGN reviewer Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.9/10, writing that it [...] "features one of the best flashbacks dedicated to Jack." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave [...] "White Rabbit" [...] a 72/100, praising on how the writers did another [...] "character heavy" [...] episode without [...] "trying <b>to</b> <b>cram</b> unnecessary action." [...] However, Pierson added that the cliff scene was clichéd, particularly as [...] "we don’t really believe that he will die, so it is an action movie scene which we probably didn’t leave." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Galentine's Day" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez said, [...] "The show managed <b>to</b> <b>cram</b> more {{character development}} into 22 minutes than I thought possible. Almost every couple {{had a major}} milestone of sorts last night." [...] Gonzalez complimented the acting of Aziz Ansari during his moments with Wendy, and praised the [...] "touching moment" [...] between Ron and Leslie when {{she realized she had}} to break up with Justin. Steve Kandell of New York magazine appreciated that Leslie was correct about Frank, and that Justin was the ignorant one. Kandell said the senior dance served as a [...] "poignant backdrop" [...] for the episode's romantic subplots, but said the most intriguing show's relationship is between Leslie and Ron. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode was funny, but focused more attention on advancing various romantic subplots. Sepinwall said the scenes about Ann and Mark were [...] "a nice reaction to the general blandness of that relationship", but found it [...] "frustrating" [...] that the episode left the reason for Wendy and Tom's resolution unclear in [...] "Galentine's Day".|$|E
500|$|... "Hold On to Sixteen" [...] {{received}} a mixed reception from reviewers, though {{the music was}} more favorably received. Robert Canning of IGN called it [...] "very underwhelming" [...] and gave it an [...] "okay" [...] rating of 6.5 out of 10; he noted that competition episodes {{such as this one}} spend more time on performance, and deemed the non-performance segments [...] "blase". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman characterized [...] "the moral of this week's story: embrace your youth" [...] as [...] "overkill", but noted that once the competition began, the episode [...] "succeeded in spite of itself". Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "feel-good episode" [...] that came as a [...] "huge relief" [...] after the show [...] "had lost its moral footing these last few weeks", and AOLTV Crystal Bell said it gave her [...] "some hope {{for the rest of the}} season". Rae Votta of Billboard summarized the episode this way: [...] "Overall, it was a Glee that felt like the plots were dealt with as fast as humanly possible <b>to</b> <b>cram</b> in as much singing and dancing as we can." ...|$|E
500|$|Public {{health policy}} {{at this time}} was shaped by the miasma theory (the belief that {{airborne}} particles released by decaying flesh were the primary factor in the spread of contagious illness), and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded {{that it was impossible}} to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one. Commissioner and sanitation campaigner Edwin Chadwick testified that each year, 20,000 adults and 30,000 children were being buried in less than [...] of already full burial grounds; the Commission heard that one cemetery, Spa Fields in Clerkenwell, designed to hold 1,000 bodies, contained 80,000 graves, and that gravediggers throughout London were obliged to shred bodies in order <b>to</b> <b>cram</b> the remains into available grave space. In 1848–49 a cholera epidemic killed 14,601 people in London and overwhelmed the burial system completely. Bodies were left stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves were exhumed to make way for new burials.|$|E
40|$|Procrastination, or to against better {{judgment}} postpone a task, {{is a very}} common problem in general, and for university students in particular where about 50 % procrastinate consistently and problematically. In learning contexts, procrastination leads <b>to</b> <b>cramming</b> strategies, where the major part of studying activities occurs close to the exam instead of spreading the learning over time, which generally is believed to give better learning. This paper describes a course module on procrastination and the preliminary results from running the module with about 230 students in media technology. QC 2012082...|$|R

500|$|In {{spite of}} noting that Diplo makes Madonna sound fun on the song, Gavin Haynes of NME {{commented that the}} song's {{composition}} [...] "showed the gulf between [...] life and her music is now impossible to ignore". Calling it [...] "awry", Alexis Petridis of The Guardian claimed that [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna" [...] is [...] "a fantastic title {{in search of a}} song. In lieu of one, producer Diplo comes up with a kind of hybrid of EDM and happy hardcore and throws Nicki Minaj at her most hyperactive into the mix; the result genuinely sets your teeth on edge." [...] Criticizing Rebel Heart for being [...] "overworked", Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine found that [...] "the duality of its title [...] muddled by the inclusion of garish party jams like the infuriatingly catchy but lyrically cringe-inducing 'Bitch I'm Madonna'". John Murphy of musicOMH remarked that the song [...] "never quite lives up to its fantastic title, and just sounds a bit of a mess, trying <b>to</b> <b>cram</b> in Diplo-produced dance-hall rhythms, a dubstep breakdown and the seemingly now obligatory Nicki Minaj guest rap". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters opined that the song—and another Rebel Heart track, [...] "Illuminati"—"absolutely reek of desperation, wanting so badly to shock and offend listeners that they fail to resolve as satisfying songs first and foremost".|$|E
