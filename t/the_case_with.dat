40|$|With {{the purpose}} to {{study on the}} {{pathologic}} physiology of kidney in aged people, the weight and histological findings of kidney were observed on <b>the</b> autopsy <b>cases</b> without <b>the</b> cause of death of renal disease in each age over 60 years old for 3 years in 1955 - 58, besides, {{the relation between the}} histological findings and renal function was observed on <b>the</b> 25 <b>cases</b> of aged people over 58 years old by the kidney autopsy under the classification of normal blood pressure, arterial hypertension and essential hypertension, and the renal function was observed on them with the classification of blood pressure in each age. And the results were as follows. 1. The weight of kidney in aged people decreased with the decline on renal function and it was remarkable in higher aged people. 2. The decline of renal function and the degree of damage in each tissue became remarkable with their years and with the fixation of their blood pressure as arterial hypertension or essential hypertension in comparison with the people with normal blood pressure. 3. As for the correlation between the blood pressure and the degree of damage in each tissue, it was insignificant in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> normal blood pressure, but the correlation between the rise of blood pressure and the sclerosis of minor artery was observed on <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> essential hypertension in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> hypertension. 4. No definite correlation between the findings of eyeground and the degree of damage in each tissue was not observed on <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> normal blood pressure or hypertension, but considerable correlation between the sclerosis of minor artery and the findings of eyeground was found in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> essential hypertension. 5. No close relation between the decline of PSP value below 25 % in 15 minutes and the degree of damage in each tissue was not observed, but the PSP value in 15 minutes declined with the increase of ages and blood pressure and there was considerable correlation between PSP and RRF. 6. The good results of GFR was numerous and the degree of damage in each tissue was slight in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> normal blood pressure, but there was considerable correlation between the degree of damage in various tissues and the GFR value declined with the increased of ages and blood pressure as same as the decline of PSP. 7. The degree of damage in each tissue and RPF was slight in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> normal blood pressure. And there was considerable correlation between the degree of damage in various tissue and RPF in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> hypertension and their correlation was more remarkable in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> essential hypertension than that in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> arterial hypertension. 8. As for the correlation to FF, there were many people showing high value of FF over the average value of 0. 22 and FF incresed with the rise of blood pressure and the severe damage of tissue in many cases. 9. As for the correlation to RR, RR decreased, with the rise of blood pressure and the severe damage of tissue. 10. No fixed correlation was not observed on NPN in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> normal blood pressure and hypertension. 11. The degree of damage in each tissue and albuminuria were slight in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> normal blood pressure, but there was correlation betetween the degree of damage in each tissue and albuminuria in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> hypertension. 12. As for the correlation between the sclerosis of renal blood vessels and RBF, the fixed correlation was not always observed on <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> normal blood presure or arteriosclerotic hypertension, but both of arterio-and arteriolar sclerosis had close relation to RBF in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> essential hypertension. 13.

Although necessary, these shortcuts are susceptible to cognitive biases and may cause diagnostic errors. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the occurrence of inappropriate selectivity in the information-gathering and information-processing stages of the diagnostic process and study how it relates to diagnostic errors and patient harm in clinical practice. Expert internists reviewed the patient records of 247 dyspnea patients of five acute-care hospitals in the Netherlands, to detect reasoning faults, diagnostic errors and patient harm. <b>The</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> reasoning faults were discussed with the treating physicians. Based on the record review and the clarifications from the treating physicians, the occurrence of inappropriate selectivity in information-gathering and information-processing was established and related to the occurrence of diagnostic errors and patient harm. Inappropriate selectivity in the diagnostic reasoning process occurred in 45. 7 % (113 of 247) of <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> Specifically, selective information-gathering occurred in 33. 2 % of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> and selective information-processing in 12. 6 % of <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> Diagnostic errors occurred in 18. 3 % of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> selective information-gathering, and in 35. 5 % of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> selective information-processing.
