To tackle this problem, we propose to <b>separate</b> <b>the</b> sources in two stages. In the first stage, <b>the</b> sources are <b>separated</b> from <b>the</b> mixed signal. In the second stage, the interference between <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources and <b>the</b> distortions are reduced using deep neural networks (DNNs). We propose two methods that use DNNs {{to improve the quality}} of <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources in <b>the</b> second stage. In the first method, each separated source is improved individually using its own trained DNN, while in the second method all <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources are improved together using a single DNN. To further improve the quality of <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources, <b>the</b> DNNs in the second stage are trained discriminatively to further decrease the interference and the distortions of <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources. Our experimental results show that using two stages of separation improves the quality of <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> signals by decreasing the interference between <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> sources and distortions compared to <b>separating</b> <b>the</b> sources using a single stage of separation...|$|R
