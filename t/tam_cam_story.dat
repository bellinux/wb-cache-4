[...] It {{is one of the oldest}} known variants of Cinderella, first published in the Tang dynasty compilation Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang written around 850 by Duan Chengshi.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Story</b> of <b>Tấm</b> and <b>Cám</b> (<b>Tấm</b> <b>Cám)</b> is {{an ancient}} Vietnamese fairy tale.|$|R
50|$|In the Vietnamese version <b>Tam</b> <b>Cam,</b> <b>Tam</b> is mistreated by {{both her}} father's co-wife and half-sister. After her fishing {{achievements}} are unjustly stolen by the stepsister, she brings {{the only remaining}} fish home and feeds it as a pet. Her jealous step-family kills the fish and eats it, but its bones continue to serve as her protector and guardian, eventually leading her to become the king's bride during a festival. The protagonist takes violent revenge in part two of the story; after being murdered four times by her stepmother and stepsister, she eventually comes {{back from the dead}} and boils her stepsister alive, indirectly resulting in the death of her stepmother.|$|R
50|$|Famous Vietnamese {{fairy tales}} include The Hundred-knot Bamboo Tree and The <b>Story</b> of <b>Tấm</b> and <b>Cám.</b> Various tales have been {{translated}} into English, as well as folk tales containing some elements of fairy tales.|$|R

50|$|Later when Tấm had {{returned}} to the palace, <b>Cám</b> asked <b>Tấm</b> about her beauty secret, <b>Tấm</b> told <b>Cám</b> that to be beautiful, just take a bath in boiling water. Cám did exactly what Tấm said and was boiled alive.|$|R
5000|$|The reverence {{of these}} trees {{in their native}} range is {{reflected}} by their use as floral emblems. In Indonesia, D. celebica (Makassar ebony, known locally as Eboni) is the provincial tree of Central Sulawesi, while Ajan kelicung (D. macrophylla) is that of West Nusa Tenggara. The emblem of the Japanese island of Ishigaki is the Yaeyama kokutan (D. ferrea). The Gold apple (D. decandra), called [...] "Trái thị" [...] in Vietnamese, is a tree in the <b>Tấm</b> <b>Cám</b> fable. It is also the provincial tree of Chanthaburi as well as Nakhon Pathom Provinces in Thailand, while the Black-and-white ebony (D. malabarica) is that of Ang Thong Province. The name of the Thai district Amphoe Tha Tako, literally means [...] "District of the Diospyros pier", the latter being a popular local gathering spot.|$|R
50|$|One day, the {{stepmother}} sent <b>Tấm</b> and <b>Cám</b> fishing, {{promising to}} reward {{the girl who}} caught the most fish with a new yếm. Cám knew her mother would never punish her, therefore {{instead of trying to}} catch fish, she bathed carelessly in the river while Tấm was working hard. When Cám noticed all the fish <b>Tấm</b> had caught, <b>Cám</b> advised <b>Tấm</b> to wash the mud out of her hair or else she would be scolded by their mother. As Tấm went out to the river to wash her hair, Cám poured all the fish Tấm had caught into her own basket and ran home.|$|R
5000|$|Young, whose Father Knows Best {{had ended}} {{production}} a year earlier, was cast as Cameron [...] "Cam" [...] Garrett Brooks, a widower-author, who {{returns to his}} hometown of fictional Millsberg, possibly in New England, but no state is ever given as {{the location of the}} series. Cam renews his friendship with Lloyd Ramsey, the editor of the local newspaper, portrayed in eleven episodes by Ford Rainey. The people of Millsberg become the subjects of <b>Cam's</b> <b>stories.</b>|$|R

5000|$|It is {{a popular}} tree in Vietnam where it is grown in urban areas and close to temples. It is called [...] "cây thị" [...] in Vietnamese and it has {{appeared}} in Vietnamese folklore, such as The <b>Story</b> of <b>Tam</b> and <b>Cam.</b> It is also the provincial tree of Chanthaburi Province, Thailand; its Thai name is ลูกจันทร์ [...] "luuk-jan". It is a small plant (about 5-6 m tall). Its leaves are 6-8 cm long and 3-4 cm wide with a pointed tip.|$|R

50|$|Acclaimed children’s author David A. Adler {{has written}} a new <b>Cam</b> Jansen short <b>story</b> {{specifically}} for Jack and Jill, which {{will appear in the}} Sep/Oct 2012 issue.|$|R
50|$|Cam (Eric Stonestreet) meets a few {{residents}} of the retirement community and when he sees that they have some common interests, he spends time with them, talking about books and playing Mahjong. The women are insatiable gossips, just like <b>Cam,</b> and the <b>stories</b> he overhears are proved valuable later.|$|R
50|$|Further {{analysis}} of the tales shows that in Cinderella, The Wonderful Birch, The <b>Story</b> of <b>Tam</b> and <b>Cam,</b> Ye Xian, and Aschenputtel, the heroine is persecuted by her stepmother and refused permission {{to go to the}} ball or other event, and in Fair, Brown and Trembling and Finette Cendron by her sisters and other female figures, and these are grouped as 510A; while in Cap O' Rushes, Catskin, and Allerleirauh, the heroine is driven from home by her father's persecutions, and must take work in a kitchen elsewhere, and these are grouped as 510B. But in Katie Woodencloak, she is driven from home by her stepmother's persecutions and must take service in a kitchen elsewhere, and in Tattercoats, she is refused permission to go to the ball by her grandfather. Given these features common with both types of 510, Katie Woodencloak is classified as 510A because the villain is the stepmother, and Tattercoats as 510B because the grandfather fills the father's role.|$|R
50|$|From the {{feathers}} rose a beautiful white cedar tree. Its shade was so soothing that the King ordered a hammock {{to be made}} under it, and to his immense liking, he always dreamed about his late wife Tấm when he rested under that tree. Cám was jealous again when she learned about it so she told her mother, who instructed Cám to chop down the tree and make a loom out of its wood. But later on, when Cám sat on the loom and tried to weave some cloth, the decorative crow on the loom spoke with <b>Tấm's</b> voice, accusing <b>Cám</b> of stealing her husband.|$|R
5000|$|FIFA 17 {{introduced}} a new single-player story campaign mode, [...] "The Journey", for PS4, Xbox One and Windows. Players {{assume the role of}} Alex Hunter (voiced and modeled by Adetomiwa Edun), a young footballer trying to make his mark in the Premier League. The player is able to select any Premier League club to play for {{at the beginning of the}} season. The player can play in an upfield position, RW, ST, LW and <b>CAM</b> only. The <b>story</b> mode also features a dialogue wheel, similar to the Mass Effect series.|$|R
5000|$|Ball, Ballgown, and Curfew: The {{number of}} balls varies, {{sometimes}} one, sometimes two, and sometimes three. The fairy godmother is Perrault's own {{addition to the}} tale. The person who aided Cinderella (Aschenputtel) in the Grimms's version is her dead mother. Aschenputtel requests her aid by praying at her grave, on which a tree is growing. Helpful doves roosting in the tree shake down the clothing she needs for the ball. This motif is found in other variants of the tale as well, such as The Cinder Maid, collected by Joseph Jacobs, and the Finnish The Wonderful Birch. Playwright James Lapine incorporated this motif into the Cinderella plotline of the musical Into the Woods. Giambattista Basile's Cenerentola combined them; the Cinderella figure, Zezolla, asks her father to commend her to the Dove of Fairies and ask her to send her something, and she receives a tree that will provide her clothing. Other variants have her helped by talking animals, as in Katie Woodencloak, Rushen Coatie, Bawang Putih Bawang Merah, The <b>Story</b> of <b>Tam</b> and <b>Cam,</b> or The Sharp Grey Sheep—these animals often having some connection with her dead mother; in The Golden Slipper, a fish aids her after she puts it in water. In [...] "The Anklet", it's a magical alabaster pot the girl purchased with her own money that brings her the gowns and the anklets she wears to the ball. Gioachino Rossini, having agreed to do an opera based on Cinderella if he could omit all magical elements, wrote La Cenerentola, {{in which she was}} aided by Alidoro, a philosopher and formerly the Prince's tutor.|$|R
50|$|On April 28, 2004, {{geologist}} Pasquale Scaturro and his partner, kayaker and documentary filmmaker Gordon Brown, {{became the}} first known people to navigate the Blue Nile. Though their expedition included a number of others, Brown and Scaturro {{were the only ones}} to remain on the expedition for the entire journey. They chronicled their adventure with an IMAX camera and two handheld video <b>cams,</b> sharing their <b>story</b> in the IMAX film Mystery of the Nile and in a book of the same title. The team was forced to use outboard motors for most of their journey, and it was not until January 29, 2005, when Canadian Les Jickling and New Zealander Mark Tanner reached the Mediterranean Sea, that the river had been paddled {{for the first time in}} recorded history with human power from source to sea.|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis by {{publication}} {{is composed}} of five peer-reviewed papers reporting on findings from data collected and analysed over a five year period. Each paper relates {{to the theme of}} the Media Doctor website as a tool for assessing and improving the quality of health reporting in the general Australian news media. The first paper (Chapter 3) “Monitoring the quality of medical news reporting: Early experience with ‘media doctor’“ presents early data, providing a baseline overview of health reporting using the four categories of pharmaceutical, surgical, diagnostic testing and ‘other’ stories. In Chapter 4, the second paper, “Media Reporting of Health Intervention: Signs of Improvement but Major Problems Persist” examines the changes in the quality of news stories in these categories. This paper also provides an analysis of how the individual items on the rating instrument differed between subject categories, outlets and over time. In Chapter 5, the third paper, “Does it matter who writes medical news stories“ looks at differences in story quality by examining different author categories and whether news stories written by certain types of journalists have significant differences. The fourth and fifth papers examine the quality of news reporting of two specific types of story: 1) Complementary and Alternative Medicines (<b>CAM)</b> and 2) <b>Stories</b> about cancer (Chapter 6). “An analysis of news media coverage of complementary and alternative medicine” identified all news stories on the website that dealt with CAM interventions and analysed these in order to assess the overall quality compared with the scores of stories about mainstream health interventions. The fifth paper of the thesis “Deconstructing Cancer: What makes a good quality news story” looks at how the reporting of a specific disease, cancer, performs across both subject categories and rating items. This thesis also examines the state of knowledge in the existing literature via extensive literature review of interventions to improve the reporting of health news stories, {{and the development of a}} validated rating instrument. The thesis concludes by summarising the papers’ findings to give an overall assessment of the quality of health news stories in Australia. The data reveals the strongest and weakest facets of health reporting and which media outlets and writers produced the ‘best’ and ‘worst’ quality health news stories in the context of the quality scores awarded using the rating instrument. It examines the impact of these findings on public health and explores interventions to improve reporting in this area...|$|R
