25|$|In 1652 Sir Hamon L'Estrange, an English author {{writing on}} {{topics such as}} history and {{theology}} published an exegetical tract called Americans no Jews, or improbabilities that <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> of that Race in response to the tract by Thorowgood. In response to L'Estrange, Thorowgood published a second edition of his book in 1660 with a revised title and included a foreword written by John Eliot, a Puritan missionary to the Indians who had translated the Bible into an Indian language.|$|E
25|$|Raymont {{said that}} the series and the issues in the show are drawn from issues that {{currently}} face Canada {{and the rest of}} the world such as 9/11, the Darfur Crisis, human rights violations in China and trans-national crimes such as pedophiles and international crime rings. He also said that he wanted to show the Canadian perspective in facing national security issues that would affect the country. Raymont wanted to show viewers that Canadians are more understanding and open-minded than <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1650, a British divine named Thomas Thorowgood, who was {{a preacher}} in Norfolk, {{published}} a book entitled Jewes in America or Probabilities that <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> of that Race, which he had prepared for the New England missionary society. Tudor Parfitt writes:The society was active in trying to convert the Indians but suspected {{that they might be}} Jews and realized they better be prepared for an arduous task. Thorowgood's tract argued that the native population of North America were descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes.|$|E

25|$|The exile of Edom {{began with}} Rome, whose culture lacked any clearly defined philosophy. Rather, it adopted the philosophies {{of all the}} {{preceding}} cultures, causing Roman culture {{to be in a}} constant flux. Although the Roman Empire has fallen, the Jews are still in the exile of Edom, and indeed, one can find this phenomenon of ever-changing trends dominating modern western society. The Romans and the various nations who inherited their rule (e.g., the Holy Roman Empire, the Europeans, <b>the</b> <b>Americans)</b> <b>are</b> lopsided towards Malchut, sovereignty, the lowest Sefirah, which can be received from any of the others, and can act as a medium for them.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the very}} {{interesting}} features of Indo-USA relations of recent times is the changes on the terms of engagement {{between the two countries}} on the issue of nuclear proliferation. While earlier, in the USA strategic thinking on nuclear proliferation, India figured mainly because of American concern about latter's nuclear and missile programmes, in the twenty-first century, however, American strategic thinking on the issue of nuclear proliferation has undergone major reorientation. Now, <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> increasingly realising the futility of insisting on a rollback of India's nuclear programme. They, rather, want to leverage India's growing power and influence in favour of their broader nonproliferation and counter proliferation objectives.|$|E
25|$|The FBI team {{is invited}} to the palace of Saudi Prince Ahmed bin Khaled for a dinner. While at the palace, Fleury persuades the Prince that Colonel al-Ghazi is a natural detective and {{should be allowed to}} lead the investigation. With this change in leadership, <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> allowed {{hands-on}} access to the crime scene. While searching for evidence, Sergeant Haytham and Sykes discover the second bomb was detonated in an ambulance. Fleury learns the brother of one of the dead terrorists had access to ambulances and police uniforms. Colonel al-Ghazi orders a SWAT team to raid a house, managing to kill a few heavily armed terrorists. Following the raid, the team discovers clues, including photos of the U.S. and other Western embassies in Riyadh. Soon afterward, the U.S. Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Damon Schmidt notifies Fleury and his team that they have been ordered to return to the United States.|$|E

500|$|From {{the early}} drafts, Hammerstein and Logan made {{the issue of}} racial {{prejudice}} central to the story. Hammerstein repeatedly rewrote the Act II backstage scene where Emile, Nellie and Cable confront {{the question of the}} Americans' racism. As critic Robert Butler pointed out in his educational companion to the 2001 London production, [...] "if one young person has a prejudice, it might be a character flaw; if two young people share a prejudice, it tells us something about the society in which they grew up". In one draft, Emile advises that <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> no better than the Axis Powers, in their prejudice, and suggests they go home to sing songs about how all are created free and equal. [...] Lovensheimer states that a postwar American audience would have found such onstage sentiments to be offensive. In the staged version, Emile's expressions are limited to two lines arguing that prejudice is not inborn.|$|E

[...] Obama mentioned that he had spent several years {{growing up in the}} world's most populous Muslim nation, Indonesia, and called for resumed negotiations between Israel and Palestinians.

2500|$|After taking office, Obama stated {{his support}} for the {{creation}} of a Palestinian state and announced that he would engage in negotiations with Iran. He also declared he opposed Israeli settlements and wanted to revive peace talks. In an interview to Al Arabiya, few days after his inauguration, Obama declared: [...] "my job to the Muslim world is to communicate that <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> not your enemy." [...] "White House Spokesman Robert Gibbs stated he will review particular issues of concern, such as violent extremism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and he will discuss new areas for partnership going forward that serve the mutual interests of our people." [...] The President had planned to mend America's relationship with the Middle East.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 February 2013, {{speaking}} at the Munich Security Conference, U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden said that the Obama Administration [...] "would be prepared to meet bilaterally with the Iranian leadership. We would not make it a secret that we were doing that. We would let our partners know if that occasion presented itself. That offer stands, {{but it must be}} real and tangible, and {{there has to be an}} agenda that they’re prepared to speak to. We are not just prepared to do it for the exercise." [...] A few days later Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected the offer and added ambiguously: [...] "The U.S. policies in the Middle East have failed and <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> in need of a winning hand. That is bringing Iran to the negotiating table." [...] On 4 February the Italian news-wire [...] "Agenzia Nova", citing [...] "sources in Teheran," [...] reported that [...] "from the beginning of the year Ali Larijani, Speaker of the (Iranian) Parliament, secretly traveled twice to the United States" [...] to launch direct negotiations with the Obama Administration. The Italian Agency explained that U.S. diplomacy was waiting for the Presidential election in Iran, that most probably will see a dramatic change in Iranian approach. It was reported on 17 June Iran’s newly elected president Hassan Rohani had expressed readiness for bilateral talks with Washington, with conditions.|$|E
