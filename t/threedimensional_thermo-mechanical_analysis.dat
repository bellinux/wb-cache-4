40|$|The paper {{considers}} a fully coupled <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>analysis</b> of one-layered and multilayered isotropic and composite plates. In the proposed analysis, {{the temperature is}} considered a primary variable as the displacement; it is therefore directly obtained from the model and this feature permits the temperature field to be evaluated through the thickness direction in three different cases: - static analysis with imposed temperature on the external surfaces; - static analysis of structures subjected to a mechanical load, {{with the possibility of}} considering the temperature field effects; - a free vibration problem, with the evaluation of the temperature field effects. In the first case, imposing a temperature at {{the top and bottom of}} the plate, the static response is given in term of displacements, stresses and temperature field; the proposed method is very promising if compared to a partially coupled <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>analysis,</b> where the temperature is only considered as an external load, and the temperature profile must be a priori defined: considering it linear through the thickness direction or calculating it by solving the Fourier heat conduction equation.

One of the most important durability problems in diesel engines is due to cracks in the valves bridge area. The {{purpose of this study is}} thermo [...] mechanical analysis of cylinder heads of diesel engines using a two-layer viscoplasticity mo-del. The results of the <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>analysis</b> indicate that the maximum temperature and stress occurr in the valves bridge. The results of the finite element analysis correspond with the experimental tests carried out by researchers, and illustrate cracks in cylinder heads in this region. The results of the <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>analysis</b> show that when the engine is running, the stress in the region is compressive, caused by thermal loading and combustion pressure. When the engine is shut off, the compressive stress turns into tensile stress because of assembly loads. The valves bridge is under cyclic tensile and compressive stress state and thus is subject to low cycle fatigue. After several cycles fatigue cracks will appear in this region.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>analysis</b> of a copper mould, which is a {{component}} that controls initial solidification in continuous steel casting. Large temperature gradients, caused by a huge thermal flux imposed by steel, are responsible for high stresses and plastic strains. Plant switch-off also induces residual stresses which may increase with repeated thermal cycling over a casting sequence. Furthermore, oscillations of the melt metal level determine a fluctuation of the temperature peak {{on the surface of}} the mould. As a result, thermal fatigue cracks tend to develop on the mould inner surface, especially for increased productivity rates characterized by higher casting speed and thermal flux. This work aims to study the mechanical behaviour of the mould and to propose a simplified approach to relate stress-strain cycles to the component fatigue life. A <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>analysis</b> is performed by a finite element elasto-plastic model, supported by simplified analytical models useful to interpret results.

40|$|A 10 {{channels}} interferometer {{will be used}} in the Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X) for {{plasma density}} control and density profile tracking with laser beams passing through the plasma. Due to complex shape of non-planar modular coils and divertor structure, there are no large poloidally opposite ports on the plasma vessel (PV). Therefore 10 in-vessel Corner Cube Retro-reflectors (CCRs) will be used. The CCRs are integrated in the water cooled heat shield and exposed directly to thermal loads from plasma radiation. Thermo-mechanical issues are very important for the design of the CCR because deformation and flatness as well as mutual angles of the three reflecting surfaces would affect the parallelism of the laser beams and the functionality of the interferometer. Intensive work has been done to explore a suitable design for the CCR concerning thermo-mechanical behavior. Previous studies Ye et al. (2008, 2009) and Köppen et al. (2011) focused on structural optimization to decrease thermal stress in the reflecting plates under the thermal loads, and on computation and check of curvature radii of the deformed reflecting surfaces with the design criterion that the curvature radius must be bigger than 200 m.
