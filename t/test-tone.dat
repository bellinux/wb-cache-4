40|$|Introduction The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} with the MEG differences in the central auditory process caused by the strain of 4 hours disco-music. The noise level in discos with peaks up to 130 dB can cause permanent hearing defects beside the temporary threshold shift. Our question: Are there differences in central parts of the auditory system caused by the sound pressure level (SPL) of the discotheque and can (that) these be represented by MEG? 2 Methods The AEFs of 18 young healthy subjects with normal hearing (average age 19 years) were monitored with a 31 -channel Philips biomagnetometer using <b>test-tones</b> of 0. 5; 1; 2; 4; 5 kHz (bursts 505 ms rise time). The stimuli were applied contra laterally (always the right ear) through a specifically designed "Tube and Funnel System". To evaluate differences between the AEF before and after visiting a discotheque, we investigated the subjects first in the morning and second in the night, just after the visit to a disco. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} 1963 {{recording of}} the Doctor Who theme music {{is widely regarded as}} a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers. Delia Derbyshire (assisted by Dick Mills) of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop used musique concrète techniques to realise a score written by composer Ron Grainer. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of <b>test-tone</b> oscillators which were used for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music.The main, pulsing bassline rhythm was created from a recording of a single plucked string, played {{over and over again in}} different patterns created by splicing copies of the sound, with different pitches and notes achieved by playing the sample in different speeds. The swooping melody and lower bassline layer were created by manually adjusting the pitch of oscillator banks to a carefully timed pattern. The non-swooping parts of the melody were created by playing a keyboard attached to the oscillator banks. The rhythmic hissing sounds, [...] "bubbles" [...] and [...] "clouds", were created by cutting tape recordings of filtered white noise.|$|E
40|$|Psychophysical tuning curves were {{determined}} in hearing-impaired and normal-hearing subjects. Frequency selectivity, determined from the tuning curves of the hearing-impaired, decreased with increasing hearing impairment. As {{this may be}} attributed to the subjects' hearing impairment {{as well as to the}} inevitably higher test (probe) -tone level, we also collected psychophysical tuning curves from normal-hearing subjects as a function of <b>test-tone</b> level. Their frequency selectivity also decreased with <b>test-tone</b> level, but to a lesser degree. This indicates a real decrease in frequency selectivity in hearing-impaired subjects. Two measures were used to describe frequency selectivity, the d 1 oct and the newly introduced AALD. The latter is the average absolute difference in masker levels between the individual's psychophysical tuning curve and the average normal tuning curve, obtained at the same <b>test-tone</b> level. The AALD turned out to be a more sensitive tool for measuring pathological frequency selectivity than the d 1 oct...|$|E
40|$|A first {{experiment}} compared {{two methods}} {{for measuring the}} susceptibility to auditory fatigue. Fifteen subjects were exposed to a 1000 -Hz, 90 -dB SPL tone for 60 sec. The temporary loudness shift (TLS) of a 1000 -Hz, 55 -dB test tone was established by estimates of loudness (numbers), and also by adjustments of the <b>test-tone</b> level in order to reproduce the initial (pre-exposure) loudness. The correlation between the two values of TLS reaches 0. 85, however the TLS provided by the adjustment method is lesser (by an average of 8 dB) than the TLS deduced from the numerical estimates. A second experiment investigated the accuracy of loudness memorization by the method of level adjustment in the same paradigm as in the first experiment, but without the fatiguing tone. In some conditions, the memorized loudness is under-estimated (by about 4 dB) ...|$|E
40|$|Absolute {{thresholds}} {{and critical}} masking ratios were determined behaviorally for the European barn owl (Tyto alba guttata). It shows an excellent sensitivity throughout its hearing range {{with a minimum}} threshold of − 14. 2 [*]dB sound pressure level at 6. 3 [*]kHz, {{which is similar to}} the sensitivity found in the American barn owl (Tyto alba pratincola) and some other owls. Both the European and the American barn owl have a high upper-frequency limit of hearing exceeding that in other bird species. Critical masking ratios, that can provide an estimate for the frequency selectivity in the barn owl's hearing system, were determined with a noise of about 0 [*]dB spectrum level. They increased from 19. 1 [*]dB at 2 [*]kHz to 29. 2 [*]dB at 8 [*]kHz at a rate of 5. 1 [*]dB per octave. The corresponding critical ratio bandwidths were 81, 218, 562 and 831 [*]Hz for <b>test-tone</b> frequencies of 2, 4, 6. 3 and 8 [*]kHz, respectively. These values indicate, contrary to expectations based on the spatial representation of frequencies on the basilar papilla, increasing bandwidths of auditory filters in the region of the barn owl's auditory fovea. This increase, however, correlates with the increase in the bandwidths of tuning curves in the barn owl's auditory fovea...|$|E
