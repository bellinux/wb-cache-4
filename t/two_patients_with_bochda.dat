40|$|An {{endogenous}} colony formation assay {{was performed}} on 24 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> chronic myelogenous leukemia in the chronic phase (CML-CP), 11 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> CML-accerelated phase (CML-AP), nine <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> CML-blastic crisis (CML-BC),nine <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> polycythemia vera, <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> essential thrombocythemia, <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> primary myelofibrosis, <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> juvenile CML (JCML), one <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> chronic neutrophillic leukemia, <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> unclassified myeloproliferative disorder (UMPD), five <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), 10 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> RAEB in transformation (RAEBt) or overt leukemia, and 10 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Endogenous colony formation was observed in <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> CML-AP, one <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> CML-BC, <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> JCML, one <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> UMPD, one <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> RAEBt, and seven <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> CMML. All of these endogenous colonies were identified as CFU-C by chemical staining. In some <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> CML or RAEBt, endogenous colonies were observed when progression of disease occurred. Endogenous colony formation was partially inhibited by the depletion of phagocytes in five <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> CMML or RAEBt. Four of these patients revealed increased releases of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CFS) to the culture medium, {{and the addition of}} anti-GM-CSF antibody totally inhibited the formation of endogenous colony in one case. Patients who formed endogenous colonies often had chromosomal abnormalities and short survival. These findings suggest that paracrine or autocrine GM-CSF {{plays an important role in}} endogenous colony formation and that such endogenous colony formation is one of the risk factors in hematological malignancies...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Predominant {{cerebellar}} involvement has {{not been}} previ-ously reported as a common neuroradiologic feature in pediatric mitochondrial cytopathies. Here we report the neuroradiologic findings of predominant cerebellar volume loss in children with various mitochondrial disorders. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the medical records of 400 consecutive patients referred for evaluation of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies was performed. In 113 cases, definite diagnosis of mitochondrial disease {{was based on the}} modified adult criteria that include clinical, histologic, biochemical, functional, molecular, and metabolic parameters. RESULTS: Predominant cerebellar volume loss with progressive cerebellar atrophy and, less often, cerebellar hypoplasia were found in a heterogeneous group of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> mitochondrial disease that consisted of four <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> complex I deficiency; four <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> multiple respiratory chain deficiencies; <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> combined complex I III and II III deficiencies, including one <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> partial coenzyme Q 10 deficiency; three <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> complex II deficiency; <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> complex IV deficiency; one <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy; and <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> mitochondrial encephalomy...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: {{to study}} the {{frequency}} and specificity of sclera-specific and non-sclera-specific autoantibodies in the sera of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> anterior non-infectious scleritis. METHODS: prospective study involving 25 patients examined at the sector of Cornea and External Disease of the Department of Ophthalmology and Immuno-Rheumatology Laboratory at Federal University of São Paulo/Paulista Medicine School, during one year. The diagnosis of scleritis was according to Watson and Hayreh's (1976) classification criteria. The exclusion criterion was infectious scleritis. All the patients underwent a full clinical and ophthalmologic evaluation, including serological tests for syphilis and tuberculosis investigation. The following autoantibodies were tested: rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies), anti-SS-A/Ro, anti-SS-B/La, anti-Sm, anti-DNA and anti-APF (antiperinuclear factor). For sclera-specific autoantibodies, sera of all patients were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot assays, using human sclera from eye banks as a substrate. Sera from 25 healthy individuals were used as a normal control in the immunologic assays. RESULTS: as non-sclera-specific autoantibodies we detected one <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> positive rheumatoid factor, <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> positive antinuclear antibodies, <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> positive anticardiolipin antibody and <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> positive anti-APF. Sclera-specific autoantibodies were detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence in the serum of <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> scleritis. The <b>two</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> sclera-specific autoantibodies did not show non-sclera-specific autoantibodies and also presented no evidence of autoimmune rheumatic disease. Normal controls were negative for all tested autoantibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Sclera-specific autoantibodies were detected solely in the serum of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> isolated non-infectious anterior scleritis. Non-sclera-specific autoantibodies were observed in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> scleritis associated with autoimmune rheumatic disease and in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> isolated scleritis...|$|R
