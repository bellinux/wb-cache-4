5|$|Carbohydrates are {{aldehydes}} or ketones, {{with many}} hydroxyl groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates {{are the most}} abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of energy (starch, glycogen) and structural components (cellulose in plants, chitin in animals).

40|$|Electropermeabilization is {{a method}} by which {{molecules}} can be introduced in living cells through the plasma membrane. Here, we show that electropermeabilization affects the lateral mobility of Rae- 1, a GPi anchored protein. Our results shows that 10 to 20 % of the membrane surface is occupied by defaults or pores. Gene electrotransfert also affects the lateral mobility of Rae- 1. Furthermore, we clearly show that once inserted into the plasma membrane, DNA totaly excludes Rae- 1, indicating that DNA molecules are tightly packed <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>forms</b> huge aggregates...|$|R

5|$|Motile {{bacteria}} are attracted or repelled by certain stimuli in behaviours called taxes: these include chemotaxis, phototaxis, energy taxis, and magnetotaxis. In one peculiar group, the myxobacteria, individual bacteria move <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores.

This infuriated the LDP and Prime Minister Tarō Asō, saying this act was unforgivable. In response, DPJ President Yukio Hatoyama (who voted for the Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem) said that the banner was not the Hinomaru and should not be regarded as such.|$|E
5|$|Some RNA {{molecules}} play {{an active}} role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling gene expression, or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is protein synthesis, a universal function where RNA molecules direct the assembly of proteins on ribosomes. This process uses transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome, where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) then links amino acids <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> proteins.|$|E

He gathered several men, including Almaron Dickinson, also a former US Army field artilleryman, <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> the first artillery company of Texians. A local Methodist minister, W. P. Smith, blessed their activities in a sermon which made frequent reference to the American Revolution.|$|E

5|$|The {{array of}} a {{photovoltaic}} power system, or PV system, produces direct current (DC) power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. For practical use this usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current (AC), {{through the use}} of inverters. Multiple solar cells are connected inside modules. Modules are wired <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> arrays, then tied to an inverter, which produces power at the desired voltage, and for AC, the desired frequency/phase.|$|E

5|$|The {{body of a}} {{crustacean}} {{is composed}} of segments, which are grouped into three regions: the cephalon or head, the thorax, and the pleon or abdomen. The head and thorax may be fused <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> a cephalothorax, which may be covered by a single large carapace. The crustacean body is protected by the hard exoskeleton, which must be moulted for the animal to grow. The shell around each somite {{can be divided into}} a dorsal tergum, ventral sternum and a lateral pleuron. Various parts of the exoskeleton may be fused together.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} raffia {{plant was}} the base fiber for the clothing traditionally {{worn by the}} Betsimisaraka. Leaves of the raffia plant were combed to separate the fibers, which were knotted end to end to form strands that could then be woven <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> cloth. Among the various peoples who united under the Betsimisaraka confederation, women wore a short wrapper (simbo), typically with a bandeau top (akanjo), while men wore smocks. Traditional raffia clothing is still worn by some Betsimisaraka today.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of energy at the core is the reason stars shine so brightly: every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>form</b> a single atomic nucleus of a new heavier element, gamma ray photons are released from the nuclear fusion product.
