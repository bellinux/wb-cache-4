Due to the availability of active or "smart" materials, researchers in the machine tool industry are now focusing on applying active control to attenuate tool vibration during machining. In this thesis research, efforts are dedicated to investigating the mechanical and electrical behavior of a designed tool post structure in which lead-magnesium-niobate (PMN) actuators are used as built-in devices for vibration control. Research is focused on using finite element method (FEM) to identify the dynamic characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>post,</b> establishing an experimental testbed environment for experimental verifications, and implementing <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> in a shop floor machining environment to test its performance, both mechanically and electronically.

Significant findings of this research include 2 to 3 mm floating of the dynamic equilibrium position of the tool tip during the compensation, {{and the effect of}} interplay between actuator-driving frequency and workpiece rotation on in-process compensation. Control of the coupling coefficient deserves special, attention for maintaining an acceptable efficiency of conversion from electrical energy to mechanical energy.

Cutting tools are weak and there is continuous effort to improving their performance and wear characteristics so that different grades of materials with varied degree of hardness are machined at minimal cost and economies of production can be realized during machining. This study investigated the rate tool wear and the cutting forces involved during the machining process. High speed machine lathe (Type: MORESEKI) was used on which a three force component dynamometer was mounted on <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> to measure the cutting forces involved during the machining process. A Toolmakers microscope (model no: 80091) was used to measure the tool flank wear (VB) and the maximum tool wear recorded was 0. 27 mm and occurred at approximately 3. 0 minutes during the machining process. Design of Experiment based on Taguchi technique was developed to obtain the experimental data. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to analyze the data by developing 3 D surface plots, contour plots and Main effects plots for Signal to Noise Ratio. The residuals plots analysis for cutting force revealed a normal probability plot for the data used indicating a close fit to the best of line.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an approach to}} cutting dynamics during turning based upon the mechanism of deformation of work material around the tool nose known as "ploughing". Starting from the shearing process in the cutting zone and accounting for "ploughing", new mathematical models relating turning force components to cutting conditions, tool geometry and tool vibration are developed. These models are developed separately for steady state and for oscillatory turning with new and worn tools. Experimental results are used to determine mathematical functions expressing the parameters introduced by the steady state model {{in the case of}} a new tool. The form of these functions are of general validity though their coefficients are dependent on work and tool materials. Good agreement is achieved between experimental and predicted forces. The model is extended on one hand to include different work material by introducing a hardness factor. The model provides good predictions when predicted forces are compared to present and published experimental results. On the other hand, the extension of the ploughing model to taming with a worn edge showed the ability of the model in predicting machining forces during steady state turning with the worn flank of the tool. In the development of the dynamic models, the dynamic turning force equations define the cutting process as being a system for which vibration of the tool tip in the feed direction is the input and measured forces are the output The model takes into account the shear plane oscillation and the cutting configuration variation in response to tool motion. Theoretical expressions of the turning forces are obtained for new and worn cutting edges. The dynamic analysis revealed the interaction between the cutting mechanism and the machine tool structure. The effect of the machine tool and tool post is accounted for by using experimental data of the transfer function of <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>post</b> system. Steady state coefficients are corrected to include the changes in the cutting configuration with tool vibration and are used in the dynamic model. A series of oscillatory cutting tests at various conditions and various tool flank wear levels are carried out and experimental results are compared with model—predicted forces. Good agreement between predictions and experiments were achieved over a wide range of cutting conditions. This research bridges the gap between the analysis of vibration and turning forces in turning. It offers an explicit expression of the dynamic turning force generated during machining and highlights the relationships between tool wear, tool vibration and turning force. Spectral analysis of tool acceleration and turning force components led to define an "Inertance Power Ratio" as a flank wear monitoring factor. A formulation of an on—line flank wear monitoring methodology is presented and shows how the results of the present model can be applied to practical in—process tool wear monitoring in • turning operations...|$|E

Every tool is subjected to wear in machining. The wear of <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> is gradual and reaches certain limit of life which is identifiedwhen <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> no longer produce the parts to required quality.
