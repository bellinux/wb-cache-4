A compass is easier to use, though <b>the</b> <b>deviation</b> of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination {{must be taken into}} account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E

5|$|Celestial bodies {{interior}} to {{the orbit}} of Mercury have been hypothesized, and searched for, for centuries. The German astronomer Christoph Scheiner thought he had seen small bodies passing {{in front of the}} Sun in 1611, but these were later shown to be sunspots. In the 1850s, Urbain Le Verrier made detailed calculations of Mercury's orbit and found a small discrepancy in the planet's perihelion precession from predicted values. He postulated that the gravitational influence of a small planet or ring of asteroids within {{the orbit of}} Mercury would explain <b>the</b> <b>deviation.</b> Shortly afterward, an amateur astronomer named Edmond Lescarbault claimed to have seen Le Verrier's proposed planet transit the Sun. The new planet was quickly named Vulcan but was never seen again, and the anomalous behaviour of Mercury's orbit was explained by Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1915. The vulcanoids take their name from this hypothetical planet. What Lescarbault saw was probably another sunspot.|$|E

Law, was unaware that he was now in command of the division, so he could not exercise control.|$|E
25|$|On 6 November 1892 <b>the</b> <b>deviation</b> {{line between}} Haworth and Oakworth through Mytholmes Tunnel was {{opened and the}} {{original}} route abandoned. <b>The</b> <b>deviation</b> was built {{as a condition of}} the buy out of the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway by the Midland Railway.

25|$|The {{nonlinearity}} of the EFE makes finding exact solutions difficult.
