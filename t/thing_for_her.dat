In 1976, Indian designer Mohan Murjani's Murjani Corporation, proposed launching a line of designer jeans carrying Vanderbilt's signature embroidered on the back pocket, {{as well as her}} swan logo.

500|$|Murray {{viewed the}} holonovel as {{a space in}} which the series explores Janeway's social and romantic relationships. She pointed out that Janeway chose a {{narrative}} {{that focuses on the}} [...] "perils of the governess's intense social relationships rather than the physical terrors of the situation". According to Murray, the computer program was written to challenge Janeway's imagination and not her intellect. She added that the series approached Janeway's romance with the fictional Lord Burleigh as a serious [...] "exercise posing psychological and moral questions" [...] for the audience and characters to explore during the episodes. Van Riper included Janeway {{as an example of how}} fictional female captains are more likely to create or maintain romantic relationships during their voyages than fictional men. Taylor viewed the holonovel, specifically its use in [...] "Persistence of Vision", as central to Janeway's character development as it allowed her to move on from her previous relationship with her fiancée Mark Johnson (Stan Iver). During a discussion of her approach to Janeway's personal life, Taylor wrote: [...] "We cannot put her into romantic situations until she decides he has given her up for dead and moved on, and the only wise <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to do is the same". Murray noted that Janeway shares many features with the character Jane Eyre, particularly [...] "a strong resistance to being bullied, a willingness to stand on principle, and the courage to face fear and isolation head-on". She wrote that the holonovel allows viewers to see [...] "unexpected sides of familiar characters". Murray called Janeway a [...] "person of Victorian integrity" [...] and described the holonovel as opening a channel of exploration that brings her [...] "the benefit of self-knowledge" [...] in order to return her to [...] "the real world all the stronger".|$|E

Charlotte Perkins Gilman suffered a very serious bout of post-partum depression in the months after Katharine's birth. This was an age in which women were seen as [...] "hysterical" [...] and [...] "nervous" [...] beings; thus, when a woman claimed to be seriously ill after giving birth, her claims were sometimes dismissed as being invalid.|$|E

At the festival premiere, director Adria Petty said that Hilton [...] "created a mystery about herself that a film like this maybe wouldn't {{have been a great}} <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> in the past. But now, she's been so saturated in the media. We're so used to her. To see a new side of her is so exciting". In July 2009, the film was broadcast on MTV.|$|E

2500|$|David Browne {{reviewed}} the album for Entertainment Weekly and awarded it a [...] "B" [...] rating, calling Enya [...] "even less {{the life of}} the pub" [...] with her new release. [...] "With its layered, breathing-lesson choral harmonies cushioned in sullen keyboards, the album is, except for a few perky moments, wistful to the point of stultification. A gorgeous formula, but perhaps even Enya could use a good stiff belt." [...] The Los Angeles Times issued a three stars out of four rating in a review by Don Heckman. He wrote that Enya remains in her [...] "musical trance ... on an ethereal plateau of her own", which he recognises as a good <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> fans. The [...] "technical proficiency and the mood-sustaining qualities" [...] of the music, that Heckman called [...] "mysterious" [...] and [...] "rich" [...] coupled with Enya's [...] "angelic, folk soprano" [...] and [...] "nostalgic" [...] piano, flow to make a seamless album that [...] "almost demands that the album be heard in its entirety". Heckman praised Enya for the [...] "remarkable" [...] feat of being the album's sole musician, and concluded with: [...] "If anything can restore the tarnished image of New Age music, this may be it". Rolling Stone magazine reporter Elysa Gardner gave the album three stars out of four. She wrote: [...] "Because Enya's lush, synthladen arrangements rarely come off as bloated or banal, her work typically inspires less ridicule than, say, Yanni's". Gardner picked out [...] "China Roses" [...] as a track that reminded her of the [...] "tranquil radiance" [...] of [...] "Caribbean Blue" [...] from Shepherd Moons, with [...] "Once You Had Gold" [...] sounding [...] "equally tender, with a reassuring lyric and all the prettiness of a Christmas carol". She continued: [...] "Regardless of whether you understand Latin or Gaelic, the atmospheric warmth of [...] "Pax Deorum" [...] and [...] "Athair Ar Neamh" [...] will temporarily convince you that the world isn't such a terrible place after all". The album received a more critical review from Howard Cohen for The Los Angeles Daily News, saying it does not [...] "disappoint, at least not stylistically" [...] with its [...] "flawless" [...] recording and [...] "gorgeous" [...] sounds, but goes on to write, [...] "She stalls ... drowning in her formula. Two stars".|$|E

She said that the serial [...] "will really explore Darren and Nancy's relationship this year, and I can't wait to see how it all plays out". Nancy soon feels that she may be pregnant, Fox said that if Nancy were pregnant [...] "It would be great to watch them trying to cope with it", adding that the potential scenes would be [...] "hilarious". Nancy discovers she is pregnant and suffers a pregnancy scare. Fox told an Inside Soap reported that if Nancy suffered a miscarriage the couple's relationship may not survive. Her portrayer explained that Nancy begins to suffer stomach pains and blood loss but believes going to the hospital will solve the problem. Fox said that Nancy is in [...] "quite a lot of pain and is really frightened" [...] and she [...] "knows that there's a real possibility she could lose the baby, but that's too awful for her to contemplate". Nancy suffers a miscarriage which Fox said is a [...] "really traumatic time" [...] for both Nancy and Darren. She said that Nancy feels like she has [...] "failed, which is something she doesn't deal with very well". The actress added that the miscarraige will [...] "be a really difficult <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to ever get over". Fox {{revealed that}} the scenes took [...] "three or four weeks" [...] to film the [...] "quite intense" [...] material. She felt that the scripts for the scenes were [...] "some of the best scripts I've ever had. The way that it was written just felt really true, and it wasn't hard to conjure up that emotion". Speaking on This Morning, Fox said she was stopped in the street by people who praised the storyline as being true to life which she said was [...] "overwhelming". Dawson felt the storyline was being [...] "very true to life" [...] as the scenes are [...] "what people go through. It's nice that they're holding onto that and it doesn't just end there. It's an ongoing thing like any relationship, so it's just nice to do it justice. The feedback's been great".|$|E
