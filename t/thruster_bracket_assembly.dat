40|$|Random {{vibrations}} {{occur during}} the launch at the fastening interface between <b>thruster</b> <b>brackets</b> and basic support of satellite. These are {{generated in the}} launcher by the motion of some mechanical parts, combustion phenomena or structural elements excited by the acoustic environment. The goal of this comparative study {{is to find a}} simplified and efficient validation method using FEM PATRAN-NASTRAN software for <b>thruster</b> <b>brackets</b> in the random vibrations environment for space applications. The random vibration analysis requests complex pre/ post processing efforts and large hardware resources for various geometrical shapes. The PATRAN-NASTRAN random vibration analysis consists of frequency response analysis (111 solver) and Acceleration Spectral Density (ASD) diagram, taking into account the natural frequencies of the bracket. The Miles method computes the root mean square acceleration (aRMS) using the natural frequencies and the ASD diagram as input. As a conservative hypothesis in the random analysis, the three sigma standard deviation criteria in normal Gaussian distribution is applied at these RMS acceleration values, which means to multiply the aRMS by a load factor of three. Simplified method consists of using linear static PATRAN-NASTRAN analysis (101 solver) where the aRMS are introduced as loads. For validation of the simplified method, a comparative study was made between the random vibration and the linear static analysis. The final results are presented in detail in this article...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] A fixture is {{designed}} and built to hold, support and locate every component to ensure that each is drilled or machined with accuracy and manufactured individually. A fixture can be designed for a particular job. A brake spider includes a spider body with a central opening and a slot for receiving a camshaft and <b>bracket</b> <b>assembly.</b> The brake spider is attached to axle housing via the central opening. The form to be used depends on the shape and requirement of the work piece to be machined. In the existing fixture, used for modeling brake spider component, only five components were machined per hour. In the present work, detailed study of brake spider component is carried out and design is modified to increase the productivity. The new fixture design is carried out by using CATIA V 5 modeling software and it is critically evaluated {{for the failure of}} piston rod component, by finite element method (FEM) using ANSYS software.

40|$|Aircraft {{manufacturers}} are experiencing a fierce competition worldwide. Improving productivity, increasing throughput and reducing costs are influencing aircraft manufacturer’s future development. In {{order to improve}} competitiveness and provide sufficient and high quality products, it should reduce operations of aircraft assembly,majority of which are still in manual process, which limit production output. In contrast, these processes can be automated to replace manual operations. Much more attention {{should be placed on}} automated application. This project aims to propose a methodology to develop the automated assembly based on robotics and use this methodology to develop a new concept of Automated Leading Edge Assembly. The research selects an automated assembly process for further evaluation and brackets assembled on the front spar of Leading Edge are chosen to be automated assembly with robot assistant.

40|$|In {{this study}} the Discharge Chamber Model (DCM) simulates a 3 -cm {{diameter}} ring-cusp ion thruster {{to validate the}} model at miniature scales and reveal important aspects of small ion thruster performance and behavior. In general, DCM results agree well with miniature thruster data. Simulation of {{an early version of}} the Miniature Xenon Ion (MiXI) thruster show that over 50 % of the primary electrons are lost to the anode before having a collision with a propellant atom, thus revealing poor primary electron utilization in comparison with conventional NSTAR-size thrusters. Combining this observation with the discharge stability concerns at higher magnetic fields demonstrates that magnetic field optimization for a miniature ion <b>thruster</b> is <b>bracketed</b> by considerations of primary electron utilization and discharge stability. DCM results also show that the ionization in the thruster is almost entirely due to the primary electrons and that the secondary electron population attains relatively meager temperatures of only ~ 2 eV. Discharge plasma densities are near NSTAR values (~ 2 e 17 m- 3) while neutral atom densities are relatively high (~ 1 e 19 m- 3). The combination of these plasma parameters results in plasma characteristics (i. e., electron collision ratio and plasma magnetization) that are very {{similar to that of the}} NSTAR thruster. A design sensitivity analysis shows that DCM is sufficiently accurate to aid in the design and optimization of miniature thrusters...|$|R
40|$|In February 2011 the US Department of Energy {{announced}} their new Sunshot Initiative. The Sunshot {{goal is to}} reduce the total cost of solar energy systems by about 75 percent {{before the end of the}} decade. The DOE estimated that a total installed cost of $ 1 per watt for photovoltaic systems would be equivalent to 6 ÃÂÃÂ¢/kilowatt hour (kWh) for energy available from the grid. The DOE also estimated that to meet the $ 1 per watt goal, PV module costs would need to be reduced to $. 50 per watt, balance of systems costs would need to be reduced to $. 40 per watt, and power electronic costs would need to reach $. 10 per watt. To address the BOS balance of systems cost component of the $ 1 per watt goal, the DOE announced a funding opportunity called (BOS-X) Extreme Balance of System Hardware Cost Reductions. The DOE identified eight areas within the total BOS costs: 1) installation labor, 2) installation materials, 3) installation overhead and profit, 4) tracker, 5) permitting and commissioning, 6) site preparation, 7) land acquisition, 8) sales tax. The BOS-X funding announcement requested applications in four specific topics: Topic 1 : Transformational Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) Modules Topic 2 : Roof and Ground Mount Innovations Topic 3 : Transformational Photovoltaic System Designs Topic 4 : Development of New Wind Load Codes for PV Systems The application submitted by ARaymond Tinnerman reflected the requirements listed in Topic # 2, Roof and Ground Mount Innovations. The goal of topic # 2 was to develop technologies that would result in the extreme reduction of material and labor costs associated with applications that require physical connections and attachments to roof and ground mount structures.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{increased}} the viability of miniature ion thruster technology, advanced state-of-the-art discharge modeling, and revealed important aspects of discharge plasma processes. These extensions of existing ion thruster technology and understanding are necessary to fulfill the needs of future space missions. Experimental comparisons of the discharge performance of an array of miniature (3 cm diameter) ion thruster discharge configurations were conducted and showed that a 3 -ring configuration with length-to-diameter of 1. 0 exhibited the best performance. A compact and lightweight version of this configuration, using small accelerator grid holes, exhibited discharge losses of 250 - 550 eV/ion and propellant efficiency {{of as much as}} 87 %. This performance represents a significant advancement in miniature (less than 5 cm diameter) ion thruster technology and demonstrates that a miniature ion thruster of low magnet and thruster weight can yield desirable performance. A multi-component hybrid 2 -D computational Discharge Model was developed to help identify important ion thruster discharge processes and investigate miniaturization issues. Combining experimental and computational results reveals that magnetic field optimization for a miniature ion <b>thruster</b> is <b>bracketed</b> by considerations of primary electron utilization and discharge stability. Discharge Model analysis of the larger (30 cm diameter) NSTAR thruster revealed that the peak observed in the NSTAR beam profile is due to double ions that are created by over-confinement of primary electrons on the thruster axis. Design sensitivity results show that, at the NSTAR thruster scale, efficient confinement of primary electrons is relatively easy to achieve; therefore, efforts to improve thruster performance should focus on effectively utilizing the primary electrons to minimize double ion production and maximize the number of single ions extracted to the beam. The observations from this study have furthered the understanding of discharge processes and should improve future ion thruster design and modeling efforts. The Discharge Model advances state-of-the-art ion thruster modeling and provides a framework for a complete thruster model {{that can be used for}} long-life performance assessment and life validation...|$|R

30|$|The {{ligation}} between bracket {{and wire}} is another variable that influences the frictional force [24]. In the present study, the ligation method between the bracket and wire was standardized to eliminate this variable. However, large {{variation in the}} obtained data that was observed in this study {{could be due to}} the small sample size and employed test methodology. In addition, the minimal impact of chlorhexidine mouthrinse on the surface roughness or frictional resistance observed in this study might be due to the short-period immersion (1.5  h) of the stainless steel <b>brackets</b> and archwire <b>assemblies</b> in each test environment. The immersion period was chosen because chlorhexidine mouthrinses are usually prescribed for a short-term only between 4 to 12  weeks twice a day due to their adverse effects on tooth color and normal flora in the mouth. Chlorhexidine molecules would attach to the oral tissues and release gradually. Defining chlorhexidine concentration in the mouth after 30  s after expectoration is difficult. Thus, the 1.5 -hchlorhexidine exposure in this study attempted to simulate 3 -month accumulation of 1 -min daily chlorhexidine mouthrinse applications. As with any in vitro study, the protocol cannot exactly simulate the real clinical situation.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{relationship}} between the critical contact angle and the torque angle in an orthodontic <b>bracket</b> and archwire <b>assembly</b> in 3 dimensions. Three-dimensional mathematical models were created with geometric bracket-archwire parameters that included 2 slot sizes, 3 bracket widths, and 3 to 4 wire sizes. From this, 3 -dimensional mathematical equations (3 DMEs) for the critical contact angle and the maximum torque that result in critical contact angles of 0 were derived and calculated. To evaluate the effects of archwire-bracket parameters on critical contact angles, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed at the significance level of P. 05. For all bracket-archwire combinations, the critical contact angle decreased as bracket width, torque angle, and wire size increased. Therefore, all bracket-archwire parameters except slot height had an effect on the critical contact angle. Results of the critical contact angle produced from our 3 DMEs were the same as those produced by 3 D computer-aided design (SolidWorks Corp, Concord, Mass), thus confirming the validity of our derived equations. In addition, the effect of a beveled edge was investigated in some archwires. Furthermore, torsional play angles were calculated and found to be similar to those in previous reports. The results of this study provide theoretic and experimental bases for clinical orthodontic practice and indicate that torque angles should be included in the evaluation of the critical contact angle.
