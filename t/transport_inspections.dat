40|$|The {{inception}} of microfluidics, utilising borrowed technology from the microelectronics industry, has enabled {{a wide range}} of applications in various fields ranging from engineering to biochemistry. Advancements in terms of microfabrication and micro-scale fluid control has led to the rise of Lab on a Chip. These systems aim to replicate the results of conventional laboratory procedures in miniaturised systems. Lab on a Chip systems, offer immense potential for {{a wide range of}} diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Furthermore, when sample volumes are extremely scarce, rendering conventional diagnostic methods and continuous flow micro fluidic techniques impractical, other methods need to be established. To this end, microfluidic batch process systems offers a solution, although relatively underdeveloped. Batch process systems are a single or multi-stage process in which a certain quantity of inputs are processed to achieve the desired outcome one sample set at a time. It should be noted, as these systems operate at a much smaller scale, some conventional forcing techniques, such as centrifugation are no longer practical. Therefore, different actuation mechanisms need to be developed to replicate the results of their larger scale conventional laboratory and continuous flow counterparts. Acoustic excitation is a potential actuation mechanism which enables the handling of micron-sized particles and cells. Here, we look at different acoustic excitation methods and the underlying principles that allow acoustofluidic systems to manipulate particles for sample preparation and as point- of-care diagnostic tools. In this thesis, three systems are developed to perform particle manipulation both in liquid and air based batch process systems. Firstly, an open bulk acoustic wave system, allowing the ease of external gripping mechanisms is developed to perform size-deterministic separation of 3 μm and 10 μm particles. The task of particle separation is further explored using a different underlying principle and actuation method, and separation of 3. 1 μm and 5. 1 μm is achieved utilising surface acoustic waves, a different excitation mechanism that enables operation at relatively higher frequencies. Finally, optimisation of an acoustic resonator in air is carried out and serves as a building block for a complete 3 -dimensional (3 D) acoustic trapping microgripper to be used for individualised particle <b>transport</b> and <b>inspection.</b> Throughout this thesis, a case is made for acoustic based methods to be utilised in developing essential batch process systems for sample preparation and diagnostics...|$|R
40|$|Adenoviruses (Ads) are nonenveloped viruses which {{replicate}} and assemble in the nucleus. Therefore, {{viral membrane}} proteins {{are not directly}} required for their multiplication. Yet, all human Ads encode integral membrane proteins in the early transcription unit 3 (E 3). Previous studies on subgenus C Ads demonstrated that most E 3 proteins exhibit immunomodulatory functions. In this review {{we focus on the}} E 3 membrane proteins, which appear to be primarily devoted to remove critical recognition structures for the host immune system from the cell surface. The molecular mechanism for removal depends on the E 3 protein involved: E 3 / 19 K prevents expression of newly synthesized MHC molecules by inhibition of ER export, whereas E 3 / 10. 4 - 14. 5 K down-regulate apoptosis receptors by rerouting them into lysosomes. The viral proteins mediating these processes contain typical transport motifs, such as KKXX, YXXPhi, or LL. E 3 / 49 K, another recently discovered E 3 protein, may require such motifs to reach a processing compartment essential for its presumed immunomodulatory activity. Thus, E 3 membrane proteins exploit the intracellular trafficking machinery for immune evasion. Conspicuously, many E 3 membrane proteins from Ads other than subgenus C also contain putative <b>transport</b> motifs. Close <b>inspection</b> of surrounding amino acids suggests that many of these are likely to be functional. Therefore, Ads might harbor more E 3 proteins that exploit intracellular trafficking pathways as a means to manipulate immunologically important key molecules. Differential expression of such functions by Ads of different subgenera may contribute to their differential pathogenesis. Thus, an unexpected link emerges between viral manipulation of intracellular transport pathways and immune evasion...|$|R

The purpose of this investigation is to explore the {{different ways in which}} we can improve the inspection of “Placards & Markings” for Nextjet’s SAAB- 340 aircrafts. This assesment is required by the government in the process of renewing/extending the ARC-airworthiness Review Certificate of the planes. The ARC-process is conducted according to the rules and regulations of the EASA, one of which is a review of the plane’s airworthiness. In this thesis we will explore the plausible ways of inspection while compa- ring and contrasting these different methods. The intent is to find the most adequate and reliable procedure at the lowest cost, with high security. We will focus on three chosen methods: • Visual inspection • ITS - intelligent <b>transport</b> system • <b>Inspection</b> of the aircrafts exterior {{with the help of a}} drone New technologies like ITS and drones are on the rampage and has many advantages.

Visual inspection is an inexpensive alternative that requires no sophisticated equip- ment. A technical instruction must, according to the studied literature, have a structured format. Consideration should be given to the human factors that come into play during a visual inspection, which can be prevented if kept in mind when designing the instruction. The technical instruction that we designed needs to be tested in its real environment to properly evaluate its function. ...|$|R

The small scale segment is a manifestation of India’s socio-economic development model and has met with the country’s long term expectations in terms of contribution to GDP, industrial base, employment and exports. This segment forms a major part of Indian industrial base. Small scale industries contribute about 10 % of total GDP. The small scale industries are supported by the government and financial institutions like MSME,TIIC, SBI etc. in terms of technical and financial assistance. Even then MSE’s are lagging in infrastructure, skilled labour. In order to analyse the various menace factors in SSI, the survey was conducted in 20 small scale industries who are supplying their product to many Tier 1 companies and leading automobile companies (OEM) in India. Lean philosophy of manufacturing focuses on waste reduction. Lean identifies some wastes namely over production, equipment breakdown, material shortages, yield loss, rework and scrap, non-optimal performance, changeover, material <b>transport,</b> material storage, <b>inspection,</b> delays, walking, idle time or waiting and excess inventory.

40|$|As {{the domains}} touched by {{economic}} liberalisation and competitivity grows, the {{marketing and distribution}} of agro-food products is becoming a sizeable issue for certain ACP countries. These countries need to become full players in global commercial networks, and {{to have access to}} international markets. Spain {{is one of the leading}} countries in the marketing of perishable agro-food products. In April 1998, CTA joined forces with the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to organise a seminar with the primary goal of analysing this sector in the European context, and as it applies to the various situations in the represented ACP States. The seminar brought together professionals from the fish, fruit and vegetable sectors of Spanish-speaking countries (Equatorial Guinea and the Dominican Republic), Portuguese-speaking countries (Angola, Guinea Bissau and Mozambique) and French-speaking countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Mauritania and Senegal). Trade in these products between the European Union (EU) and the aforementioned countries is of considerable importance. Each country sent two representatives, one from the public sector and another from the independent sector; thus, there were present private operators and members of Chambers of Commerce, public bodies and producer associations. The programme was divided into plenary sessions, field visits and working groups, and covered all phases of the perishability cycle from production to the end of the distribution chain. The field visits served to illustrate points raised in plenary sessions: production centres, wholesale markets (the wholesale market of Madrid, Mercamadrid, is the leading world market in fish, at least in terms of variety), large shopping malls and hypermarkets, and street sale points. Other aspects covered included: norms and classification (of the EU), quality control and <b>inspection,</b> <b>transport</b> problems and promotion campaigns. The working groups analysed the situation in their countries in terms of production, transport and marketing for each sector. The principal recommendations by participants pointed to the need to achieve better control of production and marketing by means of improved technical and commercial training, access to finance and credit, seeking out non-traditional markets and joint ventures, diversification of outlets and distribution circuits, the development of transport infrastructures at the national and regional levels, and the development of storage and handling facilities and equipment. A major constraint was seen in the lack of information and statistical data. Further reading: The promotion of fruit and vegetable production in the ACP countries for export to the EEC countries.

40|$|What are {{the core}} {{activities}} of the FSC? The FSC is an international non-profit organization that was founded in 1993 to introduce an international forest certification scheme and {{to act as an}} accreditation body. Forest certification is the process of inspecting particular forests or woodland to see if they are being managed according to an agreed set of strict ecological, economic and social criteria or standards. The FSC does not itself certify forest operations or manufacturers. These important activities are carried out by independent, FSC-accredited certification bodies in more than 30 countries. An important component of forest certification is product or chain-of-custody (CoC) verification. CoC is the process through which the source of a timber product is verified. In order to qualify for the FSC trademark, timber products must be traceable from the forest through all the steps in the production process until they reach the end user. The FSC provides producers with international labelling standards to facilitate this process. Over the past few decades, CoC labelling processes have greatly benefited from ICTs. How have CoC methods evolved? The oldest methods of wood labelling involved painting or chiselling company information and ID numbers onto a tree, or on one or both ends of a log. Such labels are commonly used in conjunction with paper records on tree or log species, dimensions and volume. More recently, ICTs are providing increasingly sophisticated means of labelling, as well as more efficient tools for tracking and storing additional information about timber products. The first major technological leap was the bar-coded label. Bar-coded data can be instantly read by a handheld scanner, stored electronically and transferred to a computer for analyses of stock inventories, for example. Bar-coded labels are increasingly being used to identify individual logs, particularly in countries that export high-value logs, and it is important to capture export revenues. Another key development has been the emergence of labels containing radio frequency identification (RFID) transceivers that receive and transmit data by radio signals. A handheld scanner can instruct any RFID label to transmit its data through a coded signal. The scanner may then be plugged into a computer and the data downloaded for further analysis. An important advantage of RFID systems for log tracking is that the data signals can be read rapidly, remotely and under difficult conditions. Also, RFID labels can store a large amount of data {{with a high level of}} security - they are difficult to counterfeit or tamper with. The tags come in a variety of forms, including plastic cards and tiny injectable transponders. On the down side, available radio frequencies vary from country to country, so there are currently no internationally standardized RFID technologies. What´s more, RFID labels are still too expensive for labelling individual logs and processed bundles of wood. What advanced technologies are now being used to capture data? CoC systems require careful documentation and record keeping, including files related to stock inventories and <b>inspections,</b> <b>transport</b> documentation, and retail and distribution records. The forestry industry has developed extensive databases to manage these records more effectively. Also, Global Positioning System (GPS) technology has had a major impact on this aspect of the CoC. GPS is commonly used in forest inventories to delineate the boundaries of forested areas and to determine field locations, but can also be used to track shipments of logs and timber products and to provide estimated delivery times. Microchip cards, or ´smart cards´, and magnetic strip cards are also very useful. These pieces of plastic can store large amounts of data and have built-in security features - they are ideal replacements for paper records and make the logistics of tracking timber products much more efficient. Finally, how is the FSC using ICTs to disseminate information? As an international network, the FSC relies on electronic communication to reach its 500 members and 33 national offices, in addition to annual face-to-face meetings. The FSC provides information in both Spanish and English to reach its stakeholders in the South, and has recently launched a new website and intranet. All relevant new developments are announced in the monthly FSC email newsletter News+Notes, which is sent to more than 4000 subscribers around the world. Moreover, the FSC has set up a hotline to answer questions, and has created a number of web-based forums so that stakeholders can more easily exchange information regarding the Council´s policies, consultations and other issues related to forest management. Taken together, these initiatives form part of a concerted, ongoing effort on the part of the FSC to increase awareness of the many benefits of forest certification - now and in the future. mailto:andra@fscoax. org Zandra Martinez is FSC media officer.
