5|$|In January 1908, {{newspaper}} reports held that Shay {{would not return}} to the Giants and that McGraw would meet with him to begin arranging a trade <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>send</b> him to another team. That year he played for the Stockton Millers of the California League, an independent minor league. Stockton won the 1908 league championship. During the 1909 season, he became a player-manager for the Kansas City Blues of the American Association.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Liz Lemon (Fey) {{meets the}} man of her dreams (Damon). Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) love {{triangle}} with Avery Jessup (Banks) and Nancy Donovan (Moore) comes to a head. At the same time, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) tries to avoid a promotion <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>send</b> him to Los Angeles, and Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) new relationship may be ruined after her boyfriend (Forte) falls for another woman.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to build up their lineup, the Red Sox set up a {{potential}} deal <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>send</b> reigning AL MVP Alex Rodriguez to Boston and Red Sox Manny Ramírez and other players to Texas. The deal eventually fell through after Rodríguez indicated he would not go against the MLBPA, which opposes a proposed renegotiation, which would have potentially reduced Rodríguez's earnings in the later years of his contract. A freak off-season basketball injury to Aaron Boone just several months removed from his historic home run had Yankees management looking at possible options to replace him. Despite being courted by Boston for nearly three months, Rodríguez was traded from Texas to New York.|$|E

5|$|In giving {{attention}} to national affairs, McKinley neglected his home front in Ohio, {{and when the}} Republican state convention met in Zanesville in May 1895, {{it proved to be}} controlled by the resurgent Foraker, who sought the Senate seat to be filled by the Ohio General Assembly in January 1896. That convention endorsed McKinley for president and Foraker for Senate, and nominated Foraker supporters for state and party offices, including Asa Bushnell to succeed McKinley as governor. McKinley realized that it would be risky to have a faction hostile to the presidential candidate within his home state, and sought an alliance, campaigning for Bushnell and for a Republican legislature <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>send</b> Foraker to Washington. The voters chose Bushnell and gave the state Republicans a large majority in the legislature. In January 1896, Foraker was overwhelmingly elected (to take office in March 1897), and McKinley gained Foraker's agreement to support him for president, assuring party political peace at home.|$|E
5|$|On February 7, 2015, Davis {{injured his}} {{shoulder}} after {{falling off the}} rim when he received an alley-oop. As {{a result of the}} injury, he withdrew from the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, and was replaced on the roster by Dirk Nowitzki and in the starting lineup by LaMarcus Aldridge. Davis missed five games in late February and early March to the shoulder sprain. He returned against the Detroit Pistons with a very dominant game performance of 39 points, 13 rebounds, and 8 blocks, numbers that only Hakeem Olajuwon and Dwight Howard had achieved in a game in the prior 30 years. Davis also reached 437 career blocks, a franchise record. On March 9, Davis tied his career high with 43 points and added 10 rebounds, 2 blocks and a steal in a 114-103 win against the Milwaukee Bucks. On March 15 in a double overtime game against the Denver Nuggets, Davis became the first player in NBA history to tally 36 points, 14 rebounds, 9 blocks and 7 assists in a game since blocks became a statistic in 1973. Only David Robinson has had at least 30 points, 11 rebounds, 8 blocks and 7 assists in a game. On March 16, Davis earned Western Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, March 9, through Sunday, March 15 and was a finalist for Western Conference Player of the Month of March. In the final game of the regular season, a must-win game <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>send</b> the Pelicans to the 2015 NBA Playoffs, Davis recorded 31 points, 13 rebounds, and 3 blocks in a 108-103 victory over the defending-champion San Antonio Spurs. The playoff berth was Davis' first and the franchise's first since 2011. Davis' season {{was one of the most}} impressive in NBA history, finishing the season averaging 24.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 2.9 blocks, and leading the league in player efficiency rating with 30.89. He was a finalist for Western Conference Player of the Month again in April.|$|E
5|$|The quarter-final draw also {{determined}} the teams' routes to the final, with Barcelona facing {{the prospect of}} meeting either Chelsea or Liverpool in the semi-finals. After a 3–1 win at Anfield, Chelsea qualified for the semi-finals with a 4–4 draw at Stamford Bridge. The semi-final first leg was played at the Camp Nou; although Barcelona enjoyed {{the majority of the}} possession, Chelsea's defence was resolute and they became the first side to keep a clean sheet in Barcelona in this season's competition, coming away with a goalless draw. Barcelona needed to avoid defeat to reach the final, but they found themselves a goal down within 10 minutes; after they failed to clear Frank Lampard's pass into the penalty area, Michael Essien fired a left-footed volley past Víctor Valdés into the roof of the net. The rest of the match continued much the same as the first leg, with Barcelona retaining most of the possession. Despite this, they found themselves guilty of several fouls, while Chelsea made four unsuccessful penalty appeals during the match. Meanwhile, Dani Alves received his third yellow card of the knockout phase, ruling him out of Barcelona's next match, and Éric Abidal was given a straight red card for a foul on Nicolas Anelka as the French forward was through on goal. However, television replays after the incident showed that there was little contact between Abidal and Anelka. Norwegian referee Tom Henning Øvrebø allowed a minimum of fourminutes of injury time {{at the end of the}} second half; in the third of those fourminutes – just when it looked like Chelsea were about to secure a repeat of the 2008 final – Messi played the ball across the edge of the penalty area to Andrés Iniesta, who shot just past Petr Čech's outstretched hand for the away goal <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>send</b> Barcelona to the final.|$|E

25|$|By 1967, {{overcrowding}} {{became an}} issue at Wheaton Central. In late 1967, the school board proposed a redistricting move <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>send</b> all Warrenville students to the newer Wheaton North building. In January 1968, the board approved bussing underclass students in Warrenville to Wheaton North, and allowing upperclassmen the choice of either school.|$|E
25|$|The fort {{commands}} the rail {{crossing of the}} Rhine. The tracks at the Swiss end of the bridge featured a turnout <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>send</b> an enemy armored train off the tracks and down an embankment, to be fired upon by the machine gun in Block 4. On 14 May 1940 a false alarm caused the switch to be activated, nearly derailing an innocent coal train.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, Walker complained with Cowboys {{management}} {{that he was}} being moved around between three different positions (running back, fullback, wide receiver) and that Dorsett had more carries. He would take over as the team's main running back, playing in 12 games (11 starts), while registering 891 rushing yards, 715 receiving yards, and 8 touchdowns. Dorsett played in 12 games (6 starts) and had two healthy DNP (Did Not Play), which would make him demand a trade <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>send</b> him to the Denver Broncos.|$|E

25|$|British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin heard Marshall's radio {{broadcast}} speech and immediately contacted French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault to begin preparing a quick European response to (and acceptance of) the offer, {{which led to}} the creation of the Committee of European Economic Co-operation. The two agreed that it would be necessary to invite the Soviets as the other major allied power. Marshall's speech had explicitly included an invitation to the Soviets, feeling that excluding them would have been a sign of distrust. State Department officials, however, knew that Stalin would almost certainly not participate, and that any plan <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>send</b> large amounts of aid to the Soviets was unlikely to be approved by Congress.|$|E
25|$|Before the 2011–12 NBA season, the Hornets were {{considering}} trade offers for Chris Paul. Paul eventually requested a trade to the New York Knicks. The Hornets looked at many teams, including the Boston Celtics and the Golden State Warriors as trade partners, but Paul {{had made it}} clear he wanted to be traded to New York or Los Angeles. A three-team trade involving the Los Angeles Lakers and the Houston Rockets was agreed upon, but commissioner David Stern vetoed the trade. On December 14, 2011, the Hornets agreed to a deal with the Los Angeles Clippers <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>send</b> Paul to L.A. in exchange for Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and a first-round draft pick acquired by the Clippers from a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2004.|$|E
25|$|The model rocket kits were {{a modest}} success and MITS {{wanted to try}} a kit that would appeal to more hobbyists. The November 1970 issue of Popular Electronics {{featured}} the Opticom, a kit from MITS <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>send</b> voice over an LED light beam. Mims and Cagle were losing interest in the kit business so Roberts bought his partners out, then began developing a calculator kit. Electronic Arrays had just announced a set of six LSI integrated circuit chips {{that would make a}} four-function calculator. The MITS 816 calculator kit used the chip set and was featured on the November 1971 cover of Popular Electronics. This calculator kit sold for $175 ($275 assembled). Forrest Mims wrote the assembly manual for this kit and many others over the next several years. He often accepted a copy of the kit as payment.|$|E

25|$|In {{a single}} town, between 2,000 and 5,000 {{people were killed}} {{overnight}} after a massive flood inundated the area. Fifi brought continuous rainfall to the area for three days, hampering relief efforts in what was the worst disaster in Honduras' history at the time. In nearby Guatemala, an additional 200 people were killed by severe flooding, making Fifi the worst hurricane to impact the country in nearly 20 years. Following the catastrophic damage wrought by the storm, relief agencies {{from around the world}} flew in emergency supplies to assist {{the hundreds of thousands of}} homeless people. Countries closer to Honduras, such as the United States, set up city donation centers <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>send</b> supplies to the country. In efforts to prevent the spread of post-storm diseases, the government allowed the burning of bodies as they were recovered. In a single day, up to 6,000 bodies were burned. Due to the extreme damage and loss of life, the name was retired from the list of Atlantic hurricane names and has not been used since.|$|E
500|$|In November 2008, De Vries aired {{undercover}} {{footage of}} Van der Sloot making {{preparations for the}} apparent sex trafficking of Thai women in Bangkok. De Vries claimed that Van der Sloot was making $13,000 for every woman sold into prostitution in the Netherlands. Van der Sloot used the alias [...] "Murphy Jenkins" [...] to avoid Thai authorities. Peruvian Minister of Justice Aurelio Pastor said that Thailand was pursuing criminal charges against Van der Sloot.

500|$|Two nights after San Diego Padres {{management}} informed Nevin that Xavier Nady {{would replace}} {{him as the}} starting first baseman, Nevin rejected a trade to the Baltimore Orioles for Sidney Ponson on July 25, 2005. Nevin exercised a clause in his contract that gave him the right to block transactions <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>send</b> him to any of eight franchises, {{one of which was}} the Orioles. He was instead traded on July 30, a day before the non-waiver trade deadline, to the Texas Rangers for Chan Ho Park, whose salary the Rangers wanted to dump. In his first thirteen games with the Rangers, the team posted a 1–12 record as Nevin batted 5-for-44. That put his season batting average under [...]200, known as the [...] "Mendoza Line". The Rangers benched Nevin in September, giving his starts to prospect first baseman Adrian Gonzalez after the team was eliminated from playoff contention. In his first game back in the lineup on September 24, his average dropped to [...]182. He refuted opinions that he was losing bat speed.|$|E

The trade was made official on July 11, 2012, the first day the trade moratorium was lifted. On August 10, 2012, in a four-team trade the Lakers traded Andrew Bynum and acquired Dwight Howard. On November 9, 2012, Mike Brown was relieved of coaching duties after a 1–4 start to the 2012–13 season. [...] Assistant Coach Bernie Bickerstaff took over as interim head coach, leading the Lakers to a 5–5 record. [...] On November 12, 2012, the Lakers hired Mike D'Antoni as head coach. [...] On February 18, 2013, Lakers owner Jerry Buss died from cancer at age 80. On the court, D'Antoni coached the Lakers to a 40–32 record {{the rest of the way}} to finish 45–37, their worst record since 2007. The Lakers clinched a playoff berth on the final game of the season and finished seventh in the Western Conference after beating the Houston Rockets on April 16, 2013. The Lakers battled injuries all season, the most prominent of which is the Achilles tendon rupture to Kobe Bryant that ended his season after 78 games. The absence of Bryant was sorely felt as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2013 NBA Playoffs. [...] Nevertheless, Bryant passed Lakers legend Wilt Chamberlain to become the fourth all-time leading scorer in NBA history on March 30, 2013, against the Sacramento Kings.|$|E
