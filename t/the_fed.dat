5|$|After a two-years {{break in}} <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> Cup, Kuznetsova participated at the 2015 Fed Cup, where team Russia played against Poland in the Round Robin. With her win over Agnieszka Radwańska in three sets, Kuznetsova beat a top-10 player in <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> Cup {{for the first}} time. In the semifinals against Germany she played two rubbers, one was won against Julia Görges, another against Andrea Petkovic. With her win over Görges, Kuznetsova became the second-best Russian Fed Cup player by total wins, with 27 won rubbers; the {{absolute}} leader is Larisa Savchenko, with 40 won rubbers. Kuznetsova was not called in the final.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is twofold. First, we {{characterize}} <b>the</b> <b>Fed’s</b> systematic response to technology shocks and its implications for U. S. output, hours and inflation. Second, we evaluate the extent to which those responses can be accounted for by a simple monetary policy rule (including the optimal one) {{in the context of a}} standard business cycle model with sticky prices. Our main results can be described as follows: First, we detect significant differences across periods in the response of the economy (as well as <b>the</b> <b>Fed’s)</b> to a technology shock. Second, <b>the</b> <b>Fed’s</b> response to a technology shock in the Volcker– Greenspan period is consistent with an optimal monetary policy rule. Third, in the Pre-Volcker period <b>the</b> <b>Fed’s</b> policy tended to overstabilize output at the cost of generating excessive inflation volatility.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} tests of the expectations hypothesis is Mankiw and Miron (1986), who found that the spread between the long-term and short-term rates provided predictive power for the short-term rate before <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> founding but not after. They suggested that the failure of the expectations hypothesis after <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> founding was due to <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> practice of smoothing short-term interest rates. We show that their finding that the expectations hypothesis fares better prior to <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> founding {{is due to the fact}} that the test they employ tends to generate results that are more favorable to the expectations hypothesis during periods when there is extreme volatility in the short-term rate.

5|$|Among {{the issues}} that the Mint Bureau had to face in 1933 and 1934 was the calling-in of most gold coins. When the Treasury Department issued {{regulations}} allowing such coins to be surrendered at branches of the Federal Reserve Bank, O'Reilly sent out a memorandum over her signature as acting director noting that <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> had no facilities to accept any gold other than bars with a government stamp. At the time, the Mint Bureau {{was one of the}} lowest-status branches of the Department of the Treasury, esteemed far less than the Secret Service and other law enforcement-related agencies that fell under the Treasury Secretary. Burdette points out that the gold regulations showed a lack of basic Mint knowledge both by Roosevelt's appointees and the holdover senior officials from the Hoover administration.|$|E
5|$|Kuznetsova {{joined the}} Russian team in 2011. In {{the first round}} they faced France on 5 and 6 February.

Russia became just the fourth nation {{to come back from}} 0–2 down in a Fed Cup tie since the best-of-five-match format was introduced to the World Group in 1995. Russia defeated Italy in the semifinal in 5–0. There, Svetlana Kuznetsova defeated Roberta Vinci. Russia succeeded, the first time since 2008, in a final in <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> Cup.

25|$|Aguirre {{is helping}} Senator Grassley's staff examine 21,000 Federal Reserve (<b>the</b> <b>Fed)</b> {{transactions}} involving taxpayer funds distributed to {{banks and other}} financial institutions. <b>The</b> <b>Fed</b> was forced to reveal the information by Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by Bloomberg News and Fox News, as well as provisions contained in Wall Street reform legislation. Despite pronouncements by <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> about its transparency, the information released has been incomplete. The lack of details {{make it impossible to}} tell just how much profit the recipients of the funds are making and only the recipients' names and amount of funds are known. Aguirre says that between $3 and $4 trillion in cash transfers were made and another $9 to $11 trillion in commitments that taxpayer funds would cover the cost of failed investments. “It looks like they are borrowing the money from <b>the</b> <b>Fed,</b> say, at 70 cents on the dollar and selling it back to <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> for 90 cents.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the history of}} Federal Reserve Bank input into Federal Reserve System monetary policymaking. From <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> founding in 1914 through the Great Depression, the Reserve Banks held the balance of power. Dissatisfaction with <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> performance, however, led to a wholesale reorganization in 1935 that greatly enhanced {{the authority of the}} Federal Reserve Board, but retained a role for the Federal Banks through the membership of their presidents on the FOMC, as well as in setting the discount rate. I argue that <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> decentralized structure was not the principal cause of Fed errors during the Great Depression. In addition, by retaining a role for the Federal Reserve Banks, <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> present structure provides the System with a measure of political independence and encourages a competition of ideas within the System that enhances the quality of policymaking.

25|$|To smooth {{temporary}} or cyclical {{changes in}} the money supply, the desk engages in repurchase agreements (repos) with its primary dealers. Repos are essentially secured, short-term lending by <b>the</b> <b>Fed.</b> On {{the day of the}} transaction, <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> deposits money in a primary dealer's reserve account, and receives the promised securities as collateral. When the transaction matures, the process unwinds: <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> returns the collateral and charges the primary dealer's reserve account for the principal and accrued interest. The term of the repo (the time between settlement and maturity) can vary from 1 day (called an overnight repo) to 65 days.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Reserve System {{implements}} {{monetary policy}} largely by targeting {{the federal funds}} rate. This is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds, which are the reserves held by banks at <b>the</b> <b>Fed.</b> This rate is actually determined by the market and is not explicitly mandated by <b>the</b> <b>Fed.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Fed</b> therefore tries to align the effective federal funds rate with the targeted rate by adding or subtracting from the money supply through open market operations. The Federal Reserve System usually adjusts the federal funds rate target by 0.25% or 0.50% at a time.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fed's</b> {{credibility}} regarding {{control of}} inflation helps to anchor public expectations of price stability. This makes <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> actions more predictable in any given set of circumstances and thus strengthens the {{monetary policy transmission mechanism}} and shortens policy lags. The importance of <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> credibility can be illustrated by the consequences of its absence in the 1970 s. This paper discusses the roots of <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> current credibility: a systematic approach to controlling inflation, transparency of its policy decisions, and timely communication of the decisions and the considerations upon which they are based. The paper also discusses areas in which there is room for further improvement. It argues that the most important future step would be to adopt specific inflation targets. Such a step would not only enhance credibility, it would help to focus policy-making itself. While there are some risks to establishing specific numerical targets, these risks can be managed and are outweighed by the benefits of explicit targets.

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether tightening and easing {{actions of the}} Federal Reserve symmetrically influence currency markets. Using daily data on four exchange rates from 1989 to 2001, we find that changes in <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> interest rate target are positively related {{to changes in the}} value of the dollar. Surprises associated with monetary tightening have a larger announcement effect as compared to monetary easing for the British pound, German mark, and Canadian dollar, whereas the opposite is true for the Japanese yen. The results appear to be driven by the reactions of foreign central banks to Fed actions, <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> credibility as a policymaker, and by the change in <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> disclosure policy beginning in 1994.
