50|$|Bomba is {{described}} to be a challenge/connection between the drummer and <b>the</b> <b>dancer.</b> <b>The</b> <b>dancer</b> produces {{a series of}} gestures to which the primo o subidor drummer provides a synchronized beat. Thus, it is the drummer who attempts to follow <b>the</b> <b>dancer,</b> and not <b>the</b> more traditional form of <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> following <b>the</b> drummer. <b>The</b> <b>dancer</b> must be in great physical shape, and the challenge usually continues until either <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> or <b>the</b> drummer discontinues.|$|R
5000|$|Kundera {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> early in <b>the</b> book. <b>The</b> <b>dancer,</b> defined in <b>the</b> story, {{is a person who}} constantly seeks the infinite and invisible audience that modern media offers.

5|$|Kong's New York stage {{appearance}} {{looks very}} much like a re-enactment of the 1933 film's sacrifice scene, including the posts the 'beauty' is tied to and the nearly identical performance and costumes of <b>the</b> <b>dancers.</b> In addition, the music played by the orchestra during that scene is Max Steiner's original score for the 1933 film.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} {{four members of}} the nobility was {{sufficiently}} important to ensure that the event was recorded in contemporary chronicles, most notably by Froissart and the Monk of St Denis, and subsequently illustrated in a number of copies of illuminated manuscripts. While the two main chroniclers agree on essential points of the evening—the dancers were dressed as wild men, the King survived, one man fell into a vat, and four of <b>the</b> <b>dancers</b> died—there are discrepancies in the details. Froissart wrote that <b>the</b> <b>dancers</b> were chained together, which is not mentioned in the monk's account. Furthermore, the two chroniclers are at odds regarding the purpose of the dance. According to the historian Susan Crane, the monk describes the event as a wild charivari with the audience participating in the dance, whereas Froissart's description suggests a theatrical performance without audience participation.|$|E
50|$|Kiribati dancing can be {{categorized}} into eight main styles.

As the sieve reaches the top point of the circle (above <b>the</b> <b>dancer's</b> head) <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> begins to lower his main hand to complete the circle. Once the circle is almost complete <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> begins to folding his angle and twist his wrist inwards his body, continuing the circle movement.

40|$|For a Digital Performing Agent {{to be able}} {{to perform}} live with a human dancer, it would be useful for the agent {{to be able to}} contextualize <b>the</b> {{movement}} <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> is performing and to have a suitable movement vocabulary with which to contribute to the performance. In this paper we will discuss our research into the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as a means of allowing a software agent to learn a shared vocabulary of movement from a <b>dancer.</b> <b>The</b> agent is able to use the learnt movements to form an internal representation of what <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> is performing, allowing it to follow <b>the</b> <b>dancer,</b> generate movement sequences based on <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s current movement and dance independently of <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> using a shared movement vocabulary. By combining the ANN with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) the agent is able to recognize short full body movement phrases and respond when <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> performs these phrases. We consider the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> and agent as a means of supporting the agent 2 ̆ 7 s learning and performance, rather than developing the agent 2 ̆ 7 s capability in a self-contained fashion...|$|R
5000|$|Costume colors {{may be used}} {{to enhance}} body line and form, and they may be chosen to {{complement}} <b>the</b> <b>dancer's</b> body shape or skin color. Darker colors can make <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> appear slimmer, whereas lighter colors tend to make <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> appear larger. Loud prints or bold color combinations are often avoided as they can distort the body lines and, in the case of tights, tend to make <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> look larger. [...] Also, strong, intense colors may tire the eyes. Color transitions are often implemented using gradients, as sharp color contrasts tend to visually chop the body into sections.|$|R
40|$|Emergence by John McCormick, Steph Hutchison and an {{emerging}} performing agent, is a duet performed between a human dancer and an artificially intelligent performing agent. The agent has learnt to dance through a rehearsal process with <b>the</b> <b>dancer,</b> sharing <b>the</b> <b>dancer’s</b> movement and style. Emergence sees <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> and agent co-creating an interactive semi-improvised dance performance. Visualisations {{of their relationship}} are projected in glorious Stereoscopic 3 D. The neural network based agent uses a motion capture system as its sensory input for understanding <b>the</b> <b>dancer’s</b> movement.

5|$|The Bal des Ardents (Ball of the Burning Men) or Bal des Sauvages (Ball of the Wild Men) was a {{masquerade}} ball held on 28January 1393 in Paris {{at which}} Charles VI of France {{performed in a}} dance with {{five members of the}} French nobility. Four of <b>the</b> <b>dancers</b> were killed in a fire caused by a torch brought in by a spectator, Charles's brother Louis, Duke of Orléans. Charles and another of <b>the</b> <b>dancers</b> survived. The ball was {{one of a number of}} events intended to entertain the young king, who the previous summer had suffered an attack of insanity. The event undermined confidence in Charles's capacity to rule; Parisians considered it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against the more powerful members of the nobility. The public's outrage forced the King and his brother Orléans, whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted regicide and sorcery, to offer penance for the event.|$|E
5|$|Bob {{has been}} fooled by Jeanie's lies {{about why they}} are not going out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob to watch what happens in the wings during the {{upcoming}} Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight. Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts the tray back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as more and more of <b>the</b> <b>dancers</b> become aware something has gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.|$|E

40|$|Intrigued as ex-professional <b>dancer</b> by <b>the</b> uncomfortable {{idea of the}} {{performer}} being perceived as object, this performative paper provides a phenomenological account of <b>the</b> <b>dancer’s</b> authority. <b>The</b> paper seeks {{to move beyond the}} dichotomy object/subject. Merleau-Ponty’s (1962, 1968) theories of “Phenomenology of Perception” and “The visible and the invisible” provide the theoretical framework that forms the basis {{for the creation of a}} unique piece in which <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> progressively explores <b>the</b> concept of authority. During performance, <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> oscillates between <b>the</b> position of perceiving object and the position of subject of perception. As subject of perception, <b>the</b> <b>dancer</b> has been portrayed only as mere object or as body (Jowitt, 1988, Daly, 1988, Risner 2000), subjected to the choreographer’s wishes, the choreographic text and performance conventions.

The event was chronicled by contemporary writers such as the Monk of St Denis and Jean Froissart, and illustrated in a number of 15th-century illuminated manuscripts by painters such as the Master of Anthony of Burgundy. The incident later provided inspiration for Edgar Allan Poe's short story Hop-Frog.|$|E
5|$|Drowned World Tour was {{the fifth}} concert tour by American singer-songwriter Madonna in support of her seventh and eighth studio albums Ray of Light and Music.
