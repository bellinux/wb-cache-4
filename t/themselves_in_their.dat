5|$|Approximately {{forty minutes}} after his collapse, a police {{helicopter}} took Simpson to nearby Avignon hospital, {{where he was}} pronounced dead at 5:40p.m. Dumas refused to sign a burial certificate and a poisons expert from Marseille was commissioned to conduct an autopsy. Two empty tubes of amphetamines and a half-full tube {{were found in the}} rear pocket of his racing jersey, one of which was labelled Tonedron. The British team was called in for questioning and their baggage was searched. Two of the Belgian soigneurs– who looked after riders on the British team including Simpson– locked <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> room, got drunk and did not come out.|$|E
5|$|The hydroid Hydractinia angusta has a mutualistic {{relationship}} with the scallop. A study showed that its larvae preferentially settled {{in the vicinity of}} other epibionts, usually on scallop shells, and that the scallop larvae were deterred from settling in the vicinity of colonies of the hydroid. It is surmised that the hydroid benefits from a solid substrate on which to live, and although the scallop benefits from the protection from predators provided by the stinging cells of the hydroid, it is disadvantaged by the failure of its larvae to establish <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> preferred location, on the shells of mature scallops.|$|E
5|$|The 167 Bikini {{residents}} who {{were moved to}} the Rongerik Atoll prior to the Crossroads tests were unable to gather sufficient food or catch enough fish and shellfish to feed <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> new environment. The Navy left food and water {{for a few weeks}} and then failed to return in a timely manner. By January 1947, visitors to Rongerik reported the islanders were suffering malnutrition, facing potential starvation by July, and were emaciated by January 1948. In March 1948 they were evacuated to Kwajalein, and then settled onto another uninhabited island, Kili, in November. With only one third of a square mile, Kili has one sixth the land area of Bikini and, more important, has no lagoon and no protected harbor. Unable to practice their native culture of lagoon fishing, they became dependent on food shipments. Their four thousand descendants today are living on several islands and in foreign countries.|$|E

5|$|The Eastern small footed bat {{is between}} 65 and 95millimeters in length, has a {{wingspan}} of 210 to 250millimeters, and weighs between 4 and 8grams. The bat {{got its name}} from its abnormally small hind feet, which are only 7 to 8 millimeters long. The fur on the dorsal side of their body is dark at the roots, and fades to a light brown at the tips, which gives the bats a signature shiny, yellow-brown appearance. The fur on the dorsal {{side of the body}} is a dull gray color, which is believed to help camouflage <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> hibernacula. The defining characteristic of this bat is its face-mask, which is completely black. They also have black ears, wings and interfemoral membrane, (the membrane between the legs and tail). Like all bats, the Eastern small-footed bat has a patagium that connects the body to the forelimbs and tail, allowing the animal to fly. Their head is very flat and short, with a forehead that slopes gradually away from the rostrum, a feature that is unique to other individuals in the Myotis species. They have erect ears, which are very broad at the base and a short flat nose. They have a keeled calcar (protruding cartridge on the hind legs to support the interfemoral membrane) as well as a pointed tragus Their tail is between 25-45 millimeters in length and protrudes past their interfemoral membrane, and they have a dental formula of 2/3, 1/1, 3/3, 3/3.|$|E

25|$|Steven Best and Douglas Kellner {{identify}} Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns {{as part of}} {{the transitional}} phase, influenced by Marcel Duchamp, between modernism and postmodernism.

25|$|One of the {{conclusions}} of the Yalta Conference was that the western Allies would return all Soviet citizens who found <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> zones to the Soviet Union.

25|$|In {{the morning}} of only the second day, a {{rebellion}} broke out among the volunteer prisoners. They ripped off their uniforms and locked <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> cells by pushing their beds up against the door. In response to this, the guards became very angry and called for backup. This surprised Zimbardo {{as well as the}} rest of the psychologists because they had not thought it would be taken this far. Guards who were not on duty were called in and the guards who were assigned to only the night shift stayed with the guards who came in all the way through their shift the next morning. The tactic the guards came up with was to fight back in order to discipline the unruly prisoners and make them obey. In response to the prisoners barricading <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> cells, the guards used fire extinguishers on them to get them away from the entrances.|$|E

25|$|Ancient Egyptian tombs and temples {{contained}} {{thousands of}} paintings, sculptures, and written works, which reveal {{a great deal}} about the people of that time. However, their depictions of <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> surviving art and artifacts are rendered in sometimes symbolic, rather than realistic, pigments. As a result, ancient Egyptian artifacts provide sometimes conflicting and inconclusive evidence of the ethnicity of the people who lived in Egypt during dynastic times.|$|E

The ship's doctor visited the admiral at Scapa Flow (where the ship was based); the admiral sent marines to arrest the three officers, and appointed a new commander to Nestor.|$|E
