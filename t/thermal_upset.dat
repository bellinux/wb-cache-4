40|$|Abstract A silicon-photonic link is monolithically-integrated in a bulk CMOS {{process for}} the first time. Deep-trench {{isolation}} enables polySi waveguide integration. PolySi resonant detectors remove the need for Ge integration. Split-diode design enables half-rate receivers, mitigating transistor speed limitations. An on-chip feedback loop locks the resonant defect detector to the laser wavelength, combating <b>thermal</b> <b>upset.</b> The 5 m optical link achieves 5 Gb/s at 3 pJ/b electrical and 13 pJ/b optical energy, in 0. 18 µm (100 ps FO 4) bulk CMOS memory periphery process...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the fabrication {{and testing of}} continuous fiber ceramic composite (CFCC) based hot gas filters. The fabrication approach utilized a modified filament winding method that combined both continuous and chopped fibers into a novel microstructure. The work was divided into five primary tasks. In the first task, a preliminary set of compositions was fabricated {{in the form of}} open end tubes and characterized. The results of this task were used to identify the most promising compositions for sub-scale filter element fabrication and testing. In addition to laboratory measurements of permeability and strength, exposure testing in a coal combustion environment was performed to asses the thermo-chemical stability of the CFCC materials. Four candidate compositions were fabricated into sub-scale filter elements with integral flange and a closed end. Following the 250 hour exposure test in a circulating fluid bed combustor, the retained strength ranged from 70 t 145 percent of the as-fabricated strength. The post-test samples exhibited non-catastrophic failure behavior in contrast to the brittle failure exhibited by monolithic materials. Filter fabrication development continued in a filter improvement and cost reduction task that resulted in an improved fiber architecture, the production of a net shape flange, and an improved low cost bond. These modifications were incorporated into the process and used to fabricate 50 full-sized filter elements for testing in demonstration facilities in Karhula, Finland and at the Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF) in Wilsonville, AL. After 581 hours of testing in the Karhula facility, the elements retained approximately 87 percent of their as-fabricated strength. In addition, mechanical response testing at Virginia Tech provided a further demonstration of the high level of strain tolerance of the vacuum wound filter elements. Additional testing in the M. W. Kellogg unit at the PSDF has accumulated over 1800 hours of coal firing at temperatures of 760 °C including a severe <b>thermal</b> <b>upset</b> that resulted in the failure of several monolithic oxide elements. No failures of any kind have been reported for the MTI CFCC elements in either of these test campaigns. Additional testing is planned at the M. W. Kellogg unit and Foster Wheeler unit at the PSDF over the next year in order to qualify for consideration for the Lakeland PCFB. Process scale-up issues have been identified and manufacturing plans are being evaluated {{to meet the needs of}} future demand...|$|E
40|$|The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory {{is being}} {{constructed}} {{as the latest}} in a series of high-power laser facilities to study inertial confinement fusion. In particular, the NIF will generate and amplify 192 laser beams and focus them onto a fusion fuel capsule the size of a BB. The energy deposited by the laser beams will raise the core temperature of the target to 100,OOO,OOO C, which will ignite the fusion fuel and produce a fusion energy output that is several times greater than the energy input. The ability to generate, condition, and focus 192 laser beams onto a target the size of a BB, requires precision optical hardware and instrumentation. One of the most critical pieces of optical hardware within the NIF is the Optics Module (OM), a mechanical apparatus which is responsible for optical focusing and frequency conversion of the laser beam to optimize the energy deposition at the fusion target. The OM contains two potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP), frequency conversion crystals and a focusing lens. The functionality of the KDP crystals is extremely temperature sensitive. Small temperature changes on the order of 0. 1 C can significantly alter the performance of these components. Consequently, to maximize NIF system availability and minimize beam conditioning problems, accurate temperature control of the OM optical components was deemed a necessity. In this study, an experimental OM prototype, containing mock frequency conversion crystals and a focusing lens, was used determine the thermal stability provided by a prototype water temperature control system. More importantly, the OM prototype was used to identify and characterize potential <b>thermal</b> <b>upsets</b> and corresponding recovery times of the KDP crystals. The results of this study indicate that the water temperature control system is adequate in maintaining uniform steady-state temperatures within the OM. Vacuum pump-down and venting of the OM generated significant temperature changes in the optical components. However, the corresponding recovery times of the optical components were found to be less than three hours, well within the seven hour limit posed by NW operations. Simulated laser shots also were found to create <b>thermal</b> <b>upsets</b> within the OM's optical components over a range of heat deposition rates. However, the recovery times of these <b>thermal</b> <b>upsets</b> were found to be less than one hour. Finally, the use of non-contact infrared thermocouples was demonstrated as an effective means to track the temperature of the OM's optics...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 51 As {{the usage}} of {{sealless}} pumps increases, so do the demands for journal bearing materials that can operate successfully through the <b>thermal</b> <b>upsets</b> that can take place in these pumps. Material specification literature is only a start at making a knowledgeable choice. A test facility and procedure was developed to evaluate different journal bearings materials for use in sealless pumps. The facility simulates an actual American Petroleum Institute (APO) sealless pump bearing installation. Fifteen different materials combinations were tested. Tabulated and graphed test results are presented. A 30 percent carbon fiber polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and a 15 percent graphite filled polyimide material operated 40 minutes in a no flush water condition. Silicon carbide {{and most of the}} carbon graphite based materials had no wear after the no flush water tests were terminated. Polymer based materials had the most wear and operated the shortest amount of time in the no flush water condition...|$|R

50|$|Typhoid fever {{occurs when}} Salmonella {{bacteria}} enter the lymphatic system and cause a systemic form of salmonellosis. Endotoxins first {{act on the}} vascular and nervous apparatus, resulting in increased permeability and decreased tone of the vessels, <b>upset</b> <b>thermal</b> regulation, vomiting, and diarrhea. In severe forms of the disease, enough liquid and electrolytes are lost to upset the water-salt metabolism, decrease the circulating blood volume and arterial pressure, and cause hypovolemic shock. Septic shock may also develop. Shock of mixed character (with signs of both hypovolemic and septic shock) are more common in severe salmonellosis. Oliguria and azotemia develop in severe cases {{as a result of}} renal involvement due to hypoxia and toxemia.|$|R
40|$|Linear {{friction}} welding (LFW) {{is a solid}} state joining process which - if implemented successfully - allows for significant weight savings in modern aero-engines with subsequent benefits such as increased performance, fuel economy and reduced CO 2 emissions. Weight reductions are achieved by joining blades and discs forming an integrally bladed disc known as a blisk. In this dissertation a finite element model is presented, which simulates the LFW process, specifically the formation of <b>thermal</b> profiles, <b>upset</b> rates, flash morphologies and in-plane forces. Experimental trial studies investigating heat generation, process parameters and weld-interface geometries were conducted using a laboratory scale LFW apparatus to (i) validate models and (ii) improve understanding of the process. It was {{used in conjunction with}} high speed photography to study the mechanisms by which material is extruded and the ash is formed. A criterion is proposed that allows predicting its morphology. The model was validated against a wide range of key process parameters (frequency, amplitude, pressure) and shown to be in good agreement with experimental data. Main focus lies on joining of the titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V due to its industrial relevance, but joints applying dissimilar materials (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V - Ti- 6 Al- 2 Sn- 4 Zn- 6 Mo) are also investigated. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the equipment for nondestructive testing of electroexplosive devices using a thermal coupling technique. The technique utilizes a self-balancing bridge {{to apply a}} nominal amount of power to the bridge wire of the device. The bridge wire behaving as a thermal sensor detects heat flow into the device when heat is preferentially directed {{down the center of}} the explosive column toward the bridge wire. <b>Thermal</b> equilibrium is <b>upset</b> and the change in power from the self-balancing bridge is measured directly in watts. Faults such as omissions, incorrect materials, contamination, and so on, can be detected by observing the rate of heat flow to the bridge wire. The response is indicative of the thermal resistance and diffusivity of the system. The paper also presents data on electroexplosive devices loaded with inert and explosive materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of elevated air temperature in the first grow period on some physiological indicators of broiler chickens of different origin. Day-old Ross 308 and Hubbard Flex broiler chickens were assigned to 4 groups. Groups I (Ross 308) and II (Hubbard Flex) were kept under standard thermal conditions throughout rearing, and groups III (Ross 308) and IV (Hubbard Flex) were exposed to 10 °C higher than recommended air temperature from 1 to 21 days of rearing. At 1, 21 and 42 days of the experiment, blood was collected from 10 birds in each group to determine T 3 and T 4, total protein, immunoglobulin complex, glucose, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. The exposure to the thermal challenge decreased T 3 and T 4 levels at 21 days of rearing in both Ross 308 and Hubbard flex broilers compared to birds raised under standard thermal conditions. At 21 days of the experiment was observed a statistically significantly lower concentration of total protein in group I compared with group III and between group II and IV. There was no effect of elevated air temperature on the immunoglobulin complex concentration in the blood of birds of both genetic groups. In both genetic groups, the exposure to the thermal challenge caused a tendency to decrease the concentration of glucose. Statistically significant differences at 21 days of rearing of the hemoglobin content were observed between Ross 308 birds from groups I and III. The thermal challenge caused a statistically significant decrease in hematocrit levels in birds from both genetic groups at 21 days of the experiment. The <b>thermal</b> challenge <b>upset</b> the body’s homeostasis in both genetic groups of chickens, which possibly suggests that elevated air temperature during the first period of rearing has a negative effect on the welfare of broilers, regardless of their origin...|$|R
