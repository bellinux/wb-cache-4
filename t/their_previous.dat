After <b>their</b> <b>previous</b> album, The Great Escape, the band faced media backlash and relationships between the members became strained.|$|E

The album was recorded from September 2006 to February 2007 at Avatar Studios in New York City, after the band's first break from summer touring in ten years.

The band only took a break from recording to organize and perform at Summersault in 2000.
