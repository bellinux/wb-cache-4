5000|$|The {{government}} of Salta Province initiated {{the reform of}} its water sector in 1996. At the same time many other Argentinean provinces and municipalities brought {{in the private sector}} to improve water and sanitation services. While Salta also followed this approach, the process differed somewhat from the one in many other parts of Argentina. First, the provincial government conducted a series of meetings with municipalities and user organizations to discuss the benefits and risks of the concession before it was bid out. This process of consultations was continued by the private concessionaire after the contract was awarded. Second, the government decided from the onset that water and sanitation services in the poor province could not be financed entirely through tariff revenues. It thus decided to finance much of the investments to be undertaken by the private concessionaire with public grants, in addition to providing consumption subsidies. Third, the regulatory agency allowed the concessionaire to provide services at a lower standard in remote or isolated areas that were deemed unprofitable at conventional service standards. Fourth, the provincial regulatory agency granted tariff increases before and even after the 2001 economic crisis.

Under <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>contracts,</b> Israel serviced Israeli planes within the air force inventory as well as Boeing civilian aircraft flown by TAME and Ecuatoriana Airlines. Ecuador reportedly also employed Israeli security specialists as consultants {{in the fight against}} terrorism. In 1976 Ecuador became the first foreign country to order the Kfir, an advanced jet-fighter equipped with the General Electric J-79 engine produced in Israel under license. The transaction, which required United States government approval because of the engine technology, was rejected by the administration of President Jimmy Carter in order to discourage the proliferation of sophisticated military equipment in the Third World. The action caused an uproar in Israel where the sale was regarded as an important breakthrough in Israels efforts to develop international markets for the Kfir. In 1981, after the inauguration of President Ronald Reagan, Washington removed its objection to the sale. Although the contract called for the purchase of 12 Kfirs and an option to purchase an additional 12, Ecuador acquired only the original group, at a price estimated at US$196 million.|$|R
40|$|This study {{extends the}} prior {{research}} (Zahra and Das 1993) {{by examining the}} association between a company’s innovation strategy and its non-financial performance in the upstream and downstream strategic business units (SBUs) {{of oil and gas}} companies. The sequential model suggests a causal sequence among six dimensions of innovation strategy (leadership orientation, process innovation, product/service innovation, external innovation source, internal innovation source, and investment) that may lead to higher company non-financial performance (productivity and operational reliability). The study distributed a questionnaire (by mail, e-mailed web system, and focus group discussion) to three levels of managers (top, middle, and first-line) of 49 oil and gas companies with 140 SBUs in Indonesia. These qualified samples fell into 47 upstream (supply-chain) companies with 132 SBUs, and 2 downstream (demand-chain) companies with 8 SBUs. A total of 1, 332 individual usable questionnaires were returned thus qualified for analysis, representing an effective response rate of 50. 19 percent. The researcher conducts structural equation modeling (SEM) and hierarchical multiple regression analysis to assess the goodness-of-fit between the research models and the sample data and to test whether innovation strategy mediates the impact of leadership orientation on company non-financial performance. SEM reveals that the models have met goodness-of-fit criteria, thus the interpretation of the sequential models fits with the data. The results of SEM and hierarchical multiple regression: (1) support the importance of innovation strategy as a determinant of company non-financial performance, (2) suggest that the sequential model is appropriate for examining the relationships between six dimensions of innovation strategy and company non-financial performance, and (3) show that the sequential model provides additional insights into the indirect contribution of the individual dimensions of innovation strategy (partially mediators) to company non-financial performance —productivity or operational reliability. The findings provide empirical evidence extending the previous model of Zahra and Das. These findings also provide a basis for useful recommendations to upstream and downstream SBU managers attempting to implement a sequential model of innovation strategy —company non-financial performance links. This study shows that upstream SBUs rely on external innovation sources. They will acquire innovation policies through business partnership development (such as Joint Operation Body for Enhanced Oil Recovery or JOB-EOR, Joint Operation Body for Production Sharing Contract or JOB-PSC); licensing agreements (<b>Technical</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Contract</b> or TAC, Consortium Cooperation System); or acquisition with other firms (Joint Operating Contract or JOC). In contrast, downstream SBUs emphasize on generating internal innovation sources to develop their own in-house R&D efforts. The downstream SBUs should make extensive policies of internal innovation sources in their attempts to control the distribution of oil-based fuel and transmission of natural gas for domestic and international markets effectively. Both policies would enhance understanding and ultimately contribute to the improvement of company financial performance —sales, net profit margin, return on assets...|$|E

40|$|Abstract onlyMadagascar is the world, fourth biggest island, {{and one of}} the world‚ poorest countries. Given its severe poverty, Madagascar has no {{large-scale}} domestic fleet. Consequently, it {{is required}} by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to rent these un-exploited resources to distant water fleets (DWFs) from other nations through access agreements. We present an analysis of access agreements signed between DWFs and the Republic of Madagascar valid in 2011. All agreements were appraised based on a number of criteria, including reporting requirements, fees, observers, restrictions and bycatch limits. Our findings highlight consistent severe shortcomings, in particular with regards to the contractual obligations and accountability of DWFs in reporting catches which result in signatories having no disincentive for over-exploitation and illegal fishing. Our analysis shows that of a total of seven agreements authorizing fishing by 170 vessels, only one agreement has a quota in place. Only two require mandatory inspection before a fishing campaign. One agreement is exempt from having any observers on boats and the European Union, whose fleet accounts the majority of licensed vessels (124), does not address the issue of bycatch. Our findings highlight many of the challenges faced by coastal developing nations in renting their fisheries resources. Whilst it is widely recognized that such states need assistance in improving MCS capacity, our analysis suggests that <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> in <b>contract</b> development and negotiation should be a fundamental pre-requisite to establishing a fair and sustainable fisheries access agreement framework...|$|R
40|$|Contract {{farming is}} seen by proponents {{as a way to}} raise small-farm income by {{delivering}} technology and market information to small farmers, incorporating them into remunerative new markets. Critics, however, see it as a strategy for agribusiness firms to pass production risk to farmers, taking advantage of an unequal bargaining relationship. There is also concern that contract farming will worsen rural income inequality by favoring larger farmers. This study examines these issues in Shandong Province, China, using survey data collected from 162 apple and green onion farmers and interviews with four contracting firms in 2005. Using a probit model to estimate participation in a contract-farming scheme, we find little evidence that contracting firms prefer to work with larger farmers, though all farms in the area are quite small. Furthermore, using a Heckman selection-correction model to control for possible selection bias, we find that contract farmers earn significantly more than independent farmers after controlling for household labor availability, education, farm size, and other characteristics. Finally, we find that the way contracting contributes to farm income varies between commodities: contract apple growers benefit from higher yields (presumably due to <b>technical</b> <b>assistance),</b> while <b>contract</b> green onion growers receive higher prices (presumably due to better quality). These results suggest that contract farming can help small farmers raise their incomes and gain access to the growing urban and export markets. Questions remain regarding the number of farmers that are, or could be, brought into similar contract arrangements.
