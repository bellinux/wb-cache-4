5|$|A new bow type, {{in which}} bone {{reinforcements}} cover {{the handle of}} the bow as well as the tips, may have developed in Central Asia during the 3rd to 2nd century BCE, with earliest finds from the area of Lake Baikal. Fittings from <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of bow appear right across Asia from Korea to the Crimea. Such bows with reinforcement of both grip and siyahs have been called “Hun,” “Hunnic” or “Hsiung-nu” composite bows. Huns did use such bows, but so did many other peoples; Rausing termed <b>this</b> <b>type</b> the 'Qum-Darya Bow' from the Han Chinese type-site at the frontier post of Loulan, {{at the mouth of the}} Qum Darya river, dated by analogy between c. 1st century BCE and the 3rd century CE.|$|E

5000|$|Cape Flats Sand Fynbos is {{the most}} {{threatened}} vegetation type at Tokai. [...] Only 11% of <b>this</b> veld <b>type</b> is left. Less than 1% is conserved at present, making Tokai the most important nature reserve for <b>this</b> veld <b>type.</b> The veld type currently contains 108 IUCN Red List species (92 threatened with extinction, 4 already extinct, and 12 other species of conservation concern). It thus qualifies nationally as Critically Endangered, both on account of its destruction and its high numbers of threatened species. The sudden change in status of Tokai is not due to anything at Tokai itself, it {{is due to the}} rapid loss of Cape Flats Sand Fynbos elsewhere in Cape Town. Projections of urban growth predict that unless something is urgently done, all remaining veld will be lost by 2020, leaving Tokai as the biggest reserve of <b>this</b> veld <b>type.</b> Several plant species are already extinct (e.g. Erica verticillata). The City of Cape Town has targeted the Blouberg area as a priority conservation area to try and save a representative portion of <b>this</b> veld <b>type.</b> <b>This</b> is a dry region (rainfall 410 mm per year) - Tokai represents the wettest examples of <b>this</b> veld <b>type,</b> with almost double (190%) the average rainfall for <b>this</b> veld <b>type.</b> There are 2 IUCN Red Data List frog species on site.|$|R

30|$|However, when {{agents of}} <b>this</b> {{particular}} <b>type</b> abound (say the other type {{is close to}} extinction), an agent of <b>this</b> particular <b>type</b> will generally be matched with agents of his/her own type (see footnote 15). Thus, if all the agents in a group are of the same type, they respond {{in the same way}} to the same environment. They all perform equally. The competitors of a particular agent in his/her own group are as successful (or unsuccessful) as he/she is. Thus, selection does not depend at all on the performance of <b>this</b> particular <b>type</b> of agent: the probability of winning depends almost entirely on how many people are selected. Therefore, the probability of <b>this</b> particular <b>type</b> of agent winning is strongly influenced by an increase in the strength of competition.|$|R
5|$|In mixed inhibition, the {{inhibitor}} {{can bind to}} {{the enzyme}} {{at the same time}} as the enzyme's substrate. However, the binding of the inhibitor affects the binding of the substrate, and vice versa. <b>This</b> <b>type</b> of inhibition can be reduced, but not overcome by increasing concentrations of substrate. Although it is possible for mixed-type inhibitors to bind in the active site, <b>this</b> <b>type</b> of inhibition generally results from an allosteric effect where the inhibitor binds to a different site on an enzyme. Inhibitor binding to this allosteric site changes the conformation (i.e., tertiary structure or three-dimensional shape) of the enzyme so that the affinity of the substrate for the active site is reduced.|$|E
