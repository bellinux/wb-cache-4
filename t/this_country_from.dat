[...] The law regarding piracy trials was changed at the beginning of the eighteenth century, granting more relaxed rules and allowing for trials to take place in English colonies, so long as a Court of Admiralty was available. Pirates faced greater danger of being executed when the law changed, as it stated if a pirate was taken at sea, an official trial was not necessary, but the end result of execution was to be the same. An act in 1700 allowed for the expansion of the definition of piracy to include not just those [...] "who committed robbery by sea," [...] but also the [...] "mutineer who ran away with the ship" [...] as well as the [...] "sailor who interfered with the defense of his vessel" [...] under a pirate siege.
