25|$|The {{contracts}} {{controlled by}} <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Council</b> expired on February 1, 1936. Gold faced a difficult task: In just six months, {{he had to}} rebuild the locals which had remained with the IFWU while preparing the union for a strike {{in the depths of}} a depression. A strike was authorized on January 18, but Gold quickly accepted the services of an impartial mediator to assist with the negotiations. In the final few days of January, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia intervened and heard presentations from both sides. The intervention by government officials worked, and a new contract reached on February 1.|$|E

2500|$|The IFWU, meanwhile, {{organized}} a new [...] "Joint Council" [...] {{to replace the}} Joint Board. On March 2, 1927, <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Council</b> announced it was the true collective bargaining agent for all New York City fur workers, that it alone administered their union contracts, and that they must become members of <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Council</b> or be fired by their employers. Thousands of workers refused; many were fired, and some had to be forcibly removed from their place of employment in protest. Gold and the Joint Board fought the Joint Council's actions. As the dispute between the Joint Board and Joint Council continued, employers ceased to honor the 1926 contract. Soon, the work week crept as high as 70 hours over seven days. Overtime pay was eliminated, wages were cut {{by as much as}} 50 percent, and subcontracting became rampant.|$|E
2500|$|Although Gold was {{on trial}} for assault and bribery, he led the Joint Board in a counter-organizing {{campaign}} against the AFL-dominated Joint Council. He personally led mass pickets and protests in the fur district of New York City in late March 1927. The AFL attempted to undercut the Joint Board by releasing statements that the Gold-led union was seeking a [...] "peace treaty" [...] with <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Council,</b> while accusing the Joint Board of coercing workers into joining. Despite AFL assertions that workers were stampeding into <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Council,</b> the Gold-led Joint Board {{had the support of}} the vast majority of workers in the New York City fur industry. The Joint Board's strength among the workers was so strong that on May 3, 1927, the Fur Trimming Manufacturers' Association broke with the employers' group and signed a contract with Gold's Joint Board—reaffirming the 1926 contract and restoring working conditions to their June 1926 level.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} and fall of 1928, Gold began {{building}} support for a new international union of fur workers. [...] He met with the leaders of eight non-New York City fur workers' locals as well as a left-wing group of fur workers who were attempting to disaffiliate from what remained of <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Council.</b> Included in the new union were 15,000 dressmakers and other garment workers comprising the left wing of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. The new Needle Trades Workers Industrial Union was formed on January 1, 1929. Louis Hyman was elected President, and Ben Gold was elected Secretary-Treasurer. The thirty-nine member General Executive Board included African Americans, Russians, Poles, Greeks, women and even a youth delegate.|$|E

2500|$|On April 9, 2008, the Councils of the Cherokee Nation and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians at <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Council</b> Meeting held in Catoosa, Oklahoma {{passed a}} resolution: [...] "Opposing Fabricated Cherokee 'Tribes' and 'Indians'." [...] It denounced further {{state or federal}} {{recognition}} of so-called Cherokee tribes or bands. These tribes committed to exposing and assisting state and federal authorities in eradicating any group that attempts or claims to operate as a government of the Cherokee people. The resolution asked that no public funding from any federal or state government should be expended on behalf of non-federally recognized Cherokee tribes or bands. The Nation stated it would call for a full accounting of all federal monies given to state recognized, unrecognized or 501(c)(3) charitable organizations that claimed any Cherokee affiliation. It called for {{federal and state governments}} to stringently apply a federal definition of [...] "Indian", to include citizens of federally recognized Indian tribes, to prevent non-Indians from selling membership in so-called Cherokee tribes for the purpose of exploiting the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990. [...] In a controversial segment that could affect Cherokee Baptist churches and charitable organizations, the resolution stated that no 501(c)(3) organization, state recognized, or unrecognized groups shall be acknowledged as Cherokee.|$|E
2500|$|Gold began {{threatening}} a new {{strike to}} force the employers to honor {{the terms of the}} 1926 contract and win recognition of the Joint Board again. The AFL accused the Joint Board of being a communist front, and pleaded for the public to withdraw support for it. In confidential talks with the New York City police, the AFL conceded that Gold's union had the support of the workers and {{that the only way to}} defeat the [...] "Red-led" [...] union was a massive show of police force which would intimidate the strikers. Mass arrests and heavy fines, coupled with long jail terms, would bankrupt the Joint Board and terrify the protesters, AFL officials and staff told the police. The strike began on June 3, 1927, with several thousand picketers taking to the streets and police arresting hundreds of workers. When the police proved unable to control the large number of strikers, they began isolating groups of two or three people (often women) and beating them with clubs. The extreme police response led Gold to call strike after strike, most of which were broken up by police attacks on peaceful picketers and which led to scores of arrests and jail sentences. The AFL and its leadership again accused Gold and the Joint Board of terrorizing workers in order {{to force the}}m to join the union, and claimed that only <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Council</b> had the support of the majority of workers.|$|E
