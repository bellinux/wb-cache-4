30|$|Finally, the {{abrasion}} of the sleeve, {{which is}} usually made of aluminium, caused during the drilling process, {{needs to be taken}} into account, especially for longer implants, where the drill engages the sleeve for a longer time. Horwitz et al. [24] found in their in vitro study that multiple uses of the drill and sleeve reduced the accuracy of the system. Cassetta et al. [12] using a modification on the External Hex Safe® (Materialise Dental, Leuven, Belgium) system (Group A) in order to minimise tolerance and reduce friction and damaging of the sleeve by the drill motion showed statistically improved accuracy in a retrospective clinical study. This could be interpreted as the best practice being <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleeves</b> for a single time and the drills for the times recommended by the manufacturer.

However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: No {{data has}} been {{published}} on the management of in-stent restenotic bifurcation lesions. The aim of this small case series {{was to examine the}} angiographic and long-term clinical outcomes <b>of</b> <b>using</b> <b>sleeve</b> technique to treat this lesion subset. METHODS: Six consecutive and symptomatic patients with MEDINA classification 1, 1, 1 in-stent restenotic bifurcation lesion were treated with drug-eluting stents using sleeve technique. Dual antiplatelet therapy was prescribed for an average of 13. 5 +/- 2. 3 months. RESULTS: Most of the lesions (87 %) were located at LAD/diagonal branch bifurcation. Kissing balloon inflation was performed successfully in all the patients. Follow-up angiography at nine months revealed a late loss of 0. 35 +/- 0. 26 mm and 0. 56 +/- 0. 56 mm in MV and SB, respectively. Angiographic restenosis was developed in 2 patients (33 %), which were all located at the SB ostium. No in-hospital MACE was observed. One-year MACE was 17 %, attributed by 1 patient with restenosis who needed revascularization. The mean follow up period was 50 +/- 18 months, no stent thrombosis was detected. CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleeve</b> technique to treat in-stent restenotic bifurcation lesions is associated with good acute procedural result, a fairly low one-year MACE and long-term clinical safety. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|A unique children’s upper-limb {{prosthesis}} prototype with {{an improved}} suspension and electronic interconnect has been developed. Silicone liners provide effective suspension for prostheses. However, {{they have been}} problematic for the upper extremity myoelectric application. Recently, we fit a child using a silicone liner and hardwired, remote electrodes. During this fitting, a number of challenges were encountered, including wire breakage, difficulty of electrode and wire attachment, and difficulty donning/doffing the prosthesis due to mechanical hindrance from the wires and the modifications made to accommodate them. Consequently, we developed an electromechanical quick-connect attachment. It enables the user to easily connect/disconnect the prosthetic shell and hand system to/from the liner, yet still provides for the mechanical suspension/connection between liner and prosthesis and provides for the electrical connection of sensor electrodes with control electronics. For adults and children with upper-extremity limb loss, this development makes <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> silicone <b>sleeve</b> systems more practical...|$|R

Weight loss of the patient after operation was spectacular, with dropping the body weight to 93 kg during the first year after the laparoscopic procedure. Then, the excess abdominal skin was removed during three scheduled interventions in the Plastic Surgery Department. The first plastic surgery operation removed 4 kg of excess skin from her abdomen.

We sought to develop {{an alternative to the}} traditional approaches for this problem. This article describes <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a <b>sleeve</b> gastrectomy in an obese patient with a large recurrent paraesophageal hernia. Case Report: A morbidly obese 70 -year-old woman presented with a 1 -year history of chest pain, cough, dysphagia, and dyspnea. She had undergone an open paraesophageal hernia repair 8 years earlier. Diagnostic workup revealed a recurrent large paraesophageal hernia. Laparoscopically, we took down all adhesions, excised the hernia sac, reduced the stomach and distal esophagus into the abdomen, and closed the hiatus. We then resected the greater curvature and fundus of the stomach, leaving the lesser curve in a sleeve configuration. Eighteen months after the operation, the patient’s chest pain, cough, dyspnea, and dysphagia were resolved. In addition, she has lost 57 pounds (255 to 198).

40|$|Fundoplication {{operations}} have gained wide acceptance {{as an effective}} and durable treatment for chronic gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, further valid data are required on the long-term efficacy and above all the corresponding profile of operation specific side effects. Depending on {{the magnitude of the}} postfundoplication problems, there is an obvious need for well-controlled data on how the design of a fundoplication procedure should be further developed in order to minimise the side effects without compromising with the level of reflux control. Patients and methodsThe present investigation incorporates three series of chronic GERD patients who were found suitable of antireflux surgery. Originally 137 patients were randomised to be either on open total fundoplication (Nissen-Rossetti) or a posterior partial wrap (Toupet). This group was subsequently followed during a median period of almost 12 years. Secondly 99 chronic GERD patients were randomly allocated to have a laparoscopic total fundoplication with or without a complete mobilisation of the fundus by division of all short gastric vessels. Finally 95 patients had either a Toupet partial fundoplication or an anterior partial wrap according to Watson. These operations were done laparoscopically. In the pre and postoperative evaluation all the patients were investigated by standardised questionnaire to assess symptoms, manometry and ambulatory 24 -hour pH monitoring as well as endoscopy. In the postoperative setting endoscopy was only regularly used in study I. In a subset of patients a more extensive manometric protocol was followed, incorporating <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>sleeve</b> sensor and gasdistension of the stomach. ResultsA posterior partial fundoplication was found to be equally effective in controlling GERD as a total fundic wrap. The downside of the latter procedure was, however, that gasbloat like complaints were more frequent and remained fairly stable even after 12 years. The most frequent complain was from rectal flatus. When doing a laparoscopic total fundoplication no major clinical differences emerged between the two operative approaches. However, in patients with intact short gastric vessels data were obtained to suggest better abilities to vent air from the stomach (more TLESRs on distension). An anterior partial fundoplication was clearly inferior to a laparoscopic Toupet procedure in terms of reflux control without major differences in the profile of post fundoplication complaints. ConclusionA posterior fundoplication has obvious advantages over a total fundoplication with fewer associated postfundoplication symptoms with maintained high level of reflux control. An anterior partial wrap does not correct the physiology of the gastroesophageal junction nor the gastroesophageal reflux. When doing a total fundoplication {{there seems to be no}} advantage by mobilising the fundus through division of all short gastric vessels...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess <b>the</b> feasibility <b>of</b> <b>using</b> hydrogel-coated balloons to deliver biologically active agents to the blood vessel wall. Background. The tool intramural delivery of therapeutic agents during balloon angioplasty has been proposed as an adjunctive technique for preventing early intracoronary thrombosis and late restenosis. Methods. To assess the efficacy of delivery and depth of penetration in vitro, local delivery of horseradish peroxidase was performed in 40 porcine peripheral arteries, and delivery of fluoresceinated heparin was performed in 20 porcine peripheral arteries and 7 human atheromatous arteries. To determine the persistence of these agents in the vessel wall in vivo, horseradish peroxidase was delivered to 18 porcine peripheral arteries that were harvested at intervals of 45 min to 48 h. Fluoresceinated heparin was delivered to 22 porcine peripheral arteries, 14 with <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a protective <b>sleeve,</b> harvested at intervals of 30 s to 24 h. Results. In vitro agent delivery was successful in all specimens. The depth of penetration of horseradish peroxidase was directly related to both balloon pressure (p < 0. 04) and duration of inflation (p < 0. 01). In vivo peroxidase staining was evident at 45 and 90 min but not thereafter. With <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a protective <b>sleeve,</b> heparin was present in all arteries harvested at 30 s, with marked dissipation at 1 and 24 h. Without a sleeve, no fluorescein staining was detected in any artery. With both agents, delivery occurred consistently over broad regions of the vessel wall that were free of architectural disruption. Conclusions. Hydrogel-coated balloons can deliver biologically active agents to the vessel wall without gross tissue disruption and may provide an atraumatic method for the local delivery of therapeutic agents during balloon angioplasty...|$|R

Follow-up angiography was performed on 41 patients (91 %) at nine months. The mean age of patient was 65 years with predominance of male (73 %); FKB was successfully performed in all patients. Post-procedure myocardial infarction was observed in four patients, leading to an in-hospital major adverse cardiac event (MACE) rate of 9 %. At angiographic follow-up, the late loss in the main vessel and side-branch was 0. 18 ± 0. 26 mm and 0. 29 ± 0. 27 mm, respectively. Binary angiographic restenosis was seen in two patients (4. 7 %) at main vessel and one patient (2. 4 %) at side-branch.

30|$|Hydroxyapatite-coated pins show {{improved}} fixation strength, with extraction torque {{forces that}} are higher than the initial torque forces and 90 -fold {{higher than those of}} standard uncoated pins [59]. This improved fixation translates into lower rates of osteolysis and subsequently to lower incidences of pin loosening and lower pin site infection than uncoated pins [36, 42, 43, 44, 46, 49]. Hydroxyapatite–chlorhexidine-coated pins exhibit the dual benefits of enhanced bone stability through bonding to the pin (due to hydroxyapatite) and localised release of chlorhexidine. Silver-coated pins decrease bacterial colonisation [60] and result in fewer infections and PTI [53]. Unfortunately, silver-coated pins may induce cytotoxicity [61, 62, 63] as some authors have found significant amounts of silver in blood serum [60]. Diffused silver in the blood serum may act as a Trojan horse by entering cells and then releasing silver ions that damage intracellular function [63]. The bactericidal effect induced by nano-titanium dioxide (TiO 2) exposed to ultraviolet radiation has been used successfully in many areas, such as the disinfection of water and textiles and in other cleaning processes [64, 65, 66]. When irradiated by near-ultraviolet light, nano-TiO 2 shows strong bactericidal activity [65, 67]. One new, attractive perspective for combating PTI is the covalent bonding of antibiotics onto the surface of a titanium pin [4]. Other clinicians, such as Forster et al. [68] have assessed the potential <b>of</b> antibiotic polyurethane <b>sleeves</b> to inhibit bacterial colonisation on pins; based on their results, they concluded that <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> such <b>sleeves</b> should reduce the incidence of PTI.|$|R

50|$|Cylinder walls {{can become}} very worn or damaged from <b>use.</b> If <b>the</b> engine is not {{equipped}} with replaceable sleeves {{there is a}} limit to how far the cylinder walls can be bored or worn before the block must be sleeved or replaced. In such cases where <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a <b>sleeve</b> or liner can restore proper clearances to an engine. Sleeves are made out of iron alloys and are very reliable. A sleeve is installed by a machinist at a machine shop. The engine block is mounted on a precision boring machine where the cylinder is then bored to a size much larger than normal and a new cast-iron sleeve can be inserted with an interference fit. The sleeves can be pressed into place, or they can be held in by a shrink fit. This is done by boring the cylinder (between 3 and 6 thousandths of an inch) smaller than the sleeve being installed, then heating the engine block and while hot, the cold sleeve can be inserted easily. When the engine block cools down it shrink fits around the sleeve holding it into place. Cylinder wall thickness is important to efficient thermal conductivity in the engine. When choosing sleeves, engines have specifications to how thick the cylinder walls should be to prevent overworking the coolant system. Each engine's needs are different, dependent on designed work load duty cycle and energy produced. After selecting and installing the sleeve, the cylinder needs to be finish bored and honed to match the piston. Care needs to be given to the finish of the cylinder walls to prevent improper ring seating at break in.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The {{variable}} length, six-electrode {{plasma source}} for {{atomic emission spectroscopy}} described here is operated from three compact, simple, and inexpensive direct current power supplies. The vertical arcs formed between the three electrode pairs completely entrain the sample and are typically operated at 40 V and 20 A. Three concentric quartz tubes, similar to the ICP, supply argon, as well as sample, to the plasma. The argon consumption rate of typically 7. 4 L/min is comparable to or less than the consumption rates of commercial ICP and DCP systems and is achieved {{without the need for}} water cooling of any of the components. The plasma assembly is completely demountable to facilitate easy replacement of damaged parts and to provide experimental flexibility. Spatial shifts in the vertical emission profiles, similar to those documented for the ICP, occur with changes in the nebulizer gas flow rate and current. The MgII 280. 27 -nm emission and signal-to-background ratio (S/B) increase by factors of 23 and 10, respectively, for an increase in the current from 16 to 25 A. A twofold increase in the MgII 280. 27 -nm S/B occurs for an increase in the plasma length from 14 to 21. 5 mm. Detection limits for five elements range from 15 to 50 times higher than those for the ICP. These detection limits are achieved without <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> ceramic <b>sleeves.</b> Movement <b>of</b> the region of maximum emission to positions below the top of the outer quartz tube, which occur with the lengthening of the plasma, is thought to be the main reason for the poorer detection limits.

40|$|Abstract Background Proximal humerus {{fractures}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} common fractures. Intramedullary locked nailing is becoming a popular alternative treatment, especially for easier fracture patterns. Although axillary nerve injury has been reported, no study has compared the safety of the proximal locking options relative to the axillary nerve and the ascending branch of the anterior circumflex artery. Method Six different commercially available proximal humeral nails were implanted in 30 shoulders of 18 cadavers. After fluoroscopically guided implantation the shoulders were carefully dissected and the distance between the locking screws, the axillary nerve and the ascending branch of the anterior circumflex artery was measured. Results The course of the axillary nerve varies. A mean distance of 55. 8 mm (SD = 5. 3) between the lateral edge of the acromions and the axillary nerve at the middle of the humerus in a neutrally rotated position was observed. The minimum distance was 43. 4 mm, the maximum 63. 9 mm. Bent nails with oblique head interlocking bolts appeared to be the most dangerous in relation to the axillary nerve. The two designs featuring such a bend and oblique bolt showed a mean distance of the locking screw to the axillary nerve of 1 mm and 2. 7 mm respectively Sirus (Zimmer ®) and (Stryker ®) T 2 PHN (Proximal Humeral Nail)). Regarding the ascending branch of the anterior circumflex artery, there was no difference between the nails which have an anteroposterior locking option. Conclusion It is of great importance for surgeons treating proximal humerus fractures to understand the relative risk of any procedure they perform.

Eleven healthy male adults participated in this study. They were asked to walk 10 m on a level ground and perform one-leg hops with and without a knee sleeve. The segment angles and the response velocities of the thigh, shank, and foot were measured and calculated by using a motion analysis system. The phases between the segment angle and the velocity were then calculated. Moreover, the continuous relative phase (CRP) was calculated as the phase of the distal segment subtracted from the phase of the proximal segment and denoted as CRPTS (thigh–shank), CRPSF (shank–foot), and CRPTF (thigh–foot). The root mean square (RMS) values were <b>used</b> to evaluate <b>the</b> in-phase or out-of-phase states, while the standard deviation (SD) values were utilized to evaluate the variability in the stance and swing phases during level walking and in the preflight, flight, and landing phases during one-leg hopping. The walking velocity and the flight time improved when the knee sleeve was worn (p <  0. 05). The segment angles of the thigh and shank also changed when the knee sleeve was worn during level walking and one-leg hopping. The RMS values of CRPTS and CRPSF in the stance phase and the RMS values of CRPSF in the preflight and landing phases changed (p <  0. 05 in all cases). Moreover, the SD values of CRPTS in the landing phase and the SD values of CRPSF in the preflight and landing phases increased (p <  0. 05 in all cases). These results indicated that wearing a knee sleeve caused changes in segment kinematics and coordination...|$|R
40|$|Drilling into {{coal mine}} roof strata to install roof bolts has the {{potential}} to release substantial quantities of respirable dust. Due to the proximity of drill holes to the breathing zone of roof bolting personnel, dust escaping the holes and avoiding capture by the dust collection system pose a potential respiratory health risk. Controls are available to complement the typical dry vacuum collection system and minimize harmful exposures during the initial phase of drilling. This paper examines <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a bit <b>sleeve</b> in combination with a dust-hog-type bit to improve dust extraction during the critical initial phase of drilling. A twisted-body drill bit is also evaluated to determine the quantity of dust liberated in comparison with the dust-hog-type bit. Based on the results of our laboratory tests, the bit sleeve may reduce dust emissions by one-half during the initial phase of drilling before the drill bit is fully enclosed by the drill hole. Because collaring is responsible for the largest dust liberations, overall dust emission can also be substantially reduced. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a twisted-body bit has minimal improvement on dust capture compared with <b>the</b> commonly <b>used</b> dust-hog-type bit.

40|$|The {{relationships}} were investigated between the prickle discomfort scores, assessed by human response from wearer trial garment assessment, and sleeve trial, Wool ComfortMeter (WCM) and Wool HandleMeter (WHM) assessments of fabrics, and fiber diameter characteristics including mean fiber diameter (MFD). Sleeve trial assessment followed exercise, <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a control <b>sleeve</b> to reduce participant variance and four sensory traits. WHM provides eight handle parameters calibrated against {{a panel of}} experts. Four scenarios were evaluated: sleeve trial assessment with MFD; sleeve trial assessment with MFD and WCM; sleeve trial assessment with MFD, WCM and WHM parameters; and sleeve trial assessment with WCM and WHM parameters. Data were analyzed using correlation and forward stepwise general linear modeling. There {{was no evidence that}} the incidence of fibers coarser than 30 µm aided the prediction of prickle discomfort once MFD had been accounted for in the models. There were significant correlations between the WCM measurement and each sleeve trial attribute. There was no significant correlation between WHM parameters and sleeve trial assessments. The <b>sleeve</b> trial attribute <b>of</b> ‘skin feel’ offers potential to improve the predictions made of wearer trial prickle discomfort when <b>used</b> in association <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WCM with or without data on fabric MFD. There was little evidence to support using WHM parameters with or without the WCM in predicting wearer assessed prickle discomfort of fabrics. These results indicate that the rapid evaluation <b>of</b> fabrics <b>using</b> <b>sleeve</b> trial assessment can provide cost effective ranking of consumer preferences...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEarly skill {{development}} often occurs without {{the presence of}} a skilled instructor, or in settings where the skilled mentor is unable to provide prolonged one-to-one instruction and guidance. Interactive textiles are offering new scope for novice training. New textile sensors, such as strain sensors, are enabling measurement in a way that allows real-time feedback stimuli in diverse training and competition environments. The goal {{of this study was to}} explore the potential of a wearable interactive garment to provide rhythmic auditory biofeedback to augment the learning of a novice in a setting where there is no expert guidance. An “interactive sleeve” placed on the shooting arm provided auditory information in the form of drum beats to participants if they were successful in approximating a certain range of movement at the elbow and wrist during the execution of a modified netball shooting skill. It was thought that this form of biofeedback would provide a learning advantage relative to a control group who completed the same task wearing the garment with the biofeedback function disabled. Twenty-two secondary school children (16 ± 1 years) with limited to no previous netball or basketball free throw shooting experience participated voluntarily in this study. It was found that the interactive sleeve intervention group improved their throwing accuracy relative to the control group and that this was due to <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interactive <b>sleeve.</b> The effect <b>of</b> the interactive <b>sleeve</b> on throwing technique and learning is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} prickle discomfort sensations of wool fabrics are primarily determined by the mean fiber diameter of the wool. It is also known that differences in wool fiber curvature (crimp) affect softness of handle of greasy wool and of wool textiles. In a replicated experiment, we investigated if wearers could detect <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>using</b> 17 µm superfine wool of low (74 °/mm) or high (114 °/mm) fiber curvature, and when the wools were blended with 17 µm cashmere (fiber curvature 49 °/mm) in differing proportions, on four comfort sensations. Eight single jersey knitted fabrics were assessed under a controlled protocol <b>using</b> forearm <b>sleeves</b> made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test fabric and a control fabric. Data (37 sensorial assessments of high curvature wool fabrics; 38 sensorial assessments of low curvature wool fabrics) were analyzed using linear mixed model analysis (restricted maximum likelihood), which included fixed effects for wool type and blend ratio and a random effect for participant. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a control <b>sleeve</b> fabric reduced variance due to participant effects by providing an anchor for each sensation over time. Wool fiber curvature affected participant assessment of breathability, comfort, feel after exercise (damp/dry) and skin feel (prickly/soft), with preferred values associated with high curvature (crimp) superfine wool. Increasing the proportion of cashmere in fabrics increased skin feel (better assessed softness). Skin feel was strongly associated with {{the evaluation of the}} fabrics by the Wool ComfortMeter and with increasing hairiness of yarns...|$|R
