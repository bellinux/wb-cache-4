40|$|The <b>Triangular</b> Institutional <b>Cooperation</b> Project (TCP) {{seeks to}} promote South-South {{cooperation}} {{with the support of}} Northern partners and to strengthen the capabilities of NGOs in the management of natural resources in semi-arid areas. It rejuvenates development by being complement to development. From 1997 onwards it has been implemented in two phases (1997 - 2002 and 2003 - 2005). Field based initiatives, research studies and training programmes have been undertaken in India and Ethiopia by the partners in Ethiopia (REST and MU), India (IRMA and SWDF) and Norway (DF and NORAGRIC). Development Fund played the effective role of coordinating and cofinancing the project. TCP remains as a model for NGO-Research synergy in development. In the first phase focus was increasingly on research and training programmes alongside the larger objective of networking. In the second phase more field based activity orientation was envisaged. As a result, a number of post harvest technologies and cooperative initiatives have been implemented in addition to the bottom line of networking and capacity building among the partners.

40|$|This report {{reviews the}} Ethiopian {{portfolio}} of the Development Fund (DF), a Norwegian NGO, which {{has evolved from}} supporting relief work by one Tigrayan organisation in the 1980 s to supporting ten projects with several organisations in Tigray and Afar Regions and networking with other organisations in Ethiopia and beyond. The portfolio focuses on socio-economic development to alleviate poverty and increase food security, primarily through agriculture, and on natural resource management in dryland areas, including maintenance of biodiversity. The DF is giving growing attention to strengthening civil society and pastoral livelihood development. The portfolio has been managed in a satisfactory way through good communication and regular monitoring visits. The partnership model, built on mutual trust, involves considerable delegation of managerial responsibility to Ethiopian partners. This model is probably cost effective, although it involves certain risks. On the whole, the resources provided through the DF have been used efficiently to achieve the objectives. The DF’s participatory approach helps anchor projects in local communities and provides space for dialogue and mutual influence. By promoting local ownership of the projects, a basis is laid for successful and cost-effective implementation and long-term sustainability. The DF is involved in several networks, the most important ones for the Ethiopian portfolio being the Dryland Co-ordination Group (DCG) and the <b>Triangular</b> Institutional <b>Cooperation</b> Project. Much of the DF partners’ work focuses on empowering women in economic, social and political terms. The DF is broadening its range of partners to include NGOs in different ethnic and geographical contexts. It wants to support government decentralisation and to create synergies with traditional governance institutions, especially in pastoral societies. There {{is a need for}} more dialogue with partners about this strategy and about addressing human-rights issues in the specific context of Ethiopia...|$|R

It normally involves a traditional donor {{from the ranks of}} the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC), an emerging donor in the South, and a beneficiary country in the South. 1 It has received increasing international attention because of particular advantages it is said to provide. At the same time, it poses several risks that could further complicate international development coopera-tion. To make full use of its potential, it is important to con-ceive it as a learning process, to identify the interests of the three parties involved, and to apply the internationally agreed principles of aid effectiveness.

40|$|In recent decades, the International Cooperation for Development (ICD) has {{experienced}} {{alternative ways of}} implementation, integrating developed countries, developing countries and multilateral organizations in triangular arrangements. In a context of economic crisis, the limitations of ICD to promote development and the doubts on the fulfillment of the financial commitments of OECD donors, led to new roles and responsibilities for emerging economies in the international development tasks. They bet on more horizontal forms of cooperation, with approaches and practices a priori distinct from the traditional North-South Cooperation (NSC).

40|$|Background: Clinical {{training}} {{in health and}} social care educations are important {{in the development of}} professional competence. Evidence indicates that there are major quality differences in clinical practice in health- and social studies. Purpose: To examine what key players related to clinical practice in nursing and social education believes provides quality. Method: Focus Group Interview where students, supervisor and teachers participated in all groups. Results: Students learning in practice presupposes a knowledge base of the student, a learning environment with adapted responsibilities and coping capabilities, and a relationship with the supervisor who promotes both recognition and needed correction. The supervisor's role can be strengthened through individual competence, clearer support from boss and co-workers, and more emphasis on <b>triangular</b> <b>cooperation</b> with the college. Conclusion: There is a large overlap in the understanding of what in practice is all about quality. The perspectives of the three actors appear primarily as mutually complementary...|$|E
40|$|Dynamics of South-South (SSC) and <b>Triangular</b> <b>Cooperation</b> {{provided}} challenging {{interpretations and}} gained an autonomous {{space in the}} agendas of development and international cooperation’s research. Recently, we observed the emergence of critical contributions from civil society, trying to impact the development cooperation of southern countries. Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) suggest alternative principles and practices, re-appropriating their interpretations about participation, which were traditionally elaborated from northern CSOs. Nowadays, there are no structured studies describing this dynamics. This article, through the experience of civil society articulations in Brazilian SSC, tries to propitiate this research, encouraging the formulation of alternative action frames {{and the rise of}} interpretations from the South. To do so, we analyze how Brazilian CSOs try to enhance their role in formulation, implementation and accountability of Brazilian SSC. We conclude emphasizing the importance of an integral and challenging approach, allow to understand the multiple interrelations among State and Civil Societ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This thesis investigates whether South-South Cooperation {{can lead}} to {{agricultural}} growth in Africa, based on the transfer of knowledge and best-practice techniques developed in Brazil. Using a case study analysis of ProSAVANA, a <b>triangular</b> <b>cooperation</b> project between Japan, Brazil and Mozambique, this thesis analyses {{the effectiveness of the}} project in combining financial aid with technical knowledge transfer to cultivate the Nacala Corridor of Northern Mozambique. Based on the findings of the case study, this thesis argues ProSAVANA has been largely unsuccessful in achieving agricultural development in Mozambique. This is primarily due to its focus on private investment and commercial gains, which has been heavily criticised by civil society groups and local farmers in Mozambique. This paper concludes by arguing that ProSAVANA is damaging the long-term reputation of SSC, following claims of land grabbing and exploitation of resources, which is in stark contrast to its principles of shared development goals and mutual respect. This harms SSC’s chances of changing the development landscape in the long run...|$|E
40|$|Although <b>triangular</b> <b>cooperation</b> (TrC) {{between the}} European Union (EU) and Brazil in Africa {{is still in}} its early stages, recent joint action plans (2008; 2011) {{establish}} certain principles such as solidarity and local empowerment. In addition, they identify climate change, sustainable development and renewable energy as one of TrC priority areas. The recent strategic partnership between EU and Brazil for the biofuel production in Mozambique already raises many questions. The project aims to increase efficiency of bioethanol, biodiesel and bioelectricity production by intensifying agricultural production in lands of Mozambique. Currently, a feasibility study for project implementation is underway. However, many critics have been raised regarding the lack of transparency and the top down process of the project. The critics also raise awareness for the issues of environmental land degradation, food insecurity and land grabbing. Thus, {{there seems to be a}} gap between the rhetoric of the EU and Brazil about TrC principles and the reality that is emerging in Africa. Therefore, it is relevant to ask ourselves whether the TrC reflects principles of solidarity and development or respond to the interests of the « donnors »? This article will attempt to analyze the strategic and commercial interests behind this partnership. As part of the energy policy of the EU that aims to use 20 % of renewable energy by 2020, its need for biofuel is undeniable. The creation of new biofuel supply platforms in Africa, which could be acquired to minimum taxe level, is definitively in its best interests. For Brazil, the acquisition of land in Africa for biofuel production could beneficiate its national companies such as Cosan or Copersuca...|$|E
