5|$|On 14 February 1879, Chilean forces entered Antofagasta to {{the welcome}} {{of most of}} the local population, {{beginning}} the War of the Pacific against Bolivia and Peru. Many locals enlisted in the Chilean Army, and Morales enlisted as a soldier to avenge her husband by disguising herself as a man and slipping in unnoticed amid <b>the</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> patriotism.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's assassin Godse made {{no attempt}} to escape and was seized by the witnesses. He was arrested. In the weeks that followed, his {{collaborators}} were arrested as well. Godse was a Hindu nationalist with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha. They were tried in court at Delhi's Red Fort. At his trial, Godse did not deny the charges nor express any remorse. According to Claude Markovits, a French historian noted for his studies of colonial India, Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacence towards Muslims, holding Gandhi responsible for <b>the</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> violence and sufferings during the subcontinent's partition into Pakistan and India. Godse accused Gandhi of subjectivism and of acting as if only he had a monopoly of the truth. Godse was found guilty and executed in 1949.|$|E
5|$|As {{the people}} inside the church scattered, the Mouzalon {{brothers}} tried to hide: George hid under the altar, Andronikos behind a door, and Theodore in a corner by the emperor's tomb. The mob, however, proceeded to search the church for them, and George was discovered by a Latin soldier named Karoulos ("Charles"). Mouzalon was dragged from under the altar and, despite pleading to ransom his life, was executed. So great was <b>the</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> the crowd that his corpse was repeatedly stabbed and hacked to pieces, so that the parts had to be gathered in a sack for burial afterwards. Andronikos and an unnamed brother-in-law too were slain, while Theodore's fate is uncertain: some scholars believe he survived and is {{to be identified with}} Theodore Mouzalon, a chief minister to both Michael VIII and Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328). The Mouzalon family's houses were then ransacked by the mob; and when George Mouzalon's wife fled to her uncle Michael Palaiologos and pleaded for her husband's life, she was brusquely told to be quiet or she would share his fate. Palaiologos's responsibility in the whole affair is further supported by the fact that none of the Mouzalones' murderers were ever prosecuted. Indeed, the mercenary Charles appears later as Palaiologos's confidant.|$|E

5|$|Once {{rebuilding}} began, {{the poor}} rebuilt their basic {{housing in the}} same primitive fashion as before. By contrast, the wealthiest residents, both secular and spiritual, became caught in an almost manic orgy of building. Most members of the nobility had several homes in Sicily. For one thing, the Spanish viceroy spent {{six months of the}} year in Palermo and six in Catania, holding court in each city, and hence members of the aristocracy needed a town palazzo in each city. Once the palazzi in devastated Catania were rebuilt in the new fashion, the palazzi in Palermo seemed antiquated by comparison, so they too were eventually rebuilt. Following this, from the middle of the 18th century, villas to retire to in the autumn, essentially status symbols, were built at the fashionable enclave at Bagheria. This pattern was repeated, on a smaller scale, throughout the lesser cities of Sicily, each city providing a more entertaining social life and a magnetic draw for the provincial aristocrat than their country estate. The country estate also did not escape the building mania. Often Baroque wings or new façades were added to ancient castles, or country villas were completely rebuilt. Thus <b>the</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> building gained momentum until the increasingly fantastical Baroque architecture demanded by these hedonistic patrons reached its zenith in the mid-18th century.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} noted game {{during the season}} was the rematch with Iowa, which entered the game undefeated, higher-ranked, and a six-point favorite. Ohio State had lost its {{starting}} halfback, Don Clark, to a leg injury the week before, and with the discord between the coaches well-publicized, the week {{leading up to the}} game took on <b>the</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> Michigan Week. The game drew a then-record attendance in Ohio Stadium, including Vice-President of the United States Richard Nixon, and the Buckeyes beat Iowa 17–13 on a late 4th quarter drive featuring sophomore fullback Bob White. Nixon met Hayes after the game and the two became lifelong friends.|$|E
25|$|Open-air {{markets have}} flourished in Philadelphia since its founding. Growth {{of the city}} demanded more markets, and the string of open-air markets {{extending}} from the Delaware River ran for six blocks, or one full mile, prompting the main street (then called 'High Street') to be renamed 'Market Street' in 1858. Soon after the markets reached their peak growth and capacity, the public began to perceive open-air markets within the city as dirty and unhygienic. Some residents also considered <b>the</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> activity along the High/Market Street as a nuisance and traffic hazard. In 1859, city officials bowed to public pressure and dismantled all of them and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania chartered seventeen different market companies. This prompted two indoor markets to open at 12th and Market Streets, Franklin Market and Farmers' Market. These two would be {{the foundation of the}} Reading Terminal Market.|$|E

25|$|The 35th Infantry, {{stationed}} at Nogales, requested reinforcements. Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry, commanded by Lt. Col. Frederick Herman, {{came to their}} aid from Camp Stephen Little, located just north of Nogales. Herman ordered an attack {{south of the border}} to secure the Mexican hilltops overlooking the Sonoran border town. Defensive trenches and machine gun emplacements had been seen being dug on those hilltops during the previous weeks. Herman wanted his forces to occupy the position before Mexican reinforcements got there. In <b>the</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> the unexpected battle, armed Mexican civilians stormed the home of Gen. Álvaro Obregón on International Street and used its sturdy stone walls as a strongpoint from which to fire at US targets. Although the important Mexican revolutionary general (and future President) was not home, his terrified family was, and {{as a sign of the}} links between the two cities of Nogales, were personally escorted to the home of relatives on the US side by the US Consul in Nogales, Sonora, E.M. Lawton.|$|E

In his introduction to the story, Rabkin stated that it [...] "takes <b>the</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> exploration and science, paints it green, and frames it with stability." [...] He described the story as having an expansive and hopeful vision of a peaceful world, in contrast to the constant warfare of reality. In contrast, Elizabeth Cummins described the work as [...] "exploring the limits of utopia." ...|$|E

500|$|In The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway {{contrasts}} Paris with Pamplona, and <b>the</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> {{the fiesta}} with the tranquillity of the Spanish countryside. [...] Spain was Hemingway's favorite European country; he {{considered it a}} healthy place, and the only country [...] "that hasn't been shot to pieces." [...] He was profoundly affected by the spectacle of bullfighting, writing, It isn't just brutal like they always told us. It's a great tragedy—and {{the most beautiful thing}} I've ever seen and takes more guts and skill and guts again than anything possibly could. It's just like having a ringside seat at the war with nothing going to happen to you. He demonstrated what he considered the purity in the culture of bullfighting—called afición—and presented it as an authentic way of life, contrasted against the inauthenticity of the Parisian bohemians. To be accepted as an [...] aficionado was rare for a non-Spaniard; Jake goes through a difficult process to gain acceptance by the [...] "fellowship of afición." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also {{included}} in the set list of her [...] tour, being the second track performed. The singer wore a bejeweled leotard which had the Jeff Koons blue gazing ball attached in the middle; the ball was previously used in the album cover art for Artpop. Gaga accessorized the dress with a pair of feathered wings while wearing a blond bob wig reminiscent of her looks from The Fame era. Following the performance of the album title song, [...] "Artpop", Gaga loosened the wings and was joined by her dancers on the ramp to perform [...] "G.U.Y." [...] During the intermediate verses Gaga performed a choreographed routine reminiscent of the music video with a dancer. The performance ended with the singer and the dancers reaching the main stage and dancing energetically. It received positive review from Ross Raihala of St. Paul Pioneer Press who said that the song sounded [...] "terrific" [...] in its live rendition. Chuck Yarborough from The Plain Dealer noticed that Gaga sang with a backing track during the performance of [...] "G.U.Y.", but concluded that [...] "she and a gifted crew of dancers kept up a manic pace that matched <b>the</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> the evening".|$|E
2500|$|White, in death, was not spared <b>the</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> printed invective, {{which not}} only excoriated him as a man, but {{questioned}} his professional achievements as an architect, as well. The Evening Standard concluded he was “more of an artist than architect,” his work spoke of his “social dissolution.” The Nation was also critical: “…He adorned many an American mansion with irrelevant plunder.” The yellow press used lurid language to demonize White as “a sybarite of debauchery, a man who abandoned lofty enterprises for vicious revels.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The term mosh {{came into}} {{use in the}} early 1980s American {{hardcore}} scene in Washington, D.C. Early on, the dance was frequently spelled mash in fanzines and record liner notes, but pronounced mosh, as in the 1982 song [...] "Total Mash" [...] by the D.C.-based hardcore band Scream. H.R. of the band Bad Brains, regarded as a band that [...] "put moshing on the map," [...] used the term mash in lyrics and in concert stage banter to both incite and to describe the aggressive and often violent dancing of the scene. To [...] "mash it up" [...] was to go wild with <b>the</b> <b>frenzy</b> <b>of</b> the music. Due to his Jamaican-accented pronunciation of the word, fans heard this as mosh instead.|$|E
2500|$|Orlando furioso ( [...] ; <b>The</b> <b>Frenzy</b> <b>of</b> Orlando, more {{literally}} Raging Roland; in Italian furioso {{is never}} capitalized) is an Italian epic poem by Ludovico Ariosto which has exerted a wide influence on later culture.

Orlando Furioso {{is a continuation}} of Matteo Maria Boiardo's unfinished romance Orlando Innamorato ("Orlando in Love", published posthumously in 1495). [...] In its historical setting and characters, it shares some features with the Old French Chanson de Roland of the eleventh century, which tells of the death of Roland. The story is also a chivalric romance which stemmed from a tradition beginning in the late Middle Ages and continuing in popularity in the 16th century and well into the 17th.|$|E

60|$|The {{phases of}} extreme piety and extreme vice which so rapidly succeed {{one another in}} the same {{individual}} among the epileptics, are more widely separated among those who are simply insane.

Conversely, <b>the</b> <b>frenzies</b> <b>of</b> religious revivals have not unfrequently ended in gross profligacy.
