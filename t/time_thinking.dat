5|$|Khan's first {{starring}} role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays {{led to the}} 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead. In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai. This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza's television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul's miniseries Idiot (1991). Khan also played minor parts in the serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988–90), and in the English-language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989). His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style {{with those of the}} film actor Dilip Kumar, but Khan was not interested in film acting at the <b>time,</b> <b>thinking</b> that he was not good enough.|$|E

The team spent a lot of <b>time</b> <b>thinking</b> about the [...] "trifecta of characters" [...] that they needed to have in the series, and why there were uniquely interesting.

And I think for us it's always about coming into it through character". Orci stated that the series is a combination of a procedural and an [...] "extremely serialized and very culty" [...] series, quoting as examples of each, Law & Order and Lost.|$|E

[...] Spielberg said that Anderton is being punished for his previous callous unconcern for anything but the effectiveness of the PreCrime program. [...] "He's dirtied {{by the fact that he}} doesn't spend much <b>time</b> <b>thinking</b> about the moral consequences. It's just like a sporting event almost — and then suddenly that whole sporting event makes him the soccer ball." [...] His doubts about his own future lead him to examine his previous life to better understand himself according to Hall. He runs through his role in the PreCrime system, and his son's disappearance [...] "to reconstruct his past." [...] After Leo Crow in fact kills himself, Anderton becomes healed, and later has [...] "recreated himself as the subject he was previously through the knowledge that he is not a killer." [...] Although he has satisfactorily repaired his self-image, Anderton is not the same person, as he not longer believes in the PreCrime system. Hall says that Burgess' final dilemma; namely, his desire to keep PreCrime running, his inability to bring himself to kill Anderton, and his desire to live, drives him to see his only suitable action to be suicide. [...] "Burgess has been left truly alone by events," [...] argues Hall. [...] "His wife fainted when she saw the images of the murder and Anderton has been the cause of this rupture." ...|$|E
