5|$|For {{the role}} of Apu, Ray advertised in {{newspapers}} for boys of ages five to seven. None of the candidates who auditioned fulfilled Ray's expectations, but his wife spotted a boy in their neighbourhood, and <b>this</b> <b>boy,</b> Subir Banerjee, was cast as Apu. (The surname {{of three of the}} main actors happened to be Banerjee, but they were not related to each other). The hardest role to fill was the wizened old Indir. Ray eventually found Chunibala Devi, a retired stage actress living in one of Calcutta's red-light districts, as the ideal candidate. Several minor roles were played by the villagers of Boral, where Pather Panchali was filmed.|$|E

When consulted, a priestess of the Great Goddess tells Hecuba and her husband, King Priam, that the dream indicates she will birth a son who will bring destruction to Troy. Priam declares that <b>this</b> <b>boy</b> must be exposed to death, but upon his birth three days later, Priam agrees to Hecuba's pleas and has him fostered by a shepherd {{on the slopes of}} Mount Ida. Priam names the boy Alexandros (later Paris), and names his twin sister Alexandra, whom Hecuba keeps and decides to call Kassandra.|$|E

500|$|Napoleon's noble, {{moderately}} affluent background afforded him greater {{opportunities to}} study than {{were available to}} a typical Corsican of the time. In January 1779, he was enrolled at a religious school in Autun. In May, he was admitted to a military academy at Brienne-le-Château. His first language was Corsican, and he always spoke French with a marked Corsican accent and never learned to spell French properly. He was teased by other students for his accent and applied himself to reading. An examiner observed that Napoleon [...] "has always been distinguished for his application in mathematics. He is fairly well acquainted with history and geography... <b>This</b> <b>boy</b> would make an excellent sailor".|$|E
500|$|Pope Pius IX's {{determination}} to keep Edgardo {{developed into a}} strong paternal attachment. According to Edgardo's memoirs, the pontiff regularly spent time with him and played with him; the Pope would amuse the child by hiding him under his cassock and calling out: [...] "Where's the boy?" [...] At one of their meetings, Pope Pius told Edgardo: [...] "My son, you have cost me dearly, and I have suffered a great deal because of you." [...] He then said to others present: [...] "Both the powerful and the powerless tried to steal <b>this</b> <b>boy</b> from me, and accused me of being barbarous and pitiless. They cried for his parents, but they failed to recognise that I, too, am his father." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Love Story" [...] {{was highly}} {{acclaimed}} by critics upon release. Kate Kiefer of Paste magazine recognized the song to be Swift's best {{and added that}} once the lyrics are learned, {{it is impossible to}} not sing along. Sean Dooley of About.com credited the song for transitioning Swift from a [...] "fresh-faced star to crossover superstar". Dooley attributed the song's commercial success due to her departure from her past lyrical themes, which summarized [...] "I wish <b>this</b> <b>boy</b> knew how I really felt about him”. While reviewing Fearless, Dooley selected [...] "Love Story" [...] {{as one of the best}} tracks on the album. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine admired how Swift attempted to incorporate sophisticated elements, like Romeo and Juliet and The Scarlet Letter, although it was not successful because of its awkwardness, inexplicable nature, and pointless conceit. Keefe credited its success to its prominent hook. James Reed of The Boston Globe thought otherwise, stating Swift's charm was in her songwriting skills.|$|E

500|$|A year later, in January 1844, Honório Hermeto {{requested}} that PedroII dismiss the inspector of the Rio de Janeiro customs house, Saturnino de Sousa e Oliveira Coutinho, {{a younger brother}} of Aureliano Coutinho. Honório Hermeto {{had been in the}} same university class as Aureliano Coutinho and Saturnino Coutinho in Coimbra during the 1820s. However, his strained relationship with Aureliano Coutinho was not entirely the result of political rivalry between two ambitious men. Honório Hermeto nursed a sheer hatred toward him because of the role he had played both in the July 1832 coup and in the Majority movement. Honório Hermeto again pressed to have Saturnino Coutinho fired in late January, and when rebuffed yet again, said, [...] "A boy does {{not have the right to}} mock men worn out in the service of the Nation, even if <b>this</b> <b>boy</b> is the Emperor." [...] PedroII was offended and steadfastly refused to dismiss Saturnino Coutinho.|$|E
500|$|In 1341, Shuhayb and a eunuch {{entered into}} a dispute related to a pigeon racing competition, in which the eunuch mistreated Shuhayb. In response, Ahmad had the eunuch {{severely}} beaten, and when news of the incident reached an-Nasir Muhammad, the latter attempted to force Ahmad to banish Shuhayb, again sending emirs Qawsun and Bashtak to communicate his demands to Ahmad. Ahmad refused, stating to Qawsun and Bashtak that while they each had a hundred young boys and girls, he had [...] "contented" [...] himself [...] "with regard to worldly pleasures with only <b>this</b> <b>boy</b> because he has shared my exile, having left his family. How can I expel him? If the sultan commands that I do so, then let him expel me too". Ahmad was indeed expelled to Sarkhad, accompanied by Maliktamur. However, upon the intervention of some of an-Nasir Muhammad's emirs, wives and his harem, an-Nasir Muhammad decided to have Ahmad return to Cairo while Ahmad was still {{on his way to}} Sarkhad, although he first sold all of Ahmad's horses. An-Nasir Muhammad also ultimately decided to send Ahmad back to al-Karak with Maliktamur, who was also reappointed governor of Mamlakat al-Karak.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} print Hogarth {{introduces}} Tom Nero, whose surname {{may have been}} inspired by the Roman Emperor of the same name or a contraction of [...] "No hero". Conspicuous in the centre of the plate, he is shown being assisted by other boys to insert an arrow into a dog's rectum, a torture apparently inspired by a devil punishing a sinner in Jacques Callot's Temptation of St. Anthony. An initialled badge on the shoulder of his light-hued and ragged coat shows him to be a pupil of the charity school of the parish of St Giles. Hogarth used this notorious slum area as the background for many of his works including Gin Lane and Noon, part of the Four Times of the Day series. A more tender-hearted boy, perhaps the dog's owner, pleads with Nero to stop tormenting the frightened animal, even offering food in an attempt to appease him. <b>This</b> <b>boy</b> supposedly represents a young George III. His appearance is deliberately more pleasing than the scowling ugly ruffians that populate the rest of the picture, made clear in the text {{at the bottom of the}} scene: ...|$|E

500|$|The Pope {{remained}} steadfastly {{determined not}} to give Edgardo up, declaring: [...] "What I have done for <b>this</b> <b>boy,</b> I had {{the right and the}} duty to do. If it happened again, I would do the same thing." [...] When the delegation from Rome's Jewish community attended their annual meeting at the Vatican in January 1861, they were surprised to find the nine-year-old Edgardo at the pontiff's side. The new Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed a month later with Victor Emmanuel II as king. A reduced incarnation of the Papal States, comprising Rome and its immediate environs, endured outside the new kingdom because of Napoleon III's reluctance to offend his Catholic subjects by withdrawing the French garrison. He pulled these troops out following the entrance of a Jewish child from the Roman Ghetto, nine-year-old Giuseppe Coen, to the Catechumens in 1864. The removal of the French garrison brought the Roman Question to the fore in the Italian parliament. The statesman Marco Minghetti dismissed a proposed compromise whereby Rome would become part of the kingdom with the Pope retaining some special powers, saying: [...] "we cannot go to guard the Mortara boy for the Pope". The French garrison returned in 1867, following an unsuccessful attempt by Garibaldi to capture the city.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} that the writers' and directors' guide for the series was published, dated March 23, 1987, the {{character}} was named Natasha [...] "Tasha" [...] Yar. Her surname was suggested by Robert Lewin, drawing inspiration from the Babi Yar atrocities in Ukraine during the Second World War. Her biography stated that she was 28years old, and confirmed her Ukrainian descent. She was planned to have a friendship with teenager Wesley Crusher, and was described in the guide as [...] "treat <b>this</b> <b>boy</b> like the most wonderful person imaginable. Wes is the childhood friend that Tasha never had." [...] In April 1987, Lianne Langland, Julia Nickson, Rosalind Chao, Leah Ayres and Bunty Bailey were each listed as being in contention for the role. Chao was a favorite candidate, while Denise Crosby was described as [...] "the only possibility" [...] for the character of Troi. The production staff were not keen on having two actresses in the bridge crew roles with similar physical types and hair colors, and so the team took account of the casting of the two parts together. The writers and directors guide described Yar as having a muscular but very feminine body type, and being sufficiently athletic to defeat most other crew members in martial arts. After Crosby and Marina Sirtis had each auditioned for Troi and Yar respectively, Gene Roddenberry decided to switch the actresses and cast Crosby as Tasha Yar. He felt that Sirtis' appearance was better suited to the [...] "exotic" [...] Troi.|$|E
500|$|Early scenes {{animated}} by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston show that Pinocchio's design was exactly {{like that of}} a real wooden puppet with a long pointed nose, a peaked cap and bare wooden hands. Walt Disney, however, was not pleased with the work that was being done on the film. He felt that no one could really sympathize with such a character and called for an immediate halt in production. Fred Moore redesigned the character slightly to make him more appealing but the design still retained a wooden feel. Young and upcoming animator Milt Kahl felt that Thomas, Johnston and Moore were [...] "rather obsessed with the idea of <b>this</b> <b>boy</b> being a wooden puppet" [...] and felt that they should [...] "forget that he was a puppet and get a cute little boy; you can always draw the wooden joints and make him a wooden puppet afterwards". Hamilton Luske suggested to Kahl that he should demonstrate his beliefs by animating a test sequence. Kahl showed Disney a test scene in which Pinocchio is underwater looking for his father. From this scene Kahl re-envisioned the character by making him look more like a real boy, with a child's Tyrolean hat and standard cartoon character four-fingered (or three and a thumb) hands with Mickey Mouse-type gloves on them. The only parts of Pinocchio that still looked more or less like a puppet were his arms, legs and his little button wooden nose. Disney embraced Kahl's scene and immediately urged the writers to evolve Pinocchio into a more innocent, naïve, somewhat coy personality that reflected Kahl's design.|$|E
