50|$|Modulation of the {{precession}} driven insolation {{cycle is}} the primary impact of obliquity on the North African Monsoon. Evidence {{for the impact of}} obliquity on the intensity of the North African Monsoon has been found in records of dust deposits from ocean cores in the Eastern Mediterranean that occur as a result of Aeolian processes. This evidence requires complex feedback mechanisms to explain since the strongest impact of obliquity on insolation is found in the high latitudes. Two possible mechanisms for the existence of an obliquity tracer found in the Eastern Mediterranean Aeolian dust deposits have been proposed. The first of which suggests that at times of higher obliquity the temperature gradient between the poles and the equator in the southern hemisphere is greater during boreal summer (summer in the northern hemisphere). As a result of this gradient the strength of the North African Monsoon increases. A second theory that may explain the existence of an obliquity signature in the North African climate record suggests that obliquity maybe related to changes in the latitude of the tropics. The latitudinal extent of the tropics is roughly defined by the maximum wandering path of the <b>thermal</b> <b>equator.</b> An area that today is located between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer. However as the obliquity changes, the overall wandering path of the <b>thermal</b> <b>equator</b> shifts between 22.2° and 24.5° north and south. This wandering may affect the positioning of the North African Summer Monsoon Front and thus impact the perceived strength of the North African Monsoon. Further confirmation of the impacts of obliquity on the North African Monsoonal have been provided through a global fully coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice climate model, which confirmed that precession and obliquity can combine to increase precipitation in North Africa through insolation feedbacks.|$|E

40|$|The natural {{variability}} of Holocene climate defines the baseline to assess ongoing climate change. Greenland ice-core records indicate warming superimposed by abrupt climate oscillations {{in the early}} Holocene, followed by a general cooling trend throughout the middle and late Holocene that culminated during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Tropical precipitation changes correlate with these patterns throughout the Holocene. Here we use mountain glaciers in the European Alps to reconstruct the regional Holocene climate evolution and to test for a link between mid-latitude, North Atlantic, and tropical climate. Our precise 10 Be chronology from Tsidjiore Nouve Glacier, western Swiss Alps, indicates a glacier culmination during the earliest Holocene ∼ 11. 4 k. y. ago, likely related to the Preboreal Oscillation. Based on our data, no Holocene glacier advance of similar amplitude occurred until ∼ 3. 8 k. y. ago, when the glacier reached LIA limits. The 10 Be ages between 500 and 170 yr correspond to the LIA, while the youngest 10 Be ages overlap with the historically recorded post-LIA glacier positions.

40|$|Aim: Pleistocene climatic {{oscillations}} induced range {{fluctuations in}} African rain forest organisms {{and may have}} shaped species diversification through allopatric speciation events. We compared the spatial genetic structure of two forest species that live in obligate symbiosis and thus must have experienced the same range fluctuations, {{as a means to}} discriminate incipient speciation from transient differentiation simply resulting from past divergence. Location: Western central Africa. Methods: We genotyped 765 individuals of the tree Barteria fistulosa and 605 colonies of its symbiotic ant Tetraponera aethiops at 12 and 13 microsatellite loci, respectively. We compared the spatial genetic structure of the two symbionts by using Bayesian clustering algorithms, isolation-by-distance analyses and clines of synthetic alleles. We used species niche modelling (climatic and soil variables) to investigate ecological variables associated with genetic discontinuities in tree populations. Results: The trees and the ants showed congruent patterns of spatial genetic structure. However, the trees showed a very steep genetic discontinuity between groups north and south of latitude 1 ° N, which was much weaker in the ants. There was no evidence for effective gene flow between the two tree lineages in contact at the transition zone, despite the presence of a few hybrids. Niche modelling did not predict the occurrence of northern trees south of this genetic transition, and vice versa. Main conclusions: The genetic discontinuity near latitude 1 ° N is inferred to be a tension zone resulting from reproductive incompatibilities between previously allopatric tree lineages. This tension zone may have stabilized at a climatic transition (between boreal and austral seasonal regimes), and matches patterns of genetic structure previously observed in other forest plant species. Our results illustrate independent speciation between two species that live in specific and obligate symbiosis and suggest that a tension zone may separate lineages of several central African forest plants near the <b>thermal</b> <b>equator.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The north Indian Ocean {{becomes the}} warmest {{area of the}} world oceans prior to the onset of {{southwest}} monsoon in June. During this period a zonal band of high sea surface temperature (SST), the “thermal equator ” (TE), moves over this region concurrently with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Using a weekly SST data set, we show that another SST high develops off southwest India in the Lakshadweep Sea in March, well before the TE moves in to the area, and that it continues to retain its identity until the onset of monsoon. The SST high has its genesis about 6 months earlier in the Bay of Bengal. The collapse of the southwest monsoon in October and the onset of the northeast monsoon trigger downwelling coastal Kelvin waves that propagate along the periphery of the Bay of Bengal, forcing an equatorward East India Coastal Current, which brings low-salinity water from the bay to the southeastern Arabian Sea during the northeast monsoon (November–January). As the Kelvin waves propagate poleward along the west coast of India after turning around Sri Lanka, they radiate downwelling Rossby waves that produce a “high ” in sea level off southwest India. The downwelling and the surface layer of low-salinity water provide a breeding ground for the formation of a SST high in January. By March, with the increase in solar insolation due to the northward march of the Sun and the deep stable surface layer, the high reaches a mature phase clearly evident in the Lakshadweep Sea. By May, when the <b>thermal</b> <b>equator</b> and ITCZ move over the region, the high can be seen embedded in the TE. We speculate that at this time the high helps in producing conditions that are conducive for genesis of the monsoon onset vortex. 1...|$|E
40|$|Using a coupled ocean–sea ice–atmosphere {{model of}} {{intermediate}} complexity, the authors study {{the influence of}} air–sea interactions on {{the stability of the}} Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Mimicking glacial Heinrich events, a complete shutdown of the AMOC is triggered by the delivery of anomalous freshwater forcing to the northern North Atlantic. Analysis of fully and partially coupled freshwater perturbation experiments under glacial conditions shows that associated changes of the heat transport in the North Atlantic lead to a cooling north of the <b>thermal</b> <b>equator</b> and an associated strengthening of the northeasterly trade winds. Because of advection of cold air and an intensification of the trade winds, the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) is shifted southward. Changes of the accumulated precipitation lead to the generation of a positive salinity anomaly in the northern tropical Atlantic and a negative anomaly in the southern tropical Atlantic. During the shutdown phase of the AMOC, cross-equatorial oceanic surface flow is halted, preventing dilution of the positive salinity anomaly in the North Atlantic. Advected northward by the wind-driven ocean circulation, the positive salinity anomaly increases the upper-ocean density in the deep-water formation regions, thereby accelerating the recovery of the AMOC considerably. Partially coupled experiments that neglect tropical air–sea coupling reveal that the recovery time of the AMOC is almost twice as long as in the fully coupled case. The impact of a shutdown of the AMOC on the Indian and Pacific Oceans can be decomposed into atmospheric and oceanic contributions. Temperature anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere are largely controlled by atmospheric circulation anomalies, whereas those in the Southern Hemisphere are strongly determined by ocean dynamical changes and exhibit a time lag of several decades. An intensification of the Pacific meridional overturning cell in the northern North Pacific during the AMOC shutdown can be explained in terms of wind-driven ocean circulation changes acting in concert with global ocean adjustment processes. ...|$|E
40|$|Ecosystems are an {{integral}} part of climate, interacting with the atmosphere by modifying fluxes of energy, water, momentum, and carbon [...] -processes whose importance varies spatially. This dissertation focuses on the study of ecoclimate [...] unraveling the complex interactions between ecosystems and climate using a variety of tools including simple models, global scale carbon-climate models, and direct analysis of site-level data. Using a global climate model we show that transpired water vapor from expanded vegetation in the Arctic contributes greenhouse warming with a magnitude of forcing larger than that from the associated changes in albedo. This mechanism has not been considered in previous studies and here we suggest that it may negate the negative climate feedbacks expected from the surface latent cooling associated with the expansion of deciduous forest. Additionally we find that large-scale expansion of low albedo mid latitude forests in the model has the ability to increase Northern Hemisphere temperatures, moving the <b>thermal</b> <b>equator</b> northward and thus modifying global circulation patterns. We observe a northward shift of the intertropical convergence zone over Africa suggesting that extratropical vegetation may be partly responsible for the maintenance of precipitation over the Sahara inferred from proxy records of vegetation from ~ 6000 Years Ago. The ability of vegetation to effect remote circulation has implications for the role that plants may play in the current climate as well as in climates of the past and the future. In an analysis of nighttime respiration across the eddy covariance Ameriflux tower network we find a residual signal in respiration resembing seasonal variations in substrate mass after accounting for the effects of temperature and moisture. The prevalence of a mass signal indicates that allowing temperature sensitivity to change over time unphysically attributes variations in mass and moisture to changes in temperature. Using a simple carbon cycle model we show that ecosystems with long turnover times are most sensitive to long period forcing and therefore it will be harder to detect or attribute changes in these systems. This suggests that it may be easier to detect and attribute changes in the Tropics compared to the Boreal forest...|$|E
40|$|Intensification of the North and South Equatorial Current {{systems and}} trade winds {{occurred}} during glacial periods, {{according to a}} comparison of late Holocene (interglacial), 18, 000 B. P. (glacial), and late Quaternary (0 to 180, 000 B. P.) faunal assemblages and sea-surface temperature estimates from the equatorial Atlantic and Caribbean regions. Faster circulation of the North Equatorial Current system in glacial Northern Hemisphere winters (February) is indicated by increased upwelling of cool (15 °C) water off northwest Africa and slightly cooler conditions across the northern tropical Atlantic and Caribbean. Intensification of the South Equatorial Current occurred along the Equator during the Southern Hemisphere winter (August). This interpretation {{is based on the}} dominance of a cool-equatorial assemblage, which indicated that waters of 16 ° to 18 °C replaced the tropical assemblage that lives today in 24 ° to 26 °C water in this region. The cool influence of the glacial (August) Benguela-South Equatorial Current decreased rapidly westward along the equatorial belt so that the fauna was dominated by the tropical assemblage in the Caribbean. Sea-surface temperatures increased rapidly from east to west in the equatorial belt, so that at long 35 °W, the 16 °C water had reached ambient temperatures of 24 ° to 26 °C. Both faunal assemblages and temperature estimates of eight late Quaternary Atlantic and Caribbean sediment cores show that the equatorial region experienced three maximum incursions of cool Benguela Current water during the past 150, 000 yr—at approximately 135, 000 B. P., 73, 000 B. P., and 18, 000 B. P. Differences of glacial to interglacial sea-surface temperatures range from 5 ° to 10 °C in the eastern equatorial Atlantic to 2 ° to 3 °C in the western Atlantic and the Caribbean. During this time, only two periods with similar faunas and surface temperatures occurred—today and 125, 000 B. P. Seasonal temperature contrast (August to February) is three to four times greater in all cores for glacial conditions than for interglacial conditions. The winter temperatures (February {{to the north of the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>equator</b> and August south of it) show the greatest changes, and they control the overall temperature pattern. Identical temperature patterns for cores affected by the North and the South Equatorial Currents suggest that the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are generally in phase and that more severe winters control the glacial temperature pattern...|$|E

The study has examined the mechanisms of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) during austral spring and summer. The {{focus has been on}} the dynamical processes which operate on the seasonal time scales enabling predictability of the SAM. By employing concepts of wave-mean flow interactions, an observational analysis of the interconnections between tropical, extratropical and stratospheric circulations relevant for the dynamics of the SAM has been performed. Firstly, {{it has been shown that}} from mid-October until late December the persistence of the SAM is dominated by its downward coupling with the stratospheric polar vortex. Most of the year-to-year changes in the strength of this coupling are determined by the seasonal peak in the upward heat fluxes across the tropopause observed from August to mid-October and, hence, can be estimated in advance. Additional predictability of the springtime SAM arises from the pre-conditioning of the polar vortex during late autumn – early winter when its background state is conductive to upward propagating waves. Dynamical processes which underlie the stratospheric impact on the SAM have been further investigated. Secondly, it has been shown that starting from January the variability of the SAM is dominated by the impact of tropical convective systems over South America, Africa and Indonesia. Persistent variability in the latter is present throughout austral winter and spring and is related to long-lived ENSO-like variability in the Pacific Ocean. However, only upon the solstitial poleward shift of the <b>thermal</b> <b>equator</b> does it begin to affect the SAM. The sensitivity can be understood in terms of the impact of the poleward intruding subtropical highs on the propagation pathways of extratropical waves. It is then argued that the location of the subtropical boundary plays a regulating role in the summer climate system whereby the expanding tropics have enabled a stronger impact of tropical variations on the circulation of the midlatitudes. The results contribute to the growing body of evidence that tropical and stratospheric circulations can have a significant impact on midlatitude weather patterns and suggest that eliminating the model biases would help to achieve improved seasonal forecasts of the SAM.

40|$|Tropical Atlantic {{is clamped}} by the South America (the Amazon) {{in the west}} and Africa (the Sahel) in the east. These two regions have been {{undergoing}} significant climate/environment changes for decades. In order to use climate models to study the impacts of these changes, climate models {{need to be able to}} well simulate the seasonal climate of the tropical Atlantic sector. The first part of this dissertation focuses on the representation of the seasonal cycle in the CCSM 3 coupled atmosphere-ocean model. CCSM 3 SST has a north-south dipole pattern of bias centered at the latitude of the <b>thermal</b> <b>equator,</b> resembling the observed pattern of interannual climate variability in boreal spring. Along the equator in boreal spring CCSM 3 exhibits striking westerly winds at the surface, reminiscent of the pattern of climate variability in boreal summer. The westerly winds cause deepening of the eastern thermocline that keeps the east warm despite enhanced coastal upwelling. Next, a comparison is made with a simulation using historical SST to force the atmospheric model (CAM 3) in order to deduce information about the origin of bias in CCSM 3. The patterns of bias in CAM 3 resemble that in CCSM 3, indicating that the source of the bias in CCSM 3 may be traced to difficulties in the atmospheric model. The next chapter presents a modeling study of the origin of the westerly wind bias CAM 3 by using a steady-state linearized atmospheric model. The results indicate that underestimation of rainfall over the eastern Amazon region can lead to the westerly bias in equatorial Atlantic surface winds. They suggest that efforts to reduce coupled model biases, especially seasonal ones, must target continental biases, even in the deep Tropics where ocean-atmosphere interaction generally rules. The fourth chapter investigates the relationship between the two predominate modes of Tropical Atlantic interannual variability. The leading modes of Tropical Atlantic SST variability in boreal spring and summer are shown to be related, with the spring meridional mode leading into summer equatorial mode. The presence of a meridional mode with warm SST anomalies in the southern tropics in spring leads to a warm phase equatorial mode in summer, and vice-versa. This modal linkage occurs independently of climate variability in other ocean basins (e. g., ENSO). Atmospheric diabatic heating associated with a meridional shift of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone plays an important role in this relationship. The identification of this relationship enhances the prospects for prediction of boreal summer rainfall over the Guinea Coast of equatorial Africa...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 In {{order to}} {{understand}} the atmospheric branch of the earth's hydrologic cycle on the global scale, an atmospheric moisture balance is diagnostically analyzed from the January and July data of the OSU atmospheric general circulation model, which has been integrated for thirty-nine months of simulation with seasonally-varying sea-surface temperature and solar insolation. The model hydrologic processes analyzed for the balance include the surface evaporation, the precipitation by large-scale and cumulus condensation, the vertical transport by large-scale and cumulus mass fluxes, and the horizontal transport of water vapor. The large-scale transports include the contributions from the standing and transient components of motion. Also analyzed are the potential and stream functions of horizontal transport, and the statistics of seasonal and interannual variabilities of the global and hemispheric effects of the hydrologic processes. As a result of these analyses, the hydrologic cycle is constructed and understood for both January and July of the model. Large-scale vertical transport moistens the upper layer; the standing and transient motions contribute mostly in the tropics and higher latitudes, respectively. Large-scale horizontal transport moistens the continental atmosphere except for the relatively small transport from the continents to the oceans by the standing motion in the upper layer; the runoff occurs in the model to balance the marine transport but seasonal trends exist such that snow assumulates during January and melts during July on the global average. Cumulus convection drys not only the lower layer but also the upper layer of the model, and the penetrating cumuli are a major mechanism of maritime precipitation, whereas the large-scale condensation and penetrating cumuli have the dominating effect on the continental precipitation during January and July, respectively. The seasonal precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere continents concurs with strong surface evaporation in summer and also with strong cyclonic activity in winter. Comparison with other models and observational data indicates that the model reproduced some basic features of the atmospheric branch of the hydrologic cycle and its seasonal variation. The intense evaporation (≥ 5 mm day⁻¹) over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and the rain belts in the tropics are well simulated for both January and July. The poleward transport in the northern middle and high latitudes is in good agreement with observations. The maximum toward-thermal-equator transport in the tropics occurs, however, at the geographic equator for both January and July, indicating that these maxima are about 5 degrees of latitude closer to the seasonal <b>thermal</b> <b>equator</b> than the observed maxima. Nevertheless the global statistics of the model atmosphere are not significantly {{different from that of the}} real atmosphere. Among others, we mention the following common features of the January and July moisture balances in the present model. Most precipitation of penetrating convection occurs in regions of strong surface evaporation even though some occurs in the moisture convergence zones where most of heavy mid-level convection is located. In the regions of intense penetrating convection, however, the standing part of surface evaporation is much larger in magnitude than the negative transient part which is essentially due to the positive correlation between the turbulence intensity and surface humidity over wet surfaces. Moreover, the horizontal structure of the standing part conforms to that of the standing vapor pressure difference between the air and the underlying surface. A strategy for further studies is recommended on the basis of our understanding of these features...|$|E
