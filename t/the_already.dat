5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Austria-Hungary in World War I and the Treaty of Rapallo of 1920, Rijeka became an {{independent}} city-state known as the Free State of Fiume. That {{marked the beginning of}} the port's decline, as it lost a large portion of its major market, Hungary. Italy annexed Rijeka in 1924 by the Treaty of Rome, and the port became peripherally located, with no modern railway or road links to the rest of the country, further adding to <b>the</b> <b>already</b> obvious economic decline.|$|E
5|$|After {{the work}} {{stoppage}} at pit number six, more white miners assembled near the town. They marched to Rock Springs {{by way of}} the railroad, carrying firearms. At about 10:00a.m., the bell in the Knights of Labor meeting hall tolled, and the miners inside the building joined <b>the</b> <b>already</b> large group. There were white miners who opted to go to saloons instead of joining the gathering mob, but by 2:00p.m., the saloons and grocers were persuaded by a Union Pacific official to close.|$|E

5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought <b>the</b> <b>already</b> established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E

Many of these anti-tank islands were established along <b>the</b> <b>already</b> constructed stop lines, where existing defences could {{be integrated into the}} new strategy and, especially, at towns and villages where there was a Home Guard to provide personnel.|$|E

Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe, replied that <b>the</b> <b>already</b> overburdened German aircraft industry could not possibly complete the design, testing and mass production of such aircraft before 1946. Instead, he proposed converting existing aircraft (again the Junkers Ju 87 and Messerschmitt Bf 109) as a temporary solution until newer types could be developed. Training of carrier pilots at Travemünde would also resume.|$|E
