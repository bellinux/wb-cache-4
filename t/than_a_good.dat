The locomotive was utilised on services from London Liverpool Street to Norwich, Clacton, and Harwich.

Maintenance was initially undertaken at Crewe Works, but responsibility was transferred to Cowlairs Works in the spring of 1958. [...] More varied work was allocated to them as their reliability improved, including working portions of the Thames-Clyde Express and the Queen of Scots Pullman.
