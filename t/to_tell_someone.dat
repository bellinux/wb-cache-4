According to the source, around $93 million was raised. She spoke out in relation to the cause, saying: [...] "Finding the courage <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> about being abused {{is one of the most}} difficult decisions a child will ever have to make." [...] In 2010 and 2012, she was involved in supporting the AIDS Support Gala, which was held by the American Foundation for Aids Research (Amfar).|$|E
500|$|During {{and after}} {{each of the}} {{role-playing}} scenes, Harris and the children discuss the situation and what the child should do. Harris tells the children not to be afraid <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> {{if they have been}} improperly touched, saying, [...] "Some people don't act right with kids, and they need help. You can't protect them from trouble that they themselves have caused, and it's better to say something so that you and the family can get the help you need. You know nothing gets better by keeping quiet about it." [...] Harris says that, if it is difficult to explain where they have been touched, they can draw a picture or point to the place on a doll. The film ends with [...] "My Body" [...] sung by a group of people including Harris, two police officers, and some children.|$|E

50|$|Verbal self-defense {{experts have}} widely varying {{definitions}} {{of what it}} is and how it is applied. These include everything from a person simply saying no to someone else or repeatedly refusing a request <b>to</b> <b>telling</b> <b>someone</b> who has violated a personal boundary what they want. It could even entail a more complicated scenario in which a person is called on to refuse to engage verbally with someone manipulative, to set limits, and to end the conversation.|$|R

2500|$|The {{number of}} auditioners {{increased}} significantly after {{the success of}} the Season 1, and arenas and stadia started to be used to hold the first auditions from this season onwards when the Rose Bowl in Pasadena was used this season instead of the hotel originally planned. [...] Around 70,000 attended the auditions this season and 234 were selected to proceed on to the Hollywood round.

[...] Paula Abdul was absent from the Atlanta audition.|$|E
2500|$|After the United States {{abolished}} slavery, Garrison {{announced in}} May 1865 {{that he would}} resign {{the presidency of the}} American Anti-Slavery Society and offered a resolution declaring victory in the struggle against slavery and dissolving the society. The resolution prompted sharp debate, however, led by his long-time friend Wendell Phillips, who argued that the mission of the AAS was not fully completed until black Southerners gained full political and civil equality. Garrison maintained that while complete civil equality was vitally important, the special task of the AAS was at an end, and that the new task would best be handled by new organizations and new leadership. With his long-time allies deeply divided, however, he was unable to muster the support he needed to carry the resolution, and it was defeated 118–48. Declaring that his [...] "vocation as an Abolitionist, thank God, has ended," [...] Garrison resigned the presidency and declined an appeal to continue. Returning home to Boston, he withdrew completely from the AAS and ended publication of The Liberator at the end of 1865. With Wendell Phillips at its head, the AAS continued to operate for five more years, until ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution granted voting rights to black men. (According to Henry Mayer, Garrison was hurt by the rejection, and remained peeved for years; [...] "as the cycle came around, always managed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> {{that he was not going}} to the next set of [...] meetings" [...]) ...|$|E

5000|$|Frida is {{best friend}} with Christoffer, whose father is policeman. One day she becomes friend with Isabell who {{moves to the}} city, and Isabell wants her {{to go with her}} and smoke without that someone knows it, but then {{suddenly}} it burns at the deserted croft and Frida and Isabell believe that it's their fault.

60|$|Sometimes he {{made what}} George Edmund {{regarded}} as quite footling comments. Still George Edmund had <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> {{and there was}} no one else to tell. So George Edmund went on talking and Mr. Brumley went on thinking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely so. Think of her position, left as she {{is without}} a mother! It was {{incumbent}} on her <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>someone.</b> There was, however, one other person in whom {{it would have been}} much better that she should have confided." ...|$|E
60|$|Half-way {{down the}} stairs, it {{suddenly}} occurred to Mr. Bennett {{that he wanted}} to sing. He wanted to sing very loud, and for quite some time. He restrained the impulse, and returned to bed. But relief such as his was too strong to keep bottled up. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> all about it. He needed a confidant.|$|E
50|$|Email has to {{go through}} {{potentially}} untrustworthy intermediate computers (email servers, ISPs) before reaching its destination, {{and there is no way}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if it was accessed by an unauthorized entity. This is different from a letter sealed in an envelope, where, by close inspection of the envelope, it might be possible <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if <b>someone</b> opened it. In that sense, an email is much like a postcard whose contents are visible to everyone who handles it.|$|R
50|$|Nygma reveals to Kringle {{during a}} visit that he accidentally killed her ex-boyfriend, Dougherty. When she tries <b>to</b> leave and <b>tell</b> <b>someone,</b> he holds her and tries {{to keep her from}} screaming, but he unknowingly {{strangles}} her and she dies in his arms, leaving him shouting and crying in grief.|$|R
5000|$|Professor of neuropsychology Barbara Sahakian qualifies, [...] "A lot of neuroscientists in {{the field}} are very {{cautious}} and say we can't talk about reading individuals' minds, and right now that is very true, but we're moving ahead so rapidly, it's not going to be that long before we will be able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether <b>someone's</b> making up a story, or whether someone intended to do a crime with a certain degree of certainty." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{measured}} {{me for a}} moment. [...] "No {{doubt it}} is very absurd. You will not believe me even when I tell you, {{so that it is}} fairly safe to tell you.

I make diamonds." ...|$|E
60|$|He felt {{he wanted}} to confirm and {{establish}} this new resolution, to go right away to Labrador for a year. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> the thing definitely. He would have gone downstairs again to Marjorie, but she was submerged and swimming desperately against the voluble rapids of Aunt Plessington's purpose. It might be an hour before that attack withdrew. Presently there would be other callers. He decided to have tea {{with his mother and}} talk to her about this new break {{in the course of his}} life.|$|E
60|$|So Unc' Billy Possum went one way, and Jimmy Skunk went another way. And {{everyone}} {{they told}} hurried <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> else.

He also sang frequently with a karaoke machine at Cooper's Emporium and the Old Roan pub near the home he shared with his mother when the Searchers first started. Many of his audience {{had no idea who}} he was, but he had kept his skill and delighted <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> of <b>someone</b> stopping him in the supermarket to say how much they had liked his singing at the Old Roan.|$|R

50|$|Rembrandt ran a large {{workshop}} and had many pupils. The list of Rembrandt pupils from his period in Leiden {{as well as}} his time in Amsterdam is quite long, mostly because his influence on painters around him was so great that it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether <b>someone</b> worked for him in his studio or just copied his style for patrons eager to acquire a Rembrandt. A partial list should include Ferdinand Bol,Adriaen Brouwer,Gerrit Dou,Willem Drost,Heiman Dullaart,Gerbrand van den Eeckhout,Carel Fabritius,Govert Flinck,Hendrick Fromantiou,Aert de Gelder,Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten,Abraham Janssens,Godfrey Kneller,Philip de Koninck,Jacob Levecq,Nicolaes Maes,Jürgen Ovens,Christopher Paudiß,Willem de Poorter,Jan Victors, andWillem van der Vliet.|$|R
5000|$|Toph Beifong (voiced by Jessie Flower), a twelve-year-old blind female Earthbending prodigy, and Aang's Earthbending instructor. Being blind, Toph [...] "sees" [...] by feeling {{vibrations}} in {{the ground}} through her feet using Earthbending. This ability also enables her to feel the pulses of one's heart, allowing her <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if <b>someone</b> is lying. She is later shown developing a method of 'Metalbending' by detecting impurities in the metal. She was strictly taught only the basics of Earthbending by a tutor but learned its original form from badger-moles, the original Earthbenders. Toph also has a crush on Sokka.|$|R

5000|$|The {{imperative}} mood expresses direct commands, requests, and prohibitions. In many circumstances, {{using the}} imperative mood may sound blunt or even rude, {{so it is}} often used with care. Example: [...] "Paul, do your homework now". An imperative is used <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>someone</b> to do something without argument.|$|E

30|$|During {{the past}} decades, various {{mathematical}} {{models for the}} propagation of a rumor within a population have been developed. Beyond obvious qualitative parallels there are also important differences between the spread of rumor and diseases. In this paper, we apply models {{similar to those used}} in epidemiology to the spread of rumor. By the term ‘rumor’, we refer generally to any concept that can be transmitted from person to person. It may refer to uncertain information, which may require efforts and apprenticeship to be learned. What is important is that it is possible <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if <b>someone</b> has adopted the rumor, believed it, and is capable of and/or active in spreading it to others.|$|R
50|$|With {{the help}} of Amanda Holden the series offers a {{platform}} {{for people who are}} desperate <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> something <b>to</b> <b>someone.</b> It gives an insight into others lives and emotions, as they tell their loved ones something they have been putting off for a while.
