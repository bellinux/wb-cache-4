5|$|In the 1921–22 season, {{the club}} {{achieved}} a clean sweep {{of all the}} domestic competitions they entered – the Irish League, Irish Cup, County Antrim Shield, Alhambra Cup, Belfast Charity Cup, Gold Cup and the City Cup. The club followed this up the next season by winning a treble including the Irish League, Irish Cup and County Antrim Shield in 1922–23. In 1927, Joe Bambrick signed for the Blues, and {{would become one of}} the club's all-time top goal scorers. In the 1929–30 season, Bambrick scored a remarkable 94 goals – a record that surprisingly stood for only one season, until Glentoran's Fred Roberts scored an incredible 96 goals during the following campaign to break Bambrick's record. In 1930, Bambrick scored six goals in one game for Ireland – a 7–0 win over Wales. The 1931–32, 1933–34 and 1934–35 league titles followed for Linfield, before Bambrick left the club to join Chelsea in 1935 having scored 286 league goals in just 183 games for Linfield – a remarkable ratio of 1.56 goals per game. The Irish League was once again suspended in 1940 {{as a result of the}} Second World War, with another temporary unofficial league set up which was called the Northern Regional League. Linfield won <b>this</b> <b>league</b> three times – in 1942–43, 1944–45 and 1945–46. <b>This</b> <b>league</b> ran for seven seasons until the return of the Irish League once again in 1947.|$|E

In 1897 Eastville Rovers joined the Birmingham and District League, and for two seasons played in both <b>this</b> <b>league</b> and the Western League. At the beginning of the 1897–98 season, the club turned professional and changed its name to Bristol Eastville Rovers, and on 17 February 1899 the name was officially changed to Bristol Rovers. In 1899 Bristol Rovers joined the newly formed Southern League, where they remained until 1920, winning the league title along the way in 1905.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} tracks {{included}} in the game, with locations inspired {{from different parts of}} the globe, from Belize to Tokyo. Progression through the game is achieved by competing in and winning races against computer-controlled racers spread over different tracks and in different leagues. Players begin in the Rookie league, across three of the tracks, where the chances of detachment from the race surface are decreased and rates of acceleration reduced. Success in the Rookie league unlocks the less forgiving Pro league with more tracks on which to compete. Further success unlocks the most difficult league, the Ballistics league, competition in <b>this</b> <b>league</b> occurs across every track and to complete this, the player must place first in every race.|$|E

Thus, by its second year, the original NLL was playing in all major league arenas: the Colisée de Québec, the Montreal Forum, the Boston Garden, Nassau Coliseum, the Spectrum, and the Capital Centre. When the two wealthier '75 NLL franchises, Philadelphia and Maryland, finished out of the playoffs, and with Montreal losing access to the fabled Montreal Forum in the upcoming season due to the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games, the league folded after two seasons due to financial uncertainty.|$|E

For this, they were demoted to Division 2 Södra; several players and members of staff were banned. Malmö FF won the Division 2 Södra title at the first attempt, but failed to win the play-offs which decided promotion back to Allsvenskan.
