Around 70% of TRT's funding comes from a <b>tax</b> levied <b>on</b> electricity <b>bills</b> and a license <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> television and radio receivers. As these are hypothecated taxes, {{as opposed to the}} money coming from general government funds, the principle {{is similar to that of}} the television licence levied in a number of other countries.

50|$|Shafer {{supported}} Sonny Perdue for Governor, endorsing him, {{contributing to}} his campaigns and making speeches on his behalf. He also served briefly {{as one of}} Perdue's floor leaders in the Senate. However, the two disagreed on budgetary issues. Shafer opposed Perdue's 2003 package of proposed excise and property tax increases, voting against even a scaled back version that only raised tobacco taxes. He also opposed Perdue's 2010 proposed <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> hospital <b>bills,</b> insisting that it be coupled with reductions in income and insurance premium taxes. Also, Shafer introduced zero-based budgeting legislation over Perdue's objections. When Shafer won passage of zero based budgeting in 2010 with Senate Bill 1, Perdue vetoed it. Shafer successfully moved to override Perdue's veto during the 2011 legislative session.|$|R

The tax led in the 1880s and 1890s to the creation and adoption of checking accounts. By the 1890s, 90% of the money supply was in checking accounts. State banking had made a comeback.|$|R

2500|$|Negative {{interest}} rates have been proposed in the past, notably in the late 19th century by Silvio Gesell. A negative interest rate can be described (as by Gesell) as a [...] "tax on holding money"; he proposed it as the Freigeld (free money) component of his Freiwirtschaft (free economy) system. To prevent people from holding cash (and thus earning 0%), Gesell suggested issuing money for a limited duration, after which it must be exchanged for new bills; attempts to hold money thus result in it expiring and becoming worthless. Along similar lines, John Maynard Keynes approvingly cited {{the idea of a}} carrying <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> money, (1936, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money) but dismissed it due to administrative difficulties. More recently, a carry <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> currency was proposed by a Federal Reserve employee (Marvin Goodfriend) in 1999, to be implemented via magnetic strips <b>on</b> <b>bills,</b> deducting the carry tax upon deposit, the <b>tax</b> being based <b>on</b> how long the bill had been held.|$|R
