40|$|To help {{understand}} how the tif- 1 mutation of the recA gene of Escherichia coli confers adenine activability on the recA protein, we used the fact that cytidine plus guanosine inhibits induction of prophage lambda and cell filamentation in a tif- 1 mutant, and that adenine reverses this inhibition. We varied the amount of adenine in agar plates containing a fixed amount of cytidine and scored for survivors of three different tif-dependent lethal induction processes. Much more adenine was required for cell killing when cytidine was present than when it was absent. Therefore adenine does not override cytidine inhibition, but instead appears to compete with it for a site of action which {{may be on the}} recA protein. The competition is not at the cell transport level. Our results lead to a model in which the <b>tif</b> <b>form</b> of the recA protein is an allosteric enzyme that binds both negative and positive modulators. By varying the adenine-cytidine ratio of the medium it is possible to control the degree of induction in a tif- 1 cell. For the three different tif-dependent inductions studied here, least adenine was required for lambda induction and most for lethal filamentation, presumably reflecting requirements for different amounts of activated recA protein in each process. Varying the adenine-cytidine ratio revealed two stable intermediate stages in lambda induction, as well as a stage of colicin E 1 induction in which the cells produced colicin without cell death. The rate of filament formation could be similarly controlled. Experiments with tif (ColE 1, lambda) gave evidence of a competition between colicin repressor and lambda repressor for activated recA protein...|$|E

40|$|Reactivity of pure {{molecular}} fluorine F 2 {{allows the}} creation of new materials with unique electrochemical properties. We demonstrate that titanium oxyfluoride TiOF 2 can be obtained under molecular fluorine from anatase titanium oxide TiO 2, while the fluorination of rutile TiO 2 leads only to pure fluoride <b>form</b> <b>TiF</b> 4. Contrary to most fluorides, TiOF 2 is air-stable and hydrolyses poorly in humid conditions. Such stability makes it possible for TiOF 2 to be studied as an electrode material in Li-ion secondary batteries systems. It shows capacities as high as 220 mAh g− 1 and good cyclability at high current rates at an average potential of 2. 3 V vs Li+/Li. At such a potential, only Li+ insertion occurs, as proven by in operando XRD/electrochemistry experiments...|$|R

40|$|The interstitium, {{situated}} {{between the}} blood and lymph vessels and the cells, consists of a solid or matrix phase and a fluid phase representing the tissue microenvironment. In the present review, {{we focus on the}} interstitial fluid phase of solid tumors, the tumor interstitial fluid (TIF), i. e., the fluid bathing the tumor and stroma cells, also including immune cells. This is a component of the internal milieu of a solid tumor that has attracted regained attention. Access to this space may provide important insight into tumor development and therapy response. <b>TIF</b> is <b>formed</b> by transcapillary filtration, and since this fluid is not readily available we discuss available techniques for TIF isolation, results from subsequent characterization and implications of recent findings with respect to fluid filtration and uptake of macromolecular therapeutic agents. There appear to be local gradients in signaling substances from neoplastic tissue to plasma that may provide new understanding of tumor biology. The development of sensitive proteomic technologies has made TIF a valuable source for tumor specific proteins and biomarker candidates. Potential biomarkers will appear locally in high concentrations in tumors and may eventually be found diluted in the plasma. Access to TIF that reliably reflects the local tumor microenvironment enables identification of substances {{that can be used in}} early detection and monitoring of disease...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{previous}} studies transcriptional intermediary factor 1 alpha (TIF 1 alpha) {{was identified as}} a direct binding partner and potential transcriptional coactivator for nuclear receptors (NRs) but its overexpression inhibited, rather than enhanced, transcriptional activation by NRs. Here we show that TIF 1 alpha bound to and enhanced the function of the C-terminal activation domain (AD) of coactivator associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM 1) and the N-terminal AD of glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP 1). Furthermore, although TIF 1 alpha had little or no NR coactivator activity by itself, it cooperated synergistically with GRIP 1 and CARM 1 to enhance NR-mediated transcription. Inhibition of endogenous TIF 1 alpha expression reduced transcriptional activation by the GRIP 1 N-terminal domain but not by the CARM 1 C-terminal domain, suggesting that TIF 1 alpha may be more important for mediating the activity of the former than the latter. Reduction of endogenous TIF 1 alpha levels also compromised the androgen-dependent induction of an endogenous target gene of the androgen receptor. Finally, <b>TIF</b> 1 alpha <b>formed</b> a ternary complex with the GRIP 1 N-terminal and CARM 1 C-terminal domains. Thus, we conclude that TIF 1 alpha cooperates with NR coactivators GRIP 1 and CARM 1 by forming a stable ternary complex with them and enhancing the AD function of one or both of them...|$|R
30|$|AD-derived BTO {{thin films}} are etched by sulfur hexafluoride ICP technology. The AFM images {{show that the}} {{roughness}} of the etched surface becomes rugged {{in comparison with the}} as-deposited surface because of the generation of the fluoride. After the post-annealing treatment, cross grain boundary diffusion becomes significant and the crystallite size grows, which caused a poor surface smoothness when compared with that of the other samples. The chemical compositions and bonding states for each BTO sample were studied by XPS. The low-volatility compound BaF 2 was observed after the etching process and is due to a chemical reaction with F* after the destruction of O bonds via ion bombardment. Thus, the Ti-O bonds are destroyed by chemical reaction and the products of <b>TiF</b> 4 are <b>formed,</b> and all of these residues could be removed by post-annealing process. The XRD studies indicated that the BTO thin films are well crystallized and have a preferred orientation of (100) after post-annealing process, which help to improve the dielectric properties. The post-annealed BTO thin films exhibit higher dielectric constant and lower dielectric loss compared to the as-deposited ones, which is important for practical device applications. This result leads {{to the conclusion that the}} post-annealing process is a cost-effective and appropriate method for both effectively removing etching by-products and obtaining nanocrystalline films, which plays an important role on the disposal of etching residue and dielectric characteristics of BTO thin films.|$|R
40|$|An On-line Technology Information System (OTIS) is {{currently}} being developed for the Advanced Life Support (ALS) Program. This paper describes the preliminary development of OTIS, which is a system designed to provide centralized collection and organization of technology information. The lack of thorough, reliable and easily understood technology information is a major obstacle in effective assessment of technology development progress, trade studies, metric calculations, and technology selection for integrated testing. OTIS will provide a formalized, well-organized protocol to communicate thorough, accurate, current and relevant technology information between the hands-on technology developer and the ALS Community. The need {{for this type of}} information transfer system within the Solid Waste Management (SWM) element was recently identified and addressed. A SWM Technology Information <b>Form</b> (<b>TIF)</b> was developed specifically for collecting detailed technology information in the area of SWM. In the TIF, information is requested from SWM technology developers, based upon the Technology Readiness Level (TRL). Basic information is requested for low-TRL technologies, and more detailed information is requested as the TRL of the technology increases. A comparable form is also being developed for the wastewater processing element. In the future, similar forms will also be developed for the ALS elements of air revitalization, food processing, biomass production and thermal control. These ALS element-specific forms will be implemented in OTIS via a web-accessible interface,with the data stored in an object-oriented relational database (created in MySQLTM) located on a secure server at NASA Ames Research Center. With OTIS, ALS element leads and managers will be able to carry out informed research and development investment, thereby promoting technology through the TRL scale. OTIS will also allow analysts to make accurate evaluations of technology options. Additionally, the range and specificity of information solicited will help educate technology developers of programmatic needs...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims There is {{evidence}} that people with intellectual disabilities experience {{a higher rate of}} traumatic life events. However, attempts to research the presence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology have been hampered by the absence of a validated and suitable assessment tool. The aim of this study, therefore, was to further examine the psychometric properties of a recently developed measure, the Lancaster and Northgate Trauma Scales (LANTS; Wigham, Hatton & Taylor, 2011 b). Method Using a correlational design, 40 individuals (23 female, 17 male) with a mild intellectual disability (Mean FSIQ = 60. 68; SD = 6. 13) completed the LANTS and measures of anxiety and depression, along with a measure of general intellectual functioning. Two assessment tools developed for this study were also administered: the Impact of Events Scale – Intellectual Disabilities (IES-ID), a version of the Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R; Weiss & Marmar, 1997) adapted specifically for people with intellectual disabilities; and the Trauma Information <b>Form</b> (<b>TIF)</b> which is a selfreport assessment of trauma experiences in line with current DSM-IV-TR criteria (2000). Results Both trauma scales had high internal and test-retest reliability, although the IESID subscales were less reliable than the total severity score. Convergent validity was also good with the LANTS and IES-ID both positively correlated with each other, and iii measures of anxiety and depression. However, unlike the IES-ID, the LANTS failed to correlate with the number of traumas. No differences on trauma or demographic factors were found between a high and low PTSD group. Intellectual functioning was not related to the extent of trauma symptomatology. Conclusions The LANTS and IES-ID are promising trauma assessment tools, and therefore both may have clinical utility for the identification of PTSD symptomatology in people with intellectual disabilities. While the findings should be extended to a larger sample, they clearly provide a basis for more research into this under-researched but burgeoning area...|$|R
