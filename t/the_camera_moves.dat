5|$|The {{game has}} been called both a {{platform}} game and an action-adventure game. GameSpot asserts that it combines elements of ToeJam & Earl and its platformer sequel, ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron, while GameNOW and Electronic Gaming Monthly liken it to the former game. The game features both single- and two-player modes; in both, players control {{one of the three}} protagonists. ToeJam moves quickly and jumps high, but has weak attacks; Earl is tougher and has more powerful attacks, but is slow and jumps lower than ToeJam; Latisha ranks between the two in terms of athleticism, and gains additional power-ups later in the game. In the game's two-player mode, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> between single and split-screen as players maneuver their characters away from each other. Characters can share power-ups when in close proximity.|$|E
5|$|The series' title {{sequence}} {{was created}} by production studio Elastic for HBO. Creative director Angus Wall and his collaborators received the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Main Title Design for the sequence, which depicts a three-dimensional map of the series' fictional world. The map is projected {{on the inside of}} a sphere which is centrally lit by a small sun in an armillary sphere. As <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> across the map, focusing on the locations of the episode's events, clockwork mechanisms intertwine and allow buildings and other structures to emerge from the map. Accompanied by the title music, the names of the principal cast and creative staff appear. The sequence concludes after about 90 seconds with the title card and brief opening credits indicating the episode's writer(s) and director. Its composition changes as the story progresses, with new locations replacing those featuring less prominently or not at all.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde Spears sitting and {{laughing}} in a bar with two female friends, but stops {{to look at a}} brunette Spears calling out to her on a small stage in front of them, wearing a leather vest, a studded belt, panties and fishnet stockings while sporting a tattoo on her biceps. She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance and flip her hair while special effects lights flash around her as <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> slightly in and out of focus to the beat of the song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also dance around the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive man sitting with his friends at a table across the bar.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} a coin dropped onto ground after which a title card that reads Roberts' name and the track title is shown. As the title changes color, Roberts walks and skips down a New York City street wearing a floral T-shirt dress. Effects are placed on Roberts' with sperm cells graffitied on it shadow her {{movement}} with neon colors and throughout becomes increasingly prominent, and during the second verse Roberts performs a short dance movement with two back-up dancers before she walks past a wall with sperm graffitied on it, which also changes to multiple neon colours. As the video progresses, Roberts interacts with buildings and objects, such as New York style newspaper dispensers and following this her entire body has effects placed upon it as she changes color and shades and the last frames of the video show {{more of the same}} effects and finally shows a frame of a New York street with Roberts walking out of the frame before <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> upwards to show a purple sky.|$|E
5|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence of The Wind Will Carry Us. From the outset, Kiarostami formulates a dialectical {{relationship between}} image and sound. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> from long shots of the Land Rover winding {{its way through the}} mountain paths to extreme close-ups of the film’s protagonist. Concurrently, Kiarostami aurally represents an expanse that extends far beyond what the viewer can see at any moment, even when the camera remains a considerable distance from the subject matter on-screen. Kiarostami establishes numerous spaces beyond the visual field by fragmenting his soundtrack to include other sounds such as birds singing, dogs barking and electronic devices such as cell phones and radios blaring in the distance. By referring to characters the viewer does not see or hear, Kiarostami widens the scope of his films.|$|E
5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E
2500|$|Filming {{lasted for}} 12 or 13 weeks, the longest {{shooting}} time {{of any of}} Resnais's films.

500|$|All Captain Scarlet episodes, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the pilot episode, incorporate two sets of opening titles.

500|$|The opening title {{sequence}} itself {{begins with}} a deck of Tarot cards falling into the sand, while <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> in and enters one card into a separate world presenting layers of artwork and footage from iconic moments of the American Depression era; the camera then moves back out of a different card and repeats the procedure several times.

500|$|Kurosawa's {{style is}} marked by a number of devices and {{techniques}} which Kurosawa introduced in his films over the decades. In his films of the 1940s and 1950s, Kurosawa frequently employs the [...] "axial cut", in which <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> closer to, or further away from, the subject, not through the use of tracking shots or dissolves, but through a series of matched jump cuts. Another stylistic trait which scholars have pointed out is Kurosawa's tendency to [...] "cut on motion": that is, to edit a sequence of a character or characters in motion so that an action is depicted in two or more separate shots, rather than one uninterrupted shot.|$|E
500|$|A man (Henry Ian Cusick) {{wakes up}} from his bunk bed and {{immediately}} presses a few keys on {{what appears to be}} a late 1970s-era computer. He then gets dressed, and begins his day as <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> about the surrounding rooms, which contain an assortment of objects from the 1960s to the present. He puts on some music, begins an exercise routine, has a shower, makes himself some breakfast, and injects himself with a vaccine. He is interrupted by an explosion, spurring the man to arm himself before using a telescope-and-mirror system. His gaze reveals the faces of Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) standing around the now-open [...] shaft.|$|E
2500|$|It was an {{incredible}} camera setup. We rehearsed two days. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> followed Greenstreet and Bogart from one room into another, then down a long hallway and finally into a living room; there <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moved</b> {{up and down in}} what is referred to as a boom-up and boom-down shot, then panned from left to right and back to Bogart's drunken face; the next pan shot was to Greenstreet's massive stomach from Bogart's point of view. ...

50|$|Pinhole cameras can be {{constructed}} with a sliding film holder or back so {{the distance between the}} film and the pinhole can be adjusted.This allows the angle of view of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> to be changed and also the effective f-stop ratio of <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> <b>Moving</b> <b>the</b> film closer to the pinhole will result in a wide angle field of view and a shorter exposure time.Moving the film farther away from the pinhole will result in a telephoto or narrow angle view and a longer exposure time.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2008, U.S. Representative Chris Carney, {{chairman}} of the House Homeland Security Committee’s Management, Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee, said the system [...] "works about 30 percent of the time". During a visit in early January 2008 to El Paso, Carney said that he saw an incident where two illegal immigrants crossed {{in front of a}} project camera. Carney said that a technician tried to electronically reposition <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> to track them, but the picture was out of focus, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moved</b> too slowly, and the illegal immigrants got away.|$|R
500|$|The picture's {{significance}} {{has been}} the subject of broad speculation. Washington Post reviewer Desson Howe said that despite its emotional impact, the final scene [...] "feels more like a punchline for punchline's sake, a trumped-up coda". In her book-length analysis of the Coen brothers' films, Rowell suggests that Barton's fixation on the picture is ironic, considering its low culture status and his own pretensions toward high culture (speeches to the contrary notwithstanding). She further notes that the camera focuses on Barton himself as much as the picture while he gazes at it. At one point, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> past Barton to fill the frame with the woman on the beach. This tension between objective and subjective points of view appears again at the end of the film, when Barton finds himself– [...] in a sense– [...] inside the picture.|$|E
500|$|Barton Fink uses several stylistic {{conventions}} {{to accentuate}} the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> downward. This motion is repeated {{many times in the}} film, especially pursuant to Barton's claim that his job is to [...] "plumb the depths" [...] while writing. His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe (which he has presumably been polishing) suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements– [...] combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence– [...] create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that [...] "the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling".|$|E
500|$|The Rules of the Game {{is known}} for its early and {{elaborate}} use of deep focus cinematography. Renoir said he and his cinematographer Jean Bachelet [...] "ordered some special lenses, very fast lenses, but ones that still gave us considerable depth, so that we could keep our backgrounds in focus almost all the time." [...] This depth of field in his shots allowed Renoir to shoot in large rooms and long corridors in the chateau sequences, and characters were able to move freely between the background and the foreground. Approximately half of the shots in the film have camera movements. In many shots <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moves,</b> stops in place, changes direction and circles around the subjects. Film critic David Thomson said [...] "one has the impression of a camera that is always moving to cover as much as possible. One does not notice cuts, one delights in a continuity which is often on the verge of chaos and finally leads to tragedy in the intrusion of subplot into plot, of the theatrical into the real and of disaster into balances." ...|$|E
40|$|Multiview {{geometry}} is {{the study}} of two-dimensional images of three-dimensional scenes, a foundational subject in computer vision.

500|$|The {{video is}} set in a forest; Jackson, in scruffy clothes, sings [...] "Childhood" [...] while sitting on a tree stump. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> up the trees into the night sky and flying {{airships}} travel overhead. On board the ships, children are seen playing a variety of games as they travel further away from Jackson, towards the moon. Other children appear in the forest undergrowth before floating up towards the airships, but Jackson remains seated on the tree stump. Although the concept of the video had little in common with the corresponding film, Free Willy 2, two of its actors-Jason James Richter and Francis Capra-appear in the video. Richter appears halfway through, leading the armada of airships. Capra appears {{near the end of the}} video alongside Jackson as he watches the airships above. Richter looks down and sees him and extends his arm to bring him up to the airship as Capra floats upward toward it. Erika Christensen and Jena Malone also appeared in the video playing baseball. The video for [...] "Childhood" [...] is 4:27 minutes long. In the publication, Doug Pratt's DVD: Movies, Television, Music, Art, Adult, and More!, Pratt describes the video as [...] "outstanding, a Chris Van Allsburg-style vision of children in flying airships, crusading through a forest at night".|$|E
500|$|A Sean Hillen-directed {{music video}} was {{included}} on the DVD version of Rings Around the World released July 2001. The video starts with a static shot of the 1994 collage The Great Pyramids of Carlingford Lough, Irelantis by Hillen, which shows {{a man in a}} red jumper sat in a wooded area overlooking a river and three pyramids (this image was used for the front cover of all three formats of the single). <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> up to reveal a rotating globe in a stary sky. As [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] begins to play, the text [...] "In the beginning... No! Long before that..." [...] scrolls slowly {{from the bottom of the}} screen upwards. The song's lyrics are displayed in the same manner throughout the remainder of the video as several objects circle the globe including a flying saucer, metal cube and fireworks. Occasionally the camera switches to a close up view of the globe showing models of huge missile firing electricity pylons. As the song comes to an end the text [...] "Every building has been built" [...] appears in the middle of the screen and the camera pans down to show a black-and-white version of the Hillen collage used in the opening shot.|$|E
500|$|A promotional {{music video}} was {{produced}} {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Fire in My Heart" [...] as a single. The video was directed by Jake & Jim, who also directed the video for the group's subsequent single [...] "Do or Die", and shows the Super Furry Animals waiting to leave Mars having played a concert on the planet. The video begins with Gruff Rhys standing alone on the Martian soil, singing along to the song. A silver, computer generated, spaceship is seen landing behind Rhys. Around one minute into the track the camera pans back to reveal {{the rest of the}} Super Furry Animals sitting down to the left of Rhys. Guitarist Huw Bunford is sat on the floor playing an acoustic guitar {{while the rest of the}} group are sat on three metal seats which are connected together. Two aliens are seen walking from the spacecraft towards the band while drummer Dafydd Ieuan pours some of the Martian sand through his hands. When the aliens arrive, one of them, with a bald head, sunglasses and pointy ears, places his left hand on Rhys's right shoulder. Rhys turns around and looks at the other alien who has one eye in the centre of a large round face and is wearing a blue hoodie. The alien smiles at Rhys who then turns around and looks up to see the Earth in the sky above. Ieuan and keyboardist Cian Ciaran are also shown looking at the Earth before <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> behind them to reveal hundreds of aliens stood in front of several minaret-like towers, waving at the group. The band are shown picking up a suitcase and guitar before walking towards the spaceship as the song finishes. The aliens were designed by regular Super Furry Animals collaborator Pete Fowler, who acted as [...] "creative advisor" [...] for the video. According to Rhys the aliens were animated by the same special effects team that worked on [...] Rhys has stated that he considers his performance in the video to be [...] "wooden" [...] as he was forced to take painkillers during the shoot due to a [...] "stiff neck".|$|E
