5|$|On May 2, 1683, the Captain of the frigate HMS Falcon was sailing from England to the West Indies and beckoned {{the other}} {{officers}} {{to be present}} as he broke open his secret instructions. He learned that his mission was {{to aid in the}} hunt for a large treasure near Hispaniola. A sloop in convoy, HMS Bonetta (sometimes Bonito), was designated <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>most</b> of the searching, but the Falcon would act as aid and protection. These instructions were from Sir John Narborough, a rear admiral and commissioner of the Royal Navy, who also had the ear of King Charles II.|$|E
5|$|Hammond's {{performances}} {{earned him}} selection for the M.C.C. winter {{tour of the}} West Indies in the 1925–26 season. At that time, such tours were popular with amateur cricketers, who were often chosen for social rather than cricketing reasons. The touring party contained only eight professionals, who were expected <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>most</b> of the bowling and provide the cricketing quality. The West Indies team did not have Test status, so no official internationals were scheduled, {{but a series of}} representative matches against a West Indian team were played. Rain disrupted much of the cricket, but Hammond enjoyed the experience. In first-class matches, he scored 732 runs at an average of 48.80, with two hundreds and two fifties, and took 20 wickets at an average of 28.65. He scored 238 not out in the first representative game against a West Indies side. Following the tour, he won praise from Warner and the captain of the M.C.C. team, Freddie Calthorpe, and was believed to be close to the full England side.|$|E
5|$|In September 1979, Khalqist President Nur Muhammad Taraki {{was assassinated}} in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member Hafizullah Amin, who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979. A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's Babrak Karmal but {{inclusive}} of both factions, filled the vacuum. Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government did not expect <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>most</b> of the fighting in Afghanistan. As a result, however, the Soviets were now directly involved in {{what had been a}} domestic war in Afghanistan.|$|E

By the early 1990s, Le Château had 160 stores and had switched <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>most</b> of its design and manufacturing itself.

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 13 May, the 10th Panzer Division slipped into {{position}} upstream to the north-east of Sedan, ready to strike at its designated crossing point near the town of Wadelincourt. Downstream, the 2nd Panzer Division moved into position to cross at Donchery. The 1st Panzer Division prepared to strike at the Gaulier bridgehead, in the centre of Sedan's tactical front. It was on the northern bend of the Sedan Meuse loop that the Luftwaffe was to make its maximum effort, between Gaulier and Wadelincourt. To supplement his air support, Guderian stripped most of his Panzer Divisions of their artillery, which he then positioned directly opposite Gaulier. However, the artillery regiments lacked ammunition. Sustained and damaging bombardment through shelling was impossible. The Luftwaffe was going to have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>most</b> of the work. Guderian reported that his Corps had only 141 artillery pieces against the French 174. To the north and south of Sedan, the French X Corps and French XXXXI Corps (at the artillery fortress at Charleville-Mézières) could also add their artillery and shell Guderian's Panzer units as they crossed the bridgeheads. The slow advance of artillery units to the front added to the German numerical inferiority, which was now 1:3 against. Only in the afternoon did the German artillery make an appearance, but with little effect. The 2nd Panzer Division was forced to attack without artillery support. For these reasons, Guderian had decided the outcome depended on the quality of air support, acting as flying artillery.|$|E
5|$|Seoul unit {{director}} Dan Glass and Jim Mitchell {{were the}} visual effects supervisors {{of the first}} season. The season had a total VFX shot count of about 1200. An in-house VFX team was established in Chicago which completed over 700 shots. The major external VFX vendors were Locktix VFX (160-180 shots), Technicolor VFX (over 100 shots) and Encore VFX. Additional work was done by Studio 8 FX, Trace VFX and Almost Gold. Because of the series' tight budget and timeline the production made the decision <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>most</b> of the effects in-camera and only enhance them digitally where appropriate. In fact for {{a great number of}} shots which involved the sensates communicating and visiting each other telepathically the cast were simply moving {{in and out of the}} frame in timely fashion requiring no additional work. According to Glass, most of the VFX work that was done is invisible in the final show and consisted mostly of split-screens, crew and rig removal, weather augmentation and screen inserts. Executive producer Grant Hill commented he would be impressed if one would be able to recognize as many as 150 of the 1200 VFX shots, because most of them consisted of small things used to help the narrative, and they do not call attention to themselves. Of the more visible work done, Glass provided the examples of age manipulation of actors, dramatic enhancement of the weather in the car scenes in Iceland, a few greenscreens, and computer generated blades, blood and wounds.|$|E

25|$|The {{material}} {{used for}} the rod itself changed from the heavy woods native to England, to lighter and more elastic varieties imported from abroad, especially from South America and the West Indies. Bamboo rods became the generally favoured option from the mid 19th century, and several strips of the material were cut from the cane, milled into shape, and then glued together to form light, strong, hexagonal rods with a solid core that were superior to anything that preceded them. George Cotton and his predecessors fished their flies with long rods, and light lines allowing the wind <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>most</b> {{of the work of}} getting the fly to the fish.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, cone {{cells are}} less {{sensitive}} to the overall intensity of light, but come in three varieties that are sensitive to different frequency-ranges and thus {{are used in the}} perception of colour and photopic vision. Cone cells are highly concentrated in the fovea and have a high visual acuity meaning that they are better at spatial resolution than rod cells. Since cone cells are not as sensitive to dim light as rod cells, most night vision is limited to rod cells. Likewise, since cone cells are in the fovea, central vision (including the vision needed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>most</b> reading, fine detail work such as sewing, or careful examination of objects) is done by cone cells.|$|E
25|$|The Second Siege of Zaragoza {{began on}} 19 December 1808 and ended 20 February 1809 {{when the city}} surrendered. This time the French {{employed}} both Mortier's V Corps and Moncey's III Corps. As in the first siege, fighting was extremely bitter and costly for both sides. French losses are estimated at 10,000 killed, wounded and died of disease. Spanish losses were appalling, with 18,000 killed or dead from disease and 12,000 captured. Another 34,000 civilians perished, mostly from typhus and the city was in ruins. Though the soldiers of Moncey's corps were already suffering from illness {{at the start of}} the siege, they were called upon <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>most</b> of the fighting. The III Corps approached the city on the south side of the Ebro River with the divisions of Grandjean, Antoine Morlot and Louis François Félix Musnier. At the end of December Moncey was replaced by Jean-Andoche Junot.|$|E
25|$|Elliott's {{performances}} {{during the}} domestic season earned her a recall {{to the national}} team for the 2010 Rose Bowl series, and she played {{in each of the}} five ODIs during the Australian leg of the competition, and was used almost entirely as a specialist batsman at No. 4, as fellow spin bowling all-rounders Lisa Sthalekar and Shelley Nitschke, ranked in the top five in the world, were used <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>most</b> of the slow bowling. Elliott started poorly with single-digit scores in the first two matches at the Adelaide Oval, which Australia won. In the third match of the series at the Junction Oval, she scored 62 of Australia's 7/238, hitting five boundaries in a 101-ball innings. She then took 2/14 as Australia won by 102 runs and took an unassailable 3–0 lead. She did not take another wicket in the series and her only other double-digit score was a 25 from 52 balls in the final match. Elliott ended with 96 runs at 24.00 with a strike rate of 57.14, and two wickets at 10.50 at an economy rate of 2.33 as Australia whitewashed their visitors.|$|E
