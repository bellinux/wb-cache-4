40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{evidence}} that patients with schizophrenia benefit from standard cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) only if active techniques are used ('full therapy'). By contrast, attending sessions but not proceeding beyond engagement and assessment strategies ('partial therapy'), or simply not attending sessions ('no therapy'), is not associated with better outcomes. The factors leading to full therapy are unknown. We hypothesized that patients' initial ideas {{about the nature and}} extent of <b>their</b> <b>problems</b> would predict use of CBT. A match between patients' views of <b>their</b> <b>problems</b> and the principles underlying treatment would lead to better outcomes. METHOD: Ninety-two patients with a recent relapse of psychosis completed the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ) before receiving CBT. We examined whether their illness perceptions predicted the take-up of therapy. RESULTS: Patients who did not attend sessions believed <b>their</b> <b>problems</b> would not last as long as those who attended them. Those who attended sessions but did not proceed to full therapy had a lower sense of control over <b>their</b> <b>problems</b> and a more biological view of their causes. Patients who took up full therapy were more likely to attribute the cause of <b>their</b> <b>problems</b> to <b>their</b> personality and state of mind. The take-up of therapy was predicted neither by levels of psychiatric symptoms nor by insight. CONCLUSIONS: People with psychosis who have psychologically orientated views of <b>their</b> <b>problems,</b> including the potential to gain control over them, may be more likely to engage fully and do well with standard CBT for psychosis, irrespective of the severity of <b>their</b> <b>problems...</b>|$|R

They were to execute any man who presumptuously disregarded the priest or the judge, so that all the people would hear, be afraid, and not act presumptuously again.

25|$|The 1979 season {{would prove}} to be a big {{turnaround}} in Astros history. During the offseason, the Astros made an effort to fix some of <b>their</b> <b>problem</b> areas. They traded Floyd Bannister to Seattle for shortstop Craig Reynolds and acquired catcher Alan Ashby from Toronto for pitcher Mark Lemongello. Reynolds and Ashby were both solid in their positions and gave Houston some much needed consistency. The season started with a boost from pitcher Ken Forsch, who threw a no-hitter the Braves the second game of the season. In May 1979, New Jersey shipping tycoon Dr. John McMullen had agreed to buy the Astros. Now with an investor in charge, the Astros {{would be more likely to}} compete in the free agent market.|$|E

25|$|Many {{people with}} {{neurologic}} disorders exhibit uncontrollable episodes of laughing, crying, or both {{that are either}} exaggerated or contradictory to {{the context in which}} they occur. Where patients have significant cognitive deficits (e.g., Alzheimer's) it can be unclear whether it is true PBA as opposed to a grosser form of emotional dysregulation, but patients with intact cognition often report the symptom as disturbing. Patients report that their episodes are at best only partially amenable to voluntary control, and unless they experience a severe change of mental status, they often have insight into <b>their</b> <b>problem</b> and judge their emotional display as inappropriate and out of character. The clinical effect of PBA can be severe, with unremitting and persistent symptoms that can be disabling to patients, and may significantly affect quality of life for caregivers.|$|E
25|$|Chase {{reports from}} orbit that an Ashiyyur warship is inbound at high speed. Then another appears, slowing to make orbit around Sim's world of exile. Alex warns Chase {{to abandon their}} rented ship for the Corsarius; she does so just before the first Ashiyyur warship destroys their rented ship. Alex joins her and learns that the Armstrong drive on the Corsarius won’t be fully charged for about a day. <b>Their</b> <b>problem</b> is to stay alive until the Armstrong drive is ready. They borrow a classic {{maneuver}} from one of Sim’s battles and leave orbit at high speed headed directly toward the incoming Ashiyyur warship, which cannot slow its speed quickly enough to meet them. It uses lasers to disable Corsarius magnetic drives; Chase realizes too late that she has forgotten to raise the ship’s shields. The Ashiyyur warship reverses its trajectory and reaches them about ten hours before they can jump. It demands their surrender. Through a strategem, Alex and Chase are able to fire Corsarius’ major weapons at it, damaging it badly and forcing it to flee. Ten hours later, the interstellar drive activates. It is not an Armstrong drive but something else, product of Rashim Machesney’s genius. In an eye blink, Corsarius is in orbit around Rimway, and safe.|$|E
25|$|The second series {{begins with}} the newlyweds {{arriving}} from a honeymoon in Greece. The in-laws meet again at the Shipman's house in Essex, where Nessa has some shocking revelations– especially for Smithy, who learns that she is pregnant with his baby, and although he makes it clear he thoroughly dislikes the woman, he is generally civil and supportive towards her about their child. Meanwhile, Gavin and Stacey, living at Pam and Mick's house, run into trouble when Stacey struggles {{to find a job}} and becomes home-sick for Barry and her family. The couple try to overcome <b>their</b> <b>problem</b> by looking for an apartment or house in Essex, but Stacey is still dissatisfied and is considering moving back to South Wales to be with her family. In the final episode of the series, Stacey takes off her wedding ring, much to the upset of Gavin, but this is interrupted by the news of Nessa unexpectedly going into labour a month early. Pam, Mick and Stacey hurry across to Wales, whilst Gavin rushes to find Smithy with Smithy's sister, Rudi (Sheridan Smith), eventually finding him in the pub watching football. They arrive to find that Nessa has given birth to a boy, Neil. Gavin and Stacey decide to put their differences aside and are together once again.|$|E

On-screen, neither family approved of Scott and Charlene's plan to move in together, but when Scott learned his father was only 18 when he got married, Scott found the solution to <b>their</b> <b>problem</b> and asked Charlene to marry him.

[...] Once the new bears finally realise <b>their</b> <b>problem,</b> they try to fix it with more wishes, but to no availCare-a-lot becomes a blank white space (wishing {{that all of this}} was gone), the bears begin to glow in color (wishing for everything to be back how it was, but with more color), Grumpy Bear turns black and white (wishing for less color), and Messy Bear turns into Messy Cub (wishing for everything to be like it used to be). [...] When they try to wish Twinkers back to Wish Bear, the star ultimately loses his power from exhaustion (because they had been pushing him much too hard). [...] Wish Bear uses Grumpy Bear's rocket to bring him to the Big Wish, a grandmother star, in the sky. Big Wish restores his power, but not before Wish Bear assures her that she has learned her lesson, which is wishing is fun, but it is far more important to work hard to achieve your dreams.|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to solve <b>their</b> <b>problem</b> in finding a {{reliable}} opening partnership in the series, England promoted Verity to open the batting in the fourth Test. After Australia were bowled out for 288, Verity and Barnett put on 53runs together, England's best opening partnership of the series. Wisden praised Verity's defence but {{said he had not}} solved the problem of finding a partner for Barnett. England scored 330 but Australia's second innings of 433 left England needing 392. Barnett and Verity began with a stand of 45, but England lost by 148 runs. In two innings, Verity scored 19 and 17, but was wicketless in the match. Having levelled the series, Australia won the final match by a large margin to take the series 3–2. Verity took just one wicket in the match. In the series, he took 10wickets at an average of 45.50; in all first-class matches in Australia, he captured 28wickets at 30.75 and secured 10wickets at 18.20 in two matches in New Zealand {{at the end of the}} tour.
