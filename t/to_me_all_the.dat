2500|$|Of {{being in}} a band with his younger brother Jonny Greenwood, Colin said: [...] "Beyond the normal brotherly thing, I respect {{him as a person}} and a musician."

60|$|Ray smiled, {{but he did}} {{not speak}} another word <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> breakfast-time. Once I made a remark to him, and his reply was curt, almost rude. I left the room a few minutes afterwards, and came face to face in the hall with Lady Angela.|$|E
