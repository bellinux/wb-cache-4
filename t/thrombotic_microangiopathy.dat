25|$|Upshaw–Schulman {{syndrome}} (USS) is the recessively inherited form of {{thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura}} (TTP), a {{rare and}} complex blood coagulation disease. USS {{is caused by the}} absence of the ADAMTS13 protease resulting in the persistence of ultra large von Willebrand factor multimers (ULVWF), causing episodes of acute <b>thrombotic</b> <b>microangiopathy</b> with disseminated multiple small vessel obstructions. These obstructions deprive downstream tissues from blood and oxygen, which can result in tissue damage and death. The presentation of an acute USS episode is variable but usually associated with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) with schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear, fever and signs of ischemic organ damage in the brain, kidney and heart.|$|E
25|$|HUS {{was first}} {{defined as a}} {{syndrome}} in 1955. The more common form of the disease, Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli HUS (STEC-HUS), is triggered by the infectious agent E. coli O157:H7, and several other non-O157:H7 E. coli serotypes. Certain Shiga toxin-secreting strains of Shigella dysenteriae can also cause HUS. Approximately 5% of cases are classified as pneumococcal HUS, which results from infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae, the agent that causes traditional lobar pneumonia. There is also a rare, chronic, and severe form known as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), which is caused by genetic defects resulting in chronic, uncontrolled complement activation. Both STEC-HUS and aHUS cause endothelial damage, leukocyte activation, platelet activation, and widespread inflammation and multiple thromboses in the small blood vessels, a condition known as systemic <b>thrombotic</b> <b>microangiopathy</b> (TMA), which leads to thrombotic events as well as organ damage/failure and death.|$|E
25|$|Patients with HUS {{commonly}} {{exhibit the}} {{signs and symptoms of}} <b>thrombotic</b> <b>microangiopathy</b> (TMA), which can include abdominal pain, low platelet count, elevated lactate dehydrogenase LDH, a chemical released from damaged cells, and which is therefore a marker of cellular damage) decreased haptoglobin (indicative of the breakdown of red blood cells) anemia (low red blood cell count)/schistocytes (damaged red blood cells), elevated creatinine (a protein waste product generated by muscle metabolism and eliminated renally, proteinuria (indicative of kidney injury), confusion, fatigue, edema (swelling), nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. Additionally, patients with aHUS typically present with an abrupt onset of systemic signs and symptoms such as acute kidney failure, hypertension (high blood pressure), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, lung complications, pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), liver necrosis (death of liver cells or tissue), encephalopathy (brain dysfunction), seizure, and coma. Failure of neurologic, cardiac, renal, and gastrointestinal (GI) organs, as well as death, can occur unpredictably at any time, either very quickly or following prolonged symptomatic or asymptomatic disease progression.|$|E

25|$|Atypical {{hemolytic}} uremic syndrome (aHUS) is {{an extremely}} rare, life-threatening, progressive disease that frequently has a genetic component. In most cases it is caused by chronic, uncontrolled activation of the complement system, {{a branch of the}} body’s immune system that destroys and removes foreign particles. The disease affects both children and adults and is characterized by systemic <b>thrombotic</b> <b>microangiopathy</b> (TMA), the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can lead to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, and death. The complement system activation may be due to mutations in the complement regulatory proteins (factor H, factor I, or membrane cofactor protein), or is occasionally due to acquired neutralizing autoantibody inhibitors of these complement system components, for example anti–factor H antibodies. Despite the use of supportive care, historically an estimated 33–40% of patients died or developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with the first clinical bout of aHUS. Including subsequent relapses, a total of approximately two-thirds (65%) of patients died, required dialysis, or had permanent renal damage within the first year after diagnosis despite plasma exchange or plasma infusion (PE/PI).|$|E

30|$|Introduction: <b>Thrombotic</b> <b>microangiopathies</b> (TMAs) are severe {{diseases}} {{which often}} require admission in an {{intensive care unit}} (ICU). Prompt initiation of targeted therapies is required for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), but no specific therapy is consensual for Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS). Thus, rapid differentiation of STEC-HUS is mandatory to tailor the initial treatment. Furthermore, apart from large outbreaks, characteristic features of this syndrome in adults have not been described.|$|R

50|$|Nephropathy can be {{associated}} with some therapies used to treat cancer. The most common form of kidney disease in cancer patients is Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) which can usually be due to volume depletion from vomiting and diarrhea that occur following chemotherapy or occasionally due to kidney toxicities of chemotherapeutic agents. Kidney failure from break down of cancer cells, usually after chemotherapy, is unique to onconephrology. Several chemotherapeutic agents, for example Cisplatin, are associated with acute and chronic kidney injuries. Newer agents such as anti Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (anti VEGF) are also associated with similar injuries, as well as proteinuria, hypertension and <b>thrombotic</b> <b>microangiopathy.</b>|$|E
