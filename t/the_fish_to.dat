5|$|In 2014, Indonesia {{has brought}} in a fishing and export ban as it has {{realized}} that manta ray tourism is more economically beneficial than allowing <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>to</b> be killed. A dead manta is worth $40 to $500 while manta ray tourism can bring in $1 million during {{the life of a}} single manta ray. Indonesia has 5.8 million square kilometers (2.2 million square miles) of ocean and this is now the world's largest sanctuary for manta rays.|$|E
5|$|The black dragonfish (also {{called the}} {{northern}} stoplight loosejaw) Malacosteus niger {{is believed to}} be one of the only fish to produce a red glow. Its eyes, however, are insensitive to this wavelength; it has an additional retinal pigment which fluoresces blue-green when illuminated. This alerts <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>to</b> the presence of its prey. The additional pigment is thought to be assimilated from chlorophyll derivatives found in the copepods which form part of its diet.|$|E
5|$|While most marine {{bioluminescence}} {{is green}} to blue, some deep sea barbeled dragonfishes in the genera Aristostomias, Pachystomias and Malacosteus emit a red glow. This adaptation allows <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>to</b> see red-pigmented prey, which are normally {{invisible in the}} deep ocean environment where red light has been filtered out by the water column.|$|E

5|$|Bart and Lisa {{go fishing}} {{downstream}} of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and Springfield Shopper reporter Dave Shutton pulls {{up just as}} Bart catches a three-eyed fish, much to both the kids' and Shutton's surprise. The fish, nicknamed Blinky by the media, makes headlines around the state, and incumbent governor Mary Bailey calls in a government inspection team to investigate nuclear waste coming from the plant that could have caused <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>to</b> mutate. After the inspection, the plant's owner, Mr. Burns, is presented {{with a list of}} 342 violations, which would cost $56 million to rectify. Distraught, Mr. Burns talks to plant employee Homer, who half-heartedly suggests Mr. Burns run for governor against Bailey so that he could change the standards and prevent the plant from being shut down. Mr. Burns instantly pounces on the idea.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic {{species are}} mostly {{external}} parasites of fish or crustaceans and feed on blood. The larvae of the Gnathiidae family and adult cymothoidids have {{piercing and sucking}} mouthparts and clawed limbs adapted for clinging onto their hosts. In general, isopod parasites have diverse lifestyles and include Cancricepon elegans, found in the gill chambers of crabs; Athelges tenuicaudis, attached to the abdomen of hermit crabs; Crinoniscus equitans living inside the barnacle Balanus perforatus; cyproniscids, living inside ostracods and free-living isopods; bopyrids, living in the gill chambers or on the carapace of shrimps and crabs and causing a characteristic bulge which is even recognisable in some fossil crustaceans; and entoniscidae living inside some species of crab and shrimp. Cymothoa exigua is a parasite of the spotted rose snapper Lutjanus guttatus in the Gulf of California; it causes the tongue of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>to</b> atrophy and takes its place in what {{is believed to be}} the first instance discovered of a parasite functionally replacing a host structure in animals.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 20thcentury, when Swan Falls Dam was {{constructed}} {{on the middle}} Snake River upstream of Hells Canyon, the fifteen dams and reservoirs on the river have posed an increasing problem for migrating salmon. Agricultural lands and their resulting runoff have also {{had a significant impact}} on the success rate of migrating fish. Salmon can travel up the Snake River as far as Hells Canyon Dam, using the fish passage facilities of the four lower Snake River dams, leaving the Clearwater, Grande Ronde and Salmon river to sustain spawning salmon. Rising in several forks in the Clearwater Mountains of central Idaho, the Clearwater and Salmon River watersheds are nearly undeveloped with the enormous exception of Dworshak Dam on the North Fork Clearwater River. The watershed of the Grande Ronde in northeastern Oregon is also largely undeveloped. The four reservoirs formed by the lower Snake River dams—Lake Sacagawea, Lake Herbert G. West, Lake Bryan, and Lower Granite Lake—have also formed problems, as the downstream current in the pools is often not enough for <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>to</b> sense, confusing their migration routes.|$|E

25|$|Corydoras panda inhabits clear river {{waters that}} are {{relatively}} fast-flowing, well-oxygenated, and flowing over substrates that may comprise soft sand or fine gravel. These rivers are usually well vegetated with assorted species of aquatic plants. The {{proximity of the}} home rivers of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>to</b> the Andes mountain range, and the replenishment of those rivers with meltwaters from Andean snows at higher altitudes, has led <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>to</b> be adaptable to cooler temperatures than the norm for 'tropical' fishes—the temperature range of the fish is 16°C to 28°C, though the fish exhibits a marked preference for the cooler regions of this temperature spectrum, particularly in captivity. Indeed, the fish can, for limited periods, survive temperatures as low as 12°C, though captive rearing at such low temperatures is ill-advised. The native waters of Corydoras panda are consequently mineral-deficient, with a neutral to slightly acid pH, and replication of such conditions in captivity are recommended for successful maintenance.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{theories}} {{about how this}} happens. One theory {{is that there are}} geomagnetic and chemical cues which the salmon use to guide them back to their birthplace. The fish may be sensitive to the Earth's magnetic field, which could allow <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>to</b> orient itself in the ocean, so it can navigate back to the estuary of its natal stream.|$|E

The huge range of fly patterns documented today for all sorts of target species—trout, salmon, bass and panfish, pike, saltwater, tropical exotics, etc.—are not easily categorized as merely imitative, attractors, searching or impressionistic.|$|E
25|$|Cyprinids are stomachless {{fish with}} toothless jaws. Even so, food can be {{effectively}} chewed by the gill rakers of the specialized last gill bow. These pharyngeal teeth allow <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>to</b> make chewing motions against a chewing plate formed by a bony {{process of the}} skull. The pharyngeal teeth are unique to each species and are used by scientists to identify species. Strong pharyngeal teeth allow fish such as the common carp and ide to eat hard baits such as snails and bivalves.|$|E

50|$|Having {{overcome}} {{the challenge of}} persuading <b>the</b> <b>fishes</b> <b>to</b> spawn, <b>the</b> aquarist soon discovers that the rummy-nose tetra presents another hurdle to successful captive reproduction—the fry are among the slowest growing of all characins, and indeed among the slowest-growing of all popular aquarium fishes. Infusoria and other similar foods are required for the fry {{for a minimum of}} three weeks, and it is not unknown for <b>the</b> <b>fishes</b> <b>to</b> take as long as twelve weeks to migrate to larger foods, growth rates being particularly sensitive to temperature. Success at raising fry to a size where they are capable of taking larger food morsels is {{much more likely to be}} achieved if the fry are kept at temperatures above 30 °C for the first 3 months of life: even then, attrition rates due to the appearance of diseases among <b>the</b> <b>fishes</b> (most frequently bacterial infections) can be severe.|$|R

25|$|The eye {{is covered}} by a {{moderately}} well-developed adipose eyelid, and the posterior extremity of the jaw is vertically under or just past the posterior margin of the pupil. The eye of the giant trevally has a horizontal streak in which ganglion and photoreceptor cell densities are markedly greater {{than the rest of}} the eye. This is believed to allow <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>to</b> gain a panoramic view of its surroundings, removing the need to constantly move the eye, which in turn will allow easier of detection of prey or predators in that field of view.|$|E
25|$|Releasing wild trout helps {{preserve}} {{the quality of}} a fishery. Trout are more delicate than most fish and require careful handling. When a trout has been caught but the hook is still embedded, wet your hands before handling the fish. Dry hands stick to the adhesive slime coating the fish and can pull off its scales. It is preferred for <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>to</b> remain in the water when removing the hook, but holding the trout out of the water will not be lethal, provided the hook is removed quickly and the trout is returned immediately.|$|E
25|$|Sampling schemes may {{be without}} {{replacement}} ('WOR'—no element can be selected {{more than once}} in the same sample) or with replacement ('WR'—an element may appear multiple times in the one sample). For example, if we catch fish, measure them, and immediately return them to the water before continuing with the sample, this is a WR design, because we might end up catching and measuring the same fish more than once. However, if we do not return <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>to</b> the water (e.g., if we eat the fish), this becomes a WOR design.|$|E
