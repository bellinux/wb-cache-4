5|$|The {{decision}} {{may have}} important implications for other disputes relating to the extent of executive power and the unitary executive theory.

5|$|Another {{meeting on}} the issue was called on 6 December 1966, {{attended}} by Johnson, McNamara, the deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance, Walt Rostow of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Agency</b> (NSA) and the Joint Chiefs. Rostow took {{the side of the}} JCS and it appeared that development would start. However, McNamara once again outlined the problems and stated that the simplest way to close the ABM gap was to simply build more ICBMs, rendering the Soviet system impotent and a great waste of money. He then proposed that the money sidelined by Congress for deployment be used for initial deployment studies while the US attempted to negotiate an arms limitation treaty. Johnson agreed with this compromise, and ordered Secretary of State Dean Rusk to open negotiations with the Soviets.|$|E

5|$|During the Bahraini {{uprising}} of 2011, the Khawalid brothers {{objected to}} {{compromise with the}} opposition and instead preferred crackdown. After a failed round of negotiations led by the CP, the Khawalid brothers led the crackdown, described as the widest in Bahrain's modern history. The Commander in Chief of the army, Khalifa bin Ahmed, was given wide authority with the announcement of martial law; he led a main crackdown operation, presided over military courts and made several interviews with regional and local media. Another Al Khawalid involved in the crackdown was the then-director of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Agency,</b> which {{was found to be}} responsible for arbitrary arrests and systematic torture. The crackdown empowered the Khawalid brothers faction further and marginalized the CP, who found himself and allies stripped from their powers.|$|E
5|$|Yusuf {{has built}} a largely subservient and loyal {{apparatus}} by putting his fellow Majerteen clansmen in strategic positions. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Agency</b> (NSA) under General Mohamed Warsame (“Darwish”) and the so-called “Majerteen militia” units in the TFG army operate in parallel and often above other security agencies. Their exact number is hard to ascertain, but estimates suggest about 2,000. They are well catered for, well armed and often carry out counter-insurgency operations {{with little or no}} coordination with other security agencies. In the short term, this strategy may appear effective for the president, who can unilaterally employ the force essentially as he pleases. However, it undermines morale in the security services and is a cause of their high desertion rates.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{personal}} expertise on foreign matters, Truman listened closely to his top advisors, especially George Marshall and Dean Acheson. He won bipartisan support for both the Truman Doctrine, which formalized a policy of Soviet containment, and the Marshall Plan, which aimed to help rebuild postwar Europe. To get Congress to spend the vast sums necessary to restart the moribund European economy, Truman used an ideological argument, arguing that Communism flourishes in economically deprived areas. As part of the U.S. Cold War strategy, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 and reorganized military forces by merging the Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (later the Department of Defense) and creating the U.S. Air Force. The act also created the CIA and the National Security Council. In 1952, Truman secretly consolidated and empowered the cryptologic elements of the United States by creating <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Agency</b> (NSA).|$|E

5|$|Continuing north, {{the parkway}} {{encounters}} MD32 (Savage Road) near Fort Meade. MD32 offers northbound travelers direct access into the fort and to <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Agency,</b> while the next interchange, another employee-only access road into Fort Meade, features only a southbound exit and northbound entrance. Fort Meade {{itself is a}} military installation opened in 1917 that trained 3.5 million troops during World War II and is still a major fort. To {{the west of the}} parkway off MD32 is the Savage Mill, which was an operating cotton mill from 1822 to 1947 and is currently an antique mall, and the Bollman Truss Railroad Bridge, an 1869 cast and wrought iron bridge along the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX's Capital Subdivision) line between Baltimore and Washington D.C. After this interchange, the road continues to a cloverleaf interchange with MD175 (Jessup Road), where NPS maintenance of the parkway comes to an end {{at the south end of}} the interchange.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security {{was created}} by the Homeland Security Act to {{coordinate}} domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The USA Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge, to monitor telephone communications, e-mail, and Internet use by terror suspects, and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. The FAA ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes, and assigned sky marshals to flights. Further, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for airport security. The law created the Transportation Security Administration to inspect passengers and luggage, causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy. After suspected abuses of the USA Patriot Act were brought to light in June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and the PRISM program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced the Patriot Act in 2001, said that <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Agency</b> overstepped its bounds.|$|E
5|$|SH151 {{begins at}} Loop1604, the outer loop around San Antonio, {{on the west}} side of San Antonio and from there follows a southeastern path through the western part of the city. The highway {{provides}} access to the SeaWorld San Antonio theme park as well as industry along its corridor to include Chase, Hyatt Hill Country Resort, World Savings, Philips semiconductor, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Agency</b> campus, QVC, American Funds, Maxim Integrated Products, and the Northwest Vista College, as well as the nearby Southwest Research Institute. Microsoft has also selected the corridor for a $550 million data center. The highway continues to the southeast to a junction with Interstate 410 (I-410), the inner loop around San Antonio. There is not a direct connect interchange at the junction of I-410. It is necessary to travel on both highways' frontage roads in order to change highways. The highway continues to the southeast through mainly undeveloped land until it merges with US90. According to the San Antonio Master Thoroughfare Plan, there are plans to extend SH 151 westward from Loop1604 to SH211. The plan also shows the construction of an interchange at Loop 1604.|$|E
