40|$|<b>The</b> {{threat of}} <b>nuclear</b> warfare {{is an ongoing}} global concern. The {{reduction}} of this threat is an international effort that is aided by numerous technologies aimed at the detection, localization, and characterization of special nuclear material (SNM). Radiation imaging systems have a distinct advantage over more traditional systems {{in that they are}} designed to provide localized information of the observed the radiation field. Accurate characterization of detected sources requires robust reconstruction algorithms with well characterized uncertainties that are capable of delivering consistently reliable information. This work presents a versatile detection system and powerful reconstruction algorithm that, when combined, are well-suited to meeting many present challenges in <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>nonproliferation</b> and <b>treaty</b> verification fields. The detection system, known as the Dual-Particle Imager (DPI), is a single device capable of performing both imaging and spectroscopy with photons and fast neutrons. The reconstruction algorithm leverages maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (MLEM) and a robust system matrix, simulated in MCNPX-PoliMi, to perform image reconstruction and simultaneously unfold localized energy spectra for each pixel in the image. The localized energy spectra make it possible to analyze multiple detected sources simultaneously and the spectrum unfolding capabilities significantly improve the information available for characterizing the sources. Combining this algorithm with the DPI allows for localized spectra to be computed for photons and neutrons, which is particularly useful for the localization and characterization of SNM. The capabilities of this algorithm have been demonstrated through series of experiments and a detailed analysis of the uncertainties associated with the reconstruction process has been performed. The algorithm was used to analyze two complex environments, measured by the DPI, that each contained an SNM sample in a field of multiple shielded and unshielded sources. An in-depth analysis of the localized photon and neutron spectra show that not only can all present radioactive materials be identified, but also that some determinations can be made regarding the presence and nature of shielding material. The presented results demonstrate the relevance of this work to <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>nonproliferation</b> and <b>treaty</b> verification field...|$|R

40|$|Since 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) {{has worked}} to ensure the safe and {{responsible}} promotion of <b>nuclear</b> technology throughout <b>the</b> world. The IAEA operates {{at the intersection of}} <b>the</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Nonproliferation</b> <b>Treaty’s</b> (NPT) fourth and third articles, which guarantee Parties to the Treaty the right to peaceful uses of nuclear technology, provided those activities are placed under safeguards verified by the IAEA. However, while the IAEA has enjoyed substantial success and prestige in the international community, there is a concern that its resources are being stretched to a point where it may no longer be possible to execute its multifaceted mission in its entirety. As noted by the Director General (DG) in 2008, demographics suggest that every aspect of the IAEA’s operations will be in higher demand due to increasing reliance on non-carbon-based energy and the concomitant nonproliferation, safety, and security risks that growth entails. In addition to these <b>nuclear</b> energy concerns, <b>the</b> demand for technical developmental assistance in the fields of food security, resource conservation, and human health is also predicted to increase {{as the rest of the}} world develops. Even with a 100 % value-for-money rating by the U. S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and being described as an “extraordinary bargain” by the United Nations Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, real budget growth at the Agency has been limited to zero-real growth for a better part of the last two decades. Although the 2012 regular budget (RB) received a small increase for most programs, the 2013 RB has been set at zero-real growth. As a result, the IAEA has had to defer infrastructure investments, which has hindered its ability to provide the public goods its Members seek, decreased global security and development opportunities, and functionally transformed the IAEA into a charity, dependent on extrabudgetary (EB) contributions to sustain its mission and capabilities. To resolve these resource constraints, we recommend the creation of an endowment, funded entirely through private contributions. Our initial estimates for the endowment are that a € 2 B principal. This level of capitalization could provide significant support to all aspects of the IAEA’s mission, including Capital Investment and Innovation; Technical Cooperation; as well as incentivizing the policy and technology entrepreneurship that will be necessary for the future health of the nonproliferation regime. Given this potential, our future efforts will focus on a more rigorous assessment of the financial requirements, while simultaneously creating the beginnings of a functional organization. These include: organizational structure, metrics for grant-making and performance evaluation, and outreach and fundraising strategies. At the end of this process, there should be sufficient information and engagement to begin to operationalize the endowment through external funding sources...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} international security institutions affect {{the behavior of}} states. These institutions seem to defy existing theory: punishment is difficult and information hard to come by, yet security institutions often boast near-universal membership and seem to enjoy high levels of compliance. I argue that these institutions can effectively constrain state behavior because states use the membership and compliance decisions of others as important clues about the efficacy of an institution and about states' underlying policy preferences. I test my hypotheses using data on states' pursuit {{of nuclear weapons and}} their membership in the various international agreements that make up <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>nonproliferation</b> regime. Chapter 1 summarizes my argument and the contribution of this work to the literature on international organizations and international security. Chapter 2 presents a new theory of compliance in which a state's decision to abide by an international commitment is driven by the track record of the institution [...] -the institution's recent history of compliance. Using data on nuclear weapons programs between 1968 and 2010, my analysis shows that members of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>nonproliferation</b> regime are more likely to pursue nuclear weapons when there have been a greater number of recent violations of the regime. In Chapter 3, I argue that deeper security institutions may actually attract more members, because states will only join institutions when they have some reassurance that other member states will comply. I find that states are more likely to join <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>nonproliferation</b> regime when various indicators [...] - verification, enforcement, and compliance [...] -indicate greater depth. Chapter 4 examines selective enforcement within international security institutions. I argue that enforcing states look to the policy preferences of violators when deciding whether to punish their transgressions. I use data on membership in the various agreements that make up <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>nonproliferation</b> regime to derive a new measure of state preferences over nonproliferation policy issues, and show that a state's pattern of treaty memberships within the regime significantly affects the likelihood that the international community will pursue costly enforcement measures if <b>the</b> state seeks <b>nuclear</b> weapon...|$|R
