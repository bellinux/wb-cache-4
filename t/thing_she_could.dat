500|$|Sagan {{incorporated}} Kip Thorne's {{study of}} wormhole space travel into the screenplay. The characterization of Dr. Ellie Arroway {{was inspired by}} Dr. Jill Tarter, head of Project Phoenix of the SETI Institute; Jodie Foster researched the lead role by meeting her. Tarter [...] served as a consultant on the story, realistically portraying struggling careers of women scientists from the 1950s to 1970s. The writers debated whether Arroway should have a baby at the film's end. Although Guber was impressed with Sagan and Druyan's treatment, he hired various screenwriters to rewrite the script. New characters were added, one of them [...] a Native American park ranger-turned-astronaut. Guber suggested that Arroway have an estranged teenage son, who he believed would add more depth to the storyline. [...] "Here was a woman consumed {{with the idea that}} there was something out there worth listening to," [...] Guber said, [...] "but the one <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never make contact with was her own child. To me, that's what the film had to be about." [...] Sagan and Druyan disagreed with Guber's idea and it was not incorporated into the storyline. In 1982, Guber took Contact to Warner Bros. Pictures and with the film's development stalled, Sagan started to turn his original idea into a novel, which was published by Simon and Schuster in September 1985. The film adaptation remained in development and Guber eventually vacated his position at Warner Bros. in 1989.|$|E
500|$|Cindy begins helping Darren plan {{his wedding}} to girlfriend Nancy. Waring felt Cindy's {{feelings}} had been [...] "reawakened" [...] through this storyline, adding {{that they never}} [...] "fully went away". Waring opined that Darren asking Cindy to help plan his wedding made her feel [...] "needed and wanted". Waring felt that Cindy does not plan to split Darren and Nancy up but that there is [...] "a little part of [...] that thinks, 'Surely he's going to choose me?" [...] Waring added that when Cindy is trying on wedding dresses for Nancy Cindy thinks [...] "that it should be her". Cindy attempts to kiss Darren which Waring said is [...] "the worst possible <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have done, because she thinks it means something but Darren thinks otherwise". Dawson said Darren is no longer interested in Cindy. Waring said Darren telling Cindy {{she will have to}} let him go leaves her [...] "devastated". Waring added that when Cindy realises how much Darren likes Nancy she says [...] "that if Nancy is who Darren wants, then she'll just have to accept it". Dawson felt that Darren's relationship with Cindy was [...] "just sex", adding that [...] "it was more of a raw attraction rather than something that would work well in the long-term". Dawson added that it was good to revisit the relationship as the pair have been through a lot together. He added that since his relationship with Cindy [...] "Darren has matured ... Their recent goodbye scene was a great one to bring a bit of closure to what they had".|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 1 {{records that}} one day Freyja passed by an open stone where dwarfs lived. Four dwarfs were smithying a golden {{necklace}}, and it was nearly done. Looking at the necklace, the dwarfs thought Freyja to be most fair, and she the necklace. Freyja offered to buy the collar from them with silver and gold and other items of value. The dwarfs {{said that they had}} no lack of money, and that for the necklace the only <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> offer them would be a night with each of them. [...] "Whether she liked it better or worse", Freyja agreed to the conditions, and so spent a night with each of the four dwarfs. The conditions were fulfilled and the necklace was hers. Freyja went home to her bower as if nothing happened.|$|E

5000|$|Sarah is a {{novel by}} Laura Albert, written under the name JT LeRoy, a persona that she has {{described}} as an [...] "avatar," [...] asserting that it enabled her to write <b>things</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not have said as herself.|$|R
60|$|This, {{and the way}} {{she made}} his toast--very crisp--and aired his linen--very dry, were {{practically}} the only <b>things</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do for a man naturally inclined to independence, and accustomed from his manner of life to fend for himself.|$|R
2500|$|Yamin {{audition}}ed in Boston, Massachusetts, singing Leon Russell's [...] "A Song for You", but his audition was not aired (it {{was later}} aired on October 24, 2009, {{as part of}} the American Idol Rewind - season 5 show). He performed the song again in front of the judges during Hollywood rounds, as well as Rascal Flatts's [...] "Bless the Broken Road". During the group auditions, Yamin and his group performed [...] "It's In Her Kiss" [...] (aka [...] "The Shoop Shoop Song") from Betty Everett; Simon Cowell disliked the group performance, but Randy Jackson said Yamin was the best one in his group, and Paula Abdul said it was a good <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> look past two left feet, in a way of saying he did not dance well but he could definitely sing. He was sent through by the judges and made it through to the finals of the competition.|$|E
2500|$|Hooper called Wanrow at {{her home}} and {{told her about the}} altercation and her daughter's {{identification}} of the man who had raped her. [...] Wanrow had been home trying to contact someone to repair her car. [...] She pleaded with Hooper to bring all the children by taxi to her home where they would be safe. [...] Hooper said the police told her the worst <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do was to leave her home and instead asked Wanrow if she could borrow her gun for protection. [...] Concerned about her two children as well as Hooper and her three children, Wanrow took a taxi to Hooper's home. The landlord of the property informed the two mothers that Wesler had attempted to molest another young boy who had previously lived at the same residence, and that he had been committed to the Eastern State Hospital for the mentally ill. [...] Hooper and the landlord said the police suggested that they [...] "conk him over the head" [...] with a baseball bat should he try to return and another advised them to [...] "wait until he gets in the house".|$|E
6000|$|... "About {{the most}} ill-placed <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have said, Freddy," [...] replied Mrs. Langford, [...] "considering that I was always {{accused of having}} made the match." ...|$|E
60|$|Letty {{stood by}} the window as close as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to Teddy {{in a world that}} seemed wholly made up of {{unexpected}} <b>things.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not heed the others, it was only when Teddy spoke to the others, or when they spoke to Teddy, that they existed for her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear," [...] he said, and {{he could}} see by her {{whiteness}} how intensely her spirit pressed against the <b>things</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not say. He put his arms about her, he kissed her ear, and they sat for a time in silence.|$|R
60|$|The {{state of}} bliss, when Miss Inger was present, was supreme in the girl, but always eager, eager. As she went home, Ursula dreamed of the schoolmistress, made {{infinite}} dreams of <b>things</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> give her, {{of how she}} might make the elder woman adore her.|$|R
6000|$|... "She didn't want to {{send for}} help so long as she had any <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> sell," [...] said the little boy in a deprecating tone.|$|E
60|$|The maid from New Hampshire said no {{word for}} a very long time. Then she quoted poetry, which was perhaps the best <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have done.|$|E
60|$|Philip {{stared at}} her in surprise, for the one <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be counted upon to do with alacrity was to give advice. She went on quickly in a low voice, savage with fury.|$|E
60|$|The child's {{heart beat}} {{fast as she}} listened to these <b>things.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not understand, but she seemed to feel far-off things. It gave her a deep, joyous thrill, to know she hailed from far off, from Poland, and that dark-bearded {{impressive}} man. Strange, her antecedents were, and she felt fate {{on either side of her}} terrible.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{watch all}} you do, and learn; {{so that the}} next time Nancy goes off in a hurry, I can take her place, and not have to give the boys what they hate,--a picked-up dinner," [...] {{answered}} Edith, pleased with her part, yet a little mortified to find how few plain <b>things</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make well.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Kybird {{looked at}} her. It {{was on the}} tip of her tongue to call her a poll parrot. She was a free-spoken woman as a rule, and it was terrible to have to sit still and waste all the good <b>things</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have said to her in favour of unsatisfying pin-pricks. She sat smouldering.|$|R
6000|$|Deane nodded. It was, after all, {{perhaps the}} most {{sensible}} <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do to get clear away! [...] "Send me my tea at eight o'clock," [...] he ordered, [...] "and {{let me have a}} bath at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not think}} she would have gone to Aylmer Castle,--though I dare say it is the best <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do. She seemed to me to dislike the Aylmers,--that is, Lady Aylmer,--so much! But I suppose she is right?" ...|$|E
60|$|On {{came the}} steps, and open flew the door, {{more and more}} ready to sink into the earth looked Angela, and so {{interested}} grew nurse Pigott, that she actually poured some hot tea on to her dress, a <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never remember having done before.|$|E
60|$|The {{room was}} empty, {{all the men}} having gone out upon the walk to escape the heat, and she took her seat behind her desk and gave herself up to a {{consideration}} of the life to which the possession of so much wealth would introduce her. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> have unlimited new gowns, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> travel, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> rescue her mother from drudgery and worry. These <b>things</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> discern--but of the larger life which money could open to her <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only vaguely dream.|$|R
60|$|When Mrs. Cliff returned, {{she asked}} her visitor if {{he would like to}} see her house, and she showed him over it with great satisfaction, for she had filled every room with all the {{handsome}} and appropriate <b>things</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get into it. Burke noticed everything, and spoke with approbation of many things, but as he walked behind his hostess, he kept shaking his head.|$|R
6000|$|Benita {{sank to the}} ground, and {{the next}} <b>thing</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{remember}} was hearing the soft voice of Jacob Meyer, who said: ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was also}} deeply {{interested}} in missions; and one talk {{on this subject}} inspired the Story Girl {{to do a little}} home missionary work on her own account. The only <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> think of, along this line, was to persuade Peter to go to church.|$|E
60|$|She has not got a stage child--if {{she ever}} had one, {{she has left}} it on {{somebody}} else's doorstep which, presuming there was no water handy to drown it in, seems {{to be about the}} most sensible <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have done with it. She is not oppressively good.|$|E
60|$|Catherine {{could think}} of nothing of the kind, and Morris's {{luminosity}} seemed almost pitiless. The only <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> think of was that her father might, after all, come round, and she articulated, with an awkward sense of her helplessness in doing so, a wish that this miracle might happen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never, sir! I took {{good care}} to let nothing come near her that could frighten her--so long, poor little <b>thing,</b> as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do feel sure <b>she</b> <b>could</b> bear more now," [...] said Rosamond, eagerly. [...] "It {{would be}} such a <b>thing</b> if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only be moved about that down-stairs floor." ...|$|R
60|$|It was to this {{somewhat}} unpromising {{haven of}} refuge that Betty's mind now turned in her trouble. She {{did not expect}} great <b>things.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not have said exactly what she did expect. But, at least, the cottage on Staten Island offered a resting-place on her journey, even if {{it could not be}} the journey's end. Her mad dash from Mervo ceased to be objectless. It led somewhere.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wally, it's--" [...] She {{paused for}} a word. [...] "Kind" [...] was horrible. It would have sounded cold, almost supercilious. [...] "Sweet" [...] {{was the sort of}} <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> imagine Lois Denham saying to her friend Izzy. She began her {{sentence}} again. [...] "You're a dear to say that, but...." ...|$|E
60|$|There was one <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do. Anna's tormenting {{suggestion}} {{had fallen}} on fertile soil. Alma balanced pros and cons, admitting the risk. But she {{would have taken a}} tenfold larger risk in the hope of holding secure Anna's place in Gilbert's affections until Anna herself should come to her senses.|$|E
6000|$|... "By Gad, sir," [...] says Barnes, [...] "I {{think it}} is the very best <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do; and the best way of doing it, Ethel can go with one of the boys and take Mrs. What-do-you-call'em a gown, or a tract, or that sort of thing, and stop that infernal Independent's mouth." ...|$|E
5000|$|Biggest part of {{the album}} talks about the romantic kind of love, while the very last one, A Song For My Father, is a song that Emanuela {{dedicated}} to her father, when he died. It is a nostalgic song and she sings about all the <b>things</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not say to him, since when he unexpectedly and prematurely died in Italy she was already living in Los Angeles and {{never had a chance}} to say [...] "goodbye".|$|R
60|$|Mr. Stelling {{liked her}} prattle immensely, {{and they were}} on the best of terms. She told Tom she should like to go to school to Mr. Stelling, as he did, and learn just the same <b>things.</b> <b>She</b> knew <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do Euclid, for she had looked into it again, and she saw what ABC meant--they were the names of the lines.|$|R
6000|$|... "She can't be down there. It's {{a mighty}} curious <b>thing</b> where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have got to, though. Look here, young man, {{are you sure}} you've no idea where your sister is?" ...|$|R
