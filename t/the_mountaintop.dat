5|$|Prospect Mountain {{originally}} {{had to use}} an incline railway car to access {{the house at the}} top where people could dance and eat. Construction on the railway began in January 1895 and cost $120,000 total. Construction was finished six months later, with the railway opening on June15, 1895. After failing financially, the railway system ceased operation in 1903. The area was bought and soon donated to the State of New York. The nearby hiking trail that heads up towards <b>the</b> <b>mountaintop</b> is part of the old railway.|$|E
5|$|Baker, de Francisci, and Moore met in Washington on December 15. At that time, Baker, who {{hoped to}} start Peace dollar {{production}} in 1921, outlined the tight schedule {{for this to}} be accomplished, and requested certain design changes. Among these was the inclusion of the broken sword from the sculptor's alternate reverse design, to be placed under the eagle, on <b>the</b> <b>mountaintop</b> on which it stands, in addition to the olive branch. Baker approved the designs, subject to these changes. The revised designs were presented to President Harding on December 19. Harding insisted on the removal of a small feature of Liberty's face, which seemed to him to suggest a dimple, something he did not consider suggestive of peace, and the sculptor then did so.|$|E

5|$|Villa Real was now {{surrounded}} by hostile territory, and any Spanish help {{was too far}} away to be of value. The colonists quickly ran short of food and responded by taking up arms and riding against the Indians in search of food and slaves. The Indians abandoned their towns and hid their women and children in caves. The rebellious populations concentrated themselves on easily defended mountaintops. At Quetzaltepeque a lengthy battle was fought between the Tzeltal Maya and the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of a number of Spanish as a result of rocks being cast down upon them from <b>the</b> <b>mountaintop.</b> The battle lasted various days, and the Spanish were supported by indigenous warriors from central Mexico. The battle eventually resulted in a Spanish victory, {{but the rest of the}} province of Chiapa remained rebellious.|$|E
5|$|Alejandro Gonzalez Malavé, the {{undercover}} agent who was accompanying the activists, was not indicted {{for his part}} in the slayings because he was granted immunity for testifying against other officers, but was removed from the police force due to public pressure. In February 1986, he was acquitted of kidnapping the taxi driver. His lawyer had argued that he was acting under orders and, therefore, it was the government who was actually guilty of kidnapping. This, despite the testimony presented by officer Carmelo Cruz who had testified that it was Gonzalez who recklessly endangered the hostage's life. The prosecution had provided evidence that he threatened the hostage at gunpoint, drove the car, and, when the car approached <b>the</b> <b>mountaintop,</b> refused to free the hostage despite suggestions from the activists. These actions, according to officer Cruz, were contrary to standard police procedures since his primary concern should have been the safety of the hostage. Nevertheless, the Puerto Rico Police Department did not reinstate Gonzalez as an active police officer, a fact that he publicly expressed resentment over, and subsequently threatened to provide incriminating evidence to the media about other individuals involved in the shootings unless reinstated.|$|E

25|$|In the event, Badenhorst's column blundered {{into the}} British picket {{lines in the}} pre-dawn darkness. In a brief fusillade at close range, the Boers were driven back, with losses on both sides. The alerted British now manned their {{defensive}} positions. Beyer then launched his attack on <b>the</b> <b>mountaintop,</b> but his tired men were soon stopped by sturdy resistance from the Northumberland Fusiliers. After witnessing De la Rey's initial attack being repulsed in the valley below, Beyer's men became inspired and stormed the British positions on <b>the</b> <b>mountaintop.</b> After losing about 100 casualties, Captain Yatman surrendered at about 7:00 am.

25|$|The Boer leaders soon {{agreed on}} a plan. Half of Beyers' men would stay behind to keep Broadwood from marching to the rescue.
