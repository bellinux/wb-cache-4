25|$|Messerschmitt, and {{subsequently}} FMR, made factory-converted Service Cars to {{order for the}} automobile service industry. Similar in concept to the Harley-Davidson Servi-Car and the Indian Dispatch Tow, the Service Car had a detachable <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> and clamp, a revised front suspension to accommodate the <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> when in use, and a storage system inside the car to accommodate the <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> when not in use. The service technician would drive the Service Car to the customer's car and, if the customer's car was drivable, attach the <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> {{to the front of}} the Service Car, clamp the other end of the <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> to the bumper of the customer's car, and drive the customer's car to the garage. When the service was complete, he would drive the car back to the customer while towing the Service Car, detach the Service Car from the customer's car, and drive back to the garage. Approximately 12 were built; only one is known to exist at present.|$|E

50|$|From 1936, the British Army {{began to}} receive Pioneer heavy {{recovery}} vehicles. The first 43 delivered were designated the Pioneer SV1S and the Pioneer SV1T both with a 3-ton folding crane and lockers for recovery equipment and <b>towing</b> <b>bars.</b> Most {{of these early}} Pioneer recovery vehicles were lost with the BEF.|$|R
50|$|Conventional tugs use a <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> {{to connect}} the tug to the nose landing gear of the aircraft. The <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> is fixed {{laterally}} at the nose landing gear, but may move slightly vertically for height adjustment. At the end that attaches to the tug, the <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> may pivot freely laterally and vertically. In this manner the <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> acts as a large lever to rotate the nose landing gear. Each aircraft type has a unique tow fitting so the towbar also acts as an adapter between the standard-sized tow pin on the tug and the type-specific fitting on the aircraft's landing gear. The <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> must be long enough to place the tug far away enough to avoid hitting the aircraft and to provide sufficient leverage to facilitate turns. On heavy tow bars for large aircraft the towbar rides on its own wheels when not connected to an aircraft. The wheels are attached to a hydraulic jacking mechanism which can lift the towbar to the correct height to mate to both the airplane and the tug, and once this is accomplished the same mechanism is used in reverse to raise the <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> wheels from the ground during the pushback process. The <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> can be connected at the front or {{the rear of the}} tractor, depending on whether the aircraft will be pushed or pulled. The towbar has a shear pin which prevents the aircraft from being mishandled by the tug; when overstressed the shear pin will snap, disconnecting the bar from the nose gear to prevent damage to the aircraft and tug.Towbarless tractors do not use a towbar; they scoop up the nose landing gear and lift it off the ground, allowing the tug to maneuver the aircraft. This allows better control of the aircraft and higher speeds; it may also eliminate the need to have a worker in the cockpit to apply the aircraft's brakes. The main advantage of a towbarless tug is simplicity; {{there is no need to}} maintain multiple towbars. The physical action and coordination required by the tug operator to move an aircraft with a TBL tug is simpler and easier to learn than with a tug and towbar. By connecting the tug directly to the aircraft's landing gear tug operators have better control and responsiveness when maneuvering. This is most advantageous in general aviation settings where operators are often required to move more types of aircraft more often into more confined spaces than their airline counterparts.|$|E

50|$|The ODV {{comes in}} four general models, the G-18, G-30, G-60 and G-90. Each vehicle can be fitted with {{attachments}} that convert the ODV into a <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> tractor, a towbarless tractor (the ODAT), snow plow, or rotary broom.|$|E
5000|$|Orbiter Tow Vehicle. This unit is {{very much}} like the typical towing units used for large aircraft. However, it was {{equipped}} with a special <b>towing</b> <b>bar</b> designed specifically for the orbiter. It was used to move the orbiter from the landing facility to the OPF. It also is used for moving the orbiter from the OPF to the VAB.|$|R
5|$|Another rare variant was the Bergepanzer IV armored {{recovery}} vehicle. Some {{were believed}} to have been converted locally, 21 were converted from hulls returned for repair between October 1944 and January 1945. The conversion involved removing the turret and adding a wooden plank cover with an access hatch over the turret ring and the addition of a 2-ton jib crane and rigid <b>towing</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
50|$|On the {{territory}} of Ostafyevo are located certificated maintenance centers for business jets (certifyed by Dassault Aviation for Falcons) and helicopter EC-120B Colibri. Airport complex has 26 open aircraft parkings, 12 of them are within walking distance from the terminal. There are two heated hangar complexes for four aircraft. Places in the hangars are equipped with all the necessary equipment, <b>tow</b> <b>bars</b> are available. Aircraft cleaning services are available. The passenger terminal of the airport can handle up to 70 passengers per hour on domestic routes and 40 passengers per hour - on international flights.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame is}} usually made of steel, {{but can be}} made (whole or in part) of {{aluminum}} for a lighter weight. A <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> may be found attached at one or both ends, but heavy trucks almost always make use of a fifth wheel hitch.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, yard ramps {{normally}} {{incorporate a}} <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> or ramp clamp {{allowing them to}} be quickly and easily moved around on site by forklift {{and placed in a}} new location as required. Their mobile design makes them ideal for small sites where space is a premium, or sites with rapidly changing operations/requirements.|$|E
5000|$|Movement of {{the yard}} ramp - Yard ramps are {{typically}} moved around using a simple <b>tow</b> <b>bar</b> which is pinned into the tow hitch {{on the back of}} most standard fork trucks, though some designs offer alternative methods, such as pushing the ramp around using pockets which accept the standard forks of a fork truck.|$|E
5000|$|On some cars, <b>tow</b> <b>bars</b> may obscure {{one or two}} {{characters}} of the license plate. Bikes on bike racks can also obscure the number plate, though in some countries and jurisdictions, such as Victoria, Australia, [...] "bike plates" [...] {{are supposed to be}} fitted.Some small-scale systems allow for some errors in the license plate. When used for giving specific vehicles access to a barricaded area, the decision may be made to have an acceptable error rate of one character. This is because the likelihood of an unauthorized car having such a similar license plate is seen as quite small. However, this level of inaccuracy would not be acceptable in most applications of an ANPR system.|$|R

50|$|The mortar {{consists}} of a smooth-bored barrel with a breech and a breech-block frame, a frame with shock absorbers, mount with training and equilibrating mechanisms, a two-wheel traveling carriage with the suspension, a boom for changing from the firing to the traveling configuration, a baseplate and a <b>towing</b> <b>bar</b> with a lunette. The sights are carried separately and are mounted on the mortar only when firing. The shock absorbers are used to protect the sights from firing vibrations and also provide {{the link between the}} ordnance and the mount. It is also used when the mounting returns to the loading position after firing. The boom provides stability when firing and also has two winches to convert the mortar from the firing to the traveling configuration.|$|R

50|$|At {{the rear}} of the tank, a tow rope was {{attached}} on top of the sidepod <b>tow</b> <b>bars</b> (A-frame drawbar) attached. The vehicle had an NBC protection system. The maximum tensile load of the main winch was 25 tons, which could be increased with double deflection in the triple train to 75 tons. The cable length was 120 m. The auxiliary winch had 240 feet of rope length. The crane consists of an A-shaped frame, which is mounted {{on the front of the}} vehicle and stored when not in use in {{the rear of}} the structure. The corresponding winch was located behind the crew compartment. The crane at the time of its creation had a lifting capacity of 15 tons at a three meter radius. The lift height was 4.8 m. The crew consisted of commander, driver, observer and two tank mechanics.|$|R
40|$|Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or the {{automatic}} recognition of characters {{is being done}} for quite some years now. In general, very good results have been achieved here. In practice however, various forms of distortion can cause the recognition rate to decrease Automatic License Plate Recognition. For example dirt,drastically. One of the areas this applies to is ALPR or screws or <b>tow</b> <b>bars</b> can cause the license plate and its characters to become partially obscured. Another common problem are fenders that, because of the angle in which some images are taken, cause {{the top of the}} license plate to become obscured. Because of this, the characters become occluded, which means part of their top is cut off. In most cases this results in not recognizing the characters. By building a modular neural network, which includes networks that are especially trained with occluded characters, we can increase the recognition rate drastically. It proves that by using a classifier after the first ttempt to recognize these characters with the traditional network, we can improve our results on recognizing occluded characters without a loss in normal recognition. ...|$|R
