The series sought to highlight confidence issues among people with disabilities. In February 2010 the college secured a £90,000 grant from the Learning and Skills Improvement Service to install a music video production studio enabling bands to record material and showcase their work.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s {{manufacturers}} such as Hummel and Adidas {{began to}} design shirts with increasingly intricate designs, as new technology {{led to the}} introduction of such design elements as shadow prints and pinstripes. Hummel's distinctive halved strip designed for the Danish national team for the 1986 FIFA World Cup caused a stir in the media but FIFA worried about moiré artefacts in television pictures. Shorts became shorter than ever during the 1970s and 1980s, and often included the player's number on the front. In the 1991 FA Cup Final Tottenham Hotspur's players lined up in long baggy shorts. Although, the new look was derided, clubs in Britain and elsewhere had within a short time adopted the longer shorts. In the 1990s shirt designs became increasingly complex, with many teams sporting extremely gaudy colour schemes. Design decisions were increasingly driven by the need for the shirt <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>good</b> when worn by fans as a fashion item, but many designs from this era have since come to be regarded as amongst the worst of all time. In 1996, Manchester United notoriously introduced a grey strip which had been specifically designed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>good</b> when worn with jeans, but abandoned it halfway through a match after manager Alex Ferguson claimed that the reason why his team was losing 3–0 was that the players could not see each other on the pitch. United switched to different colours for the second half and scored one goal without reply. The leading leagues also introduced squad numbers, whereby each player is allocated a specific number for the duration of a season. A brief fad arose for players celebrating goals by lifting or completely removing their shirts to reveal political, religious or personal slogans printed on undershirts. This led to a ruling from the International Football Association Board in 2002 that undershirts must not contain slogans or logos; since 2004 it has been a bookable offence for players to remove their shirts.|$|E

25|$|Boudin and du Pont also competed {{to design}} window {{treatments}} for the Red Room. Boudin suggested straight panels of cerise silk, suspended from a gilded wood rod and rings. Du Pont proposed a lighter treatment of white cotton voile or muslin, drawn {{back from the}} windows with tassels. Mrs. Kennedy was concerned that du Pont's drapes would require constant pressing in order <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>good,</b> and that souvenir-hunters might snip at the tassels and fringe. Boudin's scheme won out.|$|E

500|$|After the Games, Kerry {{retired from}} {{competitive}} swimming. He then worked in Los Angeles {{as a model}} and hosted a fashion show on cable television. According to Tonelli, Kerry's mother told her son to [...] "look after that face, [...] that's all you've got". Tonelli disagreed, opining that [...] "he was always much more than that". Tonelli reported that Kerry was busy preening himself just {{before the start of}} their Olympic-winning relay performance, claiming that although Australia was unlikely to win the race, he needed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>good</b> because a prospective employer might be watching.

500|$|In an {{interview}} 300 writer Frank Miller said, [...] "The inaccuracies, {{almost all of}} them, are intentional. I took those chest plates and leather skirts off of them for a reason. I wanted these guys to move and I wanted 'em <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>good.</b> I knocked their helmets off a fair amount, partly so you can recognize who the characters are. Spartans, in full regalia, were almost indistinguishable except at a very close angle. Another liberty I took was, they all had plumes, but I only gave a plume to Leonidas, to make him stand out and identify him as a king. I was looking for more an evocation than a history lesson. The best result I {{can hope for is}} that if the movie excites someone, they'll go explore the histories themselves. Because the histories are endlessly fascinating." ...|$|E

500|$|The author {{describes}} his experiences {{growing up in}} a church that, despite preaching about grace, did not demonstrate it to others; the church excluded African Americans, dismissed other Christians on the basis of slightly different beliefs, and depicted God as tyrannical and vengeful. Yancey writes, [...] "I grew up with the strong impression that a person became spiritual by attending to grey-area rules," [...] and that church was a place <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>good</b> rather than be honest. He contrasts the teachings of early Christians Pelagius and Augustine of Hippo on the subject of grace, with Pelagius believing that divine grace must be earned and Augustine contending that grace is a gift that cannot be earned. Pelagius was declared a heretic by his peers; Augustine was canonized. According to Yancey, many Christians follow Pelagius's teaching on grace during the week but espouse Augustine's on Sunday.|$|E
500|$|The film entered {{production}} over {{a two-month}} period. Principal photography began in July 2009 {{on a large}} open-air set in Tsuruoka in the Yamagata Prefecture in northern Japan. The filming of the action scenes took about three weeks and was met with minor weather-related difficulties. Miike had strayed {{from the use of}} CGI in the film as well as planning the scenes via storyboarding, insisting on shooting the scenes right away. In a separate interview, however, Miike said that some CGI were used, albeit minimal. Over half of the thirteen actors playing the assassins were reportedly inexperienced in swordfighting and horseback riding, and Miike wanted them to be just that, explaining, [...] "If the actors had been skilled from the beginning, and had been in several samurai movies before, the way they approached the action would've been different; they probably would've ended up being something they were doing <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>good</b> or be beautiful, or to fall into the trappings of the stereotypical form that they had." [...] Filming concluded in early September 2009.|$|E
500|$|However, Becky and Steve {{decide to}} adopt, in a storyline which was {{originally}} meant for Liz McDonald (Bev Callard). It {{was revealed that}} Becky was given the storyline because producer Kim Crowther was determined to feature such a plot. Becky does not like the idea at first thinking she would make a bad mother, later changing her mind. The storyline saw various character changes implemented to Becky, in real life Kelly was forced to reduce {{the length of her}} hair. This was written into scripts to fit with the adoption storyline, which saw Becky changing her wardrobe to fool social workers. Of this Kelly stated: [...] "With the adoption storyline, she borrows Claire Peacock's clothes for a while because she wants <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>good</b> for the social worker coming round. We {{thought it was a good}} opportunity for her to have a slight image change." [...] Kelly further spoke of her admiration of her characters former image adding: [...] "I love Becky with long hair and if it could have been possible I'd have kept her with long blonde hair forever but sometimes nature and practicalities take over!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Gomez's {{appearance}} and portrayal were highlighted by some reviewers. Rap-Up {{called it the}} singer's most intimate video yet, while Idolator's Carl Williott called it [...] "understated". Alyssa Bailey of Elle said the clip was [...] "basically an instruction on how to be hot" [...] and proved [...] "power in vulnerability". Teen Vogue writer Casey Lewis said, [...] "But if she wants <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>good</b> for us, she certainly succeeds...Actually good is an understatement". According to Geller, Gomez was as involved in the clip's overall intimacy as Muller, and her portrayal was [...] "well-played". Geller lauded the visual as [...] "a masterpiece of suggestion", saying that although Gomez's shower scene was [...] "PG-13", it was [...] "still sexy enough to make any respectable fan's tongue hang out". Francesca Bacardi of E! said Gomez should permanently choose her [...] "absolutely gorgeous" [...] natural look sported in the clip.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Video Games" [...] was {{directed}} and edited by Del Rey.

These are interspersed with shots of Del Rey singing, which she filmed herself using a webcam. When asked if she would change anything about the video's production, Del Rey stated, [...] "Had I known {{so many people were}} going to watch the video, I'd have put some more effort into it. I would have got my hair and make-up done and tried not to be so pouty, seeing as everyone talks about my face all the time. And I'd have put more of a storyline into it." [...] The singer also revealed that she was [...] "trying to look smart and well turned-out, rather than 'sexy' [...] Of course I wanted <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>good,</b> but 'smart' was the primary focus." ...|$|E
2500|$|A New York-based firm, {{headed by}} Julie Hughes and Barry Moss, {{was hired to}} find eight young actors to play the camp's staff members. Cunningham admits {{that he was not}} looking for [...] "great actors", but anyone that was likable, and {{appeared}} to be a responsible camp counselor. The way Cunningham saw it, the actors would need <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>good,</b> read the dialogue somewhat well, and work cheap. Moss and Hughes were happy to find four actors, Kevin Bacon, Laurie Bartram, Peter Brouwer, and Adrienne King, who had previously appeared on soap operas. The role of [...] "Alice" [...] was set up as an open casting call, a publicity stunt used to attract more attention to the film. King earned an audition primarily because she was the friend of someone working in Moss and Hughes’s office. After she auditioned, Moss recalls Cunningham commenting that they saved the best actress for last. As Cunningham explains, he was looking for people that could behave naturally, and King was able to show that to him in the audition.|$|E

2500|$|The storyline was set {{up during}} 1988, as Kathy found {{employment}} at James's wine bar, [...] "The Dagmar", causing friction between Kathy and her husband Pete who [...] "didn't like the pub, the clientele or the clothes Kathy felt she had to wear <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>good</b> for work". As James struggled with various personal and business issues simultaneously, he began to show an attraction to Kathy, leading to the storyline's eventual climax, Kathy's rape. Writer Colin Brake has commented that [...] "all the pieces [...] in place [...] Pete was away [...] Willmott-Brown asked Kathy to stay after work for a drink. The situation {{got out of hand}} and what began as seduction ended in rape." [...] The episodes covering the rape were written by Tony McHale and are considered by the writer Colin Brake as [...] "EastEnders at its best". Some 19 million viewers tuned in to see Kathy attacked in The Dagmar wine bar's upstairs flat, on 7 July 1988, in episode 357, reportedly 2 million more than the average viewership at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Guiteau {{felt that}} God {{told him to}} kill the president; he felt that such an act would be a [...] "removal" [...] {{as opposed to an}} assassination. He felt that Garfield needed to be killed to rid the Republican Party of Blaine. Borrowing $15 from a Mr. Maynard, Guiteau went out to {{purchase}} a revolver. He knew little about firearms, but did know that he would need a large caliber gun. He had to choose between a [...]442 Webley caliber British Bulldog revolver with wooden grips or one with ivory grips. He chose the one with the ivory handle because he wanted it <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>good</b> as a museum exhibit after the assassination. Though he could not afford the extra dollar, the store owner dropped the price for him. He spent the next few weeks in target practice – the recoil from the revolver almost knocked him over the first time – and stalking Garfield. The revolver was recovered after the assassination, and even photographed by the Smithsonian in the early 20th century, but it has since been lost.|$|E
2500|$|Tiffany was {{described}} as a [...] "practical feminist" [...] who would always get her man. James explained the description, saying: [...] "She wants to further her own goals, but she's not afraid of using her femininity to do so. She wants equality, but she recognises {{there is a difference between}} men and women and how they operate. She wants <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>good</b> and wear make-up and she can get very emotionally entangled sometimes." [...] She has also landed the label of a [...] "hot party girl". Tiffany's rivalry with Emily helped James understand Tiffany's characterisation, she stated; [...] "It challenged Tiffany. She always expects people to want to be beautiful. It showed me the naivete about Tiffany that I hadn't seen before. She assumes that she knows how everyone thinks and what everyone else wants from life, but then you realise she's possibly quite skewed and self-centred. It's obviously such a big part of Tiffany's life that it over-rides everything else. She's not brainless, it's just her priorities. James described her as, [...] "very heroic" [...] and believed that she, [...] "always puts up a fight for the underdog." ...|$|E
