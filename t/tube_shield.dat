A trouble was encountered making good work conditions of a system consisting of the drilling machine drill string reamer swivel <b>tube</b> <b>shield</b> of Cardan joint and the gas pipeline 500 m long. In this case, the swivel brokes down and the planned operation was not finished. The assessment of improper drilling conditions, selection of operation system components, and drilling parameters and the insufficient technological supervising have created an excessive risk of failure. A proper application of technical analysis would considerably decrease the hazard of failure which cause large costs, delays and decrease of confidence to the drilling contractor and pipeline installation...|$|E

5000|$|A {{problem with}} the TRF {{receiver}} built with triode vacuum tubes was the triode's interelectrode capacitance. The interelectrode capacitance allowed energy in the output circuit to feedback into the input. That feedback could cause instability and oscillation that would frustrate reception and produce squealing or howling noises in the speaker. In 1922, Louis Alan Hazeltine invented the technique of neutralization that uses additional circuitry to partially cancel {{the effect of the}} interelectrode capacitance. Neutralization was used in the popular Neutrodyne series of TRF receivers. Under certain conditions, [...] "the neutralization is substantially independent of frequency over a wide frequency band." [...] "Perfect neutralization cannot be maintained in practice over a wide band of frequencies because leakage inductances and stray capacities" [...] are not completely canceled. [...] The later development of the tetrode and pentode vacuum tubes minimized the effect of interelectrode capacitances and could make neutralization unnecessary; the additional electrodes in those <b>tubes</b> <b>shield</b> the plate and grid and minimize feedback.|$|R

40|$|A superconducting tube {{can be used}} as an {{efficient}} magnetic shield. The best shielding performance levels are usually achieved when the tube is closed at one or both extremities. The purpose of the present work is to study experimentally the shielding performance of YBCO tubes obtained by Buffer-aided Top Seeded Melt Growth fabrication process (BA-TSMG). This fabrication process enables the tube to be closed at one extremity by a cap containing the seed and there is no air gap between the cap and the <b>tube.</b> The <b>shielding</b> effectiveness is characterized by two parameters: (i) the shielding factor, defined as the ratio between the applied magnetic induction and the local magnetic induction measured inside the shield, and (ii) the threshold induction, i. e. the applied magnetic induction above which a given value of the shielding factor cannot be achieved. The magnetic <b>shielding</b> performances of <b>tubes</b> with different geometry are characterized at 77 K in liquid nitrogen. Further magnetic shielding measurements are carried out on one tube at various temperatures ranging from 20 K to 77 K using a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). The tubes are subjected to a quasi-static (“DC”) uniform magnetic field. A Hall probe measures the axial component of the local magnetic induction along the axis of the tube {{as a function of the}} applied magnetic induction. In order to investigate how the cap prevents the magnetic flux from penetrating inside the tube, we also characterize open tubes where the cap is removed and compare their properties to those of closed <b>tubes.</b> Magnetic <b>shielding</b> measurements show that the threshold induction increases by a factor of 9 as temperature decreases from 77 K to 20 K. Measurements also show that the presence of the cap improves the shielding performance at the closed extremity of the order of 1000 as it reduces the penetration through the open end. Near the closed extremity, a threshold induction of 1. 5 T was reached at 20 K. To our knowledge this threshold induction is the best value reported so far at 20 K, and is comparable in magnitude to the record threshold inductions reported for bulk MgB 2 and Bi- 2212 materials at lower temperatures. These results give evidence that efficient magnetic shields can be obtained with this fabrication technique...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory has {{recently}} finished its {{third and final}} phase, and has accumulated over 1082 days of neutrino data, spanning the energy range from approximately 5 - 20 MeV. Almost all the observed neutrinos are due to the 8 B reaction in the Sun. The so-called hep process (3 He + p → 4 He + e + + νe) also occurs in the Sun, but {{has not yet been}} observed. The hep neutrino energy endpoint extends above the 8 B spectrum. This paper describes the three phase analysis that will ultimately be the most sensitive to this reaction. 1. SNO Overview The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory is located near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, two kilometres underground in Vale INCO’s Creighton mine.

40|$|We have {{experimentally}} {{studied the}} magnetic shielding properties of a cylindrical shell of BiPbSrCaCuO subjected to low frequency AC axial magnetic fields. The magnetic {{response has been}} investigated {{as a function of}} the dimensions of the tube, the magnitude of the applied field and the frequency. These results are explained quantitatively by employing the method of Brandt (1998 Phys. Rev. B 58 6506) with a Jc(B) law appropriate for a polycrystalline material. Specifically, we observe that the applied field can sweep into the central region either through the thickness of the shield or through the opening ends, the latter mechanism being suppressed for long tubes. For the first time, we systematically detail the spatial variation of the shielding factor (the ratio of the applied field over the internal magnetic field) along the axis of a high-temperature superconducting <b>tube.</b> The <b>shielding</b> factor is shown to be constant in a region around the centre of the tube, and to decrease as an exponential in the vicinity of the ends. This spatial dependence comes from the competition between two mechanisms of field penetration. The frequency dependence of the shielding factor is also discussed and shown to follow a power law arising from the finite creep exponent n. Comment: 22 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|Results of a {{study to}} {{evaluate}} the suitability of passive samplers for the measurement of monthly averaged ammonia concentrations are presented. Five different samplers were tested. Four were diffusion tube samplers which differed in length {{and in the way}} they were modified to minimize disturbing effects of wind turbulence. Also tested was a badge-type passive sampler. Measurements were carried out at five sites and in a small wind tunnel. The concentrations ranged from 1 to 35 μg m- 3. Precision of the samplers was derived from triplicate measurements and the accuracy by comparison with results of a reference method. Two types of tubes proved to be suitable for the purpose. One is a 71. 2 mm long tube provided with a stainless-steel grid in the inlet and mounted in a cylindrical container against wind influences. The other is a 35. 6 mm long tube with a permeable membrane in the inlet, mounted in the shield as well as exposed just in the open air. The shorter <b>tube</b> without <b>shield</b> is preferred because of its higher effective uptake rate and the simple way it can be operated.

40|$|The {{contributions}} of Cerenkov emission, luminescence, secondary electron emission, and bremsstrahlung to radiation-induced data current and noise of multiplier phototubes were analyzed quantitatively. Fluorescence and Cerenkov emission in the tube window {{are the major}} contributors and can quantitatively account for dark count levels observed in orbit. Radiation-induced noise can be minimized by <b>shielding,</b> <b>tube</b> selection, and mode of operation. Optical decoupling of windows and cathode (side-window tubes) leads to further reduction of radiation-induced dark counts, as does reducing the window thickness and effective cathode area, and selection of window/cathode combinations of low fluorescence efficiency. In trapped radiation-free regions of near-earth orbits and in free space, Cerenkov emission by relativistic particles contributes predominantly to the photoelectron yield per event.

50|$|For the {{comparison}} of two currents these are fed through two wires which are led through a superconducting tube.

The signal of this null detector thus is a measure for the equality of the currents; in particular it is zero if the two currents are of exactly equal magnitude.
