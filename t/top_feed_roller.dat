40|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} have been made to monitor cane yield variation across a block in Australia. These have ranged from the early yield monitoring systems based on discrete mass measurement, to the current focus of predicting yield via surrogate measurements based on chopper pressure, feed train roller displacement and elevator power. Recent work aimed at assessing commercially available sensors (Jensen et al. 2010) suggested that there were several areas in which there was room for marked improvement. Rather than testing commercially available sensors, this paper details the testing that was conducted on evaluating the measurement concept. These concepts included; the pressure drop across the elevator and chopper motors, a load cell in the elevator floor and the angle of opening of the <b>top</b> <b>feed</b> <b>roller.</b> These concepts cover those being employed in the commercial units, both past and present. Trials were conducted during the 2010 season in the Bundaberg region and in both the Bundaberg and Herbert regions in 2011. Campbell Scientific CR 3000 dataloggers were used to read each of the sensors at 40 Hz and record the averaged value every second, along with the GPS information. In addition to this sensor data, sugarcane yield was also measured to determine the accuracy and resolution of the respective yield monitoring concepts. Yield was determined using two methods and included mill (bin) weight data for individually consigned sub-blocks and weighed 50 m row samples into a weigh truck. The approach used was consistent with the methodology previously developed to assess the accuracy of commercial yield monitoring equipment during 2008 / 09. Preliminary analysis indicates that there are considerable similarities between the yield monitoring concepts in terms of their ability to measure yield, and that how the sensor data is recorded and managed is critical to the accuracy and overall performance of these concepts as yield monitors. This paper reports on the findings of this work and makes recommendations for further refining the devices and for additional work. ...|$|E

40|$|A common {{method of}} feeding the stock {{material}} into the press is bypassing it through a pair of <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> which apply friction to the material and rotate in a cooperative manner to feed the stock in to the punch press. By synchronizing {{the rotation of the}} <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> to the speed of the press,the stock material is fed in to the punch press at the proper rate. Stepping motors are widely used in robotics and in the numerical control of machine tools to perform high precision positioning operations. The principal object of this invention is to provide a strip stock feeding mechanism that is suitable for feeding any desired length of stock for each cycle and which may be very easily adjusted for various lengths of feed. It was found that cost of stepper feeder is quite less as compared to other types of feeder available in the market...|$|R
50|$|A burster is {{a machine}} that {{separates}} one-part continuous form paper into separate, individual, sheets along the transverse perforations. A burster was typically used with printed continuous form paper applications such as mass-mail advertising, invoices, and account statements. Bursting is done by firmly gripping the second-to-last sheet while <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> grip the last sheet firmly and pull it away to burst the perforation. The continuous form paper then advances into the <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> to burst the next sheet. Bursting is often a high-speed process that allows the continuous form paper to feed in at a steady rate, with burst pages either stacked or fed into a single-sheet conveyance to the next paper processing stage. Burster equipment and paper manufactures had to generate perforation specifications so that the paper perforations reliably separated under the force of pulling the sheets apart and not tear down into the printed part of the sheet.|$|R
40|$|A field-based {{study was}} {{performed}} to broaden our knowledge of operational efficiency losses associated with the neglect of the proper maintenance of the delimbing and feeding mechanisms of a harvester. The post-harvest assessments of industrial round-wood (IRW) processing damage, fuel consumption and productivity were examined in clearcutting operations. Observations were made of seven combinations of wear levels of <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> (A—heavy, B—medium, C and C’—without wear) and sharpening states of delimbing knives (1 —incorrect, 2 —correct), depending {{on the degree of}} <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> wear and matching of angles of knife blades to the technical requirements. The processing defects of IRW were broken down into unprocessed branches, bark stripping, and damage caused by <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> spikes. The results were then compared with the effective quality requirements, and the IRW losses in terms of the reject rates (RR) were determined {{in the context of the}} technical condition. The most frequent damage was by unprocessed branches. The harvester with correctly sharpened knives produced the minimum RR (4 % of pine, 6 % of spruce and 6 % birch logs). The quality of IRW harvested under B 1 and C 1 resulted in 6 %, 6 % and 8 %. A 1 turned out to be the lowest (12 %, 10 % and 8 %). Improvement in the maintenance of delimbing knives can reduce the RR of IRW by 5 %. Timely restoration of worn-out rollers can increase productivity by 2 % and reduce fuel consumption by 5 %...|$|R

40|$|Rotor spun yarn, {{despite its}} growing popularity, suffers the {{disadvantages}} of lower tenacity, limited count range, and harsh {{handle of the}} resulting fabrics. Therefore, this work probes the possibility of eliminating these drawbacks by using tensile drawing. The yarns are produced with different specifications from the same fibers. The results are encouraging, since contrary to predictions, staple yarns treated this way do perform properly. Tensile drawing especially improves rotor spun yarn quality in terms of structural/mechanical evenness and processability. Other features include increased packing density, reduced yarn diameter, enhanced mechanical rigidity, and even the potential for larger tenacity. The influence of processing variables on yarn properties is also revealed by examining {{the contribution of the}} number of yarn loops mounted on the <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> and rewinding to drawing and the resulting products. The number of yarn loops wound on the <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> is significant in terms of drawing tension. Optimum drawing can be obtained without rewinding in terms of better yarn properties and economics, though rewinding can effectively eliminate fiber breakage. Moreover, the truely critical factor in the drawing extent should be drawing tension rather than the so-called drawing ratio. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|Issue: Windshields are {{manufactured}} with {{two layers of}} glass with a strong plastic (usually PVC) membrane sandwiched between the panes. This structure limits recyclability dramatically. Plate glass itself is challenging to recycle because of its different chemical composition from container glass. Plate glass and automotive glass can be successfully recycled into construction aggregate or other secondary markets if the glass can {{be separated from the}} film. Separating film plastic from windshield glass requires that the glass be broken adequately to free the film, while keeping the film in large enough pieces that it can be removed without fouling equipment. Best Practice: Systems are now available to crush windshields and screen film plastic residuals in a turnkey system. In one system, compression <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> are used to guide windshields through a processing system at a predetermined rate and physical orientation. The system is 70 inches long, 50 inches wide and 56 inches high.

The test setup consisted of six boilers equipped with bottom feed burner (BF), one with <b>top</b> <b>feed</b> (TF) and two with horizontally feed burner (HF). Wood pellets used as fuel were DINplus certified. In real life conditions, 20 Â kW bottom feed boiler had the best performance. Emissions of dust from bottom and horizontal feed boilers were better in real life conditions than in standard laboratory conditions. All boiler technologies had lower combustion efficiencies in real life condition (2 - 5 % less) than in standard laboratory condition. <b>Top</b> <b>feed</b> boiler emitted maximum CO (1566 Â mgÂ NÂ m- 3); and dust particles from concerned boiler contained {{a considerable amount of}} elemental carbon.

In laboratory conditions, all bottom feed boilers satisfied emissions and efficiency requirements of Blue Angel, however, in real life situation only 20 Â kW bottom feed and horizontal feed boilers could meet the concerned requirements.
