40|$|Background: Hymenolepis diminuta is a cestod of rodents {{and rarely}} infects humans. Infection in humans is via {{ingestion}} of infected insects. This study was aimed to detect H. diminuta cysticercoids in <b>red</b> <b>flour</b> <b>beetles,</b> Tribolium castaneum, and cockroaches originated from {{different regions of}} Iran. Methods: <b>The</b> <b>red</b> <b>flour</b> <b>beetles</b> and cockroaches were collected from local bakeries in five cities including Tehran, Ahvaz, Kazerun, and Sabzevar during 2010 – 2011. Some beetles and cockroaches were colonized in insectary and adults from F 1 generation were fed on H. diminuta eggs. Both laboratory-infected and field-collected samples were dissected and examined for cysticercoids. Detection of H. diminuta DNA in T. castaneum beetles was performed by targeting a partial sequence of Ribosomal gene. Results: Except the beetles from Ahvaz, all specimens were negative for cysticercoid by microscopy. Of the four dissected beetles from Ahvaz, one harbored 12 cysticercoids. Also, 110 (52 %) of laboratory-infected beetles showed infection {{with an average of}} 12 – 14 larvae. None of the cockroaches was infected. Two beetles from Ahvaz, includ­ing the remainder of the microscopic positive specimen, yielded the expected amplicon in PCR assay. The H. diminuta DNA sequences generated in this study were identical and matched 97 – 100 % with similar sequences from GenBank database. Conclusion: Lack of infection in the majority of beetles may reflect a low rat infestation rate in those areas, alternatively, the examined specimens might not have been the representative samples of the T. castaneum populations. </p...|$|R
2500|$|Adjacent sperm storage organs: [...] Females can {{sometimes}} store sperm in adjacent organs, {{especially when they}} mate multiply and thus give unequal preference to certain males. [...] In many polygamous species, males often {{have the ability to}} displace a previous male's sperm. [...] In response to this, females retain control of sperm choice by using multiple sperm storage sites to exercise cryptic female choice. [...] By moving sperm to adjacent organs females can prevent particular sperm from being displaced and save the displaced sperm for fertilization. Moving the sperm can also prevent it from continuing on in the fertilization process. [...] In the Dryomiza anilis fly and in the flour beetle, females choose sperm from [...] a number of different storage locations.

2500|$|Cucumeropsis mannii is {{reported}} to be pest and disease free. [...] Primary issues include the fungus Macrophomina phaseolina which attacks the roots and lower stems of the crop causing damping-off disease. The fruit fly species Dacus punctifrons may also attack the fruit of this plant. The fruit generally rots due to the existence of larvae. Halticus tibialis is a flea hopper similar to an aphid and may also cause problems for egusi-itoo crops, often killing the leaves of the plant by sucking out sap. After harvesting many beetle species including <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> and the cigarette beetle may feed on seeds which are not properly stored in air-tight containers [...] Cucumeropsis mannii provides ground cover, effectively suppressing weeds. Intercropping with sorghum, cassava, coffee, cotton, maize, or banana crops can reduce weedings during the growing season from 2-3 to just one. This has significant positive effects on the female farmer who spends the majority of her time weeding.|$|E

40|$|Fumigation with {{phosphine}} gas is {{the primary}} method of controlling stored grain pests. In Turkey, phosphine has been used extensively since the 1950 's.

40|$|In insects, the {{boundary}} between the embryonic head and thorax is formed by the dorsal ridge, a fused structure composed of portions of the maxillary and labial segments. However, the mechanisms that promote development of this unusual structure remain a mystery. In Drosophila, mutations in the Hox genes Sex combs reduced and Deformed have been reported to cause abnormal dorsal ridge formation, but the significance of these abnormalities is not clear. We have identified three mutant allele classes of Cephalothorax, <b>the</b> Tribolium castaneum (<b>red</b> <b>flour</b> <b>beetle)</b> ortholog of Sex combs reduced, each of which has a different effect on dorsal ridge development. By using Engrailed expression to monitor dorsal ridge development in these mutants, we demonstrate that Cephalothorax promotes the fusion and subsequent dorsolateral extension of the maxillary and labial Engrailed stripes (posterior compartments) during dorsal ridge formation. Molecular and genetic analysis of these alleles indicates that the N terminus of Cephalothorax is important for the fusion step, but is dispensable for Engrailed stripe extension. Thus, we find that specific regions of Cephalothorax are required for discrete steps in dorsal ridge formation...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{emergence}} of heritable high level resistance to phosphine in stored grain pests {{is a serious}} concern among major grain growing countries around the world. Here we describe the genetics of phosphine resistance in <b>the</b> rust <b>red</b> <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), a pest of stored grain {{as well as a}} genetic model organism. We investigated three field collected strains of T. castaneum viz., susceptible (QTC 4), weakly resistant (QTC 1012) and strongly resistant (QTC 931) to phosphine. The dose-mortality responses of their test- and inter-cross progeny revealed that most resistance was conferred by a single major resistance gene in the weakly (3. 2 ×) resistant strain. This gene was also found in the strongly resistant (431 ×) strain, together with a second major resistance gene and additional minor factors. The second major gene by itself confers only 12 - 20 × resistance, suggesting that a strong synergistic epistatic interaction between the genes is responsible for the high level of resistance (431 ×) observed in the strongly resistant strain. Phosphine resistance is not sex linked and is inherited as an incompletely recessive, autosomal trait. The analysis of the phenotypic fitness response of a population derived from a single pair inter-strain cross between the susceptible and strongly resistant strains indicated the changes in the level of response in the strong resistance phenotype; however this effect was not consistent and apparently masked by the genetic background of the weakly resistant strain. The results from this work will inform phosphine resistance management strategies and provide a basis for the identification of the resistance genes...|$|R

A sampling method consists of selecting the best device or collection technique for a specific location and sampling at the proper spatial distribution, optimal duration, and frequency to achieve the surveillance objective.

50|$|Two {{different}} types of beetles are classified as flour beetles: <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> and the confused flour beetle. Both are similar in physical characteristics. They are flat and oval in shape and usually range around 1/8 inch long. Their exoskeletons are reddish brown with a shiny and smooth texture. The eggs, larvae, and pupae resemble each other closely in physical features, as well. The eggs usually {{tend to be a}} white color, or at times even colorless. They are very small in size and have a sticky outer covering that causes certain food particles to stick to them. The larvae have six legs, with two pointy projections toward the caudal end. Finally, the pupal stage (a cocoon-like form) is usually a white or brownish color. The beetle life cycle lasts about three years or more, with the larval stage ranging anywhere from 20 to over 100 days, and the pupal stage around eight days. Beetles usually breed in damaged grain, grain dust, high-moisture wheat kernels and flour. The female flour beetle can lay between 300 and 400 eggs during her lifetime period of 5 to 8 months. The flour beetles mainly infest grains, including, but not limited to: cereal, corn meal oats, rice, flour, and crackers. This type of beetle is the most abundant insect pest of flour mills across the United States. Their small size allows them to maneuver through cracks and crevices and get into the home and other areas. Once they are present in areas with potential food sources, they can infest material such as flour, resulting in a sharp odor or moldy flavor. <b>The</b> <b>red</b> <b>flour</b> <b>beetle</b> is able to fly short distances and the confused flour beetle is unable to fly. While the confused flour beetle is more commonly found in the northern United States, the red flour beetles are more predominant in the southern United States in areas with warmer climates.The red flour beetle and the confused flour beetle are commonly used as a model organisms, to study genetics and ecology.
