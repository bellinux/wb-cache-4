(1) The past self-disclosure on topics of low intimacy values will not correlate to the self-disclosure and the self-concealment in a group work. (2) The past self-disclosure on topics of high intimacy values will correlate positively to the self-disclosure and negatively to the self-concealment in a groupwork. (3) The willingness to disclose self in a group work will correlate positively to the self-disclosure and negatively to the self-concealment in a groupwork. (4) The willingness to disclose self on topics of high intimacy values will correlate more highly to the self-discloure and the self-concealment in a group work than the willingness to disclose on topics of low intimacy values. Almost all the correlations obtained seemed to have tendencies to support the hypotheses with no contradiction. But, only some parts of correlations were statistically significant.
