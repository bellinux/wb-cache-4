This equipment {{is also used}} in the carbonic gas treatment, a by-product from the sugar cane fermentation. In the present work. the development of nonlinear feed forward-feedback controllers, based on neural network inverse models, was proposed and tested to manipulate the absorbent flow rates The control purposes are to keep low ethanol concentration in the effluent gas phase from the first absorption column (ethanol recovery column), and to reduce the residual water concentration in the CO(2) gas effluent from the second tower (CO(2) <b>treatment</b> <b>column).</b> Based oil simulation studies, the neural network (ANN) controller performance was compared with the conventional PID control scheme application. The best ANN architecture was set up according to the Foresse and Hagan (1997) criterion. while the PID parameters were found from the well-known Cohen-Coon Equations and trial-and-error fine tuning. Initially, performances were evaluated for the system without concentration measurement uncertainties. From these tests, the ANN controller presented the smallest response time and overshoot for regulator and servo problems Three uncertainty levels were applied afterwards: 5 %, 10 %, and 15 %. The ANN controller Outperformed the PID for all uncertainty levels tested for the ethanol recovery column. For the CO(2) <b>treatment</b> <b>column.</b> the ANN controller proceeded successfully under uncertainties of 5 % and 10 %, while the PID did not deal properly with uncertainties above 5 % The statistical F-test, besides the ITAE, ISE, and IAE performance criteria, were calculated for both controllers applications and then compared They proved {{the superiority of the}} ANN control scheme. Using appropriately the proposed well-controlled absorption columns increases the efficiency of rile bioethanol production plant and can also provide carbon credits by avoiding CO(2) emission into the atmosphere (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserve...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that utilising a vertical flow (VF) wetland after a conventional activated sludge (CAS) delivers equivalent or better effluent quality to a membrane bioreactor (MBR) {{based on a}} side-by-side pilot trial. The CAS was operated under the solids retention times (SRT) of 6, 12, and 20 days, with the effluent from each pilot plant fed onto a soil aquifer <b>treatment</b> <b>column</b> to better understand their water reuse application potential. Results showed an upgraded CAS + VF system could deliver effluents with median values of 34 mgO 2. L– 1, 7 mg. L– 1 and 1. 9 mg.

Water reuse standards were achieved by the upgraded system for most parameters, {{with the exception of}} total coliform removal. The upgraded system delivered superior metal removal when compared to the CAS. An economic analysis showed upgrading a CAS with a VF wetland was more favourable than investing in an MBR system for example works of 5000 and 50, 000 population equivalents if the VF system was operated at hydraulic loading rates of 0. 03 m. d– 1 and 0. 08 m. d– 1, respectively.

40|$|Mercury (Hg) is a toxic element which bioaccumulates in {{the food}} chain when {{methylated}} and poses a health risk to the human population mainly through fish consumption. It is released into the environment through both natural and anthropogenic processes. Remediation of river systems contaminated with Hg presents challenges due to complexities associated with dynamic transport and deposition processes and cyclic methylation. The South River watershed in Virginia, USA contains elevated concentrations of Hg within sediment and floodplain soils {{as a result of}} historical releases from a textile manufacturing plant from 1929 - 1950. Methylation of Hg is a bacterially mediated process which is controlled by the availability of electron donors, electron acceptors and Hg, amongst other factors. To evaluate the factors controlling Hg methylation at the South River site, four column experiments were conducted that involved saturating site sediments with South River water, followed by subjecting the columns to influent solution containing differing organic carbon and sulfate amendments. These amendments included acetate, lactate, and lactate combined with excess SO 42 - and the production of MeHg relative to a control was monitored both spatially and temporally. Production of MeHg was observed in all four columns, with the lowest mass found in the effluent generated by the control column (8. 7 ng L- 1), and a slightly higher mass in the acetate and lactate amended column effluents (53. 7 ng L- 1 and 30. 1 ng L- 1 reached respectively). The aqueous MeHg in the column amended with lactate and SO 42 - reached a maximum of 4910 ng L- 1 near the output of the column. The results from these column experiments suggest that excess SO 42 - did not inhibit methylation under saturated flow conditions in the South River sediments. The bacterial species Desulfovibrio putealis, Geobacter spp., Desulfobacterium and Desulfosporosinus were identified in the column sediments and are potential contributors to the observed Hg methylation. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential removal of Hg and MeHg from sediment pore water. The experiments consisted of two columns connected in series. The first column contained Hg-bearing sediment with South River water as an influent solution to provide a source of Hg for the <b>treatment</b> <b>column.</b> The effluent from the first column was then connected to a <b>treatment</b> <b>column</b> which contained 1 : 1 volume ratio of biochar and silica sand. This <b>treatment</b> <b>column</b> was loaded with Hg for 182 pore volumes, disconnected, and then subjected to new influent solutions consisting of first background river water and then simulated acid rain water. The purpose was to determine the potential of the biochar material to retain Hg under saturated flow conditions. No significant release of Hg was observed in the column effluent with the South River water. After the influent was switched to simulated acid rain water (pH ~ 4. 6), there was an increase in Hg concentrations in the column effluent for one sampling period, but then the unfiltered and 0. 45 m filtered Hg concentrations returned to < 8. 5 ng L- 1. Total Hg extractions on the biochar column material at four locations suggested {{that the majority of the}} Hg in the column resided in the first 5 cm of material even after influent perturbations, with a maximum of 0. 26 g g- 1 dry weight in the 2 cm closest to the influent. Mercury sequential extraction results on the biochar material at the termination of the column revealed the majority (67 %) of the Hg on the biochar material was removed with 12 M HNO 3 (F 4 fraction), followed by 0. 1 M KOH (F 3 fraction) at 31 %. Less than 1. 2 % of the THg was removed after subjecting the biochar material to deionized water (F 1 fraction) and 0. 01 M HCl + 0. 1 M CH 3 COOH (F 2 fraction). A solid-phase analysis of MeHg on the same biochar material resulted in a concentration of 0. 20 ng g- 1 dry weight, or < 0. 08 % of total solid-phase Hg. These results suggest that application of biochar may represent an effective approach for treating Hg in passive flow through systems. 1 yea...|$|E

At the Tehran Oil Refining Company (TORC), with critical problem of soil and groundwater pollution, finding a suitable remediation method has been a big concern. As bioremediation {{is one of the most}} economically and technically attractive decontamination methods, it was chosen for preliminary study to solve this problem. For simulation of the region, soil column treatment method by using oil habituated indigenous microorganisms of the area was selected. The main purpose was assessing the suitability of bioremediation method in the target area for treatment of capillary fringe layer. Two columns (one as <b>treatment</b> <b>column</b> and the other as a control) were designed and the variation of different parameters including dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, the number of viable and active microorganisms (CFU/mL), and biodegradation rate during 30 working days were recorded. The experiments showed that a major part of degrading microorganisms were facultative anaerobic. pH was not an inhibiting factor and the number of active microorganisms was increasing during aeration time. The results of solvent extraction method also revealed that during 30 days, about 6 % of total petroleum hydrocarbon in columns was biologically degraded. Finally, it was disclosed that bioremediation method could be effective in solving the area's pollution problem. However, new studies should be conducted to optimize the biodegradation rate and extrapolate from the laboratory scale results to the field ones. M. Zargar, M. H. Sarrafzadeh, B. Taheri, and A.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 This {{study is}} compososed of two parts. In {{the first part}} of this dissertation, the {{large-scale}} circulation features that determine the structure and evolution of MJO- related moisture and precipitation fields are examined using a linear analysis protocol based on daily 850 - minus 150 -hPa global velocity potential data. The analysis is aug- mented by a compositing procedure that emphasizes the structural features over the Indo-Pacific warm pool sector (60 ◦E− 180 ◦) that give rise to the eastward propagation of the enhanced moisture and precipitation. It is found that boundary layer (BL) convergence in the low level easterlies to the east of the region of maximum ascent produces a deep but narrow plume of equa- torial ascent that moistens the mid-troposphere, while weakly diffluent flow above the BL spreads moisture away from the equator. Vertical advection of moisture from this plume of ascent accounts for the eastward propagation of the positive mois- ture anomalies across the Maritime Continent into the western Pacific. When the convection is first developing over the Indian Ocean, horizontal moisture advection contributes to both the eastward propagation and the amplification of the positive moisture anomalies along the equator to the east of the region of enhanced convection. The results of {{the first part of}} the dissertation are used to develop a linear wave theory for the MJO, shown in part two. The theory is largely based on a framework previously developed by Sobel and Maloney. In this <b>treatment,</b> <b>column</b> moisture is the only prognostic variable and the horizontal wind is diagnosed as the forced Kelvin and Rossby wave responses to an equatorial heat source/sink. In contrast to the original framework, the meridional and vertical structure of the basic equations are treated explicitly, and values of several key model parameters are adjusted, based on observations. A dispersion relation is derived that adequately describes the MJO’s signal in the wavenumber-frequency spectrum and defines the MJO as a dispersive equatorial moist wave with a westward group velocity. On the basis of linear regression analysis of satellite and reanalysis data, it is estimated that the MJO’s group velocity is ∼ 40 % as large as its phase speed. This dispersion is the result of the anomalous winds in the wave modulating the mean distribution of moisture such that the moisture anomaly propagates eastward while wave activity propagates westward. The moist wave grows through feedbacks involving moisture, clouds and radia- tion, and is damped by the advection of moisture associated with the Rossby wave. Additionally, a zonal wavenumber dependence is found in cloud-radiation feedbacks which causes growth to be strongest at planetary scales. Our results suggest that this wavenumber dependence arises from the non-local nature of cloud-radiation feed- backs; that is, anomalous convection spreads upper-level clouds and reduces radiative cooling over an extensive area surrounding the anomalous precipitation...|$|E

40|$|The {{persistence}} and widespread occurrence of emerging contaminants (ECs) such as perchlorate (ClO 4 -), pharmaceutical compounds, artificial sweeteners, and perfluoroalkyl substances {{in the environment}} has received increasing attention due to the adverse effects on human health and aquatic ecosystems they may cause. Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) collect household sewage which contains various types of ECs. Emerging contaminants are consequently released to the environment due to incomplete removal of the ECs in the WWTPs. These ECs have been widely found in treated wastewater, surface water, groundwater, and even drinking water at concentrations ranging from ng L- 1 to µg L- 1. This thesis describes laboratory experiments for evaluating the effectiveness of passive treatment systems and photocatalytic technologies for removing these ECs from water. In addition, a field investigation is described for tracking wastewater downstream of WWTPs using potential tracers in a receiving river. Laboratory column experiments were performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of reactive media zero-valent iron (ZVI), organic carbon (OC, wood chips), and a mixture of (ZVI + OC) for simultaneous removal of NO 3 -, SO 42 -, and ClO 4 - from contaminated water associated with mining and blasting sites. Input NO 3 - (~ 10. 8 mg L- 1 NO 3 -N) was effectively removed through NO 3 - reduction to NH 4 + in Column ZVI, through denitrification in Column OC, and through the combination of NO 3 - reduction by ZVI and denitrification by OC in Column (ZVI + OC). Input SO 42 - (~ 24. 5 mg L- 1) was partially removed (up to 71 %) in Column OC through biologically mediated SO 42 - reduction coupled to OC oxidation. Biological degradation of ClO 4 - (input concentration: ~ 860 μg L- 1) to Cl- was observed in the columns containing OC, but not ZVI. Removals of NO 3 -, SO 42 -, and ClO 4 - within three treatment columns was enhanced as a result of a decrease in flow rate from 0. 5 to 0. 1 pore volume (PV) d- 1. Addition of ZVI to OC reduced the inhibition of ClO 4 - removal by NO 3 - (NO 3 -N > 2 mg L- 1), but sulfate did not inhibit ClO 4 - removal in any <b>treatment</b> <b>column.</b> Environmentally relevant EC contamination is frequently derived from WWTP discharge. Two-year water sampling was conducted to identify potential tracers to track wastewater downstream from two WWTPs over a 31 km stretch of the Grand River in southwestern Ontario, Canada. The results indicate that elevated concentrations of Cl-, NH 3 -N, NO 2 -, and ECs including the artificial sweetener acesulfame-K (ACE-K), and pharmaceuticals carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine (CAF), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), ibuprofen (IBU), gemfibrozil (GEM), and naproxen (NAP) were observed near the two WWTPs, and their concentrations decreased over distance downstream. A Spearman Rank correlation analysis shows strong correlation among ACE-K, CBZ, GEM, NAP, and Cl-, suggesting the potential use of these contaminants as co-tracers to track wastewater in the study area. However, Cl- was less reliable due to other sources of contamination such as road salt applications in winter. Laboratory batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the ultraviolet light (UV) photocatalytic treatment of artificial sweetener ACE-K and pharmaceuticals CBZ, CAF, SMX, 3, 4 -methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3, 4 -methylenedioxymetham- phetamine (MDMA), IBU, GEM, and NAP using two types of catalyst, magnetically separable TiO 2 (MST) recoverable nanoparticles (γ-Fe 2 O 3 @SiO 2 @TiO 2 colloidal nanospheres) and graphene oxide supported TiO 2 (GO TiO 2) recoverable nanoparticles (GO/TiO 2 /CSA nanocomposites) compared to commercial P 25 TiO 2. The synthesized GO TiO 2 exhibited comparable or greater photocatalytic ability compared to P 25 TiO 2 in terms of intrinsic reaction rate constants for removal of ACE-K (> 99 % removed from 10 μg L- 1) and eight pharmaceuticals (> 92 % removed from 1 μg L- 1) from water. Photocatalytic ability of MST nanoparticles was lower compared to GO and P 25 TiO 2 nanoparticles. The non-recoverable P 25 nanoparticles have been reported to have adverse impact on human health and ecological systems when released to the environment after use. The GO TiO 2 nanoparticles could potentially be used as a substitute for P 25 nanoparticles in water treatment due to its competitive photocatalytic ability and high magnetic recovery. Laboratory column experiments were conducted to evaluate the removal of pharmaceuticals, artificial sweeteners, and perfluoroalkyl substances using ZVI, biochar (BC), and a mixture of (ZVI + BC). The results show that input pharmaceuticals CBZ, CAF, SMX, MDA, MDMA, IBU, GEM, and NAP at ~ 9 µg L- 1 were almost completely removed (> 97 %) in Columns ZVI, BC, and (ZVI + BC). About 80 ̶ 99 % of input artificial sweetener sucralose (SCL) (~ 110 µg L- 1) was removed in three treatment columns. However, artificial sweeteners ACE-K and saccharin (SAC) were partially removed; cyclamate (CYC) was not removed in any column. About 60 ̶ 99 % of input perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (24. 0 ̶ 89. 6 µg L- 1) was removed in Columns BC and (ZVI + BC); less of input PFOS was removed in Column ZVI compared to the columns containing BC. Partial removal of input perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (~ 45 µg L- 1) was observed in Columns BC and (ZVI + BC), but less in Column ZVI. The removal rates of target contaminants within three treatment columns were not enhanced after column flow rates were decreased from 0. 3 to 0. 1 PV d- 1, except for ACE-K. Laboratory batch experiments were conducted to investigate the removal mechanisms of PFOA and PFOS by ZVI and a mixture of (ZVI + BC). The results show ~ 20 % and ~ 60 % of input PFOA (~ 20, 000 µg L- 1) were removed by ZVI and (ZVI + BC); ~ 90 % and ~ 94 % of input PFOS (~ 20, 000 µg L- 1) were removed by ZVI and (ZVI + BC). However, only ~ 17 % of input short chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid (PFCA) perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA, C 7 -PFCA) (26 µg L- 1) was removed by ZVI alone and (ZVI + BC); the input PFCA perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA, C 6 -PFCA) (0. 8 µg L- 1) was not removed by ZVI and (ZVI + BC). Similarly, the input short chain perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) including 330 µg L- 1 of perfluoroheptane sulfonic acid (PFHpS, C 7 -PFSA), 13 µg L- 1 of perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS, C 6 -PFSA), and 6 µg L- 1 perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS, C 4 -PFSA) were less effectively removed by ZVI and (ZVI + BC) compared to PFOS. About 57 ̶ 70 % of input PFHpS, 30 ̶ 40 % of input PFHxS, and 20 % of input PFBS were removed by ZVI alone and (ZVI + BC). The removal efficiency of short chain PFCAs and PFSAs by ZVI and (ZVI + BC) decreased with a decrease in chain length. Sorption and reductive defluorination likely contributed to the removal of PFOA and PFOS by ZVI and (ZVI + BC). Fluoride (F-) is the indicative by-product of defluorination of PFOA and PFOS; increasing concentrations of F- were observed in the supernatants of (PFOA + ZVI) and (PFOS + ZVI) samples. The defluorination efficiencies of PFOA and PFOS were back-calculated based on the observed F- concentrations. About 10 % of input PFOA and 5 % of input PFOS (~ 20, 000 µg L- 1) were partially defluorinated (2 F defluorinated from 15 F of PFOA and 17 F of PFOS) by ZVI alone, but not by the mixture of (ZVI + BC). The defluorination efficiency of PFOA and PFOS by (ZVI + BC) were likely underestimated due to sorption of F- by the reactive media. This study demonstrates that ZVI, wood chips, and biochar are promising and cost-effective reactive media which can potentially be used in permeable reactive barriers or flow-through reactors for effective removal (> 97 %) of perchlorate and pharmaceuticals (CBZ, CAF, SMX, MDA, MDMA, IBU, GEM, and NAP); for moderate removal of artificial sweeteners ACE-K and SCL and perfluoroalkyl substance PFOS; for some removal of artificial sweetener SAC and perfluoroalkyl substance PFOA; and for no removal of artificial sweetener CYC from contaminated water under ambient environmental conditions...|$|E

In <b>treatment</b> <b>columns</b> RDX-contaminated water was amended with acetate as readily available carbon source, and in control columns no electron donor was used. The results of the temperature study demonstrated clear indications of adverse effects of lower aquifer temperature on biological activity of RDX-degraders.

This treatability study examined the use of four amendments (acetate, ethanol, soluble starch, and acetate plus ammonium), which served as electron donors. Triplicate columns, with groundwater residence time of about 27. 5 h, were used for each amendment treatment and the amendment control. In <b>treatment</b> <b>columns</b> amendment dosing was 500 mg/L C for carbon sources and 100 mg/L N for ammonium. Each of the amendment treatments reduced RDX inlet concentrations of 100 µg/L to less than 1 µg/L. The highest first-order RDX biodegradation rate ranged between 0. 140 and 0. 447 h− 1 for acetate amended columns as compared to 0. 037 to 0. 083 h− 1 in control columns (no amendment). The addition of soluble starch resulted in increased toxicity (based on Microtox® analysis) that was partially removed by biological activity in the columns. Ethanol addition itself {{did not result in}} increased toxicity but biological activity in this system did induce Microtox® toxicity. Acetate did not have any Microtox® toxicity associated with it. The addition of ammonium as a nitrogen source did not significantly increase the removal rate of RDX. Based on these observations acetate was selected for the field demonstration...|$|R
40|$|Interception by plant {{residues}} {{is a major}} process affecting pesticide persistence and leaching in conservation agriculture. Dissipation and leaching of S-metolachlor and glyphosate was studied in repacked soil columns covered with a mulch of maize and lablab residues. The columns were submitted to two contrasting simulated rainfall regimes: one with light but frequent rain (LF) and one with less frequent but more intense rain (HI). In both <b>treatments,</b> <b>columns</b> received {{the same amount of}} rainwater {{by the end of the}} experiment. Decomposing crop residues on the soil surface retained more than 50 % of the applied amount of pesticide. S-metolachlor dissipation in mulch residues was faster under the LF rainfall regime. This was attributed to more humid surface conditions, under which mulch decomposition was also faster. The formation of metabolites of both molecules was higher under the LF rainfall regime. However, leaching of S-metolachlor and its metabolites to deeper soil layers was greater under the HI rainfall regime, whereas they accumulated in the surface layer under the LF rainfall regime. Glyphosate remained in the surface soil layer because of its strong adsorption capacity, whereas aminomethylphosphonic acid leached down in small amounts without any difference between the two rainfall regimes. The impact of mulch residues on herbicide dissipation was strongly dependent on molecule type and rainfall regime...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Two sets of {{laboratory}} experiments {{were carried out}} to investigate he role of clay liners on the retention of metals present in landfill leachate. In the first experiment leachate was passed through clay filled columns and comparisons made of the metal content in treat-ment columns (leachate) with that in the control columns (de-ionized water). The metals Na, K, Mg, Ca, A 1 and Fe show elevated concentrations {{when compared with the}} control columns. In addition, a black sludge was observed on the upper surface of the <b>treatment</b> <b>columns.</b> On analysis this sludge was found to be Fe-rich when compared with the surrounding leachate/clay matrix. In the second experiment a simple tank system was used to investigate sludge formation at the leachate: clay liner interface. The observed sludge was found to have elevated metal concentrations, with a corresponding decrease in metal evels in leachate samples, compared with analysis before the experiment. From these observations it was concluded that he sludge may be acting as a sink for key metal contaminants from leachate. The attenuation of landfill leachate by mineral liners is a concept in which the landfill industry has placed considerable confidence. This is reinforced by the small number of pollution incidents in the UK arising from the disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW), by virtue of appropriate geological and design consideration...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} interest in enhancing natural attenuation of munitions-contaminated soils. Present study reports the effect of increasing soil organic matter content on fate and mobility of trinitrotoluene (TNT) and metabolites in soil columns. This study was performed using 30 -cm-long columns containing a top 5 cm of contaminated soil as a source layer and an uncontaminated soil (25 cm) adjusted to 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 3. 0 % organic carbon (OC) content using compost. Contaminated soil layer was fortified with uniformly ring-labeled C- 14 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) or 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene (DNT); in total there were 8 <b>treatments.</b> <b>Columns</b> were leached with synthetic rain water under unsaturated flow conditions in downside up direction. There was {{significant increase in the}} retention of both C- 14 -TNT and C- 14 -DNT in soils with increasing soil OC content and in 3. 0 % soil OC content column < 1 % TNT/DNT was recovered in the leachate. Further, degradation of TNT and metabolites from contaminated soil was significantly increased and resulted in greater soil-bound residues. Formation of monoamino-dinitrotoluene (ADNTs), diamino-mononitrotoluene (DANTs) and monoamino-mononitrotoluene (ANTs) metabolites was greatly enhanced with increase in OC content of soils. Study suggests that increasing OC content of contaminated soil to 3. 0 % significantly enhanced the reduction of nitroaromatics to more polar amine metabolites and the formation of soil-bound residues...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the potential of using clay minerals abundant in local soils in Egypt as low cost materials to reduce Cu, Ni and Zn pollution of soil and groundwater originating from polluted wastewater; specifically focusing on the influence of the interaction of clay minerals and heavy metals with OM already present in the soil, or in the wastewater itself. To achieve this aim, the following specific objectives were formulated: • To identify and characterize the different clay mineral types in the context of their application in local wastewater treatment in Egypt. • To investigate the influence of the presence of DOM and the timing of its application (before or concurrently with the HMs) on the mobility of Cu, Ni and Zn in clay-rich deposits using a static batch approach. • To unravel the effect of the timing of the addition of DOM on the competitive adsorption of Cu, Ni and Zn onto different sorbent compositions in a kinetic system using a dynamic column approach. • To investigate the role of the presence and timing of addition of DOM during loading of clay mineral-based wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>columns</b> on the subsequent removal of the HMs from the columns, focusing both on regenerating clay minerals used in wastewater treatment, and (re) mobilization of HMs previously immobilized in clay rich soils...|$|R

Nakamura and Kondo (2002 a, b, 2009) and Kondo and Nakamura (2004) developed waste input–output model that was extended to the conventional input–output model by including waste generation sectors in the rows and waste treatment sectors in the columns. Since the number of waste generation sectors (rows) is larger than waste <b>treatment</b> sectors (<b>columns)</b> in the waste industry input–output table, a suitable method was proposed and implemented to obtain a squared input coefficient matrix for calculating the Leontief inverse matrix.|$|R

The upper 10 cm of 60 -cm-long acid silt loam soil (pH 4. 6) and strip mine spoil (pH 4. 1) columns was treated with enough FBCW to raise the pH of the two media to 5. 0 and 6. 0, and 4. 6 and 6. 0, respectively. Loadings of Ca, S, and Mg in the upper 10 cm of the pH 6 mine spoil treated were 1, 132, 309, and 46 μg/g soil, respectively. Approximately twice these loadings were applied to the upper 10 cm of the acid soil columns. Heavy metal loading rates were very low in all <b>treatments.</b> <b>Columns</b> were leached with 10 cm of water at 10 -day intervals 7 and 14 times. Percolate samples collected from mine spoil columns treated with FBCW showed no evidence of enhanced levels of Al, B, Ca, Cd, Cr, F-, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, SO 42 -, Sr, and Zn after 14 leachings. Acid soil columns, containing higher levels of organic matter, had percolate concentrations of Ca, Mg, Mn, and SO 42 - that increased with increasing FBCW liming applications. None of the analyzed constituents showed any evidence of downward migration in mine spoil matrix and only Ca moved downward into the 10 - to 15 -cm depth of the soil matrix...|$|R
