5|$|After World War II, the {{military}} continued <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> {{in the local}} economy, but post-Cold War cutbacks took a heavy toll on the local defense and aerospace industries. The resulting downturn led San Diego leaders to seek to diversify the city's economy by focusing on research and science, as well as tourism.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{abundance}} in certain areas, the Caribbean reef shark {{is one of}} the least-studied large requiem sharks. They are believed <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> in shaping Caribbean reef communities. These sharks are more active at night, with no evidence of seasonal changes in activity or migration. Juveniles tend to remain in a localized area throughout the year, while adults range over a wider area.|$|E
5|$|Chotiner was slated <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> in the Eisenhower/Nixon {{re-election}} bid. However, he had represented two Atlantic City clothing manufacturers, the Kravitz brothers, who {{had been}} fined and barred from further government contracts for fraud, and on April 25, 1956, a subcommittee of the Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations, looking into military procurement, subpoenaed him to appear before it. The senators wanted to inquire why a New Jersey firm which already had six attorneys would hire a California lawyer, especially one {{with close ties to}} Vice President Nixon.|$|E

5|$|Pepper saw {{much success}} in playing for Bethlehem; after unimpressive beginnings, {{he went on}} <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> in {{securing}} many titles for the side, including four American Cups, three National Challenge Cups and two National Association Football League triumphs. Becoming captain for the 1918 and 1919 campaigns, success continued until his abrupt departure in 1920. Pepper's career became somewhat volatile, signing for four amateur teams within the space of four years; all of which failed to match his record at Bethlehem. Retirement saw him remain prominent in local sporting and steel-working culture in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, in-time becoming a corn merchant {{until his death in}} 1950.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter was <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> {{during the}} Indo-Pakistani War of 1965; {{along with the}} Gnat the Hunter was India's primary air defence fighter, and {{regularly}} engaged in dogfights with the Pakistani F-86 Sabres and F-104 Starfighters. The aerial war saw both sides conducting thousands of sorties in a single month. Both sides claimed victory in the air war, Pakistan claimed to have destroyed 104 aircraft against its own losses of 19, while India claimed to have destroyed 73 enemy aircraft and lost 35 of its own. Despite the intense fighting, the conflict was effectively a stalemate.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of chemical defences in plants {{is linked to}} the emergence of chemical substances that are not involved in the essential photosynthetic and metabolic activities. These substances, secondary metabolites, are organic compounds that are not directly involved in the normal growth, development or reproduction of organisms, and often produced as by-products during the synthesis of primary metabolic products. Although these secondary metabolites have been thought <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> in defenses against herbivores, a meta-analysis of recent relevant studies has suggested that they have either a more minimal (when compared to other non-secondary metabolites, such as primary chemistry and physiology) or more complex involvement in defense.|$|E

5|$|H.D. {{was born}} into the Moravian {{community}} in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Her father, Charles Doolittle, was professor of astronomy at Lehigh University and her mother, Helen (Wolle), was a Moravian with {{a strong interest in}} music. H.D. was their only surviving daughter in a family of five sons. In 1896, Charles Doolittle was appointed Flower Professor of Astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania, and the family moved to a house in Upper Darby. She attended Philadelphia's Friends' Central High School, at Fifteenth and Race streets, graduating in 1905. In 1901, she met and befriended Ezra Pound, who was <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> both in her private life and her emergence as a writer. In 1905, Pound presented her with a sheaf of love poems under the collective title Hilda's Book.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{attempted}} {{to influence the}} outcomes of the elections in the Holy Roman Empire, which would appoint a new King of the Romans. When the more prominent German candidates failed to gain traction, Henry began to back his brother Richard's candidature, giving donations to his potential supporters in the Empire. Richard was elected in 1256 with expectations of possibly being crowned the Holy Roman Emperor, but continued <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> in English politics. His election faced a mixed response in England; Richard was believed to provide moderate, sensible counsel and his presence was missed by the English barons, but he also faced criticism, probably incorrectly, for funding his German campaign at England's expense. Although Henry now had increased support in the Empire for a potential alliance against Louis of France, the two kings were now moving towards potentially settling their disputes peacefully; for Henry, a peace treaty could allow him to focus on Sicily and his crusade.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81 {{could be}} bought by mail order {{in kit form}} or pre-assembled. In {{what was then a}} major innovation, it was the first cheap mass-market home {{computer}} that could be bought from high street stores, led by W. H. Smith and soon many other retailers. The ZX81 marked the first time that computing in Britain became an activity for the general public, rather than the preserve of businesspeople and electronics hobbyists. It inspired the creation of a huge community of enthusiasts, some of whom founded their own businesses producing software and hardware for the ZX81. Many went on <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> in the British computer industry in later years. The ZX81's commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain's leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company's founder, Sir Clive Sinclair.|$|E

5|$|On December 16, 1811, {{the first}} of the New Madrid {{earthquakes}} shook the South and the Midwest. Many Indians took the earthquake as a sign that Tenskwatawa's predictions of doom were coming true, and they supported Tecumseh in greater number, including many of his former detractors. They increased their attacks against European-American settlers and isolated outposts in the Indiana and Illinois Territories, resulting in the deaths of many civilians. The Shawnee partially rebuilt Prophetstown over the next year, but it was destroyed by a second US campaign in 1812. Tecumseh continued <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>role</b> in military operations on the frontier. By the time the U.S. declared war on Great Britain in the War of 1812, Tecumseh's confederacy was ready to launch its own war against the United States, this time with British allies. Tecumseh's warriors made up nearly half of the British forces that captured Detroit from the United States in the War of 1812. It was not until Tecumseh's death at the 1813 Battle of the Thames in Ontario that his confederacy ceased to threaten the interests of the United States.|$|E
