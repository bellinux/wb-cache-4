5|$|Although {{none were}} ever built, several {{derivatives}} of Black Arrow were also proposed, as ways of increasing its payload capacity. One proposal added eight Raven solid rocket motors from the Skylark programme {{to the first}} stage as booster rockets.

5|$|In 1965, the Museum Society raised $40,000 <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>the</b> grand portal {{of the old}} church. It was {{installed}} in the de Young Museum, the centerpiece of Hearst Court, the main exhibit hall. The rest of the stones were abandoned by the museum in May 1969 with the announcement {{that there would be}} no reconstruction. After this, stones were occasionally taken by park workers and used to decorate Golden Gate Park.|$|E

5|$|Morotai {{remained}} an important Allied base after Leyte was secured. Aircraft of the Thirteenth Air Force and Australian First Tactical Air Force (formerly No. 10 Operational Group RAAF) were based at Morotai and attacked {{targets in the}} NEI and southern Philippines {{until the end of}} the war. From April 1945, the island was also used by the Australian I Corps <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>the</b> Borneo Campaign. Australian Army engineers expanded the base facilities at Morotai to support this operation. Due to overcrowding, some Australian camp sites were located outside the American perimeter.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{mainland}} {{came under}} attack during 1942 and 1943. Japanese submarines operated off Australia from May to August 1942 and January to June 1943. These attacks sought to cut the Allied supply lines between Australia and the US and Australia and New Guinea, but were unsuccessful. On 14 May 1943 the hospital ship AHS Centaur was sunk by a Japanese submarine off Brisbane {{with the loss of}} 268 lives. Japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>the</b> North Western Area Campaign against Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI).|$|E

5|$|The great Renaissance {{projects}} of Brescia were {{interrupted by the}} war. Even the Loggia palazzo, where Cairano had already established scaffolds <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>the</b> figures on the second level, including two angular trophies, was not to see a resumption of work till fifty years later, {{under the direction of}} Ludovico Beretta. The town's priorities had changed from artistic pomp and cultural recovery to basic necessities and vital functions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of most of Australian New Guinea the RAAF and RAN participated in the US-led Western New Guinea campaign, which had the goal of {{securing}} bases to be used <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>the</b> liberation of the Philippines. Australian warships and the fighter, bomber and airfield construction squadrons of No.10Operational Group RAAF participated in the capture of Hollandia, Biak, Noemfoor and Morotai. After western New Guinea was secured No.10Operation Group was renamed the First Tactical Air Force (1TAF) and was used to protect the flank of the Allied advance by attacking Japanese positions in the NEI and performing other garrison tasks. The losses incurred whilst performing these relatively unimportant roles led {{to a decline in}} morale, and contributed to the 'Morotai Mutiny' in April 1945.|$|E
5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>the</b> female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing her head on his torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E

5|$|Locomotive tenders {{were also}} changed as new, {{improved}} designs became available. Some {{examples of the}} second batch (70025–70029) were equipped with the BR1A tender, which had a higher water capacity of 5,000 gallons. Members of the third batch (70045–70054) were equipped with another tender design, the BR1D, which had 9 tons of coal and 4,750 gallons of water, {{due to the fact}} that they were intended for use on longer runs in the north of the railway network. This tender design also featured a steam-powered coal pusher, which eliminated the need for crew members <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>the</b> tender to pull forward coal when the locomotive was at a stop.|$|E
5|$|The 40th Infantry Division Slavonska was {{battered}} by German artillery fire {{during the night}} 9/10 April. Seriously depleted by desertion and weakened by revolt, it was unable <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>the</b> ordered counterattack against the Barcs bridgehead {{on the morning of}} 10 April. The 42nd Infantry Regiment could only muster 600 men, and the 86th Infantry Regiment slightly more. The divisional cavalry squadron was also heavily reduced in strength, and divisional artillery amounted to one anti-aircraft battery. The border units, responsible for demolition tasks on the line from Bjelovar south to Čazma, refused to follow orders. Having abandoned the counterattack, Raketić decided to establish a defensive line at Pćelić to hinder German movement east towards Slatina.|$|E
5|$|The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company did {{not allow}} any other {{professional}} company to present the Savoy operas in Britain until the copyrights expired {{at the end of}} 1961, although it licensed many amateur and school societies to do so, beginning in the 19th century. After 1961, other professional companies mounted productions of the opera in Britain. These have included Tyrone Guthrie's 1960 production from Stratford, Ontario, seen on Broadway in 1960 and in London in 1962 and a New Sadler's Wells Opera Company production first seen on 4 June 1984 at Sadler's Wells Theatre, which was seen also in New York. Scottish Opera, Welsh National Opera and many of the other British opera companies have mounted productions, as did the reconstituted D'Oyly Carte Opera Company between 1990 and its closure in 2003. In recent years, the Carl Rosa Opera Company has produced Pinafore several times, including in 2009, and Opera della Luna and other British companies continue <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>the</b> piece.|$|E

5|$|The Enterprise was {{refurbished}} for its space shots, {{with its}} shiny exterior dulled down and extra detail {{added to the}} frame. Compared to the newly built Reliant, the Enterprise was hated by the effects artists and cameramen; it took eight people <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>the</b> model, and a forklift truck to move it. The Reliant, meanwhile, was lighter and had less complex internal wiring. The ships were filmed on a blue screen with special film that does not register the color; the resulting shots could be added to effects shots or other footage. Any reflection of blue on the ship's hull would appear as a hole on the film; the gaps had to be patched frame by frame for the final film. The same camera used to film Star Wars, the Dykstraflex, was used for shots of the Enterprise and other ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{work was}} {{translated}} back to French by Felix Coveliers for a {{production at the}} Fantaisies-Parisiennes in Brussels, which opened on 28 December 1878, despite concerns from Scribe's widow. However, in Paris, she refused permission for the Gaîté <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>the</b> work in that form, and {{the directors of the}} Théâtre des Nouveautés, Boulevard des Italiens therefore procured a much altered libretto from Alfred Delacour and Victor Wilder, and in this form the Paris première was produced at that theatre on 15 March 1879, with costumes by Grévin, running for 59 nights. Revived in April 1882, the production received 55 more performances, with Marguerite Ugalde in the title role.|$|E
5|$|Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan {{had ordered}} Burnside to make Roanoke Island his first target. Capture {{of the island}} would allow control of both Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds, opening up a {{possible}} southern invasion route to Richmond. Coordinating with a naval flotilla commanded by Admiral Louis M. Goldsborough, Burnside launched an amphibious assault (one {{of the first of}} the Civil War) resulting in the Battle of Roanoke Island on February 7 and 8, 1862. After landing, the 21st spent a cold, wet night on picket duty. On February 8, it joined in the assault on the Confederate fort {{at the center of the}} island. Moving through swamps and knee-deep water, Reno's brigade, including the 21st, advanced around the Union left flank on the west side of the fort. After firing steadily on the fort for some time and taking moderate casualties, the 21st was ordered by Brig. Gen. Reno to storm the fort. According to the regimental historian, the 21st Massachusetts was the first regiment <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>the</b> earthworks of the fort; however, the honor was also claimed by the 9th New York. The Union forces were victorious in capturing the Confederate fort on Roanoke Island and took approximately 2,500 Confederate soldiers prisoner. The 21st suffered 13 killed and 44 wounded, or eight percent casualties, during the engagement.|$|E

5|$|The {{community}} that constructed the trackway were Neolithic farmers who had colonised {{the area around}} 3900 BC, and {{the evidence suggests that}} they were, by the time of construction, well organised and settled. Before this human incursion, the uplands surrounding the levels were heavily wooded, but local inhabitants began to clear these forests about this time to make way for an economy that was predominately pastoral with small amounts of cultivation. During the winter, the flooded areas of the levels would have provided this fishing, hunting, foraging and farming community with abundant fish and wildfowl; in the summer, the drier areas provided rich, open grassland for grazing cattle and sheep, reeds, wood, and timber for construction, and abundant wild animals, birds, fruit, and seeds. The need to reach the islands in the bog was sufficiently pressing for them <b>to</b> <b>mount</b> <b>the</b> enormous communal activity required for the task of stockpiling the timber and building the trackway, presumably when the waters were at their lowest after a dry period. The work required for the construction of the track demonstrates that they had advanced woodworking skills and suggests some differentiation of occupation among the workers. They also appear to have been managing the surrounding woodland for at least 120 years.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} flight of Zveno-1, using a Tupolev TB-1 mothership and two Tupolev I-4 fighters mounted {{on top of}} the wings, took place on 3 December 1931. An error in the sequence of opening the latches by the bomber crew resulted in one of the fighters prematurely separating, but the TB-1 with an I-4 attached to one of the wings remained in controlled flight and the second fighter was soon uneventfully deployed. After latch control was fully moved into the fighters, the normal launch procedure consisted of pilots opening the tail lock and then pulling on the control stick to open the front locks and separate from the bomber. As predicted, the presence of docked fighters had a minimal impact on performance of the mothership, and Zveno-2 Tupolev TB-3 carrying three Polikarpov I-5 fighters handled the same as an ordinary bomber. <b>To</b> <b>mount</b> <b>the</b> aircraft on the wings, they were pushed up special ramps but the centerline aircraft had to be lifted {{on top of the}} fuselage by hand. This was so cumbersome that the centerline I-5 became a permanent fixture on top of the Zveno-2 TB-3 and never started in the air. At one point, the centerline I-5, still with a pilot at the controls to operate the engine, had the wings and the tail surfaces removed and was used purely as fifth powerplant for the bomber mothership.|$|E
