40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays examining the effects of high-skilled immigration on various economic outcomes within the receiving country. In the first essay, I study how skilled immigrants affect wages and employment in US industries during 1995 - 2007, using novel microdata on approved H- 1 B visas. These data show that most H- 1 B employers specialize {{in the production of}} high-skilled services used as inputs by other businesses. In light of this, I consider the downstream effects of skilled immigrants on industry labor market outcomes: how wages and employment in an industry respond to immigration shocks to its suppliers. The identification strategy relies on large policy changes to the annual limit on H- 1 B admissions. I find that higher admissions lead to higher mean wages in exposed downstream industries. Also rising with downstream exposure are the wages of high-skilled, STEM, and low-skilled workers, and the employment of high-skilled and STEM workers. These findings indicate that higher admissions increase average wages by increasing worker compensation but also by changing the composition of employment in exposed industries. While immigration status is not observable in my data, my estimates suggest that higher admissions benefit US native workers because exposed downstream sectors hire few immigrants. ^ In the second essay, I use the administrative data mentioned above to examine how skilled immigrants affect the employment prospects of young skilled natives in US states during 2000 - 2009. My identification strategy uses a decline in the supply of visas to a state caused by (1) changes in national immigration policy, and (2) tougher competition in the market for visas as demand by the largest H- 1 B employer increased dramatically. I show robust evidence that increased hiring of skilled foreign workers lowers employment of young college-educated natives. Consistent with previous work, I find no effect on total college-educated employment. ^ In the last chapter, I consider how rising skilled immigration during 1995 - 2007 affected service offshoring in US industries. Using the H- 1 B microdata, I document a large increase in the employment of skilled immigrants in <b>tradeable</b> <b>service</b> sectors during 1995 - 2007. Because skilled immigration may be endogenous to offshoring, I develop instruments that use variation in H- 1 B inflows that depend on (1) the annual limit on H- 1 B admissions set by government policy and (2) US macroeconomic conditions. These national shocks have differential effects across industries because some industries are always more exposed to skilled immigration than others. I find that higher skilled immigrant flows lead to higher offshoring in highly exposed industries. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Internet of Services {{promotes}} distributable, composable and <b>tradeable</b> <b>services</b> as first-class entities. Such {{services are}} assumed to en-compass the full range from electronic web services to conventional business services. However, {{research and development of}} service models and platforms to realise the Internet of Services vision has largely been concentrating on pure technical services. In this case study, we have applied modelling and registration techniques to existing business services with none or few techni-cal components. We outline the results of suitability and acceptance aspects and include an evaluation of the new Unified Service Description Language (USDL) compared to the Web Services Modelling Language (WSML) in the context of real-world service representation. ...|$|R
40|$|Internet-based {{technologies}} are strategically guiding the organisation of <b>tradeable</b> <b>services</b> {{through the development}} of flexible organisational structures at national and international level. Specifically for knowledge intensive business services, tasks can be mediated via technology rather than by direct physical engagement, providing enterprises with the opportunity for extensive market coverage. Many academic and political ideals thus assume that entrepreneurs have the ability to intuitively recognise technologically innovative opportunities and have the confidence to act on them. The main aim of the paper is to present the findings of a recent empirical study of Irish (Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland) knowledge-intensive service sector firms and shed some light on recent thinking in relation to ‘e’ entrepreneurial micro and macro-level influences. The micro-level findings reveal a relatively high level of ‘e’ entrepreneurial orientation and motivation. However, from a macro-level perspective, the overall conclusion is that firms in both regions of Ireland could benefit from a system that cultivates a more inclusive, networked and balanced regional innovation system, to foster technology-innovation led enterprise.

40|$|Abstract – New {{research}} {{advances in}} loosely-coupled, uniformly described service-oriented systems continue {{to appear at}} a high rate. Application areas such as enterprise information systems, cloud computing and programmable web applications benefit from these developments. Yet, {{it is hard for}} researchers, developers and students to understand the combined effect of methodologies, which leads to unutilised opportunities to further accelerate the innovation. We present our proposed solution called SPACEflight. It is a free, ready-to-use demonstrator which contains a complete service platform, service engineering tools, extensions for cloud computing and service quality ensurance, and on top a user-friendly service-oriented desktop with <b>tradeable</b> scenario <b>services.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|I {{study the}} effects of service {{offshoring}} on white-collar employment, using highly disaggregated occupational data for the U. S [...] I present a structural model of the firm’s behavior that allows tractable derivation of labor demand elasticities for highly detailed occupations. I estimate the model using Quasi-Maximum Likelihood, to simultaneously account for the high degree of censoring of the employment variable and the small cross-sectional dimension of the panel. I find that service offshoring is skill-biased, because it raises employment among high-skilled occupations and lowers employment among medium- and low-skilled ones. Within each skill group, <b>service</b> offshoring penalizes <b>tradeable</b> occupations and tends to benefit complex non <b>tradeable</b> jobs. <b>service</b> offshoring, white-collar occupations, labor demand elasticities, homothetic weak separability, censored demand system estimation...|$|R
40|$|The {{empirical}} {{evidence shows that}} there exists a negative relationship between the ratio of employment to population and the standard deviation of (log of) GDP. In this paper, we build a Real Business Cycle model with an underground economy sector in order to quantitatively address this issue. The existence of an alternative to registered market activities for providing <b>tradeable</b> goods and <b>services</b> implies that population will be switching sectors in response to aggregate productivity shocks, amplifying the response of registered output. The level of participation in registered market activities will then be negatively related to fluctuations. This feature does not arise in a standard on...|$|R
40|$|The {{last one}} and a half centuries have {{witnessed}} dramatic changes in the world economy. The service (tertiary) sector, which {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century was of little importance relative to agriculture and manufacturing, has become the dominant sector today, accounting for 80 % and more of value added in advanced countries and around 70 % and of employment. Innovations in transport technologies and in information and communications technologies have radically reduced the costs of trading goods and have also made an increasing share of <b>services</b> <b>tradeable.</b> We propose a tractable micro-founded Ricardo-Marshall model to study the implications of the rise of the service sector and its interaction with international trade and factor mobility for the location of economic activity. Our model highlights a tension between nontradeable services which exert an agglomerative force and trade costs and comparative advantage which act as dispersion forces...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of China and India as significant influences {{in the world}} economy and in world markets for <b>tradeable</b> goods and <b>services,</b> commodities, labour and financial assets is, arguably, the most significant change in global macro-economics since at least the breakdown of the Bretton Woods currency system in the early 1970 s. From the standpoint of the global economy, it is at least as important as Japan’s sustained and rapid growth in the decades following the end of the Second World War, which saw Japan emerge as the world’s second largest economy in 1966, a position which it held until 1992. Over the past decade, China’s economy has expanded at an average annual rate of 8. 4 %, a pace exceeded by only six other countries in the IMF’s universe of 180 countries 1; while India‘s economy has grown at an annual average rate of 6. 0 %. Over the same period, OECD economies have grown by an annual average of 2. 7 %. These growth rates are rapid by historical standards, but are by no means unprecedented for economies at China’s and India’s stage of economic development. For example Japan’s economy grew at an average annual rate of 8. 8 % in the 1950 s and 10. 5 % in the 1960 s; West Germany grew by 8. 2 % per annum in the 1950 s; South Korea at annual rates of 8. 7 %, 9. 6 % and 9. 1 % in the 1960 s, 70 s and 80 s, respectively; Taiwan at annual rates of 8. 5 %, 10. 0 % and 9. 2 % in the 1950 s, 60 s and 70 s, respectively; and Singapore at annual rates of 9. 2 %, 9. 0 %, 7. 1 % and 7. 7 % in the decades from the 1950 s through th...|$|R
40|$|Globalisation {{has been}} {{associated}} with increased international mobility of capital but less so of labour partly because of legal restrictions. In theory, labour mobility and trade are generally substitutes in respect of <b>tradeable</b> goods and <b>services.</b> There are, however, also instances of complementarity between migration and trade. The promotion of free trade and the regulation of migration suggest that trade rather than migration is the preferred instrument to promote economic growth. Empirical evidence suggests that not only political but also economic forces tend to promote international trade rather than migration in the current period of globalisation. In the course of the 1990 s, labour mobility in western Europe lagged behind the growth in international trade of goods and services as industries employing a high proportion of migrants in the production of tradeable goods declined. Technological developments, the reduction in transport costs as well as catching up processes in the productive capacities of less developed trading partners, e. g., Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs), resulted in a change in the composition of production of tradeable goods. However, the composition of migrant labour by industry and skills changed little, and labour mobility lost momentum. Thus, the transfer of production of goods and services to less developed countries, {{in the case of the}} EU, CEECs, contributed to the loss of momentum in demand pull migration. Recent developments especially in communications technology, tended to promote mobility of services rather than labour mobility. As long as capital, technology and managerial skills are mobile, labour may remain in the country of origin, e. g., the case of Indian computer programmers. Physical labour mobility remains necessary only where services are linked directly to the consumers, for example, nursing or tourist services, or where a particular type of labour is linked to direct capital investment, for example, highly skilled labour which moves with multinational companies [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In the past, housing {{policy-makers}} {{have argued}} that housing is a social, rather than an economic, investment. However, problems with the housing market may be constraining national growth and imposing costs on the public purse (e. g. homelessness impacts on health budgets). Published research suggests a range of potential links between housing and economic growth. For example: 	High house prices might distort the economy toward construction investment and away from more productive industries in <b>tradeable</b> products or <b>services.</b> 	Housing tenures like home ownership might reduce workers’ willingness to move to jobs. 	Housing density might promote agglomeration economies and thus labour productivity. 	Housing close to jobs might reduce time in commuting and increase time for work. 	Housing market processes can segregate lower income people into certain areas reinforcing areas of low productivity. 	Low residential construction productivity might curtail overall productivity. 	Housing might affect health and childrens’ learning which influence human capital formation and long run productivity. However, {{there is a lack}} of systematic empirical evidence in Australia testing these relationships. Where research on productivity has been done, housing variables have often not been included. The study identified a range of databases and statistical techniques that could be used to explore this area further, and also argued for greater focus on studies at the local and metropolitan levels. Practitioners at a local level in Victoria and Western Australia were found to be only weakly connecting housing and economic development. Housing affordability, rising land values and house prices displacing economic activity were often cited as issues. Some policy-makers have responded by using housing and planning levers to promote growth, such as through mixed land use activity centres or programs encouraging home-based economic activities. Even so, many economic development practitioners see housing outside their portfolio, and many strategies are unclear on the broader spatial and economic consequences of housing decisions...|$|R
