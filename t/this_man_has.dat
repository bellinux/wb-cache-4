5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one risesâ€”he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E
500|$|In 1937, {{a justice}} of the New York State Supreme Court freed a {{prisoner}} who {{had been arrested for}} parole violation and beaten by Broderick, saying that [...] "the police of the City of New York beat him so badly that he will be a cripple for life. I think <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> more than expiated his crime." [...] The prisoner sustained fractures to the knee and ribs, his jaw was dislocated, and he was not given medical attention while in police custody. Broderick's superiors found no reason to discipline the detective.|$|E
500|$|Despite his {{scholarly}} {{achievements and}} the global importance of his work, Achebe never received a Nobel Prize, which some observers viewed as unjust. When Wole Soyinka was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Literature, Achebe joined the rest of Nigeria in celebrating the first African ever to win the prize. He lauded Soyinka's [...] "stupendous display of energy and vitality", {{and said he was}} [...] "most eminently deserving of any prize". In 1988 Achebe was asked by a reporter for Quality Weekly how he felt about never winning a Nobel Prize; he replied: [...] "My position is that the Nobel Prize is important. But it is a European prize. It's not an African prize... Literature is not a heavyweight championship. Nigerians may think, you know, <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> been knocked out. It's nothing to do with that." ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Deringham {{bowed her}} head. <b>This</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> {{a right to}} ask her more than such slight favours.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> aroused it. I now saw the sinfulness {{of taking}} another passenger's {{place in a}} railway-carriage.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, CNN {{featured}} Tucker {{in a story}} titled Does <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>have</b> {{the most}} dangerous job in America?.|$|R
500|$|Dilling visited Germany in 1931 and, {{when she}} {{returned}} in 1938, noted a [...] "great improvement of conditions". [...] She attended Nazi Party meetings, and the German government paid her expenses. She wrote that [...] "The German people under Hitler are contented and happy.... don't believe the stories you hear that <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> not done a great good for this country." [...] In 1938, she toured Palestine, where she filmed what she described as Jewish immigrants ruining the country. While touring Spain, then embroiled in the Spanish Civil War, she filmed [...] "Red torture chambers" [...] and burnt-out churches, [...] "ruined by the Reds with the same satanic Jewish glee shown in Russia." [...] She visited Japan, which she viewed as the only Christian nation in Asia, and in 1939, she returned to visit Spain, for a second time.|$|E
2500|$|Secretary of State John Kerry said Snowden had [...] "damaged {{his country}} very significantly" [...] and [...] "hurt {{operational}} security" [...] by telling terrorists how to evade detection. [...] "The bottom line," [...] Kerry added, [...] "is <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> betrayed his country, sitting in Russia {{where he has}} taken refuge. You know, he should man up {{and come back to}} the United States." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the message of The Green Room, Truffaut said [...] "I am for the woman and against the man. As this century {{approaches}} its end, people are becoming more stupid and suicidal, and we must fight against this. The Green Room is not a fable, not a psychological picture. The moral is: One must deal with the living! <b>This</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> neglected life. Here we have {{a breakdown of the}} idea of survival." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> no more faith than a paynim, but, {{none the}} less, was a stout carl in war.|$|R
60|$|He {{understood}} that <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> come with serious purpose, and knew full well {{it might be}} dangerous for him to hang back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, from that, Harry," [...] Mrs. Holl said, [...] "if what <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>have</b> {{been and}} told Evan is right, {{you must be}} some {{relation}} to Captain Bayley." ...|$|R
2500|$|Dyer's casting was criticised by {{domestic}} violence charities because, in 2010, {{he was quoted}} in Zoo, {{for which he was}} an agony uncle, as advising someone to [...] "cut your ex's face, and then no-one will want her." [...] One volunteer said, [...] "This man's arrival will horrify many female fans", while family campaigner Dr Adrian Rogers said, [...] "This sends out completely the wrong message to viewers. Domestic violence is a major problem and the cause of pain and misery for many families. <b>This</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> spouted questionable opinions and gets rewarded." [...] Dyer apologised at the time and took responsibility for saying [...] "something stupid", and an EastEnders spokesperson responded to the criticism by saying, [...] "Danny has stated many times that the comments previously published are not his views." ...|$|E
60|$|Lady.--Well, I am {{satisfied}} <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> {{been ill}} {{used in the}} world.|$|E
60|$|MRS. ARBUTHNOT. What <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> been, he is now, {{and will}} be always.|$|E
6000|$|... "My business," [...] said Wildrake, as firmly as he could--for {{the close}} {{investigation}} of <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> given him some unpleasant nervous sensations--"my business is with your General." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. BARTHWICK. <b>This</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> dreadful eyes. He {{looked as}} if he could commit a murder. [...] "I 've 'ad nothing to eat to-day," [...] he said. Just like that.|$|R
60|$|His reveries {{had made}} Andrew quick-witted, {{and he had}} the {{judicial}} mind which prevents one's judging another rashly. Besides, his hankering after <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> already suggested an exculpation for him.|$|R
60|$|LADY DEDMOND. But, George, I'm afraid <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> {{brought it}} to a point--put ideas into her head.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's an {{engagement}} ring. We {{are going in}} here and see what sort of rings <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> got. It looks like a reliable place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I daresay {{you have}} not done it wittingly; but <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> guessed, and he could never have guessed it from look or word of mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|But as Hodder glanced {{from the}} {{derelict}} beside him {{a wave of}} comprehension passed through him that swept him clean of indignation, of resentment. And <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> been prosperous and happy! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> {{entered the}} {{pavilion}} oddly. He {{had seemed to}} dodge in and hesitate. Then he had chosen his table rather deliberately--and he kept looking, {{and trying not to}} seem to look.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> only watched at the seal-hole {{a couple}} of hours, but the natives {{frequently}} sit behind their snow walls for {{the greater part of}} a day, almost without moving hand or foot.|$|R
6000|$|PERCIVAL. Mr Tarleton: we {{have already}} said either too much or not enough. Lord Summerhays: will you be kind enough to witness the {{declaration}} <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> just signed? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> {{never said}} no more about me than he did that first time?' Sally asked. 'Why should he go on paying for me all this time?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I to {{understand}} that <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> professed himself to be altogether indifferent to the bishop's prohibition?" [...] said Mrs. Proudie, interrupting her husband and addressing Mr. Thumble.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure you {{can prove}} what you say?" [...] queried Belding, in the same cool, unemotional tone. It struck him strangely at the moment what little {{knowledge}} <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> of the West and of Western character.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> {{spent one}} season at St. John's, seven years before; {{but on his}} return home {{had gone back to}} the {{ordinary}} island life, until at last the good seed was beginning to take root.|$|R
60|$|Emma von der Tann's eyes {{showed her}} incredulity; then, act by act, she {{recalled}} all that <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> {{said and done}} since they had escaped from Blentz that had been so unlike the king she knew.|$|R
6000|$|PERCIVAL [in a very gentlemanly manner] Will {{you allow}} me to remind you, Mrs Tarleton, that <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> uttered a most serious and disgraceful {{falsehood}} concerning Miss Tarleton and myself? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You lie, woman, {{or if you}} do not lie, {{you know}} nothing. <b>This</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> the secret of Montezuma's treasure, and is worth a king's ransom,' and he lifted his club.|$|E
6000|$|... "And when is {{this trial}} to come off?" [...] put in Mrs. Canby. [...] "Really I don't see what good {{it will do}} me if <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> lost the money." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{father was}} walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. [...] "Lizzy," [...] said he, [...] "what are you doing? Are {{you out of}} your senses, to be {{accepting}} <b>this</b> <b>man?</b> <b>Have</b> not you always hated him?" ...|$|R
60|$|So {{determined}} {{was he to}} {{do nothing}} which should seem like trade-antagonism to the Mayor that he refused his first customer--a large farmer of good repute--because Henchard and <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> dealt together within the preceding three months.|$|R
6000|$|Anna {{leaned back}} in the chair and laughed softly. Even <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> {{accepted}} her for [...] "Alcide" [...] without a moment's question. Then all the embarrassments of the matter flashed in upon her. She was suddenly grave.|$|R
