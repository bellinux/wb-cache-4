5|$|The Wiyot {{tribe of}} California say that <b>the</b> <b>condor</b> recreated mankind after Above Old Man wiped {{humanity}} {{out with a}} flood. However, other tribes, such as California's Mono, viewed <b>the</b> <b>condor</b> as a destroyer, not a creator. They say that Condor seized humans, cut off their heads, and drained their blood {{so that it would}} flood Ground Squirrel's home. Condor then seized Ground Squirrel after he fled, but Ground Squirrel managed to cut off Condor's head when Condor paused to take a drink of the blood. According to the Yokut tribe, <b>the</b> <b>condor</b> sometimes ate the moon, causing the lunar cycle, and his wings caused eclipses. The Chumash tribe of Southern California believed that <b>the</b> <b>condor</b> was once a white bird, but it turned black when it flew too close to a fire.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the season}} progressed, {{attendance}} dropped below 1,000 fans per game, fueling speculation <b>the</b> <b>Condors</b> would fold before Christmas.

In the meantime, they began relocating home games, first to other cities in Pennsylvania, and then to farther-away places. On March 24, 1972 <b>the</b> <b>Condors</b> hosted <b>the</b> Kentucky Colonels in Birmingham, Alabama; four days later, <b>the</b> <b>Condors</b> hosted <b>the</b> Colonels again, this time in their last ever 'home' game, in Tucson, Arizona.|$|R

5|$|In Peru, {{they are}} {{occasionally}} shot, {{but more often}} revered and used for ceremonial purposes. The Yawar Fiesta is a celebration, the pinnacle {{of which is the}} tying of an Andean condor to the back of a bull, allowing <b>the</b> <b>condor</b> to kill the bull with its talons before being released. This ceremony is a symbolic representation {{of the power of the}} Andean peoples (<b>the</b> <b>condor)</b> over the Spanish (the bull). There is also a ceremony known as the arranque del condor in which a live Andean condor is suspended from a frame and is punched to death by horsemen as they ride by.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>condor</b> {{on top of}} {{the shield}} {{stretches}} his wings to symbolize power, greatness and strength of Ecuador. <b>The</b> <b>condor</b> also represents the idea that it will always be ready to attack any enemy. The shield is flanked by four national flags. The laurel on the left represents the victories of the republic. The palm leaf on the right side is a symbol of the martyrs of the fight for independence and liberty. The Fasces below the shield represents the republican dignity. The final design of the coat of arms was completed in 1900.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>condor's</b> {{population}} {{continued to}} decline, discussion began about starting a captive breeding {{program for the}} birds. Opponents to this plan argued that <b>the</b> <b>condors</b> had <b>the</b> right to freedom, that capturing all of <b>the</b> <b>condors</b> would change <b>the</b> species' habits forever, and that the cost was too great. However, the project received {{the approval of the}} United States government, and the capture of <b>the</b> remaining wild <b>condors</b> was completed on Easter Sunday 1987, when AC-9, <b>the</b> last wild <b>condor,</b> was captured. At that point, there were only 22 condors in existence, all in captivity.|$|R

Shiren eventually reaches the land, where he frees the golden condor from an ancient insect-like creature. He and Koppa ride away on <b>the</b> <b>condor,</b> flying across the towns he had passed, and the townspeople look up at <b>the</b> <b>condor</b> and make a wish. <b>The</b> <b>condor</b> lands, letting Shiren and Koppa jump off, before flying away.

5|$|German air crews {{supported}} the Nationalist advance on Madrid and {{the relief of}} the Siege of the Alcázar. <b>The</b> <b>Condor</b> Legion's aircraft were accompanied by two armoured units. By the end of 1936, 7,000 Germans were in Spain. The Nationalists were supported by German units and equipment during the Battle of Madrid and during the Battle of Jarama of February 1937. The fighting demonstrated the inadequacy of the Legion's aircraft compared to superior Soviet-made fighters. The War in the North {{was supported by a}} constantly re-equipping Condor Legion. In Operation Rügen, waves of planes bombed and strafed targets in Guernica leaving 1,685 people dead and over 900 injured. The offensive on Bilbao was supported by ground units and extensive air operations. It proved the worth of the Legion to the Nationalist cause. The Legion also took part in the Battle of Brunete and both land and air forces were involved in the Battle of Teruel. Up to 100 sorties a day were launched during the Nationalists' counter-offensive. The continued Nationalist offensive on Aragon in April–June 1937, including the Battle of Belchite, involved bombing raids {{and the use of the}} Legion's ground forces. On 24–25 July, Republican forces launched the Battle of the Ebro. Reconnaissance units of <b>the</b> <b>Condor</b> Legion warned Nationalists forces, but this went unheeded. 422 sorties by the Legion's aircraft had considerable effect.
