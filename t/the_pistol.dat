5|$|To promote {{comfortable}} and accurate shooting from {{a standing position}} match air pistols must have fast lock times, shoot practically recoilless and vibration free and exhibit minimal movement and balance shifts during discharge. <b>The</b> <b>pistol</b> must {{also be able to}} be tailored by adjustable user interfaces and various accessories to individual shooters personal preferences. Combined with appropriate match pellets <b>the</b> <b>pistol</b> has to produce a consistent 10 ring performance, so a non maximal result during the initial phase {{can be attributed to the}} participant.|$|E
5|$|Descendants of Wyatt Earp's cousins {{assert that}} Earp carried <b>the</b> <b>pistol</b> {{featured}} in the auction and while in Tombstone, although the grips, barrel, and cylinder have been replaced. Only the frame is original, and its serial number has been filed off. However, X-ray testing showed an original serial number, 5686, which matches a batch of revolvers purchased by the U.S. Army in 1874.|$|E
5|$|It is each shooter's {{responsibility}} to get <b>the</b> <b>pistol</b> and shoes validated {{in a specific}} area, the equipment control, prior to starting the competition. Clothing is only inspected during the actual competition. To discourage shooters from lowering the trigger pull weight after passing the equipment control, random controls are conducted after the match with failure resulting in immediate disqualification.|$|E

5|$|There {{are some}} {{restrictions}} on <b>the</b> <b>pistol,</b> {{and it must}} be operated by one hand only from a standing, unsupported position. The shooter decides his or her own tempo as long as the maximum time is not exceeded, but in the final round for the top shooters, separate commands are given for each shot so that the audience may follow the progress of the standings.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} ISSF pistol events, special {{supportive}} clothing and shoes are not permitted. Optical aids are allowed {{as long as}} they are not mounted on <b>the</b> <b>pistol,</b> which may only have open sights. Ear protection is recommended by the ISSF as well as by coaches, who sometimes stress their usefulness in shutting out distracting noise rather than their necessity for safety reasons (paramount in other shooting disciplines).|$|E

50|$|Both the VP9 and VP40 use Heckler & Koch's {{ergonomic}} handgun grip {{design that}} includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels that allow <b>the</b> <b>pistol's</b> to fit {{any and all}} hand sizes. Molded finger grooves {{in the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>pistol's</b> grip also instinctively position the shooters hand for optimal shooting.|$|R

5000|$|At an unreported date, Ruperti {{bought two}} {{gold-plated}} Napoleonic-era pistols which were {{once owned by}} Simón Bolívar, the Venezuelan-born Latin American 19th Century independence hero, at an auction in New York, for $1.6m. It was later reported {{that he planned to}} donate <b>the</b> <b>pistols</b> to <b>the</b> Venezuelan government, but Ruperti denied this in his Wall Street Journal interview, saying he would leave them to his children. However, Venezuelan President, Hugo Chávez Frías confirmed that he received <b>the</b> <b>pistols</b> in national TV on July 2011. In said video, President Chávez states clearly that Ruperti [...] "donated" [...] <b>the</b> <b>pistols.</b>|$|R
5|$|Billy Clanton {{was shot}} in the wrist, chest and abdomen, and after a minute or two slumped to a sitting {{position}} near his original position {{at the corner of the}} MacDonald house in the lot between the house and Fly's Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with <b>the</b> <b>pistol</b> supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{officials}} charged Loughner {{the next}} day with killing federal government employees, attempting to assassinate a member of Congress and attempting to kill federal employees. Police reports reveal he had purchased a Glock pistol at a Sportsman's Warehouse store, after passing the required FBI background check, less than six weeks before and attempted to buy additional ammunition for <b>the</b> <b>pistol</b> at a Walmart {{on the morning of the}} shooting, but the clerk refused to sell it to him based on his appearance and demeanor.|$|E
5|$|Later in the game, {{the player}} acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. <b>The</b> <b>pistol</b> has three capabilities: a {{standard}} fire mode, {{the ability to}} create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls.

Though Demeke kept <b>the</b> <b>pistol</b> pointed at Goebel's head {{for the duration of}} the flight, he removed his ski mask. Goebel later told newspapers that he spent the hours trying to build a rapport with Demeke, who admitted to having spent several months planning the hijacking. Both men agreed that, upon arriving in New York, Goebel would give Demeke his sunglasses in exchange for Demeke's pistol.|$|E
5|$|Rathbone {{jumped from}} his seat and {{struggled}} with Booth, who dropped <b>the</b> <b>pistol</b> and drew a knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth prepared to jump from the box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box, and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought {{he was part of}} the play.|$|E
5|$|Virgil Earp was {{not expecting}} a fight. Once Behan said that he'd {{disarmed}} the Cowboys, Virgil traded the short, double-barreled shotgun {{he was carrying}} for Holliday's cane. Virgil carried the cane {{in his right hand}} and shifted <b>the</b> <b>pistol</b> in his waistband from the right side to his left. Holliday concealed the short shotgun under his long jacket. Wyatt too was not expecting a fight and put his pistol in his overcoat pocket.|$|E

Brocius waived a preliminary hearing so he and his case could be transferred to Tucson District Court. Virgil and Wyatt escorted Brocius to Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from a lynching. White, age 31, died of his wound two days after his shooting.|$|E
5|$|After the shooting, Saldívar {{entered her}} red 1994 GMC pickup truck {{and tried to}} leave the motel parking lot. Motel {{employee}} Rosario Garza saw Saldívar leave her room with a wrapped towel. It was later {{thought she was going}} to Q-Productions to shoot Quintanilla, Jr. and others who were waiting for Selena. However, she was spotted by a responding police officer in a vehicle. The officer left his vehicle, drew his gun, and ordered Saldívar out of the truck. Saldívar did not comply; she backed up and parked adjacent to two cars. Her truck was then blocked in by the police vehicle. Saldívar picked up <b>the</b> <b>pistol,</b> pointed it at her right temple, and threatened to commit suicide. A SWAT team and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit were brought in. Musicologist Himilce Novas later said the event was reminiscent of O.J. Simpson's planned suicide 10 months earlier.|$|E
5|$|Demeke {{demanded that}} the {{aircraft}} be flown to New York City and demanded political asylum in the United States. After being told that the plane {{would need to be}} refueled, Demeke agreed to allow a refueling stop in Hannover, Germany. The aircraft landed at Hannover-Langenhagen Airport around noon local time, where it was surrounded by law enforcement officials. Demeke remained in the cockpit with <b>the</b> <b>pistol</b> to the pilot's head, and threatened to begin killing a flight attendant every five minutes. German authorities allowed the plane to depart after Demeke threatened to kill his hostages but promised to surrender peacefully upon reaching the United States.|$|E

5|$|On 9 February, {{the evening}} before the attacks, back in Sơn Dương, a large {{contingent}} of rebels made their final preparations before heading into battle. They met at three points; the homes of Bang and the local Confucian scholar, and in the fields. They then joined together for a final meeting before Nhu divided the combined forces in two groups. Nhu led one towards a barracks in Hưng Hóa, while the other would attack the town facilities in the district capital of Lâm Thao. Some members of the rebels wore khaki uniforms and they departed for their objective after midnight. Nhu was armed with <b>the</b> <b>pistol,</b> while the others were each given a scimitar and two bombs. The groups traversed rivers on boats and arrived outside their attack points, where they were to synchronised their assaults by sending a light signal.|$|E
5|$|One unique feature {{found on}} most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns was an aluminum, steel, or {{bakelite}} resting bar or support under the barrel. This {{was used to}} steady the weapon when firing {{over the side of}} open-top armored personnel carriers such as the Sdkfz 251 half-track. A handguard, made of a synthetic material derived from bakelite, was located between the magazine housing and <b>the</b> <b>pistol</b> grip. The barrel lacked any form of insulation, which often resulted in burns on the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned. The MP 40 also had a forward-folding metal stock, the first for a submachine gun, resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded. However, this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use.|$|E
5|$|The {{day before}} Jamila's execution, Ibrahim meets with Susi, who tells him about Jamila's romantic {{involvement}} with Nurdin. Jamila became pregnant with Nurdin's child {{and insisted that}} he take responsibility, but instead Nurdin {{told her he was}} marrying someone else and humiliated her in public. When the two met in a hotel, Nurdin threatened Jamila with a pistol; in self-defence, Jamila killed him with <b>the</b> <b>pistol.</b> In the modern day, Jamila walks towards her execution; the president has not responded to the request for stay. The screen fades to black as a gunshot goes off, and afterwards, statistics about child trafficking and prostitution are shown.|$|E
