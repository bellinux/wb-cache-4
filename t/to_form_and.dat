5|$|A Different Kind of Truth was {{recorded}} at Henson Recording Studios and Eddie Van Halen's own 5150 Studios and produced by John Shanks. Seven of the album's thirteen songs are musically re-worked and lyrically re-written songs {{that had been}} demoed in the late-1970s/early 1980s, but never officially released. The album received positive reviews upon release, with several writers referring {{to it as a}} return <b>to</b> <b>form,</b> <b>and</b> multiple publications ranked it {{as one of the best}} albums of 2012. It was also a commercial success, debuting in the top ten on numerous record charts. It debuted at No.2 on the Billboard 200 and, by the end of 2012, had sold in excess of 411,000 copies in the United States alone. The album was promoted with an arena tour.|$|E

5|$|By August18, the NHC {{noted that}} the {{hurricane}} was asymmetrical, having uneven distribution of the wind radii. Later that day, deep convection continued <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>and</b> an eye later appeared on satellite imagery. Early the next day, the eye became increasingly defined {{as the center of}} Bob passed roughly 35mi (55km) from the North Carolina coastline. By 0600UTC, Hurricane Hunters recorded flight level winds of 140mph (225km/h), corresponding to surface winds of 115mph (185km/h). At this time, the barometric pressure of the storm also decreased to 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg), the lowest pressure recorded during the storm. After attaining this intensity, the hurricane tracked quickly northeast at 25mph (35km/h), steered by the trough over the southeast United States, an upper-level cutoff low over the Great Lakes Region and the subtropical ridge over the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the romantic}} period, typified by Sylves (1927) and Volumes (1928), Rabearivelo's poems are shorter and reflect a purer form of {{traditional}} models.

5|$|Wolf 359 {{is one of}} {{the faintest}} and lowest-mass stars known. At the {{light-emitting}} layer called the photosphere, it has a temperature of about 2,800 K, which is low enough for chemical compounds <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>and</b> survive. The absorption lines of compounds such as water and titanium(II) oxide have been observed in the spectrum. The surface has a magnetic field that is stronger than the average magnetic field on the Sun. As a result of magnetic activity caused by convection, Wolf 359 is a flare star that can undergo sudden increases in luminosity for several minutes. These flares emit strong bursts of X-ray and gamma ray radiation that have been observed by space telescopes. Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years. No companions or disks of debris have been detected in orbit around it.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{philosophers}} of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis {{has been accused of}} either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT, this leaves him open to the question of why the LOT itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>and</b> confirm hypotheses so that the LOT itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (the LOT) in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for the LOT itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT, then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the LOT would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that the LOT is unique in that it {{does not have to be}} learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.|$|E
5|$|In the lower, broader {{part of the}} estuary near Avonmouth, {{the tidal}} surge {{advances}} as a slight roll in the deepwater channels and the water rapidly spreads across the sands and mudbanks. Past Sharpness, the bore begins <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>and</b> when it encounters the large left-handed bend at Hock Cliff, it crashes headlong into the rocks. Reforming, it runs up-river close to the Overton shore before crossing the estuary towards Box Cliff. As it rounds the Horseshoe Bend it keeps to the outside but it afterwards moves across to {{the eastern side of}} the river. Above Langney Sands, the river abruptly narrows to a hundred yards, the sands diminish and the channel occupies the whole of the river. Now the bore is recognisably the spectacular phenomenon that people expect rather than a swelling flood of water. From Minsterworth to Gloucester, the width of the river varies little and the bore continues unhindered, climbing the banks on the outer side of bends and breaking over shallow places. At Lower Parting, close to Gloucester, it splits in two to pass either side of Alney Island. Both branches encounter and overcome weirs and rejoin at Upper Parting, and the much diminished bore continues upstream. In particularly high tides the water may overtop the weir at Tewkesbury, and even the foot of the weir at Worcester may experience a rise in water level of a foot or so.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{results were}} {{surprising}} as the material excavated {{by the impact}} contained more dust and less ice than had been expected. The only models of cometary structure astronomers could positively rule out were the very porous ones which had comets as loose aggregates of material. In addition, the material was finer than expected; scientists compared it to talcum powder rather than sand. Other materials found while studying the impact included clays, carbonates, sodium, and crystalline silicates which were found by studying the spectroscopy of the impact. Clays and carbonates usually require liquid water <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>and</b> sodium is rare in space. Observations also revealed that the comet was about 75% empty space, and one astronomer compared the outer layers of the comet to the same makeup of a snow bank. Astronomers have expressed interest in more missions to different comets {{to determine if they}} share similar compositions or if there are different materials found deeper within comets that were produced {{at the time of the}} Solar System's formation.|$|E
5|$|Reeves' {{impact was}} immediate. As Parcells {{had done in}} 1984, Reeves named Simms his {{starting}} quarterback. The defense returned <b>to</b> <b>form,</b> <b>and</b> allowed more than 20 points once all season. With two regular season games left, the Giants were 11–3 and appeared poised for a first-round playoff bye. They were upset by a Phoenix Cardinals team, {{who came into the}} game with just five wins, 17–6, in the next-to-last week of the season, setting up a winner–take–all contest against Dallas in the final regular season game. Though the Giants played well, it was Emmitt Smith's memorable performance with a separated shoulder that led the Cowboys to a 16–13 overtime win, giving the Cowboys a sweep of the season series and home-field advantage throughout the NFC Playoffs. Despite the loss, the Giants made the playoffs as a Wild Card and won their first-round game, 17–10 over the Vikings. However, they were defeated by the San Francisco 49ers 44–3 in the divisional playoffs. Simms played in all 16 games, completing nearly 62% of his passes, and threw for over 3,000 yards and 15 touchdowns. Simms, Hampton, offensive linemen Jumbo Elliot and center Bart Oates made the Pro Bowl, and Reeves was named Coach of the Year by the Associated Press. After the season, Lawrence Taylor and Phil Simms, the two biggest figures of the late 1980s and early 1990s Giants teams, retired.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{tropical}} cyclogenesis on 5December, {{the surrounding}} atmospheric conditions were generally favorable for continued development, however, a northeasterly wind flow generated wind shear, somewhat inhibiting development and partially exposing Sam's low level center of circulation as it tracked westward. Over {{the following two}} days, however, the tropical cyclone's rainbands were able to fully enclose the center of circulation. During the evening hours of 6December, however, Sam began to interact with a shortwave trough, causing the cyclone to curve southward and towards the northwestern coast of Australia. Over the following day, an eye started <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>and</b> Sam began to rapidly intensify. At 0400UTC, the storm attained Category3 cyclone intensity on the Bureau of Meteorology cyclone scale. Ten hours later, Category4 intensity was achieved. At the time, Sam had featured an eye measuring 30mi (40km) in diameter. Objective Dvorak intensity analysis gave the system a rating of 7.7, corresponding to an estimated intensity of 215km/h (135mph). Around the same time, Sam briefly became stationary before resuming its southward trek. Continuing to intensify, TCWC Perth upgraded the cyclone to Category5 intensity at 2000UTC, with winds of 195km/h (120mph) and a minimum pressure of 950hPa (mbar; 28.06inHg). However, in post-storm analysis, it was analyzed that Sam had had in fact peaked with winds of 205km/h (125mph) and a minimum pressure of 935 hPa (mbar; 27.61 inHg). The JTWC rated the storm as a Category3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. At the same intensity, Sam made landfall near Lagrange, Western Australia at 1300UTC on 8December. Upon moving ashore, Sam began to slowly weaken over the Great Sandy Desert. On 9December, the JTWC ceased the monitoring of the system, as the weakened Sam began to curve eastward. After {{a brief period of}} restrengthening over central Australia on 13December, Sam finally weakened below tropical cyclone intensity the following day before dissipating shortly thereafter.|$|E
