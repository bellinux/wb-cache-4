5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> of the river, the Millennium Bridge {{was opened}} in 2001. There {{was once a}} ferry at this point, before 1865, which gave access to the Victoria Dock, opened in 1850. South Bridge {{replaced}} the ferry in 1865, {{making it easier for}} workers to reach the dock. The swing footbridge was closed in 1934, but was not demolished until 1944.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} great size, supertankers often cannot enter port fully loaded. These ships {{can take on}} their cargo at {{off-shore}} platforms and single-point moorings. On <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> of the journey, they often pump their cargo off to smaller tankers at designated lightering points off-coast. A supertanker's routes are generally long, requiring it to stay at sea for extended periods, up to and beyond seventy days at a time.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after lunch, Lindwall made a {{confident}} appeal for leg before wicket (lbw) against Washbrook, {{but was not}} supported behind the stumps by a silent Saggers, and the umpire ruled against the tourists. At <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> Hutton square drove Toshack for four, bringing up his fifty in 125 minutes. He followed this with another boundary in the same direction, and Washbrook back cut Lindwall for four more at <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end.</b> This brought up England's 100, its first without loss for the series. Washbrook then on-drove a ball to the boundary and brought up his half-century, as Bradman pondered how to capture Australia's first wicket. England brought up 150 without loss 30 minutes before tea, and continued unhindered by two brief rain interruptions. Up to this point, the Australian bowling had been loose and inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|Launched in 1987 {{priced at}} £350, Artemiz is the {{flagship}} tonearm whose design {{was also a}} break from established conventions. The arm and headshell is a one-piece construction; the large-gauge aluminium tube interference-fitted at one end into a massive yoke that is the bearing. The tube is flat at <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> to provide for mounting the cartridge. The arm is finished in a matt resonant paint. Unusually, there is no finger lift for cueing but the arm is fitted with a conventional lever-operated lift/lower assembly.|$|E
5|$|Mark Livolsi realized, as McKenna had on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> {{that the}} film worked best when it focused on the Andrea-Miranda storyline. Accordingly, he cut a number of {{primarily}} transitional scenes, such as Andrea's job interview and the Runway staff's trip to Holt's studio. He also took out a scene early on where Miranda complimented Andrea. Upon reviewing them for the DVD, Frankel admitted he hadn't even seen them before, since Livolsi didn't include them in any prints he sent to the director.|$|E

5|$|On {{the second}} day, Morris fell at 1/73 and Bradman {{came in to}} join Barnes. Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. He packed the leg side with fielders and ordered Alec Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman almost edged the second ball onto his stumps, before defending uneasily for a period. While Jim Laker stopped the scoring at <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> Bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes. The Australian captain regarded Bedser as the finest seam bowler he faced in his career, and he batted in a circumspect manner as he sought to establish himself. At <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end,</b> Bradman misjudged a ball from Laker and an incorrectly executed cut shot narrowly went wide of the slip fielder. Now aged 40, Bradman's reflexes had slowed and he no longer started his innings as confidently {{as he had done}} in the past.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{thatched}} {{houses in}} Little Thetford {{was destroyed by}} fire.

Fireworks were being discharged at <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> of the village. All that remained were burnt beams and smouldering walls, which were apparently made of old fen-mud. The villagers saved the nearby Three Horseshoes public house, by forming a bucket chain, and pouring water on its thatched roof.|$|E

5|$|That same year, J.J. Thomson {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} which he channeled a stream of neon ions through magnetic and electric fields, striking a photographic plate at <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end.</b> He observed two glowing patches on the plate, which suggested two different deflection trajectories. Thomson concluded this was {{because some of the}} neon ions had a different mass. The nature of this differing mass would later be explained by the discovery of neutrons in 1932.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{director}} to align along an external field {{is caused by the}} electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.|$|E

5|$|The fight {{began with}} a {{flagrant}} foul by Knicks guard Mardy Collins on Nuggets guard J. R. Smith in the closing seconds of the game.
