25|$|Billed as a {{blend of}} mystery, romance and the paranormal, The Murder Hole is a meaty book.... Not a frothy mystery to gulp down in one sitting, it’s a book to save for a lazy weekend or {{relaxing}} vacation when there’s time <b>to</b> <b>savor</b> {{the complexities of the}} story and take in the scent and sense of Scotland.|$|E
25|$|In its {{depiction}} of violence, Leone used his signature long drawn and close-up style of filming, {{which he did}} by mixing extreme face shots and sweeping long shots. By doing so, Leone managed to stage epic sequences punctuated by extreme eyes and face shots, or hands slowly reaching on a holstered gun. This builds up the tension and suspense by allowing the viewers <b>to</b> <b>savor</b> the performances and character reactions, create a feel of excitement, as well as giving Leone the freedom to film beautiful landscapes. Leone also incorporated music to heighten up the tension and pressure {{before and during the}} film's many gunfights.|$|E
25|$|Tamara is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} Balakirev's greatest work as well as a touchstone of orientalism. Originally he intended to write a lezginka modeled after Glinka. However, he was inspired by the poetry of Mikhail Lermontov about the seductress Tamara, who waylays travelers in her tower at the gorge of Daryal and allows them <b>to</b> <b>savor</b> a night of sensual delights before killing them and flinging their bodies into the River Terek. Balakirev evokes both the poem's setting of the mountains and gorges of the Caucasus and the angelic and demonically seductive power of the title character. The narrative employs a wide musical range, with the composer supplying great subtlety within a satisfying structure.|$|E

In the area is also the Museum of Culture Coffee, showing the process from grain production <b>to</b> <b>savoring</b> a traditional Colombian coffee. This museum, like all the other theme parks, are replicas of the colonial city, where tourists enjoy dance performances and traditional music, panoramic views from cable car with its lush landscape, and various rides.|$|R

25|$|By the mid-20th century, Peking Duck {{had become}} a {{national}} symbol of China, favored by tourists and diplomats alike. For example, Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, met Premier Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People on July 10, 1971, during his first (secret) visit to China. After a round of inconclusive talks in the morning, the delegation was served Peking Duck for lunch, which became Kissinger's favourite. The Americans and Chinese issued a joint statement the following day, inviting President Richard Nixon to visit China in 1972. Following Zhou's death in 1976, Kissinger paid another visit to Beijing <b>to</b> <b>savor</b> Peking Duck. Peking Duck, at the Quanjude in particular, {{has also been a}} favorite dish for various political leaders ranging from Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro to former German chancellor Helmut Kohl.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Eastwood {{revisited}} {{the western}} genre in his film Unforgiven, which he directed {{and in which}} he starred as an aging ex-gunfighter long past his prime. Scripts existed for the film as early as 1976 under titles such as The Cut-Whore Killings and The William Munny Killings but Eastwood delayed the project {{because he wanted to}} wait until he was old enough to play his character and <b>to</b> <b>savor</b> it as the last of his western films. Unforgiven was a major commercial and critical success; Jack Methews of the Los Angeles Times described it as [...] "the finest classical western to come along since perhaps John Ford's 1956 The Searchers. The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards, (including Best Actor for Eastwood and Best Original Screenplay for David Webb Peoples) and won four, including Best Picture and Best Director for Eastwood. In June2008 Unforgiven was ranked as the fourth-best American western, behind Shane, High Noon, and The Searchers, in the American Film Institute's [...] "AFI's 10 Top 10" [...] list.|$|E
500|$|Mayank Shekhar of Hindustan Times {{gave the}} film 3 out of 5 stars while remarking, [...] "This {{is the kind}} of genuine theatre experience, now getting rare, which remains most {{precious}} {{in the life of a}} film-goer. Reason can take over later. I had a ball!" [...] Sonia Chopra of Sify gave it 3 out of 5, and mentioned, [...] "Debut director Karan Malhotra shows great promise in making the film visually arresting and maintaining the consistency of performances. But remaking a cult film means you have big shoes to fill. If you’re a loyalist of the late Mukul Anand’s Agneepath, you’re likely to have reservations with this one. But if you leave the comparisons aside and are willing to forgive the faults, Agneepath is worth a watch essentially <b>to</b> <b>savor</b> Hrithik’s performance." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave Agneepath 3 out of 5 and said, [...] "It is in the end, an old-fashioned revenge drama treated in that melodramatic, over-the-top style. You're not likely to be bored by the intense action and the solid performances, but prepare to be exhausted by just how long this film plays on." ...|$|E

5000|$|Rasa theory {{blossoms}} {{beginning with}} the Sanskrit text Nātyashāstra (nātya meaning [...] "drama" [...] and shāstra meaning [...] "science of"), a work attributed to Bharata Muni where the Gods declare that drama is the 'Fifth Veda' because it is suitable for the degenerate age as the best form of religious instruction. The Nātyashāstra presents the aesthetic concepts of rasas and their associated bhāvas in Chapters Six and Seven respectively, which appear to be independent of the work as a whole. Eight rasas and associated bhāvas are named and their enjoyment is likened <b>to</b> <b>savoring</b> a meal: rasa is the enjoyment of flavors that arise from the proper preparation of ingredients {{and the quality of}} ingredients.|$|R
500|$|The review {{aggregator}} website Comic Book Roundup {{reported a}} 7.3 out of 10 average rating for the event, based on 270 critic reviews. Just before {{the release of}} the final part, Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated, [...] ""Trinity War" [...] itself seems almost wholly disinterested in the Trinity of Sin, the Seven Deadly Sins, {{or any of the other}} elements the crossover was initially predicated upon." [...] After Justice League #23 was released, Schedeen added,"Event comics often fail because they're more concerned with setting up a new status quo and changing the playing field than simply allowing readers <b>to</b> <b>savor</b> the high stakes and epic nature of the conflict at hand. [...] "Trinity War" [...] may well emerge as the new poster child for everything wrong with that approach. In the end, [...] "Trinity War" [...] becomes little more than a stepping stone towards Forever Evil. The result is that Justice League #23 is an almost wholly unfulfilling [...] "finale" [...] issue." [...] Overall, Newsarama's Richard Gray praised the storytelling, with the event [...] "cleverly weaving in threads set up two years ago in all related titles." [...] However, Gray was somewhat critical of the fact that [...] "the last panel of “Trinity War” leads directly into “Forever Evil”, effectively making this one big event that begets another. It’s a crime that both major syndicates are repeatedly guilty of these last few years, one so commonplace that it is increasingly difficult to take umbrage with a singular instance anymore." [...] Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza felt [...] "there are no true conclusions of any sort" [...] after the whole event, [...] "just more shock-for-shock's sake moments and lots of new questions" [...] added at the end of Justice League #23. As with Gray, Zawisza [...] "was hopeful DC's tactic of bleeding events one to the next would be over following the relaunch, but this issue proves – without an inkling of doubt – that that is simply not the case." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{raved about}} Carey {{performance}} following {{the completion of}} the ceremony, with Jon Pareles from The New York Times saying [...] "once she was worked up, she moaned, growled and swooped to the high and low extremes of her voice in [...] "Fly Like a Bird". A writer from USA Today complimented her recital of both songs, writing [...] "Carey certainly earned the right <b>to</b> <b>savor</b> the spotlight this year. But the diva made room for Walker's booming baritone in 'Bird', her fluttering homage to Minnie Ripperton." [...] Gary Susman from Entertainment Weekly called Carey the [...] "comeback queen" [...] and wrote [...] "Its what her voice did, soaring into the rafters like only Carey's can." [...] Roger Friedman from Fox News outed the performance as [...] "the number that sent the audience into a frenzy". On April9,2008, reality competition American Idol aired its second annual charity event, titled Idol Gives Back. Backed up by Randy Jackson on the bass, Carey appeared on stage as the last head-lining performer of the evening. Midway through the performance, a large church choir walked on stage in blue garbs, and provided the gospel climax for the song. Ann Powers from the Los Angeles Times called the song an [...] "inspirational show-stopper" [...] and felt Carey's vocal's were [...] "patented impossible notes". In regards to the performance, Katie Byrne from MTV News wrote [...] "Carey was at her over-the-top best, with a full gospel choir and the high notes that made her famous." [...] Aside from several televised performances, Carey included [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] on the set-lists of all her tours following its release. During Carey's The Adventures of Mimi Tour (2006) stop at Madison Square Garden, the song was dedicated to Ol' Dirty Bastard, who died in 2004 from an accidental drug overdose. The performance had to be re-done, as Carey's pastor, Clarence Keaton, missed his cue for the Biblical verses, and was forced to be found backstage and ushered to the spotlight. Four years later, Carey performed the song throughout her Angels Advocate Tour, only dedicating it to Keaton, who died on July3,2009. Editor and journalist Thomas Kintner from the Hartford Courant felt that during her live recital of [...] "Fly Like a Bird", Carey [...] "displayed power and sky-scraping pitch".|$|E
2500|$|It was the outsiders, artists, and journalists, who {{revealed}} and popularized {{this island}} {{to the world}} in the mid 19thcentury. Painters of the Hudson River School, including Thomas Cole and Frederic Church, glorified Mount Desert Island with their brushstrokes, inspiring patrons and friends to flock here. These were the [...] "rusticators". Undaunted by crude accommodations and simple food, they sought out local fishermen and farmers to put them up for a modest fee. Summer after summer, the rusticators returned to renew friendships with local islanders and, most of all, <b>to</b> <b>savor</b> the fresh salt air, beautiful scenery, and relaxed pace. Soon the villagers' cottages and fishermen's huts filled to overflowing, and by 1880, 30hotels competed for vacationers' dollars. Tourism was becoming the major industry.|$|E

[...] Alternative Press called the music on In Light [...] "enthralling," [...] summarizing that [...] "Givers have created a debut that will surely set them atop the indie-rock world, if not only for their strict adherence to trying everything possible and succeeding gloriously at it all." [...] Jon Young of Spin recommended that the record is [...] "best absorbed in small portions, allowing you <b>to</b> <b>savor</b> the seriously catchy melodies and uplifting vibes," [...] feeling that the songs blur together when consumed at once. Fraser McAlpine of the BBC Music parsed the record, describing it as [...] "an exhilarating first listen: you just don’t know what’s going to happen next." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bordwell {{has called}} the film opaque with {{characters}} {{that are difficult to}} interpret, unexplained conflicts, and major plot points that occur off-camera. Godard also sometimes frames characters to make them unrecognizable to the audience, films scenes with overlapping dialogue of characters on and off screen, and uses ellipses in scenes to create gaps in time. He also sometimes cuts to black frames, objects in the scene, or landscapes while dialogue from the scene is still heard. These techniques make the film both difficult to interpret and to comprehend. Bordwell believes [...] "we ought to find problems of comprehension fascinating. They remind us of storytelling conventions we take for granted, and they push toward other ways of spinning yarns, or unraveling them." [...] Bordwell believes that [...] "blocking or troubling our story-making process serves to re-weight the individual image and sound. When we can't easily tie what we see and hear to an ongoing plot, we're coaxed <b>to</b> <b>savor</b> each moment as a micro-event in itself, like a word in a poem or a patch of color in a painting." ...|$|E
