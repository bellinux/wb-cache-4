5|$|In {{the early}} years of the republic, Istanbul was {{overlooked}} in favor of Ankara, selected as Turkey's capital to distance the new, secular country from its Ottoman history. From the late 1940s and early 1950s, Istanbul underwent great structural change, as new public squares, boulevards, and avenues were constructed throughout the city, sometimes at the expense of historical buildings. The population of Istanbul began to rapidly increase in the 1970s, as people from Anatolia migrated to the city to find employment in the many new factories that were built on the outskirts of <b>the</b> <b>sprawling</b> metropolis. This sudden, sharp rise in the city's population caused a large demand for housing, and many previously outlying villages and forests became engulfed into the metropolitan area of Istanbul.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Wheatfield, NY429 heads across {{populated}} but less developed areas on its way to a junction with US62. North of this point, the closely spaced homes gradually give way to more isolated houses and, eventually, rural farmland. It continues on a north–south line to the town of Lewiston and the hamlet of Sanborn, located adjacent to the Lewiston–Cambria town line. In the small but developed community, NY429 follows Buffalo Street past three blocks of homes to a junction with NY31 (Saunders Settlement Road). Buffalo Street ends here; however, NY429 joins NY31 for two blocks east to Townline Road, a north–south highway delimiting the boundary between Lewiston and Cambria. NY429 continues north on Townline Road, passing <b>the</b> <b>sprawling</b> main campus of Niagara County Community College, a stark departure from the rural fields that NY429 traversed in Wheatfield.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{through the}} hands of four owners during its troubled 23-year history, Nittany Furnace never {{fulfilled}} the expectations developed when it replaced the antiquated (charcoal) Bellefonte Furnace. It should arguably never have been built: {{by the time it}} went into blast in 1888, the price per ton of iron had already been driven below $22, a historic low, and it would almost never rise above that figure until the onset of World War I. <b>The</b> <b>sprawling</b> steel works of Pittsburgh, fed by Mesabi Range ore, could produce iron more cheaply than the furnaces at Bellefonte ever could. The principal advantage of a Bellefonte location — proximity to local ore deposits — was negated by the availability of easily mined, high-grade Mesabi ore, hauled by rail.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>The</b> {{increasing}} urban <b>sprawl</b> in {{most cities}} {{in developing countries}} continues to attract attention of national and international agencies but the efforts had not achieved much result at checking <b>the</b> <b>sprawl.</b> There is <b>the</b> need therefore to re-evaluate these efforts and make necessary suggestions that would reverse the trend. This study investigates the problems of urban sprawl in Nigeria. It utilizes published and unpublished materials as well as sundry informal investigations (i. e. observations) of the stakeholders {{in the development and}} management of urban sprawl in Nigerian cities. The paper presents the urbanization trends in Nigeria and discusses the characteristic features of urban sprawl in its cities as well as identifies the various factors responsible for <b>the</b> urban <b>sprawl.</b> It evaluates strategies adopted so far at curtailing <b>the</b> <b>sprawl.</b> A major limitation of the various strategies adopted is the inadequate involvement of the people (developers) at checking <b>the</b> <b>sprawl.</b> <b>The</b> paper therefore suggests a people-oriented strategy in checking urban sprawl in Nigerian cities; which is expected to be facilitated by the government planning officials...|$|R
5|$|The Marathas marched {{beyond the}} Indus as their empire grew. The {{responsibility}} for managing <b>the</b> <b>sprawling</b> Maratha empire {{in the north}} was entrusted to two Maratha leaders, Shinde and Holkar, as the Peshwa was busy in the south. The two leaders did not act in concert, and their policies were influenced by personal interests and financial demands. They alienated other Hindu rulers such as the Rajputs, the Jats, and the Rohillas, and they failed to diplomatically win over other Muslim leaders. A large blow to the Marathas came in their defeat on 14 January 1761 at Panipat against the Afghan Ahmad Shah Abdali. An entire generation of Maratha leaders lay dead on the battlefield {{as a result of}} that conflict. However, between 1761 and 1773, the Marathas regained the lost ground in the north.|$|E
5|$|The high walk of crocodilians, {{with the}} belly {{and most of}} the tail being held off the ground, is unique among living reptiles. It {{somewhat}} resembles the walk of a mammal, with the same sequence of limb movements: left fore, right hind, right fore, left hind. The low walk is similar to the high walk, but without the body being raised, and is quite different from <b>the</b> <b>sprawling</b> walk of salamanders and lizards. The animal can change from one walk to the other instantaneously, but the high walk is the usual means of locomotion on land. The animal may push its body up and use this form immediately, or may take one or two strides of low walk before raising the body higher. Unlike most other land vertebrates, when crocodilians increase their pace of travel they increase the speed at which the lower half of each limb (rather than the whole leg) swings forward; by this means, stride length increases while stride duration decreases.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Commission's {{proposals}} were extensively debated. Hendrick van Kol, {{who was one}} of the leaders of the Social Democratic Workers' Party, argued that building up a strong fleet would hinder Dutch neutrality by making it impossible to avoid battle with foreign fleets which passed through NEI waters en route to other destinations. Other critics of the plan believed that it would be unwise for the Netherlands to join the naval arms race which was taking place in Europe at the time, and that competition between the major powers meant that none of them would allow another nation to occupy either the Netherlands or the NEI. The Dutch Army also opposed the development of a strong fleet in the NEI, arguing that a land force centered on Java would be better able to mount a prolonged resistance against a large invasion force and that reducing the size of the Army to fund the fleet would leave it unable to suppress insurrections. The Governor-General of the NEI, Alexander Willem Frederik Idenburg, argued that both a stronger Army and Navy were necessary, and advocated for seven battleships to be stationed in the Indies. He believed that the cost of this alternative could be managed by reducing the planned battleship force in European waters to three small ships. Other supporters of the proposal, led by the Onze Vloot ("Our Fleet") naval advocacy association, argued that it was necessary to build a strong fleet which was capable of defending the NEI as the loss of the colonial empire would greatly damage the Dutch economy and reduce the country's prestige. The Dutch Naval staff also debated the relative merits of torpedo boats and battleships, and concluded that while small craft and submarines were suitable for defending the Netherlands, large warships were needed to effectively protect <b>the</b> <b>sprawling</b> East Indies.|$|E

30|$|To {{understand}} the population movement better, we compute an Urban Sprawl index following Lopez and Hynes (2003) - SI[*]=[*](((S%[*]−[*]D%)/ 100)[*]+[*] 1))[*]×[*] 50. SI[*]=[*]sprawl index for metropolitan area; D%[*]=[*]percentage {{of the total}} population in high-density area; S%[*]=[*]percentage of total population in low-density area. The range of values for <b>the</b> <b>sprawl</b> index is from 0 to 100 as computed in a diffusion index formulation. If the value is at 100, it indicates highest level of <b>sprawl.</b> At 50, <b>the</b> distribution of the population is spread evenly. <b>The</b> <b>sprawl</b> index is used because it allows us to compute different levels of concentration and examine temporal and geographic changes and the effects of centralisation (Wassmer and Baass 2006). The main difference of <b>the</b> <b>sprawl</b> index from <b>the</b> population density is that it can assess how density is concentrated across areas. In this paper, our interest is to investigate how different types of urban pattern i.e. dense, centralized, decentralized and extremely decentralized could have an impact on land prices, which can be effectively revealed by <b>the</b> <b>sprawl</b> index.|$|R
40|$|Urban sprawl is {{frequently}} {{associated with the}} idea of an unsuitable development, leading to increasing economic, social and environmental problems. Moreover, its control is difficult because multiple patterns (concerning numerous traditional urban planning fields) overlap. In order to understand <b>the</b> <b>sprawl</b> process and to manage its consequences, it must be simplified. The construction of a decision making tool appears then interesting. The GIS-based tool presented here is being developed incollaboration between the urban planning agency of Belfort and the laboratory of geography of Strasbourg. It requires three steps: 1. quantification of <b>the</b> <b>sprawl</b> (how much areas are involved in theurban sprawl process?), 2. location of <b>the</b> <b>sprawl</b> (where are <b>the</b> areas defined in the first step?), 3. differentiation of <b>the</b> <b>sprawl</b> (what are <b>the</b> areas located in the second step?). Of course, the successionof the three stages makes the use of the complete model more complex. So, a global ergonomic user interface is being developed within the GIS, allowing to modify each parameter and to play easily numerous simulations...|$|R
