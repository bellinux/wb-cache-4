5|$|July 1, 2013: A {{series of}} three tornadoes <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> across the state; one in Fairfield County and two in Hartford County. Majority of impact limited to downed trees, though the EF1 caused notable {{structural}} damage near East Windsor.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of Apollo11 was to land safely {{rather than to}} <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> with precision on a particular spot. Three minutes into the lunar descent burn, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the Eagle would probably <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> beyond the planned landing zone by several miles. As the Eagles landing radar acquired the surface, several computer error alarms appeared. The first was a code 1202 alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin was aware of what this code meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that the alarms were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by an executive overflow in the lunar module computer. As described by Buzz Aldrin in the documentary In the Shadow of the Moon, the overflow condition was caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, so the computer had to process unnecessary radar data {{and did not have}} enough time to execute all tasks, dropping lower-priority ones. Aldrin stated that he did so with the {{objective of}} facilitating re-docking with the CM should an abort become necessary, not realizing that it would cause the overflow condition.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} broke many early-season tornado {{records for}} the state of Minnesota. The 14total tornadoes in the state were the most to ever <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> on a single day in March. The F4 tornado was the strongest ever recorded in the state in March, and its 67-mile (108km) path the longest tornado path ever recorded in Minnesota. In December 1998, the United States Department of Commerce awarded a bronze medal to the Twin Cities office of the National Weather Service (NWS) for providing excellent service to the public during the outbreak event.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, a small EF-1 tornado <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> {{south of}} US 411. In 2011, three tornadoes <b>touched</b> <b>down.</b> One, an EF-3 tornado, <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> in March 2011, and caused major damage and {{injuries}}, though no deaths. Two EF-0 tornadoes <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> during the April 27, 2011 Tornado Super Outbreak, though no major damage or injuries were reported. On February 29, 2012, an EF-0 tornado <b>touched</b> <b>down,</b> though no major damage or injuries were reported.|$|R
5|$|October 24, 1955: An F1 <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> {{in central}} Hartford County, while an F2 <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> near Waterbury.|$|R
50|$|At {{least seven}} tornadoes <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> across the Mississippi and Ohio Valley. The two strongest tornadoes were F3 tornadoes that <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> in Arkansas and Indiana. The most notable was a tornado that <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> near Moro, Arkansas, {{injuring}} 27 people and caused more than $500,000 (1970 USD) in damages. The other F3 tornado <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> in Tell City, Indiana, injuring two people and causing $50,000 (1970 USD) in damages.|$|R
5|$|McCulloch met former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr in 1993 {{and they}} wrote and {{recorded}} an album, tentatively titled <b>Touch</b> <b>Down.</b> The album {{was to be}} released in early 1994; however, despite McCulloch and Marr being happy with the album, Rob Dickins at WEA felt it was missing some element. Dickins suggested to McCulloch that Sergeant be brought in to do some work. McCulloch was initially sceptical because he had not spoken with Sergeant since de Freitas's funeral; however, he did give the idea some thought. Before McCulloch had chance to contact Sergeant, a mutual friend persuaded the pair to meet socially. While McCulloch and Sergeant were being reacquainted, the tapes from the McCulloch and Marr sessions disappeared. McCulloch was not upset about this as he and Sergeant had started working together as Electrafixion.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{during the}} month of March are an unusual {{occurrence}} in Minnesota when compared {{to the rest of the}} spring and summer months. Before this event there had been only six tornadoes ever recorded in the state during March, and since this event there has been only six. This outbreak also marks the first time in Minnesota history that two tornadoes were recorded on the same day in March, as well as the first time since 1921 that there have been multiple tornado fatalities on the same March day. Despite the historical significance of the outbreak, this was not the earliest calendar-year tornado to <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> in Minnesota; that record is held by three tornadoes that touched on March 6, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Crowds {{of people}} {{gathered}} in New York {{to witness the}} historic arrival, {{with tens of thousands}} of people crowding Battery Park in Manhattan to have a good view of the Statue of Liberty, where the aircraft was scheduled to <b>touch</b> <b>down.</b> Rumors circulated that L'Oiseau Blanc had been sighted along its route, in Newfoundland, or over Long Island. In France, some newspapers even reported that Nungesser and Coli had arrived safely in New York, evoking a wave of French patriotism. L'Oiseau Blanc had been carrying a sizable load of fuel, , which would have given them approximately 42 hours of flight time. After this time had passed, with no word as to the aircraft's fate, it was realized that the aircraft had been lost. In France, the public was scandalized by the newspapers such as La Presse which had printed false reports about the aircraft's arrival, and outrage was generated against the companies involved, with demonstrations in the streets.|$|E
5|$|June 30, 1998: Two F1 tornadoes briefly <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> in Killingworth and Lyme, and an F0 briefly <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> in Chester.|$|R

5|$|The 1904 Chappaqua tornado was {{an intense}} tornado that struck {{northern}} Westchester County, New York {{during the afternoon}} of July 16, 1904. As of 2009, this tornado ranks as the strongest tornado to <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> in the county, ranking as F3 on the modern-day Fujita Scale. The tornado formed around 3:30pm EST within a severe thunderstorm near Chappaqua, New York. The tornado quickly began to produce damage in the hamlet, destroying several structures and killing two people. Homes were knocked off their foundations and rolled over along the tornado's path. By 4:00pm EST, the tornado dissipated and left $100,000 (1904 USD; $2.4million 2009 USD) worth of damage in its wake. Hail associated with the same storm cell also inflicted damage upon a few structures. The tornado {{is known as the}} worst disaster in the history of Chappaqua.|$|E
5|$|Towers {{scored the}} first Welsh try, which was {{converted}} by Jim Webb. The Natives {{replied with a}} spirited run by Ellison, but he failed {{to break through the}} Welsh defence. The tourists trailed even further after George Thomas scored a breakaway try frrm the half-way line, which went some way to silence the heckles from the crowd. Webb, playing in out of position at full-back, missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark. The Natives continued to push, with Elliot coming within five-yards of the try line, and when Ellison did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25-yard line before he could <b>touch</b> <b>down.</b> In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander Bland dribbled the ball into the Natives' 25; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls, who managed to get the ball across the try line, allowing Jim Hannan to score. Warbrick for the Natives and Stadden for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries, but there were no further scores in the game.|$|E
5|$|As Boyd took off, another C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel John Delmore {{closed in}} on Khâm Đức. At an {{altitude}} of about 300 to 400 feet, Delmore's aircraft began to receive North Vietnamese fire, and {{both sides of the}} cockpit were opened up by bullets that had ripped through the floorboards. Subsequently, just before <b>touch</b> <b>down,</b> Delmore and his co-pilot shut down the engine and forced the aircraft to remain upright. With no brakes and little directional control, the aircraft crashed into the CH-47 that had been destroyed early in the morning, but Delmore managed to turn his aircraft off the runway to avoid blocking it. When the aircraft had stopped completely, the five-man crew got out as quickly as they could. About 20 minutes later, U.S. soldiers on the ground guided them to safety, and they were rescued by a U.S. Marine CH-46. After witnessing the destruction of two C-130 Hercules, Lieutenant Colonel Franklin Montgomery landed his C-130 and extracted more than 150 Vietnamese civilians, and some CIDG and U.S. soldiers. Montgomery's aircraft suffered no hits, but the loadmaster was knocked down and trampled by panic-stricken Vietnamese civilians whilst trying to maintain order.|$|E
5000|$|Five F1 tornadoes <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> in {{southern}} Minnesota between 2:10 pm [...] - [...] 4:00 pm CDT. Two of these tornadoes caused major damage, both <b>touching</b> <b>down</b> at 3:40 pm {{in different parts}} of the state. One of the tornadoes <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> in the town of Albany. It killed one person and injured 30 others when it hit a flea market. The other tornado <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> in the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities metropolitan area. The tornado <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> in Roseville, and then traveled 12 miles through Shoreview, North Oaks and Lino Lakes before lifting back up into the clouds in Blaine. Seven houses were destroyed and several hundred more were damaged.|$|R
50|$|Widespread tornado {{activity}} was initially not expected on November 16th. However, {{a series of}} supercell thunderstorms developed across the South and produced multiple tornadoes. Tornadoes began <b>touching</b> <b>down</b> across Alabama that afternoon and moved eastward. One long track tornado <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> in Auburn, Alabama and tracked across the Georgia state line into the Hamilton area. This tornado caused EF2 damage in Auburn, Opelika, and Hamilton. A killer tornado later <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> near Rock Hill, South Carolina, and caused severe damage and 3 fatalities. Another destructive EF2 tornado <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> east of Linwood, North Carolina, where numerous homes and businesses were destroyed, 2 people were killed, and numerous people were trapped in destroyed structures and required rescue. A total of 12 tornadoes <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> this day.|$|R
50|$|Three tornadoes <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> east-central Minnesota {{and western}} Wisconsin. The first tornado {{occurred}} in the western suburbs of the Minneapolis - Saint Paul metropolitan area. It <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> shortly after 8:30 pm CDT in Minnetrista, and continued through Orono and Long Lake before dissipating in Plymouth. The EF1 tornado had a path of 9.5 mi and was 200 yd wide. It caused damage to trees, several residences, commercial buildings and boats. Two more tornadoes <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> approximately 90 minutes later in rural areas of western Wisconsin. An EF1 tornado <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> near Burkhardt, damaging several garages in that town and downing several hundred trees. This tornado had a path of 5 mi and did not cause any injuries. A third tornado - rated EF0 - <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> northwest of Hammond and caused only minimal damage.|$|R
5|$|The tornadoes {{continued}} to track through central Alabama that afternoon {{and into the}} early evening hours. A dangerous and destructive tornado struck the city of Cullman, Alabama, at around 3:00p.m. CDT (2000 UTC). This large, multiple-vortex tornado was captured on several tower cameras from television stations such as Fox affiliate WBRC (channel 6) and ABC affiliate WBMA-LD/WCFT-TV/WJSU-TV (channels 58, 33, and 40) out of Birmingham. The tornado caused extensive destruction in downtown Cullman, a city of about 20,000 people; the tornado was ultimately rated an EF4. The final damage count was 867 residences and 94 businesses in Cullman, and 6 people were killed throughout the path. The town of Cordova, Alabama, which had already been damaged by an EF3 tornado from the initial round of storms, was struck by an EF4 tornado that killed 13 people. Two violent EF4 tornadoes also ripped through Jackson County, Alabama, one of which caused a fatality near Bridgeport, while the other passed near Pisgah and into Georgia where it caused major damage in Trenton, killing 14 people along its path. At around 5:10p.m. CDT (2210 UTC), a very large and exceptionally destructive tornado struck Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and about 40 minutes later, the same tornado struck the northern suburbs of nearby Birmingham. A tornado emergency was issued for both cities, {{along with many other}} cities that day. Many local television stations, including WBRC and WBMA-LD/WCFT/WJSU, as well as CBS affiliate WIAT (channel 42), broadcast live footage of this long-tracked tornado in both Tuscaloosa and Birmingham. A debris ball was observed by the Birmingham NEXRAD, indicating that the tornado was causing extreme damage. This tornado killed 64 people and caused extensive devastation in densely populated areas, and the tornado struck several of the same small communities as the April 1956 F4, the April 1977 F5 and the April 1998 F5 tornadoes that hit portions of the Birmingham area. The supercell responsible for the Tuscaloosa/Birmingham EF4 tornado originated in Newton County, Mississippi. The supercell also produced an EF4 tornado later that evening that killed 22 people as it struck areas in and around Ohatchee, Alabama, before eventually crossing into Georgia and causing additional damage near Cave Spring before dissipating. Further to the south, a mile-wide EF3 tornado killed 7 people in mostly rural areas and caused major damage {{in the small town of}} Eoline. The final EF5 tornado of the day caused remarkable damage in and around the town of Rainsville, Alabama, killing 25 people before crossing into Georgia and dissipating. Tornadoes {{continued to}} <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> further to the northeast as the sun set, particularly in Georgia. This included a long-tracked EF4 that caused major damage in Ringgold, Georgia, Apison, Tennessee, and Cleveland, Tennessee, killing 20 people along the path. After dark, violent tornadoes continued to <b>touch</b> <b>down,</b> and a nighttime EF4 tornado destroyed many lakeside homes at Lake Martin in eastern Alabama, killing seven people. Additional strong nighttime tornadoes occurred in Georgia, including an EF3 that killed two people in Barnesville, and another EF3 that destroyed multiple homes and killed one person at Lake Burton.|$|E

25|$|The LCAs for {{the initial}} assault wave were {{scheduled}} to <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> at 02:45, which they managed, {{and in most cases}} at the correct beaches. At approximately 03:15, LCIs and LCTs moving the reserve companies and assaulting battalion's headquarters were to <b>touch</b> <b>down.</b> Unfortunately, this wave was not so successful; a number of craft initially failed to locate their designated beaches, and, arriving 30 to 60 minutes late, delayed the division's movement inland. Soon after, at 03:45, the LCIs and LCTs of the brigade reserve follow-up flight were to be {{in the vicinity of the}} beaches ready to beach when opportunity afforded. All craft were to be beached by first light (04:39) or be in an unsinkable position by that time. To enable loading to be carried out after sunrise, 05:47, arrangements were made for ample smoke canisters to be carried in all craft, so that the area of the landing beaches could be adequately smoked should the need arise.|$|E

5|$|The November 2008 Carolinas tornado {{outbreak}} was a {{brief but}} deadly tornado outbreak which began shortly after midnight (local time), while many people were sleeping. Most of the eight tornadoes that <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> were produced by two supercell thunderstorms over North Carolina. At 12:25a.m. EST, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for most of eastern North Carolina as the risk of tornadoes increased. Not long after, the first tornado of the outbreak, an EF2, <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> in South Carolina. Almost an hour later, the second tornado <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> in Robeson County, North Carolina. Three other minor tornadoes, two EF0 and an EF1, <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> {{over the next two}} hours. Around 3:10a.m. EST, the first of two killer tornadoes <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> near Kenly, North Carolina. The EF2 tornado destroyed a few homes and damaged several others. Roughly 20 minutes later, an EF3 tornado <b>touched</b> <b>down</b> in Wilson County. This tornado killed one person and injured a few others after destroying several homes. Total damages from the outbreak amounted to $2.5million, about half of which was a result of the EF3 tornado.|$|R
25|$|The Singapore {{government}} held {{a public}} {{inquiry into the}} accident under Mr. Justice Knight from 31 May to 16 August. The accident was attributed to poor execution of the approach due to crew tiredness, which exacerbated the pilot's decision to <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> {{near the end of}} the runway. The inquiry determined that, at the time of arrival in Singapore, Captain Hoyle had been on duty for 21½ hours since the flight departed Sydney.|$|E
25|$|Natural events: {{infrasonic}} sound sometimes results naturally {{from severe}} weather, surf, lee waves, avalanches, earthquakes, volcanoes, bolides, waterfalls, calving of icebergs, aurorae, meteors, lightning and upper-atmospheric lightning. Nonlinear ocean wave interactions in ocean storms produce pervasive infrasound vibrations around 0.2Hz, known as microbaroms. According to the Infrasonics Program at NOAA, infrasonic arrays {{can be used}} to locate avalanches in the Rocky Mountains, and to detect tornadoes on the high plains several minutes before they <b>touch</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
