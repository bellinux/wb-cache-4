The paper purposes are to create the new vibrodrive for the special machines, to ground by theory and experiment the characteristics of its working heads. The mathematical model of vibrodrive has been developed and has been studied by machine methods. The prototype of vibrodrive and the system of its automatic-frequency control for resonance operation mode have been created. The results have been introduced at the experimental full-scale rig of Joint-Stock Company "Kalugaputmash"Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E

50|$|The {{station was}} opened on 5 October 1863 by the Kent Coast Railway (KCR). The KCR was {{operated}} by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR), which absorbed the KCR on 1 July 1871, and the station was renamed Birchington-on-Sea by the LCDR in October 1878. From the start of 1899, the LCDR's services were {{operated by the}} newly formed South Eastern and Chatham Railway, which the LCDR co-owned with the South Eastern Railway (SER). At the start of 1923, the LCDR amalgamated with other railways (including the SER) to form the Southern Railway. A small goods yard was situated on the Up London bound side of the station which closed in the 1970s and operated by the signalbox located midway on the down platform closed {{about the same time}} during a resignalling programme. The wire and rod cutout can still be seen within the brick face of the down platform. The 2007 Budget plan of Network Rail allows for the removal of the remaining manual turnround and it is believed short residual siding occasionally used for storing <b>tamping</b> track maintenance <b>units,</b> 'tampers'.A junction existed {{to the west of the}} station to serve RAF Manston until the 1930s operated from a Ground Frame Birchington B located some 440 yd upside of the station - a plan of which can be seen in the RAF Manston Museum.|$|R
