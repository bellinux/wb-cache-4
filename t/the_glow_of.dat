5|$|As a boy, Jinnah {{lived for}} a time in Bombay with an aunt and may have {{attended}} the Gokal Das Tej Primary School there, later on studying at the Cathedral and John Connon School. In Karachi, he attended the Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam and the Christian Missionary Society High School. He gained his matriculation from Bombay University at the high school. In his later years and especially after his death, a large number of stories about the boyhood of Pakistan's founder were circulated: that he spent all his spare time at the police court, listening to the proceedings, and that he studied his books by <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> street lights for lack of other illumination. His official biographer, Hector Bolitho, writing in 1954, interviewed surviving boyhood associates, and obtained a tale that the young Jinnah discouraged other children from playing marbles in the dust, urging them to rise up, keep their hands and clothes clean, and play cricket instead.|$|E
5|$|German {{infantry}} {{began to}} advance near Losheim before the artillery barrage lifted, preparing {{to cross the}} front line {{as soon as it}} ended. They marched under <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> massive searchlights, bouncing light off the clouds. The armor was located farther back, near Blankenheim, Germany. At 8:00, as the sun rose, the American platoon heard explosions and guns around Buchholz Station and Losheimergraben to the east and north where the 3rd and 1st Battalions of the 394th Infantry Division was located. The 55 soldiers of U.S. 2nd Platoon, Company A, 820th Tank Destroyer Battalion, 14th Cavalry Group was initially ordered south to help protect Manderfeld, but shortly afterwards were redirected to join the active battle near Buchholz Station. They withdrew from the village and left without contacting the I&R platoon. This left the platoon as the only unit in the sector and without armor support.|$|E

25|$|Luther Ronzoni Vandross Jr. (April 20, 1951 – July 1, 2005) was an American singer, {{songwriter}} {{and record}} producer. Throughout his career, Vandross was an in-demand background vocalist for several different artists including Judy Collins, Chaka Khan, Bette Midler, Diana Ross, David Bowie, Barbra Streisand, Ben E.

25|$|The phase {{function}} of the giant planet is also a {{function of}} its thermal properties and atmosphere, if any. Therefore, the phase curve may constrain other planet properties, such as the size distribution of atmospheric particles. When a planet is found transiting and its size is known, the phase variations curve helps calculate or constrain the planet's albedo. It is more difficult with very hot planets as <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> the planet can interfere when trying to calculate albedo. In theory, albedo {{can also be found}} in non-transiting planets when observing the light variations with multiple wavelengths. This allows scientists to find the size of the planet even if the planet is not transiting the star.|$|E

25|$|Christmas on the Coosa is {{an annual}} {{series of events}} held in {{during the month of}} December. The event {{location}} is the Bibb Graves Memorial Bridge. The main event is the fireworks display and boat show held on the Coosa River. Observers watch from the Bibb Graves Memorial Bridge as a parade of boats decorated with Christmas lights float down the river under the bridge as fireworks go off. This is a unique experience due to <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> fireworks illuminating the night sky as well as the placid river surface. A host of events proceeds the river show such as Miss Christmas on the Coosa Pageant, Pictures with Santa, tree lighting, and other events centralized around the city's Gold State Park.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> a flame is complex. Black-body {{radiation}} is emitted from soot, gas, and fuel particles, though the soot particles {{are too small}} to behave like perfect blackbodies. There is also photon emission by de-excited atoms and molecules in the gases. Much of the {{radiation is}} emitted in the visible and infrared bands. The color depends on temperature for the black-body radiation, and on chemical makeup for the emission spectra. The dominant color in a flame changes with temperature. The photo of the forest fire in Canada is an excellent example of this variation. Near the ground, where most burning is occurring, the fire is white, the hottest color possible for organic material in general, or yellow. Above the yellow region, the color changes to orange, which is cooler, then red, which is cooler still. Above the red region, combustion no longer occurs, and the uncombusted carbon particles are visible as black smoke.|$|E
25|$|Fifteen of the {{eighteen}} pueblos of Xochimilco hold {{major events}} for Day of the Dead, including costume parades, exhibitions, especially of altars, in cemeteries, museums, plazas and more. The Dolores Olmedo Museum has an annual monumental altar {{to the dead}} for the occasion As per traditions, the cemeteries of smaller communities such as San Francisco Tlalnepantla, Santa Cruz Xochitepec and Santa María Nativitas are lit with <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> numerous candles and loved ones sit vigil over the graves. The best known event associated with Day of the Dead is the “la Cihuacoatle, Leyenda de la Llorona,” which is a spectacle based on the La Llorona spectre, which runs from late October to mid November. It takes place on {{the waters of the}} old Tlilac Lake. Spectators watch the event from trajineras that depart from the Cuemanco docks and travel the canals to reach the lake. Another similar performance is called “Retorno al Mictlan “or Return to Mictlan, the Aztec land of the Dead, which is performed in the historic center of Xochimilco.|$|E

500|$|The show's color {{has been}} {{described}} by Karacas as {{a major part of the}} visuals; inspirations included Paul Klee and Katsuhiro Otomo, as well as the concept of fluorescence. The team wanted to create [...] "a bold, fresh look" [...] that reflected the universe, and so they chose to be minimal with their palette to attract attention to the line work. In addition, they eschewed the use of vivid primary colors and instead chose more secondary colors. However, they took to accentuate the scenes with [...] "pop colors" [...] that mimic <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> neon lighting, and lastly they added vertical reflections to the floors and grunge textures to the backgrounds.|$|E

Smaller in size than [...] "boat anchors", [...] "glowbug" [...] is a term used by US amateurs to describe a simple home-made tube-type radio set, reminiscent of the shortwave radio-building craze of the 1920s and 1930s. [...] "Glow" [...] refers to <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> the vacuum tubes and [...] "bug" [...] to the gear's relatively diminutive size.

500|$|In 1931 Cardus {{visited the}} Salzburg Festival, {{where he met}} Beecham and began a {{friendship}} which lasted until Sir Thomas's death in 1961—despite numerous disagreements. One of Cardus's notices in 1937 so incensed Beecham that he announced he would not conduct any concert at which Cardus was present. Cardus later numbered Beecham, with Elgar and Delius, as [...] "one of the three most original spirits known in English music since Purcell". The annual Salzburg Festival became a highlight of Cardus's musical calendar; in 1936 he saw Toscanini conduct a performance there of Wagner's Die Meistersinger that, he said, [...] "will remain in the mind for a lifetime... Toscanini held us like children listening to a tale told in the chimney corner, lighted by <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> olden times". Cardus's final prewar Salzburg visit was in 1938, just after the German-Austrian Anschluss {{which led to the}} withdrawal in protest of many of the Festival's leading figures.|$|E

Matt Kivel of Variety said, [...] "the crowd reacted wildly to all of it: screaming out the chorus to 'I'm a Slave 4 U,' pulsating along to the twitch of 'Gimme More' and going absolutely ballistic for the brief, two-verse rendition of '...Baby One More Time.'" [...] Craig S.

500|$|John Aikin, in {{a review}} for the April 1796 Monthly Review, claimed, [...] "We were sorry to observer, {{in the preface to}} this work, certain facts stated in order to display the extreme rapidity with which it was written. An epic poem in 12books {{finished}} in six weeks, and, on its improved plan in 10books, almost entirely recomposed during the time of printing! Is it possible that a person of classical education have so slight an opinion of (perhaps) the most arduous effort of human invention, as to suffer the fervour and confidence of youth to hurry him in such a manner through a design which may fix the reputation of a whole life?" [...] The review continued: [...] "To proceed to the execution of the design: we do not hesitate to declare our opinion that the poetical powers displayed in it are of a very superior kind, and such as, if not wasted in premature and negligent exertions, promise a rich harvest of future excellence. Conceptions more lofty and daring, sentiments more commanding, and language more energetic than some of the best passages in this poem afford, will not easily be found:—nor does scarcely any part of it sink to languor; as <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> feeling and genius animates the whole." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reviews of}} Five Days at Memorial were mostly positive.

Another New York Times critic, bioethicist Sherwin B. Nuland, felt the book displayed [...] "masterly reporting and <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> fine writing" [...] and offered particular praise for the tone and language of Fink's writing. The Independent Hirsh Sawhney admired the detail and variety of perspectives offered {{in the book and}} described the book as [...] "soar to artistic and intellectual heights undreamed of in other realms of media". Peter Beaumont, writing for The Guardian, found parts of the book awkward in structure, but felt that overall it was [...] "tight, provocative and gripping" [...] with a [...] "fair and deeply sympathetic" [...] approach to the involved parties. A review by John B. Saul in The Seattle Times commended Fink's ability to produce a [...] "compelling and revealing account" [...] of events despite limited access to evidence such as investigative reports and Pou's testimony, while the Star Tribune Curt Schleier described Five Days at Memorial as [...] "an important book that will make your blood boil no matter which side of the issue you support".|$|E
