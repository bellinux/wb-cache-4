40|$|International audienceThe {{molecular}} dynamics (MD) simulation technique {{has been applied}} to investigate fundamental aspects of matrix-assisted laser desorption. In this paper, we focus on direct comparisons of the results from the simulations with experimental data and on establishing links between the measured or calculated parameters and the basic mechanisms of molecular ejection. The results on the fluence dependence of the ablation/desorption yields and composition of the ejected plume are compared with mass spectrometry and <b>trapping</b> <b>plate</b> experiments. Implications of the prediction of a fluence threshold for ablation are discussed. The strongly forward-peaked velocity and angular distributions of matrix and analyte molecules, predicted in the simulations, are related to the experimental distributions. The shapes and amplitudes of the acoustic waves transmitted from the absorption region through the irradiated sample are compared to recent photoacoustic measurements and related to the ejection mechanisms. The conformational changes during plume evolution and the ejection velocities of analyte molecules are studied and the directions for future investigations are discussed. Finally, we demonstrate that the MD simulation technique can be used to model other processes relevant to mass spectrometry applications, such as laser disintegration of aerosol particles and laser ablation in the presence of photochemical reactions...|$|E
40|$|Surface-induced {{dissociation}} (SID) and collision-induced dissociation (CID) are ion activation techniques {{based on}} energetic collisions with a surface or gas molecule, respectively. One noticeable difference between CID and SID is that SID {{does not require}} a collision gas for ion activation and is, therefore, directly compatible with the high vacuum requirement of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometers. Eliminating the introduction of collision gas into the ICR cell for collisional activation dramatically shortens the acquisition time for MS/MS experiments, suggesting that SID could be utilized for high-throughput MS/MS studies in FT-ICR MS. We demonstrate {{for the first time the}} utility of SID combined with FT-ICR MS for protein identification. Tryptic digests of standard proteins were analyzed using a hybrid 6 -tesla FT-ICR mass spectrometer with SID and CID capabilities. SID spectra of mass-selected singly and doubly charged peptides were obtained using a diamond-coated target mounted at the rear <b>trapping</b> <b>plate</b> of the ICR cell. The broad internal energy distribution deposited into the precursor ion following collision with the diamond surface allowed a variety of fragmentation channels to be accessed by SID. Composition and sequence qualifiers produced by SID of tryptic peptides were used to improve the statistical significance of database searches. Protein identification MASCOT scores obtained using SID were comparable or better than scores obtained using sustained off-resonance irradiation collision-induced dissociation (SORI-CID), the conventional ion activation technique in FT-ICR MS...|$|E

Trapping periods extracted from these profiles are found to vary linearly with cell length of elongated cells.

40|$|A simple {{procedure}} is described that increases sensitivity and dynamic range {{for the analysis}} of a proteome batch digest by FT-ICR mass spectrometry. Ions at the low and high mass ranges are preferentially collected using two different sets of tuning conditions. By combing data collected using tuning conditions that favor low mass (m/z 2000) ions, 277 proteins are identified for a whole cell lysate of Methanococcus maripaludis in a single HPLC-MALDI FT-ICR mass spectrometry experiment, a 70 % improvement compared with previous analyses using a wide mass range acquisition. This procedure improves the detection of low abundance ions and thereby increases the range of proteins that are observed. Because the observed mass range is effectively narrower for each spectrum, mass calibration is more accurate than for the standard method that provides a wide range of masses.

With a tilt rotor, the wing turns some of the rotor downwash inboard. When the flows meet, some of the flow is forced upward creating a fountain. Some of the fountain is ingested into the rotor disc.

Eighty-five percent of conidia settled out within a 0. 5 -m radius when air-conditioning fans were switched off, consistent with airborne spore dispersal. Alternative methods for treating diseased areas to minimize conidial release and distribution were investigated and included covering disease colonies with damp paper tissue prior to salt application (tissue salting) and holding a dust extractor above disease colonies during salt application.

40|$|A 7 -Tesla Fourier {{transform}} ion-cyclotron resonance (FTICR) {{mass spectrometer}} was modified to insert a surface inside the cell for ion-surface collisions {{leading to the}} dissociation of impacting ions. Modifications {{were made to the}} software/hardware to collide the ions brought into the cell and trap the resulting fragment and undissociated primary ions inside the cell. The <b>trapping</b> <b>plates</b> were also ramped to determine kinetic energy distributions of these ions. The surface-induced dissociation (SID) of benzene and chromium hexacarbonyl ions was first studied as test cases for the instrument. Then a systematic study of the SID of small protonated peptides formed by electrospray ionization was begun. A series of small alanine(A) -containing peptides, viz., AA, AAA, AAAA, AAAAA, and PAAAA were used in the study. In the absence of any direct comparisons of the SID processes with the commonly used technique of tandem mass spectrometry of collision-induced dissociations (CID) via collisions with a neutral gas, a comparative study of CID and SID using the same protonated peptides was made. Since multiple collisions are often used to enhance dissociation efficiency in CID, the CID was performed under single as well as multiple collisional activation conditions. Both on-resonance and sustained off-resonance irradiation excitation were used for CID experiments. Kinetic energy of the ions was varied by changing peak-to-peak voltage applied to the excitation plates. Results are shown in a series of graphs, and a simple theoretical model is presented. This direct comparison of the two activation techniques on the same instrument provided insights into the similarities and differences between these two. The results suggest that internal energy distributions of ions activated by ion-surface collision and multiple collision ion-gaseous neutral collisions are quite comparable. The results also suggest that, in ion-surface collisions, the ion collides with {{only a small fraction of}} th e self-assembled monolayer chain, making it effectively a process very similar to CID...|$|R

40|$|Clasts of metamorphosed mafic {{igneous rock}} of diverse {{composition}} were recovered in two drill sites on a serpentine mud volcano {{in the outer}} Mariana forearc during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 125. These clasts are xenolithic fragments that have been entrained in the rising serpentine mud, and make up less that 9 % of the total rock recovered at Sites 778 and 779. Most samples are metabasalt or metadiabase, although one clast of possible boninite and one cumulate gabbro were recovered. On the basis of trace element signatures, samples are interpreted to represent both arc-derived and mid-ocean ridge-derived compositions. Rocks with extremely low TiO 2 (3. 9) may represent island arc rocks similar to shoshonites. However, the K 2 O/Na 2 O ratios are much higher than those reported for shoshonites from modem or ancient arcs and {{may be the result}} of metamorphism. Samples with moderate TiO 2 (1. 4 to 1. 5 wt%) and Zr (72 to 85 ppm) are similar to rocks from mid-ocean ridges. A few samples have TiO 2 and Zr intermediate between island arc and mid-ocean ridge basalt-like rocks. Two samples have high iron (Fe 2 O 3 * = > 12. 8 to 18. 5 wt%) (Fe 2 O 3 * = total iron calculated as Fe 2 O 3) and TiO 2 (> 2. 3 wt%) and resemble FeTi basalt recovered from mid-ocean ridges. Metamorphism in most samples ranges from low-temperature zeolite, typical of ocean floor weathering, to prehnite-pumpellyite facies and perhaps lower greenschist. Blue amphibole and lawsonite minerals are present in several samples. One diabase clast (Sample 9) exhibits Ca enrichment, similar to rodingite metamorphism, typical of mafic blocks in serpentinized masses. The presence of both low-grade (clays and zeolites) and higher grade (lawsonite) metamorphism indicates retrograde processes in these clasts. These clasts are fragments of the forearc crust and possibly of the subducting plate that have been entrained in the rising serpentine and may represent the deepest mafic rocks ever recovered from the Mariana forearc. The variable compositions and degree of metamorphism of these clasts requires at least two tectonic origins. The recovery of clasts with mid-ocean ridge and arc chemical affinities in a single drill hole requires these clasts to have been "mixed" on a small scale either (1) in the forearc crustal sequence, or (2) after inclusion in the rising serpentine mud. The source of the MORB-like samples and an explanation for the presence of both MORB-like and arc-like rocks in close proximity is critical to any model of the evolution of the Mariana forearc.

Mean characteristic parameters (!. t, !. t* • and [) are used to discuss the mechanical stability of 28 transects across the frontal part of convergent margins where the Coulomb theory is applicable. Natural observations reveal that "typical accretionary wedges" are characterized by low tapers with smooth surface slope and subducting plate, low convergence rates and thick trench sediment, while "nonaccretionary wedges" display large tapers with irregular surface slopes and rough subducting plate, high convergence rates and almost no trench fill. Sandbox experiments were performed to illustrate the effects of seamounts/ridges in the subduction zone on the deformation of an accretionary wedge. These experiments show that a wedge of sand is first trapped and pushed {{in front of the}} seamount which acts as a moving bulldozer. This is followed by a tunnelling effect of the subducting seamount through the frontal wedge material, which results in considerable sand reworking. At an advanced subduction stage, the d 6 collement jumps back from a high level in the wedge to its former basal position. We conclude that a high trench sedimentation rate relative to the convergence rate leads to frontal accretion. In contrast, several conditions may favor tectonic erosion of the upper plate. First, oceanic features, such as grabens, seamounts or ridges, may <b>trap</b> upper <b>plate</b> material during their subduction process. Second, destabilization of the upper plate material by internal fluid overpressuring causing hydrofracturing is probably another important mechanism...|$|R
