At this point, the remaining eleven tanks of the Barak Brigade arrived, and Eitan directed them to Ben-Gal. Eitan told Ben-Gal of Ben-Hanan's force. Kahalani called Captain Emi Palant, the senior officer behind the ramps, to use a signal flag to get the tank commanders' attention and direct them to the ramp, but waving the flag got no response. Palant fired his machine gun {{at the side of the}} nearest tank to get the commander to look out, and the message was passed. He ran from tank to tank and rapped on their turrets <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>attention</b> before returning to his own tank and starting to move forward. No tank followed. Kahalani heard a sergeant from the 74th Battalion and ordered him to take his position and guard the wadi. The sergeant replied he did not have any shells left. Zamir, who was flanking his position to the south, reported a massive Syrian attack and asked for permission to move the remaining tanks to Zamir's company to a better position slightly to the south. Ben-Gal refused. Kahalani reported that he was unable to control the tanks, which kept drifting to the rear. Ben-Gal said he would try to get him more tanks. Kahalani ordered the sergeant to take his place, saying the Syrians would not try to attack if they saw his tank.|$|E

40|$|Criminal {{harassment}} {{became a}} criminal offence in Canada in 1993, {{in part to}} protect women who face increased risks of violence when leaving abusive relationships. This dissertation provides a critical socio-legal analysis of 526 criminal harassment court decisions reported in QuickLaw from 1993 to 2006. The research employs both quantitative and qualitative techniques through a critical and gendered lens and is best characterized as constructivist and inductive. Demographic data regarding offenders and victims, and characteristics of criminal harassment are compared with official data and other analogous studies. Three major themes emerged from the qualitative coding of the cases. The first theme shows that judicial interpretations of the credibility of both offenders and victims sometimes come down to: a contest between the accused and the victim; a “blaming” game; or a discussion of what is reasonable in the circumstances. A second theme concerns {{the role of the}} psy professions and risk assessment in criminal harassment sentencing decisions. The extant literature suggests that psy experts {{play a significant role in}} the cases. Analysis, however, found their role was minimal, yet judges sometimes make use of psy language in the absence of expert opinions and reports. The final theme examines the gendered construction of criminal harassment showing that offenders are sometimes characterized as unable to “let go” of a relationship, or will do anything <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> former intimates’ <b>attention.</b> The offenders’ behaviours escalate to criminal harassment perpetuating power and control issues that seem to be inevitable in abusive relationships. Judicial decisions are examined within a socio-legal context, including the constraints judges face given the adversarial system in which they operate. In contrast to much of the existing literature, the judicial decisions in this study show encouraging results in that, for the most part, the judges appear to take criminal harassment seriously as evidenced by the sentences they impose. There is, however, a disjuncture between judicial decisions and policies designed to protect women from intimate violence. Until coordinated efforts resolve systemic and structural problems at a much earlier stage in the process, there will be no end to violence against women...|$|R
40|$|Background: Prior {{studies have}} shown that joint {{attention}} (JA) behaviors and episodes, which involve person-person-object awareness, serve an important role in toddlers’ cognitive and social development. There are two forms of JA behaviors in which a toddler can engage: responding joint attention (RJA) behavior in which the toddler shifts attention to an object to which the mother is attending, and initiating joint attention (IJA) behavior in which a toddler bids for the mother’s attention around an object. If a JA behavior is responded to, it becomes a JA episode. Prior research suggests that these different JA behaviors (RJA and IJA) rely on different underlying cognitive processes (Mundy, Card, & Fox, 2000; Vaughan Van Hecke et al., 2007). Furthermore, prior research has made a distinction between earlier (gaze following) and later developing (pointing and showing) forms of RJA and IJA behaviors because these behaviors occur at different points of development (Tomasello, 1995; Vaughn van Hecke et al., 2007). Specifically, gaze following occurs earlier in development than showing and pointing (Van Hecke et al., 2005). The few studies that have examined RJA and IJA behaviors in toddlers born very low birth weight (VLBW) have been mixed, with some studies suggesting toddlers born VLBW show deficits in RJA but not in IJA behaviors (Landry, Schmidt, & Richardson, 1989) and other studies suggesting toddlers born VLBW show deficits in both RJA and IJA behaviors (De Schuymer et al., 2011). To our knowledge, only one study has explored joint attention episodes in a VLBW sample, and no study has examined RJA and IJA behaviors examining gaze and point behaviors separately within this population. The current study hypothesized birth weight group (VLBW, normal birth weight (NBW)) differences in RJA-gaze, RJA-point, IJA-gaze, and IJA-point behaviors such that toddlers born VLBW would engage in fewer of these behaviors than toddlers born NBW. It was further hypothesized that toddlers born VLBW would engage in fewer RJA-point, RJA-gaze, IJA-gaze, and IJA-point episodes with their mothers compared with toddlers born NBW. It was also hypothesized {{that there would be no}} group differences in “missed episodes. ” Methods: Participants included 52 toddler-mother dyads (50 % VLBW) between the ages of 18 and 22 months (M = 19. 0). The VLBW cohort was born under 1, 250 g and at fewer than 32 weeks (N = 26, 46 % female); and the NBW cohort was born at or after 37 weeks gestation (N = 26, 42 % female). Mothers completed a set of sociodemographic questionnaires, and mother-toddler dyads were videotaped for 10 minutes of free play with a set of toys. Joint attention behaviors and episodes were coded using Tasker’s (2012) Coding Manual for Mother-Child Joint Attention. RJA-gaze behaviors included the toddler’s attention shift to a mother’s gaze, and RJA-point behaviors included the toddler shifting attention to the mother’s point to a toy. IJA-gaze behaviors were defined by a toddler trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> mother’s <b>attention</b> by glancing at an object, and IJA-point behaviors were defined by a toddler trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> mother’s <b>attention</b> by pointing and showing an object (Tasker & Schmdit, 2008; Tasker, 2012; Mundy et al. 2007). If the JA behavior was responded to within 5 seconds, then this was considered a successful episode (Tasker, 2012). If no response occurred to the JA behavior, it was considered a “miss. ” These JA episodes were divided into four types of JA, which can be distinguished by the “successful” JA behavior that began the episode: RJA-gaze, RJA-point, IJA-gaze, and IJA-point. Inter-rater reliability was considered almost perfect with all Fleiss Kappas >. 94. Results: RJA-gaze behaviors did not differ significantly by birth weight group. However, toddlers born VLBW displayed significantly less RJA-point behaviors than toddlers born NBW. Contrary to hypotheses, toddlers born VLBW displayed more IJA-gaze behaviors than their NBW counterparts. IJA-point behaviors did not significantly differ by birth weight group. JA episode findings paralleled JA behavior findings. RJA-gaze episodes did not significantly differ by birth weight group. Toddlers born VLBW and their mothers displayed significantly fewer RJA-point episodes than toddlers born NBW. Interestingly, toddlers born VLBW displayed more IJA-gaze episodes than toddlers born NBW. IJA-point episodes did not differ significantly by birth weight group. As expected, toddlers born VLBW and born NBW did not differ in the number of JA misses. Conclusions: These findings partially support the hypothesis that JA behaviors and episodes differ by birth weight group. As expected, toddlers born VLBW engaged in fewer RJA-point behaviors and episodes than toddlers born NBW. Differences in RJA-point behaviors and episodes show that, in this sample, mothers of toddlers born VLBW bid less frequently for <b>their</b> toddlers’ <b>attention</b> by pointing and showing than did mothers of toddlers born NBW. This study found no differences between groups for RJA-gaze behaviors and episodes, and this may be due to the low frequency of occurrence of these behaviors and episodes for toddlers born VLBW as well as NBW. The finding that toddlers born VLBW displayed more IJA-gaze behaviors and episodes than toddlers born NBW was not anticipated. One possible explanation for this finding is a methodological artifact in the coding system: an IJA episode may not have entailed an intention from the toddler to engage in an episode but rather included a mother being more sensitive to her toddler’s behavior. Mothers of toddlers born VLBW may notice exactly when their toddler shifts his/her attention to another object and may begin play around the object without the toddler having intended to engage with the mother. This maternal sensitivity to the shift in <b>their</b> toddler’s <b>attention</b> may be propelling the toddler’s gaze behavior into joint attention gaze episodes. In addition, if increased maternal sensitivity by mothers of VLBW toddlers explains the increased IJA-gaze behavior and episodes found among this group, it may also explain the lower frequency of RJA-point behavior and episodes in this group: mothers of toddlers born VLBW may be highly responsive to their toddler’s cues and, simultaneously, not initiating many point and show behaviors to gain <b>their</b> toddler’s <b>attention.</b> If this hypothesis about the coding system is correct, these data would suggest that mothers of toddlers born VLBW show greater sensitivity to their toddlers’ behavior rather than the alternative interpretation that toddlers born VLBW exhibit more gaze initiation behaviors. This unique finding is congruent with the literature to the extent that mothers of toddlers born VLBW have been found to be more responsive to their toddler’s behavior (Salerni, Suttora, & D’Odorico, 2007). Whether this explains the greater number of IJA-gaze behavior episodes among the VLBW dyads remains to be investigated. No differences were found between birth weight groups on IJA-point behaviors or episodes. Interestingly, almost all JA behaviors for both groups became JA episodes, as there were very few JA misses. Overall, the current study’s results suggest similarities as well as differences in JA behaviors and episodes for toddlers born VLBW compared to toddlers born NBW. If further corroborated, these findings may suggest early intervention targets for mothers of toddlers born VLBW that include supporting more initiation of RJA with their toddlers.
