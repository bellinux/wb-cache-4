25|$|A {{station is}} set by specifying an artist or song, or a {{combination}} of multiple items of any kind in a single station. Listeners can tune into established genre stations, other users' stations or create their own stations based on their musical interests. Each track played can be responded to with favorable (<b>thumbs</b> <b>up)</b> or unfavorable (thumbs down) buttons, which determine if it should be played, and if similarly classified songs should be played in the station. A second negative response to the same artist will ban that artist from the selected station unless the user has marked the artist positively on another occasion or if that artist is listed under the station's variety. No response is applicable to musical attributes or to albums. An unfavorable response immediately stops play of the track. Clicking the thumbs down or skipping to the next song too many times in a row will result in a short ban of skips. Pandora also utilizes short advertisements between every couple of songs.|$|E
