5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, <b>Tenar.</b> Though she nominally has a position of high authority, <b>Tenar</b> feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and desires to escape to a place where she can make her own choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct social consequences. While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, in particular, with its twists and turns, is a metaphor for Tenar's exploration of her own thoughts. In this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within <b>Tenar,</b> which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E
5|$|The {{early part}} of the story {{provides}} an anthropological view of the culture of the Tombs, and through them, of the Kargish lands as a whole. The reader is shown that the true names of people have no particular significance in the Kargish lands, whereas in the Archipelago they grant power over the thing being named; nonetheless, the critical moment in which <b>Tenar</b> recalls her true name has been described as influencing other works such as Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 film Spirited Away. Scholars have described Le Guin's depiction of Kargish culture as a subtle critique, particularly of the powers of the Tombs, which give nothing in return for their worship. Much of the {{early part of}} the novel describes the life that <b>Tenar</b> leads in the stable world of the Tombs. Ged's arrival acts as a turning point, and the rest of the book explores the possibility of change, and introduces different perspectives on the internal world of the novel.|$|E
5|$|Arha and Kossil have {{a public}} falling out in which Kossil says that nobody {{believes}} in the Nameless Ones anymore. In response Arha curses her {{in the name of}} the Nameless Ones. Realizing that Kossil will now be determined to kill her, she heads underground to the labyrinth, and sees Kossil uncovering the false grave. Evading her, Arha goes to the treasury and confesses everything to Ged, who has found the other half of Erreth-Akbe's ring in the treasury. He tells Arha that she must either kill him or escape with him, and says that the Nameless Ones demand her service but give nothing and create nothing in return. He tells her his true name, Ged, in return for the trust she has shown him. They escape together, though Manan, who has come looking for Arha, falls into a pit in the labyrinth and is killed. The tombs begin to collapse in on themselves; Ged holds them off until they leave. Arha reverts to calling herself <b>Tenar</b> as she and Ged travel to the coast where his boat is hidden. While waiting for the tide she has an urge to kill Ged for destroying her life, but realizes while gazing at him that she has no anger left. Ged and <b>Tenar</b> return to Havnor, where they are received in triumph.|$|E

500|$|The form of {{narrative}} employed by Le Guin in the Earthsea trilogy {{has been described}} by literature scholar Mike Cadden as [...] "free indirect discourse"; a technique in which the feelings of the protagonist are not directly separated from the narration, making the narrator seem sympathetic to the characters, and removing the skepticism towards a character's thoughts and emotions that are a feature of more direct narration. Cadden suggests that this method leads to younger readers sympathizing directly with the characters, thereby making it an effective technique for young-adult literature, whereas adults are likely to read the situations differently. In The Tombs of Atuan, much of the story is told from <b>Tenar's</b> perspective; for instance, the reader sees <b>Tenar's</b> fear of the undertomb through her own eyes, creating an empathy for her.|$|R
500|$|Gender {{and power}} feature as themes through The Tombs of Atuan. The {{labyrinth}} {{has been described}} as a tomb for the lives that Kargish women could have led. Le Guin herself stated that the theme of The Tombs of Atuan was sex, a statement which reviewers have suggested meant not physical intimacy, but yearning and the recognition of potential for intimacy. [...] The role of the women priestesses at the Tombs is analogous to that of Kargish women in their society; though the priestesses have eunuch servants and male guards ostensibly to protect them, the Tombs are a prison, and act to isolate the women from the rest of society. The priestesses have internalized this situation, and act to enforce it: Kossil's cruelty is described as epitomizing this. Brought into this environment, <b>Tenar's</b> development as a person is not the result of choices she made, as is the case with Ged in A Wizard of Earthsea; instead, her coming of age is forced upon her.|$|R
5|$|Though the {{structure}} of the Earthsea novels is in many ways typical of fantasy, it has been described as subverting the tropes of this genre. The protagonists of her stories, with the exception of <b>Tenar,</b> were all dark-skinned, in comparison to the white-skinned heroes more traditionally used. The Tombs of Atuan examines the development of a young girl in great detail, a choice unusual for a fantasy writer of the period in which the book was written.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that <b>Tenar</b> does not become a wizard (like Ged) or a king (like Arren, the primary {{character}} of The Farthest Shore), Cummins argues that her growth is more revolutionary than either of theirs. In contrast to the male bildungsroman in which characters grow into the characteristics society believes they should have, Tenar's coming of age is a female bildungsroman, in which she must struggle against the patriarchal Kargish empire. She learns to value herself for herself and not simply {{for her role as}} a priestess. She is helped through this process by Ged, who sees her as a powerful person, and helps her find choices that she did not see. Over the course of the story she realized that her true power is not her authority as the reincarnated high priestess, but the ability to make the choice to leave the labyrinth and the Tombs. Le Guin suggests that true power is not only about authority and mastery, but trust and collaboration.|$|E
25|$|Mungilpallam (Moongilpallam) {{village at}} , at the {{headwaters}} of the <b>TenAr,</b> the third village going up the valley, is a hamlet of just 20 houses of Pulaiyar people (pop: m-22, f-18), on the north side and above the Kumbaar stream. They practice some shifting cultivation on their south facing slope. There is a steep cliff trail from here which leads east to Kumboor village {{at the end of the}} road from Kodaikanal.|$|E
500|$|A shorter {{version of}} The Tombs of Atuan was {{published}} in the magazine Worlds of Fantasy in the Winter 1970 issue. The complete version was published by Atheneum Books in 1971. It was the second book of the original Earthsea [...] "trilogy", being preceded by A Wizard of Earthsea, and followed by The Farthest Shore in 1972. The Tombs of Atuan has since been translated into more than 20 languages, and has been reprinted many times. The first three Earthsea novels received critical acclaim as works for children when they were published. The classification of the original trilogy as children's literature was decried by many critics, such as Barbara Bucknall, who stated that the stories were [...] "ageless because they deal with problems that confront us at any age", and could be read by both children and adults. It took several decades and the publication of a fourth novel, Tehanu for the series to be recognized as adult literature. Two more books were published in subsequent years; Tales from Earthsea and The Other Wind, both in 2001. These books, along with Tehanu, have sometimes been referred to as a second trilogy. Tehanu {{has been described as a}} rewriting or reimagining of The Tombs of Atuan, because <b>Tenar's</b> power and status are the inverse of what they were in the earlier book. In 2005 an original mini-series titled Legend of Earthsea, based loosely on the first two Earthsea books was broadcast on the Sci Fi Channel. Le Guin expressed strong displeasure with the result, which she said had [...] "whitewashed Earthsea".|$|R
500|$|The {{short stories}} {{published}} in 1964 introduced {{the world of}} Earthsea and important concepts in it, such as Le Guin's treatment of magic. Le Guin's depiction of Earthsea was influenced by her familiarity with Native American legends as well as Norse mythology. The influence of Norse lore {{can be seen in}} the characters of the Kargs, who are blonde and blue-eyed, and worship two gods who are brothers. Influential in The Tombs of Atuan is Le Guin's familiarity with anthropology, visible in her description of Kargish culture and cultural differences with the rest of Earthsea. Le Guin's belief in Taoism is visible in the idea of a cosmic [...] "balance" [...] in the universe of Earthsea. Le Guin originally intended for A Wizard of Earthsea to be a standalone novel, but she wrote The Tombs of Atuan as a sequel after considering the loose ends in the first book, and wrote a third book, The Farthest Shore, a year later after further consideration. Scholars have stated that the civil rights movement, and opposition to the Vietnam War that was gaining prominence during the period The Tombs of Atuan was written, subtly affected the structure of the book. Although not a [...] "primarily feminist" [...] novel, Le Guin's decision to choose a female protagonist has been described as a nod to the women's rights movement, while <b>Tenar's</b> growing disquiet with her beliefs has been compared to the unease of individuals who began to protest discrimination and the Vietnam War.|$|R

25|$|In April and May 2015, BBC Radio 4 aired a new, six-part dramatization of the Earthsea works, {{encompassing}} the storylines and motifs of {{the novels}} A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan and The Farthest Shore. The {{first of the}} six 30 minute-long episodes premiered on April 27 and the last on May 5. The characters of Ged and <b>Tenar</b> were portrayed by three different actors at different stages in their lives (Kasper Hilton-Hille, James McArdle and Shaun Dooley as Ged; Nishi Malde, Aysha Kala and Vineeta Rishi as <b>Tenar).</b> The radio drama was adapted by Judith Adams, directed by Sasha Yevtushenko and featured original music composed by Jon Nicholls. Following the premiere radio broadcast, each of the episodes were made available for online streaming on BBC Radio 4 Extra for a month, via the BBC iPlayer service. The adaptation was created and aired {{as part of a}} thematic month centered on the life and works of Ursula Le Guin, in commemoration of her then-recent 85th birthday. In addition to the Earthsea radio drama, the thematic month included the airing of a two-part radio adaptation of The Left Hand of Darkness earlier in April, as well as exclusive interviews with Le Guin and some of the writers she inspired.|$|E
500|$|Ged, who in {{the story}} goes by his common name of Sparrowhawk, only enters the novel midway through {{when he comes to}} the tombs to steal the ring of Erreth-Akbe. Where he was an {{adolescent}} in A Wizard of Earthsea, he is depicted as a mature individual in the second Earthsea volume, one who gradually transforms Tenar's view of the world. In The Tombs of Atuan he plays the role of the wise helper to the protagonist, a type of companionship common to Le Guin's novels. After <b>Tenar</b> chooses to talk to him rather than have him killed, he tells her about the rest of Earthsea that she is ignorant of, and so helps her see a path out of her difficulties that she could not. The scars that Ged bears from his encounter with the shadow in A Wizard of Earthsea make <b>Tenar</b> realize that he has confronted death in a way that she has never done. Literature scholar Elizabeth Cummins argues that while Ged does not actually save <b>Tenar,</b> he [...] "functions as the midwife in her rebirth". Ged is the figure of the [...] "other" [...] in this novel; in contrast to the other inhabitants of the Tombs, he is male, dark-skinned, and a wizard. Ged's difference in the story is symbolized by light on many occasions, such as when his staff allows <b>Tenar</b> to see the undertomb for the first time: she is shocked then to find it to be beautiful, rather than just dark. Ged is responsible for giving <b>Tenar</b> a wider perspective and showing her a more compassionate and joyful world than her previous experience allowed her to imagine.|$|E
500|$|The story {{follows a}} girl named <b>Tenar,</b> born on the Kargish island of Atuan. Born {{on the day that}} the high priestess of the Tombs of Atuan died, she is {{believed}} to be her reincarnation. <b>Tenar</b> is taken from her family when five years old and goes to the Tombs. Her name is taken from her in a ceremony, and she is referred to as [...] "Arha", or the [...] "eaten one", after being consecrated to the service of the [...] "Nameless Ones" [...] at the age of six with a ceremony involving a symbolic sacrifice. She moves into her own tiny house, and is given a eunuch servant, Manan, with whom she develops a bond of affection.|$|E
5000|$|The {{short stories}} {{published}} in 1964 introduced {{the world of}} Earthsea and important concepts in it, such as Le Guin's treatment of magic.

500|$|Set in {{the fictional}} world of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan follows the story of <b>Tenar,</b> a young girl born in the Kargish empire, who is taken while still a child to be the high priestess to the [...] "Nameless Ones" [...] at the Tombs of Atuan. Her {{existence}} at the Tombs is a lonely one, deepened by the isolation of being the highest ranking priestess. Her world is disrupted {{by the arrival of}} Ged, the fictional protagonist of A Wizard of Earthsea, who seeks to steal the half of a talisman buried in the treasury of the Tombs. <b>Tenar</b> traps him in the labyrinth under the Tombs, but then rebels against her teaching and keeps him alive. Through him she learns more of the outside world, and begins to question her faith in the Nameless Ones and her place at the Tombs.|$|E
500|$|Like A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman that explores Tenar's {{growth and}} identity. Tenar's coming-of-age is {{closely tied to}} her {{exploration}} of faith and her belief in the Nameless Ones. The Tombs of Atuan [...] explores themes of gender and power {{in the setting of}} a cult of female priests in service to a patriarchal society, while providing an anthropological view of Kargish culture. <b>Tenar,</b> who became the subject of Le Guin's fourth Earthsea novel, Tehanu, {{has been described as a}} more revolutionary protagonist than Ged, or Arren, the protagonist of The Farthest Shore (1972), the third Earthsea volume. Whereas the two men grow into socially approved roles, <b>Tenar</b> rebels and struggles against the confines of her social role. The Tombs of Atuan shares elements of the story of a heroic quest with other Earthsea novels, but subverts some of the tropes common to the genre of fantasy at the time, such as by choosing a female protagonist, and a dark-skinned character.|$|E
500|$|<b>Tenar,</b> from whose {{perspective}} The Tombs of Atuan is told, is {{born on the}} Kargish {{island of}} Atuan before being taken away to serve the Nameless Ones as their high priestess. She is told {{that she is the}} reincarnation of the high priestess, and has lived at the tombs since time immemorial; though she believes this early in her life, she begins to question the idea later in the novel. For much of the book she is known only as Arha, or the [...] "Eaten one"; her identity as an individual is gradually erased. Though she is depicted as a person of strength and imagination, her development is stunted by the priestesses; her feelings are repressed, and her mind has no place to wander except the labyrinth. After trapping Ged, she talks to him about the rest of Earthsea, and begins to desire a life outside the barrenness of the Tombs. It is only after her escape that she seems to regain her name, crying [...] "I have my name back. I am Tenar!" [...] Tehanu, the fourth Earthsea novel, is narrated from Tenar's point of view; it depicts her life on Gont and her reunion and relationship with Ged. She reappears in The Other Wind, the sixth Earthsea book. <b>Tenar</b> plays the role of a heroine in The Tombs of Atuan, in which she is somewhat stereotypically cast as a [...] "side-kick" [...] to Ged, but later breaks out of this role to become a central character in her own right in Tehanu. <b>Tenar</b> is part of multiple pairs of characters that develop together; both Ged, in The Tombs of Atuan, and later Tehanu in her eponymous novel, are shown as being dependent on her.|$|E
500|$|<b>Tenar</b> {{begins to}} {{question}} her beliefs {{when she hears}} Kossil defying the Nameless Ones, and sees {{that they do not}} punish her. She has a conversation with Penthe, her only friend, who expresses an [...] "unfaith" [...] in the divinity of the God-king. Though <b>Tenar</b> reacts to this with shock, the incident opens a new perspective to her. In her own thoughts, [...] "she felt as if she had looked up and suddenly seen a whole new planet hanging huge and populous right outside the window, an entirely strange world, one in which the gods did not matter." [...] Ged acts as a catalyst for this stream of thought, because he is completely alien to her; he is male, brown-skinned, and has a picture of the world is so different from Tenar's own. After speaking to him, she begins to wonder whether the Nameless Ones, despite their power, deserve her worship, and begins to lose faith in them and in all the things she has been taught. She expects to find only evil in Ged, according to what she has been taught; but instead she finds light and love, further challenging her belief.|$|E
500|$|The {{novels of}} the Earthsea cycle differ notably from Le Guin's early Hainish cycle works, written {{during the same}} period. Fantasy scholar George Slusser {{described}} them as providing a counterweight to the [...] "excessive pessimism" [...] of the Hainish novels. He saw the former as depicting individual action in a favorable light, in contrast to works such as [...] "Vaster than Empires and More Slow". The trilogy shares a thematic similarity in that each volume a bildungsroman for a different character; the first for Ged, the second for <b>Tenar,</b> and the third for Arren.|$|E
500|$|The Tombs of Atuan {{was well}} {{received}} {{when it was}} published, with critics commenting favorably {{on the character of}} <b>Tenar,</b> Le Guin's writing, and her [...] "sensitive" [...] portrayal of cultural differences between the Kargish people and the people of the rest of Earthsea. The story received praise for its exploration of religious themes and ethical questions. Le Guin's treatment of gender was criticized by several scholars, who stated that she had created a female protagonist, but within a male-dominated framework. Nonetheless, the novel has been described by scholars and commentators as [...] "beautifully written", and a [...] "significant exploration of womanhood".|$|E
500|$|After this incident, {{she falls}} ill and {{experiences}} nightmares, suggesting {{that when she}} underwent the rituals that made her the [...] "eaten one", some of her personality and her regard for life remained. She questions her faith (another theme {{that runs through the}} novel), and begins to develop a sense of self apart from it, helped in this process by Ged. She wrestles with her contradictory thoughts for a long time; keeping Ged alive would be contrary to all her teachings and the powers she serves, but sacrificing him would be contrary to her developing respect for life. An important moment in this process is when Ged calls her by her true name, and clarifies for her the choice between remaining in the Tombs as Arha and embracing <b>Tenar</b> and stepping into the larger world of Earthsea. Afterwards she has a nightmare about suffocating, a motif Cummins describes as being common to female coming-of-age stories.|$|E
500|$|Le Guin {{originally}} intended for A Wizard of Earthsea to be a standalone novel, {{but decided to}} write a sequel after considering the loose ends in the first book, and The Tombs of Atuan was released in 1971. The Farthest Shore was written as a third volume after further consideration, and was published in 1972. The Tombs of Atuan tells {{of the story of}} Ged's attempt to make whole the ring of Erreth Akbe, half of which is buried in the tombs of Atuan in the Kargish lands, from where he must steal it. There, he meets the child priestess <b>Tenar,</b> on whom the book focuses. In The Farthest Shore, Ged, who has become Archmage, tries to combat a dwindling of magic across Earthsea, accompanied by Arren, a young prince. The first three books are together seen as the [...] "original trilogy"; in each of these, Ged is shown as trying to heal some imbalance in the world. They were followed by Tehanu (1990), Tales from Earthsea (2001), and The Other Wind (2001), which are sometimes referred to as the [...] "second trilogy".|$|E
500|$|The {{notion of}} faith and deep belief is a large party of the novel, and {{is related to the}} book's other theme of identity. Throughout the story there is a tension between a faith in the Nameless Ones and their power, and human curiosity and the {{tendency}} to question. The importance of tradition and belief in Kargish culture is emphasized when <b>Tenar</b> is taken from her family, and chosen to be the high priestess of the Tombs. However, Tenar's mother unsuccessfully tries to dupe the priestesses into believing the child has a skin disease. Commentators state that this episode suggests certain universal impulses can lead to resistance against [...] "cultural imperatives"; Tenar's mother is willing to bend the rules to keep her child. Unlike the rest of Earthsea, which relies on the [...] "Old Speech" [...] for its magic and rituals, the Kargish lands use their own tongue, and rituals are conducted with meaningless babble; thus from the moment the chanting of the priestesses is described, Le Guin suggests that the Kargish faith is one of meaningless words and ritual. The Kargish deities are revered as the [...] "Nameless Ones"; thus Ged's statement to Arha that all things have names also works to undermine her faith.|$|E
500|$|The Tombs of Atuan was a Newbery Honor Book in 1972, {{but did not}} win {{any other}} major awards before being a runner-up for the International Children's Literature Association’s Phoenix Award twenty years after its first {{publication}}. Upon its publication British critic Naomi Lewis called it an [...] "extraordinary book", while scholar Andrew Wolk called the series a masterpiece of fantasy. The prose in the novel received praise; a 1996 reference book on science fiction described them as among the best regarded fantasies, {{and went on to}} call the series a [...] "fast-paced narrative" [...] that explored serious questions of morality, power, and identity, Science fiction writer Jo Walton said that it was a [...] "beautifully written" [...] book. She went on to write that a [...] "lesser writer" [...] would have ended the novel after the earthquake and the collapse of the Tombs, but that the last section of the story, about Ged and Tenar's travel, [...] "do a lot to ground it", making it [...] "solid and well rooted as ever". Speculative fiction scholar Mike Cadden praised the characterization in the novel, calling <b>Tenar</b> the [...] "finest and most complicated multiple character in the Earthsea series, and maybe in all of her fiction". However, scholar Sandra Lindow referred to the conclusion of the novel, and particularly the conclusion of Ged and Tenar's relationship, as unsatisfying. A 2016 review in The Huffington Post praised the religious theme in the novel, saying Le Guin [...] "skillfully illustrates the way religious conviction can permeate and give meaning to a life", while Entertainment Weekly referred to it as [...] "a classic of stealth-missile literature, a fantasy adventure that's actually a feminist horror thriller".|$|E
500|$|In Le Guin's fictional universe, to {{know the}} true name of an object or a person is to have power over it. Each child is given a true name when they reach puberty, a name which they share only with close friends. Several of the dragons in the later Earthsea novels, like Orm Embar and Kalessin, are shown as living openly with their names, which do not give anybody power over them. In A Wizard of Earthsea, however, Ged is shown to have power over Yevaud. Cadden writes that this is because Yevaud still has {{attachment}} to riches and material possessions, and is thus bound {{by the power of}} his name. Wizards exert their influence over the equilibrium through the use of names, thus linking this theme to Le Guin's depiction of a cosmic balance. According to Cummins, this is Le Guin's way of demonstrating the power of language in shaping reality. Since language is the tool we use for communicating about the environment, she argues that it also allows humans to affect the environment, and the wizards' power to use names symbolizes this. Cummins went on to draw an analogy between the a wizard's use of names to change things with the creative use of words in fictional writing. Shippey wrote that Earthsea magic seems to work through what he called the [...] "Rumpelstiltskin theory", in which names have power. He argued that this portrayal was part of Le Guin's effort to emphasize the power of words over objects, which, according to Shippey, was in contrast to the ideology of other fantasy writers, such as James Frazer in The Golden Bough. Esmonde argued that each of the first three Earthsea books hinged on an act of trust. In A Wizard of Earthsea, Vetch trusts Ged with his true name when the latter is at his lowest ebb emotionally, thus giving Ged complete power over himself. Ged later offers <b>Tenar</b> the same gift in The Tombs of Atuan, thereby allowing her to learn trust.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S.-based Sci Fi Channel {{broadcast}} in December 2004 a three-hour loose adaptation for television of A Wizard of Earthsea and The Tombs of Atuan, entitled Legend of Earthsea (later, simply Earthsea). It was {{broadcast in}} two parts on Channel 4 in the UK at Easter 2005. Sci Fi Channel had angered Le Guin and fans of the Earthsea novels with its announcement that Ged {{and the vast majority}} of the other characters would be played by Caucasians and with the dramatis personæ posted on an official website. The latter revealed several original characters – such as [...] "The Archmagus" [...] and [...] "King Tygath", [...] "Diana", [...] "Penelope", and [...] "Marion" [...] – and it referred to [...] "Kargide" [...] characters rather than Kargad, Karg, or Kargish. The religious practices of Atuan were portrayed differently in the adaptation, and the celibacy of Earthsea wizards overlooked as Ged and <b>Tenar</b> become sexually involved.|$|E
50|$|In the labyrinth, Ged {{is locked}} in the cell next to <b>Tenar.</b> They break free and {{recognize}} each other from their visions. Thar realizes her mistake right before her death. Kossil tries to force <b>Tenar</b> to reveal the incantation and fails, so Tygath kills Kossil and follows <b>Tenar</b> to {{the gate of the}} Nameless Ones.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Thar {{appoints}} a successor, <b>Tenar,</b> {{and tells}} her the incantation {{to release the}} Nameless Ones. Kossil strangles Rosa and frames <b>Tenar,</b> leading to her imprisonment.|$|E
5000|$|The Posleen {{are broken}} up into two {{distinct}} elements, the 'Normals' and the 'God Kings'. While these share similar physical characteristics (resistance to {{biological and chemical}} weapons, highly efficient metabolisms, armored body structures etc.), the 'God Kings' are also blessed with enhanced intelligence that makes them the leaders of their less intelligent brethren, {{as well as a}} crest on their necks that expands like certain lizards. In battle, God Kings ride on personal fighting vehicles called <b>Tenar,</b> which are not only heavily armed (usually with plasma cannons and hypervelocity missiles) but also contain communications equipment, a sensor array and tactical displays. The quality of <b>Tenar</b> and their systems varies due to personal preference on the part of their owners and on their owner's wealth. <b>Tenar</b> resemble flying saucers and use anti-grav technology to fly; they can not only hover close to the ground but fly at significant altitudes. A <b>tenar</b> can sense and track isolated weapons fire and respond automatically making it very dangerous to snipe a God King; however, once a certain amount of weapons fire is present in the environment, the [...] "noise" [...] keeps the <b>tenar</b> from being able to keep track and can no longer identify specific threats. However, even in this case, <b>tenar</b> have anti-air capabilities that make conventional aircraft useless. Flying anything from a helicopter to an F-22 in the line of sight of a <b>Tenar</b> is suicide and hugging the ground just leaves an aircraft open to mass fire from the normals. <b>Tenar</b> are durable but contain very volatile energy cores, which explode quite powerfully when pierced, usually killing many nearby normals and potentially other <b>tenar</b> as well. In addition to his <b>Tenar,</b> many God Kings carry swords with mono-molecular blades. A God King will lead a [...] "fief" [...] of several hundred normals whom he essentially owns, he is also responsible for outfitting them at his own expense. God Kings get their starts by working for a higher ranking God King who will set them up with a simple <b>tenar</b> and a small and barely equipped fief in return for subservience. In the novel Yellow Eyes, it is shown that they lack skill in dealing with certain unreasonable Terran problems (i.e. soldier ant swarms and other deep jungle hazards).|$|E
