25|$|To be virulent, the {{bacterium}} must contain a tumour-inducing plasmid (<b>Ti</b> <b>plasmid</b> or pTi), of 200 kb, which contains the T-DNA {{and all the}} genes necessary to transfer it to the plant cell. Many strains of A. tumefaciens do not contain a pTi.|$|E
25|$|The {{conjugation}} {{machinery of}} some bacteria (and archaeal flagella) {{is capable of}} transporting both DNA and proteins. It was discovered in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which uses this system to introduce the <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmid</b> and proteins into the host, which develops the crown gall (tumor). The VirB complex of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the prototypic system.|$|E
25|$|Since the <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmid</b> is {{essential}} to cause disease, prepenetration events in the rhizosphere occur to promote bacterial conjugation - exchange of plasmids amongst bacteria. In the presence of opines, A. tumefaciens produces a diffusible conjugation signal called 30C8HSL or the Agrobacterium autoinducer. This activates the transcription factor TraR, positively regulating the transcription of genes required for conjugation.|$|E

Its T-DNA transfer {{system as well}} as those of <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmids</b> have successfully provided the fundamental technique to introduce exogenous genes into plants. To study the Ri genome structure, we constructed a complete BamHI physical map and a lambda library of pRil 724 of A. rhizogenes strain 1724. By using these, we carried out the complete sequence of the 74 -kb region between the right border of T-DNA and tra operon, which is the highly variable region (VAR) among Ri and <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmids.</b> As a result, we found three kinds of putative ABC-type transport operons, histidine utilization operon, glycerol utilization operon and two chemoreceptor genes.

25|$|Mahyco {{licensed}} {{and used}} the cry1Ac gene obtained from Monsanto and two supporting genes (nptII and aad). The cry1Ac gene is under the transcriptional control of an enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter, which ensures the gene is expressed in all the brinjal's tissue throughout its complete life cycle. NptII and aad are selectable marker genes, nptII is used to identify transgenic plants from non-transgenic, and aad is used to identify the transformed bacteria used during {{the development of the}} construct. Aad contains a bacterial promoter and is not expressed in the Bt brinjal. The completed construct was inserted into young cotyledons from the brinjal plants using an Agrobacterium-mediated technique. Agrobacterium naturally inserts DNA into plants from its <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmid,</b> and scientists use this to insert genes of interest into various plants. The transformed plants were regenerated and analyzed for the presence of the gene through Southern blotting. The plants' progeny were also analyzed to identify lines segregating in a Mendelian fashion.|$|E
25|$|Transformation using {{electroporation}} {{was developed}} in the late 1980s, increasing the efficiency of in-vitro transformation and increasing the number of bacterial strains that could be transformed. Transformation of animal and plant cells was also investigated with the first transgenic mouse being created by injecting a gene for a rat growth hormone into a mouse embryo in 1982. In 1907 a bacterium that caused plant tumors, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, was discovered and in the early 1970s the tumor-inducing agent was found to be a DNA plasmid called the <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmid.</b> By removing the genes in the plasmid that caused the tumor and adding in novel genes, researchers were able to infect plants with A. tumefaciens and let the bacteria insert their chosen DNA into the genomes of the plants. Not all plant cells are susceptible to infection by A. tumefaciens, so other methods were developed, including electroporation and micro-injection. Particle bombardment was made possible with the invention of the Biolistic Particle Delivery System (gene gun) by John Sanford in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmid</b> is {{responsible}} for transmission of crown gall disease in plants infected with A. vitis. Tumorigenic A. vitis transfers its <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmid</b> to other bacteria, and transfers T-DNA into plants. Virulence genes encoded by the <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmid</b> generate single-strand T-DNA molecules, which in turn are transferred to healthy hosts. Disorganized cell division occurs in infected hosts, leading to gall development instead {{of the formation of}} healthy vascular tissue.|$|E
40|$|The {{vir genes}} of octopine, nopaline, and l,l-succinamopine <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmids</b> exhibit {{structural}} and functional similarities. However, we observed {{differences in the}} interactions between octopine and nopaline vir components. The induction of an octopine virEA 6 ::lacZ fusion (pSM 358 cd) was 2. 3 -fold higher in an octopine strain (A 348) than in a nopaline strain (C 58). Supplementation of the octopine virGA 6 in a nopaline strain with pSM 358 did not completely restore virEA 6 induction. However, addition of the octopine virAA 6 to the above strain increased virEA 6 induction to a level almost comparable to that in octopine strains. In a reciprocal analysis, the induction of a nopaline virEC 58 ::cat fusion (pUCD 1553) was two- to threefold higher in nopaline (C 58 and T 37) strains than in octopine (A 348 and Ach 5) and l,l-succinamopine (A 281) strains. Supplementation of nopaline virAC 58 and virGC 58 in an octopine strain (A 348) harboring pUCD 1553 increased induction levels of virEC 58 ::cat fusion to a level comparable {{to that in a}} nopaline strain (C 58). Our results suggest that octopine and l,l-succinamopine VirG proteins induce the octopine virEA 6 more efficiently than they do the nopaline virEC 58. Conversely, the nopaline VirG protein induces the nopaline virEC 58 more efficiently than it does the octopine virEA 6. The ability of Bo 542 virG to bring about supervirulence in tobacco is observed for an octopine vir helper (LBA 4404) but not for a nopaline vir helper (PMP 90). Our analyses reveal that quantitative differences exist in the interactions between VirG and vir boxes of different <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmids.</b> Efficient vir gene induction in octopine and nopaline strains requires virA, virG, and vir boxes from the respective <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmids...</b>|$|R
40|$|The plant {{pathogen}} Agrobacterium tumefaciensC 58 harbours three independent type IV secretion (T 4 SS) machineries. T 4 SS(T-DNA) promotes {{the transfer of}} the T-DNA to host plant cells, provoking tumour development and accumulation of opines such as nopaline and agrocinopines. T 4 SS(pTi) and T 4 SS(pAt) control the bacterial conjugation of the <b>Ti</b> and At <b>plasmids</b> respectively. Expression of T 4 SS(pTi) is controlled by the agrocinopine-responsive transcriptional repressor AccR. In this work, we compared the genome-wide transcriptional profile of the wild-type A. tumefaciens strain C 58 with that of its accR KO-mutant to delineate the AccR regulon. In addition to the genes that encode agrocinopine catabolism and T 4 SS(pTi), we found that AccR also regulated genes coding for nopaline catabolism and T 4 SS(pAt). Further opine detection and conjugation assays confirmed the enhancement of nopaline consumption and At plasmid conjugation frequency in accR. Moreover, co-regulation of the T 4 SS(pTi) and T 4 SS(pAt) correlated with the co-transfer of the At and <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmids</b> both in vitro and in plant tumours. Finally, unlike T 4 SS(pTi), T 4 SS(pAt) activation does not require quorum-sensing. Overall this study highlights the regulatory interplays between opines, At and <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmids</b> that contribute to a concerted dissemination of the two replicons in bacterial populations colonizing the plant tumour...|$|R
40|$|Gene 4 {{from the}} T-region of <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmids</b> is {{responsible}} for cytokinin effects in crown gall cells; we investigated whether it codes for an enzyme of hormone biosynthesis. In a first set of experiments, gene 4 from octopine plasmid pTiAch 5 and nopaline plasmid pTiC 58 was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the gene products were identified by reaction with antiserum raised against a decapeptide derived from the DNA sequence of the gene. Extracts from cells expressing the gene contained high isopentenyl-transferase activity catalyzing the formation of N 6 -(△ 2 -isopentenyl) adenosine from 5 '-AMP and △ 2 -isopentenylpyrophosphate. The cytokinin was identified by sequential h. p. l. c. chromatography and mass spectrometry. In {{a second set of}} experiments it was shown that crown gall cells contained isopentenyltransferase activity and a protein of mol. wt. 27 000 which was identified as the product of gene 4 by reaction with the antiserum. Isopentenyltransferase activity was specifically inhibited by the antiserum. No comparable enzyme activity or immunoreactive protein was detected in cytokinin-autotrophic, T-DNA free tobacco cells.

40|$|TraF, an {{essential}} component of the conjugative transfer apparatus of the broad-host-range plasmid RP 4 (IncP), which is located at the periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane, encodes a specific protease. The traF gene products of IncP and <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmids</b> show extensive similarities to prokaryotic and eukaryotic signal peptidases. Mutational analysis of RP 4 TraF revealed that the mechanism of the proteolytic cleavage reaction resembles that of signal and LexA-like peptidases. Among the RP 4 transfer functions, the product of the Tra 2 gene, trbC, was identified as a target for the TraF protease activity. TrbC is homologous to VirB 2 of <b>Ti</b> <b>plasmids</b> and thought to encode the RP 4 prepilin. The maturation of TrbC involves three processing reactions: (i) the removal of the N-terminal signal peptide by Escherichia coli signal peptidase I (Lep), (ii) a proteolytic cleavage at the C terminus by an as yet unidentified host cell enzyme, and (iii) C-terminal processing by TraF. The third reaction of the maturation process is critical for conjugative transfer, pilus synthesis, and the propagation of the donor-specific bacteriophage PRD 1.
