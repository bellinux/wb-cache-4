His success in dealing with a manuscript that, having been over-written with other works of Ephrem the Syrian, had been mostly illegible to earlier collators, made him more well known, and gained support for more extended critical expeditions. He now became professor extraordinarius at Leipzig, and became married in 1845. He also began to publish Reise in den Orient, an account of his travels in the east (in 2 vols., 1845-46, translated as Travels in the East in 1847). Even though he was an expert in reading the text of a palimpsest (<b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>document</b> where the original writing has been removed and new writing added), {{he was not able}} to identify the value or meaning of the [...] "Archemedes Palimpsest", which he donated to Cambridge.|$|E
50|$|Aggregate reporting, {{also known}} as {{periodic}} reporting, {{plays a key role}} in the safety assessment of drugs. Aggregate reporting involves the compilation of safety data for a drug over a prolonged period of time (months or years), as opposed to single-case reporting which, by definition, involves only individual AE reports. The advantage of aggregate reporting is that it provides a broader view of the safety profile of a drug. Worldwide, the most important aggregate report is the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) and Development safety updated report (DSUR). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>document</b> that is submitted to drug regulatory agencies in Europe, the US and Japan (ICH countries), as well as other countries around the world. The PSUR was updated in 2012 and is now referred to in many countries as the Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation report (PBRER). As the title suggests, the PBRER's focus is on the benefit-risk profile of the drug, which includes a review of relevant safety data compiled for a drug product since its development.|$|E
5000|$|If a {{child or}} young person's parent(s) or {{educational}} setting believe {{that his or her}} needs cannot be met by the school's resources they can apply to their local authority to carry out a Statutory Assessment of Special Educational Needs. If this is agreed the Statutory Assessment can lead to a Statement of Special Educational Needs. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>document</b> which summarises the child or young person's needs; what learning objectives need to be addressed and what provision is necessary to achieve this. The local authority is responsible for the provision on the Statement and will provide funding and advice to the educational setting to ensure this happens. The number of children with Statements of SEN often varies according to location due to the different arrangements for supporting SEN in each authority. However the criteria for whether a statutory assessment is necessary are national and described in the 2001 SEN Revised Code of Practice. and parents have a right to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (formerly the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities Tribunal) if they do not agree with the local authority's decision. In most cases it is considered appropriate for children with statements of SEN to be educated in their local mainstream school with additional support. However it may be agreed that some children or young people with very significant needs will have their needs better met in a special school.|$|E

50|$|According to the Rocznik Traski (based {{probably}} in older sources now missing), on 28 September 1284, Kalisz was burned. This soon caused {{a series of}} events which threatened the power of Przemysł II. Now governor of Kalisz and in the city {{at the time of the}} fire, Sędziwój Zaremba, fearing the consequences, decided to take the Kalisz castle (apparently not damaged in the fire) and give it to Henry IV Probus. At the news of the events of Kalisz, Przemysł II reacted instantly. No later than 6 October, as attested by a document issued in that time, Przemysł II was at the head of the Greater Poland knights under the city walls. In view of the refusal of submission, the duke ordered the siege. It is unknown how prolonged this siege was, but certainly soon due to the reluctance to fight from the rebels (knights and nobles probably feared that Przemysł II, after the capture of the castle, would not spare nobody), the duke agreed to negotiate with them. Eventually, Przemysł II regained his castle of Kalisz, but he had to give the newly built castle in Ołobok to Henryk IV Probus. There is no certainty that the betrayal of Sędziwój Zaremba was an isolated incident or part of a wider conspiracy from the Zaremba family. However, it can be assumed that the duke didn't believe in a familiar conspiracy because most of Sędziwój's relatives remained in their posts even after 1284. Another source supporting <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>document</b> issued on 6 October (and thus during the period of siege) where the voivode of Poznań Beniamin Zaremba appears as a witness, and therefore had to remain in the inner circle of Przemysł II.|$|E
50|$|About 600, the lordship of Medard {{was split}} from the royal {{holdings}} and {{donated to the}} Bishopric of Verdun. In 843 came the Treaty of Verdun, which divided the Frankish Realm into three states. Ginsweiler was grouped into the Kingdom of the East Franks. From roughly 750 to 1140, spanning both the eras, before and after Verdun, the local area belonged to the Nahegau Counts. Splitting away from them about 1127 was the County of Veldenz, under whose protection were mostly ecclesiastical lands, for instance lands held by the Bishopric of Verdun around Baumholder and Medard and the Remigiusland, a domain held by the Archbishopric of Reims. In 1327, the Counts of Veldenz also bought the lordship of Medard. Ginsweiler, too, lay within the new County of Veldenz and later, comital vassals were time and again enfeoffed with the whole village or part of it. The ﬁrst indication that history has of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>document</b> from 1379, wherein the knight Sir Mohr of Sötern (nowadays a constituent community of Nohfelden) conﬁrmed {{that he had been}} enfeoffed by the gracious Junker Friedrich, Count of Veldenz, with holdings in the villages of Heinzenhausen, Lohnweiler, Lauterecken, Medard, Roth, Schwanden (vanished village near Medard), Obersulzbach, Niedersulzbach, Ginsweiler, Mannweiler (vanished village), Adenbach and Odenbach, and in the outlying countryside around Meisenheim. For Ginsweiler, Mannweiler, Adenbach and the two Sulzbachs (nowadays Sulzbachtal), this was a ﬁrst documentary mention. Nevertheless, Pöhlmann rather assumed that the Gundeswilre mentioned in the document referred to Gumbsweiler (nowadays a constituent community of Sankt Julian), not Ginsweiler. Before these holdings were once more granted as fiefs, according to Alfred Wendel, the Knights of Odenbach had supposedly been the ﬁefholders. “Junker Friedrich” was Count Friedrich II of the cadet line of the Counts of Veldenz. In a 1380 itemization, a knight named Gerhard von Alsenz likewise acknowledged an enfeoffment from Count Friedrich II, conﬁrming that he held a share in Castle Odenbach, and also received interest from various villages, namely Ginsweiler, Mannweiler and Adenbach. The ﬁefs named herein later passed at some unknown point in time to the Lords of Allenbach (Ellenbach). The village of Ginsweiler belonged then to the Unteramt of Odenbach. The last Count of Veldenz, Friedrich III, died in 1444 without a son to inherit the county. His daughter Anna was married to Count Palatine Stephan, a son of the King and Elector of the Palatinate, Ruprecht. Combining his own Palatine holdings and his wife’s inheritance, Stephan now created the County Palatine of Zweibrücken, which in the fullness of time {{came to be known as}} the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken. For the time being, the town of Meisenheim remained the residence town, but it was moved to Zweibrücken in 1477.|$|E
