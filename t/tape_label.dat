2500|$|The {{first version}} of the game was {{released}} for the BBC Micro, model B on tape and disk and [...] "about {{a month or two}} later" [...] the Acorn Electron tape version was released. [...] The Electron's limitations meant several game features were cut including Thargoids and suns. Neither the BBC nor the Electron tape versions featured missions. [...] Additionally, the original tape version for the Electron contained a bug that stopped Galactic Hyperspace from working. Acorn provided a mail-in tape-replacement service to upgrade to v1.1 (marked as such on the <b>tape</b> <b>label)</b> that fixed this bug. The BBC B disk version, referred to as Classic Elite, would load a new set of ships after every hyperspace jump or space station launch, meaning a larger number of ships were available. A new disk version released by Superior Software in 1986 was enhanced {{to take advantage of the}} BBC Micro Model B's successors including the BBC Micro Model B+, Master 128 computers, the optional 6502 Second Processor or sideways RAM, if they were fitted. In this case, the game used Modes 1 and 2 to make more colours available.|$|E
