At the same time, Vojvodina requested that Croatia return the territories on the right bank of the Danube that had previously been ceded to it (Varoš-Viza and Mala Siga). While in the Yugoslav framework, the issue received little further attention as its resolution was discouraged by the federal authorities, and because the area involved had limited economic value, was uninhabited and frequently flooded.|$|E

Tus, acting as the Chief of the General Staff, ordered the clandestine killing of extremists before they caused mass killing of civilians or great material damage. According to Tus, this order was based on an assessment that there were extremist JNA officers present in Bjelovar, intent on carrying out such acts.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to rethink <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> <b>in</b> {{education}} tentatively. For this purpose, this article pays attention to a conception called "rational authority", which was presented by Erich Fromm (1900 - 80), who was famous sociopsychologist in the 20 ^th century. Many studies of pedagogy or educational science have emphasized the need of <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> <b>in</b> education. But most of them tend to discuss a desirable quantity of <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> and do not fully have qualitative discrimination of <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> <b>in</b> educational fields. However, Erich Fromm 2 ̆ 7 s thoughts on authority seem to have potentiality for that qualitative discrimination. According to Fromm 2 ̆ 7 s early texts, especially in Escape from Freedom (1941) and Man for Himself (1947), "rational authority" have four characteristics. That is, 1) "rational authority" is ruled by the elements of love, admiration and gratitude, 2) it can become the model of the identification generally or partially, 3) <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> has its source in competence, and 4) it is always temporary. It is certain that these characteristics are rather abstractive, but in considering works of his latter period, the dynamics between "rational authority" and "inhibiting authority" is suggested. This dynamism hints for the possibility of rethinking of <b>the</b> <b>authority</b> <b>in</b> educatio...|$|R
5|$|Hindman's edicts, however, {{raised the}} ire of the local citizenry, and his {{political}} enemies demanded that the Confederate leaders in Richmond replace him. By August 1862, <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>in</b> Richmond decided to replace him with the well-meaning but incompetent Theophilus H. Holmes. Hindman convinced Holmes {{to give him a}} field command in northern Arkansas, and he proceeded with a plan to drive out the invader. Hindman aggressively moved into northwest Arkansas and managed to intercept the Federal army while it was divided into two parts. At this moment, however, Hindman's normally aggressive style gave way to uncharacteristic doubt. Rather than attack the divided pieces of the Federal army, Hindman entrenched himself at Prairie Grove, Arkansas, allowing the Federal forces to recombine and assault him.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Vojvodina's Ministry of Agriculture {{complained to}} Serbia's Ministry of Forestry that <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>in</b> Vukovar refused {{to hand over}} four river islands, and then to Croatia's Ministry of Forestry {{regarding}} the same matter, asking for assistance. After Croatia refused the request, the Serbian authorities turned to the federal government. The federal authorities advised resolving the matter through mutual agreement and said that Vojvodina's interpretation of the law on its borders—that the border runs along thalweg of the Danube valley, i.e. along the river's midpoint—is erroneous because {{the law does not}} apply such wording. In a letter dated 18 April 1947, Yugoslav authorities said that the disputed river islands were the territory of Vukovar district and that the territory could not be transferred to Vojvodina before the border was defined otherwise.|$|E
5|$|In July 1545, the French {{carried out}} a raid at nearby Seaford, and the castle may have seen action against the French fleet.

Complaints were made to Parliament about the situation in 1548, and <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>in</b> Rye expressed fears in 1573 that the Camber was damaged beyond repair. By the end of the century, the reclamation of the surrounding marshes and the dumping of ballast by passing ships had accelerated the natural processes and the anchorage was ruined. The surrounding region was also less strategically important than it had once been: towns like Winchelsea and Rye were in decline, peace had been made with France in 1558 and military attention shifted towards the Spanish threat to the south-west of England.|$|E

5|$|Local rebel commanders were {{generally}} suspicious of outside Arab military leaders, such as al-Qawuqji, {{and of the}} AHC, particularly after {{many members of the}} latter joined the Damascus-based Central Committee of Jihad following the AHC's dissolution by <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>in</b> October 1937. The Central Committee had been founded in late 1937 by Izzat Darwaza, and officially served as the revolt's political leadership, fundraising body and arms supplier. On the ground in Palestine, competition for the role of the rebels' general command became increasingly tense between al-Hajj Muhammad and Abd al-Raziq. They engaged in a serious rivalry, which coincided with acrimonious relations between their families over influence in the Tulkarm area's social and political spheres.|$|E
5|$|Major-General Charles George Gordon {{was given}} the job of {{evacuating}} the Egyptian garrison from Khartoum. He arrived on 18 February 1884. Gordon was reluctant to abandon the population of Khartoum to {{the forces of the}} Mahdi, and also felt that by evacuating the city he would open the way for the Mahdi to threaten Egypt. He bombarded <b>the</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>in</b> Cairo with telegrams suggesting alternative courses, and delayed starting the evacuation. On 13 March 1884 the tribes north of Khartoum declared for the Mahdi, cutting the telegraph and blocking river traffic. Khartoum was besieged, falling on 25 January 1885 after a siege of 313 days. A relief column arrived two days after the city had fallen and Gordon had been killed. Despite a short-lived public outcry in Britain over Gordon's death, Britain took no further action in Sudan for several years.|$|E

The Assaf realm dissipated in 1591 when Muhammad was killed while attempting to collect taxes from the Sayfas in Akkar.
