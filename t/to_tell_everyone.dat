5|$|At the hospital, Natasha blames Andrew for the crash. She learns Ed has a {{fractured}} collarbone and sits with {{him until he}} wakes up. When he does, Natasha kisses him. They begin dating, but Natasha worries {{that they do not}} have much in common. Natasha helps organise a ball for the university and takes an immediate dislike to Ed's vintage suit. She spills coffee on it and then lends Ed a nicer one that she found. Ed realises what she has done and they fight. After apologising to each other, Natasha decides to break up with Ed, as they are too different. When Natasha finds Andrew having a fit in Charlie's, she learns that he has epilepsy. She agrees to keep it a secret. After he collapses, Natasha encourages Andrew to go to the hospital for tests. Before he can leave, he suffers a fit in front of Paul. Andrew initially blames Natasha for causing the fit when Paul takes Charlie's away from him. She then helps him to convince Paul to change his mind. Natasha and Andrew begin dating again in secret. They later decide <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everyone</b> and Summer reveals that she already knew and does not mind. Natasha later finds an old email from Andrew proclaiming his love for Summer and she begins to worry about her relationship with him. However, Andrew reassures her that he loves her and their relationship is different this time around. Natasha asks Andrew to take a month of celibacy, but they end up breaking it early.

25|$|That night, {{the people}} of Storybrooke are all celebrating at Granny's diner. Lily tells Emma {{that she wants to}} find the {{identity}} of her father and plans on staying in Storybrooke during her search. Belle shows up <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everyone</b> that the last bit of humanity in Gold's heart is about to be consumed by the Darkness, and the group finds Gold unconscious in his shop. The Apprentice then removes Gold's nearly-black heart from his chest, and uses his power to pull the Darkness out of Gold's heart and transfer it into the Sorcerer’s Hat, which severs Gold's link to the Dagger of Kris in the process. He then puts a pure white heart back into Gold, and casts a preservation spell on Gold, to keep him alive while they figure out how to help him recover. However, the hat is unable to contain the Darkness, and it breaks out, before attacking and entering the Apprentice. Emma uses her light magic to force the Darkness back out of the Apprentice, and the Darkness exits the shop. As the Apprentice lies dying, he tells Emma and Hook that, long ago, centuries before their births, the Sorcerer battled the Darkness and tethered it to a human soul with the Dark One's Dagger, and now that it's free, the only person who can prevent the Darkness from destroying all the realms is the Sorcerer himself: Merlin.|$|E
25|$|Mark {{takes over}} running the family fruit and {{vegetable}} stall in the market after his uncle, Pete Beale (Peter Dean), leaves. He also begins casually dating his sister's housemate Shelley Lewis (Nicole Arumugam), but is reluctant {{to tell her about}} his HIV status. Whilst on a trip to Amsterdam, Shelley makes it clear to Mark that she wants to sleep with him, forcing him to admit his HIV status. Shelley is furious that he did not think to tell her this before and tells him she never wants to see him again. Mark takes the rejection badly and stops taking his HIV medication. During Christmas that year, he is rushed to hospital after collapsing. When Shelley finds out that Mark is ill, she returns and admits that she really cares for him and they reconcile. However, Shelley tries to rush things by asking Mark to meet her family and go on holiday with her parents. She becomes infatuated and tries to spend as much time with him as she can. Mark fears that the relationship is moving too quickly and Mark decides to end it. When he tries to tell Shelley this, she uses emotional blackmail to stop him, saying that she has risked her health being with him so he owes her.

500|$|The {{proposal}} surprised Naomi, as {{they had}} only been dating for a few months, but she [...] "feels duty bound" [...] to accept. Naomi instantly had second thoughts and when Paul wanted <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everyone,</b> {{in the hope that}} it might boost his mayoral position, she asked him to keep their engagement a secret. Naomi and Paul's relationship eventually ended after she had a one-night stand with Josh.

With no food or adult supervision, the children rely on snack food retrieved from the sunken bus by Bart. They awake the next morning to find the snacks all gone.

On returning to the UK, Nicholson confirmed that he would leave Arctic Monkeys and start his own project.

500|$|In early 2015, Sharon {{is framed}} and arrested {{for the murders}} of Austin Travers (Matthew Atkinson) and Noah's fiancée Courtney Sloane (Kelli Goss), but acquitted {{due to lack of}} evidence. During this period, Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton) becomes her confidant and the two start a romantic relationship.

500|$|Mirroring the {{deliberately}} vague detail {{within the}} novel, the blurb {{on the book}} is unusually written, in {{that it does not}} name the characters or reveal the plot. It was written by a team at Sceptre led by marketing consultant Damian Horner, and has the approval of Cleave, who described it as [...] "genius". Cleave explained: [...] "I think readers are quite smart and don't really need the whole thing spelt out for them in a plot summary. It's nice to let them discover the book at their own speed. And the technique of the book is to release these dirty secrets gradually." [...] The content of the blurb varies between UK and American editions of the novel, but both begin: [...] "We don't want to tell you too much about this book. It is a truly special story and we don't want to spoil it." [...] and end: [...] "Once you have read it, you'll want <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everyone</b> about it. When you do, please don't tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds." [...] James Spackman, Sales and Marketing Director for Sceptre, was initially sceptical of the blurb, particularly disliking the use of [...] "we" [...] for the publisher to address the reader directly. Once the book became a best-seller, however, he revised his stance, and now believes that the reason the blurb works is because it makes a virtue of denying the reader information, with an unusual format and [...] "arrestingly direct" [...] tone. The blurb won Sceptre the [...] "Best Blurb" [...] award at the 2010 Book Marketing Society Awards.|$|E
2500|$|In an October {{election}} {{debate with}} Tester, regarding the Iraq War, Burns said that Tester [...] "says our president doesn't have a plan. I think he's got one. He's not going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everyone</b> in the world", and later told Tester, [...] "We're {{not going to}} tell you what our plan is, Jon, because you're just going to go out and blow it." [...] These comments were likened by critics to then presidential candidate Richard Nixon's unfulfilled 1968 promise of a [...] "secret plan" [...] to end the war in Vietnam. Burns was also hurt politically when he confronted a U.S. Forest Service Hotshot Crew from Virginia at an airport about a fire.|$|E

2500|$|When {{financial}} problems began with PokerSpot, players who called PokerSpot customer support requesting withdrawal of their deposited funds were told many different stories, {{ranging from a}} 30-business-day hold to a promise that their checks were [...] "already in the mail." [...] In an online newsgroup in November 2002, Boyd admitted that players had been deceived. Boyd stated that he told his Customer Support staff to, [...] "... spin {{it so that the}} players don't feel the need to make a mad rush on the cardroom OR the need <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everyone</b> they know that PokerSpot [...] going to hell in a handbasket.

As she dies, Nico quotes to Apex [...] "People like <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>everyone</b> dies alone. I always thought that was a poetic way of saying mortality is inevitable. Or death is scary. But I'm calm now. I can't feel anything but the cold. This is the end. And right at the moment...it's not the dying that keeps me dragging myself through the snow. It's the alone."

The Merry Little Breezes had been greatly excited. They couldn't {{understand}} how a stranger could have been living in the Green Forest without their knowledge. You see, they quite forgot that they very seldom wandered to the deepest part of the Green Forest. Of course they started at once, {{as fast as they could}} go, to tell all the other little people who live on or around the Green Meadows, all but Old Man Coyote. For some reason they thought it best not to tell him. They were a little doubtful about Old Man Coyote. He was so big and strong and so sly and smart that all his neighbors were afraid of him. Perhaps the Merry Little Breezes had this fact in mind, and knew that none would dare go to call on the stranger if they knew that Old Man Coyote was going too. Anyway, they simply passed the time of day with Old Mr. Coyote and hurried on <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everyone</b> else, and the very last one they met was Sammy Jay.|$|E
