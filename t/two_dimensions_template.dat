40|$|The one {{dimension}} Legendre wavelets is a numerical method for solving {{one dimension}} variational problems and integral equations. In this paper we introduce <b>two</b> <b>dimensions</b> Legendre wavelets. These wavelets are defined over the interval [0, 1] × [0, 1] and an orthonormal set over this inter-val. The {{integration of the}} product of <b>two</b> <b>dimensions</b> Legendre wavelets over [0, 1] × [0, 1] is equal one. In the paper section we compute operational ma-trices of integration for <b>two</b> <b>dimensions</b> Legendre wavelets.

25|$|This third matrix then {{corresponds}} to a rotation both by 45° (in the first <b>two</b> <b>dimensions)</b> and by 135° (in the last two). Projecting a slab of hypercubes along the first <b>two</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the new coordinates produces an Ammann–Beenker tiling (another such tiling is produced by projecting along the last <b>two</b> <b>dimensions),</b> which therefore also has 8-fold rotational symmetry on average.|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} design {{equations}} available for calculating the torsional compliance and maximum torsion stress of a rectangular cross-section beam. However, before using these equations, {{one of the}} <b>two</b> <b>dimensions</b> (i.e., the thickness and the width) of the cross-section must {{be defined as the}} wider of the <b>two</b> <b>dimensions</b> [17]. This situation might be troublesome and error-prone during the design phase because we always do not know which dimension is larger in advance. This is especially true for an optimization design process considering that the <b>two</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the torsion beam(s) may change greatly during the design iteration process including the relative size of the <b>two</b> <b>dimensions.</b> In our previous work [17], general compliance equations that are symmetric with respect to the <b>two</b> <b>dimensions</b> were obtained to facilitate the design of torsional beams in compliant mechanisms. These equations had been used in characterizing parasitic motions of compliant mechanisms [18, 19] and spatial deflections modeling [20 – 22]. However, there still lacks an equation for predicting the maximum stress in torsional beams that is symmetric with respect to the <b>two</b> <b>dimensions.</b>|$|R

The result shows that diversity and the extent of utilizationhave apositive influence onthe end-users computing satisfaction. While, the diversityof utilization have a positive relationship with task vatiability, and then the extent of utilization have a negative relationship with task analyzability. And the test of interaction ffict between <b>two</b> <b>dimensions</b> of utilitzation and two dimenstons of task uncertainty have not significantly influence on the end-users satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|We first review {{research}} that has identified <b>two</b> fundamental <b>dimensions</b> of social perception. Having defined these <b>two</b> <b>dimensions,</b> we then present {{the results of a}} research program conducted to explore the relationship between them. In general, using both experimental and correlational data, we find evidence of a compensation effect between the <b>two</b> <b>dimensions</b> when <b>two</b> targets are compared. That is, when one target is judged more positively on one of the <b>two</b> fundamental <b>dimensions,</b> the second is judged more positively on the other dimension. We show that this compensation effect is confined to these <b>two</b> fundamental <b>dimensions</b> rather than something that more broadly characterises comparative judgements on any <b>two</b> judgemental <b>dimensions.</b> We then explore the importance of this compensation effect for the formation, maintenance, confirmation, and communication of mixed stereotypes of social groups...|$|R
