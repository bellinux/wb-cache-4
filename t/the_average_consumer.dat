40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of a responsible multinational firm's decision to enter {{in a foreign country}} either through exports or through foreign direct investment (FDI), as well as the relevant market and societal outcomes. We find that CSR investments are higher under FDI than under exports. The multinational firm's incentives to serve the foreign country through FDI are increasing in <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>consumer's</b> valuation for CSR and in the intensity of the foreign country's market competition, but only if <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>consumer's</b> valuation for CSR in this country is sufficiently high. These incentives are mitigated by the multinational firm's liability in this country under exports. We also find that there is misalignment of preferences between the stakeholders of the two countries over the multinational firm's mode of entry in the foreign country...|$|R

The Combo disc is a dual sided disc with one side DVD and the other HD DVD, each of which can have up to two layers. The Twin disc is a single sided disc that can have up to three layers, with up to two layers dedicated to either DVD or HD DVD. These hybrid discs make retail marketing and shelf space management easier. Another advantage is hardware cross-compatibility. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>consumer</b> does {{not have to worry about}} whether or not they can play a hybrid DVD: any standard home DVD player can access the DVD-encoded content and any HD DVD player can access both the DVD- and HD DVD-encoded content.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{alternative}} to using BlackBerry Enterprise Server {{is to use}} the BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS). BlackBerry Internet Service is available in 91 countries internationally. BlackBerry Internet Service was developed primarily for <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>consumer</b> rather than for the business consumer. The service allows users to access POP3, IMAP, and Outlook Web App (not via Exchange ActiveSync) email accounts without connecting through a BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES). BlackBerry Internet Service allows up to 10 email accounts to be accessed, including proprietary as well as public email accounts (such as Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo and AOL). BlackBerry Internet Service also supports the push capabilities of various other BlackBerry Applications. Various applications developed by RIM for BlackBerry utilise the push capabilities of BIS, such as the Instant Messaging clients (like Google Talk, Windows Live Messenger and Yahoo Messenger). The MMS, PIN, interactive gaming, mapping and trading applications require data plans like BIS (not just Wi-Fi) for use. The service is usually provisioned through a mobile phone service provider, though BlackBerry actually runs the service.|$|E

Despite his praise of the design, Gramm condemned the Mint's approach to marketing the coin, stating that if the United States Mint were the Franklin Mint, they would be [...] "sued for deceptive advertisement." [...] He also noted his belief that the Mint had repeated the earlier mistakes of the Susan B.

Hutchison felt that the new coin lacked the necessary heft to easily distinguish it from the lower denominations, and that the dollar, as well as the other coins and currency then in circulation [...] "looks like play money." [...] Senators Mike DeWine of Ohio and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Republican and Democrat respectively, praised the design and the distinctiveness of the golden color.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} some {{historical}} anecdotes that have related to food and wine pairing before modern times.

The principles behind this anecdote lies in the food pairing properties of both fruit and cheeses.

40|$|AbstractThis {{article is}} {{intended}} to analyse the influence of biomass, solar–thermal and small hydraulic power respectively (isolated {{from the rest of}} the special regime) on the final electricity prices of the Spanish Pool and the cost of electricity tariffs. Thus, their influence is compared resulting that the economic impact that they have on the system is uneven. For that analysis, artificial intelligence techniques are used to create a descriptive model of the Pool, by means of an ex-post analysis. Algorithms of different typologies are also analysed. Finally, tree models based on algorithm M 5 P are applied. The main conclusion is that biomass and small hydraulic power have reduced the energy prices of the Pool at 1. 48 and 1. 45 €/MWh, generating an overall saving for the system of € 50. 7 and 200. 6 million, and for <b>the</b> <b>average</b> domestic <b>consumer</b> of € 0. 12 and 3. 01 respectively in 2012.
