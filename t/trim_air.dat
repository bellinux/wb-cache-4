60|$|A convent {{bell was}} ringing to evensong, when passing its gateway; the escort {{turned up a}} low hill, on the summit of which stood a chateau, {{covering}} a considerable extent of ground, with a circuit of wall, whitewashed so as perfectly to glare in the evening sun; at every angle a round, slim turret, crowned by a brilliant red-tiled extinguisher-like cap; and the whole surmounted by a tall old keep in the centre. There was a square projection containing an arched gateway, with heavy doorways, which were thrown open as the party approached. Philip looked up as he rode in, and over the doorway beheld the familiar fretted shield, with the leopard in the corner, and 'A moi Ribaumont' round it. Could it then be Berenger's own castle, and was it thus that he was approaching it? He himself had not looked up; he was utterly spent with fatigue, dejection, and the severe headache {{brought on by the}} heat of the sun, and was only intent on rallying his powers for the crisis of fate that was probably approaching; and thus scarcely took note of the court into which he rode, lying between the gateway and the corps de logis, a building erected when comfort demanded more space than was afforded by the old keep, against which one end leant; but still, though inclosed in a court, the lower windows were small and iron-barred, and all air of luxury was reserved for the mullioned casements of the upper storey. The court was flagged, but grass shot up between the stones, and the <b>trim</b> <b>air</b> of ease and inhabited comfort to which the brothers were used at home was utterly wanting. Berenger was hustled off his horse, and roughly pushed through a deep porch, where the first thing he heard was the Chevalier de Ribaumont's voice in displeasure.|$|E

5000|$|The 1967 El Camino {{followed}} the Chevelle's styling facelift {{with a new}} grille, front bumper, and <b>trim.</b> <b>Air</b> shocks remained standard equipment on the El Camino, allowing the driver to compensate for a load. The year 1967 also brought the collapsible steering column and options of disc brakes and Turbo Hydramatic 400 3-speed automatic transmission. It was the second year the 396 (L35, L34, and L78) could be had in the El Camino (both 13480 300 Deluxe base and 13680 Malibu series). Since the L35 396/325 hp engine was the base for the SS396 series, the number of L35 engines reported sold by Chevrolet in 1967 (2,565) were sold {{in one of the}} two El Camino series, which were the only other series the engine could be ordered in. Since the L34 (now 350 hp) & L78 (375 hp) were available in either El Camino series as well as the two SS396 body styles, {{there is no way of}} knowing how many of these optional engines went to which body style. Chevrolet does report 17,176 L34 and 612 L78 engine options were sold in 1967 Chevelles, but there is no breakdown of body styles. The TH400 3-speed automatic was now available as an option (RPO M40) with the 396 engine in both the SS396 series and the 396-equipped El Caminos.

40|$|International audienceThe Superconducting FRagment Separator (SuperFRS) {{is a part}} of the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research, a new {{international}} accelerator facility for the research with antiprotons and ions to be built in Darmstadt, Germany. The Super-FRS is a two-stage fragment separator consisting of a PreSeparator and a Main-Separator, which includes 24 superferric H-type dipole magnets with trapezoidal structure and large aperture. The dipole magnets of the separator will have a deflection radius of 12. 5 m, a magnetic field of up to 1. 6 T, and an effective length of more than 2 m to bend ion beams with a rigidity from 2 T · m up to 20 T · m.

40|$|For thermal {{cabin control}} of {{commercial}} aircraft, the cabin is usually divided {{into a small}} number of temperature zones. Each zone features its own air supply pipe. The necessary installation space for ducting increases significantly with the number of zones. This requires the number of temperature zones to be low. Factors such as seating layout, galley placement and passenger density result in deviations in heat flux throughout the cabin. These deviations cannot be compensated by the control system, if they occur within the same temperature zone. This work presents a novel temperature regulation concept based on local mixing. In this concept, two main ducts span the complete cabin length, and provide moderately warm and cold air. At each temperature zone, cabin supply air is locally mixed using butterfly valves. In this way, the number of temperature zones can be individually scaled up without any additional ducting, only requiring additional valves for each temperature zone. The access to hot <b>trim</b> <b>air</b> {{at the site of the}} mixing chamber can therefore be omitted. The advantages of this concept are bought at the expense of a more complex control system and a more sophisticated management of failure modes. Pneumatic coupling between temperature zones is much more pronounced compared with the traditional architecture. A centralized control architecture is required. A prototype architecture is presented, as well as a corresponding control system candidate. Possible strategies for the handling of failure modes are discussed. High fidelity simulations using the object-oriented equation-based modelling language Modelica are used to demonstrate robust performance under a wide range of boundary conditions...|$|E

5000|$|There {{were other}} {{innovative}} design features. Previously ballast containers {{had been made}} in the form of leather [...] "trousers", and one or other leg could be opened at the bottom by a cable-release from the control car. In R101, the extreme forward and aft ballast bags were of this type, and were locally operated, but the main ballast was held in tanks connected by pipes so that ballast could be transferred from one to another to alter the airship's <b>trim</b> using compressed <b>air.</b> [...] The arrangement for ventilating the interior of the envelope, necessary both to prevent any buildup of escaped hydrogen and also to equalise pressure between the outside and inside, was also innovative. A series of flap-valves were situated at the nose and stern of the airship cover (those at the nose are clearly visible in photographs) to allow air to enter when the airship was descending, while a series of vents was arranged around the circumference amidships to allow air to exit during ascent.|$|R
40|$|Processes {{have been}} {{developed}} to produce a solid biofuel with high energy density and low ash content from kraft lignin precipitated from black liquor. Pilot-scale tests of the lignin biofuel were carried out with a 150 kW powder burner and a 12 MW circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler. Lignin powder could be fired in a powder burner with good combustion performance after some <b>trimming</b> of the <b>air</b> flows to reduce swirl. Lignin dried to 10 % moisture content was easy to feed smoothly and had less bridging tendencies in the feeding system than did wood/bark powder. In the CFB boiler, lignin was easily handled and cofired together with bark. Although the filter cake was broken into smaller pieces and fines, the combustion was not disturbed. When cofiring lignin with bark, the sulfur emission increased compared with bark firing only, but most of the sulfur was captured by calcium in the bark ash. Conventional sulfur capture also occurred with addition of limestone to the bed. The sulfur content in the lignin had a significantly positive effect on reducing the alkali chloride content in the deposits, thus reducing the high temperature corrosion risk...|$|R
50|$|The Ranger EV was {{essentially}} a Ford Ranger XL 4X2 Regular Cab featuring an electric vehicle powertrain instead of the Ranger XL's standard I4 engine. The only difference between a Ranger XL and a Ranger EV was that the Ranger EV had no engine, so the tachometer {{that was on the}} Ranger XL was replaced by a battery range gauge on the Ranger EV. Other than this minor difference, the Ranger EV included the standard features that the Ranger XL 4X2 Regular Cab included as standard: an AM and FM radio, two speakers, fifteen-inch steelwheels, a bench seat or bucket seats <b>trimmed</b> in vinyl, <b>air</b> conditioning and a heater, an automatic transmission, two SRS airbags, seating for either two or three passengers, a passenger airbag on/off switch activated by the vehicle's ignition and door key, and vinyl flooring.

All Ranger EV's were painted in Ford's standard Oxford White Clear Coat with a Flint Gray interior.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of an advanced computational analysis of unsteady aerodynamic loads on isolated helicopter rotors in forward flight is described. The primary technical focus of the development was {{the implementation of a}} freely distorting filamentary wake model composed of curved vortex elements laid out along contours of constant vortex sheet strength in the wake. This model captures the wake generated by the full span of each rotor blade and makes possible a unified treatment of the shed and trailed vorticity in the wake. This wake model was coupled to a modal analysis of the rotor blade dynamics and a vortex lattice treatment of the aerodynamic loads to produce a comprehensive model for rotor performance and air loads in forward flight dubbed RotorCRAFT (Computation of Rotor Aerodynamics in Forward Flight). The technical background on the major components of this analysis are discussed and the correlation of predictions of performance, <b>trim,</b> and unsteady <b>air</b> loads with experimental data from several representative rotor configurations is examined. The primary conclusions of this study are that the RotorCRAFT analysis correlates well with measured loads on a variety of configurations and that application of the full span free wake model is required to capture several important features of the vibratory loading on rotor blades in forward flight...|$|R
