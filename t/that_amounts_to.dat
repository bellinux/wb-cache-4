Some advantages are cited for use of numerical digits that represent negative values.

The concept of signed-digit representation has also been taken up in computer design.|$|E

25|$|From the 1980s the UK {{government}} passed several {{acts that}} had a provision concerning sectarian violence. These included the Public Order Act 1986, which introduced offences relating to the incitement of racial hatred, and the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which introduced offences of pursuing a racially aggravated course of conduct <b>that</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> harassment of a person. The 1998 Act also required courts {{to take into account}} where offences are racially motivated, when determining sentence. In the twenty-first century the Scottish Parliament legislated against sectarianism. This included provision for religiously aggravated offences in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003. The Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 strengthened statutory aggravations for racial and religiously motivated crimes. The Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012 criminalised behaviour which is threatening, hateful, or otherwise offensive at a regulated football match including offensive singing or chanting. It also criminalised the communication of threats of serious violence and threats intended to incite religious hatred.|$|E
500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik {{was well}} {{received}} by critics, who praised the Chili Peppers for not overpowering the listener with heavy metal guitar riffs as their previous album had. Rolling Stones Tom Moon credited Rick Rubin {{for the change}} in style; Rubin [...] " [...] the Chilis' dynamic." [...] He went on to praise the overall sound, which [...] "displayed a growing curiosity about studio texture and nuance." [...] Steve Huey of AllMusic said the album was [...] "The Red Hot Chili Peppers' best album... John Frusciante's guitar is less overpoweringly noisy, leaving room for differing textures and clearer lines, while the band overall is more focused and less indulgent." [...] He considered Blood Sugar to be [...] "varying... it expands the group's musical and emotional range." [...] Guitar Player magazine credited Frusciante with the Chili Peppers' drastic change in style: [...] "by blending acid-rock, soul-funk, early art-rock, and blues style with a raw, unprocessed Strat-and-Marshall tone, [...] hit on an explosive formula {{that has yet to}} be duplicated." [...] Devon Powters of PopMatters said that [...] "in one funked-out, fucked up, diabolical swoop, Blood Sugar Sex Magik reconfigured my relationship to music, to myself, to my culture and identity, to my race and class." [...] In an article published in The Tampa Tribune, editor Philip Booth praised the record as [...] "an ambitious effort <b>that</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> a culmination and blossoming of the musical forces that have been brewing in the band's sound since Kiedis and Flea birthed the band in 1983." [...] Robert Christgau gave it an honorable mention in his Village Voice consumer guide, naming [...] "Give It Away" [...] and [...] "Breaking the Girl" [...] as highlights while writing [...] "they've grown up, they've learned to write, they've got a right to be sex mystiks." [...] Chicago Sun-Times critic Michael Corcoran was more reserved in his praise, deeming the record [...] "great" [...] only on occasion while finding the length of the album excessive. Blood Sugar Sex Magik is considered to be an influential album, throughout the nineties, by establishing itself as a fundamental foundation for alternative rock. It has also been referred to as [...] "the cornerstone album of funk rock" [...] by FasterLouder.|$|E

The NCTA also stated that the farms help to stabilize the soil, protect water supplies and provide wildlife habitat. In addition, the industry points to the reduction of carbon dioxide through Christmas tree farming. An independent Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study, conducted by a firm of experts in sustainable development, states that a natural tree will generate 3.1kg of greenhouse gases whereas the artificial tree will produce 8.1kg per year.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to Schäuble's comments, Afghan Economy Minister Amin Farhang {{said that the}} government in Kabul cannot stop donor countries from withholding aid or technical support, but consequences of such withdrawals would be worse for Western countries than Afghanistan. [...] Farhang stated: [...] "I think that politicians in the West, including in Germany, reacted very emotionally. It shouldn't be like that. There's a lack of information. And besides, while the situation hasn't been resolved and the final decision hasn't been made yet, they can't threaten to withdraw security forces or foreign aid. <b>That</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> blackmail." [...] Farhang also said that Kabul is attempting to build democracy after the Taliban was forced from power by US forces in 2001, but that [...] the right to convert from Islam to Christianity is too extreme for a traditional Islamic society such as Afghanistan which upholds the Islamic punishment for apostasy. He also stated: [...] "Afghanistan cannot switch suddenly from one extreme to the other." ...|$|E
2500|$|The revolts were harshly {{suppressed}} by the Manchu {{government in a}} manner <b>that</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> genocide. Approximately a {{million people in the}} Panthay rebellion were killed, and several million in the Dungan revolt as a [...] "washing off the Muslims"(洗回 (xi Hui)) policy had been long advocated by officials in the Manchu government. Many Chinese Muslim generals like Ma Zhanao, Ma Anliang, Ma Qianling, Dong Fuxiang, Ma Haiyan, and Ma Julung helped the Qing dynasty defeat the rebel Muslims, and were rewarded, and their followers were spared from the genocide. The Han Chinese Qing general Zuo Zongtang even relocated the Han from the suburbs Hezhou when the Muslims there surrendered as a reward so that Hezhou (now Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture) is still heavily Muslim to this day and is the most important city for Hui Muslims in China. The Muslims were granted amnesty and allowed to live as long as they stayed outside the city. Some of the Muslims who fought, like General Dong, did not do it because they were Muslim, rather, like many other generals, they gathered bands of followers and fought at will.|$|E

2500|$|Joshua [...] "carries out a {{systematic}} {{campaign against the}} civilians of Canaan— men, women and children— <b>that</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> genocide." [...] In doing this he is carrying out herem as commanded by Yahweh in Deuteronomy 20:17: [...] "You shall not leave alive anything that breathes". The purpose is to drive out and dispossess the Canaanites, with the implication that there are to be no treaties with the enemy, no mercy, and no intermarriage. [...] "The extermination of the nations glorifies Yahweh as a warrior and promotes Israel's claim to the land," [...] while their continued survival [...] "explores the themes of disobedience and penalty and looks forward to the story told in Judges and Kings." [...] The divine call for massacre at Jericho and elsewhere can be {{explained in terms of}} cultural norms (Israel was not the only Iron Age state to practice herem) and theology (a measure to ensure Israel's purity as well as the fulfillment of God's promise), but Patrick D.

2500|$|However, {{there is}} no direct {{evidence}} that Darwin had read the book, and his letter to Charles Lyell stating that he had ordered the book clearly indicates {{that he did not have}} a copy in his extensive library or access to it elsewhere. The particular claim that Robert Chambers had read and transmitted Matthew's ideas that are relevant to natural selection is also not supported by the facts. The article in the Chambers's Edinburgh Journal (1832, vol. 1, no. 8, 24 March, p. 63) is not a review but only an abridged excerpt from pp. 8-14 of On Naval Timber <b>that</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> no more than a recipe for pruning and contains nothing of relevance to natural selection. It is headed [...] "ON THE TRAINING OF PLANK TIMBER" [...] and ends with [...] ".— Matthew on Naval Timber." [...] Even if it had been penned by Robert Chambers, this does not mean that he had read or understood, leave alone transmitted, the other passages of Matthew's book that do contain anything relevant to natural selection. Further, The Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation contain nothing of relevance about natural selection. Combining these facts, Robert Chambers had probably not read or received the message about natural selection in Matthew's book, but has surely not promulgated it in the Vestiges, and probably neither in conversations.|$|E
