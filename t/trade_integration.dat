2500|$|In the West, the {{decision}} was made through Treaty of Rome 1957 to launch the first European Economic Community. It shared the Assembly and Court with the Coal and Steel Community, but set up parallel bodies for the Council and Commission. Based on the Spaak Report of 1956, it sought to break down all barriers to trade in a common market for goods, services, labour and capital, and prevent distortion of competition and regulate areas of common interest like agriculture, energy and transport. A separate treaty was signed for a European Atomic Energy Community to manage nuclear production. In 1961 the United Kingdom, Denmark, Ireland and Norway applied for membership only to be vetoed in 1963 by France's Charles de Gaulle. Spain also applied and was rejected as it was still led by the Franco dictatorship. The same year, the Court of Justice proclaimed that the Community constituted a [...] "new legal order of international law". The Merger Treaty 1965 finally placed the ECSC and Euratom within the EEC. Shortly after, de Gaulle boycotted the Commission, which he believed was pressing supranationalism too far. The Luxembourg compromise in 1966 agreed that France (or other countries) could veto issues of [...] "very important national interest", particularly relating to the Common Agricultural Policy, instead of making decisions by [...] "qualified majority". But after the May 1968 events in France and de Gaulle's resignation, the way was free for the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark to join in 1973. Norway had rejected joining in a 1972 referendum, while the UK confirmed its membership in a 1975 referendum. Aside from the European Economic Community itself, the European continent underwent a profound transition towards democracy. The dictators of Greece and Portugal were deposed in 1974, and Spain's dictator died in 1975, enabling their accession in 1981 and 1986. In 1979, the European Parliament had its first direct elections, reflecting a growing consensus that the EEC should be less a union of member states, and more a union of peoples. The Single European Act 1986 increased the number of treaty issues in which qualified majority voting (rather than consensus) would be used to legislate, as a way to accelerate <b>trade</b> <b>integration.</b> The Schengen Agreement of 1985 (not initially signed by Italy, the UK, Ireland, Denmark or Greece) allowed movement of people without any border checks. Meanwhile, in 1987, the Soviet Union's Mikhail Gorbachev announced policies of [...] "transparency" [...] and [...] "restructuring" [...] (glasnost and perestroika). This revealed the depths of corruption and waste. In April 1989, the People's Republic of Poland legalised the Solidarity organisation, which captured 99% of available parliamentary seats in June elections. These elections, in which anti-communist candidates won a striking victory, inaugurated a series of peaceful anti-communist revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe that eventually culminated in the fall of communism. In November 1989, protestors in Berlin began taking down the Berlin Wall, which became a symbol of the collapse of the Iron Curtain, with most of Eastern Europe declaring independence and moving to hold democratic elections by 1991.|$|E

50|$|In extreme cases, it is {{possible}} for a country to only exhibit one of these characteristics and still have positive pegging potential.

The opposite is true, a country that has zero symmetry of shocks but has maximum <b>trade</b> <b>integration</b> (effectively one market between member countries). *This can be viewed on an international scale as well as a local scale.

Growth in the transition economies had been driven by <b>trade</b> <b>integration</b> into the world economy with “impressive” export performance, and by “rapid capital inflows and a credit boom”. But such growth had proved volatile and the EBRD considered that governments in the transition economies should foster the development of domestic capital markets and improve the business environment, including financial institutions, real estate markets and the energy, transport and communications infrastructure. The EBRD expressed concerns about regulatory independence and enforcement, price setting, and the market power of incumbent infrastructure operators.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the current situation}} pertaining to <b>trade</b> and financial <b>integration</b> in East Asia from various approaches and discusses potential linkages between intra-regional <b>trade</b> and financial <b>integration.</b> This paper also offers policy suggestions based upon its analyses that take full account of the post-global crisis policy landscape. The main conclusions drawn from this study are as follows: (i) the overall degree of intra-regional <b>trade</b> and financial <b>integrations</b> in East Asia still remain insufficient, as the regionfs financial integration lags far behind its trade integration; (ii) inter-regional links appear stronger than intra-regional links in East Asian economies; and (iii) intra-regional trade and portfolio investment flows in East Asia generally show positive correlations. Developing East Asia would benefit from wider regional mechanisms with the enhancement of intra- regional <b>trade</b> and financial <b>integration.</b> Since East Asia is at a critical turning point, this paper suggests that East Asian countries strive to strengthen the regional mechanisms with smoothly functioning, integrated regional markets while effectively controlling its risks. They should focus especially on enhancing trade policy cooperation, expediting capital market development, effectively managing cross-border portfolio investments, and strengthening regional safety networks. The three major countries in the region-Japan, China, and Korea-should {{take the lead in}} facilitating the <b>integration</b> process. <b>Trade</b> and Financial <b>Integration,</b> Cross-Border Investment and Settlement, Trade-Finance Linkage, Free Trade Agreements, Asian Bond Market, East Asia, Global Economic and Financial Crisis...|$|R
