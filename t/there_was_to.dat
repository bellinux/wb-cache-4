5|$|After the drawn Second Test, Simpson {{contracted}} chickenpox, so Booth {{was again}} captain for the Third Test {{in front of}} his home crowd at the SCG. It was an extra burden, as Booth had made only 49 runs in the first two Tests; his teammates felt that their captain had been too anxious following his struggles against Griffith in the Caribbean. However, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be no fairytale for Booth, who later admitted to being in psychological disarray; he was unaware if the rolling done on the pitch after the toss was legal, and Philpott arrived late and ran onto the field just as play was starting.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{were the}} reigning champions of England having won the Football League First Division title in 1990–91. The team had only lost one match in their {{successful}} league campaign, to Chelsea in February 1991. Arsenal's opponents Wrexham had finished {{bottom of the}} entire Football League the previous season. In normal circumstances this meant the club would have been relegated to the Football Conference, but the Football League's plan to expand its competition {{in time for the}} 1991–92 season meant <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be no demotion.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of their victory, Plymouth Argyle {{returned}} to the third tier of English football just one year after being relegated to the fourth tier {{for the first time in}} its history. They returned to the Third Division two years later before being promoted as champions in 2002, and the club followed that up by winning the Second Division in 2004, to reclaim their place in the second tier of English football after a twelve-year hiatus. For Darlington, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be more disappointment in the play-offs four years later under David Hodgson, Platt's successor.

Britain waited until 1825, after the Battle of Ayacucho, to recognize Mexico, Gran Colombia, and Río de la Plata. Both nations recognized more Spanish American states in the next few years.|$|E

Australia, with a bowler short, was unable to force a win without him. The Fifth Test was on his home ground at Sydney with the series locked 1–1. He captured 3/43 and 3/80, taking a wicket with his final ball in Test cricket when Alan Smith was caught at slip by Bob Simpson.

5|$|In 1552 Mercator {{moved from}} Leuven to Duisburg in the Duchy of Cleves.

In many English {{classrooms}} throughout the world, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> students who mistrust or even fear each other because they belong to groups {{with a history of}} conflict based on national, political, ethnic, or other differences. Intergroup conflict often endures because people do not have the opportunity to interact with each other personally and rely instead on long-standing stereotypes. The actions of governments often make solutions difficult <b>to</b> reach; nevertheless, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many instances where bridging cultural divides has reduced the tension between conflicting groups. Teachers and nonprofit organizations have long been involved in bringing conflicting groups together in educational contexts in order to promote mutual acceptance of dissimilar worldviews and cultures. For several reasons, the English as a second/foreign language (ESL/EFL) classroom is an especially ideal setting to deal with intergroup conflict. Successful language teaching uti-lizes methods designed to engage students in communicative activities based on their backgrounds, opinions, and other personal characteristics. A classroom composed of students with widely different cultures offers lots of potential for excitement and discov-ery, as well as for creating empathy and advancing the acquisition of English. This article will describe some ESL/ EFL activities that promote this type of interpersonal tolerance betwee...|$|R
