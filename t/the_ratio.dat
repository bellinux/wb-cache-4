5|$|The {{balance between}} the {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD/NADH ratio. This ratio {{is an important component}} of what is called the redox state of a cell, a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells. The effects of the NAD/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of <b>the</b> <b>ratio</b> between free NAD and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; <b>the</b> <b>ratio</b> is thus favourable for oxidative reactions. <b>The</b> <b>ratio</b> of total NAD/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 3–10 in mammals. In contrast, the NADP/NADPH ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH.|$|E

30|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in <b>the</b> <b>ratios</b> R_nij of <b>the</b> order statistics from some suitable distribution.
