5|$|September 25, 1998 - Hurricane Georges {{passes over}} Key West as a Category2 {{hurricane}}, and days later it moves eastward through the Florida Panhandle after hitting Biloxi, Mississippi. In the Florida Keys, the hurricane produced 8.41inches (214mm) {{of rain in}} Tavernier and wind gusts peaking at 110mph (177km/h) in Marathon. There, Georges damages 1,363homes and destroys 173houses, with damage amounting to $270million (1998USD) in <b>the</b> <b>Keys.</b> <b>In</b> the Florida Panhandle, the storm drops 38.46inches (977mm) of rain in Munson and results in $70million in damage (1998USD, $93million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1821, the House of Keys had no {{official}} home, but met first at Castle Rushen, and {{later at the}} Bishop of Sodor and Man's library in Castletown. After criticism from a Royal Commission, plans were drawn up for a new meeting house for <b>the</b> <b>Keys</b> <b>in</b> 1813, but after concerns about the cost, they were redrawn and approved in 1819. The building, designed by Thomas Brine, was completed in 1821. It housed the House of Keys until 1874, when the Keys followed the other primary functions of the island and moved to Douglas. After their move, the Old House became a branch of 's Bank, and later Parr's Bank. In 2000, Manx National Heritage acquired the building and began restoring the house to how it appeared in 1866. The building {{opened to the public}} as a museum in November 2001.|$|E

25|$|In {{countries}} {{using the}} Latin script, the center, alphanumeric {{portion of the}} modern keyboard is most often based on the QWERTY design by Christopher Sholes, who laid out <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>in</b> {{such a way that}} common two-letter combinations were placed {{on opposite sides of the}} keyboard so that his mechanical keyboard would not jam, and laid out <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>in</b> rows offset horizontally from each other by three-eighths, three-sixteenths, and three-eighths inches to provide room for the levers. Although it has been demonstrated that the QWERTY layout is not the most efficient layout for typing, it remains the standard.|$|E

25|$|Starting in 1704, it was {{the policy}} of the Spanish {{government}} to resettle Florida Indians in Cuba so that they could be indoctrinated into the Catholic faith. The first group of Indians, including the cacique of Cayo de Guesos (Key West), arrived in Cuba in 1704, and most, if not all of them, soon died. In 1710, 280 Florida Indians were taken to Cuba, where almost 200 soon died. The survivors were returned to <b>the</b> <b>Keys</b> <b>in</b> 1716 or 1718.

25|$|One {{particular}} {{weakness of}} this method with OpenSSL is that it always limits encryption and authentication security of the transmitted TLS session ticket to AES128-CBC-SHA256, no matter what other TLS parameters were negotiated for the actual TLS session. This means that the state information (the TLS session ticket) is not as well protected as the TLS session itself. Of particular concern is OpenSSL's storage of <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>in</b> an application-wide context (SSL_CTX), i.e. {{for the life of}} the application, and not allowing for re-keying of the AES128-CBC-SHA256 TLS session tickets without resetting the application-wide OpenSSL context (which is uncommon, error-prone and often requires manual administrative intervention).|$|E
25|$|Emmel and Perry (2004) {{believed}} {{there to be}} shifts in the relative abundances of the three Orthalicus taxa in <b>the</b> <b>Keys.</b> <b>In</b> the past, Orthalicus floridensis {{was the most common}} and widespread of the three, whereas subsequent to 2000, Emmel and Perry (2004) considered the Orthalicus floridensis to be the rarest. This situation results partly from the translocations that bolstered Orthalicus reses reses distribution and allowed them to avoid extinction, but probably also reflects actual declines in Orthalicus floridensis populations over time. Orthalicus reses reses now occur in sympatry with their congeners in several locations. The observations of Emmel and Perry (2004) suggested that translocated Orthalicus reses reses, all of which are outside the historic range, perform as well or better than congeners in those places where they overlap.|$|E

After killing Al-Mualim, Altaïr took possession of the Apple of Eden and assumed leadership of the Assassins. One of the Assassins, Abbas, did not support Altaïr due to past events, and for killing Al Mualim. When Altaïr and his wife Maria left Masyaf for 10 years to repel the Mongol invasion, Abbas staged a coup d'etat, seizing control of the Assassins and executing Altaïr's youngest son Sef. Altaïr sought revenge; but as Maria tried to stop him, another Assassin stabbed Maria in the back. Altaïr was forced to flee with his elder son, Darim, and went into self-imposed exile for 20 years. Altaïr finally returned to Masyaf, killed Abbas, then took his rightful place as the Assassins' leader. In the process, Altaïr told the dying Abbas {{the truth of the}} latter's father's death. Years later, an aged Altaïr encodes his memories on the five keys Ezio would find, entrusting them to Niccoló.|$|E

500|$|The {{sections}} {{comprising the}} cantata are traditionally grouped into four movements. The musicologist Carol Traupman-Carr notes: [...] "Although movements {{are marked by}} tempo changes, occasionally key changes, meter changes, and double bar lines, Cantata 106 {{appears to be a}} continuous work. Bach helps create a more seamless effect by occasionally resolving the cadence of one section at the downbeat of another, thus blurring the beginnings and endings of traditional movements." [...] The keys and tempo markings are taken from the first publication. <b>The</b> <b>keys</b> <b>in</b> the Neue Bach-Ausgabe and other more recent publications start in F major.|$|E

Gardiner finds all three cantatas for the occasion, dealing with God's word, [...] "characterised by his vivid pictorial imagination, an arresting sense of drama, and by music of freshness and power that lodges in the memory".|$|E
500|$|Originally {{proposed}} {{for inclusion in}} Everglades National Park, Biscayne Bay was cut from the proposed park to ensure Everglades' establishment. It remained undeveloped until the 1960s, when a series of proposals were made to develop <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>in</b> the manner of Miami Beach, and to construct a deepwater seaport for bulk cargo, along with refinery and petrochemical facilities on the mainland shore of Biscayne Bay. [...] Through the 1960s and 1970s, two fossil-fueled power plants and two nuclear power plants were built on the bay shores. A backlash against development led to the 1968 designation of Biscayne National Monument. The preserved area was expanded by its 1980 re-designation as Biscayne National Park. The park is heavily used by boaters, and apart from the park's visitor center on the mainland, its land and sea areas are accessible only by boat.|$|E

500|$|Over {{twenty years}} after the Royal Commission's damning report {{on the state of}} the library in which the Keys met, the Governor of the Isle of Man, John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl, {{instructed}} Thomas Brine, the Clerk of Works for public buildings, to cost and draw plans for a new House of Keys. These plans were rejected by the British Home Department and Treasury as too expensive, and despite repeated demands for a new meeting place, the proposal was put on hold. Brine carried out a survey of the library in 1817 at the request of the Keys, and condemned the building, resulting in the meetings of the Keys being held in a public house, the George Inn. Despite the comfort afforded by the building, it was criticised as being [...] "...highly improper for any Court of Justice and particularly so, for one of such importance in this Island as the House of Keys", as recorded in the Journal of <b>the</b> <b>Keys</b> <b>in</b> October 1817.|$|E
