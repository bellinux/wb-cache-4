5|$|Sales {{and profits}} grew {{year-on-year}} {{during the early}} 1950s. The prepayment from the government was repaid in 1952. For a short time, VAT imported and marketed clearing tractors produced by Italian firm Ansaldo-Fossati. Although there was demand for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle,</b> they sold poorly because their price was considered inconsistent with their technical quality; only a few units were delivered in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The charges vary {{according}} to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Motorcycles are free but there are standard charges for cars, two-axle goods vehicles and larger vehicles with more than two axles.

40|$|The total {{emission}} level is {{heavily dependent on}} the number <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Additionally, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their age structures are very important. The structure <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> also depends on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> the road. The article {{presents the results of}} calculations of the pollutants emission from the road transport. Total emission was calculated with combination of the investigation results i. e. the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their age structures for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> roads. The investigations have been made for different classes of roads with different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The traffic line has been recorded in the same length of time. On the basis of analysis of the recorded traffic line, the number and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> have been estimated. The classification <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> have been made according to the level of emission i. e. passenger cars, light duty vehicles, heavy duty vehicles, busses and others, taking into consideration the age structures <b>of</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The level <b>of</b> total traffic emission has been calculated on the basis of results. There has been used the Copert programme methodology. The results of the calculations have been made with combination <b>of</b> the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> road, the speed <b>of</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> and their age structure, are presented...|$|R

5|$|Communication {{between human}} and horse is {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle {{on their backs}} to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{power-assisted}} steering on any <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> dates to 1876, but little is recorded of the system. Other {{attempts were made}} to add {{power-assisted steering}} to motorized vehicles such as in the 1903 Columbia 5-ton truck and other heavy vehicles, {{but it was not until}} 1928 that a practical hydraulic power system was invented by Francis W. Davis. It was used on some armored vehicles and heavy trucks during World War II, but it took more than decades before the system was commercialized in passenger automobiles.|$|E
5|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 30% {{of its body}} weight. While all horses can pull more than they can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle,</b> road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could pull a small war chariot at speed. Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses. The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater weight with a horse collar than they could with a breast collar, and even less with an ox yoke.|$|E

5|$|The passive visual {{warnings}} {{are usually}} {{part of the}} design of the vehicle, and involve the use of high contrast patterns. Older ambulances (and those in developing countries) {{are more likely to have}} their pattern painted on, whereas modern ambulances generally carry retro-reflective designs, which reflects light from car headlights or torches. Popular patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called 'Battenburg', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads – often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards on the rear) or stripes along the side (these were the first type of retro-reflective device introduced, as the original reflective material, invented by 3M, only came in tape form). In addition to retro-reflective markings, some services now have the vehicles painted in a bright (sometimes fluorescent) yellow or orange for maximum visual impact. Fire Department-operated Ambulances are often painted similarly to their apparatuses for ease of identification and the fact that bright red is a very striking color appropriate for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
