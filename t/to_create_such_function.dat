40|$|Creating {{a musical}} fitness {{function}} is largely subjective {{and can be}} critically affected by the designer’s biases. Previous attempts <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>such</b> <b>functions</b> for use in genetic algorithms lack scope or are prejudiced to a certain genre of music. They also are limited to producing music strictly in the style determined by the programmer. We show in this paper that musical feature extractors, which avoid the challenges of qualitative judgment, enable creation of a multi-objective function for direct music production. The main {{result is that the}} multiobjective fitness function enables creation of music with varying identifiable styles. To demonstrate this, we use three different multi-objective fitness functions <b>to</b> <b>create</b> three distinct sets of musical melodies. We then evaluate the distinctness of these sets using three different approaches: a set of traditional computational clustering metrics; a survey of non-musicians; and analysis by three trained musicians...|$|R

Such mixed-signal circuits offer smaller size and lower cost, but must carefully account for signal interference. Prior to the late 1990s, radios could not be fabricated in the same low-cost CMOS processes as microprocessors. But since 1998, {{a large number of}} radio chips have been developed using CMOS processes. Examples include Intel's DECT cordless phone, or 802.11 (Wi-Fi) chips created by Atheros and other companies.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MComm (Mathematics)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The {{general purpose}} of this thesis is the {{analysis}} of multivariate refinement equations, with focus on the bivariate case. Since box splines are the main prototype of such equations (just like the cardinal B-splines in the univariate case), we make them our primary subject of discussion throughout. The first two chapters are indeed about the origin and definition of box splines, and try to elaborate on them in sufficient detail so as to build on them in all subsequent chapters, while providing many examples and graphical illustrations to make precise every aspect regarding box splines that will be mentioned. Multivariate refinement equations are ones that take on the form (x) =Xi 2 Zn pi (Mx − i), (1) where is a real-valued function, called a refinable function, on Rn, p = {pi}i 2 Zn is a sequence of real numbers, called a refinement mask, and M is an n × n matrix with integer entries, called a dilation matrix. It {{is important to note}} that any such equation is thus simultaneously determined by all three of, p and M — and the thesis will try and explain what role each of these plays in a refinement equation. In Chapter 3 we discuss the definition of refinement equations in more detail and elaborate on box splines as our first examples of refinable functions, also showing that one can actually use them <b>to</b> <b>create</b> even more <b>such</b> <b>functions.</b> Also observing from Chapter iii iv 2 that box splines demand yet another parameter from us, namely an initial direction matrix D, we focus on the more general instances of these in Chapter 4, while keeping the dilation matrix M fixed. Chapter 5 then in turn deals with the matrix M and tries to generalize some of the results found in Chapter 3 accordingly, keeping the initial direction matrix fixed. Having dealt with the refinement equation itself, we subsequently focus our attention on the support of a (bivariate) refinable function — that is, the part of the xy-grid on which <b>such</b> a <b>function</b> “lives” — and that of a refinement mask, in Chapter 6, and obtain a few results that are in a sense introductory to our work in the next chapter. Next, we move on to discuss one area in which refinable functions are especially applicable, namely subdivision, which is analyzed in Chapter 7. After giving the basic definitions of subdivision and subdivision convergence, and investigating the “sum rules” in Section 7. 1, we prove our main subdivision convergence result in Section 7. 2. The chapter is concluded with some examples in Section 7. 3. The thesis is concluded, in Chapter 8, with a number of remarks on what has been done and issues that are left for future research...|$|R
