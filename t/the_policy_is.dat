In {{assessing}} whether policies fall foul of this rule, a court cannot {{reject the}} way in which an administrative body formulated a policy in favour of its own view of how the discretion should have been exercised. Furthermore, a policy is not Wednesbury-unreasonable if the court simply feels that it may not work effectively.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> womyn-born womyn <b>policy</b> {{generated}} {{some controversy}} during the 1980s when pressure {{was put on}} the coffeehouse to allow admittance to men, {{as well as in the}} 1990s when <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> contested by transgender women. It <b>was</b> claimed that <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> discriminatory and created [...] "mental difficulties" [...] for transgender women. <b>The</b> <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> also challenged in the 1990s by a local gay male journalist. However, the organization staunchly defended <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> and never allowed admittance to men or to transgender women.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} about the High School Equalization <b>Policy</b> in <b>the</b> Republic of Korea. The bulk of {{research}} until recently focused mainly on the problem after <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> implemented. Accordingly, research on <b>the</b> original <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> scarce. So, <b>the</b> {{aim of this study}} is to understand more fully <b>the</b> original <b>policy,</b> particularly, <b>the</b> influence on the competition between schools by <b>the</b> <b>policy.</b> As a research method, analysis transition of school ranking before and after <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> used to examine...|$|R

25|$|Certain life {{insurance}} contracts accumulate cash values, {{which may be}} taken by the insured if <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> surrendered or which may be borrowed against. Some policies, such as annuities and endowment policies, are financial instruments to accumulate or liquidate wealth when it is needed.|$|E
25|$|The only Group Policy {{settings}} {{available for}} AutoRun affect the NoDriveTypeAutoRun Registry entries. <b>The</b> <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> available on either a per-machine or a per-user basis reflecting the Registry entry location in either HKLM or HKCU. As described above, a per-machine policy setting {{will cause the}} per-user policy setting to be ignored.|$|E
25|$|While John Arquilla, a {{professor}} at the Naval Postgraduate School, cites the ability to plan separate and widely dispersed attacks, coordinated by mobile communications that might originate from a cave on the Afghan-Pakistan border, he does not emphasize the apparent al-Qaeda technique of releasing operational units to local control, once <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> set.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> {{abandoned}} in 1996, after the 1996 federal election replaced the Labor Party with John Howard's Coalition in power. <b>The</b> new <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> to develop <b>the</b> country's uranium mining industry and uranium exports.|$|R

Bush's weekly radio addresses.|$|E
25|$|When {{a policy}} is Enabled, Group Policy will add the NoDriveTypeAutoRun {{entry to the}} Registry. If <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> Disabled or set to Not configured, Group Policy deletes this entry from the Registry for the Machine policy (in HKLM) and sets it back to system {{defaults}} value for the User policy (in HKCU). System defaults may then take effect {{as described in the}} NoDriveTypeAutoRun section.|$|E
25|$|The {{misinterpretation}} of some regulations {{has led to}} {{the confusion}} that certain universities do not prescribe headwear, most notably the Open University where <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> that academic headgear is not worn at graduation ceremonies, whilst some universities have abandoned headwear for socio-political reasons or because the designer intended it, such as is the case of Vivienne Westwood and her design for King's College London.|$|E

50|$|After <b>the</b> extreme heat <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> {{invoked in}} {{consecutive}} years in 2006 and 2007, <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> again changed starting in 2008 to allow matches in progress to be halted {{at the conclusion}} of the set. Prior to that a match already underway had to <b>be</b> completed. <b>The</b> <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> further changed in 2008 to allow play to be stopped only at the discretion of the tournament referee, rather than relying solely on temperature and WBGT calculations.|$|R

25|$|Jordan {{does not}} allow entry to Jews with visible signs of Judaism or even with {{personal}} religious items in their possession. The Jordanian ambassador to Israel replied to a complaint by a religious Jew denied entry that security concerns required that travelers entering the Hashemite Kingdom not do so with prayer shawls (Tallit) and phylacteries (Tefillin). Jordanian authorities state that <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> {{in order to ensure}} the Jewish tourists' safety.|$|E
25|$|Western {{central banks}} decided to sharply cut {{interest}} rates to encourage growth, deciding that inflation was a secondary concern. Although this was the orthodox macroeconomic prescription at the time, the resulting stagflation surprised economists and central bankers. <b>The</b> <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> now considered by some to have deepened and lengthened the adverse effects of the embargo. Recent research claims that in the period after 1985 the economy became more resilient to energy price increases.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the {{university}} implemented {{a new policy}} requiring all first-year, full-time undergraduate students to live on campus. The goal of <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> to provide new students with a comprehensive educational experience. Students exempt from this new rule include those who remain living with their parents and/or legal guardians within Hillsborough, Pasco, and Pinellas counties, are above the age of 21 by {{the first day of}} fall classes, have a dependent child or family member, or are married.|$|E

30|$|At firm birth phase, none of <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> factors <b>were</b> {{significant}} in both countries. At the persistence and established phases, none of <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> factors <b>were</b> {{significant in}} Nigeria whereas in South Africa, all <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> factors <b>were</b> significant. This implies that <b>the</b> <b>policies</b> in South Africa have significant impact on, and are enhancing, their entrepreneurial activities whereas in Nigeria, {{the impact of}} <b>the</b> <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> negligible and often not felt (Chukwuemeka, 2011). Most of the Nigerian entrepreneurs are pushing through and trying to survive despite <b>the</b> poorly implemented <b>policies</b> in <b>the</b> country (Mary, Enyinna, & Ukpai, 2015). At the renowned phase, however, none of <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> factors <b>were</b> significant. This is understandable because at this phase, the entrepreneurs are well grounded and most of their businesses are self-sustaining.|$|R
25|$|The {{policy toward}} {{refugees}} from North Korea is a recurring human rights issue. It is official policy to repatriate these refugees to North Korea, but <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> not evenly enforced and {{a considerable number}} of them stay in the People's Republic. Though it is in contravention of international law to deport political refugees, as illegal immigrants their situation is precarious. Their rights are not always protected, and some are tricked into marriage or prostitution.|$|E
25|$|In theory, Iranian {{agricultural}} policy {{is intended to}} support farmers and encourage the production of strategically important crops. <b>The</b> <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> twofold: first, to purchase certain crops at guaranteed prices and second, to encourage the production of specific crops through farm subsidies. The policy of purchasing agricultural crops from farmers at guaranteed prices {{was put in place}} in the 1989 crop year. On average, the guaranteed prices increased at the rate of inflation over the past 15 years. Individual subsidy levels for major crops, however, vary annually.|$|E
25|$|Out of the 32 {{million people}} that {{received}} free basic water in 2005, almost half, or 15 million, were not poor. Furthermore, many poor in rural areas, who receive limited {{amounts of water}} for free through standpipes, do not benefit fully. Those without access to publicly provided water do not benefit at all from the program. <b>The</b> <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> more successful in wealthier municipalities, which {{have the ability to}} cross-subsidise water provision for the poor, than in poorer, often rural municipalities. This {{is one of the reasons}} why in 2009 the government announced it would review its implementation strategy for free basic water, possibly through registers of poor users.|$|E

5000|$|Mr. Wolsay, a {{shipping}} manager, stated he felt <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> [...] "totally discriminatory", and the New Zealand Herald suggested to the airline that {{the implication of}} <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> that [...] "it considered male passengers to be dangerous to children". New Zealand's Green Party stated that <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> discriminatory and reported the matter to the Human Rights Commissioner.On learning of <b>the</b> <b>policies</b> several protests occurred including a 22-hour tree top protest by double amputee Kevin Gill in Nelson. He stated that <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> thin end of a wedge with men soon banned from sitting next to children at sports events and on other forms of public transport.
