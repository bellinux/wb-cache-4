5|$|Even {{people with}} {{complete}} SCI, in whom {{the spinal cord}} cannot transmit any messages past {{the level of the}} lesion, can achieve orgasm. In 1960, in one of the earliest studies to look at orgasm and SCI, the term phantom orgasm was coined to describe women's perception of orgasmic sensations despite SCI—but subsequent studies have suggested <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> not merely psychological. Men with complete SCI report sexual sensations at the time of ejaculation, accompanied by physical signs normally found at orgasm, such as increased blood pressure. Women can experience orgasm with vibration to the cervix regardless of level or completeness of injury; the sensation is the same as uninjured women experience.|$|E

5|$|Oh, What a Knight! is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film follows a young woman, named May Brandon, who dreams a medieval fantasy in which she is wooed, rescued and married by a loyal knight. When she awakes, she dismisses her fiancé and tells him of her dream. He decides to become the knight of her dreams and dresses as one, but <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> unpleasant and ruins her fantasy. There are no known staff or cast credits for the film, but a surviving film still shows three actors. The film was released on October 18, 1910 and was met with praise by The New York Dramatic Mirror. The film had a wide national release and was also shown in Canada, but is now presumed lost.|$|E

25|$|The Wii U GamePad was {{described}} as a survival kit for players. It was inspired by the studio's previous game, Peter Jackson's King Kong, in which players make use of the environment to survive (such as using a torch to scare off enemies); the team made the GamePad a survival kit, taking considerable time to fine-tune the GamePad's functions. Although it was initially possible for players to plan strategy with the GamePad, they rarely did so. The team then retooled the system to include features such as the mini-map, resulting in players focusing on the GamePad and ignoring the action on the TV. Eventually, the team balanced player time on both screens by switching from first- to third-person perspective when the player uses the survival kit. Players are vulnerable when using the kit, prompting them to look at the TV screen while using the GamePad. This increases the game's tension, making it more scary to play. According to Guillaume, the team realized this potential when they implemented the lock-pick feature (when players must be aware of their surroundings while trying to unlock a door). To further immerse players in the game, the voice of the Prepper is channeled through the GamePad's speakers and players need to read text with the pad; since the GamePad is a real-world object, <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> more intimate. The pad displayed most crucial information to the player, and the game did not have a user interface.|$|E

40|$|Consumers use affective {{evaluations}} of past hedonic experiences {{in their future}} decision-making. However, past evaluations such as how enjoyable <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>was</b> {{may be hard to}} retrieve, and consumers tend to recall what they did (i. e. the constituent activities of <b>the</b> prior <b>experience)</b> in order to reconstruct them. It is proposed here that recalling these constituent activities in a packed versus unpacked fashion will distort both the reconstruction process and its outcome. Results from two experiments show that mental unpacking interacted with experience enjoyment to alter past evaluations in two ways: if the enjoyment of <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>was</b> high, unpacked recalls increased remembered enjoyment, but unpacking decreased remembered enjoyment if <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> enjoyment <b>was</b> low. Finally, mediation analysis indicated that the unpacking by enjoyment interaction distorted future preferences through the mediating role of remembered enjoyment...|$|R

500|$|The Jain {{doctrine}} of Anekantavada, {{also known as}} Anekantatva, states that truth and reality is complex and always has multiple aspects.

Language [...] is not Truth, but a means and attempt to express Truth. From Truth, according to Mahavira, language returns and not the other way around.

Any attempts to express <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> syāt, or valid [...] "in some respect" [...] but it still remains a [...] "perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete".
