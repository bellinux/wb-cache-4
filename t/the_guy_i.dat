25|$|Mandy and Adam {{were later}} shown the entire suicide note. Mandy reports that Adam {{immediately}} voiced {{that he did}} not see anything on the letter than indicated it was written by Daniel, and the note appeared to be 'cold' and 'matter-of-fact'. The note also stated 'don't blame <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> was with last night'. When Mandy and Adam asked the Police if they had looked into who the note was referring to, the Police said they didn't know, may never know, and that they weren't ever going to find out all the answers. Mandy reported that in hindsight, she doesn't feel Dagenham Police were investigating properly, and they wouldn't have had to look very far to find out Port was behind it, and save another family from emotional turmoil. When Mandy wished to challenge the open verdict or continue investigation, she reported that she was told that nothing more could be done, and she felt there was an attitude of 'it is what it is, deal with it'.|$|E
500|$|The {{design as}} a whole tried to create {{technology}} that could be built in the 1940s, though with the added Cube technology in Hydra's case. Abandoned Nazi projects or actual vehicles from the period were used as inspiration. Daniel Simon, who was previously responsible for many vehicle designs in , was appointed Lead Vehicle Designer. Director Johnston cited Simon's book Cosmic Motors {{as a reason to}} trust his influence, saying [...] "he's sort of <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> wanted to be when I was designing stuff for Star Wars". The Red Skull's car, for instance, was based on two Mercedes-Benz vehicles from the 1930s, the 540K and the G4.|$|E
50|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>I</b> {{spoke to}} were real losers. These guys weren't James Bond type {{characters}} at all, they weren't <b>the</b> type of <b>guys</b> you'd like {{to hang around}} with. Most of them were really insecure.|$|R

5000|$|In 2007, Boy George {{said that}} the song was [...] "not just about Culture Club's drummer Jon Moss, my boyfriend at the time. It was about all <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>I</b> dated {{at that time in}} my life." ...|$|R
500|$|Jones {{was cast}} as Rooney {{based on his}} role in Amadeus, where he played the emperor; Hughes thought that character's modern {{equivalent}} was Rooney. [...] "My part was actually quite small in the script, but {{what seemed to be}} the important part to me was that I {{was the only one who}} wasn't swept along by Ferris", recalls Jones. [...] "So I was the only one in opposition, which presented a lot of opportunities, some of which weren't even in the script or were expanded on. John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. So that was fun, working with him." [...] "Hughes told me at the time — and I thought he was just blowing his own horn — he said, 'You are going to be known for this for the rest of your life.' And I thought, 'Sure'... but he was right." [...] To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal. [...] "This is <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> want you to pay close attention to," [...] Jones explained to Hughes' biographer Kirk Honeycutt. While meeting him, the VP's coat momentarily flew open revealing a holster and gun attached to the man's belt. This made Jones realize what Hughes had envisioned."The guy was 'Sign up for the Army quick before I kill you!'" [...] Jones exclaimed.|$|E

[...] "I went to a mate's house to watch the FA Cup Final, everyone {{in the house was}} supporting the other team except <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> sat next to.

2500|$|During a 1985 {{interview}} with [...] "Frets" [...] magazine, Jerry Garcia {{was asked if}} he was inspired by any non-guitarists. [...] He said [...] "Oh, yeah, sure. Art Tatum is my all-time favorite. Yeah, he's my all-time favorite. He's <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> put on when I want to feel really small. When I want to feel really insignificant. He's a good guy to play for any musician, you know. He'll make them want to go home and burn their instruments. Art Tatum is absolutely the most incredible musician – what can you say?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Stool Pigeon" [...] was {{inspired}} by a newspaper article Darnell had read about a former Mafia boss who had been let out of jail after providing information about his former colleagues, and had now had his identity changed and protected by the FBI. Darnell said, [...] "I actually had compassion for <b>the</b> <b>guy.</b> <b>I</b> thought, wow, what a way to go. And I could understand why he did it. He sold out for the money and the comfort, I guess the very things that had brought him into the underworld." [...] The song also features Darnell's attempt at the then newly fashionable art of rapping—he later confessed, [...] "That's just me goofing at being a rapper, which was the last thing I ever wanted to do".|$|E
2500|$|In his sole outing over 10,000m in 2010 he ran 27:12.43 minutes – {{the sixth}} fastest that year. At the {{beginning}} of 2011 he won his stage of the New Year Ekiden. A 10,000m run in 27:09.02 minutes saw him gain selection for the 2011 World Championships in Athletics in Daegu. Ibrahim caused an upset in the 10,000m final by overhauling Mo Farah {{in the final stages}} of the race to win the gold medal. Farah had been undefeated up until that point that year while Ibrahim had come from relative obscurity, having competed only in Japan for almost two years. Runner-up Farah said [...] "I didn't have a clue about <b>the</b> <b>guy.</b> <b>I</b> hadn't seen him, so I didn't know what he could do or what he was capable of." [...] Ibrahim was Ethiopia's only athlete to finish in the top two of an event at that year's championships. He closed the year with another 10,000m gold medal at the 2011 All-Africa Games.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2005, Watkins {{stated in}} a PopMatters {{interview}} when discussing her first solo-written recorded song, [...] "Anthony", that she [...] "definitely makes the effort write more, but it's something that doesn't come {{too easy for}} me.

2500|$|In October 2007, his {{autobiography}} Batista Unleashed was released. In an interview about the book, Bautista claims [...] "I didn't {{want to tell}} my story unless it was honest," [...] and that [...] "you {{have to go through}} three sets of lawyers: Simon & Schuster lawyers, WWE lawyers, my lawyers. Everything now being the way it is, you can be sued for the simplest thing." [...] One source of controversy was the book's mentioning of Chris Benoit, who was almost completely removed due to his double murder and suicide. Bautista responded saying, [...] "I loved <b>the</b> <b>guy.</b> <b>I</b> despise what he did, but that doesn't erase him from my life. I fought to keep him in there and glad they did." [...] When asked about his ex-wife, Angie, he says [...] " [...] have really become close again, which we really haven't been in years. I really learned a lot about her, and she learned a lot about me from reading the book. She actually saw things from a different perspective from reading the book. So that was definitely therapeutic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thus {{began his}} {{transition}} into the brash, bombastic manager [...] "Captain" [...] Lou Albano. With a quick wit and a grating personality, Albano delivered memorable promos and earned the scorn of the wrestling audience as {{he attempted to}} dethrone World Wide Wrestling Federation superstar and WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino. Albano described the strategy behind his overblown, ranting interview style: [...] "I just remember the point I wanna bring across, and then I just babble before, during, and after. [...] Somehow, in the middle, I said {{the two or three}} sentences that sold tickets. [...] Mostly, I just tried to make people want to see me get my ass kicked, and along the way, hopefully <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> was managing would catch a beating too!" [...] Growing out his hair and beard, and packing on extra pounds, Albano gave the image of a wild man. He developed a later trademark, applying rubber bands to his beard, after having seen a homeless man do the same. He also often wore a rubber band hanging from a safety pin pushed through his cheek.|$|E
2500|$|Although ostensibly over-seeing the {{animated}} Turtles projects through Mirage, Laird had minimal hands-on {{involvement in the}} development of the original animated series, and even less with [...] series. One of the unique products of this series, female turtle Venus, is notorious for becoming one of the additions to the franchise that Laird most despises. However, he took a more active role in the next TMNT animated venture, acting as [...] "a consultant, and... working with <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> consider the head writer, Lloyd Goldfine." [...] In this role, he says [...] "rom the get-go I've been looking at everything, from day one. Story premises, outlines, the full scripts and the sketching and designing of characters and settings. I've been doing a little drawing myself. Lots of suggestions. I've seen a few of the episodes, and it's neat to see a lot of the stuff I've worked on." [...] While final preparations were underway, he relaunched the official comics canon of the franchise with [...] "Volume Four" [...] (the third published by Mirage Studios), with artwork supplied by fellow TMNT writer, friend, and Rat King creator Jim Lawson. When the new series proved a success, Laird relaunched Tales of the TMNT to accompany the fourth volume.|$|E

5000|$|Shelton {{said of the}} song, [...] "That song had me {{from the}} first, ‘cause I thought about all <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>I</b> know back in Tishamingo.

2500|$|On 31 May 2011, Khan {{agreed to}} fight 33 year old two-weight {{champion}} Zab Judah (41-6, 28 KOs) {{in attempt to}} unify the IBF and WBA light welterweight titles in Las Vegas on 23 July. Judah had reclaimed the IBF title two months earlier against Kaizer Mabuza. Khan was unhappy that a fight with Bradley could not be made. He said, [...] "Bradley was <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> wanted to fight but he chickened out. I offered him 50% of UK revenue, which is unheard of, and 50% of all revenue in America, that's how much I wanted to fight him, but he didn't want it." [...] The fight was broadcast on Primetime in UK and HBO in USA. Khan started the fight with a left jab. Round 1 saw a busy Amir Khan as he fought from the outside and kept Judah away with jabs and straights. All four rounds were taken by Khan. Ultimately on the fifth round Zab was taken down with a right uppercut to the body, in which at first commentators believed it was a low blow, since Judah was showing signs of agonising pain, {{but when it was}} seen from a different camera angle, it was right on the belt, leading to an 18th knockout for Khan in his career so far. Khan later rejected claims for the low blow saying, [...] "He went down. It was above the belt. Zab's a great fighter. I respect him a lot. But it was nowhere near below [...] It was a great shot." [...] Over 5 rounds, Khan landed 61 of 284 total punches (21%) and Judah landed 20 of 115 (17%). For the fight, Khan earned $1,072,500 and Judah had a $500,000 purse. The fight averaged 1.4 million viewers on HBO.|$|E
