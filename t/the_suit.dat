5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that the insulation in such a suit was not provided by the water between <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> were insulative. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.|$|E

A later content patch added <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> of Lunacy, Storms, Furies, and Blessings.

5|$|In 2005, Elissa Wall filed {{a multimillion-dollar}} {{lawsuit against the}} FLDS, Warren Jeffs, and the UEP Trust with the {{expressed}} intention to assist {{other members of the}} FLDS in leaving the community. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> was ongoing for several years afterwards, and a CPA filed a counter-lawsuit in response, charging that Wall's family, not the FLDS or the UEP Trust, was responsible for her underage marriage.

The lawsuit follows a dramatic die off of bees in the United States, with some beekeepers losing 50% of their hives.

500|$|Khan's {{suit was}} made of {{reinforced}} latex, coloured steel-blue and fitted with micro-computer circuitry. Rampal's suit {{was made of}} three-inch thick solid rubber, and was red in color. Both actors were required to wear additional suits inside their body suits to prevent skin contact. Wearing <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> created a number of difficulties for the actors. It took 20 minutes to put on <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> and 40 minutes to remove them. In addition, the non-porous nature of <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> created intense heat inside, causing excessive perspiration {{despite the presence of}} special air conditioning ducts. Khan later felt that the suits' conception had been a mistake since filming occurred during the day; digital adjustments to <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> brought [...] "all the efforts to naught." ...|$|R

5|$|The title monster was {{designed}} by production designer Richard Cassarino, who created <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> for $500, and was built over a diver's wetsuit. Conditions inside <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> were very hot; combined with the humid weather, this caused Clarke, who performed his own stunts in the film, to sweat profusely. The original mask is currently owned by archivist and occasional actor Bob Burns. Cassarino later worked as production designer for the 1958 film Hell Squad, and also was responsible for designing the sea creature costume in the science fiction film Destination Inner Space (1966).|$|E

5|$|After {{moving into}} the Kirchherr family's house, Sutcliffe used to borrow her clothes, as he was the same height as Kirchherr. He wore her leather pants and jackets, collarless jackets, {{oversized}} shirts, and long scarves. He also borrowed a corduroy suit with no lapels that he wore on stage, which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him <b>the</b> <b>suit.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Another {{big change}} to {{swimming}} occurred when Speedo launched the LZR Racer swim suits on February 13, 2008. <b>The</b> <b>suits,</b> developed by NASA and the Australian Institute of Sport, {{were designed to}} repel water, allow oxygen to flow to the muscles, and hold the body in a more hydrodynamic position. <b>The</b> <b>suits</b> had been proven to give the swimmer a lower time by 1.9 to 2.2%. Due to the advantage provided by <b>the</b> <b>suits,</b> some swimmers complained about the fairness in its use, because some people used multiple swimsuits to improve buoyancy and compressing of body; even the official blog for the National Collegiate Athletic Association pondered whether they were [...] "technology doping" [...] {{and what was the}} difference between gaining advantage from a swimsuit and gaining advantage from performance-enhancing drugs. In response to these complaints, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) scheduled a meeting with Speedo to discuss <b>the</b> <b>suits.</b> After <b>the</b> meeting, FINA dismissed the claims of cheating, and endorsed <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> for future swimming meets. By August 14, 2008, 62 world records had been broken by swimmers wearing the LZR Racer.|$|R
50|$|In {{all cases}} the King ('mir' or 'shah') {{is always the}} strongest card in each <b>suit,</b> {{followed}} by <b>the</b> Vizier. However, in half <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> <b>the</b> numerical cards rank in logical order from 10 strongest (just below the Vizier), down to 1 (weakest), and <b>the</b> other <b>suits</b> <b>the</b> order of the numerical cards is reversed, with the ace strongest (just below the Vizier), and the 10 weakest, thus giving the order K,V,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. If playing with a Moghul type pack, <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> with <b>the</b> 'reverse order' numerical cards are barat, zar-e zorkh, qomash, and chang (bills, red gold coins, cloth, and harps) in India; in Iran, zar-e safīd (white coins) were inverted instead of the red coins. In Dashavtar packs <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> with reversed cards are the first avatars, Matsya, Kutchha, Varaha, Nrusinha and Waman (fish, turtle, boar, lion and round vessel symbols).|$|R
5000|$|A Buster Brown {{suit was}} a very popular style of {{clothing}} for young boys in the United States in the early 20th century. It was named after the comic strip character Buster Brown, created in 1902 by Richard Felton Outcault. [...] It typically consisted of a belted, double-breasted tunic or jacket worn with a large round collar, floppy bow, and shorts or knickerbockers, and was often worn with a round straw hat and a haircut with bangs. Along with <b>the</b> sailor <b>suit,</b> <b>the</b> Eton <b>suit,</b> <b>the</b> Norfolk <b>suit</b> and <b>the</b> Fauntleroy <b>suit,</b> <b>the</b> Buster Brown <b>suit</b> is cited {{as one of the}} key looks in boys' clothing of the period.|$|R
5|$|Carl Johnson sued Jefferson County for {{unlawful}} termination, {{after he}} was forced to resign from his position as Director of the Jefferson County Health Department.

5|$|Felix Cedeno, a 31-year-old American, sued 20th Century Fox for $2.25 million, {{after he}} was filmed {{as part of a}} scene where a live chicken fell out of Borat's {{suitcase}} on the subway. Cedeno later dropped <b>the</b> <b>suit,</b> and received nothing.|$|E

50|$|A few games use <b>the</b> German <b>suited</b> 36 card deck {{that lacks}} any {{dedicated}} trump suit. Instead, one of <b>the</b> existing <b>suits,</b> customarily <b>the</b> heart <b>suit,</b> is chosen as <b>the</b> trump <b>suit.</b> These include Württembergischer Tarock, Bavarian tarock, Brixentaler Bauerntarock, and Dobbm.

5000|$|At {{some point}} in the game, one of the players can select balls 1-7 (the [...] "solids") or balls 9-15 (the [...] "stripes") as their group (or suit) of object balls by legally {{pocketing}} a ball from one group. The other player is assigned <b>the</b> other <b>suit.</b> Balls pocketed on the break shot are not used to assign <b>the</b> <b>suits.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> have been assigned, they remain fixed throughout the remainder of the game.|$|R
2500|$|As cards {{spread from}} Italy to Germanic countries, <b>the</b> Latin <b>suits</b> were {{replaced}} with <b>the</b> <b>suits</b> of Leaves (or Shields), Hearts (or Roses), Bells, and Acorns, and {{a combination of}} Latin and Germanic suit pictures and names resulted in <b>the</b> French <b>suits</b> of trèfles (clovers), carreaux (tiles), cœurs (hearts), and piques (pikes) around 1480. The trèfle (clover) was probably derived from the acorn and the pique (pike) from the leaf of <b>the</b> German <b>suits.</b> <b>The</b> names [...] "pique" [...] and [...] "spade", however, may have derived from the sword (spade) of <b>the</b> Italian <b>suits.</b> In England, <b>the</b> French <b>suits</b> were eventually used, although the earliest packs circulating may have had Latin suits. This may account to why the English called the clovers [...] "clubs" [...] and the pikes [...] "spades".|$|R
