40|$|Tuna fishing has {{historically}} been based on a complex network of socio-labor interactions involving {{a significant number of}} fishers having a variety of specific functions. Tasks have been divided into three main stages: preparation and deployment of the fishing gear; harvesting activities inside the trap, and dismantling of this impressive fishing tool. The captain emerges as the key figure watching over this wide range of activities, since all the technical tasks necessary for the different stages of the fishing to be properly executed depend on the captain (as well as others, as an intermediary between the company and the crew). His sensorial and intellectual skills and practical learning ability continue to underpin the operation of this centuries-old fishing mode, although the latest changes in the technical and economic organization of blue fin tuna fishing have changed the socio-cultural landscape of the traps. A theoretical reflection is given of the concept of vernacular expertise based on a description of these skills and their historical evolution (18 th century onwards). The analysis focuses on tuna traps on the Andalusian Atlantic coast (SW Spain), and reviews the history of the fishery from the late 18 th century to the present day; i. e., the historical period during which the previous fishing gear, the so-called " mobile " <b>tuna</b> <b>trap</b> (the almadraba de tiro or almadraba de vista (alternative names)) has been replaced by the " static " <b>tuna</b> <b>trap</b> (the almadraba fija or almadraba de buche (alternative names)) ...|$|E

40|$|We {{critically}} {{reviewed the}} contributions of fishery genetics {{to the understanding of}} spatial population structure and dynamics in Mediterranean bluefin tuna by comparatively integrating existing data with those recently obtained from on-going surveys. Microsatellite-based population genetic studies provided coherent and informative evidences which consistently indicate a spatial genetic structure of Mediterranean bluefin tuna. By integrating the existing genetic data with those obtained from other approaches, {{it is likely that the}} Mediterranean is inhabited by reproductively isolated subpopulations, displaying different spatio-temporal population dynamics. On-going bluefin tuna genetic surveys addressed the identification of such subpopulations in the bluefin tuna catches from a Sardinian trap. However, the genotyping of 275 bluefin tuna individuals collected over five years performed on six neutral and 10 underselection microsatellite loci did not provide evidence of genetic heterogeneity within catches. The lack of genetic heterogeneity signals within <b>tuna</b> <b>trap</b> catches might be related to the inadequateness of these marker loci. A new genomic approach using a huge number of underselection SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) might represent a promising tool to resolve the complex bluefin tuna population structure and traceabilit...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} {{growth in the}} catches of bluefin tuna in the Atlantic Ocean {{and especially in the}} Mediterranean Sea for the last decade due to the expansion of fattening farms which export their production to Japan. There has been an increase in catches due to strong demand and, consequently, it has produced a degree of exploitation of the stock. According to ICCAT, this could cause the extinction of the resource, and as a result recommendations have been made. For this reason, the European Union has imposed drastic cuts in TACs, which have affected not only the purse-seining fishing fleet which was supplying tuna to farms, but also the artisanal fleet segments which continue ancient fishing activities such as the tuna traps in the South of Spain. In this paper the current situation of this sector is presented in detail. The existing interrelationships between the profitability of firms and catches and, above all, between the profitability of firms and the situation of the bluefin tuna demand in the Japanese market are analysed. This is because this market determines the price obtained by <b>tuna</b> <b>trap</b> firms. This price is established by Japanese wholesalers {{at the beginning of each}} fishing season...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} boat noise on the {{behaviour}} of bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus {{was investigated in}} the Egadi Islands, Sicily, during spring 2005 using a fixed <b>tuna</b> <b>trap</b> set near shipping routes. Tuna behaviour was observed when exposed to both natural ambient sound and sound generated by hydrofoil passenger ferries, small boats and large car ferries. Acoustical and behavioural analyses were conducted with and without extraneous sound to define a list of behavioural categories. Each vessel produced different engine sounds {{with regard to their}} composition and bandwidth, and all were distinctly different from ambient sound levels. In the absence of boat noise, tuna assumed a concentrated coordinated school structure with unidirectional swimming and without a precise shape. When a car ferry approached, tuna changed swimming direction and increased their vertical movement toward surface or bottom; the school exhibited an unconcentrated structure and uncoordinated swimming behaviour. Hydrofoils appeared to elicit a similar response, but for shorter periods. Agonistic behaviour was more evident when exposed to sounds from outboard motors of small boats. This study showed that local noise pollution generated by boats produced behavioural deviations in tuna schools. Schooling enhances tuna homing accuracy during their spawning migration, and an alteration in schooling behaviour can affect the accuracy of their migration to spawning and feeding grounds...|$|E

The main threats to this species come from pollution in the Mediterranean and bycatch capture in various fishing equipment including trawls, <b>tuna</b> <b>traps,</b> and dragnets meant for swordfish. The 2004 IUCN Red List listed the devil fish as a vulnerable species. It was reclassified as endangered in 2006 due to low population resilience coupled with continued high bycatch mortality.|$|R
40|$|In nature, non-stationarity {{is rather}} typical, {{but the number}} of {{statistical}} tools allowing for non-stationarity remains rather limited. Wavelet analysis is such a tool allowing for non-stationarity but the lack of an appropriate test for statistical inference as well as the difficulty to deal with multiple time series are 2 important shortcomings that limits its use in ecology. We present 2 approaches to deal with these shortcomings. First, we used 1 /ƒβ models to test cycles in the wavelet spectrum against a null hypothesis that takes into account the highly autocorrelated nature of ecological time series. To illustrate the approach, we investigated the fluctuations in bluefin <b>tuna</b> <b>trap</b> catches with a set of different null models. The 1 /ƒβ models approach proved to be the most consistent to discriminate significant cycles. Second, we used the maximum covariance analysis to compare, in a quantitative way, the time–frequency patterns (i. e. the wavelet spectra) of numerous time series. This approach built cluster trees that grouped the wavelet spectra according to their time–frequency patterns. Controlled signals and time series of sea surface temperature (SST) in the Mediterranean Sea were used to test the ability and power of this approach. The results were satisfactory and clusters on the SST time series displayed a hierarchical division of the Mediterranean into a few homogeneous areas that are known to display different hydrological and oceanic patterns. We discuss the limits and potentialities of these methods to study the associations between ecological and environmental fluctuations...|$|E
40|$|The species {{composition}} {{and extent of}} large elasmobranch bycatch in the Sardinian <b>tuna</b> <b>trap</b> fisheries have received minimal attention in the primary literature. The Sardinian Large Elasmobranch Database (SLED), a non-governmental project, contains records from direct observations, fishing industry sources and reviews from the literature regarding the extent and composition of large elasmobranch bycatch from the only six tuna traps at six fishing sites (Saline; Capo Testa; Carloforte: Portoscuso; Calasetta; and Portopaglia) from the period of 1990 to 2009. During this time period, 42 bycatch events were documented that were comprised of the incidental capture of 15 Mobulid rays and 27 large sharks representing ten species and seven families (23 % of the total elasmobranch species previously reported in Sardinian waters). Even though the low number of collective elasmobranchs captured (n = 42) in this study does not pose a conservation concern several bycatch species considered rare and/or depleted in this region were among the species observed. Mobula mobular was the most abundant elasmobranch species caught, with Alopias vulpinus the most commonly caught shark species. There were differences in the catch per unit effort between the six sites with the highest CPUE occurring in Saline, Carloforte and Porto Paglia. Although the sheer volume and conservation impact of traditional tuna traps on large elasmobranchs is exceeded by other fishing gears in Mediterranean waters, small scale (long term) bycatch monitoring programs are vital when evaluating the presence, biodiversity and conservation of elasmobranchs in previously unstudied areas.

40|$|Atlantic {{little tuna}} (Euthynnus alletteratus) {{is one of}} the most {{abundant}} small tuna species in the Mediterranean Sea. This species are commercially exploited in the Spanish coast by traditional fisheries, mainly <b>tuna</b> <b>traps,</b> but also is target by recreational coastal trawl fishery. The aim of this paper is to update biological information about this species in the Western Mediterranean and to show possible differences between these gear catches. Size and weight data were collected from a Spanish Mediterranean trap (la Azohia, Murcia) (100 specimens) and from recreational coastal fisheries (339). Data were collected along 2006 in order to determine size-weight relationships and size distributions of the population. The Atlantic litle <b>tuna</b> collected in <b>Traps</b> ranging from 61 to 85 cm. in fork length (FL) and the specimens caught by the recreational fisheries from 36 to 46 cm. FL. Significative differences were found between both size distributions. The recreational fisheries target mainly juveniles and the traps mainly mature fishes. The size distribution of trawl catches showed a unique modal value (39. 5 cm) suggesting that all specimens correspond to age class 1. The reproductive stock is mainly made of 4 age classes (2 to 5 +). Our data indicates that age class 4 is totally recruited to the trap fishery and constitutes the main age class in the stock reproductive biomass. This and other biological aspects will be discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of gametogenesis is {{of paramount importance}} to develop a reliable technology for Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus L.) (ABFT) rearing in captivity. The aims of this study were: a) to evaluate the capacity of male ABFT, confined in captivity before puberty, to finalize spermatogenesis; b) to compare germ cell proliferation between wild and captive ABFT. Testis samples were taken from: a) 13 juvenile ABFT reared in the North Adriatic Sea (Croatia); b) 30 adult ABFT reared in the central and western Mediterranean (Spain, Malta and Italy); c) 20 adult wild ABFT captured by <b>tuna</b> <b>traps</b> in Italy and Morocco. Samples were fixed in 10 % formalin, dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Proliferating germ cells were identified through the immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The first spiniform ray of the first dorsal spine was taken from the juvenile fish in order to estimate the age through the count of annual discontinuities. Juvenile ABFT captured before puberty were able to finalize spermatogenesis starting from 3 years of age. Germ cell proliferation was delayed in captive-reared ABFT specimen compared to wild individuals. These results seem to indicate that testis maturation can be anticipated in ABFT caught before puberty, but spermatogenesis is somewhat damaged in adult fish reared in captivity compared to wild individuals...|$|R
40|$|The cDNA {{sequences}} of vitellogenin receptor proteins (VgR+ and VgR−), containing or lacking the O-linked sugar domain, were determined in Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus L.). VgR− gene {{expression in the}} ovary was compared in captive-reared and wild Atlantic bluefin tuna during the reproductive cycle. Gonad samples from adult fish were sampled from 2008 to 2010 from stocks reared in captivity at different commercial fattening operations in the Mediterranean Sea and from wild individuals caught either by traditional <b>tuna</b> <b>traps</b> during their migration towards the spawning grounds in the Mediterranean Sea or by the long-line artisanal fishery. In addition, juvenile male and female Atlantic bluefin tuna were sampled from a farming facility, to obtain baseline information and pre-adulthood amounts of VgR−. The total length of VgR+ cDNA was 4006 nucleotides (nt) and that of VgR− was 3946 nt. Relative amounts of VgR− were greater in juvenile females and in those adults having only previtellogenic oocytes (119 ± 55 and 146 ± 26 folds more than juvenile males, respectively). Amounts of VgR− were less in individuals with yolked oocytes (ripening stage, May–June) and increased after spawning in July (92 ± 20 and 113 ± 13 folds more than juvenile males in ripening and post-spawning fish, respectively). These data suggest that regulation of VgR− is not under oestrogen control. During the ripening period, greater VgR− gene expression was observed in wild fish than in fish reared in captivity, possibly because of (a) differences in water temperature exposure and/or energy storage, and/or (b) an inadequate diet in reared Atlantic bluefin tuna...|$|R
40|$|Thirteen adult blueﬁn tuna were tracked with elec- tronic pop-up {{satellite}} tags {{during their}} reproductive migration towards Mediterranean spawning grounds {{as they entered}} the Strait of Gibraltar. Fish were caught in <b>tuna</b> <b>traps</b> and tagged either underwater, {{with the aid of a}} modiﬁed spear gun, or on the deck of the boat. Fish tagged on board initially showed a shallower behavior than those tagged in the water. The pattern of horizontal movements was also different between both groups. Shortly after tagging, the eight ﬁsh tagged in the water entered the Mediterranean Sea. Six of these ﬁsh reached the spawning ground located south- west of the Balearic archipelago before headin g back for the Atlantic, whereas the other two traveled far- ther east, reaching its easternmost longitudes between Formentera and Sardinia and the South Tyrrhenian Sea, respectively. In contrast, two out of the ﬁve ﬁsh tagged on board never entered the Mediterranean Sea, and another one did enter the Medi terranean when the reproductive season was already over. These results suggest an impact of the tagging procedure on the post-release behavior of blueﬁn tuna. Exclu ding the tags that popped-off east of the Strait of Gibra ltar, blueﬁn tuna stayed in the Mediterranean Sea for 22 – 28 days. Analysis of the median depth indicated a shallow behavior during both day and nighttime throughout the return phase of the ﬁsh from the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean with the exception of the area around the Strait of Gibraltar, where they showed a deeper behavior that coincided with a marked vertical gradient in the currents.

The second part reconstructs the evaluation of tunatrapping in two distinct ways: one relating to its memory and undeniable fascination for generations of writers and other artists who have focused their attention on fishing; the second offers strategies for classifying certain aspects of present-day tuna-trapping that could be validated as "heritage", to illustrate real and possible, good and poor management practices...|$|R
40|$|From April to June Atlantic bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus, migrate {{along the}} western Sardinian {{coastline}} in a southward direction, where they are intercepted by the trap fishery.

40|$|This study {{documents}} {{body temperature}} in the Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus L.) in the Mediterranean Sea and temperature variability caused by the stress of capture. The investigation {{was carried out in}} the traditional trap (tonnara) of Isola Piana (Sardinia, W Mediterranean) where body temperature recordings were conducted on free-swimming bluefin confined in the system of nets known as “camere” or chambers. We tracked the body temperature of two bluefin tuna (214 and 191 cm CFL) using a commercial data logger (HOBO U 12, Onset Computer Corporation), under two conditions: the pre-fishing phase, when specimens confined in the “camera di ponente” are undisturbed and the fishing phase when bluefin <b>tuna</b> are <b>trapped</b> in the “camera della morte” and undergo the stress of confinement and capture (mattanza). Body temperature increased by about 2 °C during the “mattanza”, whereas no temperature variation was exhibited during the pre-fishing phase. The heat transfer coefficient (K), calculated for both bluefin tuna during the “mattanza”, revealed a rapid increase in heat transfer. Additional data on ambient temperature Ta, white muscle Tw (n = 65; 110 – 287 cm CFL) and red muscle temperature Tr, (n = 249; 107 – 287 cm CFL) were obtained from live fish during angling operations, and excess body temperature (Tx = Tr–Ta) was calculated.
