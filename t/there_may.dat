5|$|Crystals {{are often}} {{idealized}} as being perfectly periodic. In that ideal case, the atoms are positioned on a perfect lattice, the electron density is perfectly periodic, and the Fourier transform F(q) is zero except when q {{belongs to the}} reciprocal lattice (the so-called Bragg peaks). In reality, however, crystals are not perfectly periodic; atoms vibrate about their mean position, and <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be disorder of various types, such as mosaicity, dislocations, various point defects, and heterogeneity in the conformation of crystallized molecules. Therefore, the Bragg peaks have a finite width and <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be significant diffuse scattering, a continuum of scattered X-rays that fall between the Bragg peaks.|$|E

Excavations in 1885 found floor tiles with coats of arms and a pavement from the 14th century beneath which were several coffins.

5|$|Goldstone's theorem {{in quantum}} field theory states that in a system with broken {{continuous}} symmetry, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> exist excitations with arbitrarily low energy, called the Goldstone bosons.

5|$|In fast-progressing cases, {{mortality}} {{was primarily}} from pneumonia, by virus-induced pulmonary consolidation.

5|$|Irreversible {{competitive}} antagonists also involve {{competition between}} the agonist and antagonist of the receptor, but the rate of covalent bonding differs and depends on affinity and reactivity of the antagonist. For some antagonist, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be a distinct period during which they behave competitively (regardless of basal efficacy), and freely associate to and dissociate from the receptor, determined by receptor-ligand kinetics. But, once irreversible bonding has taken place, the receptor is deactivated and degraded. As for non-competitive antagonists and irreversible antagonists in functional assays with irreversible competitive antagonist drugs, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be {{a shift in the}} log concentration–effect curve to the right, but, in general, both a decrease in slope and a reduced maximum are obtained.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E

5|$|A {{botanical garden}} or botanic garden is a garden {{dedicated}} to the collection, cultivation and display {{of a wide range}} of plants labelled with their botanical names.

Visitor services at a botanical garden might include tours, educational displays, art exhibitions, book rooms, open-air theatrical and musical performances, and other entertainment.|$|E
