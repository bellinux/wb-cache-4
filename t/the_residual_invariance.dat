40|$|In this work, we pursue further {{consequences}} of a general formalism for non-covariant gauges developed in an earlier work (hep-th/ 0205042). We carry out further analysis of the additional restrictions on renormalizations noted in that work. We use {{the example of the}} axial gauge A_ 3 = 0. We find that if multiplicative renormalization together with ghost-decoupling is to hold, the "prescription-term" (that defines a prescription) cannot be chosen arbitrarily but has to satisfy certain non-trivial conditions (over and above those implied by the validity of power counting) arising from the WT identitites associated with <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> gauge <b>invariance...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I studied the Symanzik's method for the {{introduction}} of the boundary in a field theory and, specifically, I applied this method to three Topological Field Theories of the Shwartz type: the non-abelian Chern-Simons model, the non-abelian three-dimensional BF theory and its abelian four-dimensional version. This thesis is organized into three chapters. In Chapter 1 {{the introduction of}} the boundary in the non-abelian CS model is illustrated. The purpose of this chapter is to describe some techniques known in literature, which are largely used in the following chapters. In Chapter 2 the three-dimensional non-abelian BF theory with a boundary is analyzed. The most interesting result of this chapter is the interpretation of the boundary term of the Ward Identities as the gauge-fixing for <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> gauge <b>invariance</b> of <b>the</b> theory on the boundary. In Chapter 3 the techniques developed in the previous chapters are applied to the abelian BF theory in four space-time dimensions with a boundary. The most interesting result of this chapter, (and of the entire thesis), is the characterization of the boundary dynamics in terms of canonical commutation relations generated by the algebra of local boundary observables, which exists due to <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> gauge <b>invariance</b> of <b>the</b> bulk theory. The results obtained suggest that this model can be considered as an effective theory for the (3 + 1) D Topological Insulators. Comment: 95 pages, no figures, Master's thesi...|$|R

40|$|Conformal algebra on R x S^ 3 {{derived from}} {{quantized}} gravitational fields is examined. The model we {{study is a}} renormalizable quantum theory of gravity in four dimensions described by a combined system of the Weyl action for the traceless tensor mode and the induced Wess-Zumino action managing non-perturbative dynamics of the conformal factor in the metric field. It is shown that <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> diffeomorphism <b>invariance</b> in <b>the</b> radiation^+ gauge {{is equal to the}} conformal symmetry, and the conformal transformation preserving the gauge-fixing condition that forms a closed algebra quantum mechanically is given by a combination of naive conformal transformation and a certain field-dependent gauge transformation. The unitarity issue of gravity is discussed in the context of conformal field theory. We construct physical states by solving the conformal invariance condition and calculate their scaling dimensions. It is shown that the conformal symmetry mixes the positive-metric and the negative-metric modes and thus the negative-metric mode does not appear independently as a gauge invariant state at all.

40|$|We study cosmological {{perturbations}} in Hořava-Lifshitz Gravity. We consider scalar metric fluctuations about {{a homogeneous}} and isotropic space-time. Starting {{from the most}} general metric, we work out the complete second order action for the perturbations. We then make use of <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> gauge <b>invariance</b> and of the constraint equations {{to reduce the number}} of dynamical degrees of freedom. After introducing the Sasaki-Mukhanov variable, the combination of spatial metric fluctuation and matter inhomogeneity for which the action in General Relativity has canonical form, we find that this variable has the standard time derivative term in the second order action, and that the extra degree of freedom is non-dynamical. The limit λ→ 1 is well-behaved, unlike what is obtained when performing incomplete analyses of cosmological fluctuations. Thus, there is no strong coupling problem for Hořava-Lifshitz gravity when considering cosmological solutions. We also compute the spectrum of cosmological perturbations. If the potential in the action is taken to be of "detailed balance" form, we find a cancelation of the highest derivative terms in the action for the curvature fluctuations. As a consequence, the initial spectrum of perturbations will not be scale-invariant in a general spacetime background. As an application, we consider fluctuations in an inflationary background and draw connections with the "trans-Planckian problem" for cosmological perturbations. In the special case in which the potential term in the action is of detailed balance form and in which λ = 1, the equation of motion for cosmological perturbations in the far UV takes the same form as in GR. However, in general the equation of motion is characterized by a modified dispersion relation. Comment: 17 pages, 2 eps figure...|$|R

Methods Subjects {{were part of the}} Bipolar Disorder Research Network (BDRN) study with DSM-IV bipolar disorder (n= 389).
