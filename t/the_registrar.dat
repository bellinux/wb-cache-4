5|$|The High Court's {{decision}} was overruled by the Court of Appeal. The Court held that <b>the</b> <b>Registrar</b> had given genuine consideration to Komoco's arguments. It found that <b>the</b> <b>Registrar</b> had been entitled to take, prima facie, the Customs' OMV figures as correct unless {{they had been}} shown to be incorrect. Although <b>the</b> <b>Registrar</b> had been disposed to follow the Customs' OMV, she had equally been concerned to find out whether there had been sufficient reasons for her not to follow the administrative convention. Komoco had neither challenged the sworn evidence given by <b>the</b> <b>Registrar</b> by applying to cross-examine her, nor adduced any evidence to disprove the Registrar's sworn statement. There was thus no merit in Komoco's contention that <b>the</b> <b>Registrar</b> had not given genuine consideration to its representation. Furthermore, Komoco had not provided new evidence not already presented to the Customs to justify a departure from the administrative convention. Therefore, there had not been any compelling reason for <b>the</b> <b>Registrar</b> to re-evaluate her decision. She had adequately justified her refusal to depart from the policy, and had not fettered her discretion.|$|E
5|$|After {{the date}} of the writ of {{election}} and at least two clear days before nomination day, a candidate or prospective candidate must provide <b>the</b> <b>Registrar</b> of Political Donations with a report stating all the donations received from permissible donors that amount to at least $10,000 received during the 12 months preceding the declaration mentioned in the next sentence. He must also submit to <b>the</b> <b>Registrar</b> a declaration stating, to the best of his knowledge and belief, that he did not receive any other donations required to be mentioned in the donation report, and that only donations from permissible donors or allowable anonymous donations were accepted. If this paperwork is in order, <b>the</b> <b>Registrar</b> will issue a political donation certificate not later than the eve of nomination day stating that the candidate has complied with the provisions of the Act.|$|E
5|$|By September 3, 2009, {{attorneys}} representing Mercury Radio Arts, Glenn Beck's media company, {{had requested}} that the domain registrar of Eiland-Hall's website delete the site. Beck's lawyers characterized the site's location as libelous. They demanded that the domain registrar revoke the WhoisGuard privacy-protection service for the website, and turn over contact information for the then-anonymous Eiland-Hall. <b>The</b> <b>registrar,</b> NameCheap, refused. On September 4, 2009, Beck's lawyers sent another letter to the domain registrar, repeating their requests and noting that they had read the website's contents and were therefore aware from statements posted to the site that its operator had been notified by <b>the</b> <b>registrar.</b>|$|E

5|$|Registration {{takes place}} through a third party, a domain name registrar. The {{relationship}} between Norid, <b>the</b> <b>registrar</b> and the holder is regulated through civil legal agreements. <b>The</b> <b>registrar</b> registers the domain {{on behalf of}} the holder, and the holder then holds the right to the domain name until it is terminated, unless a dispute resolution dictates otherwise. Norid charges registrars 60 Norwegian krone (NOK) per registration and change of holder, as well as NOK60 in an annual fee per domain. Registrars must meet criteria regarding technical and administrative resources, must pay an annual fee of NOK5,000 and a deposit of minimum NOK10,000, depending on activity level. Registrars must also undertake a minimum activity of either administrating or registering forty domains per year.|$|E
5|$|Their {{second letter}} to NameCheap {{observed}} that the site was still operational on September 4, 2009, {{in spite of their}} prior requests on behalf of Beck. The domain registrar changed the name server of the website without telling Eiland-Hall; after contacting <b>the</b> <b>registrar,</b> he was permitted to return to his original name server. In an interview with Gawker on September 9, 2009, Eiland-Hall remarked that Beck's attorneys contacted <b>the</b> <b>registrar</b> of the domain, his hosting provider, as well as the company which housed the servers for his website. He noted that the hosting provider informed him they would not cooperate with the requests from Beck's lawyers unless they received a court order.|$|E

While {{a student at}} the RCM, he was told by <b>the</b> <b>registrar,</b> John Stainer, that it would be {{impossible}} to make a living as a harpsichordist. He made his London debut at the Royal Festival Hall in 1966 with the Galliard Harpsichord Trio, which he co-founded with Stephen Preston, flute, and Anthony Pleeth, cello. At this stage, they were playing baroque music on modern instruments. His solo harpsichord debut was in 1968 at the Purcell Room in London.|$|E

5|$|Following his discharge, Statton {{settled in}} Fitzgerald, Tasmania, where he gained {{employment}} in the timber industry.

In 1934, severe bushfires broke out in the Derwent Valley, and Statton took a prominent role in rescue work aiding families isolated by the fire.|$|E

5|$|The Lennons {{were married}} on 23 August 1962 at the Mount Pleasant Register office in Liverpool. Fellow Beatles McCartney and George Harrison were in attendance, as was their manager, Brian Epstein, who was best man; no parents were there. The wedding was farcical, because {{as soon as}} the {{ceremony}} began a workman in the backyard of the building opposite started using a jackhammer which drowned out anything <b>the</b> <b>registrar,</b> Lennon, or Powell said. When <b>the</b> <b>registrar</b> asked for the groom to step forward, Harrison stepped forward instead. With no photographs or flowers the wedding party celebrated afterwards, at Epstein's invitation, in Reece's restaurant in Clayton Square, which was the same restaurant where Lennon's parents, Alfred Lennon and Julia Lennon, had celebrated their marriage in 1938. Lennon was 21 years old, and Powell 22. The newlyweds had no honeymoon, as Lennon had to play an engagement at the Riverpark Ballroom in Chester the same night, although they did travel to the Hotel George V in Paris, for a belated honeymoon on 16 September, but were accompanied by Epstein, even though he had not been invited to join them.|$|E

5|$|If the High Court {{refuses to}} hear an appeal, the case cannot proceed further; similarly, with one exception, once the High Court has heard a case, no {{decision}} may be reviewed by the Court of Appeal.
