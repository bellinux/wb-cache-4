The distribution of properties among the proteins of an interactome has revealed that the interactome networks often have scale-free topology where functional modules within a network indicate specialized subnetworks. Such modules can be functional, as in a signaling pathway, or structural, as in a protein complex. In fact, it is a formidable task to identify protein complexes in an interactome, given that a network on its own does not directly reveal {{the presence of a}} stable complex.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{complex system}} models are often {{formulated}} {{in terms of}} concepts drawn from statistical physics, information theory and non-linear dynamics; however, such approaches are not focused on, or do not include, the conceptual part of complexity related to organization and topological attributes or algebraic topology, such as network connectivity of genomes, interactomes and biological organisms that are very important. Recently, the two complementary approaches based both on information <b>theory,</b> <b>network</b> topology/abstract graph theory concepts are being combined for example {{in the fields of}} neuroscience and human cognition. It is generally agreed that there is a hierarchy of complexity levels of organization that should be considered as distinct from that of the levels of reality in ontology. The hierarchy of complexity levels of organization in the biosphere is also recognized in modern classificationsof taxonomic ranks, such as: biological domain and biosphere, biological kingdom, Phylum, biological class, order, family, genus and species. Because of their dynamic and composition variability, intrinsic [...] "fuzziness", autopoietic attributes, ability to self-reproduce, and so on, organisms do not fit into the 'standard' definition of general systems, and they are therefore 'super-complex' in both their function and structure; organisms can be thus be defined in CSB only as 'meta-systems' of simpler dynamic systems Such a meta-system definition of organisms, species, 'ecosystems', and so on, is not equivalent to the definition of a system of systems as in Autopoietic Systems Theory,; it also differs from the definition proposed for example by K.D. Palmer in meta-system engineering, organisms being quite different from machines and automata with fixed input-output transition functions, or a continuous dynamical system with fixed phase space, contrary to the Cartesian philosophical thinking; thus, organisms cannot be defined merely in terms of a quintuple A of (states, startup state, input and output sets/alphabet, transition function), although 'non-deterministic automata', as well as 'fuzzy automata' have also been defined. Tessellation or cellular automata provide however an intuitive, visual/computational insight into the lower levels of complexity, and have therefore become an increasingly popular, discrete model studied in computability theory, applied mathematics, physics, computer science, theoretical biology/systems biology, cancer simulations and microstructure modeling. Evolving cellular automata using genetic algorithms is also an emerging field attempting {{to bridge the gap between}} the tessellation automata and the higher level complexity approaches in CSB.|$|E
40|$|Clustering is an {{important}} function in data mining. Its typical application includes the analysis of consumer’s materials. Adaptive resonance <b>theory</b> <b>network</b> (ART) is very popular in the unsupervised neural network. Type I adaptive resonance <b>theory</b> <b>network</b> (ART 1) deals with the binary numerical data, whereas type II adaptive resonance <b>theory</b> <b>network</b> (ART 2) deals with the general numerical data. Several information systems collect the mixing type attitudes, which included numeric attributes and categorical attributes. However, ART 1 and ART 2 do not deal with mixed data. If the categorical data attributes are transferred to the binary data format, the binary data {{do not reflect the}} similar degree. It influences the clustering quality. Therefore, this paper proposes a modified adaptive resonance <b>theory</b> <b>network</b> (M-ART) and the conceptual hierarchy tree to solve similar degrees of mixed data. This paper utilizes artificial simulation materials and collects a piece of actual data about the family income to do experiments. The results show that the M-ART algorithm can process the mixed data and has a great effect on clustering...|$|E
