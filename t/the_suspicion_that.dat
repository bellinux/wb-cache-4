5|$|The {{immediate}} effect of Peterloo was {{a crackdown on}} reform. The government instructed the police and courts {{to go after the}} journalists, presses and publication of the Manchester Observer. Wroe {{was arrested and charged with}} producing a seditious publication. Found guilty he was sentenced to twelve months in prison and fined £100. Outstanding court cases against the Manchester Observer were rushed through the courts and a continual change of sub-editors was not sufficient defence against a series of police raids, often on <b>the</b> <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> someone was writing a radical article. The Manchester Observer closed in February 1820.|$|E

5|$|Also {{hidden from}} {{scrutiny}} was the growing antagonism between the Khmer Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies. The radical {{leadership of the}} party could never escape <b>the</b> <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master. The Khmer Rouge were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate. After {{the signing of the}} Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to the Khmer Rouge, hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by the signing of the accords to turn their air power completely on the Khmer Rouge, this too was blamed on Hanoi. During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.|$|E
5|$|The Jurchens {{tried to}} end the siege by {{negotiating}} a peace treaty. There was some progress towards an agreement {{in the summer of}} 1232, but the assassination of the Mongol diplomat Tang Qing and his entourage by the Jurchens made further talks impossible. The Jin grew desperate. They had enlisted most of the available men in the empire to either defend Kaifeng or fight against the Mongols on the front lines. While the negotiations were ongoing, a plague was devastating the population of the city. Starvation was rampant. The supplies stored in Kaifeng were running out, even with what had been forcibly seized from people. The city's political disintegration created unfounded fears that there was an internal threat. Several residents of the city were executed on <b>the</b> <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> they were traitors.|$|E
5|$|With the SA {{out of the}} way, Heydrich began {{building}} the Gestapo into an instrument of fear. He improved his index-card system, creating categories of offenders with colour-coded cards. The Gestapo {{had the authority to}} arrest citizens on <b>the</b> <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> they might commit a crime, and the definition of a crime was at their discretion. The Gestapo Law, passed in 1936, gave police the right to act extra-legally. This led to the sweeping use of Schutzhaft—"protective custody", a euphemism for the power to imprison people without judicial proceedings. The courts were not allowed to investigate or interfere. The Gestapo was considered to be acting legally {{as long as it was}} carrying out the leadership's will. People were arrested arbitrarily, sent to concentration camps, or killed.|$|E
60|$|The orders Bob {{had given}} aroused in Ralph's mind, {{now that it}} was too late to make any objection, <b>the</b> <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> his {{pleasing}} manner had lulled. He began to see why it was he had been hurried away before George came.|$|R

5|$|Douglas's {{death at}} Verneuill was {{to weaken the}} {{position}} of his son Archibald, the 5th earl. On 12 October 1424, the king and Archibald met at Melrose Abbey ostensibly to agree the appointment of John Fogo, a monk of Melrose, to the abbacy. The meeting {{may also have been}} intended as an official acceptance of Douglas but it signalled a change in the Black Douglas predominance vis-a-vis the crown and other nobles. Important Douglas allies died in France and some of their heirs realigned with rival nobles through blood ties {{while at the same time}} Douglas experienced a loosening of allegiances in the Lothians and, with the loss of his command over Edinburgh Castle, this all served to improve James's position. Even though, James continued to retain Black Douglas support allowing him to begin a campaign of political alienation of Albany and his family. The king's rancor directed at Duke Murdoch had its roots in the past—Duke Robert was responsible for his brother David's death and neither Robert nor Murdoch exerted themselves in negotiating James's release and must have left the king with <b>the</b> <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> they held aspirations for the throne itself. Buchan's lands did not fall to the Albany Stewarts but were forfeited by the crown, Albany's father-in-law, Duncan, Earl of Lennox was imprisoned and in December the duke's main ally Alexander Stewart, 1st Earl of Mar, settled his differences with the king. An acrimonious sitting of parliament in March 1425 precipitated the arrest of Murdoch, Isabella, his wife, and his son Alexander—of Albany's other sons Walter was already in prison and James, his youngest, also known as James the Fat, escaped into the Lennox.|$|E

He was armed only with a heavy cudgel, and thought Dormay was defenceless.|$|R

50|$|Valera was {{a special}} case in those times: a bilingual mestizo and well-educated.

25|$|The Sub-Committee {{concluded}} {{there should}} be further and extensive investigation into the culprits and claims that British forces colluded with the bombers.

25|$|It is {{believed}} that during his rule, Banda accumulated at least US$320million in personal assets, thought to be invested in everything from agriculture to mining interests in South Africa.

One of the grandchildren graduated from law school and left for the US, while the other remains in South Africa.|$|E
50|$|During September and October 1939, Sas {{obtained}} more {{signals that}} the neutrality of the Netherlands would not remain inviolate.

Ludwig {{was a very strong}} swimmer in his youth, the water was approximately waist-deep where his body was found, and he had not expressed suicidal feelings during the crisis. Gudden's body showed blows to the head and neck and signs of strangulation, leading to <b>the</b> <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> he was strangled, although there is no more evidence to prove this.|$|E
25|$|On 4 August 1686 the Portuguese {{soldiers}} {{in the service of}} the East India Company deputed to serve in the war in Bengal refused to embark on their journey under <b>the</b> <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> the factors actually intended to send them to revive an abandoned settlement in West Sumatra which had fallen to a mysterious epidemic. When the authorities tried to force them, a mutiny broke out. The administration responded by arresting the ringleaders and executing them. The rebellion eventually subsided within a few days.|$|E

He showed up at the National Assembly hall on the next day with <b>the</b> <b>suspicion</b> <b>that</b> he had already destroyed important evidence.

5000|$|Local {{legends of}} the city of Pontevedra (Galicia) relate the {{foundation}} of this city to Teucer (Teucro), although this seems to be based more on <b>the</b> <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> Greek traders might have arrived to that area in ancient times - hence introducing a number of Greek stories.
