25|$|As {{a remedy}} to tort, {{injunctions}} are {{most commonly used}} in cases of Nuisance. The court may impose an injunction on a <b>tortfeasor,</b> such as in Sturges v Bridgman.

Injunctions may be used instead of or {{as well as the}} awarding of damages (above).|$|E
25|$|The {{person who}} commits {{the act is}} called a <b>tortfeasor.</b> Although crimes may be torts, the cause of legal action is not {{necessarily}} a crime, as the harm may be due to negligence which does not amount to criminal negligence. The victim of the harm can recover their loss as damages in a lawsuit. In order to prevail, the plaintiff in the lawsuit, commonly referred to as the injured party, must show that the actions or lack of action was the legally recognizable cause of the harm. The equivalent of tort in civil law jurisdictions is delict.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{otherwise}} {{provided by}} the act or by the contract, the compensation shall {{be limited to the}} injury actually suffered and the interests which have been lost. Interests which could have been normally expected are deemed to be the interests which have been lost, according to the ordinary course of things, the decided projects, equipment, or other particular circumstances. A person who has wrongfully caused the death of another shall also be bound to make compensation for the injury to any person incurring the medical expenses, increasing the need in living, or incurring the funeral expenses. If the deceased was statutorily bound to furnish maintenance to a third party, the <b>tortfeasor</b> shall also make compensation to such third party for any injury arising therefrom. In case of death caused by a wrongful act, the father, mother, sons, daughters and spouse of the deceased may claim for a reasonable compensation in money even if such injury is not a purely pecuniary loss.|$|E

50|$|The UCFA {{seeks to}} {{establish}} an apportionment of liability that is more flexible than the all-or-nothing approaches of the contributory negligence and last clear chance doctrines.

The relationship between comparative negligence, joint and several liability, and contribution among joint <b>tortfeasors</b> is discussed.

25|$|As can be noted, {{liability}} {{is generally}} not extended to the acts of independent contractors. Though such a distinction has been criticised, there are several circumstances in which an employer may be liable for the acts of contractors. If an employer commissions a tort, this will render the employer a joint <b>tortfeasor.</b> Additionally, where an employer is negligent in selecting a competent third party contractor, liability may be imposed. The broadest exception however is where a non-delegable duty is imposed upon an employer, either by statute or through common law, to prevent the harm of others. Where a duty is imposed by statute, either to carry out work in a certain way, or to take due care in carrying out work, then this is non-delegable. Common law duties may arise in several exceptional circumstances. One such is where an activity is being undertaken which is especially hazardous, and involves obvious risks of damage. This duty was recognised in Honeywill and Stein Ltd v Larkin Brothers Ltd, where photographers who negligently photographed {{the interior of a}} theatre set alight to the building. Their employers were found vicariously liable, as the dangerous methods of photography created a fire hazard. Additionally, where work is being undertaken on a highway, a non-delegable duty is created not to endanger any road users. Lastly, occupiers are liable in full where an independent contractor, through negligence, allows fire to spread to neighbouring land.|$|E

The case redefined {{the type of}} [...] "malice" [...] needed to sustain a libel case. Common law malice consisted of [...] "ill-will" [...] or [...] "wickedness". Now, a public officials seeking to sustain a civil action against a <b>tortfeasor</b> needed to prove by [...] "clear and convincing evidence" [...] that there was actual malice. The case involved an advertisement published in The New York Times indicating that officials in Montgomery, Alabama had acted violently in suppressing the protests of African-Americans {{during the civil rights}} movement. The Montgomery Police Commissioner, L. B. Sullivan, sued the Times for libel, stating that the advertisement damaged his reputation. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the $500,000 judgment against the Times. Justice Brennan suggested that public officials may sue for libel only if the publisher published the statements in question with [...] "actual malice"—"knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not." [...] In sum, the court held that [...] "the First Amendment protects the publication of all statements, even false ones, about the conduct of public officials except when statements are made with actual malice (with knowledge that they are false or in reckless disregard of their truth or falsity)." ...|$|E

The optimal multi-player rule is to apply the negligence rule to the most liable player (the "deep-pocket" or the "victim", defined as the player who is the most responsive to monetary incentives under the strict liability rule) and the strict liability rule to everybody else.

40|$|Reforms to the Joint and Several Liability rule (JSL) {{are one of}} {{the most}} common tort reforms and have been {{implemented}} by most US states. JSL allows plaintiffs to claim full recovery from one of the defendants, even if that defendant is only partially responsible for the tort. We develop a theoretical model that shows that the efficiency of the JSL rule depends critically on both whether the care taken by potential <b>tortfeasors</b> is observed, and on how the actions of the potential <b>tortfeasors</b> interact to cause the harm. We then provide evidence that reforms of the JSL rule have been accompanied by reductions in the accidental death rate in the U. S. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the reform of JSL causes potential <b>tortfeasors</b> to take more care. ...|$|R

50|$|An {{intervening}} cause {{is an event}} that occurs after a tortfeasor's initial act of negligence and causes injury/harm to a victim. An {{intervening cause}} will generally absolve the <b>tortfeasor</b> of liability for the victim's injury only if the event is deemed a superseding cause. A superseding cause is an unforeseeable intervening cause. By contrast, a foreseeable intervening cause typically does not break the chain of causality, meaning that the <b>tortfeasor</b> is still responsible for the victim's injury—unless the event leads to an unforeseeable result.|$|E
5000|$|This rule {{holds that}} a <b>tortfeasor</b> is liable for all {{consequences}} resulting {{from his or}} her tortious (usually negligent) activities leading to an injury to another person, even if the victim suffers an unusually high level of damage (e.g. due to a pre-existing vulnerability or medical condition). The eggshell skull rule takes into account the physical, social and economic attributes of the plaintiff which might make him more susceptible to injury. [...] It may also take into account the family and cultural environment. The term implies that if a person had a skull as delicate as that of the shell of an egg, and a <b>tortfeasor</b> who was unaware of the condition injured that person's head, causing the skull unexpectedly to break, the defendant would be held liable for all damages resulting from the wrongful contact, even if the <b>tortfeasor</b> did not intend to cause such a severe injury.|$|E

40|$|A Response to Ariel Porat, Private Production of Public Goods: Liability for Unrequested Benefits, 108 Mich. L. Rev. (2009). One of {{the more}} {{intriguing}} questions in tort law {{is the case of}} joint and several <b>tortfeasors</b> and the dilution-of-liability puzzle. When harm materializes and there are multiple potential <b>tortfeasors,</b> the law tends {{to limit the number of}} joint <b>tortfeasors,</b> focusing the final burden on a small number of actors. This limitation is achieved by several legal mechanisms, such as a no duty rule, a narrow interpretation of negligence, a restrictive implementation of the causal link (be it the but for test, the proximate cause test or the rule of intervening cause test), and a doctrine of remoteness of damage. Thus, in the typical accident example, if A, B, and C inflicted risk upon D, often times the tort system will filter out A and B and leave only C to carry the final burden. Ariel Porat 2 ̆ 7 s outline of the Expanded Duty of Restitution in his article, Private Production of Public Goods: Liability for Unrequested Benefits, provides an interesting and provocative solution to the dilution of liability puzzle...|$|R
