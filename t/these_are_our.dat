Some critics, including former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, charged that the number had been tampered with in order to benefit Obama one month before the U.S. presidential election. [...] Solis said, [...] "I'm insulted when I hear that because we have a very professional, civil service organization where you have top, top economists that work at the BLS. They've been doing these calculations. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>our</b> best trained and best-skilled individuals working in the BLS, and it's really ludicrous to hear that kind of statement." [...] For the year, the Labor Department set a record for the most back pay it had ever collected due to wage violations, $280million going to some 300,000workers. [...] Workplace fatalities in construction and general industrial sectors reached an all-time low.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the ANC's swift and decisive action towards Sparrow and other white racists, they have mostly ignored racist comments voiced by blacks, in particular ANC members. For example, Kenny Barrel Nkosi, an ANC ward councillor (Govan Mbeki Municipality, Mpumalanga) posted the following on his Facebook account: [...] "The first people that need to fokkof [...] are whites, cubans never oppressed us. <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>our</b> true friends they were there in the times on needs. welcom cdes welcome [...] " [...] The municipality issued the following statement: “The matter has been investigated {{and at the time}} of the comment, the ward councillor was not representing the views of either the ANC or the Govan Mbeki Municipality, but merely as a personal opinion.” No further action was taken.|$|E

60|$|What {{is really}} Absolute is the mystic Reason which connects both Infinites, the Holy Ghost that relates both natures of God.
