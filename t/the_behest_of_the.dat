5|$|Everton {{constructed}} covered dugouts in 1931. The {{idea was}} inspired by a visit to Pittodrie to play a friendly against Aberdeen, where such dugouts had been constructed at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dons' trainer Donald Colman. The Goodison Park dugouts were the first in England.|$|E
5|$|It was, at first, {{merely a}} folly. It {{was used as}} a summer-house, and seven {{counties}} could be seen, as now, {{from the top of the}} flagstaff tower. The triangular turreted structure was set amidst a dense plantation of trees and overlooked Virginia Water, a man-made body of water constructed by Thomas and Paul Sandby at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duke.|$|E
5|$|The {{first trip}} was at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Sunday Timess {{features}} editor Leonard Russell; the paper's chairman, Roy Thomson, enjoyed the series {{so much he}} requested Fleming undertook a second trip. The book version includes material edited out of the original articles, as well as photographs of the various cities.|$|E
2500|$|Vice-Admiral Khanykov {{reported}} to St Petersburg, in a dispatch discussed there on [...] 1796, {{that he had}} purchased Dispatch at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Catherine <b>the</b> Great, {{and that she was}} being fitted out and would be handed over to Russia.|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Suleiman <b>the</b> Magnificent the Ottoman fleet {{attacked}} and plundered Portuguese ships, fortifications and {{settlements in the}} Indian Ocean, Asia and in East Africa. The Portuguese forces were commanded by Estêvão da Gama, {{as in the previous}} war.|$|R
25|$|Le Marchant {{attained}} <b>the</b> rank <b>of</b> lieutenant-colonel in 1797. His promotion was at <b>the</b> direct <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king (Le Marchant {{lacked the}} family influence and wealth which was normally necessary for advances in rank), with whom Le Marchant {{had developed a}} friendly relationship.|$|R
5|$|With this African-centred stance, Nigeria readily sent {{troops to}} the Congo at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Nations shortly after {{independence}} (and has maintained membership since that time). Nigeria also supported several Pan African and pro-self government causes in the 1970s, including garnering support for Angola's MPLA, SWAPO in Namibia, and aiding opposition to the minority governments of Portuguese Mozambique, and Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|A {{friend of}} Edward, Prince of Wales for over 20 years, in 1891 he {{attended}} a house party at Tranby Croft, Yorkshire, where he {{took part in a}} game of baccarat at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prince. During the course of two nights' play he was accused of cheating, which he denied vehemently. After news of the affair leaked out, he sued five members of the host family for slander; the Prince of Wales was called as a witness. The case was a public spectacle, widely reported in the UK and abroad, but the judgement went against Gordon-Cumming and he was ostracised from polite society.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1991, Jashari {{participated in}} {{attacks against the}} Serbian police before {{travelling}} to Albania to receive military training. Arrested in 1993, he was released at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Albanian Army and later returned to Kosovo, where he continued launching attacks against the Yugoslav establishment. In July 1997, {{he was convicted of}} terrorism in absentia by a Yugoslav court. After several unsuccessful attempts to capture or kill him, Serbian police launched an attack against Jashari's home in Prekaz in March 1998. The battle that followed resulted in the deaths of 58 members of Jashari's family, including that of Jashari, his wife, brother and son.|$|E
25|$|At <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Mother Teresa, <b>the</b> member-sisters {{also took}} part in some {{activities}} of Asha Dhan, an institution to care for destitute women.|$|R
50|$|In 1900, at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Stoke City, <b>the</b> Football Association {{placed a}} maximum wage in its {{statutes}}. It {{was removed from}} the Football Association's statutes 1904.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> {{hostilities}} in <b>the</b> 1991 Gulf War, the Battle Damage Assessment Working Group (BDAWG) {{was formed}} at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> MTIC, <b>the</b> Military Targeting Intelligence Committee. Largely, this group sought {{to create a}} standard lexicon of terminology for describing BDA, and to develop an outlook for <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> BDA.|$|R
5|$|Erected at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Illinois General Assembly, the University of Illinois Observatory became {{important}} {{in the development of}} astronomy due, in large part, to pioneering research by Dr. Stebbins, from 1907 to 1922. Joel Stebbins left the University of Illinois in 1922 but left behind a legacy of discovery that helped alter the face of modern astronomy. The building served the University of Illinois astronomy department from its opening until 1979, when the department moved into a new, larger building to house its growing staff.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2005 {{purchase}} of the original Colross site by a real estate development company, an archaeological excavation was undertaken between March and June that year at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city of Alexandria. Archaeologists uncovered an underground domed brick cistern and evidence of slave outbuildings, {{in addition to the}} foundations of the estate's peripheral walls and several ancillary structures. The excavation of the Colross site resulted in 79 condominium buyers abandoning their purchase agreements because of the delay in construction of a luxury Monarch Condominium project.|$|E
5|$|Human rights organisations accuse {{police and}} {{military}} forces of mistreating and even torturing criminal suspects, ethnic minorities, homosexuals, and political activists. Prisons are overcrowded with little access to adequate food and medical facilities, and prisons run by traditional rulers in the north are charged with holding political opponents at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government. However, since {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, an increasing number of police and gendarmes have been prosecuted for improper conduct.|$|E
25|$|Very soon after, {{the same}} ordinaries {{assembled}} again, {{this time in}} Copenhagen (July 1936) at <b>the</b> direct <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Propaganda Fide Congregation, {{in order to continue}} their deliberations. Alas, nothing came <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ambitious plan to establish a minor seminary. The project, however, has continued to haunt the Nordic bishops' meetings over the years.|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> William I, <b>the</b> Royal Architect Charles Vander Straeten {{designed}} the monument. The engineer Jean-Baptiste Vifquain conceived {{of it as}} a symbol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allied victory rather than as glorifying any sole individual.|$|R
2500|$|Although Lohse's {{name was}} on the order, it was {{actually}} issued at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Bruno Jedicke, <b>the</b> Ordnungspolizei chief in the Baltic States. [...] Jedicke in turn was subordinate to Friedrich Jeckeln, the senior SS man in the Baltic States and Belarus.|$|R
5|$|Oliver Parker, an English {{director}} {{who had previously}} adapted An Ideal Husband by Wilde, made the 2002 film; it stars Colin Firth (Jack), Rupert Everett (Algy), Judi Dench (Lady Bracknell), Reese Witherspoon (Cecily), Frances O'Connor (Gwendolen), Anna Massey (Miss Prism), and Tom Wilkinson (Canon Chasuble). Parker's adaptation includes the dunning solicitor Mr. Gribsby who pursues Jack to Hertfordshire (present in Wilde's original draft, but cut at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play's first producer). Algernon too is pursued {{by a group of}} creditors in the opening scene.|$|E
5|$|Seoba Srba (English: Migration of the Serbs) {{is a set}} of four similar oil {{paintings}} by the Serbian artist Paja Jovanović that depict Serbs, led by Archbishop Arsenije III, fleeing Old Serbia during the Great Serb Migration of 1690–91. The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{aircraft}} had departed from U.S. soil and U.S. nationals {{had died in}} the incident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was legally required to investigate. On the morning of September 1, the NTSB chief in Alaska, James Michelangelo, received an order from the NTSB in Washington at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State Department requiring all documents relating to the NTSB investigation to be sent to Washington, and notifying him that the State Department would now conduct the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The tournament shares {{its name}} with the trophy, {{also called the}} Copa Libertadores or simply la Copa, which is awarded to the Copa Libertadores winner. It was {{designed}} by goldsmith Alberto de Gasperi, an Italian-born emigrant to Peru, in Camusso Jewelry in Lima at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> CONMEBOL. <b>The</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laurel is made of sterling silver, with <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> football player at the top (which is made of bronze with a silver coating).|$|R
500|$|Brownlee became Premier November 23, 1925, when Lieutenant Governor of Alberta William Egbert, at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UFA caucus, {{asked him}} to form a {{government}}. [...] Previously, Brownlee had been Attorney-General in <b>the</b> government <b>of</b> Herbert Greenfield. [...] Greenfield was a weak and indecisive premier, and UFA Members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Legislative Assembly (MLAs) began increasingly to look to Brownlee to leadership. [...] Though Brownlee resisted early calls to assume <b>the</b> premiership out <b>of</b> loyalty to Greenfield, he was eventually persuaded by <b>the</b> advice <b>of</b> UFA President Henry Wise Wood and Greenfield's assurances that he would happily step aside in Brownlee's favour.|$|R
50|$|During {{the years}} 1985-90, Sri Ramana and Sri Bapu made videos for school {{subjects}} for children on television. At <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> then <b>the</b> chief minister <b>of</b> Andhra Pradesh Dr. N.T RamaRao, Bapu-Ramana made these education videos which were aired by Doordarshan in Telugu were very popular. The same were later dubbed and aired by National Doordarshan. A.R. Rahaman, {{the present day}} music maestro, was then an upcoming drummer, providing background music for few of these videos.|$|R
5|$|The Philadelphia Mint coined 1,000,528 of {{the half}} dollars at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commission in May and June 1926, with the excess over the {{authorized}} mintage reserved for inspection and testing at the 1927 meeting of the United States Assay Commission. They also had the mint strike 200,226 quarter eagles in May and June, with the excess also {{set aside for the}} Assay Commission. The gold piece was the second quarter eagle to be a commemorative, after the Panama–Pacific issue of 1915. No further gold commemoratives, of any denomination, would be issued by the Mint Bureau until 1984, when a $10 piece was issued for the Los Angeles Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The monastery {{was founded}} by Merek Lama Lodre Gyamsto in 1680-81 at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 5th Dalai Lama, who was his contemporary. When Merek Lama was {{experiencing}} difficulties in building the monastery at the chosen location of Tsosum, the ancient name for Tawang, the 5th Dalai Lama issued directives {{to the people of}} the area to provide him all help. To fix the perimeter of the Dzong, the Dalai Lama had also given a ball of yarn, the length of which was to form the limit of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|While Roman {{emperors}} {{almost always}} married wives {{who were also}} Roman citizens, the ruling families of the empire's client kingdoms in the Near East and North Africa often contracted marriages with other royal houses to consolidate their position. These marriages were often contracted with the approval, or even at <b>the</b> <b>behest,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman emperors themselves. Rome thought that such marriages promoted stability among their client states and prevented petty local wars that would disturb the Pax Romana. Glaphyra of Cappadocia was known to have contracted three such royal intermarriages: with Juba II, King of Numidia and Mauretania, Alexander of Judea and Herod Archelaus, Ethnarch of Samaria.|$|E
5|$|When Sugriva {{challenges}} Vali to a duel, Tara wisely advises Vali not {{to accept}} because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former's alliance with Rama—the hero <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ramayana and an avatar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> god Vishnu—but Vali does not heed her, and dies from Rama's arrow, shot at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Sugriva. <b>The</b> Ramayana and its later adaptations emphasize Tara's lamentation. While in most vernacular versions, Tara casts a curse on Rama by <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> her chastity, in some versions, Rama enlightens Tara.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> plea <b>of</b> P.K Deo that Kalahandi Assembly {{has already}} {{unanimously}} passed resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> merger with the Eastern States Union {{rather than with}} Orissa was bluntly ignored at Cuttack Darbar in December 1947 which was attended by Sardar Patel and V.P Menon at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> H.K Mahatab, <b>the</b> then Orissa Premier.|$|R
5|$|During the 1970s and 1980s Tange {{expanded}} his portfolio to include buildings in over 20countries around the world. In 1985, at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Jacques Chirac, <b>the</b> mayor <b>of</b> Paris at that time, Tange proposed {{a master plan}} for a plaza at Place d'Italie that would interconnect the city along an east-west axis.|$|R
5|$|With Saltimbanco {{finished}} and touring in the United States and Canada, Cirque du Soleil toured Japan {{in the summer}} of 1992 at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fuji Television Network. Taking acts from Nouvelle Expérience and Cirque Réinventé, they created a show for this tour, titled Fascination. Although Fascination was never seen outside Japan, it represented the first time that Cirque du Soleil had produced a show that took place in an arena rather than a big top. It was also the first that Cirque du Soleil performed outside of North America.|$|E
5|$|Despite Venice's {{economic}} and maritime decline, in 1601 at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Doge Marino Grimani, the Venetian Senate {{decided to have}} a new bucentaur built at the cost of 70,000 ducats; although the existing one was still in service, experts regarded it as too old. The designer of the new ship is unknown, but he was selected from among the most qualified marangoni (ships' carpenters) of the Arsenale. The work was supervised by Marco Antonio Memmo, the sovraprovveditore (overseer of the provveditore) of the Arsenale. The new vessel was approved and praised by all on its maiden voyage to the Lido with the newly elected Doge Leonardo Donato on Ascension Day, 10 May 1606.|$|E
5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E
50|$|Having ceded his territories in the Danube region, Svyatoslav {{began to}} return to Kiev. Although he had been defeated, new Byzantine Emperor John I Tzimiskes (who had assassinated and overthrown Phokas) worried that the peace treaty he had forced Svyatoslav to sign between the Empire and Rus' would not last. Therefore, at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Byzantium, <b>the</b> Pechenegs (led by Kurya) ambushed Svyatoslav and his army when he {{attempted}} to cross the cataracts near Khortitsa, at the Dnieper River, in March 972. His army took heavy losses, and the king himself was slain.|$|R

50|$|After <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Actium 31 BC, the Armenian {{king was}} {{executed}} by beheading at <b>the</b> <b>behest</b> <b>of</b> Cleopatra.

She sent his head to Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene to secure his help.|$|R
