25|$|Long-term {{success rates}} of {{treatment}} have seldom been evaluated. However, experienced clinicians acknowledge that DSPD {{is extremely difficult}} to treat. One study of 61 DSPD patients, with average sleep onset at about 3 a.m. and average waking time of about 11:30a.m., was followed with questionnaires <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> after a year. Good effect was seen during the six-week treatment with a large daily dose of melatonin. Follow-up showed that over 90% had relapsed to pre-treatment sleeping patterns within the year, 29% reporting that the relapse occurred within one week. The mild cases retained changes significantly longer than the severe cases.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 {{researchers}} from UC Berkeley published a study reporting second-by-second reconstruction of videos watched by the study's subjects, from fMRI data. This {{was achieved by}} creating a statistical model relating visual patterns in videos shown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects,</b> to the brain activity caused by watching the videos. This model was then used to look up the 100 one-second video segments, in a database of 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos, whose visual patterns most closely matched the brain activity recorded when subjects watched a new video. These 100 one-second video extracts were then combined into a mashed-up image that resembled the video being watched.|$|E

25|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1960-1961 {{in the wake}} of the Great Smog of 1952 compared 293 London residents with 477 residents of Gloucester, Peterborough, and Norwich, three towns with low reported death rates from chronic bronchitis. All subjects were male postal truck drivers aged 40 to 59. Compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> from the outlying towns, the London subjects exhibited more severe respiratory symptoms (including cough, phlegm, and dyspnea), reduced lung function (FEV1 and peak flow rate), and increased sputum production and purulence. The differences were more pronounced for subjects aged 50 to 59. The study controlled for age and smoking habits, so concluded that air pollution was the most likely cause of the observed differences.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, with Germany’s {{invasion}} of France looming, Miró relocated to Varengeville in Normandy, and on 20 May {{of the following}} year, as Germans invaded Paris, he narrowly fled to Spain (now controlled by Francisco Franco) {{for the duration of}} the Vichy Regime’s rule. In Varengeville, Palma, and Mont-roig, between 1940 and 1941, Miró created the twenty-three gouache series Constellations. Revolving around celestial symbolism, Constellations earned the artist praise from André Breton, who seventeen years later wrote a series of poems, named after and inspired by Miró's series. Features of this work revealed a shifting focus <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> of women, birds, and the moon, which would dominate his iconography for much of the rest of his career.|$|E
25|$|Kane {{set out on}} his own on June 17, 1845, {{travelling}} {{along the}} northern shores of the Great Lakes, visiting first the Saugeen reservation. After weeks of sketching, he reached Sault Ste. Marie between Lake Superior and Lake Huron in summer 1845. He had intended to travel further west, but John Ballenden, an experienced officer of the Hudson's Bay Company stationed at Sault Ste. Marie, told him of the many difficulties and perils of travelling alone through the western territories and advised Kane to attempt such a feat only {{with the support of the}} company. After the Hudson's Bay Company had taken over its competitor, the North West Company of Montreal, in 1821, the whole territory west of the Great Lakes until the Pacific Ocean and the Oregon Country was Hudson's Bay land, a largely uncharted wilderness with about a hundred isolated outposts of the company along the major fur trade routes. Kane returned to Toronto for the winter, elaborating his field sketches to oil canvases, and in spring of the next year, he went to the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company at Lachine (today part of Montreal) and asked company governor George Simpson for support for his travel plans. Simpson was impressed by Kane's artistic ability, but at the same time worried that Kane might not have the stamina needed to travel with the fur brigades of the company. He granted Kane passage on company canoes only as far as Lake Winnipeg, with the promise of full passage if the artist did well until then. At the same time, he commissioned Kane to do paintings of Indian lifestyle for him, with some very detailed instructions as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects.</b>|$|E

[...] He has, however, come into his own way of illustration, drawing the common man on the streets with bold strokes in pen and ink. [...] A trademark of his Malay characters is their three-loop noses. [...] Lat paid attention to family life and children because of his idolisation of Raja Hamzah, a senior cartoonist who was also popular in the 1960s with his comics about swashbuckling heroes. [...] Rejabhad, a well-respected cartoonist, was Lat's mentor, and imbued the junior cartoonist with a preference to be sensitive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> of his works.

500|$|In [...] "To a Husband", Angelou {{praises the}} Black slaves who helped in the {{development}} and growth of America. [...] She idealizes Black men, especially in [...] "A Zorro Man" [...] and [...] "To a Man"; she dedicates Diiie <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> of both poems. [...] DeGout views [...] "A Zorro Man" [...] as an example of Angelou's ability to translate her personal experience into political discourse and the [...] "textured liberation" [...] she places in all her poetry. [...] The use of concrete imagery and abstract symbolism to describe emotional and sexual experience, but also has another meaning, that of liberation from painful and poignant memories. [...] According to DeGout, [...] "A Zorro Man" [...] lacks the clear themes of liberation that Angelou's later poems such as [...] "Phenomenal Woman" [...] have, but its subtle use of themes and techniques infer the liberation theme and compliment her poems that are more overtly liberating. [...] The poem and others in Diiie, with its focus on women's sexual and romantic experiences, challenges the gender codes of poetry written in previous eras. [...] She also challenges the male-centered and militaristic themes and messages found in the poetry of the Black Arts movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. [...] Angelou's use of sexual imagery, from a woman's point of view, provides new interpretations" [...] and excavates it from derogatory assessments". [...] Although the poem's speaker feels trapped, women's sexuality is depicted as powerful and controls her partner, which moves away from [...] "the patriarchal assumption of male control over the sexual act". [...] Angelou's depiction allows her readers, mostly women, to identify, celebrate, and universalize their sexuality to all races. [...] DeGout states that [...] "A Zorro Man" [...] "enact empowerment by liberating the reader from stigmas placed on women's sexuality from gender assumptions of male (sexual) power, and from racialized notions of women's experience".|$|E
