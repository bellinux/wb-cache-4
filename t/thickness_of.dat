The <b>thicknesses</b> <b>of</b> colloidal crystal multilayers increased with the particle concentration increasing within a certain range of particles concentrations. When the particle concentration exceeded 2. 48 wt%, the <b>thicknesses</b> <b>of</b> colloidal crystal multilayers didn’t increased with the concentration increasing. Colloidal crystal multilayers with few defects could be deposited from the suspensions with the particle concentration 2. 48 wt%. The optical properties of the silica colloidal multilayers were investigated by a UV-Vis scanning spectrophotometer in normal incidence.

METHODS: Through randomly selecting 30 cases(60 eyes) of anisometropic amblyopic children as test group and 29 cases(58 eyes) of children with normal vision after the vision correction as control group, the changes <b>of</b> the retinal <b>thicknesses</b> <b>of</b> macular of the test group and the control group at Area A 1 by OCT- 3 was observed dynamically and analyzed. RESULTS:Compared with first diagnosis, the comparative difference <b>of</b> retinal <b>thicknesses</b> <b>of</b> macular at Area A 1 in control group at 3, 6 mo has statistical significance. The test group was divided into amblyopia group and non-amblyopia group. There has statistical significance for the comparative difference between the retinal <b>thicknesses</b> <b>of</b> macular centre at 3, 6 mo and the first diagnosis in the non-amblyopia group, the amblyopia group was divided into the invalid cure group, progress group and the cured group according to amblyopic cure effect. Compared with first diagnosis, there is no statistical significance of macular at Area A 1 in invalid cure group and progress group at 3, 6 mo, and in the cured group at 3 mo, but in the cured group at 6 mo has statistical significance. CONCLUSION: There is a certain relationship between the changes <b>of</b> retinal <b>thicknesses</b> <b>of</b> macular of children with anisometropic amblyopic at Area A 1 before {{and at the end}} of amblyopia treatment and amblyopia cure effect. OCT is a kind of objective auxiliary test method and provides new clues for amblyopia research...|$|R
