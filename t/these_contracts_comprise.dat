40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of a larger body of {{research}} being undertaken by Dr. Fiona Murray and colleagues examining value creation and sharing between and among the three principal players in the commercialization of academic biomedical research: universities, biotech firms, and big pharma. The Recombinant Capital database provided access to contracts for biomedical technology licensed from academe to biotech, and also subsequent contracts that included that same technology from biotech to big pharma. <b>These</b> two <b>contracts</b> <b>comprise</b> a <b>contract</b> "pair". Importantly, <b>these</b> <b>contract</b> "pairs" were unredacted, that is., all parts of the contracts, including the commercial terms, were available. This thesis will lay the foundation for later work by examining the contracts between university and biotech, from the University's point of view. The goal is to identify factors that give the university more power in a pricing negotiation, and that predict higher economic value for the contract. The Specific Aim is to determine if certain University factors have a significant effect on predicting the economic value of the university-biotech licensing agreement. Four groups of readily quantifiable factors that contain attributes that might add power to the University in its pricing negotiation with the Biotech firm were identified: Institutional factors, Single Inventor factors, Aggregate factors, and Invention factors. The hypothesis is that at least one of these factors will have a significant effect on predicting the value of the licensing agreement, as determined using ordinary- and multiple-linear regression models. In formulistic terms, the null- and test-hypotheses are: (HO) no factor has a significant effect on predicting economic value, and (HI) at least one(cont.) one factor has a significant effect on predicting economic value. A multiple regression model of the factors as explanatory variables for the economic value of the license revealed that two independent university factors significantly predict economic value of the <b>contract.</b> <b>These</b> combined factors account for 64 % of the variance of the dependent variable (in excess of control), and have coefficients that are significant (p < 0. 001). The results are discussed in the context of its importance to university technology transfer officers, biotech firms and venture capitalists. by Richard George Wehby. Thesis (S. M.)

This paper presents a methodology for simulating {{the performance of}} hedging strategies for financial contracts with embedded optimization features. As a case study, we provide simulations of mutual fund guarantees o#ering a reset provision. In Canada, <b>these</b> types of <b>contracts</b> are known as segregated funds. The optimization component of <b>these</b> <b>contracts</b> is that the holder can choose when to lock in market gains, typically up to two or four times per calendar year.

40|$|Drivers {{account for}} up to 80 % of the {{operational}} cost of transit agencies. This dissertation provides a method for improving the productivity of this workforce by introducing flexible <b>contracts.</b> Under <b>these</b> <b>contracts</b> drivers do not work {{the same number of}} hours every day. However, the number days and hours worked every week are kept constant. <b>These</b> <b>contracts</b> allow the agency to find a better match between the number of drivers needed and hired. Since people's preferences vary, introducing this flexibility should benefit both the agency and the drivers. Driver contracts are offered simultaneously to all drivers. Because drivers may be absent to work unexpectedly, <b>these</b> <b>contracts</b> must be designed to overstaff the system. However, current methodologies to determine <b>these</b> <b>contracts</b> fail to incorporate this uncertainty. There is also a lack of understanding as to how parameters of the problem such as driver wage, and the likelihood of absenteeism will impact the total cost. This dissertation aims to fill this gap. The methodology introduced here considers absenteeism, and provides cost sensitivities. Further cost savings can be achieved if <b>these</b> <b>contracts</b> are synchronized with the trips operated by the agency. To achieve this goal, this dissertation extends the contract scheduling work and investigates the opposite problem where contracts are given and timetables must be identified. Two different methodologies are used to study this timetable design problem: continuum approximation and numerical optimization. The continuum approximation work incorporates uncertainties and provides cost sensitivities. The numerical optimization approach is used to validate the approximated results. In the latter work cuts are designed to solve an otherwise intractable problem. These cuts are also valid for the production lot-sizing problem...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to analyse}} whether contracts made by electronic agents 1 might be made enforceable under Islamic law. It discusses what constitutes an enforceable contract under Islamic law and whether this is applicable when a contract is made by an electronic agent. The enforceability of <b>these</b> <b>contracts</b> under Islamic law is especially important in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) where Islamic law constitutes the legal system. Ignoring the doctrine of Islamic law {{in relation to the}} enforceability of <b>these</b> <b>contracts</b> could, therefore, fundamentally affect the future viability of <b>these</b> <b>contracts</b> in the KSA. The dissertation argues first that the principle of mutual consent under Islamic law is not satisfied in contracts made by electronic agents because there is no communication of an offer and acceptance by the contracting parties (users). Secondly, while electronic agents function like human agents, {{there are a number of}} doctrinal requirements under Islamic agency theory that prevent electronic agents from being agents proper. Thirdly, the term ‘legal personality’ is categorised in Islamic law under ‘Dhimmah’, an ethical concept designed principally for human beings which cannot, therefore, be attributed to electronic agents. This dissertation demonstrates that Islamic law creates conceptual obstacles which prevent contracts made by electronic agents being enforceable in the KSA. One implication of this will be a risk of negative impact on the development of <b>these</b> <b>contracts</b> in the KSA because they are contradictory to Islamic law. Islamic law must avoid narrow traditional interpretations of its legal concepts, because a lack of reform in this area will create difficulties and barriers against the enforceability of <b>these</b> <b>contracts</b> under Islamic law...|$|R
