He also set three days of national mourning, from March 31 to April 2. Daniel Scioli, governor of the Buenos Aires Province (birthplace of Alfonsín), also announced a provincial mourning. Almost a thousand people attended, and at some moments <b>they</b> <b>sang</b> the Argentine National Anthem.|$|E
5|$|Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Lloyd George, {{as well as}} future Prime Minister Winston Churchill were in {{attendance}} for the match. The press billed the match as England versus Wales, and noted that the Welsh fans included high numbers of woman as well as mothers with babies. There were special trains laid on for the Cardiff fans, which began arriving at Paddington train station from 4am onwards. The Metropolitan Railway put on additional trains to commute fans from Baker Street station to Wembley Park; one every two minutes. Between 11am to kick off, 30,000 fans per hour travelled this route; some 100,000 fans were expected {{to arrive at the}} ground. The Welsh fans made special excursions across London; some travelled to St. Paul's Cathedral, where <b>they</b> <b>sang</b> Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau. Other fans went to The Cenotaph, Whitehall, where they dressed it in Welsh colours to honour the veterans of the First World War.|$|E
25|$|Each week, contestants chose {{a song to}} {{a weekly}} theme on the Sunday night. (As the number of contestants got smaller, <b>they</b> <b>sang</b> two or three songs each). As in the semi-finals, each {{performance}} was critiqued by the judges, {{and then there was}} (approximately) 24 hours of voting by phone or SMS, before the results were announced on the Monday night. The eliminated competitor(s) then presented a final song – usually the number <b>they</b> <b>sang</b> the previous night.|$|E

50|$|Another major {{characteristic}} of this band is that <b>they</b> <b>sing</b> in English. The {{reason for this}} choice, they argue, is that each language has a specific style and that the music <b>they</b> <b>sing</b> would not work with the Spanish language.|$|R
25|$|The girl group, The Cookies, sang as backing singers {{for various}} artists {{including}} Kush and Linda George (<b>they</b> <b>sang</b> at {{three of the}} four festivals).|$|E

25|$|When <b>they</b> <b>sing</b> Lauds at Hagia Sophia, <b>they</b> <b>sing</b> {{first in}} the narthex before the royal doors; then <b>they</b> enter to <b>sing</b> {{in the middle of}} the church; then the gates of Paradise are opened and <b>they</b> <b>sing</b> a third time before the altar. On Sundays and feastdays the Patriarch assists at Lauds and at the Liturgy; at this time he blesses the singers from gallery, and ceasing to <b>sing,</b> <b>they</b> {{proclaim}} the polychronia; then <b>they</b> begin to <b>sing</b> again as harmoniously and as sweetly as the angels, and <b>they</b> <b>sing</b> in this fashion until the Liturgy. After Lauds they put off their vestments and go out to receive the blessing of the Patriarch; then the preliminary lessons are read in the ambo; when these are over the Liturgy begins, and at the end of the service the chief priest recites the so-called prayer of the ambo within the sanctuary while the second priest recites in the church, beyond the ambo; when they have finished the prayer, both bless the people. Vespers are said in the same fashion, beginning at an early hour.|$|R

25|$|This {{tradition}} {{had been}} established over many years. When Henry Willis was Director of Music at Methody from 1957–66, large scale choral works were undertaken by the Senior School, which continued under William McCay. Dr Joe McKee OBE was Director of Music from 1991 to 2002, and he arranged for the Senior Chorus to sing in public performances outside the College. With the Director of Music, Ruth McCartney MBE, the Senior Chorus learned one large-scale choral work each year, starting in September. The Senior Chorus performed on three occasions in the school year: Senior Prize Distribution, College Carols, and the Easter Concert. At the Senior Prize Distribution in October, <b>they</b> <b>sang</b> two movements from the choral work, {{as well as a}}nother popular tune. At the College Carols, in December, <b>they</b> <b>sang</b> two movements from the choral work, as well as a Christmas piece. The Easter Concert was the most important event in the Senior Chorus calendar; {{in the second half of}} the concert, <b>they</b> <b>sang</b> the entire choral work, followed by a popular tune. At Senior Prize Distribution and the College Carols, they were accompanied by the Senior Orchestra, and at the Easter Concert they were accompanied by the Easter Concert Orchestra, made up of some members of the Senior Orchestra along with other guests.|$|E
25|$|Episodes 5–8, (Cycle 2) were edited {{together}} to make The Pirates and the Prince (which was previously released on VHS in 1996). Along with other changes to the soundtrack, Sy Snootles and the Max Rebo Band are seen singing a different song than <b>they</b> <b>sang</b> in the original series.|$|E
25|$|By {{order of}} the Indonesian government, Sukumaran was {{executed}} by firing squad on 29 April 2015 at 12:25am WITA along with Chan and six other prisoners (four Nigerians, a Brazilian and an Indonesian).

50|$|The {{competitors}} are split in groups and <b>they</b> <b>sing</b> solo (like {{in the previous}} round). After that the jury decides who will continue. After that the remaining contestants sing in quartets and the jury picks the best of them. Then <b>they</b> <b>sing</b> solo and the jury picks 18 people for the semi-finals.|$|R
5000|$|The Michael Cera/Ellen Page {{cover of}} [...] "Anyone Else but You" [...] was {{recorded}} {{on the last}} day of filming on the streets of Vancouver.

60|$|The Russian peasant, when he rises, {{will prove}} more terrible, more pitiless {{than were the}} men of 1790. He is less intelligent, more brutal. <b>They</b> <b>sing</b> a wild, sad song, these Russian cattle, the while <b>they</b> work. <b>They</b> <b>sing</b> it in chorus on the quays while hauling the cargo, <b>they</b> <b>sing</b> it in the factory, they chant on the weary, endless steppes, reaping the corn they may not eat. It is of the good time their masters are having, of the feastings and the merrymakings, of the {{laughter}} of the children, of the kisses of the lovers.|$|R
25|$|By August 1898 she was {{receiving}} offers from English managers of comic opera. The Belle of New York was staged at the Shaftesbury Theatre with Harry Davenport in the company. Davenport portrayed {{a doctor and}} Rankin, a housekeeper, in Three Wise Fools. The two met and married in the original production of The Belle of New York. In the musical <b>they</b> <b>sang</b> a famous duet, When We Are Married.|$|E
25|$|The Muisca were polytheistic {{and their}} {{religion}} and mythology was closely {{connected with the}} natural area they were inhabiting. They had {{a thorough understanding of}} astronomical parameters and developed a complex luni-solar calendar; the Muisca calendar. According to the calendar they had specific times for sowing, harvest and the organisation of festivals where <b>they</b> <b>sang,</b> danced and played music and drank their national drink chicha in great quantities.|$|E

25|$|Although {{members of}} the jazz {{community}} initially felt that a Jewish piano player and a white novelist could not adequately convey the plight of blacks in a 1930s Charleston ghetto, jazz musicians warmed up more to the opera after twenty years, and more jazz-based recordings of it began to appear. Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald recorded an album in 1957 in which <b>they</b> <b>sang</b> and scatted Gershwin's tunes. The next year, Miles Davis recorded what some consider a seminal interpretation of the opera arranged for big band.|$|E
25|$|The {{community}} was not neglectful of matters pertaining to art and culture. Frederick Rapp purchased artifacts and installed a museum containing fine paintings and many curiosities and antiques, but {{it proved to}} be unprofitable and was sold at a loss. In addition, the Harmonists maintained a deer park, a floral park, and a maze, or labyrinth. The Harmonists were fond of music and many of the members were accomplished musicians. <b>They</b> <b>sang,</b> had a band/orchestra, composed songs, and gave much attention to its cultivation. By 1830 they had amassed a 360-volume library.|$|E

Wells {{and directed by}} Ivor Montagu (Bluebottles, Daydreams and The Tonic) in which Laughton made brief appearances. They also appeared together in a 1930 'film revue' entitled Comets, featuring British stage, musical and variety acts, in which <b>they</b> <b>sang</b> in duet 'The Ballad of Frankie and Johnnie.' Lanchester appeared in several other early British talkies, including Potiphar's Wife (1931), a film starring Laurence Olivier.|$|E

25|$|The band’s {{following}} {{release was}} a 7-inch vinyl called Life Transmission (also known as Útfrymi), which was released {{through their own}} label, Eskvímó in 1981. It contained two songs: the title song, {{which was the first}} work <b>they</b> <b>sang</b> in English, and “Heima er Bezt”. Later, they collaborated on the soundtrack to Brennu-Njálssaga, a film about the Njáls saga which was directed by Friðrik Þór Friðriksson, toured Iceland and played along with Þursaflokkurinn and Baraflokkurinn in Akureyri. After these concerts, they went back to the recording studio and prepared Iður til Fóta, a 10-inch vinyl single which contained four tracks.|$|E
25|$|Labelle {{signed with}} the Warner Music imprint, Track Records, and {{released}} their self-titled debut album in 1971. The record's psychedelic soul sound and its blending of rock and soul rhythms was {{a departure from the}} group's early sound. That same year, <b>they</b> <b>sang</b> background vocals on Laura Nyro's album, Gonna Take a Miracle. A year later, in 1972, the group released Moon Shadow, which repeated the homegrown gritty sound of the previous album. In 1973, influenced by glam rockers David Bowie and Elton John, Wickham had the group dressed in silver space suits and luminescent makeup.|$|E
25|$|White Spanish and Cuban criollos saw cabildos as a {{necessary}} evil. By the 18th century, these spaces of cultural autonomy and support began to worry slaves' white masters. Articles of the 1792 Bando de Buen Gobierno y Policia address the necessity of controlling the cabildos and their members. Neighbors often complained about the unpleasant noises made by the slaves as <b>they</b> <b>sang</b> and played African instruments. By the 19th century, cabildos were re-located outside {{the walls of the}} city of Havana so that whites would not have to see or hear their African celebrations. For the Afro-Cubans, this expulsion added a degree of privacy that they had previously lacked.|$|E
