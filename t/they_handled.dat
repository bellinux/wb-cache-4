5|$|A {{delegation}} of landowners presented the ORD Real Estate Branch with a petition protesting {{the acquisition of}} their property on 23 November 1942, and that night over 200 landowners held a meeting at which they agreed to hire lawyers and appraisers to challenge the Federal government. Local newspapers and politicians were sympathetic to their cause. By the end of May 1943, agreements were reached covering 416 tracts totaling , but some landowners rejected the government's offers. The ORD Real Estate Branch invoked a procedure under Tennessee law that allowed for a jury of five citizens appointed by the Federal District Court to review the compensation offered. <b>They</b> <b>handled</b> five cases in which they proposed higher values {{than those of the}} ORD appraisers, but the landowners rejected them as well, so the Army discontinued the use of this method. In response to rising public criticism, O'Brien commissioned a review by the Department of Agriculture. It found that the appraisals had been fair and just, and that farmers had overestimated the size and productivity of their land.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the threat}} from Iselle, {{lieutenant}} governor candidate Warner Sutton requested that Governor Neil Abercrombie postpone the August9 primary. The governor declined the request, and the primary election occurred as scheduled. However, the storm damaged roads leading to two polling stations on the Big Island, prompting officials to decide the election by absentee ballot in those areas. After a close campaign between incumbent Senator Brian Schatz and Congresswoman Colleen Hanabusa, the senate primary, held {{on the same day}} as the gubernatorial primary, was too close to call after Schatz led by only 1,635votes. As a result, the election hinged on the two closed polling stations, where more than 8,000people had the option to vote by mail. This was later changed to an in-person vote for August15, despite a challenge from the Hanabusa campaign with regards to storm damage, and Schatz ultimately won. The Hawaii American Civil Liberties Union later sued the state over how <b>they</b> <b>handled</b> the election.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{opened a}} law {{practice}} in Columbia City in 1876, taking on many minor cases. After gaining prominence, he accepted William F. McNagny {{as a partner}} in 1879 and began taking many criminal defense cases. The two men functioned well as partners. McNagny was better educated in law and worked out their legal arguments. Marshall, the superior orator, argued the cases before the judge and jury. Their firm became well known in the region after <b>they</b> <b>handled</b> a number of high-profile cases. In 1880 Marshall ran for public office {{for the first time as}} the Democratic candidate for his district's prosecuting attorney. The district was a Republican stronghold, and he was defeated. About the same time, he met and began to court Kate Hooper, and the two became engaged to marry. Kate died of an illness in 1882, one day before they were to be wed. Her death was a major emotional blow to Marshall, leading him to become an alcoholic.|$|E
5|$|To {{counteract}} {{the power of}} the Imperial Household Department and the Manchu nobility, in July 1653 the Shunzhi Emperor established the Thirteen Offices (十三衙門), or Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus, which were supervised by Manchus, but manned by Chinese eunuchs rather than Manchu bondservants. Eunuchs had been kept under tight control during Dorgon's regency, but the young emperor used them to counter the influence of other power centers such as his mother the Empress Dowager and former regent Jirgalang. By the late 1650s eunuch power became formidable again: <b>they</b> <b>handled</b> key financial and political matters, offered advice on official appointments, and even composed edicts. Because eunuchs isolated the monarch from the bureaucracy, Manchu and Chinese officials feared a return to the abuses of eunuch power that had plagued the late Ming. Despite the emperor's attempt to impose strictures on eunuch activities, the Shunzhi Emperor's favorite eunuch Wu Liangfu (吳良輔; d. 1661), who had helped him defeat the Dorgon faction in the early 1650s, was caught in a corruption scandal in 1658. The fact that Wu only received a reprimand for his accepting bribes did not reassure the Manchu elite, which saw eunuch power as a degradation of Manchu power. The Thirteen Offices would be eliminated (and Wu Liangfu executed) by Oboi and the other regents of the Kangxi Emperor in March 1661 soon after the Shunzhi Emperor's death.|$|E

25|$|Two British trading {{companies}} based in England operated the slave castle at Bunce Island (formerly called Bance Island), {{located in the}} Sierra Leone River. Henry Laurens was their agent in Charleston and was a planter and slave trader. His counterpart in England was the Scottish merchant and slave trader Richard Oswald. Many of the enslaved Africans taken in West Africa were processed through Bunce Island. It was a prime export site for slaves to South Carolina and Georgia.

The sensor output is shaped and processed by suitable circuitry, then used to trigger a switching device such as a thyristor, which switches a large current through the coil.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, {{psychiatrist}} David Spiegel {{said that}} the inclusion of Landis' 1956 study was unjustified. He argued that, while weighting larger studies more than smaller makes sense, combining {{the results of a}} large study examining very mild trauma (such as fending off an attacker) with studies of long-term physical and sexual abuse was inappropriate and led to erroneous conclusions. Rind et al. replied that Spiegel misrepresented their analysis, since they did not use Landis' study in the meta-analysis of childhood sexual abuse – symptom correlations, but only for examining the self-reported effects of CSA. They contend that the way <b>they</b> <b>handled</b> Landis' data maximized negative reports and minimized the possible deflating effect of Landis' data on the overall effect sizes.|$|E
25|$|Gingrich's {{service as}} Forrestal's aide {{made him an}} enemy of Admiral Ernest J. King, Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations, who resented Gingrich's outsized policy role and {{perceived}} Gingrich as being more loyal to Forrestal, a civilian political appointee, than to King, his uniformed superior. Gingrich crossed King more blatantly when Forrestal succeeded Frank Knox as Secretary of the Navy. King and his senior admirals had effectively excluded Knox from major war decisions by only showing him routine communications from the fleet and neglecting to present the important messages, which <b>they</b> <b>handled</b> themselves. Alerted to this practice, Gingrich advised Forrestal {{to go to the}} Navy Department communication room and examine all incoming telegrams for himself. Armed with this information, Forrestal was able to exert more influence over Navy Department operations than his predecessor, at King's expense.|$|E
500|$|In 1943, Raymond Hayes, a young {{adherent}} of Hensley's teachings, {{arrived in}} the Ooltewah area and began successfully preaching about snake handling. Hensley and Hayes started a church together in 1945, which they named the [...] "Dolly Pond Church of God with Signs Following". Later in 1945, {{a member of the}} church was bitten by a snake and died. The members of the church continued to handle snakes at services, including at the funeral of the man who died from snakebite. The man's death was viewed as ordained by God to test the faith of the congregants, and to demonstrate to non-believers that the snakes <b>they</b> <b>handled</b> were, in fact, dangerous. That year, Hensley was arrested for snake handling in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was given a $50 fine, which he refused to pay even when threatened with a workhouse sentence. He was released after members of his church appealed to authorities.|$|E

500|$|While strengthening, Favio brought {{heavy rains}} to {{southern}} Madagascar. After making landfall, Intense Tropical Cyclone Favio brought widespread damage to Vilanculos in Mozambique, where the cyclone killed four people and injured at least 70 in the town. About 80% {{of the town}} was destroyed. Overall, a total of ten people {{were killed by the}} storm and nearly 100others were injured, and combined with an earlier flood, the storm caused $71million (2007US$]]) in damage. Around 130,000homes suffered damage and 130schools were leveled by the tropical cyclone. Across the nation, a total of 33,000 people were left homeless during the system. Cyclone Favio destroyed [...] of crops. In Zimbabwe, 400 electricity poles were downed. During the aftermath of the storm, a number of agencies provided assistance to victims of Cyclone Favio in Mozambique. One agency donated $626,500, helping transport 50,000mosquito nets to the devastated area. A total of 5,500bars of soap, 1,600buckets, 50baths, and over 180latrines were distributed to the victims of the devastated area.

Hundreds of local red cross staff and volunteers were utilized; they worked around the clock to assist survivors. Thirty-one recovery centers opened, hosting 400first aid volunteers. According to a South African website, the government was praised for how well and quickly <b>they</b> <b>handled</b> the crisis. Key food items (rice, beans, corn meal, cooking oil, soap, and sugar) were distributed to the affected areas. On March5, a plan was launched to provide victims {{for a total of}} $71million worth of aid, of which $773,000 was expected to be directed towards the health.

500|$|Several European-American merchants {{influenced}} Navajo weaving {{during the}} next decades. The first to advertise Navajo textiles in a catalog was C. N. Cotton in 1894. Cotton encouraged professional production and marketing among his peers and the weavers whose work <b>they</b> <b>handled.</b> Another trader named John. B. Moore, who settled in the Chuska Mountains in 1897 attempted {{to improve the quality}} of textiles he traded. He attempted to regulate the cleaning and dyeing process of artisans who did business with him, and shipped wool intended for higher grade weaving outside the region for factory cleaning. He limited the range of dyes in textiles he traded and refused to deal fabric that had included certain commercially produced yarns. [...] Moore's catalogs identified individual textile pieces rather than illustrating representative styles. He appears to have been instrumental in introducing new motifs to Navajo weaving. Carpets from the Caucasus region were popular among Anglo-Americans at that time. Both the Navajo and the Caucasus weavers worked under similar conditions and in similar styles, so it was relatively simple for them to incorporate Caucasus patterns such as an octagonal motif known as a gul.|$|E
