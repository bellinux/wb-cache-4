25|$|During spring 2012, Jobbik {{representative}} in Hungarian parliament Zsolt Baráth caused an outrage by commemorating 1882 blood libel against the Jews in Parliament. The Tiszaeszlár blood libel, found later to be unrelated to Jews, {{was known as}} first major anti-Jewish event in modern Hungary, predating the Holocaust. The speech of Baráth caused controversy among Jobbik MPs: some - however finding it inappropriate and uncalled for - stated that in a matured democracy {{there should not be}} taboo topics, while leaders of the Jobbik Parliamentary Group told the media that they had evaluated the speech and learnt <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> they should care more about what their MPs are talking.

25|$|To be sure, Estimé had hastened his own demise {{in several}} ways. His {{nationalization}} of the Standard Fruit banana concession sharply reduced the firm's revenues. He alienated workers by {{requiring them to}} invest between 10 percent and 15 percent of their salaries in national-defense bonds. The president sealed his fate by attempting to manipulate the constitution in order to extend his term in office. Seizing on this action and the popular unrest it engendered, the army forced the president to resign on 10 May 1950. The same junta that had assumed power {{after the fall of}} Lescot reinstalled itself. An army escort conducted Estimé from the National Palace and into exile in Jamaica. The events of May 1946 made an impression upon the deposed minister of labor, François Duvalier. <b>The</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> Duvalier drew from Estimé's ouster was that the military could not be trusted. It was a lesson that he would act upon when he gained power.|$|E

It ought to, at any rate, because that story is plainly wrought out and is apparent as it is possible to make it." [...] A review in The Nickelodeon offered little more than a summary of the film, but the reviewer found the subject to be enhanced by the attention to detail in the production. The reviewer was also pleased that the child was not brought in to serve as in deus ex machina role. Though Lonergan was fond of using the technique. Even The New York Dramatic Mirror gave some praise to the production, but noted that the acting of the mother's friend was the weakest because [...] " [...] man of his [...] wouldn't have backed off so quickly." [...] Overall, the reviewer found the acting to be better than the narrative itself and concluded that [...] "omething less laboredly sentimental would be much stronger." ...|$|E

In London Kutuzov first learned of the American Revolutionary War. He would later study the evolution of American general George Washington's attrition campaign against the British.

2500|$|Production {{locomotives}} followed {{from the}} end of 1944, but these were rather different, <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> backwards-facing cylinders next to the firebox were a bad idea having been relearned. The production Q2 locomotives were of 4-4-6-4 arrangement; they were the largest non-articulated locomotives ever built and the most powerful locomotives ever static tested, producing [...] on the PRR's static test plant. The Q2 locomotives were also the most powerful steam locomotive ever constructed with ten driving wheels. In operation, the Q2 could outperform pre-existing freight engines hauling the double the tonnage of their predecessors. Furthermore, the Q2 had no problems building up steam power and was known to be a very smooth riding engine. 26 of them were built at PRR's Altoona Works and they were by far the most successful duplex type. The duplex propensity to slip was combated by an automatic slip control mechanism that reduced power to the slipping unit. The slip control mechanism wasn't always responsive and its complexity often lead to maintenance crews not wanting to bother with it during overhauls.|$|E

Ultimately it was about, you know, regardless of what happens in this relationship, I don't have to give up on loving this person, or loving myself, or give up on whatever my dreams are. Even though it's written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships. For me, the true meaning exists in the bridge saying 'I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily, I'm here to stay and make a difference.' That is for all of us. We all have something that we're fighting for or that we're striving for.

2500|$|On 15 October, {{later than}} {{proposed}} {{after two weeks}} of friction between British and French generals, Haig's I Corps was moved to Ypres in Flanders as part of the [...] "Race to the Sea". In the belief that the German northern flank was weak, Haig was ordered to march on Ghent, Bruges and Courtrai in western Belgium but the new German Chief of Staff Falkenhayn was trying to do the opposite and roll up the Allied northern flank. I Corps marched headlong into a thrust westward by fresh German forces and the result was the First Battle of Ypres. German forces, equipped with 250 heavy guns (a large number for this early stage in the war), outnumbered I Corps by two to one and came close to success. At one point Haig mounted his white horse to encourage his men, who were retreating around Gheluvelt, although in the event the town had just been recaptured by a battalion of the Worcesters before Haig's ride. Haig cemented his reputation at this battle and Ypres remained a symbolic piece of ground in later years. Haig was also influenced {{by the fact that the}} Germans had called off their offensive when they were on the verge of success, and he drew <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> attacks needed to be kept up so long as there was any chance of success.|$|E
2500|$|Popivanov {{characterizes the}} protests as exhibiting a strong anti-leftist slant, which {{in his view}} enabled the Bulgarian Socialist Party to {{consolidate}} its ranks and rally its supporters. The chairman of the Institute for Modern Politics, Borislav Tsekov, concurs with this assessment, deploring the [...] "primitive anti-communism" [...] espoused by the protesters due to being almost reminiscent {{of the spirit of}} McCarthyism. Left wing journalist Velislava Dareva, in addition to frowning upon the viscerally anti-communist rhetoric engaged in by the protesters, also believes that the protest lacked focus due to containing at least 10 different protester groups (demonstrating for hugely different reasons) within its ranks. However, the student occupiers have been described as somewhat less eager to jump on the anti-communist bandwagon. Left wing sociologist Andrey Raychev makes a distinction between [...] "citizen" [...] and [...] "political" [...] protests (with only the anti-Peevski phase of the demonstrations fitting the former definition) and maintains that parties were gradually learning <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> they could not simply [...] "insert themselves" [...] into a demonstration of the citizens, but need to carve out a separate niche. Due to the perceived anti-leftist leanings of the protesters, quite a few left-wing commentators (somewhat paradoxically given that globally protests tend to resonate with those who are {{on the left side of}} the political spectrum) took a stand against the demonstrations.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{begins with}} the narrator asking how Nazis are born and developed. [...] The story takes the {{audience}} to the child’s academic beginning in kindergarten. [...] Child stories are often adapted to meet the state's needs so, characters and plot lines are often changed. [...] In the story, the wicked witch is known as democracy, while sleeping beauty is Germany and the knight that saves her is played by Hitler. [...] The cartoon depicts this story in a rather short fashion but also depicts the two main characters (Hitler and Germany) ridiculously. [...] On a more serious note, the cartoon next shows the child and his schoolmates in a class giving the infamous Heil Hitler salute repeatedly. [...] However, the young boy becomes sick and the narrator informs the audience that unless the child becomes better again he will be taken away, being denounced unfit and will never be heard from again. [...] However, he does recover and returns to school where he gives his daily pledge to fight, obey, and die for his Fuehrer. [...] The boy answers a question incorrectly and is publicly humiliated. [...] <b>The</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>that</b> the young boy learns later is that weakness {{is not to be}} tolerated and that the world belongs to the strong and brutal. [...] The next few scenes show a book burning demonstration and other famous works being burned that are declared illegal by the state. [...] Icons such as the Holy Bible are replaced with Mein Kampf and an image of the crucifix is replaced with a sword that has the Nazi swastika on it. [...] Fast-forwarding a few years, the boy is older and is marching first as a teenage Hitler youth and then eventually as a soldier. [...] The narrator ends the cartoon with the words, “His education is complete, his education for death” as a vast German army fades into a cemetery with crosses over thousands of graves.|$|E
