5|$|Governor David Paterson's {{selection}} process {{began with a}} number of prominent names and high-ranking New York Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, Fran Drescher and Caroline Kennedy, vying for the spot. Gillibrand quietly campaigned for the position, meeting secretly with Paterson on at least one occasion. She said that she made an effort <b>to</b> <b>underscore</b> her successful House elections in a largely conservative district, adding that she could be a good complement to Chuck Schumer. Gillibrand was presumed a likely choice {{in the days before the}} official announcement. On January 23, 2009, Paterson held a press conference to announce Gillibrand as his choice.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>underscore</b> {{that the}} feast {{represents}} an exotic bygone world of pre-partition Poland, Mickiewicz {{added to this}} a list of random dishes, ingredients and additives, whose names he found in Compendium ferculorum and which had already been forgotten in his own time: kontuza (soup of boiled and sieved meat), arkas (sweet milk-based jelly), blemas (blancmange), pomuchla (Atlantic cod), figatele (meatballs), cybeta (civet), piżmo (musk), dragant (tragacanth), pinele (pine nuts) and brunele (prunes). This {{is followed by a}} similar enumeration of various kinds of fish, whose names are likewise taken from the inventory at the beginning of Czerniecki's book. A description of a white-apron-clad chef and a reference to Prince Ossoliński's banquet in Rome, both found in Book 11, are also clearly inspired by Czerniecki's characterization of a master chef and his dedication, respectively.|$|E

40|$|The newly {{introduced}} Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), which {{relies on}} a single largest dimension of tumor {{rather than on the}} product of perpendicular diameters World Health Organisation (WHO) is intended to simplify the assessment of tumor response. PURPOSE: Is to evaluate the performance and validity of the RECIST compared to the WHO criteria. DESIGN: Thirty-four consecutive patients with bidimensionally measurable malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) were evaluated prospectively. RESULTS: In 27 % (9 / 34) a discrepancy was found between the WHO and RECIST response evaluation 9 % (3 / 34) concerned best responses and 18 % (6 / 34) objective confirmed responses. In 24 % (8 / 34) disease progression was missed by RECIST. The percentage of patients in whom one or more discordance's between WHO and RECIST were detected was 47, 88 % due <b>to</b> <b>underscoring</b> by RECIST. In a subgroup of 24 MPM patients with bidimensionally measurable pleural lesions only, the discrepancy rate was 29 %, always due <b>to</b> <b>underscoring</b> by RECIST. However, when in the same subgroup the modified RECIST response evaluation was used the discrepancy rate was 21 % and in all cases due <b>to</b> <b>underscoring</b> by WHO. CONCLUSION: For MPM bidimensional WHO response evaluation cannot automatically be replaced by RECIST because MPM has a non-spherical growth pattern. Our recommendation is to use the WHO criteria for bidimensional measurable lesions, RECIST for unidimensional measurable lesions and a modified RECIST response evaluation, in which the short axis perpendicular to the chest wall is used, for thickened pleural rind disease, according to the method used in the recently completed pemetrexed (Alimta) trial for MPM...|$|R

Raimundo Teixeira Mendes presented a project in which the imperial coat of arms was replaced by a blue celestial globe and the positivist motto. It was presented to Fonseca, who promptly accepted. The flag was designed by a group formed by Raimundo Teixeira Mendes, Miguel Lemos, Manuel Pereira Reis and Décio Villares. It was officially adopted on 19 November 1889.|$|E
25|$|Wilder wrote Our Town, {{a popular}} play (and later film) set in fictional Grover's Corners, New Hampshire. It was {{inspired}} by his friend Gertrude Stein's novel The Making of Americans, and many elements of Stein's modernist style {{can be found in}} the play. Wilder suffered from writer's block while writing the final act. Our Town employs a choric narrator called the Stage Manager and a minimalist set <b>to</b> <b>underscore</b> the human experience. Wilder played the Stage Manager on Broadway for two weeks and later in summer stock productions. Following the daily lives of the Gibbs and Webb families, as well as the other inhabitants of Grover's Corners, the play illustrates the importance of the universality of the simple, yet meaningful lives of all people in the world in order to demonstrate the value of appreciating life. The play won the 1938 Pulitzer Prize.|$|E

25|$|Morse was reelected in 1950. Earlier in that year, {{he was one}} of the six Senators who {{supported}} Margaret Chase Smith's Declaration of Conscience, which criticized the tactics of McCarthyism. In protest of Dwight Eisenhower's selection of Richard Nixon as his running mate, Morse left the Republican Party in 1952. The 1952 election produced an almost evenly divided Senate; Morse brought a folding chair when the session convened, intending to position himself in the aisle between the Democrats and Republicans <b>to</b> <b>underscore</b> his lack of party affiliation. Morse expected to retain certain committee memberships but was denied membership on the Labor Committee and others. He used a parliamentary procedure to force a vote of the entire Senate, but lost his bid. Senator Herbert Lehman offered Morse his seat on the Labor Committee, which Morse ultimately accepted.|$|E

On every visit to the bathroom, he was accompanied by at least two men. Every day, Ross argued with Scott about matters of religion, without giving him a chance to say anything in return, often tapping him or hitting him on the head <b>to</b> <b>underscore</b> his points while Scott was being restrained or closely watched. Scott was told that he would only regain his liberty once the deprogramming had been concluded successfully and he had given up his beliefs.|$|E
25|$|The {{domestic}} underground resistance movement, the Armia Krajowa (Home Army), {{fought against}} German occupation. The wartime resistance movement in Poland {{was one of}} the three largest resistance movements of the entire war, and encompassed an unusually broad range of clandestine activities, which functioned as an underground state complete with degree-awarding universities and a court system. The resistance was loyal to the exiled government and generally resented the idea of a communist Poland; for this reason, in the summer of 1944 they initiated Operation Tempest, of which the Warsaw Uprising that begun on 1 August 1944 was the best known operation. The objective of the uprising was to drive the German occupiers from the city and help with the larger fight against Germany and the Axis powers. Secondary motives were to see Warsaw liberated before the Soviets could reach the capital, so as <b>to</b> <b>underscore</b> Polish sovereignty by empowering the Polish Underground State before the Soviet-backed Polish Committee of National Liberation could assume control. A lack of Allied support and Stalin's reluctance to allow the 1st Army to help their fellow countrymen take the city led to the uprising's failure and subsequent planned destruction of the city.|$|E
40|$|This work {{surveys the}} {{modalities}} for pension trust investment in Nigeria, which {{has only recently}} been favoured with a distinct legal framework. It gives a brief historical account of pension administration in Nigeria, identifies the policy and philosophical underpinnings of the new pension regime, expounds the relevant provisions of the Pension Reform Act 2014 together with the Regulation on Investment of Pension Fund Assets, and concludes with {{a critique of the}} Act and recommendations. Pertinent comparison is made between the provisions of the new legislation and extant Trustee Investments Act (which hitherto governed pension trust investments) with a view <b>to</b> <b>underscoring</b> the sea change wrought by the new Act. Despite drafting flaws and other inadequacies, by creating a separate regime for pension trust investment; introducing defined contribution scheme and pension trusts into the public service; enlarging the scope of pension trust investments and initiating guaranteed minimum pension and Pension Protection Fund, the recent enactment represents a milestone in the annals of Nigerian pension legislation...|$|R
