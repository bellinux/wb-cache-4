On the day of his retirement he ends up in an unexpected situation, and is forced to reconsider his life. As in other films by Hamer, the themes are loneliness and old age, and the courage to <b>take</b> <b>chances.</b> O' Horten {{has been described as a}} film without a strong plot or a clear chronology.|$|E

This is memorable television. Hands down." [...] E!

[...] Kevin O'Donnell of Spin wrote that West delivered one of the show's [...] "most unique performances of all-time." [...] West performed the song in an entirely red outfit.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, New Line Cinema {{bought the}} rights to produce an English-language remake with Guillermo del Toro as producer. On remakes, {{director}} Bayona noted that [...] "The Americans have {{all the money in}} the world but can't do anything, while we can do whatever we want but don't have the money" [...] and [...] "The American industry doesn't <b>take</b> <b>chances,</b> that's why they make remakes of movies that were already big hits". On August 4, 2009, Larry Fessenden was announced as the director of the American remake. Fessenden was later announced that he will not be involved with directing the remake, stating [...] "Working on the script with Guillermo was a very exciting experience, but then I got into a casting miasma and that's where the thing is; I think they're gonna do it another way, actually. So I think I'm out of it. Hopefully they'll still use my script, but I'm not sure I'm directing it anymore". In January 2010, Mark Pellington replaced Larry Fessenden as director of the project.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons was {{the first}} {{successful}} animated program in American prime time since Wait Till Your Father Gets Home in the 1970s. During most of the 1980s, US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. The Simpsons changed this perception, initially leading to a short period where networks attempted to recreate prime-time cartoon success with shows like Capitol Critters, Fish Police, and Family Dog, which were expensive and unsuccessful. The Simpsons use of Korean animation studios for tweening, coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of The Simpsons and the lower production cost prompted US television networks to <b>take</b> <b>chances</b> on other animated series. This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows, such as South Park, Family Guy, King of the Hill, Futurama and The Critic. For Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, [...] "The Simpsons created an audience for prime-time animation {{that had not been}} there for many, many years... As far as I'm concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They created what is in many ways—you could classify it as—a wholly new medium." ...|$|E
500|$|Spence D. of IGN Music {{commented that}} the best {{examples}} of Knowles vocal stylings come on [...] "Ring The Alarm", adding that {{it is one of the}} few tracks on the album where she goes for a throaty growl. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that it was a bold choice for a single Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic noted that [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] was a brave choice for a single, called it [...] "angry and lyrically incendiary", and noted that Swizz Beatz's beats are [...] "unusually intricate". Norman Meyers of Prefix Magazine noted that the song is evidence of Knowles' willingness to <b>take</b> <b>chances.</b> Calling [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] a [...] "bunny-boiling bonanza" [...] and a [...] "killer club track", Rach Read of TeenToday wrote that it is a definite highlight and that [...] "it's great to see an artist at the top of her game prepared to take risks with a track as unhinged as this." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post defined Knowles' character in the song as a [...] "jealousy-crazed ex", and expressed his disappointment that it could not manage a [...] "more convincing refrain". Andy Kellman of Allmusic called it [...] "an angered, atonal, and out-of-character song". Tim Finney of Pitchfork Media wrote, [...] "the siren-assisted caterwaul of second single 'Ring the Alarm' sounds genuinely (and marvelously) incoherent." [...] Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald described [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] as a [...] "posturing and eventually annoying" [...] track.|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can <b>take</b> <b>chances.</b> You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E
500|$|As major Hollywood {{studios and}} audiences both become savvy to cult films, {{productions}} once limited to cult appeal have instead become popular hits, and cult directors have become hot properties known for more mainstream and accessible films. [...] Remarking {{on the popular}} trend of remaking cult films, Claude Brodesser-Akner of New York magazine states that Hollywood studios have been superstitiously hoping to recreate past successes rather than trading on nostalgia. [...] Their popularity would bring some critics to proclaim the death of cult films {{now that they have}} finally become successful and mainstream, are too slick to attract a proper cult following, lack context, or are too easily found online. [...] In response, David Church says that cult film fans have retreated to more obscure and difficult to find films, often using illegal distribution methods, which preserves the outlaw status of cult films. [...] Virtual spaces, such as online forums and fan sites, replace the traditional fanzines and newsletters. [...] Cult film fans consider themselves collectors, rather than consumers, as they associate consumers with mainstream, Hollywood audiences. [...] This collecting can take the place of fetishization of a single film. [...] Addressing concerns that DVDs have revoked the cult status of films like Rocky Horror, academic Mikel J. Koven states that small scale screenings with friends and family can replace midnight showings. [...] Koven also identifies television shows, such as Twin Peaks, as retaining more traditional cult activities inside popular culture. David Lynch himself has not ruled out another television series, as studios have become reluctant to <b>take</b> <b>chances</b> on non-mainstream ideas. [...] Despite this, the Alamo Drafthouse has capitalized on cult films and the surrounding culture through inspiration drawn from Rocky Horror and retro promotional gimmickry. [...] They sell out their shows regularly and have acquired a cult following of their own.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake {{on the video}} for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and <b>take</b> <b>chances</b> and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E
