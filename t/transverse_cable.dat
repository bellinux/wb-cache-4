40|$|An {{accurate}} {{analysis of}} the natural frequencies and mode shapes of a cable-stayed bridge is fundamental to the solution of its dynamic responses due to seismic, wind and traffic loads. In most previous studies, the stay cables have been modelled as single truss elements in conventional finite element analysis. This method is simple but it is inadequate for the accurate dynamic analysis of a cable-stayed bridge because it essentially precludes the <b>transverse</b> <b>cable</b> vibrations. This paper presents a comprehensive study of various modelling schemes for the dynamic analysis of cable-stayed bridges. The modelling schemes studied include the finite {{element method and the}} dynamic stiffness method. Both the mesh options of modelling each stay cable as a single truss element with an equivalent modulus and modelling each stay cable by a number of cable elements with the original modulus are studied. Their capability to account for <b>transverse</b> <b>cable</b> vibrations in the overall dynamic analysis as well as their accuracy and efficiency are investigated. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

In general, {{the use of}} cables has many potential advantages such as high-speed manipulation, larger payloads, larger range of motion, access to remote locations and applications in hazardous environments. However, cable flexibility inevitably causes vibrations and poses a concern in high-bandwidth, high-precision applications. ^ Cable vibrations typically occur in both the longitudinal and mutually perpendicular transverse directions and are coupled. The coupling between longitudinal and transverse modes is usually assumed to be minimal since longitudinal resonances are usually at much higher frequencies compared to transverse frequencies. In a cable-pulley system, the coupling between the cable and high-inertia components such as pulleys {{can lead to a}} drastic reduction in the fundamental longitudinal mode. This coupling becomes more prominent under conditions of autoparametric or internal resonance in the system. When these conditions are met, <b>transverse</b> <b>cable</b> vibrations and pulley rotations exchange significant energy leading to higher amplitudes of oscillations not predicted by classical linear analyses. The design parameters needed to facilitate autoparametric resonance are further examined through a parametric analysis of the system. ^ The coupled cable-pulley dynamics are derived and the flexible modes of the overall system are calculated analytically and verified experimentally. In the system examined, the dominant resonance mode is caused by cable elasticity and cannot be ignored in high-bandwidth high-precision applications. This is in contrast to most robot manipulators where the resonant modes are assumed to be dominated either by joint or link flexibility. Experimental observations of the system 2 ̆ 7 s frequency response are used to model the cables as axial springs and a trajectory tracking problem is formulated using a lumped parameter model of the system with matched uncertainty in the drive motor dynamics as well as unmatched uncertainty in the load pulley dynamics. The controller is constructed using a Lyapunov-type direct adaptive robust control (DARC) framework with necessary design modifications to accommodate uncertain and non-smooth nonlinearities in the system. The proposed controller guarantees prescribed output-tracking transient performance as well as final tracking accuracy in the presence of both parametric uncertainties and other uncertain nonlinearities. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate its effectiveness. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{design of}} legged robots for {{movement}} has usually {{been based on}} a series of rigid links connected by actuated or passively compliant joints. However, the potential utility of tensegrity, in which form can be achieved using a disconnected set of rigid elements connected by a continuous network of tensile elements, has not been considered in the design of legged robots. This paper introduces the idea of a legged robot based on a tensegrity 1, and demonstrates that the dynamics of such structures can be utilized for locomotion. A mobile robot based on a triangular tensegrity prism is presented, which is actuated by contraction of its <b>transverse</b> <b>cables.</b> The automatic design of a controller architecture for forward locomotion is performed in simulation using a genetic algorithm which demonstrates that the structure can generate multiple effective gait patterns for forward locomotion.

In {{order to reduce the}} {{deformation}} of the pylons {{toward the center of the}} circle, two cables are established from the top to the bottom of the pylon. It is also effective for increasing the torsional rigidity. This bridge is designed to accommodate dual four-lane traffic; its design incorporates a curved stiffening girder and additional <b>transverse</b> <b>cables</b> to stabilize each tower. The striffening girder is designed as a PC box using reinforced concrete of grade 40MPa; It is 3.3m deep and almost 24m wide, and incorporates steel struts and FRP pipe struts filled with concrete in the internal and external box respectively, to resist the local tensile stress. These internal and external struts are placed at typical centers of 6m and 3m respectively and give the stiffening girder and increased torsional rigidity and make the decks 20% lighter than a traditional concrete box girder. In this bridge, a single plane multiple cable system with harp arrangement was chosen in order to reduce the longitudinal and transverse deformation of the towers. As the shear center deviates from the center of the stiffening girder due to the application of the asymmetric cable forces and self-weight, twisting and transverse deformation may occur.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} using the probabilistic neural network (PNN) to identify the damage type and region in the cable-stayed Ting Kau Bridge from the simulated noisy modal data. The essence of the PNN for damage type and region identification is to judge the pattern class of damage types and regions to which the test vectors of unknown source should belong.

The interpretations are based on current distribution analysis from self-field measurements with Hall sensor arrays and current sharing measurements. The possible variation in voltage–current (VI) curves among the sub-cables in the PFIS caused by the cable self-field and joint non-uniformity is a principal issue {{for the evaluation of}} the strand-to-cable performance. The <b>cable</b> <b>transverse</b> voltages, initiated by current non-uniformity in a cabled conductor, can affect the shape of the longitudinal VI curve. The basic cable data are obtained by petal-to-conduit contact resistance and conduit resistivity measurements under transverse cyclic load in the Twente Cryogenic Cable Press. We assessed the impact of the conduit, the sub-cable resistive barrier wraps and the location of the voltage taps on the measured voltage, and some comparisons were carried out with experimental runs on the PFIS. The outcome confirms that the transverse voltages, caused by current redistribution, do affect the shape of the VI transition. This effect seems particularly important in short sample tests. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the location of the voltage taps can affect the experimentally obtained VI curve and solutions for most accurate measurement of the VI are discussed in the paper. The numerical model, CUDI–CICC covers the final cabling stage of inter-petal interactions only, by which the possible role of intra-petal non-uniformities is ignored, although recognized as potentially relevant. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLow-temperature superconductors {{are widely}} used in high-field magnets, mostly within Rutherford-type cables. The run for higher fields leads to greater forces on the conductor, which is pushed closer to its {{mechanical}} limit. Managing the higher strain and stress levels on the conductor supposes to perform simulation at the strand level, especially with strain-sensitive superconductors such as Nb 3 Sn. Three-dimensional models are necessary because inside of a magnet, the conductor is subject to a complex combination of axial and <b>transverse</b> loads. Superconducting <b>cables</b> are anisotropic composite structures that can comprise superconducting strands, insulation materials, stabilizing parts, porosities, etc. They have a multiscale architecture, the performance at the magnet scale being driven by the filament scale.

The 3 -D mesh of two reference cables is built with a simplified cable forming model. The accuracy of this geometrical model is assessed by comparing sections of the simulated mesh with tomographic data, using relevant criteria and specific geometry analysis tools. In this approach, the strand is considered as bimetallic, with a copper core, a superconducting bundle ring, and an outer copper ring. After mechanical 3 -D FE computation on this bimetallic mesh, the strain/stress state on the local compounds of the strand (including Nb 3 Sn filaments) is obtained by strain projection.

40|$|The ITER cable-in-conduit {{conductors}} (CICCs) {{are built}} up from sub-cable bundles, wound in different stages, which are twisted to counter coupling loss caused by time-changing external magnet fields. The {{selection of the}} twist pitch lengths has major implications {{for the performance of}} the cable in the case of strain sensitive superconductors, i. e. Nb 3 Sn, as the electromagnetic and thermal contraction loads are large but also for the heat load from the AC coupling loss. Reduction of the transverse load and warm-up cool-down degradation can be reached by applying longer twist pitches in a particular sequence for the sub-stages, offering a large <b>cable</b> <b>transverse</b> stiffness, adequate axial flexibility and maximum allowed lateral strand support. Analysis of short sample (TF conductor) data reveals that increasing the twist pitch can lead to a gain of the effective axial compressive strain of more than 0. 3 % with practically no degradation from bending. For reduction of the coupling loss, specific choices of the cabling twist sequence are needed with the aim to minimize the area of linked strands and bundles that are coupled and form loops with the applied changing magnetic field, instead of simply avoiding longer pitches. In addition we recommend increasing the wrap coverage of the CS conductor from 50 % to at least 70 %. The models predict significant improvement against strain sensitivity and substantial decrease of the AC coupling loss in Nb 3 Sn CICCs, but also for NbTi CICCs minimization of the coupling loss can be achieved. Although the success of long pitches to transverse load degradation was already demonstrated, the prediction of the combination with low coupling loss needs to be validated by a short sample test.

40|$|AbstractCables {{are often}} prone to {{potentially}} damaging large amplitude vibrations. The dynamic excitation may be from external loading or {{motion of the}} cable ends, the latter including direct excitation, normally from components of end motion <b>transverse</b> to the <b>cable,</b> and parametric excitation induced by axial components of end motion causing dynamic tension variations. Geometric nonlinearity can be important, causing stiffening behaviour and nonlinear modal coupling. Previous analyses of the vibrations, often neglecting sag, have generally dealt with direct and parametric excitation separately or have reverted to numerical solutions of the responses. Here a nonlinear cable model is adopted, applicable to taut cables such as on cable-stayed bridges, that allows for cable inclination, small sag (such that the vibration modes {{are similar to those}} of a taut string), multiple modes in both planes and end motion and/or external forcing close to any natural frequency. Based on the method of scaling and averaging it is found that, for sinusoidal inputs and positive damping, non-zero steady state responses can only occur in the modes in each plane with natural frequencies close to the excitation frequency and those with natural frequencies close to half this frequency. Analytical solutions, in the form of non-dimensional polynomial equations, are derived for the steady state vibration amplitudes in up to three modes simultaneously: the directly excited mode, the corresponding nonlinearly coupled mode in the orthogonal plane and a parametrically excited mode with half the natural frequency. The stability of the solutions is also identified. The outputs of the equations are consistent with previous results, where available. Example results from the analytical solutions are presented for a typical inclined bridge cable subject to vertical excitation of the lower end, and they are validated by numerical integration of the equations of motion and against some previous experimental results. It is shown that the modal interactions and sag (although very small) affect the responses significantly...|$|R
40|$|A {{distributed}} {{fiber optic}} sensor {{with the ability}} of detecting and locating intruders on foot and vehicles over long perimeters (> 10 km) was studied. The response of the sensor to people walking over or near it and to vehicles driving nearby was observed and analyzed. The sensor works {{on the principle of}} phase sensitive optical time domain re ectometry, making use of interferometric effects of Rayleigh backscattered light along a single mode fiber. Light pulses from a highly stable Er:doped fiber laser emitting single longitudinal mode light and exhibiting low frequency drift are passed through one end of the buried fiber. The backscattered light emerging from the same fiber end was monitored using a photodetector. The phase changes produced in the light pulse due to the pressure of the intruder walking directly above or near the sensor or from the seismic disturbances created by vehicles moving {{in the vicinity of the}} sensor are detected using the phase sensitive Optical Time Domain Re ectometer (OTDR). Field tests were conducted with the sensing element as a single mode fiber in a 3 -mm diameter cable buried at depths ranging from 8 to 18 inches in clay soil. It was observed that the sensor could detect intruders walking <b>transverse</b> to the <b>cable</b> line at a distance of 40 ft from it. A car moving at a speed of 30 mph on a rough road could be consistently detected up to a distance of 480 ft from the sensor, while a car driven on a smooth road 200 ft from the sensor could be detected only when passing through rough patches on the road. Tests were also performed with an intruder walking near the sensor while a car was driven at a speed of 30 mph on a rough road. The effect on the signal due to the intruder on foot could be distinguished clearly only when the car was at least 200 ft away from the sensor. The results in this thesis represent the first quantitative study of the sensitivity of the sensor under varied test conditions.
