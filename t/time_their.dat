5|$|An {{important}} aspect {{of all of these}} examples of noise in European keyboard and string music before the 19th century is that they are used as sound effects in programme music. Sounds that would likely cause offense in other musical contexts are made acceptable by their illustrative function. Over <b>time,</b> <b>their</b> evocative effect was weakened as {{at the same time they}} became incorporated more generally into abstract musical contexts.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of his stay at Pondicherry, there were few followers, but with <b>time</b> <b>their</b> numbers grew, resulting {{in the formation of the}} Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1926. From 1926 he started to sign himself as Sri Aurobindo, Sri (meaning holy in Sanskrit) being commonly used as an honorific.|$|E
5|$|Crews still form {{based on}} friendships and neighborhoods. For example, dance crew Diversity—formed in 2007—consists of {{brothers}} and friends from Essex and London.

In 2013, Hip Op-eration performed an exhibition routine at the World Hip Hop Dance Championships in Las Vegas. At the <b>time,</b> <b>their</b> youngest member was 66.|$|E

5|$|For the Muslims, {{the battle}} was a {{significant}} setback.

5|$|Having {{made only}} 5 and 18 in the {{previous}} Test, Jack Crapp was originally dropped from the team but was reprieved by Washbrook's injury. The England selectors were widely condemned for their decisions, which were seen as an investment in youth rather than necessarily picking the best players available at the <b>time.</b> <b>Their</b> frequent changes meant the home team had used a total of 21 players for the five Tests.|$|E

5|$|Labradors are {{powerful}} and indefatigable swimmers noted {{for their ability}} to tolerate the coldest of water for extended periods of <b>time.</b> <b>Their</b> ability to work quietly alongside hunters while watching for birds to fall from the sky, marking where they land, and then using their outstanding nose to find and retrieve dead or wounded birds has made them the king of waterfowl retrievers.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{spend much}} of their time resting and are {{inactive}} for about 20hours per day. Although lions can be active at any <b>time,</b> <b>their</b> activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50minutes eating.|$|E
5|$|Moulting is {{very slow}} and complex. Black {{cockatoos}} appear to replace their flight feathers {{one at a}} <b>time,</b> <b>their</b> moult taking two years to complete. This process is much shorter in other species, such as the galah and long-billed corella, which each take around six months to replace all their flight feathers.|$|E

5|$|The ships {{used the}} basic {{design of the}} Cerberus-class breastwork {{monitors}} to reduce design and construction <b>time.</b> <b>Their</b> hulls were completed very quickly, but the pace of building reduced as the likelihood of their immediate use diminished.

5|$|The two men {{credited}} {{with the birth of}} forecasting as a science were officer of the Royal Navy Francis Beaufort and his protégé Robert FitzRoy.

50|$|In London in 1995, {{the median}} income was £19,000 and the median house price was £83,000, meaning that people were {{spending}} 4.4 <b>times</b> <b>their</b> income on buying a property.

5|$|Argasid ticks, unlike ixodid ticks, may {{go through}} {{up to seven}} nymphal stages (instars), {{requiring}} a meal of blood each <b>time.</b> <b>Their</b> life cycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs {{over the course of}} her lifetime. Larvae feed very quickly and detach to molt into nymphs. Both male and female adults feed on blood, and they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process which is unique to argasid ticks.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal were {{appearing}} in {{the final of the}} FA Cup for the 14th <b>time,</b> <b>their</b> first in over three years. They had won the cup seven times previously (in 1930, 1936, 1950, 1971, 1979, 1993 and 1998) and were beaten in the final six times. By comparison, Liverpool were making their 12th appearance in a FA Cup final. The club won the cup five times (in 1964, 1974, 1986, 1989, 1992) and lost six finals, most recent of which against Manchester United in 1996. Arsenal and Liverpool had previously met thirteen times in the FA Cup, including four replays. Arsenal had a slender advantage in those meetings, winning five times to Liverpool's four. Both clubs were involved in the longest ever semi-final in FA Cup history in 1980, which required three replays after the original tie ended goalless. Brian Talbot's goal at Highfield Road earnt Arsenal a 1–0 victory.|$|E
5|$|Between them, the Harvey {{brothers}} totalled 25,185 runs in 772 appearances for the Fitzroy Cricket Club. Over <b>time,</b> <b>their</b> {{numbers in}} the ranks began to diminish. In 194950, Mick moved to Queensland while Harold was dropped from his position in the Fitzroy First XI. Merv retired after 1954-55 and Neil moved to New South Wales after 195657. Ray retired from the First XI {{at the end of}} 196061 and Brian the year after. In 1962-63, the club played their first season for 30 years without a Harvey in the team. At first-class level, the family's contribution is 26,532 in 405 appearances, with 7,964 coming for Victoria.|$|E

5|$|During {{the week}} of 22 May, United had a bye week from league play, which allowed the club to {{schedule}} a home friendly against the defending Dutch champions, AFC Ajax of Amsterdam. The previous week, Ajax had tallied a 3–1 win over Twente to secure the Dutch title for an unprecedented 30th <b>time,</b> <b>their</b> first since 2004. The Amsterdamers notched an early strike in the 10th minute thanks to forward, and Serbian international, Miralem Sulejmani. The Black-and-Red managed {{to make up for}} the early setback thanks to a 58th-minute cross from Ngwenya to newly drafted Blake Brettschneider, leveling the match at one apiece. However, the match ended in Ajax's favor over United as the Amsterdammers tallied a final goal in the 87th minute courtesy of midfielder Vurnon Anita.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} of his frigates in the Java Sea, Pellew mustered a {{significant}} force in the early autumn of 1806, including four ships of the line, two frigates and a brig with which to eliminate the remaining Dutch squadron. Reaching the Sunda Strait on 23 November, Pellew passed by the port of Bantam and on 27 November reached Batavia, splitting his forces so that the lighter vessels sailed close to shore and the ships of the line remained in deeper water outside the channel entering the harbour. A corvette was captured, {{and the rest of the}} Dutch squadron was taken by surprise, mistaking Pellew's force for a French squadron. By the <b>time</b> <b>their</b> mistake was revealed, the harbour was already blocked and so Captain Vander Sande drove Phoenix ashore, followed by six other warships and 22 merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|For a {{brief period}} {{following}} {{the decline of the}} Vijayanagara Empire, the devotional movement seemed to lose momentum, only to become active again in the 17th century, producing an estimated 300 poets in this genre; famous among them are Vijaya Dasa (1682–1755), Gopala Dasa (1721–1769), Jagannatha Dasa (1728–1809), Mahipathi Dasa (1750), Helavanakatte Giriamma and others. Over <b>time,</b> <b>their</b> devotional songs inspired a form of religious and didactic performing art of the Vaishnava people called the Harikatha ("Stories of Hari"). Similar developments were seen among the followers of the Veerashaiva faith, who popularised the Shivakatha ("Stories of Shiva").|$|E
