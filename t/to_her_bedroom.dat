25|$|Local traditions {{states that}} when the village was still called Benquerença, there was a {{beautiful}} orphan princess who lived in her uncle, {{the lord of the}} castle. The princess {{fell in love with a}} noble young knight who did not possess great wealth. For this reason, the young man left the village in search of fortune, promising to return when he felt he had a worthy fortune to ask for her hand. For years, the princess refused all suitors, until her uncle promised her to a friend, forcing her to compromise. When she was presented to the uncle of her suitor, she confessed that her heart belonged to another man. This revelation infuriated her uncle, who thought of a ruse to coerce her to marry the one he chose. At night, he disguised as a ghost, and went through the ports of the Princess quarters, pretending to be the ghost of her lover, telling her to marr her suitor or otherwise be subject to damnation. As he was about to get an oath from her, the door <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> opened with a bright ray of light, exposing her uncle's treachery.

The video begins with Lo lying in bed next to her boyfriend. When she starts to sing, she has an out-of-body experience. In the next scene, Lo appears in a room where she cuts her head open and releases her [...] "demons and dark thoughts". In an interview with Artistdirect, she explained that the demons represent [...] "those thoughts about this other person [...] will always haunt you a bit" [...] and [...] "always stick with you". Then, she is walking on the city streets when the demons start to follow her. She runs barefoot through the woods, where she stops and sings around the entities.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Over" [...] {{was directed by}} Jake Nava in Los Angeles, California, who also directed the video for her previous single [...] "Rumors" [...] (2004).

In the video, Lohan is walking home, when she sees her love interest (played by Drew Fuller) looking out of a window in his house as his mother sets the table behind him.

The curtains close and Lohan continues on to her house, next door to her boyfriend’s, and runs up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom.</b> Looking out her window, she sees that he is looking back at her. As noted inside Lohan’s bedroom, she is starting to experiment with rebellious adolescence. There are Teletubbies and stuffed pandas, but also posters of bands such as L7, the Dead Kennedys and CBGB. These imagery are intercut with shots of Lohan and her band playing in a garage, a pool party, and also her love interest destroying his father’s car in the family garage.|$|E
500|$|As well {{as using}} {{existing}} music, {{such as the}} themes for the Daleks, Cybermen, and Rose, Murray Gold specially composed {{a piece of music}} for Rose's farewell entitled [...] "Doomsday", which featured vocal work from Melanie Pappenheim. Instead of using the swelling violins that Davies {{and the rest of the}} production team had expected, Gold took a minimalist approach. When pitching the track to the production team, Gold described the track as representing Rose's unbridled energy and determination as she searches for the Doctor. He later said, [...] "I wanted to get that kind of throbbing, sort of hurt sound of quite emotional rock, because I thought that's what Rose would do if she was hurting and ran up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> and locked herself in her room and had a good old cry, really." [...] The piece uses the same vocal work from [...] "Rose", when Rose first enters the TARDIS, thus creating a bookend effect. It is a favourite among fans and of executive producer Julie Gardner, and is one of the reasons, along with Pappenheim's overall contribution and the [...] "Song for Ten" [...] from [...] "The Christmas Invasion", that the [...] was released several months later.|$|E

500|$|According to Inside the Hits, {{the lyrics}} {{refer to the}} commotion created by Billie Jean on a dance floor. She entices the crowd with a seductive come-on before luring Jackson <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom,</b> through the {{fragrance}} of her perfume. Jackson's vocal range spanned from a high baritone to a falsetto and he usually wrote melodies to show this range. However, in the verses of [...] "Billie Jean", the singer's vocals range from a tenor to a low falsetto. A four note falsetto is showcased in the chorus and, during the last line, Jackson peaks at a full octave. The song has a tempo of 117 beats per minute {{and is in the}} key of F minor. Following the first chorus, a cello-like synth eases in at the beginnings of both the third, and later, the fourth, verses. Upon the announcement that the baby's eyes resemble Jackson's, a voice laments, [...] "oh no". This is met with Jackson's signature falsetto [...] "hee hee". The bridge debuts the strings, and holds a pedal tone tonic with the exception of two lines and a chord leading into the chorus. Violins are then played, followed by a four-note minor guitar solo. During the solo, vocal shouts, screams and laughs are added. Throughout this, the chord progression remains unaltered and is laced with Jackson's vocal hiccups. All the musical and vocal elements are then brought together in the final chorus. In the fade, Jackson repeats the denial of fathering Billie Jean's child.|$|E

Upon insisting that they treat her more like a guest than a prisoner, Lumiere decides to go against the Beast's orders and invites Belle to dinner. A [...] "food chorus line," [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] is [...] "a rollicking invitation to Belle from the castle staff."

[...] Commonly regarded as the [...] "show-stopper"|website = Disney.com|publisher = Disney|accessdate = April 20, 2014}} of Beauty and the Beast, the sequence both visually and musically [...] "derive insatiable energy and excitement from the gradual accumulation of participation." [...] The Washington Post observed that [...] "'Be Our Guest'" [...] involves [...] "the household gadgets enjoin Belle to live with them," [...] comparing it heavily to the song [...] "Under the Sea" [...] from Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989), which was also written by Menken and Ashman. Longing to be human, servant and maître d' Lumiere is also of the impression that he is worth nothing unless he serves, singing,"Life is so unnerving/For a servant who's not serving." ...|$|E
