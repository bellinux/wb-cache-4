This conversion process is well understood in rocket engines where the high pressure combustion products expand through a nozzle generating high velocity exhaust gases. The propulsion community is now focusing on advanced concepts that utilize non-traditional forms of combustion like detonation. Such a device {{is called a}} pulse detonation engine in which laboratory tests have proven that thrust can be achieved through continuous cyclic operation. Because of poor performance of straight detonation tubes compared to conventional propulsion systems {{and the success of}} using nozzles on rocket engines, the effect of nozzles on detonation tubes is being investigated. Although previous studies of detonation tube nozzles have suggested substantial benefits, up to now there has been no systematic investigations over a range of operating conditions and nozzle configurations.

40|$|Purpose: The {{appearance}} {{western corn rootworm}} (Diabrotica virgifera LeConte) in Slovenia brings {{new challenges}} to machines used for pesticide spraying of corn.

The current paper presents the exploitation characteristics of mistblower with cannon and field sprayer with high-mounted spraying boom and vertical <b>tube</b> extension <b>with</b> distributing <b>nozzles</b> on pesticide distribution over the corn plant. Design/methodology/approach: Two field experiments with different air adjustments and driving speed (mistblower <b>with</b> cannon) and <b>nozzle</b> flow and driving speed (field sprayer with high-mounted spraying boom) were reserachFindings: The ventilator of the mistblower spread the pesticide over the wider band of the field as the field sprayer, however the pesticide distribution measured as coefficient of variation did not fulfil the legislative requirements. Research limitations/implications: The experiment results presented herein can be applied under similar equipment adjustment, working speed and growing conditions of the corn plant (78. 000 / ha and the height of 2. 70 m). Practical implications: The field sprayer with high-mounted spraying boom and vertical tube extension was proved as an efficient machine for controlling of western corn rootworm adults in the developed corn growing over 2. 70 m. With the presented technical procedure the damage caused by the western corn rootworm can be almost completely prevented. However due to the growing stage of the plant in the time of spreading of the adult, about 6. 5 % of the plants are overriddenOriginality/value: By implementing the findings from our experiments a severe damage in corn yield caused by the western corn rootworm can be reduced significantly.
