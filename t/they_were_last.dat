5|$|The {{expansion}} {{draft was}} largely {{made up of}} aging veterans, giving the Buccaneers little basis for success. The lack of medical information provided on players in the expansion draft contributed heavily to the team’s problems, as they finished the season with 17 players on injured reserve. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>last</b> {{in the league in}} points scored, touchdowns, and rushing touchdowns. After a 19-point 4th-quarter performance brought them within striking distance of a victory in week 8 against the Kansas City Chiefs, they were blown out of every game the rest of the season. Subsequent expansion teams were given a more generous allotment of draft picks and expansion draft opportunities, in part to avoid a repeat of the Buccaneers’ difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{tracking}} inland on July16, {{interaction with}} China's mountainous terrain disrupted {{the organization of}} Billie, weakening it down to tropical storm intensity. However, the tropical cyclone's stint over land was short-lived as the system quickly curved northward into the Yellow Sea by July17. Despite moving back over water, Billie continued to weaken, and made landfall on the western coast of North Korea with winds of 75km/h (40mph). Over the Korean peninsula, Billie began to intake cold air from a polar front, enabling the system to transition into an extratropical cyclone by 1800UTC that day. These remnants tracked eastward across the Sea of Japan before <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>last</b> noted just off of Hokkaido on July18.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} couple of days Beti {{continued}} to intensify as it moved towards New Caledonia, before the JTWC reported at 1800UTC on March 26, that Beti had reached its peak 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 195km/h (120mph). Six hours later, RSMC Nadi reported that the system had peaked as a category 4 severe tropical cyclone with 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 165km/h (105mph). Later on March 27, Severe Tropical Cyclone Beti made landfall on the Grande Terre island of New Caledonia near its peak intensity and quickly weakened into a category 2 tropical cyclone. During the next day, Beti moved towards the southeast under the influence of the trough, reemerging into the Coral Sea as a weakening tropical cyclone that had started to transition into an extratropical cyclone. Later on March 28, RSMC Nadi passed the primary warning responsibility of the cyclone to TCWC Wellington, before the JTWC issued their final advisory on Beti as it had become extratropical. Over the next few days, TCWC Wellington continued to monitor Beti's remnants, as they came under the influence of a high pressure area and moved around New Zealand's East Coast, before <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>last</b> noted on April 2 while located about 1400km (870mi) to the southeast of Wellington.|$|E

This single generator was not as powerful as the two used in the Mark 3 generator vans and was the main reason the sets were limited to 6 cars. Irish Mark 3 push-pull based rolling stock did not have air conditioning and had opening windows instead.

25|$|Following peak intensity, further {{strengthening}} was inhibited due to {{the emergence}} of a high pressure area over the United States Gulf Coast. The presence of this system injected dry air into Hilda, gradually weakening the hurricane. The once prominent eye of the storm clouded over {{as a result of this}} advection. During the evening hours of Octobernbsp&3, Hilda made landfall on the central Louisiana coast with a minimum pressure of 950nbsp&mbar (hPa; 28.06nbsp&inHg) and maximum sustained winds of , making it equivalent to a Categorynbsp&3 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Rapid weakening followed landfall as a result of the surrounding cold air; by 0600UTC on October4, Hilda had been downgraded to tropical storm intensity. The same area of high pressure which had weakened the tropical cyclone later forced Hilda eastward, resulting in the storm's merging with a cold front and thus transitioning into an extratropical cyclone later that day. These extratropical remnants continued to track eastward before <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>last</b> noted near Jacksonville, Florida on October5.|$|E
25|$|At {{this stage}} as the cyclone was moving towards the {{southwest}} it posed a severe threat to Vanuatu however, during that day Susan recurved towards {{the southeast and}} subsequently spared Vanuatu a direct hit. After sparing Vanuatu a direct hit, Susan started to accelerate towards the southeast and while starting to weaken significantly passed close enough to Fiji during January 7 and 8 to cause gale force winds in Fiji's southern and western islands. While continuing to move towards the southeast, Susan started to interact with Severe Tropical Cyclone Ron during January 8 before it absorbed Ron by 0600UTC {{the next day and}} starting to transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants of the combined systems were then monitored for another day until <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>last</b> noted on January 10, bringing an unseasonable cold snap to New Zealand. Despite sparing Vanuatu and Fiji direct hits, heavy rain and gale force winds associated with Susan were reported to have caused minor damage to several Vanuatuan and Fijian islands.

25|$|Favorable conditions, {{marked by}} very warm sea surface {{temperatures}} {{as high as}} 86ºFnbsp&(30ºC) {{and the presence of}} a large anticyclone over the system, allowed Frederic to strengthen to hurricane status for a second time while just northwest of Cuba, despite proximity to land. Frederic took a northwesterly course throughout its trek across the Gulf of Mexico in early September, intensifying in a highly conducive environment. By 1800nbsp&UTC on Septembernbsp&10, the hurricane became stronger than it had ever been over the central Atlantic. At 0000nbsp&UTC on Septembernbsp&12, Frederic attained major hurricane status over the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and twelve hours later reached peak intensity with a minimum barometric pressure of 943nbsp&mbar (hPa; 27.85nbsp&inHg) and sustained winds of 135nbsp&mph (215nbsp&km/h), making the cyclone a Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Moving gradually faster in the Gulf of Mexico, Frederic eventually made two landfalls– one on Dauphin Island and the other near the border between Alabama and Mississippi– with a virtually unchanged intensity. Tracking rapidly northward, Frederic began to weaken due to land interaction, and was downgraded to tropical storm status while it was near Meridian, Mississippi on September13. At around the same time, the cyclone began to curve northeastward, eventually merging with an extratropical cyclone in southwestern Pennsylvania by 1800UTC on September14. These extratropical remnants proceeded to track through the Mid-Atlantic states and New England before <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>last</b> officially documented by the NHC in New Brunswick on September15.

His day-to-day life was the most theatrical thing I had ever seen, ever. It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was. I joined the circus."

Satirising life in a British prison, meanwhile, the Bowie-penned [...] "Over the Wall We Go" [...] became a 1967 single for Oscar; another Bowie composition, [...] "Silly Boy Blue", was released by Billy Fury the following year. In January 1968, Kemp choreographed a dance scene for a BBC play The Pistol Shot in the Theatre 625 series, and used Bowie with a dancer, Hermione Farthingale; the pair began dating, and moved into a London flat together. Playing acoustic guitar, Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, Merseybeat, poetry and mime. Bowie and Farthingale broke up in early 1969 when she went to Norway {{to take part in a}} film, Song of Norway; this affected him, and several songs, such as [...] "Letter to Hermione" [...] and [...] "Life on Mars?"
