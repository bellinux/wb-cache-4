5|$|A {{prerequisite}} for natural selection {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation {{is the presence of}} heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|E
5|$|Other headgroups {{are also}} present {{to varying degrees}} and can include {{phosphatidylserine}} (PS) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). These alternate headgroups often confer specific biological functionality <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> context-dependent. For instance, PS presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis, whereas PS in growth plate vesicles {{is necessary for the}} nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization. Unlike PC, some of the other headgroups carry a net charge, which can alter the electrostatic interactions of small molecules with the bilayer.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{its native}} range, emerald ash borer is an {{invasive}} species <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> destructive to ash trees in its introduced range. Prior to emerald ash borer being found in North America, very little {{was known about}} emerald ash borer in its native range aside from a short description of life-history traits and taxonomic descriptions, which resulted in focused research on its biology in North America. Since its accidental introduction into the United States and Canada in the 1990s and its subsequent detection in 2002 in Canton, Michigan, it has since spread {{other parts of the}} North America. It is suspected that it was introduced from overseas in shipping materials such as packing crates.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of its over a millennium-long history, the mosque has been {{alternately}} neglected and highly regarded. Because it was founded as a Shiite Ismaili institution, Saladin and the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty that he founded shunned al-Azhar, removing {{its status as a}} congregational mosque and denying stipends to students and teachers at its school. These moves were reversed under the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule numerous expansions and renovations took place. Later rulers of Egypt showed differing degrees of deference to the mosque and provided widely varying levels of financial assistance, both to the school and to the upkeep of the mosque. Today, al-Azhar remains a deeply influential institution in Egyptian society <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> revered in the Sunni Muslim world and a symbol of Islamic Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Strontium is the {{chemical}} element with symbolSr and atomic number38. An alkaline earth metal, strontium is a soft silver-white yellowish metallic element <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> reactive chemically. The metal forms a dark oxide layer {{when it is}} exposed to air. Strontium has {{physical and chemical properties}} similar to those of its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table, calcium and barium. It occurs naturally in the minerals celestine, strontianite, and putnisite, and is mined mostly from the first two of these. While natural strontium is stable, the synthetic 90Sr isotope is radioactive {{and is one of the}} most dangerous components of nuclear fallout, as strontium is absorbed by the body in a similar manner to calcium. Natural stable strontium, on the other hand, is not hazardous to health.|$|E

5|$|Tantalum is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ta and atomic number 73. Previously known as tantalium, its {{name comes from}} Tantalus, a villain from Greek mythology. Tantalum is a rare, hard, blue-gray, lustrous transition metal <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> corrosion-resistant. It {{is part of the}} refractory metals group, which are widely used as minor components in alloys. The chemical inertness of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment and a substitute for platinum. Its main use today is in tantalum capacitors in electronic equipment such as mobile phones, DVD players, video game systems and computers.|$|E

5|$|The metal's {{distinctive}} natural green patina {{has long}} been coveted by architects and designers. The final patina is a particularly durable layer <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> resistant to atmospheric corrosion, thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering. It can be a mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts, depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain. Architectural copper and its alloys can also be 'finished' to embark a particular look, feel, and/or color. Finishes include mechanical surface treatments, chemical coloring, and coatings.|$|E

5|$|As a white-rot fungus, Panellus stipticus {{contains}} {{enzymes that}} {{are able to}} break down lignin, a complex aromatic polymer in wood <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> resistant to degradation by conventional enzyme systems. The major enzyme that initiates the cleavage of hydrocarbon rings is laccase, which catalyzes the addition of a hydroxyl group to phenolic compounds (polyphenols). The ring can then be opened between the two adjacent carbon atoms that bear the hydroxyl groups. White-rot fungi are being investigated scientifically for their potential use in the bioremediation of land contaminated by organic pollutants, and to convert industrial wastes rich in toxic polyphenols. Panellus stipticus has been shown to reduce the phenolic concentration of waste water produced by olive-processing plants—an environmental concern in many Mediterranean countries. In this study, a liquid culture of P.stipticus mycelia reduced the initial concentration of phenolic compounds by 42% after a 31-day incubation period. In a separate study, a P.stipticus culture was able to effectively degrade the environmental pollutant 2,7-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a polychlorinated dioxin.|$|E
5|$|Poland brought mercenaries from Moravia and Bohemia. The Czechs {{produced}} two full banners, {{under the command}} of Jan Sokol of Lamberk. Serving among the Czechs was possibly Jan Žižka, future commander of the Hussite forces. Alexander the Good, ruler of Moldavia, commanded an expeditionary corps. Vytautas gathered troops from Lithuanian, Ruthenian (modern Belarus and Ukraine) and Russian lands. The three Russian banners from Smolensk were {{under the command of}} Władysław II Jagiełło's brother Lengvenis, while the contingent of Tatars of the Golden Horde was under the command of the future Khan Jalal ad-Din. The overall commander of the joint Polish–Lithuanian force was King Władysław II Jagiełło; however, he did not directly participate in the battle. The Lithuanian units were commanded directly by Grand Duke Vytautas, who was second in command, and helped design the grand strategy of the campaign. Vytautas actively participated in the battle, managing both Lithuanian and Polish units. Jan Długosz stated that the low-ranking sword bearer of the Crown, Zyndram of Maszkowice, commanded the Polish army, but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> doubtful. More likely, marshal of the Crown Zbigniew of Brzezie commanded the Polish troops in the field.|$|E
5|$|Venom that is toxic only to {{a certain}} taxon, or {{strongly}} toxic {{only to a}} certain taxon, {{has been found in}} a number of snakes, suggesting that these venoms have evolved via natural selection to subdue preferred prey species. Examples of this phenomenon have been found in the Mangrove snake Boiga dendrophila, which has a venom specifically toxic to birds, {{as well as in the}} genera Echis and Sistrurus, and in sea snakes. However, while several snakes possess venom <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> toxic to their preferred prey species, the reverse correlation is not necessarily true: the venoms of several snakes are toxic to taxa that they do not consume in high proportions. Most snake venom, for instance, is highly toxic to lizards, although the proportion of lizard prey varies among snake species. This has led researchers to suggest that toxicity to a certain taxon is nearly independent of toxicity to another distantly related taxon.|$|E
