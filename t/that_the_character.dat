500|$|<b>The</b> game's <b>characters</b> {{polarized}} reviewers. Some felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> were inventive and interesting, {{while others}} {{noted that they}} lacked personality. Bendixsen of Good Game called <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> [...] "imaginative and wacky", while IGN's Moriarty felt that Oliver's uniqueness {{was one of the}} standout points of the game, and found that it made him care about <b>the</b> <b>character.</b> Destructoid's Sterling disliked Oliver, but found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> supporting <b>characters</b> compensate. Wallace of Game Informer felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> lack personality, and only exist to assist Oliver's journey. Joystiq's Kubba echoed similar remarks, stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> have [...] "the depth of a toothbrush". Similarly, the voice acting received mixed reactions; IGN's Moriarty felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> English voice for Oliver was the most disappointing, but praised the other voice acting, and Ian Dransfield of VideoGamer.com wrote <b>that</b> <b>the</b> English dub is [...] "worth hearing".|$|R

According to Rosalind, film producers George Lucas and Steven Spielberg contacted her after her father's death and conducted a series of interviews, during which she provided an account of his life.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} a significant decline in ratings and plans {{were made to}} take the series into a 'back to basics' approach where storylines would become less controversial {{and return to the}} focus on relationships and family dynamics. It was at this point <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of Declan was created and actress Jane Hall would play his on-screen mother Rebecca Napier. The characters were to create a family unit for then, already existing character Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin).|$|E
5|$|In 2016, a BBC Radio 4 {{documentary}} {{explored the}} possibility <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of James Bond {{was created by}} 20th Century author and mentor to Fleming, Phyllis Bottome in her 1946 novel, The Lifeline.

5|$|In February 2017, James Mangold {{stated that}} with the {{introduction}} of Laura / X-23 in Logan, there is a possibility <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> will appear in future films.

5|$|In {{producing}} the English dub {{version of the}} series, Media Blasters chose Lex Lang as Sanosuke's voice actor. When writing Sanosuke's dialogue, Clark Cheng, the writer of the English dub script, noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> was smarter {{than he would have}} liked in the first few episodes, so Cheng tried slowly to change the character's dialogue to make Sanosuke seem less intelligent so he would be more similar to the equivalent in the Japanese version of the series.|$|E

5000|$|Many of the {{exercises}} and phenomena involving lucid dreaming {{were taken from}} actual sleep research studies and exercises. <b>The</b> various methods <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> used {{to determine if they}} were dreaming are called induction techniques.

5|$|Multiple critics {{positively}} {{compared the}} character of Grant Ward, and his new position as a traitor and prisoner, to {{the character of}} Hannibal Lecter, though it was acknowledged that the situation would likely change in upcoming episodes.

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Rob LaZebnik, {{inspired}} by when his teenage son came out. Critical reception was mixed: the emotionally touching aspects of LaZebnik's script and Harry Shearer's portrayal of Smithers were praised. However, criticisms included the plot possibly ending the innuendo-driven humor involving Smithers' secret love of Burns, and an assumption <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> was being retconned due to changing attitudes on homosexuality since the series' debut. The episode was covered by international media.|$|E

5|$|Alice Ayres came to renewed {{public notice}} {{with the release}} of the 1997 play Closer by Patrick Marber and the 2004 BAFTA Award- and Golden Globe-winning film Closer based on it {{starring}} Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Jude Law and Clive Owen. A key plot element revolves around the memorial tablet to Ayres in Postman's Park, in which it is revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> Jane Jones (played by Portman in the film), who calls herself Alice Ayres for most of the story, has in fact fabricated her identity based on the tablet on the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice, which she reads {{at the time of her}} first meeting with Dan Woolf (played by Jude Law in the film) at the beginning of the action. The park, and the memorial to Ayres, feature prominently in the opening and closing scenes of the film.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{left the}} Black Order because the {{previous}} story arc {{had too many}} characters and required too much effort. Hoshino was pleased with her portrayal of Allen's farewell to comrade Lenalee Lee because it indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> had matured. She noted that Allen had grown taller; early in the series, he and Lenalee were the same height. Hoshino said that although Allen's departure fit the series' tragic theme, he would always have comrades. Allen and Kanda part on good terms in the previous story arc despite their frequent arguments, and Hoshino said that Kanda would assist him in the next storyline.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the time}} of Kameo release, lead {{designer}} George Andreas felt that the original Kameo concept of finding and using monsters had evolved and carried through to the final product.

Years later, Andreas reappraised and said that the game should never have been released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over. Andreas felt that the effort to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> did not match the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E
5|$|As in {{his other}} films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches. Trina first shows signs of greed on Easter Sunday and is murdered by McTeague on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve was often {{depicted}} in von Stroheim's films and {{was close to the}} date of his father's death. Lennig asserted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of McTeague's father (who was only briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim's own father, while McTeague's mother is a tribute to von Stroheim's mother, to whom Greed is dedicated. Von Stroheim stated that he considered all of his good qualities to have come from his mother and all of his bad qualities to have come from his father.|$|E

Chow is onscreen for twenty minutes in the uncensored theatrical release of the film.
