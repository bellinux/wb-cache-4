5|$|In 1991 the Labour MP Tony Benn {{placed a}} {{commemorative}} plaque inside <b>the</b> <b>cupboard</b> in which Davison had hidden eighty years earlier. In April 2013 a plaque was unveiled at Epsom racecourse {{to mark the}} centenary of her death. In January 2017 Royal Holloway announced that its new library would be named after her. The Women's Library, at the London School of Economics, holds several collections related to Davison. They include her personal papers and objects connected to her death.|$|E
5|$|The {{third day}} opens with Pikachu asleep in <b>the</b> <b>cupboard</b> and Oak expressing {{pleasure}} at the Pokémon's growing {{attachment to the}} player. On the fourth day, Pikachu invites its friends back over. Little else occurs on these two days besides visits to the snowy Mt. Snowfall and the tropical Cobalt Coast, although Oak does continue to laud the player's investment in the network, {{which has become a}} huge success.|$|E
5|$|A {{few feet}} {{to his right}} sits his wife, darning the clothes on her lap and those sprawled on the floor, while a crying infant, who is upset and hungry, goes {{unattended}} in the only bed. Next to the poet's wife, by the open door, an angry milkmaid presents her substantial bill, demanding payment for milk, underlining the poet's refusal to provide for his family by getting himself a proper job. <b>The</b> <b>cupboard</b> stands open and empty, save for a mouse; near the door, a dog steals {{the last of the}} family's food from a plate.|$|E
5000|$|Around 40,000 {{books from}} <b>the</b> <b>cupboards</b> of <b>the</b> library got {{circulated}} among children. <b>The</b> <b>cupboards</b> of <b>the</b> library became empty; many cupboard locks in school libraries {{had to be}} broken.|$|R
50|$|Henrietta discovers a {{creature}} {{that looks like}} a small flying rhino in one of <b>the</b> <b>cupboards.</b> This creature, called a raggant, was the one banging against his cupboard, causing it to break through the plaster {{at the beginning of the}} book. Uncle Frank tells Henry that he came from one of <b>the</b> <b>cupboards</b> as a child, and the raggant has been sent by someone to find him. Meanwhile, Nimiane has recovered and is plotting in one of the places beyond <b>the</b> <b>cupboards.</b> <b>The</b> book ends when Henry receives another threatening letter from the post office box.|$|R

5|$|That the gun had a {{silencer}} on {{it during}} the murders was central to the prosecution's case. With the silencer, the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned the gun on herself. According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed {{to have been made}} during a fight for the gun. That the silencer was found in the gun cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to <b>the</b> <b>cupboard</b> before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—has blighted the prosecution's case, even though it was accepted by a majority of the jury.|$|E
5|$|The {{police did}} not find the {{silencer}} in <b>the</b> <b>cupboard.</b> One of Bamber's cousins found it on 10 August, with {{what appeared to be}} flecks of red paint and blood, and took it to another of the cousin's homes; it took the police a further three days to collect it. A few days after that, it was the cousins who found a scratch on the red mantelpiece that the prosecution said was caused by the silencer during a struggle for the gun; that accounted for the fleck of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a hacksaw blade that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who had dealt with Bamber wrote down their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days after the murders, and three of them (June, Nevill and Sheila) were cremated. Bamber's clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later all blood samples were destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The {{sketches}} involving Diddy Dick and Diddy Dom {{tended to}} be either slapstick humour, puns or, more often than not, toilet humour. Eamonn Holmes was a guest inside <b>the</b> <b>cupboard</b> on two occasions, both times appearing as a head inside Diddy Dick and Dom's TV. According to the final episode, Diddy Dick and Dom left <b>the</b> <b>cupboard</b> to go to Hollywood. It {{was not until the}} final episode that Dick and Dom discovered their Diddy counterparts, and reacted in exaggerated terror.|$|E

50|$|Another night, {{the plaster}} from Henry's attic wall starts coming off, {{revealing}} two master lock dials {{to a hundred}} little locked cupboards. When they are home alone, Henry and Henrietta discover a key in one of <b>the</b> <b>cupboards</b> they have managed to open, which unlocks the door into Grandfather's bedroom. There they find a journal which has a map of <b>the</b> <b>cupboards.</b>|$|R
60|$|The smaller {{of the two}} keys {{instantly}} {{reminded me}} of <b>the</b> <b>cupboards</b> under <b>the</b> bookcase. I had strangely overlooked these. A vague distrust of the locked doors a vague doubt of what they might be hiding from me, stole into my mind. I left the ladder in its place against the wall, and set myself to examine the contents of <b>the</b> <b>cupboards</b> first.|$|R
25|$|Steatoda grossa, {{commonly}} known as <b>the</b> <b>cupboard</b> spider, the dark comb-footed spider, the brown house spider (in Australia), or the false black widow (though several other species are known by these names), is a common species of spider in the genus Steatoda.|$|E
25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in <b>the</b> <b>cupboard</b> for a year if {{airtight}} and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in <b>the</b> <b>cupboard.</b>|$|E
25|$|When Zeena {{leaves for}} an {{overnight}} {{visit to a}} doctor in a neighboring town, Ethan is excited to have an evening alone with Mattie. Mattie makes supper using Zeena's treasured pickle dish which she received as a wedding present. Unfortunately, the Fromes' cat jumps {{on the table and}} knocks off the pickle dish, shattering it beyond repair. Ethan decides to hide the damage until he is able to purchase glue by setting the dish's pieces neatly in <b>the</b> <b>cupboard.</b>|$|E

25|$|Inside the Bungalow {{was a large}} purple cupboard, {{and once}} or twice during each show, away from the {{attention}} of Dick, Dom and the Bungalow Heads, <b>the</b> <b>cupboard</b> doors would open to show the adventures of Diddy Dick and Dom. These were short pre-recorded sketches, {{no more than a}} minute in length, with Dick and Dom donning black clothes and attaching a small puppet's body around their necks. Both Diddy Dick and Diddy Dom spoke with very squeaky voices, edited in post production.|$|E
25|$|From 1986 to 1992, Jamaica won a {{total of}} six titles (three first class and three one-day), but in the {{thirteen}} seasons since then they have added four to <b>the</b> <b>cupboard,</b> despite completing the double in 1999–2000. In 2004–05, they came back after a two-year drought, however – with seven wins in ten regular season matches, they were 47 points ahead of runners-up Leeward Islands on the regular season table to win the Carib Beer Cup, before defeating the Leeward Islands by eight wickets in the final to take the Carib Beer Challenge title as well. However, this was followed up by a last-place finish the following season.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} match in the 1902 Cup Final Foulke protested to the {{officials}} that Southampton's equalising goal should not have been allowed. Foulke left his dressing room unclothed and pursued the referee, Tom Kirkham, who took refuge in a broom cupboard. Foulke had to be stopped by a group of F.A. officials from wrenching <b>the</b> <b>cupboard</b> door from its hinges to reach the hapless referee. In the replay, Sheffield United won 2–1, with Foulke being required to make several saves to keep United in the match. He was also in goal for United when they suffered an FA Cup exit to Second Division Burslem Port Vale in 1898.|$|E

500|$|The tale {{opens with}} an {{illustration}} of a wide-eyed kitten: [...] "This is a Pussy called Miss Moppet, she thinks she has heard a mouse!" [...] The following illustration depicts a mouse wearing a pink bowtie and green jacket [...] "peeping out behind <b>the</b> <b>cupboard,</b> and making fun of Miss Moppet. He is not afraid of a kitten." [...] Miss Moppet darts at him, but misses and bumps her head on <b>the</b> <b>cupboard.</b> She hits <b>the</b> <b>cupboard</b> very hard and rubs her nose. The mouse scurries {{to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>cupboard</b> and watches her.|$|E

While the Doctor discusses this with George's father Alex (Daniel Mays), Amy and Rory become trapped in a doll house with terrifying life-size peg dolls.|$|E
6000|$|Before one of <b>the</b> <b>cupboards</b> Victoire flung herself down, {{stretching}} out her arms, and, with a piercing shriek, cried, “Non, jamais, monsieur l’officier! Jamais! I will {{rather die than}} let you see this wardrobe.” ...|$|R
50|$|The {{sideboard}} is stylish and dramatic, {{but it is}} {{also quite}} appropriate for use in a dining room. It is functional with drawers, adjustable shelves, and a rack fitted to take a large dish between <b>the</b> <b>cupboards.</b> <b>The</b> construction and finish are practical and hygienic, with hard surfaces and simple decoration, and the raised bottom shelf gives access for cleaning the floor.|$|R

500|$|The defence {{also argued}} {{that people who have}} carried out {{so-called}} [...] "altruistic" [...] killings have been known to engage in ritualistic behaviour before killing themselves, and that Sheila might have placed the silencer in <b>the</b> <b>cupboard,</b> changed her clothes and washed herself, which would explain why there was little lead on her hands, or sugar from the floor on her feet. There was also a possibility that the blood in the silencer was not hers, but was a mixture of Nevill's and June's.|$|E
500|$|On 4 August 1985, {{three days}} before the murders, Sheila and the boys arrived at White House Farm to spend the week with June and Nevill. The {{housekeeper}} saw Sheila that day and noticed nothing unusual. Two farm workers, Julie and Leonard Foakes, saw her the following day with her children and said she seemed happy. One of the crime-scene photographs showed that someone had carved [...] "I hate this place" [...] into <b>the</b> <b>cupboard</b> doors of the bedroom in which the twins were sleeping.|$|E

[...] Van Peebles stated that [...] "story-wise, I came up with an idea, why not the direct approach. [...] To avoid putting myself into a corner and writing something I wouldn't be able to shoot, I made a list of the givens in the situation and tried to take those givens and juggle them into the final scenario." ...|$|E
