5|$|Serb sources {{assert that}} the first mujahideen began {{arriving}} in Kosovo {{in the spring of}} 1998, mainly from Bosnia and Herzegovina. By that summer, about 240 mujahideen were present in Kosovo and northern Albania. Most of these were ethnic Albanians, but the group also included several dozen Arabs from the Middle East and North Africa. According to the diary of the ambushed KLA group's leader, Ali Rabiçi, <b>the</b> <b>mujahideen</b> involved in the July 18 ambush had initially gathered in Munich before taking a ferry from Bari to the Albanian port city of Durrës. Once in Albania, <b>the</b> <b>mujahideen</b> were escorted to the frontier towns of Tropojë and Bajram Curri by their KLA handlers, where they rendezvoused with Rabiçi's men.|$|E
5|$|After the {{communist}} revolution in Afghanistan in 1978, authoritarian actions forced upon the populace by the Communist regime {{led to the}} Afghan civil war, with <b>the</b> <b>mujahideen</b> leading the popular backlash against the regime. The Soviet Union was worried that they were losing their influence in Central Asia, so after a KGB report claimed that Afghanistan could be taken {{in a matter of}} weeks, Brezhnev and several top party officials agreed to a full intervention in Afghanistan.|$|E

5000|$|The New York Times {{has stated}} that {{international}} security experts [...] "drew a blank on" [...] <b>the</b> Deccan <b>Mujahideen</b> group, with one analyst labelling it a [...] "front name", perhaps from a [...] "home-grown" [...] terrorist group, such as Indian <b>Mujahideen</b> (IM). <b>The</b> existence of a group calling itself <b>the</b> Deccan <b>Mujahideen</b> was unknown to intelligence agencies prior to the Mumbai attacks in November 2008 {{and the existence of}} <b>the</b> Deccan <b>Mujahideen</b> has not been verified. It may be an assumed name for another terrorist organization. Indian Islamic militants are known to issue hoax claims of responsibility in this fashion.|$|R

5|$|Koskov, Necros, Kara, and {{the captive}} Bond fly to a Soviet {{air base in}} Afghanistan, where Koskov betrays Kara and imprisons her along with Bond.

Bond and Milovy discover that Koskov is using Soviet funds to buy a massive shipment of opium from <b>the</b> <b>Mujahideen,</b> intending to keep the profits with enough left over to supply the Soviets with their arms and buy Western arms from Whitaker.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, a number of senior U.S. {{intelligence}} officials met {{with the leaders of}} the KLA, and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents arrived in northern Albania to monitor the fighting in Kosovo and assist in training rebel fighters. In exchange for American military, financial and intelligence support, KLA leaders promised not to carry out any actions outside Kosovo, not to continue participating in the drug trade, and not to accept help from Islamic radicals. Thus, the KLA ordered the 36 foreign Islamist fighters (or mujahideen) fighting in their ranks to leave Kosovo. Though few Kosovo Albanians sympathized with the Islamists, some argued that the KLA should have accepted assistance from any source, fundamentalist or otherwise. When KLA commanders ordered <b>the</b> <b>mujahideen</b> to leave, they refused, and disagreements arose within the KLA ranks as what was to be done with them.|$|E

5|$|On July 18, 1998 a Yugoslav Army (VJ) {{border patrol}} ambushed over 200 Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) insurgents and foreign mujahideen {{just west of}} Dečani, on the {{frontier}} between Albania and Yugoslavia. The ambush resulted {{in the deaths of}} four KLA fighters and 18 mujahideen (mostly citizens of Saudi Arabia). Another six KLA fighters were arrested by the Yugoslav authorities and charged with illegal entry and gunrunning. The VJ reported seizing a significant amount of arms and ammunition that the militants had been smuggling. One Yugoslav border guard was seriously wounded in the clash. According to Israeli historian Shaul Shay, the ambush represented the first clash of the Kosovo War between the VJ and foreign mujahideen. Human Rights Watch advisor Fred C. Abrahams suggests it is possible that <b>the</b> <b>mujahideen</b> were deliberately led into a trap by the KLA as part of a plan to reduce the influence of Islamic extremists within the KLA's ranks.|$|E
5|$|The Afghan people revolted {{against the}} PDPA {{government}} {{when the government}} introduced several socialist reforms, including land reforms. By early 1979, twenty-five out of Afghanistan's twenty-eight provinces were unsafe because of armed resistance against the government. On 29 March 1979, the Herat uprising began; the uprising turned the revolt into an open war between <b>the</b> <b>Mujahideen</b> and the Afghan government. It was during this period that Amin became Kabul's strongman. Shortly after the Herat uprising had been crushed, the Revolutionary Council convened to ratify the new Five-Year Plan, the Afghan–Soviet Friendship Treaty, and to vote {{on whether or not}} to reorganise the cabinet and to enhance the power of the executive (the Chairman of the Revolutionary Council). While the official version of events said that all issues were voted on democratically at the meeting, the Revolutionary Council held another meeting the following day to ratify the new Five-Year Plan and to discuss the reorganisation of the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|With the Mujahideen's help, Bond {{plants a}} bomb aboard the cargo plane {{carrying}} the opium, but is spotted {{and has no}} choice but to barricade himself in the plane. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Mujahideen</b> attack the air base on horseback and engage the Soviets in a gun battle. During the battle, Milovy drives a jeep into the back of the plane as Bond takes off, and Necros also leaps aboard at the last second. After a struggle, Bond throws Necros to his death and deactivates the bomb. Bond then notices Shah and his men being pursued by Soviet forces. He re-activates the bomb and drops it out of the plane and onto a bridge, blowing it up and helping Shah and his men gain an important victory over the Soviets. Bond returns to Tangier to kill Whitaker, infiltrating his estate with the help of his ally Felix Leiter, as Pushkin arrests Koskov, sending him back to Moscow.|$|E

25|$|The most effective, and largest, {{assaults on}} <b>the</b> <b>mujahideen</b> were {{undertaken}} during the 1985–86 period. These offensives had forced <b>the</b> <b>mujahideen</b> {{on the defensive}} near Herat and Kandahar. The Soviets ensued a bomb and negotiate during 1986, and a major offensive that year included 10,000 Soviet troops and 8,000 Afghan troops.|$|E
25|$|Some of <b>the</b> <b>mujahideen</b> funnelled {{arms and}} {{money into the}} country which Bosnia direly needed due to a United Nations-sanctioned arms embargo restricting the import of weapons into all of the republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. However, many of <b>the</b> <b>mujahideen</b> were {{extremely}} devout Muslims of the strict Salafi sect, which contrasted sharply with the widely renowned secular society and liberal attitude Bosnian Muslims harbored. This led to friction between <b>the</b> <b>mujahideen</b> and the Bosnians. Furthermore, some mujahideen wanted {{to fight a war}} of extermination, or use Bosnian territory as a base for terrorist operations elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>mujahideen</b> {{were deemed}} {{responsible}} for the decapitation of six young Russian conscripts caught in Dagestan during a rebel incursion. The beheading was filmed and then posted online.

50|$|<b>The</b> Indian <b>Mujahideen</b> {{terrorist}} group threatened in September 2008 {{to carry out}} bombings in Mumbai. Foreign Policy magazine has speculated {{that it is possible}} <b>the</b> Deccan <b>Mujahideen</b> organisation, if it exists, could be related to this organisation. On 21 September 2008, Delhi police raided Batla House and arrested members of Indian Mujahideen. This reputedly caused an indirect change to the timetable of the attack. When Batla House was raided, Delhi police claimed that there was a conspiracy between Indian <b>Mujahideen,</b> <b>the</b> Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), and Lashkar-e-Taiba (see below).|$|R

The Weekly Standard claimed, [...] "Indian intelligence believes <b>the</b> Indian <b>Mujahideen</b> is a front group created by Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami to confuse investigators and cover the tracks of the Students Islamic Movement of India, or SIMI, a radical Islamist movement with aim to establish Islamic rule over India. In the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, Kashmiri Muslim separatists opposing Indian rule are often known as mujahideen.|$|R
