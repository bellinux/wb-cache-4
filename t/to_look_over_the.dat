5|$|Steven Spielberg, {{one of the}} film's {{executive}} producers, {{visited the}} director and the writers during pre-production <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> script and the artwork. He provided Favreau {{with a collection of}} classic Western films. Spielberg also invited the director and the writers to a private screening of several Western films and provided live commentary on how to make one properly. The films included Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, and Destry Rides Again. Spielberg made several other suggestions: a main enemy alien, Jake's final use of the gauntlet being to decapitate an alien, and that Jake and Ella's first kiss should occur in the climax of the film.|$|E
5|$|The local legend {{suggests}} that the Cailleach and her family were given shelter in the glen by the locals and while they stayed there the glen was always fertile and prosperous. When they left they gave the stones to the locals with the promise {{that as long as}} the stones were put out <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> glen at Bealltainn and put back into the shelter and made secure for the winter at Samhainn then the glen would continue to be fertile.|$|E
5|$|Hard Target was Woo's first American {{film and}} {{was also the first}} major Hollywood film made by a Chinese {{director}}. Universal Pictures was nervous about having Woo direct a feature, and sent in director Sam Raimi <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> film's production and to take Woo's place as director if he were to fail. Woo went through several scripts finding mostly martial arts films with which he was not interested. After deciding on Chuck Pfarrer's script for Hard Target, Woo wanted to have actor Kurt Russell in the lead role, but found Russell too busy with other projects. Woo then went with Universal's initial choice of having Jean-Claude Van Damme star. Woo got along with Van Damme during filming and raised the amount of action in the film as he knew that Van Damme was up for it.|$|E

25|$|JDRF's role in {{quickening}} {{the development}} and availability of the Artificial Pancreas consists of funding research in order <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> outcomes of patients using the Artificial Pancreas, keeping close contact with the Food and Drug Administration so that {{the standards of the}} patient are met, advocating for health care coverage of technologies such as the Artificial Pancreas and working to ensure clinical acceptance of technologies such as the Artificial Pancreas. In 2011, JDRF strongly urged the FDA before Congress and in a petition to issue clear and reasonable guidance for an artificial pancreas by December 2011.|$|E
25|$|The video {{begins with}} a shot of a road in Paris and Adele is seen walking on it alone. She {{continues}} to walk and starts singing the song with a sad look as the camera makes circles and shots more locations in Paris including the Eiffel Tower. During the second chorus, Adele stops singing and pauses on the Pont Alexandre III <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Seine. She continues walking through the deserted streets during the bridge before finally entering a building in which she sees her ex-lover. After seeing her, he starts to walk away and several shots of Adele looking at him follow.|$|E

25|$|The Case Study Final Report is {{the main}} focus so that ideal {{preparation}} may take place.; this report does, after all, contain all the entomological findings and conclusions relevant to the case. The report should be detailed thoroughly, but should still allow room for speculation, because forensic entomology is still a relatively new science, {{and it would be}} a bit overzealous for the forensic entomologist to announce full certainty on the subject; said speculation should not exist when it comes to the evidence. Disclosure of this report to the opposing side before the trial is recommended so that the defense and/or prosecution have time to consult another expert witness <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> original findings.|$|E
25|$|Though {{aware of}} the {{weakness}} of his defense lines, Moreaux {{did not want to}} retreat, possibly because he was masking Jourdan's transfer of troops to the north. Kaiserslautern was held by the division of Jean-Jacques Ambert with eight battalions, a cavalry regiment and two squadrons of chasseurs à cheval. Many of the soldiers were raw recruits and some were not even armed. One of the few veteran battalions was commanded by Nicolas Oudinot. Anxious about the position, Moreaux sent Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr, an adjutant general whose advice he trusted, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> ground. Saint-Cyr advised Ambert to retreat but that general had orders to hold his ground though he had only 5,000 troops. Meanwhile, Möllendorf chose to make his main effort against Kaiserslautern.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the {{vacation}} season, the Phanceys entrust Viv with looking after the motel for the night before the owner, Mr. Sanguinetti, can arrive to take inventory and close it up for the winter. Two mobsters, [...] "Sluggsy" [...] Morant and Sol [...] "Horror" [...] Horowitz, both of whom work for Sanguinetti, arrive and say they are there <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> motel for insurance purposes. The two have been hired by Sanguinetti to burn down the motel so that Sanguinetti can make a profit on the insurance. The blame for the fire would fall on Viv, who was to perish in the incident. The mobsters are cruel to Viv and, when she says she does not want to dance with them, they attack her, holding her down and starting to remove her top. They are about to continue the attack with her rape when the door buzzer interrupts them.|$|E

5|$|Before {{each game}} and single-player Conquest, players choose between Sports and Action camera views. Action view is a {{trailing}} third-person shot similar <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> player-character's shoulder, while Sports view is a spectator perspective similar {{that of a}} televised basketball game. Enclosed arenas are inaccessible when using Sports view. The camera view cannot be changed once single-player begins, so Conquest mode players in Sports view will not see the arenas they unlock. The Action view camera swings wildly and can be pulled back slightly in the menus.|$|R
500|$|Although gruesome for {{the most}} part, some segments, such as [...] "Citizen Kang" [...] in [...] "Treehouse of Horror VII", satirize {{political}} issues. The opening segment of [...] "Treehouse of Horror XIX" [...] featured Homer attempting to vote for Barack Obama but a rigged electronic voting machine instead registers a vote for John McCain. Rather than taking sides in the election, Al Jean says it is [...] "mostly a comment on what many people to {{believe to be the}} irregularities in our voting system." [...] In [...] "Treehouse of Horror XVII", a segment called [...] "The Day the Earth Looked Stupid" [...] ends with Kang and Kodos taking over Springfield as part of a mission called [...] "Operation: Enduring occupation". The script originally called for Kodos and Kang <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> smoking ruins of Springfield and say [...] "This sure is a lot like Iraq will be." [...] The Fox network did not have any objection to the line, but it was rejected by some of the writers as too obvious and was cut from broadcast. While cut from the aired version, the line does appear in the [...] "review" [...] version sent to newspapers and magazines.|$|E

In effect the crew behind the gun shield were blind in Urban combat, suppressing fire and individual tanks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{commission}} {{determined that}} the accident had been {{the fault of the}} Kazakh Il-76 commander, who (according to FDR evidence) had descended from the assigned altitude of [...] and subsequently [...] and even lower. The report ascribed the cause of this serious breach in operating procedure to the lack of English language skills {{on the part of the}} Kazakh aircraft pilots; they were relying entirely on their radio operator for communications with the ATC. The radio operator did not have his own flight instrumentation but had <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> pilots' shoulders for a reading. Kazakh officials stated that the aircraft had descended while their pilots were fighting turbulence inside a bank of cumulus clouds.|$|E
2500|$|Badfinger toured America {{for three}} months in late 1970, and were {{generally}} well received, although the band were already weary of persistent comparisons to the Beatles.

[...] Rolling Stone critic Mike Saunders opined in a rave review of No Dice in 1970: [...] "It's as if John, Paul, George, and Ringo had been reincarnated as Joey, Pete, Tom, and Mike of Badfinger".

2500|$|As {{a result}} of this extreme need for NPs, they are also {{expected}} to receive more autonomy through lobbying for legislation, meaning that nurse practitioners would be able to fill the traditional primary care role like a physician would despite not having had to train like one. For an example, a nurse practitioner would be able to prescribe medication without the oversight of a doctor, which would be dangerous without appropriate pharmacology courses and examinations. Many states are passing laws that allow for independent practice of nurse practitioners due to the aggressive nurse lobby. [...] "Currently there are 12 states with active legislation looking at utilizing nurse practitioners {{at the top of their}} education to meet patient care needs," [...] said Dr. Tayin Kopanos with the American Association of Nurse Practitioners. Many nurses and other leaders in healthcare are advocating for overturning laws that require physicians <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> work of NPs.|$|E

Mr. O'Hara sent the investigator <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> pictures after he had received many complaints {{of the character of}} the show. [...] "We will not condemn the international exhibit without an impartial investigation," [...] said the lieutenant governor today. [...] "I have received many complaints, however, and we owe it to the public that the subject be looked into thoroughly." [...] The investigator reported that a number of the pictures were [...] "immoral and suggestive." [...] Senators Woodward and Beall of the commission will visit the exhibition today.

2500|$|On December 23, 1938, Hendrik Goosen, {{the captain}} of the trawler Nerine, {{returned}} to the harbour at East London, South Africa, after a trawl between the Chalumna and Ncera Rivers. As he frequently did, he telephoned his friend, Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, curator at East London's small museum, to see if she wanted <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> contents of the catch for anything interesting, and told her of the strange fish he has set aside for her. Correspondence in the archives of the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (SAIAB, formerly the JLB Smith Institute of Ichthyology) show that Goosen {{went to great lengths to}} avoid any damage to this fish and ordered his crew to set it aside for the East London Museum. [...] Goosen later told how the fish was steely blue when first seen, but by the time the 'Nerine' entered East London harbour many hours later, the fish had become dark grey.|$|E
