25|$|Lyra Belacqua, aged around eleven at the {{beginning}} of the trilogy, is the daughter of Lord Asriel and Marisa Coulter in a fictional Oxford, similar to our own.

25|$|Wang sent {{messengers}} issuing pardons {{in hopes}} of causing these rebels to disband. Once the messengers returned to the Xin capital Chang'an, some honestly reported that the rebels gathered because the harsh laws {{made it impossible for}} them to make a living and therefore they were forced to rebel. Some, in order to flatter Wang Mang, told him that these were simply evil resistors who needed to be killed, or that this was a temporary phenomenon. Wang listened to those who flattered him and generally relieved those who told <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>from</b> their posts. Further, Wang made no further attempts to pacify the rebels, but instead decided to suppress them by force. In reality, the rebels were forced into rebellion to survive, and they were hoping that eventually, when the famine was over, they could return home to farm. As a result, they never dared to attack cities.|$|E
