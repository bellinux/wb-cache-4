Let's not chase radio. We're not trying to get radio hits. We're not <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> we can have a song that anybody could sing." [...] So that's what Anti is. Let's just do good work, because we love doing what we do, and we get to make music to it.|$|E

Then {{he sat up}} very {{straight}} and looked this way and looked that way, just as if <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> no one was watching him. Then he emptied two pocketfuls of shining yellow gravel on to a nice new mound which he was building. Once more {{he sat up and}} looked this way and looked that way. Then he scuttled back towards the old log. As he ran Striped Chipmunk chuckled and chuckled to himself, for all the time he had seen Peter Rabbit lying flat down behind a little bush and knew that Peter Rabbit was thinking to himself how smart he had been to find Striped Chipmunk's home when no one else knew where it was.|$|E

60|$|The sound stopped, a {{board in}} the passage creaked, and as the shock of alarm began to pass, Elsie guessed that it was Staffer <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> {{she was in her}} room. This implied that he was going downstairs to meet some one; but she waited until she got calmer, {{wondering}} if, after all, she had been mistaken. Staffer could not have returned until late, and it was strange he had allowed his visitor to risk coming to the house when he might be out. She tried to believe he had not done so; but when she heard a faint tap on the other door, which opened into Madge's room, there was no longer any doubt. Nerving herself for a painful effort, she got up and hastily put on some clothes. Then she went into the other room and saw Madge's shadowy figure standing by the window.|$|E

Mærsk wanted to the building to have several features in its design: it would not become obsolete in function and appearance due to any fiscal compromise. He personally tested seats and materials, he visited many {{places in the world}} to see how opera buildings were constructed and how the building materials were looking after having been exposed over time to weather.

Because Mercury is so close to the Sun, all Mercurians have a tendency to [...] "look on the bright side" [...] of things, and as a result, Rosie is the mothering influence within the crew, always <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> her fellow cadets are happy and getting along.

50|$|However, Ishwar {{has done}} {{all this for}} a reason and is hiding something.
