5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing to}} employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, <b>to</b> <b>institutionalize</b> it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, Mesa resigned, {{citing the}} {{pressure}} of Morales and the cocalero road blocks and riots. Amid fears of civil war, Eduardo Rodríguez became President of a transitional government, preparing Bolivia for a general election in December 2005. Hiring the Peruvian Walter Chávez as its campaign manager, the MAS electoral campaign was based on Salvador Allende's successful campaign in the Chilean presidential election, 1970. Measures were implemented <b>to</b> <b>institutionalize</b> the party structure, giving it greater independence from the social movement; this was done to allow Morales and other MAS leaders to respond quickly to new developments without the lengthy process of consulting the bases, and to present a more moderate image away from the bases' radicalism. Although he had initially hoped for a female running mate, Morales eventually chose Marxist intellectual Álvaro García Linera as his Vice Presidential candidate, with some Bolivian press speculating as to a romantic relationship between the two. MAS' primary opponent was Jorge Quiroga and his center-right Social and Democratic Power, whose campaign was centered in Santa Cruz and which advocated continued neo-liberal reform; Quiroga accused Morales of promoting the legalization of cocaine and being a puppet for Venezuela.|$|E

25|$|Patrick Olivelle {{suggests}} that the Hindu ashrama system of life, created probably around the 4th-century BCE, was an attempt <b>to</b> <b>institutionalize</b> renunciation within the Brahmanical social structure. This system gave complete freedom to adults to choose {{what they want to}} do, whether they want to be householders or sannyasins (ascetics), the monastic tradition was a voluntary institution. This voluntary principle, states Olivelle, was the same principle found in Buddhist and Jain monastic orders at that time.|$|E

25|$|The {{notion of}} {{development}} {{emerged in the}} 1940s and 1950s out of the post-World War II context in which a new international economic order was established, the United States made contributions to European reconstruction, and attention to the post-colonial Third World increased. The United States included among its aims in World War I the defense of democracies, and after WWII attempted <b>to</b> <b>institutionalize</b> democratic systems in countries that had lost the war (such as Germany and Japan); meanwhile during the Cold War, democracy promotion was a distant goal, with security concerns and a centering of policy against Soviet expansion dominating. President Jimmy Carter applied limited diplomatic pressure, {{which resulted in a}} conservative backlash resistant to criticism of authoritarian allies, while President Reagan selectively supported anti-communist democratic transition in countries such as El Salvador, the Philippines, and South Korea.|$|E
25|$|After {{evaluating}} AA's {{literature and}} observing AA meetings for sixteen months, sociologists David R. Rudy and Arthur L. Greil {{found that for}} an AA member to remain sober {{a high level of}} commitment is necessary. This commitment is facilitated by a change in the member's worldview. To help members stay sober AA must, they argue, provide an all-encompassing worldview while creating and sustaining an atmosphere of transcendence in the organization. To be all-encompassing AA's ideology places an emphasis on tolerance rather than on a narrow religious worldview that could make the organization unpalatable to potential members and thereby limit its effectiveness. AA's emphasis on the spiritual nature of its program, however, is necessary <b>to</b> <b>institutionalize</b> a feeling of transcendence. A tension results from the risk that the necessity of transcendence, if taken too literally, would compromise AA's efforts to maintain a broad appeal. As this tension {{is an integral part of}} AA, Rudy and Greil argue that AA is best described as a quasi-religious organization.|$|E
25|$|As Hoxha began {{experiencing}} more health problems, he progressively started {{withdrawing from}} state affairs and taking {{longer and more}} frequent leaves of absence. Meanwhile, he began planning for an orderly succession. He worked <b>to</b> <b>institutionalize</b> his policies, hoping to frustrate any attempt his successors might make to venture from the Stalinist path he had blazed for Albania. In December 1976, Albania adopted its second Stalinist constitution of the postwar era. The document guaranteed Albanians freedom of speech, the press, organization, association, and assembly but subordinated these rights to the individual's duties to society as a whole. The constitution continued to emphasize national pride and unity, and enshrined in law the idea of autarky and prohibited the government from seeking financial aid or credits or from forming joint companies with partners from capitalist or revisionist communist countries. The constitution's preamble also boasted that the foundations of religious belief in Albania had been abolished.|$|E

25|$|Freshly graduated, {{launching}} his law {{career and}} {{active in the}} local Circol Jaumista, in 1920 Caylà ran on the Carlist ticket in elections to the municipal council, but was reprimanded by the party leader of the province, Joaquín Avellá, who made public that Caylà had not been nominated by the party. Local Carlists responded by claiming that Avellá only intended to favour the candidacy of his own brother, {{a member of the}} Conservative Party. Caylà could not get elected. However, in 1922 he ran again and was elected regidor {{as one of the most}} popular candidates. His career did not last long; the coming of the Primo de Rivera dictatorship in 1923 spelled replacement of elected bodies with the appointees; Joventut could have only lambasted the new regime for its corrupted political machinery. Things went from bad to worse in 1924, when Caylà and the young Jaimistas attempted to stage Festa dels Veterans and celebrate the 50th anniversary of Carlist takeover of the province; the regime reacted by closing circulos, suspending Joventut for 2 weeks and detaining Caylà, who spent 5 days in Tarragona prison and was ordered a month of exile in Lleida. Also during the years to come Joventut refused to endorse attempts <b>to</b> <b>institutionalize</b> the regime and rebuked its inefficiency and disregard for genuine representation, in result suffering 5 fines, 2 suspensions and 2 detentions.|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s {{the kibbutz}} {{suffered}} from the bank stock crisis. [...] The end of the crisis began {{in the end of}} the decade, and Tama began manufacturing plastic netting used for bundling crops. Several successful business moves by Tama in the early 1990s led the kibbutz to an era of economic prosperity and high quality of life. At that time, education in the kibbutz was reformed and the children societies were abolished and the students were moved to schools outside of the kibbutz. This led the kibbutz to extend existing houses and set up new neighborhoods. The prosperity has led the kibbutz to increase the salaries of its members, to create personal funds for families and <b>to</b> <b>institutionalize</b> culture and recreation activities, as the number of work days per week was reduced to five.|$|E

500|$|According to Rothstein's {{assessment}} of Hubbard's legacy, Scientology consciously aims {{to transfer the}} charismatic authority of Hubbard <b>to</b> <b>institutionalize</b> his authority over the organization, even after his death. Hubbard {{is presented as a}} virtually superhuman religious ideal just as Scientology itself is presented as the most important development in human history. As Rothstein puts it, [...] "reverence for Scientology's scripture is reverence for Hubbard, the man who in the Scientological perspective single-handedly brought salvation to all human beings." [...] David G. Bromley of the University of Virginia comments that the real Hubbard has been transformed into a [...] "prophetic persona", [...] "LRH", which acts as the basis for his prophetic authority within Scientology and transcends his biographical history. According to Dorthe Refslund Christensen, Hubbard's hagiography directly compares him with Buddha. Hubbard is viewed as having made Eastern traditions more accessible by approaching them with a scientific attitude. [...] "Hubbard is seen as the ultimate-cross-cultural savior; he is thought to be able to release man from his miserable condition because he had the necessary background, and especially the right attitude." ...|$|E
500|$|Clinton {{spent her}} initial days as Secretary of State telephoning dozens of world leaders and {{indicating}} that U.S. foreign policy would change direction: [...] "We {{have a lot}} of damage to repair." [...] She advocated an expanded role in global economic issues for the State Department and cited the need for an increased U.S. diplomatic presence, especially in Iraq where the Defense Department had conducted diplomatic missions. Clinton announced the most ambitious of her departmental reforms, the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, which establishes specific objectives for the State Department's diplomatic missions abroad; it was modeled after a similar process in the Defense Department that she was familiar with from her time on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The first such review was issued in late 2010 and called for the U.S. leading through [...] "civilian power" [...] as a cost-effective way of responding to international challenges and defusing crises. It also sought <b>to</b> <b>institutionalize</b> goals of empowering women throughout the world. A cause Clinton advocated throughout her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world, to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women.|$|E
