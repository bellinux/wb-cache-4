We consider two different mechanisms that could underlie nanometer-scale strain variations: static perturbations from lattice imperfections of an underlying substrate and thermal fluctuations.

Reflecting the non-linear elastic properties of graphene, both trends together yield a non-monotonic variation of the <b>total</b> <b>displacements</b> with increasing tensile strain.
