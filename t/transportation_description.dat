40|$|International audienceEnvironmental {{performance}} {{considerations in}} the construction sector extend from buildings to neighbourhoods, cities and territory. This transition implies a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) adaptation to efficiently treat such complex systems. Indeed, performing environmental performance evaluations {{has already been done}} {{over the past few years}} but the existing LCA tools have to be improved regarding their userfriendliness to allow everyday urban planning stakeholders to use them. Providing keys to help the practice is a main subject to spread the large scale LCA evaluation and ensure a better urban planning trending to sustainable solutions. This objective is also motivated by local, national and European policies, particularly within the context of Paris COP 21. The aim of this study is to explore enhancement perspectives to facilitate LCA scaling up from building to territory. This work is based on observations from case studies underlining operational issues due to the evaluation time consumption. The urban planning process is analysed to focus, at different stages, on operational responses that could be proposed considering objectives, stakeholders’ needs and potential drivers. In particular, for early stage decision making, an approach introducing urban typo-morphologies has been adopted to facilitate the comparison of large scale evaluations and scenarios. Such typo-morphologies, representing elemental bricks at building or block scale to build neighbourhoods or larger, have been widely described in the past. However, this work concentrates on the applicability of the approach to integrate this sort of description for environmental evaluation based on a multicomponent (buildings, energy, water, public spaces, <b>transportation)</b> <b>description</b> of the systems. Particularly, a focus has to be given to scaling up mechanism. Expert systems sets on heuristic rules could help exploiting a typo-morphologies database. This solution should ease the practice of urban environmental assessments...|$|E

The decision making algorithms have {{to provide us with}} not only vehicles’ approach time prediction, at the intersections but also finding possible solution for avoiding critical queues at the intersections. Majority of traditional traffic control systems are based on number of cars recorded by inductive loops, however they do not define any proper occupation states at any traffic lane. The time window indicated for passing the defined number of cars loses the distance gaps visible between the cars on the traffic lane. That is why remarkable part from the defined number of cars will not cross the intersection in the defined green light time. Procedures used for searching an optimal solution using the inductive measurements can, in the majority cases, be undoubtedly noticed as a theoretical analysis only...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} the propagation of uncertainty in a knowledge-based system that assesses energy management strategies for new gas and electric technologies that can help reduce energy consumption and demand. The new technologies that have been investigated include lighting, electric heat pumps, motors, refrigerators, microwave clothes dryers, freeze concentration, electric vehicles, gas furnaces, gas heat pumps, engine-driven chillers, absorption chillers, and natural gas vehicles distributed throughout the residential, commercial, industrial, and <b>transportation</b> sectors;The <b>description</b> of a complex assessment system may be simplified by allowing some degree of uncertainty. A number of uncertainty-representing mechanisms, such as probability theory, certainty factors, Dempster-Shafer theory, fuzzy logic, rough sets, non-numerical methods, and belief networks, were reviewed and compared. The proper application of uncertainty provides an effective and efficient way to represent knowledge;A knowledge-based system has been developed to assess the impacts of rebate programs on customer adoption of new technologies and, hence, the reductions in energy and demand. Three modes have been programmed: (1) one in which uncertainty is not considered, (2) another where fuzzy logic with linguistic variables is used to represent uncertainty, and (3) one in which uncertainty is represented using Dempster-Shafer theory with basic probability assignments. A correlation for rebate, expected (energy) savings, and customer adoption is employed in the knowledge base. Predictions for annual adoption of a new technology are made for specified useful life, rebate, and expected savings; or a suggested rebate can be determined for specified useful life, expected savings, and annual adoption. With input for energy use and demand for each technology, the impacts of rebate programs on energy use and power demand can be evaluated;This report and the knowledge-based system should help utilities determine these new technologies that are most promising and these strategies that should be emphasized in their energy management programs...|$|R
40|$|Results of a month-long {{study in}} Morocco aimed at {{assessing}} the market potential for stand-alone photovoltaic systems in agriculture and rural service applications are presented. The following applications, requiring less than 15 kW of power, are described: irrigation, cattle watering, refrigeration, crop processing, potable water and educational TV. Telecommunications and <b>transportation</b> signalling applications, <b>descriptions</b> {{of power and}} energy use profiles, assessments of business environment, government and private sector attitudes towards photovoltaics, and financing were also considered. The Moroccan market presents both advantages and disadvantages for American PV manufacturers. The principle advantages of the Moroccan market are: a limited grid, interest in and present use of PV in communications applications, attractive investment incentives, and a stated policy favoring American investment. Disadvantages include: lack of government incentives for PV use, general unfamiliarity with PV technology, high first cost of PV, a well-established market network for diesel generators, and difficulty with financing. The market for PV in Morocco (1981 - 1986), will be relatively small, about 340 kwp. The market for PV {{is likely to be}} more favorable in telecommunications, transport signalling and some rural services. The primary market appears to be in the public (i. e., government) rather than private sector, due to financial constraints and the high price of PV relative to conventional power sector...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{diagnostics}} develop {{through different}} phases that span from test ordering (pre-preanalytical phase), collection of diagnostic specimens (preanalytical phase), sample analysis (analytical phase), results reporting (postanalytical phase) and interpretation (post-postanalytical phase). Although laboratory medicine seems less vulnerable than other clinical and diagnostic areas, {{the chance of}} errors is not negligible and may adversely impact on quality of testing and patient safety. This article, which continues a biennial tradition of collective papers on preanalytical quality improvement, is aimed to provide further contributions for pursuing quality and harmony in the preanalytical phase, and is a synopsis of lectures of the third European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (EFLM) -Becton Dickinson (BD) European Conference on Preanalytical Phase meeting entitled 'Preanalytical quality improvement. In pursuit of harmony' (Porto, 20 - 21 March 2015). The leading topics that will be discussed include unnecessary laboratory testing, management of test request, implementation of the European Union (EU) Directive on needlestick injury prevention, harmonization of fasting requirements for blood sampling, influence of physical activity and medical contrast media on in vitro diagnostic testing, recent evidence about the possible lack of necessity {{of the order of}} draw, the best practice for monitoring conditions of time and temperature during sample <b>transportation,</b> along with <b>description</b> of problems emerging from inappropriate sample centrifugation.
