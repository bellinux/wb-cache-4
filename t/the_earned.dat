5|$|Scholars {{have often}} {{connected}} {{the notion of}} karma to the determinism in the caste system in India. Just like {{in the case of}} karma, some scholars believe that a belief in merit can cause social differences to stay unchanged. This would be the case when the poor, who cannot make much merit, resign to their fate. Other scholars point out that merit can be used to improve social status in the present, {{as in the case of}} someone ordaining as a monk for a few years. And vice versa, if someone's social status quickly deteriorates, for example, due to quick changes in the bureaucratic structure, these changes might be justified in Buddhist societies because someone's store of merit is believed to have run out. Someone's position in society, even in the cosmos, is always subject to the impermanent workings of merit and demerit. In traditional Buddhist societies, quick changes in position, status, or roles are therefore considered part of life, and this insecurity is a motivator in trying to improve the situation through merit-making. Findly points out that in Buddhist ideals of merit-making, <b>the</b> <b>earned</b> value gained by doing good deeds is more important than the assigned value gained by social status at birth.|$|E

The rats could either collect and immediately consume or accumulate (defined {{as the percentage of}} multiple earn responses and as the number of pellets earned before a collect response) earned pellets. In Experiment 1, accumulation varied as a function of variations in <b>the</b> <b>earn</b> or collect response requirements and whether <b>the</b> <b>earn</b> and collect levers were proximal (31 cm) or distal (248 cm) to one another. Some accumulation occurred under {{all but one of the}} conditions, but generally was higher when <b>the</b> <b>earn</b> and collect levers were distal to one another, particularly when <b>the</b> <b>earn</b> response requirement was fixed-ratio (FR) 1. In Experiment 2, the contributions of responses and time to accumulation were assessed by comparing an FR 20 earn response requirement to a condition in which only a single earn response was required at the end of a time interval nominally yoked to the FR interval. When 248 cm separated <b>the</b> <b>earn</b> and collect levers, accumulation was always greater in the FR condition, and it was not systematically related to reinforcement rate. In Experiment 3, increasing <b>the</b> <b>earn</b> response requirement with a progressive-ratio schedule that reset only with a collect response increased the likelihood of accumulation when <b>the</b> collect and <b>earn</b> levers were 248 cm apart, even though such accumulation increased <b>the</b> next <b>earn</b> response requirement.

40|$|The {{economic}} value {{of investment in}} education has typically been measured by its rate of return, frequently estimated by the {{internal rate of return}} or <b>the</b> <b>earning</b> function approach. Given the importance of the rate of return estimates for individuals and countries, especially developing countries, in making decision on educational investment, we need to know how these methods compare as empirical researchers have used only one method, mainly due to data constraints. This study presents and compares the rate of return estimates obtained from these two methods using household data‐sets that have been typically employed in such studies. The results of the study confirm the previously established stylized facts about the rate of return to education. In addition, the internal rate of return approach exhibits ‘diminishing returns’ to schooling, reflecting ever rising cost of higher increments of schooling, while <b>the</b> <b>earning</b> function approach yields the opposite pattern, reflecting the greater relative increase associated in earnings with additional schooling. Moreover, the rate of return is greater using the internal rate of return approach than <b>the</b> <b>earning</b> function approach. Finally, the internal rate of return approach reveals a more accurate estimate of <b>the</b> <b>earning</b> return to <b>the</b> actual amount invested in schooling, whereas <b>the</b> <b>earning</b> function approach is more thorough in measuring earning differences associated with additional schooling. cost of education, economics of education, investment in human capital, rate of return, Turkey,...|$|R
