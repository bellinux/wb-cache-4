25|$|Blunt's {{first year}} in office was difficult, and he was criticized by both <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left.</b> In February 2006, a poll {{conducted}} by SurveyUSA showed him with a 33% job approval rating, the fifth lowest of any governor in the nation. His approval among Republicans polled was 62%, but his rating among Democrats was only 12%. This {{was one of the greatest}} partisan divides of any governor.|$|E
25|$|The two-tiered Holy Ark on {{the eastern}} wall was a splendid structure, {{intricately}} carved with gilded woodcarvings, representing plants, animals and Jewish symbols, with a double-headed eagle on top. It was approached by a twofold flight of steps, with iron balustrades, ascending from <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left.</b> Hanging from the walls and ceilings there were numerous bronze and silver chandeliers. The synagogue contained a valuable collection of ritual objects. The building was repaired in the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1929 crash, 450,000 {{people were}} unemployed. In {{the same year}} Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party won its first seats in the city parliament. Nazi Propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels became Gauleiter (party {{district}} leader) of Berlin in 1926. On July 20, 1932, the Prussian government under Otto Braun in Berlin was dismissed by presidential decree. The republic was nearing its breakdown, under attack by extreme forces from <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left.</b> On January 30, 1933, Hitler became Chancellor of Germany.|$|E
25|$|The {{fracture}} of mandible involved the midline and the adjacent {{part of the}} left mandible. Her right and left first incisors and the left canine tooth were affected by this fracture. The sockets of the right second incisor, the left first molar, and the left second molar are empty, with these teeth missing. The first and second left upper molars are partially fractured. Both <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> upper third molars are nonerupted. Conversely, the Lady's upper right canine, premolars, first molar, and second molar are still present. This group of teeth has no visible attrition, and no occlusal irregularity of their surface.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} protests {{followed}} the coup, and initially the military's response was mild. However, on 7 July 1962, a peaceful student protest on Rangoon University campus was suppressed by the military, killing over 100 students. The next day, the army {{blew up the}} Students Union building. Peace talks were convened between the RC and various armed insurgent groups in 1963, but without any breakthrough, and during the talks {{as well as in}} the aftermath of their failure, hundreds were arrested in Rangoon and elsewhere from both <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> of the political spectrum. All opposition parties were banned on 28 March 1964. The Kachin insurgency by the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO) had begun earlier in 1961 triggered by U Nu's declaration of Buddhism as the state religion, and the Shan State Army (SSA), led by Sao Shwe Thaik's wife Mahadevi and son Chao Tzang Yaunghwe, launched a rebellion in 1964 as a direct consequence of the 1962 military coup.|$|E

25|$|On {{the third}} day, Bhishma {{arranged}} the Kaurava {{forces in the}} formation of an eagle with himself leading from the front, while Duryodhana's forces protected the rear. Bhishma wanted to be sure of avoiding any mishap. The Pandavas countered this by using the crescent formation with Bhima and Arjuna at the head of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> horns, respectively. The Kauravas concentrated their attack on Arjuna's position. Arjuna's chariot was soon covered with arrows and javelins. Arjuna, with amazing skill, built a fortification around his chariot with an unending stream of arrows from his bow. Abhimanyu and Satyaki combined to defeat the Gandhara forces of Shakuni. Bhima and his son Ghatotkacha attacked Duryodhana in the rear. Bhima's arrows hit Duryodhana, who swooned in his chariot. His charioteer immediately drove them out of danger. Duryodhana's forces, however, saw their leader fleeing the battlefield and soon scattered. Bhishma soon restored order and Duryodhana returned to lead the army. He was angry at Bhishma, however, at what he saw as leniency towards the five Pandava brothers and spoke harshly at his commander. Bhishma, stung by this unfair charge, fell on the Pandava army with renewed vigor. It was as if there were more than one Bhishma on the field.|$|E

Advocacy of communism was illegal in the Russian Empire, the German Empire and Austria-Hungary, the three most powerful monarchies in continental Europe prior to World War I. Many monarchists (except constitutional monarchists) viewed inequality in wealth and political power as resulting from a divine natural order.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} Kongzi’s {{religious}} ethics suggests an alternative {{way of understanding}} <b>the</b> relationship between <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> good, in which neither takes clear precedence {{in terms of being}} more foundational for ethics. The religious underpinnings of Kongzi’s understanding of the Way are examined, including the close relationship between tian (“Heaven”) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Way. It is shown that following the Way is defined primarily by the extent to which one’s actions express certain virtues, and not whether one’s actions are conducive to the best overall outcome or whether they are inherently right irrespective of consequences. It is then argued that the Way is seen as constitutive of both <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> good, <b>and</b> that this understanding of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> good has impor-tant implications for contemporary virtue ethics, religious ethics, and political philosophy...|$|R

Givenchy was recaptured by the British on 16 October, Violaines was taken and a foothold established on Aubers Ridge on 17 October; French cavalry captured Fromelles. On 18 October, German resistance increased as the German XIII Corps arrived, reinforced the VII Corps and gradually forced the II Corps to a halt. On 19 October, British infantry and French cavalry captured Le Pilly (Herlies) but were forced to retire by German artillery-fire.|$|E

[...] A nationalist historian, Nicolae Iorga, accused Nour of promoting [...] "class fraternity" [...] between the Russians and the Romanians in Bessarabia, citing Nour's explicit rejection of the Russian Revolution. Nour enlisted other negative comments from Iorga when he began writing Bessarabian notices in the Romanian daily Adevărul, which had Jewish proprietors. Iorga, an antisemite, commented: [...] "Mr. Alexe Nour of Chișinău assures us now that his new gazette [...] will not be a philosemitic one". According to Iorga, Nour was given reason to [...] "feel sorry" [...] about the Adevărul collaboration.|$|E
2500|$|Out of office, Bevan soon {{exacerbated}} the split within the Labour Party between <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left.</b> For {{the next five}} years, Bevan {{was the leader of}} the left wing of the Labour Party, who became known as Bevanites. They criticised high defence expenditure (especially for nuclear weapons), called for better relations with the Soviet Union, and opposed the party leader, Attlee, on most issues. [...] According to Richard Crossman Bevan hated [...] "the in-fighting which you have to do in politics.... He wasn't cut out to be a leader, he was cut out to be a prophet." [...] In 1954, Gaitskell defeated Bevan in a hard fought contest to be the Treasurer of the Labour Party. In March 1955, when Britain was preparing for tests of its first hydrogen bomb, Bevan led a revolt of 57 Labour MPs and abstained on a key vote. The Parliamentary Labour Party voted 141 to 113 to withdraw the whip from him, but it was restored within a month due to his popularity.|$|E

It applies to both domesticated and wild animals, and to both <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> hip. But it does not apply to birds, because they have no spoon-shaped hip as the muscles upon the hip bone (femur) of a bird lie flat and are not raised and convex like those of cattle. It also applies to a live fetus found in a slaughtered animal, although Rabbi Judah said that it does not apply to a fetus. And the live fetus' fat is permitted.
