40|$|Modeling {{a utility}} furnace firing heavy {{residual}} fuel oil is challenging due to the complex process associated with oil combustion, including <b>droplet</b> <b>spray</b> <b>patterns,</b> <b>droplet</b> heat up and vaporization, gas phase combustion of vaporized oil, enhanced radiative heat transfer due to potentially high soot levels, cenosphere formation and destruction, and NOn chemistry. This paper describes an oil combustion model developed at Reaction Engineering International (RED. The oil combustion model, taking oil spray characterization measurements a inputs, focuses on the aerodynamics and combustion characteristics of oil droplets and NOx chemistry. High soot levels generated from oil flames have been considered for radiative heat transfer. Cenosphere formation and destruction are not modeled since the combustion field, heat release, and NOn chemistry are not significantly influenced by these phenomena. The code {{has been applied to}} a 600 MW oil-fired utility boiler and some of modeling results arc presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Objectives of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the effects of various drift retardant chemicals on <b>droplet</b> size, <b>spray</b> <b>pattern,</b> and <b>spray</b> drift reduction of sprays from an XR 8004 VH fan-pattern nozzle. Results indicated that, at recommended rates, Na 1 co-trol provided the largest increase in volume median diameters ofthe sprays followed by Direct, Target, Driftgard, and Formula 358. All drift retardants creatd patterns with greater volume toward the center than sprays of water only. Cumulative deposits beyond 0. 5 m downwind increased for all drift retardants when the wind velocity was increased from 2. 0 to 4. 0 m/s. The least amount of downwind deposit beyond 0. 5 m at 4. 0 m/s was with Na 1 co-trol followed by Target, Driftgard, Direct and formula 358...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The main {{function}} of a fuel injector nozzle is to break fuels into <b>droplets,</b> form the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern,</b> and propel the droplets into a combustion chamber. The amount of spray volume at a given operating pressure, the travel speed, and spacing between the jets of fuel can also {{be determined by the}} nozzle. In fuel injection, the smallest possible droplet size is desired for the most flow. This work presents an opportunity to use the Schlieren arrangement as a visualization method to view the flow of fuel from a three-hole fuel injector nozzle which cannot be seen by the naked eye. The jet flow of diesel Fuel was investigated by Schlieren photography. A test rig was designed and constructed to accommodate the nozzle; optical mirrors were arranged according to Schlieren specifications in order to allow the jet to be photographed. The breakaway pressure of the nozzle was varied between 60 bar to 80 bar. Each hole of the nozzle is 0. 26 mm in diameter and 120 ° apart; the third jet could not be seen from the images because the camera took x-y dimension images. The <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> observed from the two dimensional images of the jets developed were seen to be well dispersed. Su et al [3] found that emissions could be reduced in diesel engines if the injector nozzle produces smaller and more dispersed droplets...|$|R

The objective {{of the study was}} to estimate if the suppression of the formation of dioxins depends on the inlet gas temperature and diameter and/or temperature of <b>droplet</b> <b>spray</b> water using an actual incinerator operation data. The dioxin formation and/or the quenching temperature is revealed using the Altwicker theory equation with the information of inlet gas temperature and <b>droplet</b> <b>spray</b> water. The evaporation rate of a <b>spray</b> water <b>droplet</b> also can be estimated using the Mizutani theory. The highest dioxin formation was found at 350 degrees C; thereafter, it decreased quickly. When an area of 500 microm for droplet-formed dioxins is defined as 100 %, the values of formed dioxins for 400, 300, 200 and 100 microm droplet areas are estimated as 71, 41, 25 and 18 %, respectively. It is revealed that the smaller size of <b>droplet</b> <b>spray</b> water and lower inlet gas temperature enable the decrease in dioxin formation.

40|$|Foam {{spraying}} {{is often}} used as a safer alternative to <b>droplet</b> <b>spraying</b> {{in the context of}} biocides. However, there is a lack in methods and data for characterisation and assessment of potential aerosol exposure from foam spray applications, resulting in uncertainties in the authorisation of biocidal substances and products. First cursory experiments, carried out within the present study, show that aerosol release cannot generally be ruled out when using foams. The level of inhalation exposure is significantly reduced compared to conventional <b>droplet</b> <b>spraying.</b> However, the results give a first impression that the current use of <b>droplet</b> <b>spraying</b> data for exposure assessment might overestimate inhalation exposure of foam application.

50|$|As {{the name}} implies, the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> {{appears as a}} flat sheet of liquid. The pattern is formed by an {{elliptical}} or a round orifice on a deflective surface that is tangent to the exit orifice. The orifice has an external groove with a contoured internal cylindrical radius, or “cat’s eye” shape. In the elliptical orifice design, the <b>pattern</b> <b>sprays</b> out of the orifice {{in line with the}} pipe. In the deflector design, the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> is perpendicular to the pipe. There are two categories of flat spray, tapered and even, depending on the uniformity of the spray over the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern.</b> Flat <b>spray</b> <b>patterns</b> with tapering edges are produced by straight-through elliptical spray nozzles.

Single-enzyme kinetics has previously been demonstrated in the microfluidic format in PDMS containers [1], surface-immobilized droplets [2], or liposomes [3].

40|$|Abstract]: The {{design of}} modern petrol engines has placed an {{emphasis}} on lean combustion {{in order to increase}} efficiency, reduce operating noise and reduce pollutants. However, the closer the engine operates to the lean combustion limit the higher the possibility of engine misfires occurring. Misfires occur when there is not sufficient droplet density around the spark to allow the evaporation of the droplets and hence the release of fuel to the system. The advent of injection systems has enabled engineers to control the majority of the parameters of spray combustion, such as droplet size, <b>droplet</b> density and <b>spray</b> <b>pattern.</b> Therefore, the ability to model spray combustion would have wide ranging implications on the automotive industry. One model which lends itself to the modelling of spray combustion is the Conditional Moment Closure (CMC) model. However, the behaviour of the terms of the CMC model, namely the conditional scalar dissipation, conditional source term and the mixture fraction probability density function (pdf), is not understood well for this case. A number of Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) have been performed on different cases of combustion where fuel droplets are present in cold air and a spark is used to evaporate the droplets and initiate a flame kernel. Data was collected and models were developed for the three key terms of the CMC model. Validation of the first order CMC model was performed by attempting to recreate the behaviour of the DNS data. The performance of the first order CMC model was found to be poor due to the inability of the model to account for fluctuations about the conditional mean of the quantities. Another conditioning variable, or second-order conditional modelling, may be needed in order for the CMC model to adequately capture the behaviour of spark assisted, spray combustion...|$|R

40|$|Solidification in {{spray forming}} {{takes place in}} two {{distinct}} steps: typically half of the alloy latent heat is removed rapidly from the <b>droplet</b> <b>spray</b> created by gas atomization; the droplets are then constituted into a billet at deposition where the remaining liquid fraction solidifies relatively slowly. However, within the <b>droplet</b> <b>spray,</b> individual <b>droplets</b> have different thermal and solidification histories and depositing droplets may be solid, mushy, or liquid. Despite many studies of solidification behavior in spray forming, uncertainties and some misconceptions remain on how the solidification conditions in the spray and billet interact to give rise to the characteristic spray-formed microstructure comprising refined, polygonal/equiaxed primary grains {{with low levels of}} microsegregation. This article presents a simple numerical model for the spray-formed grain size arising from the deposition of the various <b>droplets</b> in the <b>spray</b> and combines insights provided by the model with previous investigations of the phenomena occurring during and immediately after deposition to propose a comprehensive description of the important solidification behavior during spray forming.

40|$|Foam {{spraying}} {{is often}} used {{as an alternative to}} <b>droplet</b> <b>spraying</b> for the treatment of surfaces. It is generally assumed that aerosol exposure is considerably smaller for foam sprays compared to conventional droplet mists. This especially refers to the application of biocides in the occupational section, e. g. the disinfection in the food industry {{as well as in the}} consumer section, especially for cosmetics and household cleaning agents ("convenience products"). While there is a well-developed quantitative understanding on the physical and technical parameters determining the exposure risk when using <b>droplet</b> <b>sprays,</b> the characterization of potential aerosol exposure for the application of foams has received little attention so far. In this study the current state of knowledge on the use of foam sprays for biocide application was surveyed from the literature. In addition some exploratory aerosol measurements were carried out for typical biocide products to compare aerosol release from foam and <b>droplet</b> <b>spraying.</b> More than 55 biocidal substances, such as QAV or peracidic products as well as pyrethrins and courmarins comprising products for disinfection, insecticides and rodenticides, are used in foams. The foaming technologies can be classified as mechanical foam generation using low and high pressure and blowing agent foam generation. Since no information on aerosol formation during foam spraying was found in the literature, exploratory aerosol measurements were performed in a laboratory set-up. A reduction of a factor of three was determined for aerosol release in the three health-related size fractions (respirable, thoracic, inhalable), when the biocidal product was sprayed as a foam compared to <b>droplet</b> <b>spraying.</b> Generation of semi-solid, highly-viscous foams using physical blowing agents lowered aerosol formation more than hundred fold. The experiments show that aerosol exposure cannot generally be ruled out when using foams but increasing foam viscosity seems to reduce aerosol release. Thus, further investigations should specify to what extent foam could be explained by physical chemical data of biocidal products by using specific application techniques. These factor determine not only the primary aerosol inhalation exposure but also the risk for exposure and mobility of the environment. Correlations allowing for a prediction of aerosol release from process and product parameters have to be established in future more comprehensive experiments...|$|R
