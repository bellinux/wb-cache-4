5|$|Although {{the motivations}} of those Australian's that volunteered {{to fight in}} Russia can only be guessed at, it seems {{unlikely}} to have been political. Regardless, they confirmed a reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign, despite their small numbers. Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home {{at the time and}} made little difference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the war. Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the {{government}} adopted a National Export Strategy to diversify the country’s exports. Production facilities {{are to be}} established {{for a wide range}} of products within the three selected clusters: oil seed products, sugar cane products and manufacturing. The government estimates that these three clusters have the potential to represent more than 50% of Malawi’s exports by 2027. In order to help companies adopt innovative practices and technologies, the strategy makes provision for greater access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of international research and better information about available technologies; it also helps companies to obtain grants to invest in such technologies from sources such as the country’s Export Development Fund and the Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{blurring}} and thresholding, {{this method}} can alternatively {{be described as}} applying a median filter with Gaussian weights to each pixel. It is possible to use kernels other than the heat kernel, or to adaptively refine the grid so that it has high resolution near the curve but does not waste time and memory on pixels far from the curve that do not contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome.</b> Instead of using only the two values in the pixelated image, {{a version of this}} method that uses an image whose pixel values represent the signed distance to the curve can achieve subpixel accuracy and require lower resolution.|$|E

40|$|Methods for {{evidence}} reviews and modelling Questions for the 2011 update of the Guidelines for the programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis (for Outcomes please see Table 2 {{in the main}} text of the Guidelines) 1. At what prevalence of MDR-TB in any group of TB patients is rapid drug-susceptibility testing warranted to detect resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid or rifampicin alone on all patients in the group {{at the time of}} TB diagnosis, in order to prescribe appropriate treatment at the outset?* 2. Among MDR-TB patients receiving appropriate treatment in settings with reliable direct microscopy, is monitoring using sputum smear microscopy alone rather than smear and culture, more or less likely <b>to</b> lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> listed in Table 2 of the guidelines?** 3. When designing regimens for patients with MDR-TB, is the inclusion of specific drugs (with or without documented susceptibility) more or less likely <b>to</b> lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> listed below?*** 4. When designing regimens for patients with MDR-TB, is the inclusion of fewer drugs in the regimen (depending on the drug used, the patient’s history of its use and isolate susceptibility) more or less likely <b>to</b> lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> listed in Table 2 of the guidelines?*** 5. In patients with MDR-TB, is shorter treatment, compared with the duration currently recommended by WHO, more or less likely <b>to</b> lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> listed in Table 2 of the guidelines?*** 6. In patients with HIV infection and drug-resistant TB receiving antiretroviral therapy, is the use of drugs with overlapping and potentially additive toxicities, compared with their avoidance, more or less likely <b>to</b> lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> listed in Table 2 of the guidelines?***...|$|R
5|$|During the game, players {{describe}} their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as {{picking up a}} letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice. Factors contributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> include the character's ability scores, skills {{and the difficulty of}} the task. In circumstances where a character does not have control of an event, such as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a saving throw can be used to determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided. In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores.|$|E
5|$|One {{early and}} {{influential}} theory of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It {{says that a}} successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view {{has been subjected to}} substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because {{it is a matter of}} chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> to be explained. Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The naval Battle of Jasmund (also {{known as}} the Battle of Rügen) took place between {{elements}} of the Danish and Prussian navies on 17 March 1864 during the Second Schleswig War. The action took place east of the Jasmund peninsula on the Prussian island of Rügen, during a Prussian attempt to weaken the Danish blockade in the Baltic Sea. The Prussian squadron, commanded by Eduard von Jachmann, sortied with two steam corvettes, a paddle steamer, and six gunboats to attack the Danish squadron blockading the eastern Prussian coast. The Danish force was commanded by Edvard van Dockum, and it consisted of one steam frigate, one ship of the line, and two steam corvettes. In an action lasting two hours, the superior Danish squadron forced the Prussians to withdraw, both sides suffering damage and light casualties. The Danish victory was compounded {{by the arrival of}} further warships after the battle, which cemented the blockade. The outcome of the battle, and the naval war in the Baltic as a whole, was irrelevant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the war, however, as the Prussian and Austrian armies decisively defeated the Danes on land, forcing them to surrender.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} hoplites is {{accepted}} as reasonable (and possible); the Athenians alone had fielded 10,000 hoplites at the Battle of Marathon. Some historians {{have accepted the}} number of light troops and used them as a population census of Greece at the time. Certainly these numbers are theoretically possible. Athens, for instance, allegedly fielded a fleet of 180 triremes at Salamis, manned by approximately 36,000 rowers and fighters. Thus 69,500 light troops {{could easily have been}} sent to Plataea. Nevertheless, the number of light troops is often rejected as exaggerated, especially in view of the ratio of seven helots to one Spartiate. For instance, Lazenby accepts that hoplites from other Greek cities might have been accompanied by one lightly armoured retainer each, but rejects the number of seven helots per Spartiate. He further speculates that each Spartiate was accompanied by one armed helot, and that the remaining helots were employed in the logistical effort, transporting food for the army. Both Lazenby and Holland deem the lightly armed troops, whatever their number, as essentially irrelevant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of battle.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary sources}} give little {{information}} as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the battle, barring Jordanes. All emphasize the casualty {{count of the}} battle, and the battle became increasingly seen as a Gothic victory, beginning with Cassiodorus in the early 6th century.|$|E
