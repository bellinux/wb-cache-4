40|$|A {{much higher}} old-age {{dependency}} ratio, together with more generous pension benefits, {{will lead to}} a substantial increase in the future public pension expenditures burden in Norway. A pension reform implemented from 2010 will imply a shift to a quasi-actuarial system, seeking <b>to</b> <b>neutralise</b> the <b>expenditure</b> effect of further growth in life expectancy and strengthen ties between former earnings and pension benefits. Labour supply will be stimulated by lowering implicit tax rates and by aligning the social and private costs of early retirement.
