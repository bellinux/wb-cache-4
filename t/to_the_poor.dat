5|$|A {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} electron affinity going down groups would be expected. The additional electron will be entering an orbital {{farther away from}} the nucleus. As such this electron would be less attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added. However, in going down a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, this is due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> shielding by d and f electrons. A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.|$|E
5|$|Across its path, Bingiza {{destroyed}} 25,464houses {{and damaged}} 36schools. Overall, {{the damage was}} less than expected, given {{the strength of the}} cyclone. Most of the damage occurred due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> infrastructure and drainage systems of Madagascar, along with high levels of poverty. A total of 34deaths were reported, along with 13injuries. When Bingiza made its final landfall, it produced five days of rainfall to a region already severely affected by flooding. In Vangaindrano district in southeastern Madagascar, the cyclone caused widespread flooding that isolated five villages, as well as covering fields of rice and other crops. A total of 310people in the southern portion of the country were left homeless.|$|E

The findings illustrate how increased participation as a result of massive investments in Education for All programs have yet to provide as much benefit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> as <b>the</b> middle <b>poor.</b> It also lead to confirmations that relate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> role of the state as [...] "the provider of last resort" [...] <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest,</b> which provides a counterpoint <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arguments of those who believe that {{the role of the state}} in providing public goods like basic education <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> can and should be reduced.

Real attendance estimates range from 40,000-50,000, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> weather {{and the fact that}} the stadium was half-empty through much of the game.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{supported}} Guy's claim, but Ubaldo, Archbishop of Pisa, Philip of Dreux, Bishop of Beauvais, and Eraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, supported Conrad.

He wrote his will shortly before his death, and died surrounded by his followers on the crusade. Hubert Walter assumed {{the leadership of the}} English forces, and also became Baldwin's executor.

5|$|Despite initial {{concerns}} that the Queen might be barren, Henry and Eleanor had five children together. In 1239 Eleanor gave birth to their first child, Edward, named after the Confessor. Henry was overjoyed and held huge celebrations, giving lavishly to the Church and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> to encourage God to protect his young son. Their first daughter, Margaret, named after Eleanor's sister, followed in 1240, her birth also accompanied by celebrations and donations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor.</b> Henry's third child, Beatrice, was named after his mother-in-law, and born in 1242 during a campaign in Poitou. Their fourth child, Edmund, arrived in 1245 and was named after the 9th-century saint: concerned about Eleanor's health, Henry donated {{large amounts of money}} to the Church throughout the pregnancy. A third daughter, Katherine, was born in 1253 but soon fell ill, possibly the result of a degenerative disorder such as Rett syndrome, and was unable to speak. She died in 1257 and Henry was distraught. Henry's children spent most of their childhood at Windsor Castle and he appears to have been extremely attached to them, rarely spending extended periods of time apart from his family.|$|E
5|$|During her lifetime, Sarah drafted twenty-six wills, {{the last}} of which was only written {{a few months before}} her death; and had {{purchased}} twenty-seven estates. With a wealth of over £4 million in land; £17,000 in rent rolls; and a further £12,500 in annuities, she made financial bequests to rising Whig ministers such as William Pitt, later the first Earl of Chatham, and Philip Stanhope, the fourth Earl of Chesterfield. Although she left little <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> and even less to charity, she left her servants annuities far above the average for the time: her favourite, Grace Ridley, received £16,000, equivalent to approximately £1.32million in today's money.|$|E
