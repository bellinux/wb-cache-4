2500|$|The copies contain {{inscriptions}} {{from various}} periods, and the oldest, dated 27May 1617, {{is found in}} the seventh copy: [...] "Let it be known when Josif lost his psalter." [...] In 1870, historian and bibliophile Gavrilo Vitković sold this copy to the Serbian Learned Society. In {{the second half of the}} 18th century, the second copy belonged to the priest Stefan Kostić from Krtole in the Bay of Kotor. It came to Russia in 1847, when Vuk Karadžić sent it to Mikhail Pogodin in Moscow. The third copy was part of Šafárik's large library of manuscripts and old printed books. The fifth copy belonged to Vuk Karadžić, and later to Mikhail F. Rayevsky, who gave it to the Kiev Theological Academy in 1881. The eighth and the ninth copies were destroyed along with the National Library of Serbia by the German bombing of Belgrade in April 1941. The tenth copy belonged to the Serbian Orthodox Monastery of Marča in Croatia in the 18th century. At the beginning of the 20th century, Radoslav M. Grujić found it in a parish home in the village of Veliki Pašijan. The <b>thirteenth</b> <b>copy</b> was part of the collection of bibliophile Georgije Mihajlović from the town of Inđija, who gave it to the Library of Matica Srpska in 1962. The sixteenth copy once belonged to a Serbian Orthodox monastery in the village of Gaćište, Croatia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reforms of}} Cluny and later of Clairvaux were not {{favourable}} to studies. The chief {{aim of the}} reformers was to combat the secular spirit and re-establish strict religious observances. This influence is {{in harmony with the}} tendencies of scholasticism. Consequently, from the twelfth century and especially the <b>thirteenth,</b> the <b>copying</b> of manuscripts became a secular business, a source of gain. The following is a list of the most ancient or most useful manuscripts of the Latin classics for the Middle Ages: ...|$|R
5000|$|The Bibliotheca Rosenthaliana holds a late <b>thirteenth</b> century <b>copy</b> of Rabbi Isaac ben Moses of Vienna's famous work, Sefer Or Zarua. It was his magnum opus, {{and he is}} {{therefore}} {{often referred to as}} Isaac Or Zarua. Despite its nature as a halakhic work, Sefer Or Zarua provides plenty of historical information in the form of everyday traditions and local customs across Europe that makes it an interesting source for both religious and medieval historians. This manuscript is one of only two extant medieval copies, the other being held at the British Library in London, and the basis for the first published edition of the work, published in 1862 in Zhytomyr. The Sefer Or Zarua preserves one of the earliest versions of the story of Rabbi Amnon of Mainz.|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} divided into three sections. The first section {{discusses}} the manuscript Marcianus graecus 524, the second looks at the Greek text of the dedicatory epigrams on works of art from the same manuscript, and the third puts these texts in their context. In the first part, the compilation of the manuscript is analysed. I suggest that the manuscript was copied mainly by one individual scribe living in Constantinople {{at the end of the}} <b>thirteenth</b> century. He <b>copied</b> the quires individually, but at some point he put all these quires together, added new quires, and compiled an anthology of poetry. The scribe’s connection to the Planudean School and the Petra monastery in Constantinople is discussed. Although their relationship remains inconclusive, the manuscript provides evidence regarding the literary interests of late-thirteenth-century intellectuals. The second part contains thirty-five unpublished dedicatory epigrams on works of art. New readings are offered for the text of previously published epigrams. The third section analyses the dedicatory epigrams on works of art in their context. The first chapter of this section discusses the epigrams as Gebrauchstexte, i. e. texts with a practical use. The difference between epigrams intended to be inscribed and epigrams intended to be performed is highlighted. In the next chapter of this part, La poésie de l’objet, the composition of the dedicatory epigrams is discussed. The conventional character of the epigrams suggests that the poetics express the ritual aspect of the epigram. The last chapter considers the texts from a more pragmatic angle. After a short discussion of the objects on which the epigrams were written, the mechanisms of the twelfth-century art market are presented based on evidence taken mainly from the epigrams. At the end of this part, conclusions are drawn on the understanding of these texts in the twelfth century. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
