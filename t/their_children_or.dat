5|$|When {{high school}} {{students}} followed the lead of their elders and demonstrated, Diệm had them arrested as well. Two of the detained students were paraded {{at a press conference}} in which they falsely admitted to being communists who had brainwashed their entire school, having been tortured to force their confession. At Trung Vuong, an elite girls' high school, the students hung up banners attacking Diệm and the Nhus, while students from the corresponding boys' schools became violent, smashing school windows and erecting banners that insulted Madame Nhu in explicit language. More than 1000 students from Saigon's leading high school, most of them children of public servants and military officers, were sent to re-education camps. The result was that many army officers and senior civil servants had to lobby to have <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>or</b> younger siblings released from jail, causing a further drop in morale among government and military officials. In more extreme cases, brawls broke out between police officers arresting students, and the students' parents, many of whom were military officers and/or public servants.|$|E
5|$|After some time, the king's {{designated}} successor, Andriambonimena, {{launched a}} retaliatory {{attack against the}} prince's half-brother Andrianentoarivo at Ambohipotsy and successfully chased him from his fief. Andriantomponimerina {{recognized the need to}} take more dramatic action to consolidate his grip on power and sent a messenger to the Sakalava king requesting his support. The Sakalava reaffirmed their loyalty to Andriamasinavalona, however, and threatened to attack the prince if the rightful king was not released from his captivity. According to one version of the oral history, having failed to use the king as a pawn to gain power, the prince decided to ransom his father for 7,000 piastres to increase his personal wealth. Every citizen of Imerina was obligated to contribute, and those who had no money sold <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>or</b> themselves into slavery in order to raise the necessary funds. The money was placed in seven baskets and transported by dugout canoe to the prince at Ambohidratrimo, who released the king. According to another version of the story, Prince Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana of Ambohimanga sent two hunters of the Tsimahafotsy clan to free the king by digging an escape passage under the wall of his heavily guarded enclosure. After returning to Antananarivo, Andriamasinavalona sent a messenger who announced that the king had decided to hand power to Andriantomponimerina and invited the prince to the capital to be enthroned. The prince hurried to the palace, and throughout the city he was greeted with cheers, singing and dancing. When Andriamasinavalona received him, however, he publicly condemned the prince and stripped him of his rank and power.|$|E

25|$|Infants whose {{mothers are}} more {{sensitive}} {{are more likely to}} display secure attachment relationships.

Those infants whose mothers do not respond to the signals from <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>or</b> respond inappropriately to their children's cries for attention will form insecure and anxious attachments because the infants are unable to consistently depend on the maternal figures for predictable and safe responses.|$|E
25|$|At {{the height}} of his success, Worth {{reformed}} the highly popular trend, the crinoline.

Worth wanted to design a more practical silhouette for women, so he made the crinoline more narrow and gravitated the largest part to the back, freeing up a woman’s front and sides. Worth’s new crinoline was a major success. Eventually, Worth abandoned the crinoline altogether, creating a straight gown shape without a defined waist that became known as the princess line.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the power}} {{relationships}} at work, slave women in the United States were {{at high risk for}} rape and sexual abuse. Many slaves fought back against sexual attacks, and some died resisting. Others carried psychological and physical scars from the attacks. Sexual abuse of slaves was partially rooted in a patriarchal Southern culture which treated black women as property or chattel. Southern culture strongly policed against sexual relations between white women and black men on the purported grounds of racial purity but, by the late 18th century, the many mixed-race slaves and slave children showed that white men had often taken advantage of slave women. Wealthy planter widowers, notably such as John Wayles and his son-in-law Thomas Jefferson, took slave women as concubines; each had six children with his partner: Elizabeth Hemings and her daughter Sally Hemings (the half-sister of Jefferson's late wife), respectively. Both Mary Chesnut and Fanny Kemble, wives of planters, wrote about this issue in the antebellum South in the decades before the Civil War. Sometimes planters used mixed-race slaves as house servants or favored artisans because they were <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>or</b> other relatives. As a result of centuries of slavery and such relationships, DNA {{studies have shown that the}} vast majority of African Americans also have historic European ancestry, generally through paternal lines.|$|E

500|$|As {{they were}} {{traveling}} with the theater, Simonovich-Efimova's interest in painting rekindled. She was inspired to depict women in their regional dress digging potatoes, comforting <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> <b>or</b> attending fairs and festivals. She painted pictures of women and girls in 1924 and again in 1926 while in Lipetsk; colorful images with reds, greens and ambers in a noted series called [...] "Tambov women"; picturesque scenes from Bashkiria and Udmurtia; and a critically acclaimed series created in Crimea and Novgorod. The Novgorod paintings began in a period when the Effimovs had fled Moscow in 1935 because of political turmoil. During this time, purges of 1933 and the party restructuring that followed in 1935, bureaucrats, corrupt officials, shirkers and those who sought personal gain over state benefit were targeted, rather than previous purges which had focused upon bourgeoisie elements. Even if one were not a target of the purge, {{a broad range of}} society was effected, because the purges were aimed at eliminating all those affiliated with a targeted party member. Fear of arrest, denunciation, or extortion, created uncertainty for every strata of society. The paintings from the period comprise mostly landscapes of the area surrounding the city and ancient buildings, where Simonovich-Efimova walked to enjoy the peace of her surroundings.|$|E

Jared Lee Loughner, the perpetrator of the 2011 Tucson shooting, followed 2012-related predictions.
