60|$|Hope and {{the future}} for me are not in lawns and {{cultivated}} fields, not in towns and cities, but in the impervious and quaking swamps. When, formerly, I have analyzed my partiality for some farm which I had contemplated purchasing, I have frequently found that I was attracted solely by a few square rods of impermeable and unfathomable bog,--a natural sink {{in one corner of}} it. That was the jewel which dazzled me. I derive more of my subsistence from the swamps which surround my native town than from the cultivated gardens in the village. There are no richer parterres to my eyes than the dense beds of dwarf andromeda (Cassandra calyculata) which cover these tender places on the earth's surface. Botany cannot go farther than tell me the names of the shrubs which grow there,--the high-blueberry, panicled andromeda, lamb-kill, azalea, and rhodora,--all standing in the quaking sphagnum. I often think that I should like to have my house front on this mass of dull red bushes, omitting other flower plots and borders, transplanted spruce and <b>trim</b> <b>box,</b> even gravelled walks,--to have this fertile spot under my windows, not a few imported barrow-fulls of soil only to cover the sand which was thrown out in digging the cellar. Why not put my house, my parlor, behind this plot, instead of behind that meagre assemblage of curiosities, that poor apology for a Nature and Art, which I call my front-yard? It is an effort to clear up and make a decent appearance when the carpenter and mason have departed, though done as much for the passer-by as the dweller within. The most tasteful front-yard fence was never an agreeable object of study to me; the most elaborate ornaments, acorn-tops, or what not, soon wearied and disgusted me. Bring your sills up to {{the very edge of the}} swamp, then, (though it may not be the best place for a dry cellar,) so that there be no access on that side to citizens. Front-yards are not made to walk in, but, at most, through, and you could go in the back way.|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid change}} to ¼-inch trim by the packing {{industry}} has been brought about by producers using their checkoff dollars to show retail meat buyers the way to value the closer trim product. The computer system, CARDS, developed by Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M {{in cooperation with the}} National Livestock and Meat Board has allowed retailers to evaluate the closer trim product and use it in their buying programs. This demand by the retail industry has driven packers to offer the product. Today, all three major packers offer a closely <b>trimmed</b> <b>boxed</b> beef product. The growth in acceptance of this product has surprised many watchers in the cattle industry. We are an industry noted for changing slowly over long periods of time. The change to closely trimmed product has happened in months and continues to pick up speed. This rapid change will present a challenge for cattle feeders and cow-calf producers to respond to the new realities of the marketplace...|$|R

The strips are then woven together in various designs, each with a symbolic meaning, and the ends are <b>trimmed.</b> Each <b>box</b> is covered with silk or satin, and finally, a double layer of paper is used to line the base. Chaesang are usually created in nested groups of three, although five or even seven nested boxes are not unheard of. It can take two weeks, or even {{as long as a}} month to produce a set.|$|R

It had a very high wall around it, all of metal, and an archway, and a {{straight}} walk into it, just like what 'ud be leading into a gentleman's orchard, but the edges were not <b>trimmed</b> with <b>box,</b> but with red-hot metal. And inside the wall there were cross-walks, and I'm not sure what there was to the right, but to the left there were five great furnaces, and they full of souls kept there with great chains. So I turned short and went away, and in turning I {{looked again at the}} wall, and I could see no end to it.|$|R
40|$|The National Beef Quality Audit, {{conducted}} by Colorado State, Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M and Texas Tech Universities in 1992, was a 2 ̆ 2 wake-up 2 ̆ 2 {{call to the}} beef cattle industry. The {{results of the audit}} of the slaughter cattle population, conducted in 28 plants from across the U. S., indicated a total of some 280 in inefficiencies for each fed steer and heifer produced in the beef business. Furthermore, when these inefficiencies were categorized, it became apparent that the majority of these losses occur due to excess fat production with lower consistency in taste than desired. If the industry is to remain a viable sector of the food business, it cannot ignore the challenge presented by these results: the beef cattle industry needs to achieve change at the carcass level, by implementing a combination of changes in feeding and management practices coupled with genetic improvement. If one reviews the history of the 2 ̆ 2 carcass merit/value-based marketing 2 ̆ 2 issue, the argument has repeatedly been raised by both industry and academia that goes something like this: 2 ̆ 2 I do not get paid on the basis of carcass performance, and until I do, I see little justification for collecting carcass data. Furthermore, 2 ̆ 2 value-based marketing 2 ̆ 2 is a buzz word made up by the packing industry, {{for the benefit of the}} packing industry, that seems to keep getting delayed in its implementation. 2 ̆ 2 While this argument may appear to be historically true, it also is somewhat short-sighted. The fact of the matter is that the business of selling beef has become more challenging due to competition from the poultry and pork industries. The response of the beef packing and retail industries is beginning to be seen through the development of new closely <b>trimmed</b> <b>boxed</b> beef. In the past two years, Excel, IBP and Monfort-ConAgra have all developed 1 / 4 inch trim (or less) boxed-beef specifications. Industry consensus is that approximately 40...|$|R

The roughness of the rocky plane along the winding path which goes up to the villa has not stopped the construction of terraces and flower beds with yews and <b>boxes</b> <b>trimmed</b> geometrically.

The automotive glove <b>box</b> <b>trim</b> cover was chosen as analytical model. This study {{has been focused on}} the influence on fill time, warpage, sink mark depth and clamp force of different materials. PP+T 15, PP+T 20, PP+T 25, PP+T 30, PP+T 35, PP+T 40 and ABS+PC were used for analysis in this study. The injection molding processes of automotive interior trim of different materials were analyzed by using Moldflow software, the rationality of the material choice was evaluated. Merits and drawbacks of different materials were found out through the analysis done in Moldflow. There is positive influence on reducing mold cycle and negative influence on advancing the dimension stability of part by using the kind of PP materials. Oppositely, there is negative influence on reducing mold cycle and positive influence on advancing the dimension stability of part by using ABS. It can be reduce extremely the cost for manufacturing the mold, and shorten the development cycle by using this method...|$|R
60|$|The modest abode {{to which}} I have alluded forms {{one of a}} {{circular}} range of pretty, moderate-sized, two-story houses, all built on nearly the same plan, and each provided with its little grass-plot, its flowers, its tufts of <b>box</b> <b>trimmed</b> into globes and other fantastic shapes, and its verdant hedges shutting the house in from the common drive and dividing it from its equally cosey neighbors. Coming out of the door, and taking a turn round the circle of sister-dwellings, {{it is difficult to}} find your way back by any distinguishing individuality of your own habitation. In the centre of the Circus is a space fenced in with iron railing, a small play-place and sylvan retreat for the children of the precinct, permeated by brief paths through the fresh English grass, and shadowed by various shrubbery; amid which, if you like, you may fancy yourself in a deep seclusion, though probably the mark of eye-shot from the windows of all the surrounding houses. But, in truth, with regard {{to the rest of the}} town and the world at large, all abode here is a genuine seclusion; for the ordinary stream of life does not run through this little, quiet pool, and few or none of the inhabitants seem to be troubled with any business or outside activities. I used to set them down as half-pay officers, dowagers of narrow income, elderly maiden ladies, and other people of respectability, but small account, such as hang on the world's skirts rather than actually belong to it. The quiet of the place was seldom disturbed, except by the grocer and butcher, who came to receive orders, or by the cabs, hackney-coaches, and Bath-chairs, in which the ladies took an infrequent airing, or the livery-steed which the retired captain sometimes bestrode for a morning ride, or by the red-coated postman who went his rounds twice a day to deliver letters, and again in the evening, ringing a hand-bell, to take letters for the mail. In merely mentioning these slight interruptions of its sluggish stillness, I seem to myself to disturb too much the atmosphere of quiet that brooded over the spot; whereas its impression upon me was, that the world had never found the way hither, or had forgotten it, and that the fortunate inhabitants were the only ones who possessed the spell-word of admittance. Nothing could have suited me better, at the time; for I had been holding a position of public servitude, which imposed upon me (among a great many lighter duties) the ponderous necessity of being universally civil and sociable.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{comprehensive}} review of Japan’s agricultural domestic policy since 1995 in the context of the current international negotiations in the WTO Doha Round, which has as one aim further reductions of trade-distorting support among member countries. An overwhelming majority of farmers in Japan own small plots of rice paddy fields and earn their living mainly on their off-farm income. They go out into rice paddy fields in their spare time as a subsidiary business. Traditional small farming communities are powerful voting groups that seek to maintain their political power. By exerting political pressures on the authorities, farmers can obtain large returns through the manipulation of farmland use regulations, even though such manipulation causes social harm by preventing efficient land use. These inefficiencies in land use are a major reason why Japan is the only country whose food self-sufficiency rate keeps declining in spite of its heavy agricultural protection. In this sense, Japan is in sharp contrast to European and North American countries, where heavy agricultural domestic supports have resulted in an increased output of agricultural commodities and subsequent distortions in international markets. Apparently, Japan’s attitude towards agricultural domestic policy reform is one of compliance with the WTO, which requests member countries to reduce their Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS) through <b>trimming</b> trade-distorting (amber <b>box)</b> support and/or transforming traditional-type agricultural subsidies to decoupled-type ones. Japan reduced its amber box support by nearly 80 percent between 1995 and 2000. This drastic reduction is mainly attributable to Japan’s removal of rice from the amber box in 1998. In addition, following the WTO’s principle of decoupling, Japan launched an extensive agricultural subsidy reform in 2007. This paper, however, shows the ironical realities of Japanese agricultural policy. Neither a sharp reduction of amber box support nor Japan’s 2007 reform necessarily mean there will be a reduction of trade-distorting effects. On the contrary, the 2007 reform may in fact stimulate domestic rice production. In 2007, Japan’s AMS is as little as 18 percent of its commitment level from the Uruguay Round WTO agreements. In addition, this paper projects that Japan’s overall trade-distorting support (OTDS) for 2013 will be 469 billion yen, which is much less than the limit of 1, 635 billion yen that is proposed in the modalities under discussion in July 2008 for the WTO Doha Round. Thus, the WTO Doha Round negotiations on domestic support policy are unlikely to restrict Japan’s domestic agricultural support policy.
