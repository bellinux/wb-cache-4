5|$|Intraoperative {{radiation}} therapy (IORT) delivers radiation {{at the same}} time as the surgery to remove the tumour (lumpectomy). An applicator is placed in the cavity left after tumour removal and a mobile electronic device generates radiation (either x-rays or electrons) and delivers it via the applicator. Radiation is delivered all at once and the applicator removed before closing <b>the</b> <b>incision.</b>|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is <b>the</b> <b>incision</b> of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
5|$|A general {{principle}} concerning dental abscesses is ubi pus, ibi evacua ("{{where there is}} pus, drain it"), which applies to any case {{where there is a}} collection of pus in the tissues (such as a periodontal abscess, pericoronal abscess, or apical abscess). The pus within the abscess is under pressure, and the surrounding tissues are deformed and stretched to accommodate the swelling. This leads to a sensation of throbbing (often in time with the pulse) and constant pain. Pus may be evacuated via the tooth by drilling into the pulp chamber (an endodontic access cavity). Such a treatment is sometimes termed open drainage. Drainage can also be performed via the tooth socket, once the causative tooth is extracted. If neither of those measures succeeds, or they are impossible, incision and drainage may be required, in which a small incision is made in the soft tissues directly over the abscess at the most dependent point. A surgical instrument such as a pair of tweezers is gently inserted into <b>the</b> <b>incision</b> and opened, while the abscess is massaged to encourage the pus to drain out. Usually, the reduction in pain when the pus drains is immediate and marked as the built up pressure is relieved. If the pus drains into the mouth, there is usually a bad or offensive taste.|$|E

5|$|The Sermons of Swift {{have none}} of that thunder which appals, or that resistless and winning {{softness}} which melts, the hearts of an audience. He can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command their respect, but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, imputable more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vice of rich or poor; and, disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices in a tone of stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies <b>the</b> <b>incision</b> knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is a principle of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the feelings of the preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E
25|$|Transincision (or transwound) {{catheter}} anesthesia uses a multilumen catheter inserted {{through an}} insicion or wound and aligned across {{it on the}} inside as <b>the</b> <b>incision</b> or wound is closed, providing continuous administration of local anesthetic along <b>the</b> <b>incision</b> or wound.|$|E
25|$|Small {{amounts of}} food is usually {{introduced}} {{as soon as}} possible after surgery, usually within 18–36 hours, to encourage motility and reduce the risk of ileus and the formation of adhesions. Often horses are stall rested with short bouts of hand walking to encourage intestinal motility. <b>The</b> <b>incision</b> site is carefully monitored for dehiscence, or complete failure of <b>the</b> <b>incision</b> leading to spillage of the abdominal contents out of <b>the</b> <b>incision</b> site, and the horse is not allowed turn-out until <b>the</b> <b>incision</b> has healed, usually after 30 days of stall rest. Abdominal bandages are sometimes used to help prevent the risk of dehiscence. Incisional infection doubles the time required for postoperative care, and dehiscence may lead to intestinal herniation, which reduces the likelihood of return to athletic function. Therefore, antibiotics are given 2–3 days after surgery, and temperature is constantly monitored, to help assess if an infection is present. Antibiotics are not used long-term due to the risk of antimicrobial resistance. <b>The</b> <b>incision</b> usually takes 6 months to reach 80% strength, while intestinal healing following resection and anastomosis is much faster, at a rate to 100% strength in 3 weeks. After <b>the</b> <b>incision</b> has healed adequately, the horse is turned out in a small area for another 2–3 months, and light exercise is added to improve the tone and strength of the abdominal musculature.|$|E

50|$|LRI {{have become}} the most common {{technique}} to correct astigmatism as part of cataract surgery. They are simpler and less expensive than laser surgery such as LASIK or photorefractive keratectomy. Good results do not require the location and length of <b>the</b> <b>incisions</b> to be highly precise. And <b>the</b> <b>incisions</b> can easily be extended later if the original procedure did not correct all of the astigmatism.|$|R

50|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>incisions</b> are small, and {{the amount}} of fluid that must drain out is large, some {{surgeons}} opt to leave <b>the</b> <b>incisions</b> open, <b>the</b> better to clear the patient's body of excess fluid. They find that the unimpeded departure of that fluid allows <b>the</b> <b>incisions</b> to heal more quickly. Others suture them only partially, leaving space for the fluid to drain out. Others delay suturing until most of the fluid has drained out, about 1 or 2 days. In any case, while the fluid is draining, dressings need to be changed often. After one to three days, small self-adhesive bandages are sufficient. Doctors disagree on the issues of scarring with not suturing versus resolution of the swelling allowed by leaving the wounds open to drain fluid.|$|R

25|$|Traditional open {{surgery is}} usually {{performed}} through a ventral midline incision below the umbilicus. <b>The</b> <b>incision</b> size varies {{depending upon the}} surgeon {{and the size of}} the animal.

25|$|The {{surgery is}} {{performed}} under general anesthesia and takes about an hour. The surgeon makes an incision of approximately seven centimetres, prepares the customised {{space in the}} chest, inserts the implant deep beneath the muscle, then closes <b>the</b> <b>incision.</b> Post-operative hospitalization is typically around three days.|$|E

25|$|Psychic surgery, a pseudoscience constituting medical fraud, {{is when a}} {{practitioner}} creates the illusion of performing surgery {{with his or her}} bare hands and uses trickery, fake blood, and animal parts to convince the patient that the diseased lesions were removed and that <b>the</b> <b>incision</b> spontaneously healed.|$|E
25|$|The double {{incision}} {{surgery and}} {{minimally invasive surgery}} seeks to reduce soft tissue damage through reducing the size of <b>the</b> <b>incision.</b> However, component positioning accuracy and visualization of the bone structures is significantly impaired. This can result in unintended fractures and soft tissue injury. Surgeons using these approaches are advised to use intraoperative x-ray fluoroscopy or computer guidance systems.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} types of {{caesarean}} section (CS). An important distinction lies {{in the type of}} incision (longitudinal or transverse) made on the uterus, apart from <b>the</b> <b>incision</b> on the skin: the vast majority of skin incisions are a transverse suprapubic approach known as a Pfannenstiel incision but {{there is no way of}} knowing from the skin scar which way the uterine incision was conducted.|$|E
25|$|Coronectomy is a {{procedure}} used when the surgeon {{believes that there}} is a high risk of inferior alveolar nerve injury. After making <b>the</b> <b>incision</b> in the mucosa and removing bone adjacent the tooth, the crown is cut and removed with no attempt at removing the roots. It is indicated when there is no disease of the dental pulp or infection around the crown of the tooth and there is a high risk of inferior alveolar nerve injury.|$|E
25|$|Historically the European {{medicinal}} leech, another invertebrate parasite, {{has been}} used in medicine to remove blood from patients. They have three jaws (tripartite) that look like little saws, and on them are about 100 sharp teeth used to incise the host. <b>The</b> <b>incision</b> leaves a mark that is an inverted Y inside of a circle. After piercing the skin and injecting anticoagulants (hirudin) and anaesthetics, they suck out blood, consuming up to ten times their body weight in a single meal.|$|E
50|$|Normally, {{copper or zinc}} {{plates are}} used as a surface or matrix, and <b>the</b> <b>incisions</b> are created by etching, engraving, drypoint, {{aquatint}} or mezzotint. Collagraphs may also be printed as intaglio plates.|$|R
5000|$|Limbal Relaxing Incisions (LRI) are a {{refractive}} {{surgical procedure}} to correct minor astigmatism in <b>the</b> eye. <b>Incisions</b> are {{made at the}} opposite edges of the cornea, following {{the curve of the}} iris, causing a slight flattening in that direction. Because <b>the</b> <b>incisions</b> are outside of the field of view, they do not cause glare and other visual effects that result from other corneal surgeries like Radial Keratotomy.|$|R
50|$|Intaglio is a {{printing}} technique {{in which the}} image is incised into a surface. Normally, copper or zinc plates are used, and <b>the</b> <b>incisions</b> are created by etching or engraving the image, but one may also use mezzotint. In printing, the surface is covered in ink, and then rubbed vigorously with tarlatan cloth or newspaper to remove the ink from the surface, leaving it in <b>the</b> <b>incisions.</b> A damp piece of paper is placed on top, and the plate and paper are run through {{a printing}} press that, through pressure, transfers the ink to the paper.|$|R
