5|$|Actual {{proof of}} <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way {{consisting}} of many stars came in 1610 when the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way {{and discovered that}} it is composed of {{a huge number of}} faint stars.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, the Sun's December {{solstice}} position (in {{the northern}} hemisphere, {{the lowest point}} on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of Sagittarius, one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way. Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way, appear (from {{the surface of the}} Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way. Given that <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it. In 2012 it was about halfway through <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way, crossing the galactic equator. In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Milky</b> Way {{galaxy and}} the nearby Andromeda Galaxy are moving toward each other at about 130km/s, and—depending upon the lateral movements—the two might collide in about five to six billion years. Although <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way has never {{collided}} with a galaxy as large as Andromeda before, evidence of past collisions of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way with smaller dwarf galaxies is increasing.|$|E

500|$|The {{specific}} epithet [...] "volemus" [...] {{is derived}} from the Latin vola, meaning [...] "the hollow of the hand", suggestive of Fries's reference to the large amount of latex [...] "flowing enough to fill the hand". Common names for L.volemus include the weeping milk cap, the tawny milkcap, <b>the</b> orange-brown <b>milky,</b> <b>the</b> voluminous-latex <b>milky,</b> <b>the</b> lactarius orange, the fishy milkcap, and the apricot milk cap. In the West Virginian mountains of the United States, the mushroom is called a [...] "leatherback" [...] or a [...] "bradley". The latter name may originate from its German name Brätling.|$|R

5|$|The rate of star {{formation}} in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way is much higher, with Andromeda Galaxy producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 3–5 solar masses for <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way. The rate of supernovae in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way is also double that of Andromeda Galaxy. This suggests that the latter once experienced a great {{star formation}} phase, but {{is now in a}} relative state of quiescence, whereas <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way is experiencing more active star formation. Should this continue, the luminosity in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way may eventually overtake that of Andromeda Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy may be {{the same}} size as <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way but has a visible star count of only 1% of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way. The lack of {{luminosity}} is because {{there is a lack of}} star-forming gas in the galaxy which results in old stellar populations.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 {{a debate}} {{took place between}} Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis (the Great Debate), {{concerning}} the nature of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way, spiral nebulae, and {{the dimensions of the}} Universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula is an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way, as well as the significant Doppler shift.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, an overdensity {{of stars}} in the region was {{announced}} to be the Canis Major Dwarf, the closest satellite galaxy to Earth. However, there remains debate over whether it represents a disrupted dwarf galaxy or in fact {{a variation in the}} thin and thick disk and spiral arm populations of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way. Investigation of the area yielded only ten RR Lyrae variables—consistent with <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way's halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy. On the other hand, a globular cluster in Puppis, NGC 2298—which appears {{to be part of the}} Canis Major dwarf system—is extremely metal-poor, suggesting it did not arise from <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way's thick disk, and instead is of extragalactic origin.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to detecting extrasolar planets, SIM {{would have helped}} astronomers construct a map of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way galaxy. Other important tasks would have included collecting data to help pinpoint stellar masses for specific types of stars, assisting in {{the determination of the}} spatial distribution of dark matter in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way and in the local group of galaxies and using the gravitational microlensing effect to measure the mass of stars.|$|E
5|$|On December 1, 2011, it was {{announced}} that Voyager 1 had detected the first Lyman-alpha radiation originating from <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way galaxy.

5|$|Our {{solar system}} orbits within <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way, a {{barred spiral galaxy}} that is a {{prominent}} member of the Local Group of galaxies. It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way that are obscured from view.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{researchers}} described galaxies called super-luminous spirals. They {{are very}} large with an upward diameter of 437,000 light-years (compared to <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way's 100,000 light-year diameter). With {{a mass of}} 340 billion solar masses, they generate {{a significant amount of}} ultraviolet and mid-infrared light. They are thought to have an increased star formation rate around 30 times faster than <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Milky</b> Way has a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond in order for <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows {{a great deal of}} detail at +6.1. This makes <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon. The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way from their homes due to light pollution.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Milky</b> Way is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} with a {{diameter}} between 100,000 and 180,000 light-years. <b>The</b> <b>Milky</b> Way is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars. There are probably at least 100 billion planets in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way. The Solar System is located within the disk, about 26,000 light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge {{of one of the}} spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust called the Orion Arm. The stars in the inner ≈10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The very center is marked by an intense radio source, named Sagittarius A*, which {{is likely to be a}} supermassive black hole.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Milky</b> Way {{runs through}} the constellation, {{featuring}} prominent objects such as the open cluster NGC 5823 and the planetary nebula NGC 5315. Circinus hosts a spiral galaxy, the Circinus Galaxy, which was discovered in 1977 and is the closest Seyfert galaxy to <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way. The Alpha Circinids (ACI), a meteor shower also discovered in 1977, radiate from this constellation.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System {{is located}} in <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way, a barred spiral galaxy with a {{diameter}} of about 100,000 light-years containing about 100 billion stars. The Sun resides in one of <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way's outer spiral arms, known as the Orion–Cygnus Arm or Local Spur. The Sun lies between 25,000 and 28,000 light-years from the Galactic Centre, and its speed within <b>the</b> <b>Milky</b> Way is about 220km/s, so that it completes one revolution every 225–250 million years. This revolution {{is known as the}} Solar System's galactic year. The solar apex, the direction of the Sun's path through interstellar space, is near the constellation Hercules {{in the direction of the}} current location of the bright star Vega. The plane of the ecliptic lies at an angle of about 60° to the galactic plane.|$|E
