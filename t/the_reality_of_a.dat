5|$|In 1936, Ayer wrote Language, Truth and Logic, {{in which}} he claimed that {{religious}} language is meaningless. He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true, like mathematical statements. In doing so, he rejected metaphysics, which considers <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> world beyond the natural world and science. Because {{it is based on}} metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God– theistic, atheistic and agnostic– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.|$|E
25|$|Acceptance: A person's assent to <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> situation, {{recognizing}} {{a process}} or condition (often a difficult or uncomfortable situation) without attempting to change it, protest, or exit. Religions and psychological treatments often suggest {{the path of}} acceptance when a situation is both disliked and unchangeable, or when change may be possible only at great cost or risk.|$|E
25|$|Dein and Littlewood (2008) {{suggest that}} an individual’s prayer {{life can be}} viewed on a {{spectrum}} ranging from immature to mature. A progression on the scale {{is characterized by a}} change in the perspective of the purpose of prayer. Rather than using prayer as a means of changing <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> situation, a more mature individual will use prayer to request assistance in coping with immutable problems and draw closer to God or others. This change in perspective {{has been shown to be}} associated with an individual’s passage through adolescence.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} Magyarization {{did not succeed}} in {{imposing}} the Hungarian language as the most used language in all territories in the Kingdom of Hungary. In fact the profoundly multinational character of historic Transylvania was reflected in the fact that during the fifty years of the dual monarchy, the spread of Hungarian as the second language remained limited. In 1880, 5.7% of the non-Hungarian population, or 109,190 people, claimed to have a knowledge of the Hungarian language; the proportion rose to 11% (183,508) in 1900, and to 15.2% (266,863) in 1910. These figures reveal <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bygone era, one in which millions of people could conduct their lives without speaking the state's official language. The policies of Magyarization aimed to have a Hungarian language surname as a requirement for access to basic government services such as local administration, education, and justice.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{publication}} of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859, {{the position of the}} Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has slowly been refined. For about 100 years, there was no authoritative pronouncement on the subject, though many hostile comments were made by local church figures. In contrast with many Protestant objections, Catholic issues with evolutionary theory have {{had little to do with}} maintaining the literalism of the account in the Book of Genesis, and have always been concerned with the question of how man came to have a soul. Modern Creationism has had little Catholic support. In the 1950s, the Church's position was one of neutrality; by the late 20th century its position evolved to one of general acceptance in recent years. However, the church insists that the human soul was immediately infused by God, and <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single ancestor (commonly called monogenism) for the human race.|$|E
25|$|All that exists, {{throughout}} all time and beyond, is one infinite divine Consciousness, free and blissful, which projects {{within the field}} of its awareness a vast multiplicity of apparently differentiated subjects and objects: each object an actualization of a timeless potentiality inherent in the Light of Consciousness, and each subject the same plus a contracted locus of self-awareness. This creation, a divine play, {{is the result of the}} natural impulse within Consciousness to express the totality of its self-knowledge in action, an impulse arising from love. The unbounded Light of Consciousness contracts into finite embodied loci of awareness out of its own free will. When those finite subjects then identify with the limited and circumscribed cognitions and circumstances that make up this phase of their existence, instead of identifying with the transindividual overarching pulsation of pure Awareness that is their true nature, they experience what they call “suffering.” To rectify this, some feel an inner urge to take up the path of spiritual gnosis and yogic practice, the purpose of which is to undermine their misidentification and directly reveal within the immediacy of awareness the fact that the divine powers of Consciousness, Bliss, Willing, Knowing, and Acting comprise the totality of individual experience as well—thereby triggering a recognition that one’s real identity is that of the highest Divinity, the Whole in every part. This experiential gnosis is repeated and reinforced through various means until it becomes the nonconceptual ground of every moment of experience, and one’s contracted sense of self and separation from the Whole is finally annihilated in the incandescent radiance of the complete expansion into perfect wholeness. Then one’s perception fully encompasses <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> universe dancing ecstatically in the animation of its completely perfect divinity.|$|E

500|$|Hawley {{noted that}} many US {{television}} series are filmed in Vancouver, and it [...] "offers an amazing array of looks and feels and, obviously, a great crew base and everything." [...] Sets {{for the series}} were constructed in a former supermarket warehouse in Burnaby, including a [...] "23,000-square-foot set" [...] for the interior of Clockworks Mental Hospital. Wylie called this the most complicated set, and felt [...] "trying to make a hospital feel fun is a perfect challenge." [...] The most difficult set for Wylie to create was the ice room inhabited by Oliver Bird in the astral plane, which he had to create in seven days. Wylie initially looked to have the set built by [...] "those people who make giant sheets of ice for ice sculptures and stuff", before eventually building the set out of visqueen. However, this did not work, and was a [...] "gigantic disappointment". Wylie had the set rebuilt within a week, with the second version using acrylic molded to look like thick sheets of ice. Another notable set featured a giant volume knob which Haller turns to [...] "control {{the volume of the}} voices he hears in his head". This was compared to the effects of films like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and The Incredible Shrinking Man, and described by Gonzales as [...] "classic Noah Hawley". The sequence was filmed at the end of production on the season, and added to the second episode. All of Wylie's sets were built with [...] "external lighting features" [...] that could be controlled from a board, allowing the cinematographers to be flexible with lighting [...] "given that <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> location can change drastically depending on our main character’s perceptions and actions." ...|$|E

[...] "Modern orthodoxy", then, as opposed to constituting an ideological spectrum centred on a common core of values, is, in fact, (tending towards) several entirely separate movements. In fact, [...] "any are making the argument {{that the time has come}} to state the inevitable or to admit that which already has occurred: There is no longer a cohesive, singular Modern Orthodoxy.

2500|$|The Tonkin campaign, a {{struggle}} by France since June 1883 against various opponents, including Vietnamese forces {{under the command}} of Prince Hoang Ke Viem, Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army, and finally the Chinese Yunnan and Guangxi Armies, officially came to an end in early 1886. [...] On the recommendation of General Charles-Auguste-Louis Warnet (1828–1913), the commander-in-chief of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, Tonkin was declared 'pacified' in April 1886, and this achievement was symbolised by the formal downgrading of the expeditionary corps into a division of occupation {{under the command of}} General Ferdinand Jamont (1831–1918).

2500|$|Another camp {{believes}} that the witches' mark is a gendered aspect of the witch-hunts. In Anne Barstow's book, Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts, the witches' mark is viewed from a feminist perspective. Barstow sees the witch hunts of Europe {{as an attempt to}} control women, and the witches' mark as an excuse to control women's bodies through violence and sadism. The searching of women's bodies for the witches' mark gives insight into <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman's position during this time: [...] "when 'a personable and good-like woman' was defended by one of the local gentry the pricker argued that, having been accused, she must be tried anyway".

2500|$|When the act {{to alter}} the Queen's title was in 1953 debated in the House of Commons, St. Laurent {{asserted}} {{on the nature of}} the separate and shared characteristics of the Crown: [...] "Her Majesty is now Queen of Canada but she is the Queen of Canada because she is Queen of the United Kingdom... It is not a separate office." [...] Parliament then unanimously passed the new Royal Style and Titles Act, which was granted Royal Assent and proclaimed by Governor General Vincent Massey on 29 May 1953, just four days before Elizabeth II was crowned. The new legislation conferred publicly and legally <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> unique constitutional monarchy for Canada, thereby fulfilling the vision of the Fathers of Confederation. The Royal Style and Titles Act was amended in 1985, though it did not alter the Queen's title in any way.|$|E
2500|$|Meles {{became the}} first Ethiopian leader to develop a multi-party system, {{including}} an opposition party, in the Ethiopian parliament. Though the country had its first national elections in 1995, a multi-party representative government was established in 2005, after the election of some candidates of the UEDF opposition party. Critics of the CUD included top UEDF leaders, Dr. Merera Gudina and Dr. Beyene Petros, and also Bulcha Demeksa, Lidetu Ayalew, Hailu Shawel, Birtukan Mideksa, Temesgen Zewdie and Hailu Araya. Many opposing politicians openly display deep anger for the ruling party's semblance of democracy, with some having labeled Meles a [...] "dictator" [...] and others having called for his resignation. After the disputed 2005 national elections, opposition party members, led by the CUD, UEDP-Medhin, UEDF and Oromo Federalist Democratic Movement (OFDM), filled almost {{one third of the}} Ethiopian parliament seats. Despite the fact that the Ethiopian constitution dictates a multi-party system, Meles' full control of the military forces seemingly promoted <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single-party state.|$|E

2500|$|Christian Science, {{a system}} of thought and {{practice}} derived from the writings of Mary Baker Eddy, interprets the Book of Genesis figuratively rather than literally. It holds that the material world is an illusion, and consequently not created by God: the only real creation is the spiritual realm, of which the material world is a distorted version. Christian Scientists regard {{the story of the}} creation in the Book of Genesis as having symbolic rather than literal meaning. According to Christian Science, [...] both creationism and evolution are false from an absolute or [...] "spiritual" [...] point of view, as they both proceed from a (false) belief in <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> material universe. However, Christian Scientists do not oppose the teaching of evolution in schools, nor do they demand that alternative accounts be taught: they believe that both material science and literalist theology are concerned with the illusory, mortal and material, rather than the real, immortal and spiritual. With regard to material theories of creation, Eddy showed a preference for Darwin's theory of evolution over others.|$|E
