5|$|Businesses in Chinatown {{attempted}} to raise $200,000 {{to build an}} 11-story bell tower pagoda {{at the south end}} of the park. The tower was planned to be constructed of brick and stone with a hollow interior. While visitors would not have been able to climb the structure, they would have been able to walk through an entrance at its base. Chicago Sun-Times writer Lee Bey believed the bell tower to be the park's most important feature. Despite the Taiwanese government making an early commitment <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>finance</b> the tower, it was never constructed.|$|E
5|$|The city grew rapidly, {{primarily}} {{attributable to}} its location along the east–west transcontinental railroad {{line in the}} United States. In the 1880s, the railroads purchased land in the west from the federal government, which was then sold to individuals <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>finance</b> the railroad projects. By the 1890s, Flagstaff found itself located along {{one of the busiest}} railroad corridors in the U.S., with 80–100 trains travelling through the city every day, destined for Chicago, Los Angeles, and elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|In April 1997, Marvel was in {{negotiations}} with Mark Gordon and Gary Levinsohn to produce Captain America, and Larry Wilson and Leslie Bohem were set to write a script. In May 2000, Marvel teamed with Artisan Entertainment <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>finance</b> the film. However, a lawsuit arose between Marvel Comics and Joe Simon over the ownership of Captain America copyrights, disrupting the development process of the film. The lawsuit was eventually settled in September 2003. In 2005, Marvel received a $525 million investment from Merrill Lynch, allowing them to independently produce ten films, including Captain America. Paramount Pictures agreed to distribute the film.|$|E
5|$|The first Games {{held under}} the auspices of the IOC was hosted in the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens in 1896. The Games brought {{together}} 14 nations and 241 athletes who competed in 43 events. Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas had left the Greek government a trust to fund future Olympic Games. This trust was used <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>finance</b> the 1896 Games. George Averoff contributed generously for the refurbishment of the stadium in preparation for the Games. The Greek government also provided funding, which was expected to be recouped through the sale of tickets and from the sale of the first Olympic commemorative stamp set.|$|E

5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} a {{contract}} by Norwich City manager John Bond, but the offer was bettered by Colin Addison at Derby County, and he verbally agreed a three-year contract with Derby. However, before signing the contract he received a late offer from Ken Knighton to play for Sunderland on a £300 a week contract with a £20,000 signing on fee – which more than quadrupled his wage at Bolton. Knighton appointed him as club captain. However Allardyce soon wearied of the long-distance travel from Sunderland {{to his home in}} Bolton, and put in a transfer request when chairman Tom Cowie refused <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>finance</b> the purchase of a home in Sunderland. Cowie sacked Knighton late in the 1980–81 season, leaving caretaker manager Mick Docherty in charge to steer the club out of the First Division relegation zone. New manager Alan Durban left Allardyce out of the team {{at the start of the}} 1981–82 campaign, leaving Allardyce's departure from Roker Park inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Although tape {{samplers}} {{had been}} explored in research studios, the first commercially available keyboard-driven tape instruments were built and sold by California-based Harry Chamberlin. The {{concept of the}} Mellotron originated when Chamberlin's sales agent, Bill Fransen, brought two of Chamberlin's Musicmaster 600 instruments to England in 1962 to search for someone who could manufacture 70 matching tape heads for future Chamberlins. He met Frank, Norman and Les Bradley of tape engineering company Bradmatic Ltd, who said they could improve on the original design. The Bradleys subsequently met bandleader Eric Robinson, who agreed <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>finance</b> the recording of the necessary instruments and sounds. Together with the Bradleys and television celebrity David Nixon, they formed a company, Mellotronics, in order to market the instrument. Robinson was particularly enthusiastic about the Mellotron, because he felt it would revitalise his career, which was then on the wane. He arranged the recording sessions at IBC Studios in London, which he co-owned with George Clouston.|$|E

5|$|As World War II neared, Minton took a {{cautious}} position on United States involvement. When the Soviet Union invaded Finland, Minton voted against granting a loan to Finland <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>finance</b> its defense efforts. He also opposed selling munitions and {{weapons to the}} Allies or the Axis powers. He advocated and supported expanding the American military and believed that American entry into the war was inevitable, but should be delayed as long as possible. He {{voted in favor of}} the Smith Act, which made it a crime to advocate the overthrow of the government, a law specifically targeted at communists and fascists in the United States. In his final year in office, there was considerable speculation in the press that Minton would be named to higher office by Roosevelt, including cabinet positions and the Supreme Court, but neither happened.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, facing {{cash flow}} problems, John Cleveland Osgood turned to George Jay Gould, a {{principal}} stockholder of the Denver and Rio Grande, for a loan. Gould, via Frederick Taylor Gates, Rockefeller's financial adviser, brought John D. Rockefeller in <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>finance</b> the loan. Analysis of the company's operations by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. showed {{a need for}} substantially more funds which were provided in exchange for acquisition of CF's subsidiaries such as the Colorado and Wyoming Railway Company, the Crystal River Railroad Company, and possibly the Rocky Mountain Coal and Iron Company. Control was passed from the Iowa Group to Gould and Rockefeller interests in 1903 with Gould in control and Rockefeller and Gates representing a minority interests. Osgood left the company in 1904 and devoted his efforts to operating competing coal and coke operations.|$|E
5|$|Sam Raimi {{originally}} {{envisioned the}} idea for Thor after making Darkman (1990); he met Stan Lee and pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox, {{but they did not}} understand it. Thor was abandoned until April 1997, when Marvel Studios was beginning to expand rapidly. The film gained momentum after the success of X-Men (2000). The plan was for Thor to be made for television. UPN was in talks for airing it; excited by the prospect, they pushed for a script and approached Tyler Mane to play Thor. In May 2000, Marvel Studios brought Artisan Entertainment <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>finance</b> it as a film, but by June 2004 the project still had yet to be patronised by a studio. Sony Pictures Entertainment finally purchased the film rights, and in December 2004 David S. Goyer was in negotiations to write and direct. By 2005, though there were talks between Goyer and Marvel, Goyer was no longer interested, though at this point the film was still set to be distributed through Sony Pictures.|$|E

5|$|There {{were also}} some {{plans for the}} future which would remove the last ferries within the Sotra and Øygarden {{archipelago}}s, meaning that the entire twin archipelago would have ferry-free access to the mainland, should the Sotra Bridge be built. The plans had been spurred by a large decrease in fishing during the late 1950s, and the need for increased tax revenue from new industries. The framework for the plan started in 1961 with the creation of an inter-municipal cooperation, which in 1964 resulted in the merger of the municipalities of Hjelme and Herdla to create Øygarden. On 8 May 1962, an inter-municipal road committee was established, which recommended that a limited company be established to finance the bridge. In Bergen, Bro og Tunnelselskapet had similarly built the Puddefjord Bridge and Eidsvåg Tunnel, and the inter-municipal council recommended a similar model. However, they wanted a separate company for Sotra and Øygarden, so extra tolls could be used <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>finance</b> road projects on the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|With the {{extension}} to Paddington still under construction, the LER published {{a bill in}} November 1911 for the continuation to Queen's Park. The extension was to continue north from Paddington, running past Little Venice to Maida Vale before curving north-west to Kilburn and then west to parallel the LNWR main line, {{before coming to the}} surface a short distance to the east of Queen's Park station. Three intermediate stations were to be provided: on Warwick Avenue at the junction with Warrington Avenue, Clifton Villas and Clifton Gardens; at the junction of Elgin and Randolph Avenues (named Maida Vale); and on Cambridge Avenue (named Kilburn Park). The LNWR gave a £1 million loan to the LER at 4% interest in perpetuity <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>finance</b> {{the extension}}. The bill received royal assent on 7 August 1912 as the London Electric Railway Act, 1912.|$|E
5|$|As the {{university}} grew, McMaster Hall started to become overcrowded. The suggestion to move {{the university}} to Hamilton was first brought up by a student and Hamilton native in 1909, although the proposal was not seriously considered by the university until two years later. By the 1920s, after previous proposals between various university staff, the Hamilton Chamber of Commerce launched a campaign to bring McMaster University to Hamilton. As the issue of space at McMaster Hall became more acute, the university administration debated {{the future of the}} university. The university nearly became federated with the University of Toronto, as had been the case with Trinity College and Victoria College. Instead, in 1927, the university administration decided to transfer the university to Hamilton. The Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec secured $1.5 million, while the citizens of Hamilton raised an additional $500,000 <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>finance</b> the move. The lands for the university and new buildings were secured through gifts from graduates. Lands were transferred from Royal Botanical Gardens to establish the campus area. The first academic session on the new Hamilton campus began in 1930. McMaster's property in Toronto was sold to the University of Toronto when McMaster moved to Hamilton in 1930. McMaster Hall is now home to the Royal Conservatory of Music.|$|E

5|$|In 1097, the Crusader armies {{assembled}} at Constantinople having {{traveled in}} groups eastward through Europe. Alexios I, who had requested only some western knights {{to serve as}} mercenaries to help fight the Seljuk Turks, blockaded these armies {{in the city and}} would not permit them to leave until their leaders swore oaths promising to restore to the Empire any land formerly belonging to it that they might conquer on the way to Jerusalem. The Crusaders eventually swore these oaths, individually rather than as a group. In return, Alexios gave them guides and a military escort. The Crusaders were however exasperated by Byzantine tactics, such as negotiating the surrender of Nicaea from the Seljuks while it was still under siege by the Crusaders, who hoped to plunder it <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>finance</b> their journey. The Crusaders, feeling betrayed by Alexios, who was able to recover a number of important cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor, continued on their way without Byzantine aid. In 1098, when Antioch had been captured after a long siege and the Crusaders were in turn themselves besieged in the city, Alexios marched out to meet them, but, hearing from Stephen of Blois that the situation was hopeless, he returned to Constantinople. The Crusaders, who had unexpectedly withstood the siege, believed Alexios had abandoned them and considered the Byzantines completely untrustworthy. Therefore, they regarded their oaths as invalidated.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War economy catalyzed a {{shortage}} of United States coinage—gold and silver coins were hoarded given their intrinsic bullion value relative to irredeemable paper currency at the time. In late 1861, <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>finance</b> the Civil War, the U.S. government borrowed gold coin from New York City banks in exchange for Seven-thirties treasury notes and the New York banks sold them {{to the public for}} gold to repay the loan. In December 1861, the Trent Affair shook public confidence with the threat of war on a second front. The United States Department of the Treasury suspended specie payments and banks in New York City stopped redeeming paper money for gold and silver. In the absence of gold and silver coin, the premium for specie began to devalue paper currency. After the New York banks suspended specie payments (quickly followed by Boston and Philadelphia) the premium on gold rose from 1–3% over paper in early January 1862 to 9% over paper in June 1862, by which time one paper dollar was worth 91.69 cents in gold. This fueled currency speculation (e.g., redeeming banknotes for silver coin which was then sold at a premium as bullion), and created significant disruption across businesses and trade. Alternate methods of providing small change included the reintroduction of Spanish quarter dollars in Philadelphia, cutting dollar bills in quarters or halves, refusing to provide change (without charging a premium for providing silver coins), or the issuance of locally issued shinplasters (i.e., those issued by businesses or local municipalities) was forbidden by law in many states.|$|E
