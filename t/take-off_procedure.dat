5000|$|As [...] "runways at sea", {{aircraft}} carriers have a flat-top flight deck, which launches and recovers aircraft. Aircraft launch forward, into the wind, and are recovered from astern. The flight deck {{is where the}} most notable differences between a carrier and a land runway are found. Creating such a surface at sea poses constraints on the carrier - for example, {{the fact that it}} is a ship means that a full-length runway would be costly to construct and maintain. This affects <b>take-off</b> <b>procedure,</b> as a shorter runway length of the deck requires that aircraft accelerate more quickly to gain lift. This either requires a thrust boost, a vertical component to its velocity, or a reduced take-off load (to lower mass). The differing types of deck configuration, as above, influence the structure of the flight deck. The form of launch assistance a carrier provides is strongly related to the types of aircraft embarked and the design of the carrier itself.|$|E

The state space {{of the system is}} described by identifying all the possible components of the system. The ground and local controls monitor queues of the aircrafts moving from taxiway to take-off. It is insured that once an aircraft is inserted into a queue, it is eventually removed from it after the next queue has become available.

30|$|In this paper, formal {{procedure}} of managing air traffic at airport from taxiing to take-off is provided using graph theory and VDM-SL. The detailed information, for example, wind speed and direction, aircraft type, aircraft weight, weather conditions which may change a runway configuration, in reality {{are not considered}} in defining the <b>take-off</b> <b>procedure.</b> Such simplifications are made because our objective is to describe a simple and abstract model which {{can be applied to}} any real world ATC system after refinement. The VDM-SL is applied because of its detailed descriptive power and rigorous computer tool (SCSK 2013). The VDM-SL toolbox (SCSK 2013) is used for analysing properties of ATC system in terms of invariants over the data types and pre/post conditions over the operations.|$|E
40|$|Summary. The {{rotation}} and flare-up {{phases of the}} take-off of a slender-wing supersonic transport aircraft are studied by calculating the time histories of speed, height, etc. when the pitch-attitude time history is specified. The shape of the attitude function is fixed but its maximum attitude and duration, and the rotation speed at which it starts, may be varied to show {{the effect on the}} performance of variations in the <b>take-off</b> <b>procedure.</b> Both three and four engine rake-offs are examined and the influence of the ground on lift, drag and pitching moment is included. Only small variations in achieved {{rotation and}} unstick speeds can be permitted if low climb gradients or large take-off distance are to be avoided. Low rotation rates of about 1 - 2 deg/sec are preferable...|$|E
30|$|The airport {{surface is}} {{represented}} by a graph relation. Taxiways are represented as paths by adding more information about state space of the system in VDM-SL. Formal specification of permissible aircrafts and runways is described as mappings. Main possible operations are defined to describe taxiing to <b>take-off</b> <b>procedure.</b> The safety criteria are {{described in terms of}} invariants over the data types carrying the critical information. The pre/post conditions of operations are verified for consistency and correctness. The model is based on next generation ATC systems which are used to shift from traditional ground stations to modern navigation systems (Erzberger and Heere 2009). The preliminary results were presented in (Yousaf et al. 2012) in which arrival and departure procedures were described using VDM++. The model was improved by linking graph theory and Z notation at an abstract level of specification. The improved model is different from the existing work (Zafar 2014) due to various reasons. For example, the proposed model is modified based on the errors identified in the existing work. Further, few unnecessary queues were defined in the <b>take-off</b> <b>procedure</b> which are removed to increase simplicity of the model. Few assumptions are reviewed in functionality of ground and local controllers as in real ATC systems. For example, it is supposed that taxiing aircraft is under both the ground and local controllers. The same assumption was taken in (Zafar 2014) but it was not described correctly in the formal specification. The model is refined in depth and is near to implementation now for a realistic ATC system. Finally, a detailed model is described using VDM-SL, results are visualized by validation techniques available in VDM-SL toolbox to increase a confidence. Rest of the paper is organized as: An introduction to modelling complex systems is presented in next subsection. Problem statement and methods are given in section “Methods”. Formal description and analysis of the algorithm is described in section “Results and discussion”. The relevant work is discussed critically in section “Related work”. Conclusion and future work are discussed in section “Conclusions”.|$|E

50|$|Water {{injection}} use in {{turbine engines}} has been limited, again, mostly to military aircraft. Many pictures are available of Boeing B-52 takeoffs that clearly show the black smoke emitted by turbine engines running with water injection. For early B-52s, water injection {{was seen as}} a vital part of <b>take-off</b> <b>procedures.</b> For later versions of the B-52 as well as later turbine-powered bombers, the problem of taking off heavily loaded from short runways was solved by the use of more powerful engines that had not been available previously.|$|R
40|$|Runway {{pavement}} design and maintenance are a demanding task nowadays both for civil and military airport authorities, and for managing authorities. Mechanistic and empirical mechanistic approaches require {{a more accurate}} assessment of actions exerted by aircraft landing gears. Therefore the evaluation of aircraft positioning on runway and the analysis of aircrafts' kinematic characteristics in landing and take-off operations appears fundamental. Following an experimental investigation carried out on an Italian airport, aircraft kinematic data were collected using several video cameras. Landing and <b>take-off</b> <b>procedures</b> were reviewed and a {{statistical analysis was performed}} to model touchdown points' longitudinal and transversal distribution.

40|$|This paper compares three {{possible}} linear motor topologies for an electromagnetic launch system to assist civil aircraft take-off. Assisted launch of civil aircraft {{has the potential}} of reducing the required runway length, reducing noise and emissions near airports and improving overall aircraft efficiency through reducing engine thrust requirements. A comparison is made of practical designs of a linear induction motor, a linear permanent magnet synchronous motor and a superconducting linear synchronous motor to propel the A 320 - 200 aircraft. The machine design requirements are established considering aerodynamic and engine performance and allow the aircraft to safely complete the <b>take-off</b> <b>procedure.</b> Analytical design of conventional synchronous and asynchronous linear motor will be compared with finite element analysis.

30|$|The {{safety is}} {{achieved}} by defining properties in terms of invariants available in VDM-SL over the data in the static model. The safety in dynamic model is provided by defining pre and post conditions over the operations for manipulating critical information to prevent any unwanted situation. The model is analysed and validated by testing and animation facilities available in the VDM-SL toolbox. The efficiency in the system is claimed because the model is assumed {{for the next generation}} ATC system which will expedite the <b>take-off</b> <b>procedure.</b> In addition, the model is based on graph theory which is used for defining the optimal routes in the dynamic part of the model. The model in graph theory can easily be extended to automate the algorithm increasing significance of the approach because automata are the special types of graphs. Finally, the constraints are put to ensure minimal queue size of aircrafts enhancing efficiency of the system.|$|E
30|$|Although {{there exist}} various {{computer}} models of ATC system but {{the safety and}} efficiency of the system are required to be addressed with further details. For example, there is some good work on modelling of ATC systems {{as reported in the}} related work however it needs to apply rigorous verifiable mathematical approaches to address the next generation automated systems achieving the required level of safety and efficiency. The work of Koeners et al. was found interesting (Koeners et al. 2011) in which planning function is developed for taxiing operation to address the uncertainties based on the real data simulating scenarios-based approach. This work was a good starting point for us to expedite the <b>take-off</b> <b>procedure</b> at the airport. Most of the work on modelling of ATC system is based on simulation techniques which have various limitations. To overcome the weaknesses of simulation, formal validation and verification are processes that help to ensure that the computer models are correct and reliable. That is why VDM-SL was used in this research which is a formal specification language and it provided an exhaustive support for validation and verification of the algorithm.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{present an}} {{approach}} that builds upon previous developments in unmanned air vehicles and climbing robots and seeks to emulate the capabilities of bats, insects and certain birds that combine powered flight {{with the ability to}} land and perch on sloped and vertical surfaces. As it approaches a wall, the plane executes an intentional pitch-up maneuver to shed speed and present its feet for landing. On contact, a nonlinear suspension dissipates the remaining kinetic energy and directs interaction forces toward the feet to engage small asperities on surfaces such as brick or concrete. The focus of the work in this paper is on the controller used for sensing a wall and executing vertical landing and <b>take-off</b> <b>procedures</b> and on the mechanisms developed for spine engagement and disengagement.

Mechanistic and empirical mechanistic approaches require {{a more accurate}} assessment of actions exerted by aircraft landing gears. Therefore the evaluation of aircraft positioning on runway appears fundamental. Following an experimental investigation carried out on an Italian airport, aircraft kinematic data have been collected using several video cameras. Landing and <b>take-off</b> <b>procedures</b> have been reviewed and statistical analysis has been performed to model touchdown point longitudinal and transversal distribution. Preliminary comparison with data derived by technical literature has shown a good agreement; conversely, a new stochastic model is proposed for the transversal distribution of aircrafts' paths.

30|$|Similar to {{the last}} approach, the Zafar (2016) authors combine a VDM-SL and graph theory to build a formal {{specification}} of aircrafts <b>take-off’s</b> <b>procedure.</b> This formal specification of graph-based model, taxiways, aircrafts, runways and controllers is provided in the static part of the model. The state space analysis describing take-off algorithms is provided by defining optimal paths and possible operations in a dynamic model expediting the departure procedure. The model is developed {{by a series of}} refinements following the stepwise development approach. Although this work presents a detailed specification of the departure procedure, but it requires further investigation to real-time management that is a major factor in this procedure. On the other hand, Dominique and Neeraj (2014) introduces a formal model of an aircraft landing system. This work considered as a benchmark for techniques and tools dedicated to the verification of behavioral properties of the landing system. However, it neglects the procedure of landing which must be taken into consideration to ensure system safety and focus more on the mechanical system.|$|R
30|$|Complex Adaptive Systems are dynamic {{networks}} {{with many}} agents which are constantly acting and reacting {{in response to}} the other agents. The control of CAS is decentralized which needs to have a coherent behaviour which is achieved by a large number of decisions made by many agents in competition and cooperation among themselves. CAS can be characterized by various critical properties including emergence, co-evolution, sub-optimality, variety, connectivity, iteration, self organisation and nesting. By considering all such characteristics, we can find many CAS all around us. The development of CAS can be done by the combination of both the mathematical modelling and computer simulation techniques. The CAS are commonly investigated by agent-based methodologies and complex networks which are being widely appreciated in the natural and social sciences. Both of these methodologies are based on simulation techniques for verification of the systems. The simulation techniques are lacking of in verifying correctness of the systems due to exponential increase of test cases to achieve the required level of confidence. Formal methods help to ensure that the models developed are correct and reliable to overcome the disadvantages of simulation. That is why a formal approach in term of VDM-SL is used in modelling of the system underhand to provide an exhaustive support for verification of the <b>take-off</b> <b>procedure</b> of the ATC system.|$|E
40|$|While {{observing the}} dynamic {{increase}} in the intensity of air traffic, the issue of constant controlling and monitoring every individual operation carried out during the flight process becomes a vital matter. One {{of the most significant}} operations in this process is the aircraft’s <b>take-off</b> <b>procedure.</b> On the airports such procedures are observed quite frequently, with a rate of several dozen seconds up to few minutes. The correctness of carrying out the mentioned guidelines has a crucial impact on the traffic capacity of the runway, number of operations completed within the area of the airport and, above all, safety of passengers. The research and analysis of these processes cannot, for obvious reasons, be done on objects in real conditions. Therefore, {{there is a tendency to}} use IT tools and methods for the purpose of the analysis of the operations which occur in the area of the airport. In order to make use of the computer simulation it is essential to have mathematical models of these operations. The purpose of this article is to create models for particular stages of take-off operation and to identify elementary models of these stages based on parameters recorded by the on board flight recorder. The created mathematical and computer models (for simulation research), reproducing the aircraft’s real operations in the area of the airport, shall be used for automation of the operations conducted in the airport’s area. For the purpose of the analysis comparison of two models has been done to show the effects of conducting mathematical normalization of parameters prior to the analysis...|$|E
40|$|In direct {{response}} to Request for Proposals: Flight at very low Reynolds numbers - a station keeping mission, the members of Design Squad E present Project Dawdler: a remotely-piloted airplane supported by an independently controlled take-off cart. A brief introduction to Project Dawdler's overall mission and design, is given. The Dawdler is a remotely-piloted airplane designed to fly in an environmentally-controlled closed course at a Reynolds number of 10 (exp 5) and at a cruise velocity of 25 ft/s. The two primary goals were to minimize the flight Reynolds number and to maximize the loiter time. With this in mind, the general design of the airplane was guided by the belief that a relatively light aircraft producing a fairly large amount of lift {{would be the best}} approach. For this reason the Dawdler utilizes a canard rather than a conventional tail for longitudinal control, primarily because the canard contributes a positive lift component. The Dawdler also has a single vertical tail mounted behind the wing for lateral stability, half of which is used as a rudder for yaw control. Due {{to the fact that the}} power required to take-off and climb to altitude is much greater than that required for cruise flight and simple turning maneuvers, it was decided that a take-off cart be used. Based on the current design, there are two unknowns which could possibly threaten the success of Project Dawdler. First, the effect of the fully-movable canard with its large appropriation of total lift on the performance of the plane, and secondly, the ability of the <b>take-off</b> <b>procedure</b> to go as planned are examined. These are questions which can only be answered by a prototype...|$|E

50|$|In {{reviewing}} the two solutions for cooling, {{it was determined}} that the water/alcohol system would be the simplest to implement. No provision was made for a wheeled landing gear system and design skids were used. A nose skid was provided with a basic spring suspension to absorb the landing forces. Under each wing was a non-sprung skid arrangement supported by two struts. For take-off the Shinryū II was to use two wheeled dolly similar to the one used by the Mitsubishi J8M Shūsui. Once airborne the pilot could jettison the dolly. In addition to conventional runway <b>take-off</b> <b>procedures,</b> other methods for launching the Shinryū II were considered but what exactly these were is not known. It can be speculated that towing the Shinryū II aloft was one consideration. Another may have been air dropping the Shinryū II {{in the same manner as}} the Kūgishō MXY7 Ōka. In both cases this may have preserved two of the rocket engines which would have been used up had the Shinryū II taken off from the ground. In order to combat the B-29, which could operate at altitudes up to 10,241m (33,600 ft), the Shinryū II was to be equipped with a pressurised cockpit or, if such a cockpit proved problematic, the pilot would wear a pressure suit.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{whether it}} is possible for a machine to incrementally build a complex model of its environment, and then use this model for control purposes. Given a sequence of noisy observations, the machine forms a piecewise linear approximation to the nonlinear dynamic equations that are assumed to describe the real world. A number of existing online system identification techniques are examined, but it is found that they all either scale poorly with dimensionality, have a number of parameters that make them difficult to apply, or do not learn sufficiently accurate approximations. Therefore a novel framework is developed for learning linear model trees in both batch and online settings. The algorithms are evaluated empirically on a number of commonly used benchmark datasets, a simple test function, and three dynamic domains ranging from a simple pendulum to a complex flight simulator. The new batch algorithm is compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms and is seen to perform favourably overall. The new incremental model tree learner also compares well with a recent online function approximator from the literature. Armed with a tool for effectively constructing piecewise linear models of the environment, a control framework is developed that learns trajectories from a demonstrator and attempts to follow these trajectories within each linear region usinglinear quadratic control. The induced controllers are able to swing up and balance a simple forced pendulum both in simulation and in the real world. They can also swing up and balance a real double pendulum. The induced controllers are empirically shown to perform better than the original demonstrator, and could therefore be used to either replace a human operator or improve upon an existing automatic controller. In addition an ability to generalise the learnt trajectories enables the system to perform novel tasks. This is demonstrated on a flight simulator where, having observed an aircraft flying several times around a circuit, the controller is able to copy the <b>take-off</b> <b>procedure,</b> fly a completely new circuit that includes new manoeuvres, and successfully land the plane...|$|E
40|$|The ATISS {{measurement}} drone, {{developed at}} the University of Applied Sciences Wildau, is an electrical powered autonomous motor glider with a maximum take-off weight of 25 kg including a payload capacity of up to 10 kg. Two engines enable ultra short <b>take-off</b> <b>procedures</b> and the motor glider design results in a 1 h endurance. The concept of ATISS {{is based on the}} idea to strictly separate between aircraft and payload functions, which makes it a very flexible research platform for miscellaneous applications.

The aim was to integrate a system for digital terrain modelling. Instead of a laser scanner a new design concept was chosen based on two synchronized high resolution digital cameras, one in a fixed nadir orientation and the other in a oblique orientation. Thus from every object on the ground images from different view angles are taken. This new measurement camera system MACS-TumbleCam was {{developed at the}} German Aerospace Center DLR Berlin-Adlershof especially for the ATISS payload concept. Special advantage in comparison to laser scanning is the fact, that instead of a cloud of points a surface including texture is generated and a high-end inertial orientation system can be omitted.

40|$|The Air Traffic Management (ATM) {{paradigm}} is shifting towards a scenario where Trajectory Predictors (TP) {{play a key}} role. They rely on Aircraft Performance Models (APM), mathematical models of the performance related characteristics of aircraft. The widespread use of non-coventional <b>take-off</b> <b>procedures,</b> such as the flexible thrust method, has arose the necessity of modelling them to keep fidelity in take-off trajectory predictions. This project, carried out with Boeing Research & Technology Europe (BR&TE) and upon request of EUROCONROL, arises {{in response to the}} current lack in the APM market of a validated methodology to model reduced thrust operations. Its goal is to propose a complete and validated model to compute reduced thrust using Assumed Temperature (AT). The proposed methodology is composed by a model of AT and a thrust model properly validated for flexible thrust computations. To accomplish this goal, a new specification of the AT model that is being developed by BR&TE has been implemented, based upon a set of improvements suggested by EUROCONTROL. In order to determine a valid thrust model for flexible thrust computations, EUROCONTROL'S Base of Aricraft Data (BADA) and Aircraft Noise Performance (ANP) APMs have been validated. These validations have been carried out with different official Boeing's performance software: the Standard Take-off Analysis Software (STAS) and the Boeing Climbout Program (BCOP). As a result of the study different order polynomials that model the AT {{as a function of the}} take-off conditions have been produced. In addition, it has been concluded that ANP contains a valid thrust model for flexible thrust calculations, whereas the current version of BADA is not valid to compute thrust during the take-off phase. A first application of this method has been put into effect by developing a prototype of a Take-off Trajectory Predictor (TTP) that implements the flexible thrust model. This prototype is intended to be integrated in Boeing's trajectory computation infrastructure in the future as a take-off and landing module and needs to be improved, validated with Boeing's performance software and integrated as future work...|$|R
