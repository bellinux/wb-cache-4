5|$|According to a 2007 article, the mite Varroa {{destructor}} {{remains the}} world's most destructive honey bee killer, {{due in part}} to the viruses it carries, including deformed wing virus and acute bee paralysis virus, which have both been implicated in CCD. Affliction with Varroa mites also tends <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> immune system of the bees. Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the University of Guelph in Canada, studied 413 Ontario bee colonies in 2007–08. The presence of Varroa mites within colonies before winter was observed <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> immune systems of bees and introduce viruses that led to colony death during the winter. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the Varroa mite was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases. Varroa mites also affect the queen's ability to reproduce, which is detrimental to the survival of the hive. As such, Varroa mites have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these mites.|$|E

5|$|By 1796, {{the end of}} George Washington's eighth year as {{president}} of the United States, the United States' strategic position was dire. Interstate rivalries, violent insurrections (such as the Whiskey Rebellion), and solidifying opposition to the national government {{in the form of the}} Anti-Federalist Party combined with its dependence on trade with Europe <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> new nation. During this time, the country's increasingly-brittle government was held together almost entirely by Washington's charismatic authority.|$|E
5|$|Culturally, the wall's {{symbolic}} {{role as a}} {{line between}} civilized society and barbarism was suppressed by the Qing, who were keen <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> Han culturalism that had been propagated by the Ming.

5|$|During the Cold War, and {{particularly}} in the late 1950s, the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China adopted a strategy of destabilisation of Western powers by disruption of their hold on African colonies. Nikita Khrushchev, in particular, viewed the 'underdeveloped third of mankind' as a means <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> West. For the Soviets, Africa represented a chance to create a rift between western powers and their colonial assets, and create pro-communist states in Africa with which to foster future relations.|$|E

5|$|Although Kapoor {{does not}} draw with {{computer}}s, computer modeling {{was essential to}} the process of analyzing the complex form, which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat {{in a way that would}} make it too hot to touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> structure. Graffiti, bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface. The most pressing issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the external shell, a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to be nearly impossible.|$|E

5|$|Despite its rapid {{gains and}} popular backing, the new {{administration}} was marked by conflicts between the radical wing and more conservative forces, especially {{over the issue of}} land reform. Two successive abortive coups were able <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> Government, and its international status was always contested by Russia. After managing to rally a degree of sympathy from Ottoman political leaders, the Revolution was ultimately isolated by the intervention of Russian diplomats, and ultimately repressed by a common intervention of Ottoman and Russian armies, without any significant form of armed resistance. Nevertheless, over the following decade, the completion of its goals was made possible by the international context, and former revolutionaries became the original political class in united Romania.|$|E

5|$|The American {{government}} saw {{the evacuation}} {{as an opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> communists by providing for and thereby winning the loyalty of the refugees to the anti-communist cause. The United States Operation Mission proposed that aside from helping to evacuate refugees {{to the south and}} thereby draining the communist population base, the Americans should provide healthcare, shelter, food and clothing in order to help the anti-communists win the fidelity of their compatriots. Another benefit of participating in the evacuation was that American personnel would be on the ground in North Vietnam, allowing them to gather intelligence on communist activities.|$|E

By 1954, however, Democrat James Hugh Joseph Tate and others in Council attempted <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> civil service reforms of the new charter by allowing city employees to be active in party politics. Dallas stood with the reform wing of the party, and the amendment effort fell {{just short of the}} two-thirds vote in Council to put the proposed charter amendment on the ballot.

5|$|The {{hurricane}} moved westward {{due to a}} {{high pressure}} ridge while undergoing two eyewall replacement cycles: the first was around peak intensity and was completed when the hurricane moved over cooler waters, and the second was a brief cycle shortly after the hurricane began <b>to</b> <b>weaken.</b> <b>The</b> last advisory was issued while the hurricane was west of Mexico, {{but it was not}} until the remnants were west of Los Angeles, California that they finally dissipated. Elida's rapid intensification and unsteady weakening after reaching its peak intensity caused large errors in the intensity forecasting of the hurricane. Although the intensity forecasts were off, the track forecasts were better than usual compared to the ten-year period prior to that year.|$|E
5|$|The nascent magazine, {{under the}} {{editorial}} control of Armijn and Alisjahbana, was initially poorly received by {{political parties and}} actors; they considered the magazine, which was generally non-political, liable <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> nationalist movement by diverting it into less important areas. To guarantee better support, {{people who were not}} writers or literary critics were accepted onto the editorial board. The first, Sumadang, was accepted in 1935. Other politicians involved during the end of the 1930s included Amir Sjarifuddin, Mohamad Sjah, and Sugiarti. During this period the magazine began to have a wider scope.|$|E
5|$|The new {{government}} {{was faced with}} a major challenge: the Chamber of Deputies was divided into three groups: the ultraconservatives, the Moderates and the Liberals. Paranhos and Caxias named men who were either ultraconservatives or Moderates to the remaining portfolios, in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> <b>the</b> reinvigorated Liberal opposition and consolidate a workable governing majority. Despite successfully recruiting enough supporters from outside the party to form a government, the Cabinet was hobbled from the outset by its lack of internal unity. It was doomed when Paranhos's friend and former colleague in the Conciliation Cabinet, José Tomás Nabuco de Araújo, delivered a speech advocating a merger of Moderate Conservatives and Liberals into a truly new political party.|$|E
