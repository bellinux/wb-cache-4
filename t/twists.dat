5|$|Acorn Antiques {{is perhaps}} the best-remembered regular item from the series.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>TWIST</b> 1 gene has diverse {{roles in}} {{development}} and pathologic {{diseases such as}} cancer. <b>TWIST</b> 1 is a dimeric basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor existing as <b>TWIST</b> 1 -TWIST 1 or <b>TWIST</b> 1 -E 12 / 47. <b>TWIST</b> 1 partner choice and DNA binding can be influenced during development by phosphorylation of Thr 125 and Ser 127 of the Thr-Gln-Ser (TQS) motif within the bHLH of <b>TWIST</b> 1. The significance of these <b>TWIST</b> 1 phosphorylation sites for metastasis is unknown. We created stable isogenic prostate cancer cell lines overexpressing <b>TWIST</b> 1 wild-type, phospho-mutants, and tethered versions. We assessed these isogenic lines using assays that mimic stages of cancer metastasis. In vitro assays suggested the phospho-mimetic <b>Twist</b> 1 -DQD mutation could confer cellular properties associated with pro-metastatic behavior. The hypo-phosphorylation mimic <b>Twist</b> 1 -AQA mutation displayed reduced pro-metastatic activity compared to wild-type <b>TWIST</b> 1 in vitro, suggesting that phosphorylation of the <b>TWIST</b> 1 TQS motif was necessary for pro-metastatic functions. In vivo analysis demonstrates that the <b>Twist</b> 1 -AQA mutation exhibits reduced capacity to contribute to metastasis, whereas {{the expression of the}} <b>Twist</b> 1 -DQD mutation exhibits proficient metastatic potential. Tethered <b>TWIST</b> 1 -E 12 heterodimers phenocopied the <b>Twist</b> 1 -DQD mutation for many in vitro assays, suggesting that <b>TWIST</b> 1 phosphorylation may result in heterodimerization in prostate cancer cells. Lastly, the dual phosphatidylinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) -mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor BEZ 235 strongly attenuated <b>TWIST</b> 1 -induced migration that was dependent on the TQS motif. <b>TWIST</b> 1 TQS phosphorylation state determines the intensity of <b>TWIST</b> 1 -induced pro-metastatic ability in prostate cancer cells, which may be partly explained mechanistically by <b>TWIST</b> 1 dimeric partner choice...|$|R
