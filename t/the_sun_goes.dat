Polls conducted by Gallup in the 1990s found that 16% of Germans, 18% of Americans and 19% of Britons hold that the Sun revolves around the Earth. A study conducted in 2005 by Jon D. Miller of Northwestern University, {{an expert in the}} public understanding of science and technology, found that about 20%, or one in five, of American adults believe that the Sun orbits the Earth. According to 2011 VTSIOM poll, 32% of Russians believe that the Sun orbits the Earth.|$|E

While some critics called it one of the standout tracks of When <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>Goes</b> Down, others dismissed its rap sections and lyrics.

500|$|... "Whiplash" [...] is a dance {{song with}} {{influences}} of electro. It features a heavy usage of synthesizers, which {{were compared to}} those in Christina Aguilera's [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] (2010). During the pre-chorus, there is a sing-rap section in which Gomez delivers several phrases in a thick British accent, before the pulsating chorus begins. [...] "Whiplash" [...] has a much more aggressive vibe than the typical teen pop sound. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, it is written in the key of D minor. The song runs through a shuffle beat and maintains a tempo of 138 beat per minute. Gomez's vocal range spans from the high-tone of A3 to the lower register of B4. It is also musically different and a departure from other songs in When <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>Goes</b> Down which are more straightforward pop, such as [...] "Who Says" [...] and [...] "Bang Bang Bang".|$|E
500|$|In 1895, Krøyer {{wrote to}} his friend Oscar Björck: [...] "I am also {{thinking}} of painting a large portrait of {{my wife and me}} together — but for that I shall definitely need good weather, so it won't be this year." [...] In fact it was four years later, in the summer of 1899, that he finally created the large painting Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife. The result nevertheless has a rather melancholic tone. Despite the beautiful surroundings, Marie appears distant, disappearing into the blue moonlight. Even Krøyer's own weak figure seems to be experiencing difficulty in supporting her on his arm while the closest figure of all is Rap the dog. The painting again presents the blue half-light. Krøyer particularly appreciated [...] "l'heure bleue": [...] "Skagen can look so terribly dull in the bright sunlight ... but when <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>goes</b> down, when the moon rises up out of the sea ... in recent years this has been the time I like most of all." ...|$|E

Throughout the first verse and chorus, Lovato dances around on stage with Manhattan Bridge visible in the background. Following the first chorus, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>goes</b> down and an aerial shot of the city's nightlife is shown. The second verse and chorus are performed during night.

After this, she is back on stage and performing the last chorus during nighttime with bright lights in the background. The video ends with the performance being finished, with Lovato turning around and walking towards her band.|$|E

500|$|... "Whiplash" [...] has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Tim Sendra of Allmusic selected {{it as one}} of the 'track picks' of When <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>Goes</b> Down, calling it a [...] "stomping jam" [...] and one of the surprises of the album. He stated that the song [...] "adds some welcome weirdness to an otherwise straightforward record." [...] In a positive review, Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post suggested that [...] "Whiplash" [...] was better than at least five songs from Spears's seventh studio album Femme Fatale (2011), saying [...] "what I can't figure out is {{why in the world would}} [...] give up this hot track". Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "the top-shelf collaborators don't hurt — see: the grinding 'Whiplash,' co-penned by one Britney Spears." [...] Scott Shetler of PopCrush gave the song four stars out of five, explaining that it [...] "possesses a hook that will send people running for the dance floor", although [...] "Gomez's vocal is pretty flat [...] but then again, this isn't the kind of song to show off any sort of vocal gymnastics." ...|$|E
500|$|At Mount Magic, Lionel {{is upset}} because Leonard {{abandoned}} him, and goes {{outside to the}} balcony, where he spots Callie swimming in the lake while wearing a bikini, and he declares that [...] "she will be mine". Mark arrives at the lake and sees Leonard from the balcony and tells him that he forgot to sign his retirement forms. Leonard explains how {{to come to the}} secret entrance to Mark, which the demons hear. Later, Mark meets Leonard and Lionel at the entrance, where he signs his forms and is ready to retire. Moments later, when initiation ceremony begins at Mount Magic, the demons invade the compound and a battle between wizards and demons commences, while Lionel runs away to be with Callie, who, being the camp's [...] "sexy counselor", has sex with him before Mark interrupts. Grimes arrives with his army of bears and soon thereafter, Doug arrives in a hole that he dug; the hole collapses the floor and all the demons and bears are consumed by it. As the battle ends, <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>goes</b> down and it is too late for Lionel to be circumcised and take over as the Wizard of Social Services, so Leonard continues to work and begins to raise a new egg.|$|E
500|$|Kenyon {{was born}} on 5 November 1732 in Gredington, Flintshire to Lloyd Kenyon, a country gentleman and Justice of the peace, and his wife Jane Eddowes. He was {{initially}} educated at a school in Hanmer – it was written that [...] "no man ever set out on his career with fewer advantages" [...] than Kenyon. When he was 12 {{he was sent to}} Ruthin School, where he learnt French and Latin, and was considered one of the best students at the school. His knowledge of Greek was non-existent, and his scientific training minor; [...] "he was said to have believed to his dying day that <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>goes</b> around the earth". As a second son, he had initially considered joining the clergy, but instead decided on the law and spent 5 years working as a clerk to Mr W.J. Tomkinson, an attorney. He proved to be an excellent clerk, becoming a [...] "rapid and accurate conveyancer". Originally happy with the idea of being a simple attorney, {{after the death of his}} older brother it was instead assumed he would become a barrister, and Kenyon joined the Middle Temple in November 1750. In February 1755 he left Tomkinson's practice and moved to London, where he was called to the Bar on 10 February 1756.|$|E
