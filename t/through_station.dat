5|$|In December 2001, the 63rd Street Tunnel Connection opened, {{allowing}} trains {{from the}} IND Queens Boulevard Line {{to use the}} line. This station then became a <b>through</b> <b>station,</b> serving F express trains since then.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{station was}} {{originally}} {{built by the}} City & South London Railway (C), and opened on 17 November 1901 as the northern terminus of a new extension from Moorgate. The station building was designed by Sydney Smith {{and was on the}} corner of City Road and Torrens Street. On 12 May 1907, the C opened a further extension from Angel to Euston and Angel became a <b>through</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E

5|$|Between 1930 and 1935 the <b>through</b> <b>station</b> was {{expanded}} {{under the direction}} of the GWR's chief architect P E Culverhouse, in art deco style, both eastwards over the old cattle market and southwards on a new wider bridge across Cattle Market Road and the New Cut of the River Avon. This made room for the addition of five through-platform faces, while the removal of the narrow island platforms in the middle of the train shed allowed the main Up and Down platforms to be both widened and lengthened. All the routes approaching Temple Meads were widened to four tracks to allow more flexibility.|$|E
5|$|The B {{converted}} {{the line to}} Taunton to mixed gauge by 1 June 1875, but {{the remainder of the}} line to Exeter was not done until 1 March 1876, three months after the B had amalgamated with the GWR. The remainder of the lines beyond Exeter were converted to standard gauge on 21 May 1892 so the extra rails at Temple Meads fell into disuse and were removed to leave a purely standard gauge layout. This allowed the <b>through</b> <b>station</b> to be rebuilt with two additional platform faces.|$|E
5|$|This {{station was}} opened in March 1933 as the {{original}} terminus of the Culver Line, which was referred to then as the Smith Street Line or the South Brooklyn Line. The station opened {{in advance of the}} opening of the remainder of the line to allow for it to compete with existing streetcar lines belong to the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation. Once the rest of the line was ready, in October 1933, the line was extended, making this stop a normal <b>through</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E

25|$|The next {{development}} was {{the opening of}} the Bourne and Spalding Railway in 1866, converting the site into a <b>through</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Bridge Street {{terminus}} was jointly operated {{with the}} Glasgow and South Western Railway (G); {{it had to}} be reconstructed as a <b>through</b> <b>station,</b> and the Greenock line trains (operated by the Caledonian) continued to use it.|$|E

50|$|The Chuo Rapid Line {{is known}} for {{a high number of}} suicides, {{primarily}} due to the high speed at which some trains pass <b>through</b> <b>stations</b> on the line.|$|R
25|$|The {{station is}} {{designed}} to serve up to 10,500 passengers during the peak hour as a terminus. Capacity increases will probably not be possible without turning Britomart into a <b>through</b> <b>station,</b> with a tunnel underneath Auckland CBD (see City Rail Link section below).|$|E
25|$|Commentator Brian Rudman {{noted that}} it would make the most sense for a new {{crossing}} to be dedicated to public transport only, possibly connecting with a rail tunnel from the Western Reclamation to Britomart Transport Centre, providing an alternate way of making Britomart a <b>through</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
25|$|There was an {{important}} quarry and stone crushing plant at Billacombe, which despatched stone by rail. At Yealmpton the station was configured as a <b>through</b> <b>station,</b> because of the original intention to continue to Modbury. There was a small quay at Steer Point, and steamers operated from there to Newton Ferrers; there was some daily commuting by train and steamer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} rate depends greatly {{on the material}} thickness and the bend radius; it is however also affected {{by the number of}} required stations or steps. For bend radii of 50 times the material thickness of a low carbon steel 0.7 inch mm thick can range from [...] <b>through</b> eight <b>stations</b> to [...] <b>through</b> 12 <b>stations</b> or [...] <b>through</b> 22 <b>stations.</b>|$|R

50|$|Regular rail {{services}} {{operate from}} Merthyr Tydfil railway <b>station,</b> <b>through</b> <b>stations</b> at Pentrebach, Troedyrhiw, Merthyr Vale and Quakers Yard in the County Borough to Cardiff Queen Street and Cardiff Central. Public transport links to Cardiff are being improved.|$|R
25|$|The LBSCR {{equipped}} the new Stoats Nest {{station with}} 4 platforms: {{two on the}} Quarry Line and two terminal platforms with through access only to sidings beyond the station. It served as a <b>through</b> <b>station</b> for services from London Victoria to Brighton, {{as well as a}} terminus for services from Victoria via Streatham Common or Crystal Palace. The station also had a six-road carriage storage area just to its south.|$|E
25|$|Initially seen as underused and too costly, {{it is now}} {{considered}} a great success, heading for capacity with the growing uptake of rail commuting. Limitations on further patronage are primarily due to the access tunnel from the east which provides only two rail tracks, {{and the lack of}} a through connection via a rail link to the North Shore or to the Western line via an underground tunnel, which would change it into a <b>through</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cork {{was one of}} {{the most}} rail-oriented cities in Ireland, {{featuring}} eight stations at various times. The main route, still much the same today, is from Dublin Heuston. Originally terminating on the city's outskirts at Blackpool, the route now reaches the city centre terminus of Kent Station via Glanmire tunnel. Now a <b>through</b> <b>station,</b> the line through Kent connects the towns of Cobh and Midleton east of the city. This also connected to the seaside town of Youghal, until the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|From {{just before}} Asato <b>Station,</b> <b>through</b> Omoromachi <b>Station,</b> to shortly after Furujima Station, the {{monorail}} tracks run directly above, and following, Japan National Route 330 (Asato Bypass).|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} possible {{station for}} passengers consists {{of just a}} platform beside the track, with no points (US: switches) or sidings. Both terminal and <b>through</b> <b>stations</b> {{can be as simple}} as this; a junction requires at least one point.|$|R
25|$|Operationally, the 16 {{lines are}} divided into four groups of lines. The Clifton Hill Group {{comprises}} the two lines that branch at Clifton Hill station. The Burnley Group comprises the four lines that go <b>through</b> Burnley <b>station.</b> The Caulfield Group comprises the three lines that go <b>through</b> Caulfield <b>station,</b> plus the Sandringham line. The Northern Group comprises the remaining lines, which all go <b>through</b> North Melbourne <b>station.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1844 the Midland Counties Railway {{merged with}} two others into the Midland Railway. By 1848, {{the new company}} had outgrown Carrington Street station and new lines to Lincoln had been opened. A new <b>through</b> <b>station</b> was opened on the current station site on 22 May 1848, {{replacing}} the Carrington Street station. The station was designed by the architect J E Hall of Nottingham, and had its entrance on Station Street. In 1869 the Midland Railway purchased the West Croft Canal arm, filling it and building additional parallel tracks to south.|$|E
25|$|The PD line {{opened on}} 2 June 1890 and this changed Devonport into a <b>through</b> <b>station.</b> The new west-facing {{connection}} to Friary {{was brought into}} use on 1 April 1891. Trains to London now started from Friary, ran through Plymouth from east to west, called at North Road, and continued westwards through Devonport before heading north alongside the Tamar. They might have passed a GWR train for London running {{in the other direction}} through Plymouth; at Exeter this anomaly was repeated when they ran southwards from Cowley Bridge to St Davids, where GWR trains to London ran northwards.|$|E
25|$|London Bridge station {{remained}} the London terminus of the SER until 1864 when its station was again rebuilt. Five {{of the existing}} platforms were converted into a <b>through</b> <b>station</b> to enable {{the extension of the}} main line into central London and the opening of Charing Cross railway station, and in 1866 to Cannon Street station. In 1899 the SER entered into a working amalgamation with the London Chatham and Dover Railway (LC) to form the South Eastern and Chatham Railway Companies Joint Management Committee. Junctions were laid to enable trains through London Bridge to reach the LC stations at Holborn Viaduct and St Pauls.|$|E
