50|$|The {{management}} fee is paid by <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> to <b>the</b> management company or sponsor that organizes <b>the</b> <b>fund,</b> provides <b>the</b> portfolio management or {{investment advisory services}} and normally lends its brand to <b>the</b> <b>fund.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fund</b> manager may also provide other administrative services. The {{management fee}} often has breakpoints, which means that it declines as assets (in either <b>the</b> specific <b>fund</b> or in <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> family as a whole) increase. <b>The</b> <b>fund's</b> board reviews <b>the</b> management fee annually.

40|$|Term capital-guaranteed {{funds are}} managed {{so that the}} {{investor}} recovers at maturity their initial capital, <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> performance being related {{to the performance of}} financial markets. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate two types of <b>fund</b> management, namely <b>the</b> option method and the cushion method. In the first case, <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> manager statically hedges <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> using options. In the second case, <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> manager dynamically allocates the wealth following specific trading rules to insure <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> will fulfil <b>the</b> guarantee. For both types of management we describe the final value of <b>the</b> <b>fund,</b> we illustrate <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> behaviour for typical market evolutions and we study <b>the</b> distribution of <b>fund</b> values at maturity. Finally, we analyse the risk and performance characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> with various measures and discuss optimality. Our results may help fund managers to choose <b>the</b> adequate <b>fund</b> management method...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> International Monetary <b>Fund</b> (IMF), only a {{few years}} ago fading into obscurity in the {{thriving}} world economy, made a comeback during the 2008 - 2009 crisis. The G- 20 re-tasked <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> and tripled its lending capacity. Notwithstanding its new windfall and duties, <b>the</b> <b>Fund’s</b> le-gitimacy and effectiveness are in doubt. The main challenges center on disagreements between the Western European nations and emerging markets over <b>the</b> <b>Fund’s</b> governance and focus, a specter of disintegration of the global crisis management architecture by way of bilateral and regional fi-nancial arrangements (particularly in Asia), and limitations to <b>the</b> <b>Fund’s</b> responsiveness to major crises. Yet the threat of global financial instability persists, and <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> is uniquely qualified to counter it. The United States, <b>the</b> <b>Fund’s</b> founder and main shareholder, has sponsored sound reforms to <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> in <b>the</b> context of the G- 20. However, farther-reaching paradigmatic changes are required for <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> to effectively manage global economic instability in the 21 st century: focusing <b>the</b> <b>Fund’s</b> analytical powers squarely on systemic risks and largest economies rather than on small, developing nations; turning <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> from a crisis firefighter into a global preventive care unit that rewards members for sound policies; and making <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> a bridge between public and private insurance markets...|$|R
