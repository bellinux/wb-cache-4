Previous English encyclopedias had generally listed related terms separately in their alphabetical order, rather like a modern <b>technical</b> <b>dictionary,</b> an approach that the Britannica's management derided as [...] "dismembering the sciences".

2500|$|The first <b>technical</b> <b>dictionary</b> {{was drafted}} by John Harris and {{entitled}} [...] Harris’ book avoided theological and biographical entries; instead it concentrated on science and technology. Published in 1704, the Lexicon technicum was the first book to be written in English that took a methodical approach to describing mathematics and commercial arithmetic along with the physical sciences and navigation. Other technical dictionaries followed Harris’ model, including Ephraim Chambers’ Cyclopaedia (1728), which included five editions, and was a substantially larger work than Harris’. The folio edition of the work even included foldout engravings. The Cyclopaedia emphasized Newtonian theories, Lockean philosophy, and contained thorough examinations of technologies, such as engraving, brewing, and dyeing. [...] In Germany, practical reference works intended for the uneducated majority became popular in the 18th century. The Marperger Curieuses Natur-, Kunst-, Berg-, Gewerkund Handlungs-Lexicon (1712) explained terms that usefully described the trades and scientific and commercial education. Jablonksi Allgemeines Lexicon (1721) was better known than the Handlungs-Lexicon, and underscored technical subjects rather than scientific theory. For example, over five columns of text were dedicated to wine, while geometry and logic were allocated only twenty-two and seventeen lines, respectively. The first edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica (1771) was modelled {{along the same lines}} as the German lexicons.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Manual of Specialized Lexicographies a {{specialized}} dictionary, (also {{referred to as}} a <b>technical</b> <b>dictionary)</b> is a dictionary that focuses upon a specific subject field. Following the description, in The Bilingual LSP Dictionary, lexicographers categorize specialized dictionaries into three types. A multi-field dictionary broadly covers several subject fields (e.g. a business dictionary), a single-field dictionary narrowly covers one particular subject field (e.g. law), and a sub-field dictionary covers a more specialised field (e.g. constitutional law). For example, the 23-language Inter-Active Terminology for Europe is a multi-field dictionary, the American National Biography is a single-field, and the African American National Biography Project is a sub-field dictionary. In terms of the above coverage distinction between [...] "minimizing dictionaries" [...] and [...] "maximizing dictionaries", multi-field dictionaries tend to minimize coverage across subject fields (for instance, Oxford Dictionary of World Religions and Yadgar Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms) whereas single-field and sub-field dictionaries tend to maximize coverage within a limited subject field (The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology). A 'phonetic dictionary is one] that allows the reader to locate words by the [...] "way they sound", i.e. a dictionary that matches common or phonetic misspellings with the correct spelling of a word; such a dictionary uses pronunciation respelling to aid the search for or recognition of a word, and differs from a pronouncing dictionary, such as the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, which maps from a written word to its pronunciation in a chosen dialect.|$|E

The description of some scientific and technical dictionaries/glossaries affords an understanding of their diversity, which culminates in Diderot and D’Alembert’s Encyclopédie. The relationships between specialist knowledge and lexicographical description are illustrated through the dictionaries and glossaries, which are the repository of many applied sciences and technologies (e. g. Medieval Lapidaries, veritable sources of specialist nomenclatures; the glossary {{at the end of}} Bernard Palissy’s 1580 Treatises; scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>dictionaries</b> compiled by Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-century intellectuals, for example, Thomas Corneille’s important collection of terms, compiled in 1694, and Henry-Gabriel Duchesne’s 1776 Dictionnaire de L’industrie). This historical approach evidences two different modes of term collection: on the one hand, term collections were elaborated on the basis of specialist treatises and works; on the other hand, scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>dictionaries</b> were built on the basis of oral and written data, in order to fix the definition of concepts in the subject field at hand. This study wishes to demonstrate that every specialist lexicographical work, involving distinctive choices in terms of macro- and microstructure, is born and developed on the basis of precise specialist communication needs...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} common types of {{specialized}} dictionary is what is often referred to in English as a <b>technical</b> <b>dictionary</b> and in German as a Fachwörterbuch. These dictionaries cover the terminology of a particular subject field or discipline. As described in Nielsen (1994), dictionaries of this type can be classified in various ways. A dictionary that covers more than one subject field is called a multi-field dictionary; one that covers one subject field is called a single-field dictionary; and one that covers a limited part of a subject field is called a sub-field dictionary. A <b>technical</b> <b>dictionary</b> that attempts to cover as much of the relevant terminology as possible is called a maximizing dictionary, whereas one that attempts to cover only a limited part of the relevant terminology is called a minimizing dictionary.|$|E
