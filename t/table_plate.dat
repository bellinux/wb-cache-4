40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{focused on}} influences of the built and natural environment on {{mental and physical}} health. Three studies examined environmental attributes associated with {{mental and physical health}} within children's most proximate settings: homes, neighborhoods, and schools: Chapter 2 : Research about how residential design attributes may moderate effects of crowding on children's psychological health is sparse. This two-part, cross-sectional study first examined the relation between residential interior density and self-reported crowding among children. Second, analysis investigated the potential role of residential design attributes - floor plan arrangement, child's bedroom ceiling height, volume, and window area - to buffer adverse effects of crowding on children's psychological health and physiological stress. Results suggested that bedroom ceiling height may moderate negative effects of home and bedroom crowding on children's psychological health and physiological stress. Chapter 3 : The amount of nature needed for humans to achieve the welldocumented benefits of nature exposure is unknown, partially because no common nature measure exists. This study developed and tested a nature estimation method, using freely available Google Earth satellite images, to address estimation limitations of 2006 National Land Cover Database and automated Geographic Information Systems procedures. Amounts of nature (vegetation, trees, water) surrounding a sample of New York residences were estimated and compared using both methods. The Google Earth method better estimated nearby nature in dense, highly developed urban areas, while either estimation method was appropriate for less densely populated areas. Chapter 4 : Based on environmental psychology and behavioral economics strategies associated with healthy eating, the Cafeteria Assessment for Elementary Schools (CAFES) offers an objective, reliable, and valid instrument that quantifies physical cafeteria attributes linked to selection and consumption of fruits and vegetables (FV) at the scale of room, <b>table,</b> <b>plate,</b> and food. Observations, interviews, and FV serving and consumption data obtained from lunch tray photography were used to develop and validate CAFES. Total CAFES and four scale scores were associated with FV consumption outcomes. Researchers and practitioners can use CAFES to identify critical areas for intervention; suggest low- and nocost intervention strategies; and contribute to design guidelines aimed at promoting healthy eating among elementary school students. 2018 - 05 - 2...|$|E
40|$|Shock {{is one of}} the {{environmental}} tests that a spacecraft must pass before being cleared for launch. Shock testing poses a challenging data acquisition issue and careful selection of equipment is crucial to creating a successful shock test facility. Cal Poly’s CubeSat programs can currently perform all environmental testing other than shock themselves, so a quality shock table would be useful. Previous groups of students had developed a shock table, and this paper details the improvement and characterization of that shock table’s behavior. Several adjustable parameters were tested and documented to discover trends in the shock table’s response to an impact from a pendulum hammer. Then a test meant to mimic an actual shock test was performed. The CubeSat program provided a component to be tested and a requirement to be met. The nominal requirement is proprietary and cannot be given here, and additional stipulations included the test data being within a given tolerance band and at least 50 % of the test data having a larger magnitude than the nominal requirement. The requirement needed to be met in all three of the component’s axes. The component was mounted to the shock table and acceleration data was collected and analyzed. A successful test was conducted in one axis, which was the result of impacting the large face of the aluminum shock <b>table</b> <b>plate.</b> The tests in the other two axes, conducted with impacts {{to the side of the}} aluminum plate, failed to meet the requirement. A finite element model of the table was developed and correlated to the test data. A new way of attaching the test component to the table was developed that would allow for testing in all three axes to be performed with impacts to the large face of the aluminum plate. A dynamic finite element analysis was performed, and the results indicate that this new attachment method should allow the requirement to be met in all three axes. The shock table is currently fully operational and can be used for testing and teaching purposes. With the implementation of the new attachment method, it is believed that the CubeSat program’s requirements can be met as well...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} The {{first publication}} in which aspects of plural formation in VGT were explored, {{was written by}} Van Herreweghe (1995). Vermeerbergen (1997) also discussed certain aspects of plural formation in VGT. These studies found certain mechanisms for plural formation, i. e. : (1) the repetition of (a movement of) a sign; (2) the use of numbers; (3) the use of quantifiers; (4) the use of classifiers and (5) double articulation. However, these studies do not present {{a detailed description of}} each mechanism and they do not discuss which (types of) signs get which plural form. Moreover, they are not based on an analysis of extensive corpus data. Research questions It was therefore considered necessary to set up a more detailed research project analysing a larger, but targeted, corpus. The following research questions were defined: 1. Which are the possible forms of plural formation of noun signs in VGT? 2. Is there a one-to-one relation between singular and plural forms of noun signs and/or do particular noun signs have different possible plurals? 3. If a singular noun can take various forms of pluralisation, which form is the preferred one in which context? 4. Are certain plural forms obligatory in certain contexts? Research methodology Plural formation has been dealt with in detail {{in a number of other}} sign languages, i. e. in German Sign Language (DGS) by Pfau & Steinbach (2006), in Sign Language of the Netherlands (NGT) by Nijhoff & Zwitserlood (1999) and Harder, Koolhof & Schermer (2003) and in Turkish Sign Language (TID) by Kubuș (2008). Based on these studies we developed our methodology and decided to work with elicitation materials consisting of pictures and videos without any interference of a spoken or written language. In total, 39 objects were selected and for each object four pictures were shown to the informants, bringing the total to 156 pictures in which: - one object is displayed - two objects are displayed - a countable number of objects is displayed - an non-countable number of objects is displayed Three of the objects in the pictures were also elicited by means of films as we wanted to elicit data by means of both static and dynamic materials. The informants had to meet as many of the following criteria as possible: - early acquisition of VGT - education in a deaf school (at least at primary school level) - daily usage of VGT (e. g. with parents, with partner, in the family, at work) - active membership of the Flemish Deaf community. All data collection, i. e. the recordings, was conducted by a deaf researcher. Results and discussion At the moment, data of three signers from each of the five Flemish provinces have been analysed. This has yielded the following (preliminary) results. Plural formation can clearly be expressed in different ways: 1. The citation form of the sign is changed so as to express plurality: a. By changing the manual part of the sign i. by means of double articulation (i. e. a one-handed sign is produced with both hands) ii. by means of reduplication (i. e. the sign or the movement component of the sign is produced more than once) b. By changing the non-manual part of the sign (mostly the spoken component which then refers to the plural form of the corresponding spoken Dutch word); 2. A sign is added (in various possible orders to be discussed during the paper presentation), i. e. a. A lexical sign from the established VGT lexicon i. A number (TWO, THREE, etc) e. g. TWO FLOWER IN VASE ii. Another quantifier (MANY, SOME, etc.) e. g. MANY BICYCLE STAY STATION TO-PARK IN STATION iii. A collective sign (e. g. GROUP, ROW, etc.) e. g. FAR GROUP BIRD FLY b. A non-established sign from the productive lexicon i. A classifier construction (entity and handling classifiers) e. g. ON <b>TABLE</b> <b>PLATE</b> “plates-in-a-mess-on-table" ii. A non- established collective sign e. g. STONE “pile" c. Pointing signs e. g. COW INDEX “there"++++ 3. Certain signs have plural meaning i. The default meaning is plural and morphologically the sign goes back to the repetition of the related singular sign. e. g. CHILDREN, PEOPLE, CLOTHES, FORREST etc. ii. The default meaning is plural e. g. CHIPS Besides these there also seem to be certain implicit mechanisms to express plurality. Moreover, usually the above-mentioned mechanisms were combined according to certain tendencies. Examples will be provided during the paper presentation. status: publishe...|$|E

Ficus benjamina-Pouteria oborata community. (<b>Table</b> 4) (<b>Plate</b> 3. C, Plate 4. A-C) This community forms a bushland of evergreen shrub and small trees with windswept and often interlaced crown. Shrub layer is dominated by the species Ficus benjamina, Pouteria obovata, Diospyros maritina, Morus australis, Macaranga tanarius and Litsea japonica, herb layer is dominated Neottopteris antique. 4. Scaevola frutescens-Messerschimidia argentea community (<b>Table</b> 5) (<b>Plate</b> 5, A) This community occurs behind the rock pavement vegetation. The classification of this community was done according to the following species: Scaevola frutescens, Messerschmidia argentea, Crinum asiaticum var. japonicum and Raphanus acanthfiormis f. rapanistroides. 5. Lotus australis-Thuarea inroluta community (Table 6) This community occurs on the sand behind the raised coral leaf. The dominant species in this community is Lysimachia mauritiana, Lotus australis and Thrarea involuta. 6. Limestone rock pavement vegetation a. Philoxerus wrightii community (Table 10) This vegetation occurs immediately behind the splash zone, and is dominated by only Philoxerus wrightii which is often prostrate. b. Permphis acidula community (<b>Table</b> 9) (<b>Plate</b> 5. A, Plate 6. A) This vegetation occurs behind the philoxerus wrightii community, and its extent varies to the width and degree of exposure of the terrace. The dominant species in this community is Pemphis acidula, which is stunted between 10 cm and 30 cm in height. C. Peucedanum japonicum community (<b>Table</b> 8) (<b>Plate</b> 5.
