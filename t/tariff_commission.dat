25|$|From its inception, the Peruvian {{electricity}} system {{started to}} be developed by private initiative. In 1955, Law No. 12378 regulated the mechanisms of private participation, establishing a system of concessions with commitments to increase generation capacity by 10% annually. The National <b>Tariff</b> <b>Commission</b> and other mechanisms aiming at guaranteeing the profitability of the investments were then created. However, {{at the beginning of}} the 1970s, profound changes took place. In 1972, the de facto military government nationalized the electricity industry through Law No.19521, creating ELECTROPERU (Peru Electricity Company). ELECTROPERU became the owner of all the generation, transmission and distribution assets and came to be in charge of service provision and investment planning. Until the beginning of the 1980s there were large investments in hydroelectric and thermal projects. However, this dynamism started to fade during the 1980s mainly due to the debt crisis that started in 1982 and that precluded new financing in the region. By the beginning of the 1990s, the electricity sector in Peru showed an important deterioration due to low investment in infrastructure, the fact that tariffs did not cover production costs, the restricted investment in maintenance and the systematic destruction of infrastructures by terrorist activities. The results of this crisis were severe: in 1990 only 45% of the population had access to electricity, supply only covered 74% of the demand and distribution losses were above 20%.|$|E

40|$|During {{much of the}} {{previous}} era of globalization, from the 1860 s until the First World War, U. S. tariffs were surprisingly high. Present-day economic historians have suggested that U.

They have also argued that the backlash holds a lesson for the present: specifically, that we must attend to the distributive inequities that globalization engenders, or else globalization will again plant the seeds of its own destruction. I show that U. S. tariffs were not the product of backlash. A history of economic ideas in the nineteenth century United States, centered on two <b>tariff</b> <b>commissions</b> in 1866 - 1870 and 1882, reveals that the ideas debated in intellectual and policy circles alike bore no trace of globalization backlash. The important feature of U. S. intellectual and tariff policy history is not globalization backlash, but rather the absence from most historical accounts of certain thinkers and ideas that were crucial to the debate. Accordingly, the lesson that history holds for the present is not that we must attend to globalization`s inequities. (That lesson is likely to stand or fall apart from history.) Instead it is that we need to attend to the /idea/ of backlash, which has a foothold in history that is deeper than the evidence. The lesson implies that to understand the present and future of globalization, what are required are histories of ideas...|$|R

[...] This variety includes Clear Material, for jewelry, smokers' articles, etc.; cement, using in sealing electric light bulbs in metal bases; varnishes, for impregnating electric coils, etc.; lacquers, for protecting the surface of hardware; enamels, for giving resistive coating to industrial equipment; Laminated Bakelite, used for silent gears and insulation; and molding material, from which are formed innumerable articles of utility and beauty. [...] The Molding Material is prepared ordinarily by the impregnation of cellulose substances with the initial 'uncured' resin."

40|$|In {{spite of}} massive foreign {{economic}} aid to countries in South Asia and {{their efforts to}} improve their export earnings through export subsidies, there persists an uncertainty regarding the quantity of annual aid. This, together with instability in their export earnings, has affected the economic performance {{of the countries in}} the region. Even the protective tariff policies of these countries act as an obstacle in utilizing available technology and resources efficiently. The United Nations Conferences on Trade and Development emphasize on increased trade among developing countries. An establishment of a common market or any other form of economic groupings will encourage trade and economic co-operation between the countries of South Asia in particular and developing countries in general. Economists like Tinbergen has visualized a possibility of an integrated market between countries of Indian subcontinent. This study attempts to explore such a possibility. The study, being explorative, is certainly conjuctural in nature. Yet an attempt has been made to demonstrate that if a regional economic grouping is worked out between countries of South Asia, it will through trade creation and trade diverting effects, succeed in realizing the following: 1. The area as a whole, through trade among countries of the area, is likely to attain self-sufficiency in foodgrains. This will, in itself, impart momentum to economic development in the region. 2. The extended size of the market will provide a better opportunity for utilizing modern methods of production. The exploitation of complimentarities in industrial production will result in a better utilization of available irreproducible resources of the region. Such complimentarities could be explored in petroleum refining, petro-chemical, fertilizer production, packaging, and agriculture. 3. Such an effort demands an intensive study of the existing policies. This should be undertaken through the establishment of regional planning and regional trade and <b>tariff</b> <b>commissions.</b> 4. This study emphasizes that a removal of tariffs, on trade between these countries and acceptance of a common agreed tariff on imports from non-member countries, will act as an incentive for rapid agricultural and industrial development in the region...|$|R

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{reliance}} on large health care data bases, {{the need to}} verify data quality increases as well. Because of the considerable costs involved in checks using primary data collection, a computerized methodology for performing such checks is suggested. The technique seems appropriate for any situation where two data collection systems (i. e. hospital discharge abstracts and physician claims for payment) relate to the same event, such as a patient's hospitalization. After reviewing other approaches, this paper suggests linking physician claims for performing particular surgical procedures with hospital discharge abstracts for the stay in which the surgery took place. Physician and hospital data for adults age 25 and over in Manitoba from 1 April, 1979 to 31 March, 1984 were used to address the questions: 1. 1. How well can the two data sets be linked? 2. 2. Given linkage of the two data sets, how much agreement is there as to procedure and diagnosis? Linkage between hospital and physician data was excellent (over 95 %) for 5 out of 11 surgical procedures (hysterectomy, prostatectomy, total hip replacement, coronary artery bypass surgery, and heart valve replacement); there was over 90 % perfect agreement for three other procedures (cholecystectomy, cataract surgery and total knee replacement).
