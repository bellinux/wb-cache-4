5|$|An {{important}} factor in the unification process was the Polish Church, which remained a single ecclesiastical province throughout the fragmentation period. Archbishop Jakub Świnka of Gniezno was an ardent proponent of Poland's reunification; he performed <b>the</b> <b>crowning</b> ceremonies for both Przemysł II and Wenceslaus II. Świnka supported Władysław I Łokietek at various stages of the duke's career.|$|E

In February 2009, Universal launched a website for the attraction, which included a construction blog and photographs chronicling progress of the attraction's construction. The track layout was completed at the end of April 2009 with <b>the</b> <b>crowning</b> of the lift hill.|$|E
5|$|Designed by architects Phillip Hudson and James Wardrop {{who were}} both World War I veterans, the Shrine is in a {{classical}} style, being {{based on the}} Tomb of Mausolus at Halicarnassus and the Parthenon in Athens. <b>The</b> <b>crowning</b> element {{at the top of}} the memorial's ziggurat roof references the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Crown</b> Prince of Japan is {{also served}} by a chamberlain. This {{official}} is called East Palace Chamberlain (Tōgū-jijū) in Japanese because <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> Prince lives in the East Palace (and <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> Prince was also called Tōgū).

5|$|In the meantime, Romeo and Juliet {{was finally}} staged by the Kirov Ballet, choreographed by Leonid Lavrovsky, on 11 January 1940. To the {{surprise}} of all of its participants, the dancers having struggled {{to cope with the}} music's syncopated rhythms and almost having boycotted the production, the ballet was an instant success, and became recognised as <b>the</b> <b>crowning</b> achievement of Soviet dramatic ballet.|$|E
5|$|Much {{more than}} a {{renovation}} project, Domitian's building program {{was intended to be}} <b>the</b> <b>crowning</b> achievement of an Empire-wide cultural renaissance. Around fifty structures were erected, restored or completed, achievements second only to those of Augustus. Among the most important new structures were an odeon, a stadium, and an expansive palace on the Palatine Hill known as the Flavian Palace, which was designed by Domitian's master architect Rabirius.|$|E
5|$|Robe Royal or Pallium Regale – {{the main}} robe worn during the {{ceremony}} and used during <b>the</b> <b>crowning.</b> It is a four-square mantle, lined in crimson silk {{and decorated with}} silver coronets, national symbols and silver imperial eagles in the four corners. It is lay, rather than liturgical, in nature.|$|E

5000|$|The {{thickness}} of <b>the</b> <b>crown</b> and <b>the</b> average <b>crown</b> spread will be measured and <b>the</b> general <b>crown</b> shape of <b>the</b> tree {{will be determined}} by visual comparison with a chart. <b>The</b> <b>crown</b> shape will be used to derive a crown form (CF) value for different tree shapes and will be the third parameter of <b>the</b> <b>crown</b> volume calculation formula. <b>The</b> <b>crown</b> of a tree can be subdivided into 10 disks each representing 1/10 of the height of <b>the</b> <b>crown.</b> <b>The</b> diameter of each disk can be expressed as some fraction of <b>the</b> average <b>crown</b> spread. Whether <b>the</b> tree is taller and each disk represents a greater length of <b>the</b> <b>crown,</b> or if <b>the</b> <b>crown</b> spread is larger or smaller, each disk will represent the same fraction of the total volume of <b>the</b> <b>crown.</b> Consider that there must be a single cylinder of the same height as <b>the</b> <b>crown</b> thickness that has the same volume as <b>the</b> irregularly shaped <b>crown.</b> <b>The</b> problem then becomes one of determining the diameter of this cylinder so that its volume equals that of <b>the</b> <b>crown</b> of <b>the</b> tree.

5|$|During royal coronations, however, {{separate}} banners {{for each}} of the two constituent nations of the Commonwealth were still used. Crown (i.e., Polish) and Lithuanian standard-bearers carried the furled banners in a procession to the royal cathedral where, shortly after the anointment and just before <b>the</b> <b>crowning</b> of the king-elect, they handed the banners to the primate who unfurled them and handed them to the kneeling king. The king would then stand up and give the unfurled banners back to the standard-bearers.|$|E
5|$|In 1860 Matejko {{published}} an illustrated album, Clothing in Poland (Ubiory w Polsce), a project reflecting his intense interest in historical records {{of all kinds}} and his desire to promote such interest among Polish people, to intensify their patriotism. His financial situation improved when he sold two paintings, Death of Wapowski during <b>the</b> <b>crowning</b> of Henry Valois (Zabicie Wapowskiego w czasie koronacji Henryka Walezego, 1861) and Jan Kochanowski mourning his daughter Urszulka (Jan Kochanowski nad zwłokami Urszulki, 1862), which settled his debts.|$|E
5|$|The Celebration was {{conceived}} by Henry Davis, a horse trainer {{who along with}} several other horsemen, felt the Shelbyville area should have a festival or annual event. Although the Celebration was originally held in Wartrace, Tennessee, it moved to Shelbyville, the seat of Bedford County, a few years later. The Celebration spans 11 days and nights in late August and early September annually, and finishes with <b>the</b> <b>crowning</b> of the World Grand Champion Tennessee Walker on the Saturday night before Labor Day. The TWHNC draws an estimated 2,000 horses and 250,000 spectators to Shelbyville each year.|$|E

5|$|The {{front side}} of the left wing shows the Agony in the Garden and the Flagellation of Christ. The front {{side of the}} central wing {{represents}} the Crucifixion of Jesus with Saint Catherine and Saint Ursula. These two female figures may have been painted last {{as they are in}} a more distinctly Proto-Renaissance style than the rest. The front side of the right wing represents <b>the</b> <b>Crowning</b> with thorns and the Bearing of the Cross, all from the Passion of Jesus.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{commissioned}} {{into the}} Austro-Hungarian Navy, the three ships of the Monarch class {{were used for}} a variety of purposes. All three ships of the Monarch class partook in a cruise around the Adriatic and Aegean in 1899, to display the Austro-Hungarian flag in foreign waters. The Monarch class formed the I Battleship Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The battleship Wien participated in the Diamond Jubilee of <b>the</b> <b>crowning</b> of Queen Victoria in 1897, as well as the international blockade off Crete during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897.|$|E
5|$|A three-year {{civil war}} {{followed}} his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers {{was created for}} Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with <b>the</b> <b>crowning</b> of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) as king. In the eastern lands the dynasty had died out earlier, in 911, {{with the death of}} Louis the Child, and the selection of the unrelated Conrad I (r. 911–918) as king.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Five <b>Crowns,</b> {{also known}} as <b>the</b> Five Heavenly <b>Crowns,</b> is a concept in Christian {{theology}} that pertains to <b>the</b> five <b>crowns</b> that individuals can receive after the Last Judgment. These are <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> of Life, <b>the</b> Incorruptible <b>Crown,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> of Righteousness, <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> of Glory, and <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> of Exultation. In the Greek language, stephanos (στέφανος) is <b>the</b> word for <b>crown</b> and is translated as such in the Bible, especially in versions descending from the King James Version. These five rewards can be earned by believers, according to the New Testament, as [...] "rewards for faithfulness in this life".|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Crown</b> of Rus, {{also known}} as <b>the</b> <b>Crown</b> of Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia, is <b>the</b> <b>crown</b> with which Daniel of Galicia was crowned in 1253 by a papal {{archbishop}} in Drohiczyn.|$|R

5|$|Arthur {{was served}} by sons of English, Irish and Welsh nobility, such as Gearoid Óg FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare, {{who had been}} brought to the English court as a {{consequence}} of the involvement of his father, Gerald Fitzgerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, in <b>the</b> <b>crowning</b> of pretender Lambert Simnel in Ireland during Henry VII's reign. Other servants were Anthony Willoughby, a son of Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke, Robert Radcliffe, the heir of the 9th Baron FitzWalter and Maurice St John, a favourite nephew of Arthur's grandmother Lady Margaret Beaufort. He was brought up with Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas, the son of powerful Welsh nobleman Thomas ap Rhys, Gruffydd grow quite close to Arthur and was buried in Worcester Cathedral upon his death in 1521, alongside the Prince's tomb.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{unsuccessful}} ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336BC, the orator Ctesiphon {{proposed that}} Athens honour Demosthenes {{for his services}} to the city by presenting him, according to custom, with a golden crown. This proposal became a political issue and, in 330BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant speech, On the Crown, Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and vehemently attacked those who would have preferred peace with Macedon. He was unrepentant about his past actions and policies and insisted that, when in power, the constant aim of his policies was the honour and the ascendancy of his country; and on every occasion and in all business he preserved his loyalty to Athens. He finally defeated Aeschines, although his enemy's objections to <b>the</b> <b>crowning</b> were arguably valid from a legal point of view.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Eric Morley {{organized}} the Festival Bikini Contest, a beauty contest and swimwear advertising opportunity at that year's Festival of Britain. The press, welcoming the spectacle, {{referred to it}} as Miss World, a name Morley registered as a trademark. The winner was Kiki Håkansson of Sweden, who was crowned in a bikini. After <b>the</b> <b>crowning,</b> Håkansson was condemned by Pope Pius XII, while Spain and Ireland threatened to withdraw from the pageant. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced by evening gowns. As a result of the controversy, the bikini was explicitly banned from many other beauty pageants worldwide. Though some regarded the bikini and beauty contests as bringing freedom to women, they were opposed by some feminists as well as religious and cultural groups who objected to the degree of exposure of the female body.|$|E

5|$|In August 1968, the Polish People's Army {{took part}} in the Warsaw Pact {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia. Some Polish intellectuals protested, and Ryszard Siwiec burned himself alive during the official national holiday celebrations. The Polish participation in the crushing of the Czech liberal communism (called socialism with a human face, and, according to David Ost, constituting <b>the</b> <b>crowning</b> achievement of Marxist revisionism) further alienated Gomułka from his former liberal supporters. But within the party, the opposition to Gomułka faded and the 5th Congress of the PZPR in November reconfirmed his rule. Brezhnev, who attended the gathering, used the occasion to expound his Brezhnev Doctrine, a self-granted Soviet right to forcefully intervene if an allied state strays too far from the fraternal course.|$|E
5|$|Male sovereigns {{up to and}} {{including}} George VI have traditionally worn a crimson cap of maintenance for the opening procession and when seated in the Chair of Estate during {{the first part of the}} service. Female sovereigns wear the George IV State Diadem, also worn by its namesake, George IV. For the Anointing, the sovereign is bareheaded, and remains so until <b>the</b> <b>Crowning.</b> Monarchs are usually crowned with St Edward's Crown but some have chosen to use other crowns because it weighs 2.23kg (4.9lb). For the final part of the service, and the processions that follow, it is exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{above the}} rank of {{minister}} are allowed to fly the flag at their residence provided they do not live near the capital.

The only flag day prescribed in the 1972 rules is National Day, which is held annually on December 17.
