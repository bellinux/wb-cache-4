5|$|Convoys from Britain {{lacked the}} surface vessel escort after 13°W. Hudsons could only make sweeps up to 17°W but lacked {{endurance}} <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>there.</b> From Gibraltar, {{the lack of}} flying boats meant a lack of air cover after 100 miles. Nevertheless, great efforts were made with limited resources to provide cover from first to last light, the time when U-boats could use the rising and setting sun to see the silhouettes on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 {{declaration}} by Russia that {{it would}} stay in DST all year long was subsequently followed by a similar declaration from Belarus. Russia's plan generated widespread complaints due to the dark of wintertime morning, and thus was abandoned in 2014. The country changed its clocks to Standard Time on October 26, 2014 and intends <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>there</b> permanently.|$|E
5|$|After being {{dismissed}} as the Redskins' coach, Graham {{returned to the}} Coast Guard Academy as athletic director and said he planned <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>there</b> until he retired. He coached the college team in the College All-Star Game in 1970 for his tenth and final time. The college stars lost for the seventh time in a row that year, falling 24–3 to the Kansas City Chiefs. He was replaced in 1971 by Blanton Collier, who had retired after succeeding Brown as Cleveland's head coach.|$|E

5|$|Isle Verde, where {{approximately}} 2,300people were killed, {{was declared}} uninhabitable by officials; however, residents still {{returned to the}} area due to a need for land. Eventually, signs that used to warn people not {{to stay on the}} islet were eventually taken down and people were no longer warned not to live there. A resettlement community was constructed months later, with plans to house 912 of the 2,668families that needed to be moved from the area. Those that were not moved were left on Isle Verde despite orders not <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>there.</b> Another resettlement project for 700families was planned at the cost of $1million.|$|E
5|$|More than 600 archeological {{sites have}} been found inside the {{boundaries}} of Petrified Forest National Park. Evidence suggests that the earliest inhabitants of the park arrived at least 8,000 years ago. Two Folsom-type spear points, the earliest artifacts of Paleo-Indians found in the park, are at least that old. Between 6000BCE and 1CE, the Archaic–Early Basketmaker Era, nomadic groups established seasonal camps in the Petrified Forest from which they hunted small game such as rabbits, pronghorn antelope, and deer and harvested seeds from Indian ricegrass and other wild plants. Around 150BCE, they began to grow corn in the area. By 1CE, as their farming techniques improved, some built houses in the Petrified Forest and began <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>there</b> year-round.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of Chinnamaya, Lambu and Jambu, Ghatotkacha creates a magical town {{consisting}} of an illusory marketplace and palace. He names the town Mayabazar and invites the Kauravas <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>there.</b> Chinnamaya, Lambu and Jamu introduce themselves to the Kauravas as servants appointed by Balarama to look after them. They manage to trick Sarma and Sastry, Shakuni's lackeys. Ghatotkacha (in Sasirekha's form) makes Duryodhana's wife rethink the marriage arrangement and teases Lakshmana Kumara. He plans the wedding of the real Sasirekha and Abhimanyu in his hermitage which is attended by Krishna. Using his divine powers, Krishna also attends as a guest for the marriage {{taking place in the}} Mayabazar.|$|E

5|$|Wright told Lee {{that it was}} {{relatively}} easy {{to get to the}} crest, but it was difficult <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>there.</b> A significant reason Wright could not stay was his lack of support. Two brigades were on Wright's left and could have reinforced his success. Carnot Posey's brigade made slow progress and never crossed the Emmitsburg Road, despite protestations from Wright. William Mahone's brigade inexplicably never moved at all. Gen. Anderson sent a messenger with orders to Mahone to advance, but Mahone refused. Part of the blame for the failure of Wright's assault must lie with Anderson, who took little active part in directing his division in battle.|$|E
5|$|Carr Gomm {{contacted}} {{other institutions}} and hospitals {{more suited to}} caring for chronic cases, but none would accept Merrick. Gomm {{wrote a letter to}} The Times, printed on 4 December, outlining Merrick's case and asking readers for suggestions. The public response—in letters and donations—was significant, and the situation was even covered by the British Medical Journal. With the financial backing of the many donors, Gomm was able to make a convincing case to the committee for keeping Merrick in the hospital. It was decided that he would be allowed <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>there</b> for the remainder of his life. He was moved from the attic to two rooms in the basement adjacent to a small courtyard. The rooms were adapted and furnished to suit Merrick, with a specially constructed bed and—at Treves's instruction—no mirrors.|$|E
5|$|On , 1896 the leaking Sissoi Veliky reached Algiers. The captain planned <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>there</b> for {{at least}} 20 days to {{complete}} the most urgent repairs, but five days later a telegram from Saint Petersburg forced him to leave for Piraeus. There the crew managed to seal the seams between the armour plates and repair the electrical systems. In February 1897 Sissoi Veliky steamed for Crete and she had her first gunnery exercise ten miles off the shore of Souda Bay, Crete {{at the end of}} the month. The second exercise, held on , ended in disaster when the rear turret exploded after an hour of target practice. The explosion blew the roof of the turret over the mainmast so that it struck the base of the foremast, crushing one 37mm gun and a steam cutter. The explosion killed 16 men and wounded another 15; 6 of these later died of their wounds. The badly damaged Sissoi Veliky headed to Toulon for repairs.|$|E

5|$|The prisoners' {{day began}} at 4:30 am (an hour later in winter) with morning roll call. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli {{describes}} roll call as beginning 03:00 and lasting four hours. The weather was cold in Auschwitz {{at that time}} of day, even in summer. The prisoners were ordered to line up outdoors in rows of five and had <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>there</b> until 07:00, when the SS officers arrived. Meanwhile, the guards would force the prisoners to squat for an hour with their hands above their heads or levy punishments such as beatings or detention for infractions such as having a missing button or an improperly cleaned food bowl. The inmates were counted and re-counted. Nyiszli describes how even the dead had to be present at roll call, standing supported by their fellow inmates until the ordeal was over. When he was a prisoner in 1944–45, five to ten men were found dead in the barracks each night. The prisoners assigned to Mengele's staff slept in a separate barracks and were awoken at 07:00 for a roll call that only took a few minutes.|$|E
5|$|Two villages {{situated}} on the southern boundary were shifted to the Firozpur–Manpur area {{situated on}} Ramnagar–Kashipur highway during 1990–93; the vacated areas were designated as buffer zones. The families in these villages were mostly dependent on forest products. With the passage of time, these areas began {{to show signs of}} ecological recovery. Vines, herbs, grasses and small trees began to appear, followed by herbaceous flora, eventually leading to natural forest type. It was observed that grass began to grow on the vacated agricultural fields and the adjoining forest areas started recuperating. By 1999–2002 several plant species emerged in these buffer zones. The newly arisen lush green fields attracted grass eating animals, mainly deer and elephants, who slowly migrated towards these areas and even preferred <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>there</b> throughout the monsoon.|$|E
5|$|After {{shooting}} Magruder {{and killing}} Arnaud, Logan then fled {{the scene with}} Kromah in a silver-painted Dodge Charger with Maryland license plates, with Kromah driving the vehicle. After leaving the house, Kromah took the weapon from Logan and attempted to wipe off any residual evidence, such as fingerprints, from it. The two then disposed of the murder weapon by burying it at a nearby forested cemetery and abandoned the getaway vehicle. Kromah was captured and charged as an accomplice to the murder; he pleaded guilty on April 24, 2003 to being an accessory after the fact to a murder. In the meantime, Logan stayed briefly at the residence of Twyla James, a woman who lived in Largo, Maryland. James would later be arrested and charged as an accessory to murder as she transported Logan, whom she had known was a murder suspect and fugitive sought by legal authorities, to her residence and allowed him <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>there.</b> Logan was apprehended {{two days after the}} murder, on August 31, 2002, at a shed near the Quebec Arms Apartments in Hyattsville, Maryland, on the 8200 block of 14th Avenue. He was spotted there by undercover policemen, who had received information that it had been an area that Logan was known to frequent in the past. Logan was found hiding in the shed by policemen, who then used a police canine and a taser to subdue and apprehend him.|$|E
