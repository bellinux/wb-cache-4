However, the first International meeting in 1987 was the initial round of the Intercontinental F3000 Championship on 12 April. The race was run at 103.96mph, the winner being Maurício Gugelmin in a Ralt from Michel Trollé in a Lola and Roberto Moreno aboard another Ralt.|$|E

Heng hoped that the LGBT community would relate to the plays which included 'insider' jokes and references that could only be fully appreciated by the gay community, with scripts that were not dumbed down to accommodate a straight audience. Owing to its lesbian theme, the producers experienced great difficulty in securing a corporate sponsor.|$|E

25|$|Waugh {{began the}} Ashes series with centuries in the First Test at Brisbane (112) and the Third Test at Melbourne but was criticised for taking singles {{off the first}} ball of the over, and exposing the {{tail-end}} batsmen to the strike. Stuart MacGill and Glenn McGrath fell to Darren Gough after one such instance as Australia collapsed in the second innings whilst chasing a small target. This criticism could be considered more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> unfair, however, given his strong record overall of batting well with lower order batsman such as Merv Hughes, Jason Gillespie, Ian Healy, Shane Warne and even Glenn McGrath precisely by putting his faith in them. In the Fifth Test of the season, Waugh {{was involved in a}} century partnership with brother Mark for the second consecutive year. Again however, he fell within sight of triple figures for 96, while his brother reached his century. Australia won the Test and the series 3–1.|$|E
25|$|The Reims Campaign, {{following}} which {{peace was}} finally achieved with the Treaty of Brétigny. But, {{on the same}} terms, England was left with {{about a third of}} France rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> under half which they would have received through the Treaty of London. This is due to the failure to take Reims which led to the need for a safe passage out of France. As a result, a lesser treaty was agreed to and Edward III was obliged to drop his claims to the French throne. France was still forced to pay a huge ransom of around four times France's gross annual domestic product for John the Good. The ransom paid was, however, a little short of that demanded by the English, and John the Good was not returned to the French. Thus, this campaign yielded mixed results, but was mostly positive for Edward. One must also remember Edward III never actually dropped his claim to the throne, and that about half of France was controlled by the English anyway through many vassals.|$|E

Ashley Lee from The Hollywood Reporter said that the show's venue was [...] "intima", and that Trainor took advantage of this.

500|$|In the episode's {{original}} plot, Dupre was to {{have jumped}} into Mulder's body. There was, however, a belief {{at the time that}} neither Scully nor Mulder should directly experience such phenomena; Fox and the studio argued against the idea of using Mulder in such a way. With more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> reluctance, the producers agreed to make the change. As writer Howard Gordon later recalled, [...] "We'd wanted Mulder to experience the soul switch". Eventually, however, Fox's stance was changed; most notably, in the two-part sixth season episode, [...] "Dreamland", when Mulder's consciousness is exchanged with government agent Morris Fletcher. Gordon ultimately came to believe that the final decision was almost certainly for the best and saw the benefit of introducing Scully's former boyfriend as it provided a welcome opportunity to delve into her history.|$|E
500|$|In 1940, Barrymore {{appeared}} in The Great Profile, a spoof {{of his life}} in the months prior to My Dear Children. Barrymore played Evans Garrick, closely modeled on his own experience, and Mary Beth Hughes played his wife. The critics reacted harshly to the film, and to Barrymore's association with it. The New York Times wrote that [...] "As a play it is a feeble thing, hardly matching the spectacular public accounts of his amours... for all of Mr. Barrymore's shenanigans and devastating wit, The Great Profile is more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pathetic. In the Winter of his Discontent Mr. Barrymore is selling his talent at cut-rate". In terms of his reputation, worse was to come in his final film, Playmates (1941), which [...] "amply illustrated the depths to which he had fallen; he played an alcoholic Shakespearean ham named John Barrymore".|$|E

500|$|The New York Times {{film critic}} Bosley Crowther noted {{the film was}} a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves. The Beatles are portrayed as likeable young lads who are {{constantly}} amazed at the attention they receive and who want nothing more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> peace and quiet; however, {{they have to deal}} with screaming crowds, journalists who ask nonsensical questions, and authority figures who constantly look down upon them. In fact their biggest problem is McCartney's elderly, but [...] "clean" [...] grandfather, played by Wilfrid Brambell. The New Yorker critic Brendan Gill wrote: [...] "Though I don't pretend to understand what makes these four rather odd-looking boys so fascinating to so many scores of millions of people, I admit that I feel a certain mindless joy stealing over me as they caper about uttering sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|The two symphonies divide opinion {{even more}} sharply. Mason rates the Second poorly for its [...] "over-obvious rhythmic scheme", but calls the First [...] "Elgar's masterpiece. ... It {{is hard to}} see how any candid student can deny the greatness of this symphony." [...] However, in the 1957 centenary symposium, several leading admirers of Elgar express {{reservations}} about one or both symphonies. In the same year, Roger Fiske wrote in The Gramophone, [...] "For some reason few people seem to like the two Elgar symphonies equally; each has its champions and often they are more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bored by the rival work." [...] The critic John Warrack wrote, [...] "There are no sadder pages in symphonic literature than the close of the First Symphony's Adagio, as horn and trombones twice softly intone a phrase of utter grief", whereas to Michael Kennedy, the movement is notable for its lack of anguished yearning and angst and is marked instead by a [...] "benevolent tranquillity." ...|$|E

500|$|Nick Krewen {{gave the}} book a {{negative}} review in The Toronto Star. Krewen critiqued {{what he saw}} as the thesis to Rogan's book, commenting: [...] "Here is the premise of Van Morrison: No Surrender: Because the Belfast-born Morrison was raised in Ulster ... and subjected to violent religious prejudice, the musician embodies a symbolic metaphor of Northern Ireland's defiant nature. That's it." [...] Krewen noted that [...] "the book does capture Van the Man's evolution into an electrifying showman during his Monarchs and Them years." [...] The book also received a negative review from Martin Tierney in The Herald, who wrote: [...] "The title here is more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> contrived as Rogan attempts to draw parallels with the sectarian troubles in Morrison's home turf and the maestro himself. It doesn't work, given that Morrison has never been political, thankfully sticking to music. It is, however, detailed and comprehensive in its sources, and as such carries on that great tradition of bashing the odious one." ...|$|E
500|$|Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn, {{writers of}} Anderson's {{official}} biography, describe Mayne as the film's [...] "saving grace". However, they consider Gray's music overbearing and unsuited {{to the subject}} matter, commenting, [...] "Its innovative combination of booming brass and twangy electric guitar was possibly intended to evoke the contemporary sounds of Stanley Black or John Barry, but fell {{wide of the mark}} on both counts." [...] Crossroads to Crime is summed up as [...] "irredeemably compromised by its prosaic settings, convoluted screenplay and minuscule budget". Stephen La Rivière, writer of Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future, notes that it is [...] "remembered with dread", describing the [...] "wafer-thin" [...] story is a [...] "tedious affair" [...] before criticising the editing for producing a finished version that is [...] "more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> rough around the edges". He suggests that what little attention Crossroads to Crime receives is attributable {{to the fact that the}} Andersons would go on to produce the highly successful Thunderbirds.|$|E
500|$|Wasteland Angel {{received}} average reviews upon release, garnering {{a rating}} of 55% on the review aggregation website GameRankings. Gamers Daily News' Jeff Lindsey appreciated the perspective change accompanying the bonus level, stating, [...] "To be perfectly honest, I squealed with delight when I {{got to see the}} carnage first hand and create mayhem before your eyes." [...] Strategy Informer was not as appreciative of the jump in perspective, noting that the game's maps and engine {{did not appear to be}} designed for the first-person perspective and the mode instead presented itself as [...] "more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> jarring." [...] While Travis Huinker of Gaming Nexus criticized the game for having poor driving physics, Shack News's Jeff Mattas enjoyed the controls, stating, [...] "Though there are certain liberties taken with the driving physics, they feel right at home with the frantic, arcade-style action." [...] Ultimately, Huinker did not recommend the game, but Lindsey called it [...] "the most fun game that I have played this year".|$|E

In this film, Grint portrayed the co-lead role of Alan, an [...] boy who is Patrick's only friend. It was generally ignored by critics and audiences alike. Most of the critics that did take notice of Thunderpants did not respond well to it, with one writing: [...] "This film should be shown in prisons so that inmates have a good reason to never return." [...] Another film he appeared in was Driving Lessons, a comedy-drama released in 2006, where he starred opposite Julie Walters. The film was met with a mixed reception by critics, but his portrayal of an oppressed teenaged boy was generally praised.

James Montgomery of MTV said that after watching the video [...] "you are overcome with the sudden urge to go to the Big Apple Circus. Or pick up some Curious perfume. Or you know, possibly both". The music video won the category of Best Moves at the MTV Australia Awards 2009. It was also nominated for four VMAs at the 2009 awards in the categories of Best Art Direction, Best Choreography, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, but lost of all them. It was also nominated for Best Video in the MTV Europe Music Awards 2009, but lost to Beyoncé's [...] "Single Ladies".

He declared the scenes showing Madonna's then-boyfriend Brahim Zaibat, the singer's cleavage and booty slaps as highlights of the video. Stern concluded by saying that he [...] "thought this would be much worse because the concept is so flimsy, but I have to say: It's kind of a treat to see Madonna letting loose and having some fun." [...] Belinda White from The Daily Telegraph wrote that Madonna refused to act [...] "her age" [...] in the video but [...] "she has us more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> envious of all the fun she's having, not to mention how incredible she looks."
