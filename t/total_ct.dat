Water source 1 was a low turbidity stream with very low solids content and very low turbidity, apparent color and alkalinity. Water source 2 was reservoir water with higher turbidity, solids content and alkalinity than source 1. The ozone plant was a counter-current contactor composed of four columns in series. Variations in contact time, in the feed gas concentration (in terms of percent by weight of ozone) and in splitting of the total applied ozone dosage between columns 1 and 2 were tested. Concentration - time (CT) products were calculated and decay coefficients K were estimated from experimental data. The relative importance of water quality and certain operational parameters with regard to CT products and ozone decay was assessed. <b>Total</b> <b>CT</b> values seemed to increase with: (a) total applied ozone dosage, (b) percent by weight of ozone in the feed gas to the bubble contactor, (c) increasing contact time and (d) higher water quality, with regard to turbidity, apparent color, total organic carbon and particle counts. As the total applied ozone dosage was increased, the more important the contact time and ozone dosage configuration became for the <b>total</b> <b>CT</b> value.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Immediate {{total body}} {{computed}} tomography (CT) scanning has become {{important in the}} early diagnostic phase of trauma care because of its high diagnostic accuracy. However, literature provides limited evidence whether immediate <b>total</b> body <b>CT</b> leads to better clinical outcome then conventional radiographic imaging supplemented with selective CT scanning in trauma patients. The aim of the REACT- 2 trial {{is to determine the}} value of immediate <b>total</b> body <b>CT</b> scanning in trauma patients. DESIGN: The REACT- 2 trial is an international, multicenter randomized clinical trial. METHODS: All participating trauma centers have a multi-slice CT scanner located in the trauma room or at the Emergency Department (ED). All adult, non-pregnant, severely injured trauma patients according to predefined criteria will be included. The intervention group will receive a contrast-enhanced <b>total</b> body <b>CT</b> scan (head to pelvis) during the primary survey. The control group will be evaluated according to local conventional trauma imaging protocols (based on ATLS guidelines) supplemented with selective CT scanning. Primary outcome will be in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes are differences in mortality and morbidity during the first year post trauma, several trauma work-up time intervals, radiation exposure, general health and quality of life at 6 and 12 months post trauma and cost-effectiveness.

40|$|Background/Aim. Chronic {{sinusitis}} is {{a disease}} characterized with mucosal inflammatoion of nasal and paranasal sinuses for at least 12 weeks. In order to assess the extent and severity of inflammatory changes in paranasal sinuses CT score according to Lund-Mackay is the most commonly used. Recent studies show the possibility of existing different subtipes of chronic rhinosinusitis, pointing out the presence of nasal polyps and their influence on the severity of chronic rhinosinusitis. The aim {{of this research was}} to examine the influence of sinonasal polyposis on the extensity of inflammatory changes on computerized tomography (CT), evaluated by the Lund-Mackay CT score. Methods. A prospective study compared the Lund-Mackay CT score values between the patients with chronic rhinosinusitis associated with nasal polyps and those without them. We determined mean values of the <b>total</b> <b>CT</b> score in both groups of the patients, as well as mean values of CT score for each group of sinuses and ostiomeatal complexes. Results. The study included 90 patients, 47 males and 43 females, 45 -year old on average, diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis on the basis of diagnostic algorithm. The group with uncomplicated chronic rhinosinusitis (without nasal polyps) consisted of 30 patients and the group with complicated chronic rhinosinusitis (with nasal polyps) of 60 patients. Observing these two groups of patients revealed statistically highly important intergroup difference in CT score for each group of sinuses and ostiomeatal complexes.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine some effects of a radiation dose reduction strategy for CT in severely injured trauma patients in the emergency department. Methods We implemented the radiation dose reduction strategy in May 2009. A prospective observational study design was used to collect data from patients who met the inclusion criteria during this one year study (intervention group) from May 2009 to April 2010. The prospective data were compared with data collected retrospectively for one year prior to the implementation of the radiation dose reduction strategy (control group). By comparison of the cumulative effective dose and the number of CT examinations in the two groups, we evaluated effects of a radiation dose reduction strategy. All the patients met the institutional adult trauma team activation criteria. The radiation doses calculated by the CT scanner were converted to effective doses by multiplication by a conversion coefficient. Results A total of 118 patients were included in this study. Among them, 33 were admitted before May 2009 (control group), and 85 were admitted after May 2009 (intervention group). There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding baseline characteristics, such as injury severity and mortality.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the progression of lung disease in CF patients by means of assessing the correlation of the CT scoring system with clinical status and pulmonary function test at the Pediatric Pulmonary Ward of Masih Daneshvari Hospital in 2008. Methods: Pulmonary high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed in 23 CF patients using the Brody's scoring system. Morphologic signs as well as the extent and severity of each sign were scored, and the total score was calculated. The correlation of HRCT scores (total score as well as the score for each parameter) with Shwachman Kuczycki scoring system and pulmonary function test were examined. Results: The study included 9 female and 14 male patients with an age range of 5 - 23 years (mean: 13. 42 years). Bronchiectasis (100 %) and peribronchial wall thickening (100 %) were the most frequent CT abnormalities. Mucus plugging, air trapping and parenchymal involvements were respectively seen in 95. 7 %, 91. 3 % and 47. 8 % of patients. The overall CT score for all patients was 57. 6 ± 24. 2 (means±SD).

However, staging systems are not devoid of some limitations, among the most significant {{of which is the}} lack of recognition of early-stage patients who will progress. Unlike the guidelines for assessing the response to therapy for most other types of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, the widely-used NCI-WG guidelines for patients with CLL do not incorporate use of computed tomography (CT) scans in the algorithm. However, two recent retrospective study challenged this notion. highlighting the importance of prospective validation of CT scans before routine inclusion in CLL work up. Aims. In the present study, we investigated whether <b>total</b> body <b>CT</b> scan allowed to individuate among Binet stage A CLL patients, included in the prospective multicenter O-CLL 01 GISL study, cases in more advanced stage and whether this subgroup showed a different expression of clinical and biological prognostic markers. Patients. Up to date, 275 patients have been enrolled in the trial started in April 2007 and <b>total</b> body <b>CT</b> scan were available in 87 patients. Fifty-two patients (60 %) were male and the median age was 61 years (range, 33 to 71 years). All patients are in Binet stage A, while 83 patients were at low risk (0 -I stages) and 4 at intermediate risk (II stage) by Rai classification. LDH was elevated in 11. 5 % of cases and B 2 -microglobulin in 24 %. Twenty-eight patients (33 %) were IgVH unmutated, 31 patients (36 %) had a high ZAP- 70 expression, 17 patients (20 %) were CD 38 positive (> 30 %). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) data are available in 61 / 87 cases; the most frequent abnormality was del(13) (q 14) (29 pts 33 %), followed by trisomy 12 (5 pts, 6 %), del(17 p 13) (4 pts 5 %) and del(11 q 22. 3) (2 pts 2 %), 21 cases (24 %) were normal. Cytogenetic abnormalities were clustered in 3 risk groups [i. e. low (del(13 q 14) and normal), intermediate (trisomy 12) and high risk (del(11 q 22) and del(17 p 13) ] as suggested by others. Results. Considering <b>total</b> body <b>CT</b> scan, 22 out of 83 analyzed (25 %) patients were converted into Binet stage B. Notably, 64 % were male, LDH was elevated in 18 % of cases and B 2 -microglobulin in 18 %, 41 % were IgVH unmutated, 27 % had a high ZAP- 70 expression, 27 % were CD 38 positive, 4, 5 % showed a high-risk FISH. Both main clinical characteristics and biological prognostic markers failed to correlate with a more advanced stage. In fact, no statistically different distribution of gender, age, LDH and b 2 -microglobulin, such as IgVH mutational status, CD 38 and ZAP- 70 expression and cytogenetic abnormalities were observed between Binet A cases and Binet B. According the Rai classification 14 / 83 (17 %) low risk patients became at intermediate risk with the integration of <b>total</b> body <b>CT</b> scan. Also this subset of patients did not show a statistically different expression of all prognostic markers, but a higher rate of cases with elevated B 2 -microglobulin (p= 0. 003), than patients at low risk.

40|$|The π-stack of DNA is {{competent}} for mediating charge transport (CT), both by single-step and multi-step mechanisms. The {{yield of}} long-range single-step CT from photoexcited 2 -aminopurine to guanine across adenine tracts has a shallow, periodic distance dependence, with increasing amplitude and decreasing slope with temperature. To measure <b>total</b> <b>CT</b> yield, herein we employ the fast radical traps N 2 -cyclopropylguanine (CP G), and N 6 -cyclopropyladenine (CP A), which {{are similar to}} the unmodified bases, but undergo rapid decomposition upon oxidation. We find that decomposition of CP G by a photoexcited rhodium intercalator across an adenine tract has similar periodic distance dependence to quenching of 2 -aminopurine by guanine, and the same temperature dependence as well. In contrast, decomposition of CP G by photoexcited 2 -aminopurine is monotonic with respect to adenine tract length, and also competes with back electron transfer (BET). Eliminating BET by separating 2 -aminopurine from the adenine tract with three high-potential inosines restores the non-monotonic distance dependence. We also determined decomposition of CP A along adenine tracts by photoexcited rhodium, and found the CT yield to be distance-independent, demonstrating that the periodicity associated with guanine oxidation is with respect to adenine tract length, not donor-acceptor separation. This length-dependent periodicity, and the associated temperature dependence, support a model of conformational gating in the formation of CT-active domains along the DNA. DNA-mediated electrochemistry is facile in self-assembled monolayers on electrodes, and redox-active dyes are reduced through the DNA π-stack at potentials far lower than those of the individual bases. Since cytosine is the most readily reduced base, we incorporated CP C into DNA monolayers to assay for bridge occupation, and CP C decomposition was not observed. To explore the relative contributions of single-step and multi-step mechanisms to CT yield across adenine tracts, we compared quantum yields previously collected from 2 -aminopurine fluorescence quenching experiments to those of CP G decomposition. For seven or eight intervening adenines, single-step CT accounts for the entire CT yield, while for four to six adenines, multi-step CT is the dominant mechanism. We interrupted multi-step CT by substituting CP A for an adenine on the bridge, and found the <b>total</b> <b>CT</b> yield across five or six intervening adenines is lowered to the single-step CT yield. Blocking single-step CT by replacing the terminal guanine with redox-inactive inosine does not affect CP A decomposition on the bridge. These results imply that single-step and multi-step CT processes are not in direct competition for these assemblies, consistent with the model of conformationally gated CT-active states. ...|$|E

40|$|In mass {{casualty}} incidents (MCI) a {{large number}} of patients need to be evaluated and treated fast. Well-designed radiological guidelines can save lives. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) radiological guidelines in the MCI of an aeroplane crash. Medical data of all 126 survivors of an aeroplane crash were analysed. Data included type and body region of the radiological studies performed on the survivors, Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) and Injury Severity Score (ISS) codes and trauma care level of the hospitals. Ninety patients (72 %) underwent one or more imaging studies: in total 297 radiographs, 148 CTs and 18 ultrasounds were performed. Only 18 % received diagnostic imaging of all four body regions as recommended by ATLS. Compliance with ATLS was highest (73. 3 %) in severely injured victims (ISS ≥ 16); this group underwent two thirds of the (near) <b>total</b> body <b>CTs,</b> all performed in level I trauma centres. Overall compliance with ATLS radiological guidelines was low, although high in severely injured patients. Level I trauma centres frequently used (near) <b>total</b> body <b>CT.</b> Deviation from ATLS guidelines in radiological work-up in less severely injured patients can be safe and did not result in delayed diagnosis of serious injury. • Radiological imaging protocols can assist the management of mass casualty incidents needs. • Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) radiological guidelines have been developed. • But radiological guidelines have not frequently been applied in aeroplane crashes. • Aircraft accidents are of high energy so ATLS guidelines should be applied. • Following mass casualty incidents <b>total</b> body <b>CT</b> seems appropriate within ATLS protocol...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{hypothesize that}} the {{standardized}} uptake value (SUV) from PET/computed tomography (CT) {{can act as}} an adjunct to forced vital capacity (FVC) in evaluating disease status in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). METHODS: Eight consecutive male patients diagnosed with IPF were prospectively recruited to undergo full pulmonary function tests, high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax and PET/CT. The corrected mean SUV (rSUVmean) and corrected maximum SUV (rSUVmax) against the mediastinal blood pool were correlated with clinical parameters. Examinations were repeated 6 months later in six patients (2 / 8 patients had died) and changes were evaluated. Correlation was assessed by Spearman's rank correlation, and statistical significance was considered when the P-value was less than 0. 05. RESULTS: The rSUVmean in IPF was negatively correlated with FVC (r=- 0. 6, P= 0. 024) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (r=- 0. 7, P= 0. 010). The decline in FVC was associated with an increment in rSUVmax (r=- 0. 9, P= 0. 019), but no similar observation was made with <b>total</b> <b>CT</b> score (r=- 0. 1, P= 0. 787). CONCLUSION: Pulmonary metabolism, rSUVmean, contributes to the functional status of IPF patients, and changes in rSUVmax may serve as an adjunct surrogate marker to FVC in evaluating the disease status in IPF patients...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{peripheral blood}} lymphocyte subpopulations, particularly helper T (Th) cells and cytokine expression before and after treatment in polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM). Patients and Methods Ten patients with PM and 15 with DM were enrolled in this study. As a control we used 11 age-matched healthy subjects. We analyzed {{peripheral blood lymphocyte}}s using flow cytometry. Serum cytokines were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Th 2 /Th 1 and Th 2 /Th 17 ratios were significantly higher in both PM and DM than in controls and this Th 2 -predominancy is marked in DM associated with interstitial pneumonia. IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TGF-β were significantly higher in both PM and DM and IL- 4 showed {{a significant increase in}} DM when compared to controls. There was no significant correlation between either any lymphocyte subpopulations or serum cytokines and clinical severity markers such as the manual muscle strength test, serum creatine kinase, and the <b>total</b> <b>CT</b> score. Th 2 /Th 17 in both PM and DM, as well as Th 2 /Th 1 in the latter, significantly decreased after clinical remission compared with before treatment. Conclusions Th 2 -predominancy as shown by the increase in Th 2 /Th 1 and Th 2 /Th 17 ratios may suggest active disease in PM/DM but does not reflect clinical severity...|$|E
40|$|As protein binding of uremic toxins is {{not well}} understood, neither in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, nor during a {{hemodialysis}} (HD) session, we studied protein binding in two cross-sectional studies. Ninety-five CKD 2 to 5 patients and ten stable hemodialysis patients were included. Blood samples were taken either during the routine ambulatory visit (CKD patients) or from blood inlet and outlet line during dialysis (HD patients). <b>Total</b> (<b>CT)</b> and free concentrations were determined of p-cresylglucuronide (pCG), hippuric acid (HA), indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresylsulfate (pCS), and their percentage protein binding (%PB) was calculated. In CKD patients, %PB/CT resulted in a positive correlation (all p < 0. 001) with renal function for all five uremic toxins. In HD patients, %PB was increased after 120 min of dialysis for HA and at the dialysis end for the stronger (IAA) and the highly-bound (IS and pCS) solutes. During one passage through the dialyzer at 120 min, %PB was increased for HA (borderline), IAA, IS and pCS. These findings explain why protein-bound solutes are difficult to remove by dialysis: {{a combination of the}} fact that (i) only the free fraction can pass the filter and (ii) the equilibrium, as it was pre-dialysis, cannot be restored during the dialysis session, as it is continuously disturbed...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} iterative reconstruction (IR) on reconstruction time and speed in two commonly encountered acquisition protocols in an emergency setting: pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) and <b>total</b> body trauma <b>CT.</b> Methods Twenty-five patients underwent a pulmonary CTA for evaluation of pulmonary embolisms and 15 patients underwent a <b>total</b> body <b>CT</b> after a traumatic event on a 256 -slice CT. Images were reconstructed with filtered back-projection (FBP) and two IR levels. Reconstruction time and speed were quantified using custom written software. Results Mean reconstruction time delays for pulmonary CTAs were 10 ± 10 s and 12 ± 12 s for IR levels 2 and 4, respectively, and 44 ± 8 s and 45 ± 7 s for <b>total</b> body trauma <b>CTs</b> for IR levels 1 and 6, respectively. Mean reconstruction times and speeds for pulmonary CTAs were 26 ± 7 s, 36 ± 9 s and 38 ± 12 s, and 26. 7 ± 5. 6 slices/s, 18. 7 ± 2. 3 slices/s and 18. 0 ± 2. 8 slices/s for FBP, IR levels 2 and 4, respectively. For <b>total</b> body trauma <b>CTs</b> these values were 87 ± 15 s, 132 ± 17 s and 132 ± 18 s, and 20. 1 ± 1. 6 slices/s, 13. 2 ± 0. 8 slices/s and 13. 2 ± 0. 6 slices/s for FBP, IR levels 1 and 6, respectively. Conclusions IR does not result in clinically important CT image reconstruction delays in an emergency setting. No substantial differences in reconstruction time and speed were found between different IR levels.

Inorganic carbon is also closely linked to the chemical processes that occur when carbon dioxide gas (CO 2) dissolved in water. The research of inorganic carbon in the waters of Beras Basah was carried out in January, February and March 2012. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the distribution and concentration of <b>total</b> inorganic carbon (<b>CT)</b> in coral reef and seagrass ecosystems as well as the correlation of Beras Basah. The results showed that the concentration of <b>total</b> inorganic carbon (<b>CT)</b> in January average 1166. 503 μmol/kgSW, February average 1115. 599 μmol/kgSW, and then in March the average 987. 443 μmol/kgSW. Distribution patterns of <b>total</b> inorganic carbon (<b>CT)</b> is vectoral, where in January, the concentration of <b>total</b> inorganic carbon (<b>CT)</b> was highest in the Southeast region, was in February in the South and Southeast, while in March shifted to North region of Beras Basah Island.
