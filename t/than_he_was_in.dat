5|$|When Philip {{began his}} attack in 349 BC, the Olynthians appealed to Athens for aid. In response, Demosthenes gave {{a series of}} speeches, {{now known as the}} Olynthiacs, {{encouraging}} the Athenians to resist Philip. The period from 351 BC to 346 BC marks the gradual ascendancy of Demosthenes in Athenian politics, as he became leader of the Athenian resistance to Philip. However, exactly when Demosthenes became important is disputed; Cawkwell points out that the chance preservation of a good proportion of Demosthenes's speeches may make him seem more important <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> <b>In</b> the end, the Athenians decided to send a force of 2000 lightly armed mercenaries (referred to in the sources as peltasts, even if strictly speaking, they were not), and 38 triremes to aid the Olynthians. Of these triremes, 30 were already in service under Chares, possibly operating in the north Aegean; the other 8 were to be crewed by Athenians citizens. However, {{it is not clear whether}} this force achieved anything.|$|E
5|$|While the {{scientists}} argued over classifications and nomenclature, they also returned west for more fossils. Marsh made his last trip backed by Yale in 1873, {{with a large}} group of thirteen students accompanying him, protected by a group of soldiers who wanted to make a show of force to the Sioux tribe. Due to concerns over his more lavish and expensive expeditions in years past, Marsh had the students pay their own way, and the trip cost Yale only $1857.50, far less than the $15,000 (over $200,000 in modern currency) that Marsh had claimed for the previous expedition. This excursion would prove to be Marsh's last: {{for the rest of the}} Bone Wars, Marsh preferred to enlist the services of local collectors. Though he had enough bones to study for years, the scientist's appetite for more would grow. Cope was even more prolific in his collecting that season <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> 1872, although Marsh's penchant for cultivating collectors of his own meant that at Bridger his rival was persona non grata. Tired of working under Hayden, Cope found a paying job with the Army Corps of Engineers, but was limited by this federal association; while Cope had to tag along on surveys, Marsh could collect wherever he pleased.|$|E
25|$|In Chinese opera, Zhou Yu is {{cast as a}} xiaosheng (小生; young {{character}}) or wusheng (武生; {{character in}} military dress), even when he appears together with Zhuge Liang, who was actually younger <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> <b>In</b> Kun opera, Zhou Yu appears as a zhiweisheng, as in the scene The Swaying Reeds, in which Zhang Fei captured him but released him later.|$|E

Sayama is much heavier <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his younger days, and as a result, his style has changed; he focuses more on mat-based wrestling, though he still uses his trademark martial arts kicks. Fans, young and old, seem quite pleased just to see Sayama in any form these days.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 10, Bonin {{was arrested}} for {{stealing}} vehicle license plates and {{was placed in a}} juvenile detention center for other minor crimes. While housed at this juvenile detention center, he was repeatedly physically and sexually abused by several people, including his adult counselor. Four years later, in 1961, facing the prospect of the foreclosure of their home, Bonin's parents opted to relocate to California. The Bonin family settled in a modest home on Angell Street in the city of Downey; shortly thereafter, Bonin's father died from cirrhosis of the liver. While living at this address, Bonin is known to have molested both his younger brother, and several neighborhood children. Many of these neighborhood children were lured into Bonin's home with the promise of alcohol, and all his known victims were younger <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> <b>In</b> addition to these acts of molestation, Bonin is known to have committed several acts of robbery, petty theft, and grand theft in his teenage years.|$|E
25|$|Brahms's father, Johann Jakob Brahms (1806–72), {{was from}} the town of Heide in Holstein. The family name was also {{sometimes}} spelt 'Brahmst' or 'Brams', and derives from 'Bram', the German word for the shrub broom. Against the family's will, Johann Jakob pursued a career in music, arriving in Hamburg in 1826, where he found work as a jobbing musician and a string and wind player. In 1830, he married Johanna Henrika Christiane Nissen (1789–1865), a seamstress 17 years older <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> <b>In</b> the same year he was appointed as a horn player in the Hamburg militia. Eventually he became a double-bass player in the Hamburg Stadttheater and the Hamburg Philharmonic Society. As Johann Jakob prospered, the family moved over the years to ever better accommodation in Hamburg. Johannes Brahms was born in 1833; his sister Elisabeth (Elise) had been born in 1831 and a younger brother Fritz Friedrich (Fritz) was born in 1835. Fritz also became a pianist; overshadowed by his brother he emigrated to Caracas in 1867, and later returned to Hamburg as a teacher.|$|E

25|$|After {{graduating from}} Chaminade in 1967, O'Reilly {{attended}} Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York. While at Marist, {{he was a}} punter in the National Club Football Association and also wrote for the school's newspaper, The Circle. He was an honors student who majored in history. He spent his junior year of college abroad, attending Queen Mary College at the University of London. He received his bachelor of arts degree in history in 1971. He played semi-professional baseball during this time as a pitcher for the New York Monarchs. After graduating from Marist College, O'Reilly moved to Miami, where he taught English and history at Monsignor Pace High School from 1970 to 1972. He returned to school in 1973 and earned a master of arts degree in broadcast journalism from Boston University. While attending Boston University, he was a reporter and columnist for various local newspapers and alternative news weeklies, including the Boston Phoenix, and did an internship in the newsroom of WBZ-TV. During his time at BU, {{he also was a}} classmate of future radio talk show host Howard Stern, whom O'Reilly noticed because Stern was the only student on campus taller <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> <b>In</b> 1995, he attended the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and received a master of public administration degree in 1996.|$|E

The two became friends, {{but it was not until}} 1979 that she moved to live with him in California.

500|$|Nomura was {{responsible}} for the character designs, which changed much of the look and style of Yoshitaka Amano's illustrations. Working in the Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy IX designs brought no difficulties since in for the former game, Nomura based his designs on Amano's illustrations while he had already been involved in handling his illustrations in the latter. On the other hand, Nomura had difficulties making Onion Knight as it ended being too cartoony and requested advice from Amano. Nomura's own original illustrations were also redesigned for Dissidia; Nomura commented to the Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu that Tidus was designed to look younger <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Final Fantasy X to [...] "match the design touch {{of the rest of the}} Dissidia" [...] cast.|$|E
500|$|Rodman {{and his two}} sisters, Debra and Kim, {{grew up in the}} Oak Cliff {{section of}} Dallas, at the time one of the most impoverished areas of the city. Rodman was so {{attached}} to his mother that he refused to move when she sent him to a nursery when he was four years old. According to Rodman, his mom was more interested in his two sisters, who were both considered more talented <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> basketball, and made him a laughing stock whenever he tagged along with them. He felt generally [...] "overwhelmed" [...] by the all-female household. Debra and Kim would go on to become All-Americans at Louisiana Tech and Stephen F. Austin, respectively. Debra won two national titles with the Lady Techsters.|$|E

[...] Patton then argued that his Third Army should attack toward Koblenz, cutting off the bulge at the base and trap the entirety of the German armies involved in the offensive. After briefly considering this, Bradley vetoed this proposal, as he was less concerned about killing large numbers of Germans <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> arranging for the relief of Bastogne before it was overrun. Desiring good weather for his advance, which would permit close ground support by U.S. Army Air Forces tactical aircraft, Patton ordered the Third Army chaplain, Colonel James Hugh O'Neill, to compose a suitable prayer: ...|$|E

500|$|Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès, in a psychoanalytical {{analysis}} of Tintin in Tibet, observes that Tintin is more firmly {{in control of}} the plot <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> earlier adventures. Apostolidès notes that the character displays worry and emotion not present previously, something he suggested showed Tintin sorting out the problems that he faced in life. In his analysis, he calls Tintin a [...] "foundling" [...] and his friend Chang [...] "the lost child" [...] and [...] "Tintin's twin... the heroes have to struggle to great heights to escape the temporality and pervasive values of [...] universe." [...] He saw the Yeti, who [...] "internalises certain human characteristics", as more complex than Hergé's previous bestial character, Ranko in The Black Island: [...] "The monster loves Chang with a love as unconditional as Tintin's love for his friend." ...|$|E
500|$|Another great {{passion that}} is {{depicted}} in Traherne's work is his love {{of nature and the}} natural world, frequently displayed in a very Romantic treatment of nature that has been described as characteristically pantheist or panentheist. While Traherne credits a divine source for its creation, his praise of nature seems nothing less than what one would expect to find in Thoreau. Many scholars consider Traherne a writer of the sublime, and in his writing he seems to have tried to reclaim the lost appreciation for the natural world, as well as paying tribute to what he knew of in nature that was more powerful <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> <b>In</b> this sense Traherne seems to have anticipated the Romantic movement more than 130 years before it actually occurred. There is frequent discussion of man's almost symbiotic relationship with nature, as well as frequent use of [...] "literal setting", that is, an attempt to faithfully reproduce a sense experience from a given moment, a technique later used frequently by William Wordsworth.|$|E
500|$|A film {{adaptation}} {{based on}} the game was originally announced in May 2002 by Columbia Pictures. The film was being produced by Laura Ziskin, along with Greg Pruss attached with writing the screenplay. Peter Schlessel, president of the production for Columbia Pictures, and Paul Baldwin, {{president of marketing for}} Eidos Interactive, stated that they were confident in that the adaptation would be a successful development for both the studios and the franchise. In March 2003, during an interview with Greg Pruss, he informed IGN that the character of JC Denton will be [...] "a little bit filthier <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the game." [...] He further stated that the script was shaping up to be darker in tone than the original game. Although a release date was scheduled for 2006, the film never got past the scripting stage.In 2012, CBS films revived the project, buying the rights and commissioning a film inspired by the Deux Ex series; its direct inspiration will be the 2011 game [...] [...] C. Robert Cargill and Scott Derrickson are writing the screenplay, and Derrickson will direct the film.|$|E
2500|$|Léone Teyssandier {{writes that}} a {{possible}} motive for Iago's actions is envy towards Desdemona, Cassio and Othello; Iago sees them as more noble, generous and, {{in the case}} of Cassio, more handsome <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> <b>In</b> particular, <b>he</b> sees the death of Cassio as a necessity, saying of him that [...] "He hath a daily beauty in his life that makes me ugly".|$|R
5000|$|Julian {{has been}} criticized by {{historian}} Robert Browning for crediting its subject with sexual exploits {{for which there is}} no evidence.

500|$|Nash was {{slower and}} more portly <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the 1930s, short of match {{practice}} {{and forced to}} spend most Sundays in hospital having fluid drained from his injured knees swollen from the exertions of the day before, forcing South Melbourne coach Bull Adams to nurse Nash through the season. Additionally, in the Round 5 match against Footscray, he tore the webbing between his fingers which later became infected, causing him to miss the Round 6 match against North Melbourne and although Nash wore a special leather glove to protect his hand, the injury would trouble him {{for the rest of}} the season. Despite these setbacks, Nash could still be a match winner and many opposition players saw him as the key player for South Melbourne. Nash's best return for the year was seven goals against St Kilda in Round 12 and he twice kicked six goals in a match; against Geelong in Round 15 and Fitzroy in Round 18. When an opposition player did well against Nash, it was something to savour; years later leading Richmond player Don [...] "Mopsy" [...] Fraser wrote [...] "Trouncing Nash does a lot for your confidence, even an ageing Nash." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Terri Schwartz {{gave the}} episode a [...] "good" [...] 7.8 out of 10, calling the {{blackout}} plot [...] "fairly throwaway" [...] but a backdrop to [...] "tell {{far more interesting}} stories", with Luna's Reyes continuing to be the strongest new element of the season. Schwartz criticized the episode's killing and resurrection of May as [...] "one of the weaker storytelling tricks in an otherwise solid episode—and as expected, May came back and is just fine." [...] Writing for Nerdist, Joseph McCabe had mixed feelings about the episode's political angle {{and the use of}} Inhumans as a stand-in for minorities, but praised the chemistry between Coulson, Mack, and Fitz, and the further exploration of Jeffrey Mace. McCabe was highly critical of guest star Lorenzo James Henrie, calling him [...] "no more charismatic here <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Fear the Walking Dead, and his character is every bit as unsympathetic as his misguided rebel was on that show, wheelchair or no." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush was particularly negative, feeling the episodes' different storylines [...] "ended up feeling like three disparate stories with some notable reaching'. He felt the Inhuman prejudice storyline and attack by looters on Gabe were forced, and that the May storyline did not [...] "really [...] our idea of where the AI or ghostly threads will end up". Fitzpatrick did think that the introduction of Nagra would [...] "help Season 4 find its footing again" [...] with a more focused overarching story.|$|E
