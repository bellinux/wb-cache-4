25|$|The Greenside Mine worked {{this vein}} from {{some time in}} the 1700s until {{reserves}} were exhausted in 1962. The main entrance was in Glenridding at Lucy’s Tongue, but an exploratory level was driven into the cliffs at the top of Glencoyne, from just below the Miners' Balcony Path. In 1955 this was incorporated into an emergency back exit from the mine. Alfred Wainwright found the hole, but <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a cave.|$|E

6000|$|All the day Clym {{had borne}} himself {{as if his}} mind were too full of its own matter {{to allow him to}} care about outward things, and his words now showed what had {{occupied}} his <b>thoughts.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> after the mysterious knocking that he began the theme. [...] "Since I have been away today, Eustacia, I have considered that something must be done to heal up this ghastly breach between my dear mother and myself. It troubles me." ...|$|R

25|$|While {{there were}} no {{external}} witnesses of the capsizing of Finn-Baltic, it was noticed by several people on the shore shortly afterwards and the rescue operation began within minutes of the accident even though the ship had not sent a distress signal. Around 12:30 the harbour bailiff of the Port of Hanko saw something odd amid the waves while standing at {{the window of his}} office. At first he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a barge being towed by a tug, but after spotting first the red bottom of the vessel and then its propeller and rudder, he realized that a ship had capsized in the storm and immediately contacted the captain of the rescue vessel Russarö, who alerted the Maritime Rescue Sub-Centre (MRSC) of Hanko at 12:40. At the same time a harbour worker standing on one of the easternmost quays saw something that resembled a new island {{in the middle of the}} storm. At first he, too, thought that it was just a towing, but was bothered by several strange details in the barge, such as the bow thruster, and decided to go get binoculars. When he came back to get a better view, he saw Russarö heading out. Finn-Baltic was also photographed only minutes before the combination capsized by a harbour worker, who remembered hearing a rumbling sound, like a freight train, shortly after taking the picture of the ship.|$|E
500|$|Engineering of {{the song}} was done by Emily Wright and Sam Holland at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. While Kesha was {{in the studio with}} Dr. Luke and Blanco, she took three takes to get the song correct as she jokingly [...] "white-girl rapped" [...] over the beat. At one point in the song's production, she had wanted to re-write the verses {{of the song}} because she did not think that they were [...] "funny or clever", feeling that they [...] "kind of sucked." [...] She elaborated, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> another song, I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> like all the other ones I'd written. I didn't even know if it was very good. I wanted to rewrite the verses, I didn't think it was funny or clever. I thought it kind of sucked. But {{everyone}} else liked it." [...] Kesha ultimately did not end up rewriting any of the song's lyrics. She further described the theme of the song in an interview, emphasizing that it embodied her own lifestyle, ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Windy City Media Group, Stefani said [...] " [...] was so perfect for my story-for what I was feeling in my own personal life-that I didn't even get it as a feminist anthem. I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> about me! I was just feeling me." [...] After the release of [...] "Baby Don't Lie" [...] a month prior, [...] "Spark the Fire" [...] was released on December 1, 2014.|$|E

500|$|Along with [...] "The Pandorica Opens", [...] "The Big Bang" [...] {{was awarded}} the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form), the fifth time Doctor Who has won the award, and the fourth time a Steven Moffat episode has won. In February 2013, Moffat stated that [...] "The Big Bang" [...] was his {{personal}} favourite among the Doctor Who episodes he wrote.

There's not a weak link in the team here and it's an honour to be asked to be part of it". Other featured guests included: ...|$|E
500|$|Jagger told Stephen Schiff in a 1992 Vanity Fair profile: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to}} be rebellious in those days; I was just being me. I wasn't trying to push the edge of anything. I'm being me and ordinary, the guy from {{suburbia}} who sings in this band, but someone older might have <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the most awful racket, the most terrible thing, and {{where are we going}} if this is music?... But all those songs we sang were pretty tame, really. People didn't think they were, but I thought they were tame." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{dismissed}} the subject from my <b>thoughts.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> then I remembered that, after all, I had not gathered from Louis a single shred {{of information on}} the subject in which I was most interested. I almost smiled when I remembered how admirably he had contrived to elude my curiosity. The only thing which I gathered from his manner was that Mr. Delora's disappearance was unexpected by him. Never mind, the end was not yet! I ordered coffee and a liqueur, and laid my cigarette case upon the table. I would wait until Louis chose to come to me once more. There were certain things which I intended to ask him point blank.|$|R
500|$|When {{deciding}} the band's next single, Ray Davies pushed for [...] "Come Dancing" [...] {{to be released}} rather than [...] "Don't Forget to Dance," [...] which had been suggested by the record company as the first single from State of Confusion. The UK branch of Arista Records approved this decision, releasing 7-inch and 12-inch versions of the new single on 19 November 1982 with [...] "Noise" [...] as the B-side. However, Clive Davis initially had reservations; Davies recalls that Davis [...] "didn't {{want to put it}} out because it was too much of an English subject matter". Davis also <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a [...] "ditty" [...] and did not have enough substance to be a single.|$|E
500|$|Morrison {{recalled}} his {{first encounter with}} Dylan's music {{in an interview in}} 2000: [...] "I think I heard [...] in a record shop in Smith Street. And I just <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it... The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens the whole thing up." [...] Morrison's record producer at the time, Bert Berns, encouraged him to find models for his songs, so he bought Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home album in March 1965. One of the songs on the album held a unique fascination for Morrison and he soon started performing [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] in small clubs and pubs as a solo artist (without Them).|$|E
500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Born Again tour in March 1984, vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re-join Deep Purple, which was reforming after a long hiatus. Bevan left at the same time, and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like [...] "hired help" [...] by Iommi. The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named David Donato. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer Bob Ezrin in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after. Disillusioned with the band's revolving line-up, bassist Geezer Butler quit Black Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band. [...] "When Ian Gillan took over {{that was the end of}} it for me", Butler later said. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a joke and I just totally left. When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album. After we had done the album we gave it to Warner Bros. and they said they were going to put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn't have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it. That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it." ...|$|E

Shamrock injured his shoulder during the fight against Kimo. He originally <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> [...] "wear and tear", but a MRI revealed a rotator cuff tear. Shamrock had surgery to repair the tear in his shoulder.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas {{wrote of}} the Court's {{proposed}} alternatives that, [...] "aside from being constitutionally unnecessary, [...] are also burdensome, impractical, and {{no more likely to}} effect notice than the methods actually employed by the State." [...] Regular mail lacks the paper trail of certified mail, and Thomas <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> as likely that mail addressed to [...] "occupant" [...] would be thrown out as junk mail as opened and read as the Court had speculated. He also stated that the Court had previously concluded that posting notices was [...] "an inherently unreliable method." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{last straw}} was the Greatest Hits album….I can {{honestly}} say that I sold myself short {{for the last six}} months...I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> better to <b>just</b> stop it and move on.|$|R

It didn't seem possible to get any further. Nothing that I could do or say seemed able to procure for me an engagement in New York. Think of {{me for a moment}} now, Philip, as a woman absolutely and entirely devoted to her work. I loved it. It absorbed all my <b>thoughts.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the one thing in life I cared anything about. I simply ached to get at New York, and I couldn't. All the time I had to play on tour, and you won't quite understand this, dear, but there is nothing so wearing in life as for any one with my cravings for recognition there to be always playing on the road." ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceStatistics is a {{quantitative}} approach to research. Its relationship with {{math and science}} makes it at best ignored by the humanities community, at worst avoided. Indeed, humanities are known to attract students who flee the hard sciences. Even sadly, quantitative data are sometimes wrongly accused to destroy the "magic" in literary texts. On the contrary, I intend to demonstrate in my presentation that statistics can contribute to linguistics. There is another false idea that grows {{in the mind of}} students in humanities I want to fight: programing is only for math people. As a matter of fact, programing {{has more to do with}} logic and linguistics than we would have <b>thought.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> like learning a new language and who is better at this than a student in humanities?With only a few tools, we will build a program in Python that analyse a multilingual corpus of various texts (fiction, essay) and gives quantitative data and graphs as well...|$|R
2500|$|Mittal's {{involvement}} {{came about}} after a chance meeting with Johnson in a cloakroom in Davos in January 2009, {{as they were}} on their way to separate dinner engagements. In a conversation that reportedly lasted 45 seconds Johnson pitched the idea to Mittal, who immediately agreed to supply the steel. Mittal later said of his involvement, [...] "I never expected that this was going to be such a huge project. I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the supply of some steel, a thousand tonnes or so, and that would be it. But then we started working with artists and I realised that the object was not just to supply steel but to complete the whole project. It took us almost 15 months of negotiation and discussion." [...] Johnson has said that, [...] "In reality, ArcelorMittal has given much more than the steel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pettyfer {{has seven}} tattoos, {{including}} a Celtic cross on his chest, Tibetan script {{on the inside}} of his right arm, the words [...] "What Goes Around Comes Around" [...] on his right shoulder, a Katakana script on his lower waist, and the letters [...] "ER," [...] the initials of ex-girlfriend Emma Roberts inside interlinking hearts on his right wrist. When Contactmusic asked him about the [...] "ER" [...] tattoo he said [...] "I don't know how to say it, she's a lovely, lovely girl, we had a spell of something that is over now, but we're on good terms. She's beautiful, she's great; we're really good friends." [...] The actor had Roberts' name tattooed on his wrist while the two were dating. [...] "I'm going to get asked about this, aren't I? I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> between me and her," [...] he said when asked about the tattoo.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{his early}} tutors {{were among the}} first to use the thumbpick in guitar playing, freeing the fingers to pick melody, Travis's style, {{according}} to Chet Atkins, went on in musical directions [...] "never dreamt about" [...] by his predecessors. His trademark mature style incorporated elements from ragtime, blues, boogie, jazz and Western swing, and was marked by rich chord progressions, harmonics, slides and bends, and rapid changes of key. [...] He could shift quickly from finger-picking to flatpicking in the midst of a number by gripping his thumbpick like a flat pick. In his hands, the guitar resembled a full band. As his son Thom Bresh puts it, on first hearing his father as a child [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the coolest sound, because it sounded like a whole bunch of instruments coming from one guitar. In it, I heard rhythm parts, I heard melodies, I heard chords and all this wrapped up in one." [...] Equally at home on acoustic and electric guitar, Travis was one of the first to exploit the full range of techniques and sonorities available on the electric guitar.|$|E
5000|$|The album also {{contains}} a cover of [...] "Throw It Away", written by singer Abbey Lincoln. [...] "On that one, he’d (Foreman) learned it and I hadn’t heard the original one yet at all," [...] said Watkins of their recording process for the song. [...] "He played <b>it</b> and I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> great, <b>just</b> a good song with a great arrangement. We added a couple things to it and used it." ...|$|R

40|$|I {{was driving}} home {{late one night}} when {{suddenly}} a dozen red taillights flashed in front of me. I hit my brakes. In my peripheral vision, I caught sight of a pile of clothing lying in the center lane. At first I <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> some garbage that had come {{off the back of}} a truck. But as I rolled slowly past, I developed a sickening feeling. The clothing was not arranged randomly. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> held together in some dimly recognizable order...|$|R
