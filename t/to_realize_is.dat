500|$|From the {{beginning}} of spring training, Heyward endured lingering shoulder soreness. [...] After collecting just four hits in 41 at bats in May, the Braves performed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan on May 12 which revealed an inflamed rotator cuff but no structural damage. [...] He rested and received a cortisone injection, but aggravated the injury days later during batting practice. [...] The Braves placed him {{on the disabled list}} (DL) on May 22. [...] Public criticism from teammate Chipper Jones for not playing through his injuries followed the next month. [...] Said Jones, [...] "I think where Jason might have erred was the comment that he made, 'I'm not coming back until it doesn't hurt anymore.' ...

2500|$|The {{first thing}} <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>is</b> that the pawn {{may be able}} to queen unassisted by his king, simply by {{advancing}} to the queening square before the opposing king can capture or block the pawn. The rule of the square is useful in determining whether the pawn can queen unassisted, or whether the king can stop the pawn. In this position, the pawn is on the fifth square from the queening square (counting the queening square itself). [...] A square of five by five squares with the queening square in one corner and the pawn in an adjacent corner can be imagined. (Often, the easiest method of constructing the square is to draw a diagonal mentally from the pawn to the last rank; this is the diagonal of the square). [...] If the black king can move into this square, he can stop the pawn, otherwise the pawn wins the race. In this position, if it is Black's move, he can move to b4 and enter the square, therefore he can stop the pawn. If it is White's move, the pawn advances, the square shrinks to four by four, and the king cannot move into the square, so the pawn queens [...] See [...] for further discussion on the rule of the square.|$|E
