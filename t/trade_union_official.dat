5|$|Stephen Owen Davies (before 1889 – 25 February 1972), {{generally}} {{known as}} S. O. Davies, was a Welsh miner, <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>official</b> and Labour Party politician, {{who served as}} the Member of Parliament (MP) for Merthyr Tydfil from 1950 to 1972, and previously Merthyr from 1934 to 1950. In 1970, when well past 80, he was deselected as parliamentary candidate by his local party association on account of his age. He fought the constituency in the 1970 general election as an Independent and won comfortably, a rare example in British politics of an independent candidate defeating a major party's organisation.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1917, Rau, by {{this time}} an elected <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>official</b> in his firm, participated {{in the attempt to}} organise a strike against the war. His action led to a {{reprimand}} from his employer, and may have hastened his conscription into the army in August 1917. In the army he was trained in the Zuffenhausen-garrisoned Infantry Regiment 126 and deployed to the Western Front as member of a machine gun company. In September 1918 a shell splinter penetrated his lungs. In the following weeks, he was treated in military hospitals in Weimar and in Stuttgart's neighbouring town Ludwigsburg. While in Ludwigsburg, Rau managed to get leave at short notice on 8November 1918 and joined the in those days developing revolution in Stuttgart.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{elevation}} as premier Heffron, {{following an}} approved motion from the 1958 state conference, reanimated the longstanding Labor policy {{to abolish the}} Legislative Council of New South Wales by announcing a statewide referendum on this question. Heffron had long supported this policy from his Langite days, seeing the council as an outdated bastion of conservative privilege, a position that was echoed by <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>official</b> {{and member of the}} Legislative Council, Tom Dougherty, who had pushed through a rule at the 1952 state conference that banned MLCs from becoming members of the state party executive. However, Heffron's efforts found themselves up against significant opposition, not only from the Liberal and Country parties but also within the Labor party itself. Indeed, when the 'Constitution Amendment (Legislative Council Abolition) Bill' came before the Legislative Council on 2 December 1959, the council resolved 33 votes to 25 to send it back to the Legislative Assembly on the grounds that such a bill should have originated in the council. This was passed with the support of seven Labor councillors crossing the floor (including Cyril Cahill, Anne Press and Donald Cochrane), who were all subsequently expelled from the party and formed the Independent Labor Group.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{research focuses on}} <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> organisations, and in particular <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> officialdom in Egypt. The study examines {{the extent to which}} <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> at the various levels of the <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> hierarchy are reacting to reforms instigated by structural adjustment policies. The adoption of structural adjustment and economic reform measures as proposed by the World Bank and IMF have resulted in the government's withdrawal of some of the benefits and privileges it accorded to workers. Public sector workers are particularly affected by these changes, thereby posing a challenge to <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> officialdom, since the bulk of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> membership is within the public sector. <b>Trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> are reacting to the reform measures by trying to balance their role as representatives of workers' interests and their role in administering state policy. Whereas in the past these two roles were reconcilable, however, with liberalisation of the economy and the adoption of structural adjustment measures that is no longer tenable. Trade unionism has been weakened by the incorporation of <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> within government corporate structures, making it more difficult for <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> officialdom to challenge the reform measures adopted by the government. Rather, <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> are opting for `co-operation' both with the government and with management in enterprises, to the cost of workers. In enterprises, <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> emphasise that the interests of work and workers are inseparable. At the level of the confederation and general <b>unions,</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> present themselves as working to keep workers' rights, but also as partners with the government in its drive for growth. By so doing <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> are de-politicising <b>trade</b> unionism, and instead focus on economic gains. <b>Union</b> <b>officials</b> are redefining their role away from workers. <b>Trade</b> <b>union</b> action at the various levels is not based on what workers want or demand, but rather on what <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> want, in the belief that workers do not truly know their interests. As a result, <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> action has promoted the interests of <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> rather than that of the workers. Trade unionism has become in a sense a shell without a content. However, there is evidence that there are pressures to democratise trade unionism and make it more responsive to worker demands. These pressures are from within the worker base, from <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>officials</b> particularly at the enterprise level who are affilited to political parties, and from external forces like the Islamists. However these forces have their limitations, particularly in the face of institutionalised sectors that are capable of reproducing themselves and promoting their interests...|$|R
