Vaubois again refused, with the reply [...] "Cette place est en trop bon état, et je suis moi-même trop jaloux de bien servir men payset de conserver mon honneur, por écouter vos propositions." [...] ("This place is in too good a situation, and I am too conscious of the service of my country and my honour, <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> proposals"). In reality, the situation was dire: during February, prices of basic foodstuffs stood at 16 francs for a fowl, 12 francs for a rabbit, 20 sous for an egg, 18 sous for a lettuce, 40 sous for a rat and six francs per pound for fish. For the civilian typhus patients, the only food available was a horse-flesh soup.|$|E
500|$|Aboard Guillaume Tell, the British found {{evidence}} {{of the severity of}} the food shortages in Valletta: [...] "the only thing found in La Guillaume Tell was the leg of a mule, hung for safety and his especial use of the admiral's stern-galley". News of the capture of Guillaume Tell was immediately passed to Vaubois by the British besiegers, along with a demand that he surrender the island. The French general, despite dwindling food supplies, refused, stating [...] "Cette place est en trop bon état, et je suis moi-même trop jaloux de bien servir mon pays et de conserver mon honneur, pour écouter vos propositions." [...] ("This place is in too good a situation, and I am too conscious of the service of my country and my honour, <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> proposals"). Despite Vaubois' defiance, the garrison was rapidly starving, and although the French commander resisted until 4 September, he was eventually forced to surrender Valletta and all of its military equipment to the British.|$|E

[...] Taylor ended the review with positive feedback for Madonna's vocals, likening them {{to those for}} the Evita album, along with commending the chorus. In a different article for Billboard talking about the song's remixes, Paoletta described the track as [...] "effervescent blast of psychedelic electronica". Writing for the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Gino DeLa Paz found it [...] "cute but forgettable". Gwen Ihnat, from the entertainment website The A.V. Club, labeled it as [...] "Madonna's best song that never appeared {{on one of her}} regular albums [...] a psychedelic pop confection that offered a few of her most indelible hooks". Ihnat also wrote that [...] "although less ethereal than 1998's Ray of Light, [...] is just as dance-floor ready [...] dance flute has never sounded so enticing, and Madonna's voice so sweetly seductive". AllMusic's Jose F. Promis listed the track [...] "as one of the singer's more memorable moments, coupling 1960s go-go rock with 1990s electronica, resulting in nothing less than a true slice of old fashioned rock & roll"; Promis also praised the two Calderone mixes.|$|E
