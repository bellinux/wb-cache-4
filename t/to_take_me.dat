He used <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> to see cowboy movies {{all the time when}} I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E

[...] In 2017, Brin later recalled: [...] "I came here to the US at age six with my family from the Soviet Union, which was at that time the greatest enemy the US had...

500|$|From 1969, Mosley {{was invited}} to {{represent}} March at the Grand Prix Constructors' Association (GPCA), which negotiated joint deals on behalf of its member teams. Although the new March organisation was not popular with the established teams, Mosley has said that [...] "when they went along to meetings to discuss things such as prize money, they felt they ought <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> along because I was a lawyer". He was unimpressed with the standard of negotiations: [...] "our side all went in a group because no-one trusted anyone else and all were afraid that someone would break ranks and make a private deal."

500|$|... "Dear Future Husband" [...] is a pop, doo-wop and R song {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of three minutes and four seconds. It opens {{with the sound}} of a stylus on a damaged vinyl before transcending into an old-fashioned ukulele melody. Musically, the track contains [...] "slick" [...] production and a rock-inspired drum beat, a [...] "zippy" [...] piano melody and [...] "ebullient" [...] brass instrumentation. In an interview with Popjustice's Peter Robinson, Trainor said: [...] "It's my lil' list of things he should probably be aware of if he wants to marry me.

500|$|... "D.S." [...] {{has very}} similar themes {{to the rest}} of HIStory. The album's content focuses on the hardships and public struggles Jackson went through just prior to its production. In the new jack swing/funk rock efforts [...] "Scream" [...] and [...] "Tabloid Junkie", along with the R ballad [...] "You Are Not Alone", Jackson retaliates against the {{injustice}} and isolation he feels, and directs much of his anger at the media. [...] "D.S." [...] contains an excerpt from the Yes hit single [...] "Owner of a Lonely Heart" [...] composed by Trevor Rabin, Jon Anderson, Chris Squire and Trevor Horn. The lyrics describe the subject of the song as a man who wants him [...] "dead or alive" [...] and [...] "really tried <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> down/By surprise". The track ends with the sound of a gunshot.|$|E
500|$|In November, it was {{announced}} that the band had signed a joint-venture deal with London-based indie label Cooking Vinyl. As part of the deal, the band would retain creative control over its artistic direction, with the band and label sharing profits equally after the label recouped costs associated with marketing, promotion and distribution. Ginger Fish, the band's drummer since 1995, quit in February 2011, explaining that he [...] "decided to step down as a member of Marilyn Manson and see where my life, and the knowledge of my availability cares <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me.</b> I can't stand by to watch opportunities pass me by simply because the knowledge of my availability wasn't clearly expressed by me."

500|$|Like its predecessor, {{the second}} {{deputation}} went on from England to continental Europe, visiting the Netherlands, France and Germany. In Paris, where the 1878 Exposition Universelle was in progress, Kruger saw a hot air balloon {{for the first}} time and readily took part in an ascent to view the city from above. [...] "High up in mid-air", he recalled, [...] "I jestingly asked the aeronaut, as we had gone so far, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> all the way home." [...] The pilot asked who Kruger was and, on their descent, gave him a medal [...] "to remind me of my journey through the air". The deputation composed a long reply to Hicks Beach, which was published as an open letter in the British press soon before they sailed for home on 24 October 1878. Unless the annexation were revoked, the letter stated, the Transvaal Boers would not co-operate regarding federation.|$|E

I kind of chanced into something." [...] He first appeared, at the age of seven, in a local independent film called Dark Side of the Street (1981), directed by a family friend. His biggest success as a child actor was as the star of the PBS children's series The Voyage of the Mimi (1984) and The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988), produced for sixth-grade science classes. Affleck worked [...] "sporadically" [...] on Mimi from the age of eight to fifteen in both Massachusetts and Mexico. As a teenager, he appeared in the ABC after school special Wanted: A Perfect Man (1986), the television film Hands of a Stranger (1987), and a 1989 Burger King commercial.|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{was never}} {{sure if she}} would finish her novel or {{if it would be}} published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, {{beginning}} at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together. Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not for the reader, [...] "clung to this method" [...] "because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [...] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do. But if I had known it was going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next." [...] Clarke and Greenland fell in love while she was writing the novel and moved in together.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the {{legitimate}} government had relocated to Iași, in besieged Moldavia. Late in 1916, it court-martialled Filitti in absentia, and {{sentenced him to}} death for the crime of high treason. By January 1918, the collapse of Russian forces on the Eastern Front led the Iași administration into negotiating a separate peace with the Central Powers. Germanophile Alexandru Marghiloman took over as Premier, in what seemed to spell a moral victory for the pro-German camp. However, Filitti was drawing closer to the more disgruntled Germanophiles, led by P. P. Carp, who wanted to sign peace on their own terms: [...] "I ask Carp, should he leave to negotiate for Romania, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> with him. He says that he'll take along his son. I note that one does not exclude the other. He agrees" [...] (January 12, 1918). Filitti was also upset that Marghiloman himself had not yet offered him a high diplomatic post during negotiations over the Buftea-Bucharest Peace Treaty, and noted that the Ententist King, Ferdinand I, [...] "made it hard" [...] {{for him to be}} accepted back into the diplomatic corps. As noted by Georgeta Filitti, Ferdinand vetoed successive proposals to rehire him as public servant.|$|E

500|$|After the April 10, 1967, {{recording}} session, the Experience {{spent the}} next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program Monday Monday and BBC2's Late Night Line-Up. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of Are You Experienced at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor's head of A, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a couple hours of sleep he prepared a suitable vinyl demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: [...] "As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking... when he hears this, he's going to order the men in white coats <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> away... Horst played the first side through and didn't say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was going to talk my way out of this. At {{the end of the second}} side, he just sat there. Finally, he said, 'This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I've ever heard.'" [...] Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{spent the}} next ten years working on the novel in her spare time, while editing cookbooks {{full-time}} for Simon & Schuster in Cambridge. She also published stories in Starlight 2 and Starlight 3; according to the New York Times Magazine, her work was known and appreciated by a small group of fantasy fans and critics on the internet. She was never sure, however, if she would finish her novel or if it would be published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, beginning at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together.

500|$|She {{moved into}} the teen-pop genre, as she felt that {{restyling}} herself to match the image of Spears and Aguilera would help remake her career. She separated from her then-boyfriend Nick Lachey, in March 2001, feeling the need to concentrate on her career. Her new image was promoted through appearances on many events, where Simpson wore revealing outfits. The development of this image coincided with the production and release of her second studio effort, Irresistible. Simpson said {{that she wanted to}} portray a [...] "sexier, more mature style" [...] in her new album. [...] "I recorded Sweet Kisses when I was 17 years old and I'm 21 [...] so there is four years of growth involved," [...] Simpson {{said in an interview with}} Coventry Newspapers in July 2001. In an interview with Cosmopolitan in June 2001, she explained, [...] "This record is about who I am now. The music is edgier, and I'm all grown up." [...] According to Terri Doughtery, author of People in the News: Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, Simpson hoped her new image would bring more attention to the power of her voice. [...] "It's not just me singing about being in love. I also have heartbreak songs and girls telling off guys songs. It's going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> a while to recoup [...] this album, because we spent a lot of money on it," [...] Simpson said to Entertainment Weekly.|$|E

500|$|While {{calling into}} WVEE during their {{interview}} with Ciara and Polow da Don, Hilson said, [...] "I {{just want to}} tell Ciara it’s not about you. People are just reading way too far into it. People take things and make it what they want it to be. It wasn’t taking shots at nobody." [...] I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara know that this is a true leak. I did, and I don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero." [...] Hilson went on to state she was not jealous of anyone's career, noting how all female R artists are the same, pointing out that [...] "Keyshia’s on my album. I’ve worked with Ciara many times. I’m a fan of Beyoncé’s." [...] When asked exactly who the song is about, Hilson said the targets knew who they were, responding, [...] "It’s anybody that ever tried <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> down and didn’t want to see me succeed. I’m not gonna call their names because I feel I’ve addressed it." [...] She further clarified, commenting [...] "I will say this, my journey has been 12 years long and there have been many people, specifically girls, and it really just isn't one person, it's been a lot of people." ...|$|E
