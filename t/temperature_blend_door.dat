40|$|Soymilk is {{a popular}} {{products}} manufactured with soybean. It is economical with great nourishment. However, large amounts of foam occurred in the paste milling and cooking processes during the manufacture of soymilk, and this would make kitchen dirty and cause wasting and inconvenient. Therefore, this problem {{whether there is a}} necessity to add antifoamer, silicon resin, in the production of market-sold soymilk deserves study. This research randomly sampled market-sold soymilk, and used atomic absorption spectroscopy to detect the content of silicon resin. On the other hand, Response surface methodology（RSM）was also used study process variables, such as soaking <b>temperature,</b> <b>blending</b> <b>temperature,</b> soaking time, and blending concentration, on the foaming of soymilk with different filtration treatments. 101 market-sold soymilk were to undergo atomic absorption spectroscopy determination. Si content was found to be randomly sampled high in 14 samples including 11 sweet soymilk and plain soymilk 3. For the sources, 11 samples were purchased from breakfast store, 3 form convenient store, manufactured by food processing plant. Preliminary test on the foaming of soymilk found: 1. soaking <b>temperature</b> 、 <b>blending</b> <b>temperature</b> related to foaming; 2. cloth-filtration soymilk possessed singnificantly less foaming compared to other filtration treatments. Effects of soaking <b>temperature,</b> <b>blending</b> <b>temperature,</b> soaking time on the foaming are as follows; 1. The significance of those three process variables was found to be blending temperature>soaking time>soaking temperature; 2. cloth-filtration soymilk foaming was affected by soaking <b>temperature,</b> <b>blending</b> <b>temperature</b> and soaking time, and least foaming 30 ℃soaking <b>temperature,</b> 30 ℃ <b>blending</b> <b>temperature,</b> and soaking was found at time 4 hrs. Besides, the significance of effects soaking <b>temperature,</b> <b>blending</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>blending</b> concentration are as follows: 1. the significance of those three process variables was found to be blending temperature>blending concentration >soaking temperature; 2. the net-filtration soymilk foaming was found to be least at 90 ℃ soaking temperature, 90 ℃blending temperature, and 6 times blending water addition; 3. cloth-filtration soymilk at 30 ℃ soaking <b>temperature,</b> 60 ℃ <b>blending</b> <b>temperature</b> and 8 times blending water addition was found to foam least. According to the results of this research, it was found that foaming reduced and foaming stability decreased with the increase of silicon resin addition. 豆奶(soymilk) 是一種大眾化的黃豆加工品，價格便宜，營養成分高，但是在加工過程中，會因磨漿或加熱煮沸而引起大量泡沫，因而污損廚具，或引起蒸煮的不順暢，及產品的浪費；因此，一般市售產品的加工過程中，是否常會添加有消泡劑─矽樹脂（silicon resin），便是本研究所欲探討的問題。本研究中逢機採樣市售豆奶，利用原子吸收光譜儀檢測矽之含量，以了解市售豆奶中消泡劑的添加情形。另一方面，本研究亦利用反應曲面法（RSM）探討浸泡溫度、研磨溫度、浸泡時間及研磨濃度等因子，對不同過濾方式之豆奶起泡情形的影響。 研究結果逢機取樣一○一件市售豆奶，經原子吸收光譜儀檢測發現，其中十四件矽含量偏高，十一件為甜味豆奶，三件為清漿(未調味) ；在購買來源方面，十一件購自早餐店，三件購於便利商店，其來源為食品工廠製造。對豆奶起泡性預備試驗探討所得結果發現： 1. 浸泡黃豆溫度、研磨溫度與起泡量有關。 2. 三種過濾方式（未過濾、過濾網、過濾布）起泡量比較，以過濾布濾得之豆奶，其起泡量均有明顯下降。另以不同之浸泡黃豆溫度、研磨溫度及浸泡時間對豆奶起泡性之相關性結果為： 1. 三個操作因子對豆奶起泡之影響力為：硏磨溫度>浸泡時間>浸泡溫度。 2. 浸泡溫度、研磨溫度、浸泡時間等三個操作因子的確對布過濾所得之豆奶樣品起泡量有密切的相關性，於 30 ℃浸泡溫度、 30 ℃研磨溫度及 4 小時的浸泡時間起泡量最少。此外浸泡黃豆溫度、研磨溫度及研磨濃度對豆奶起泡性之影響為： 1. 三個操作因子對三種過濾方式濾得豆奶起泡之影響力為：硏磨溫度>硏磨濃度>浸泡溫度。 2. 網過濾豆奶，於 90 ℃浸泡溫度、 90 ℃研磨溫度及 6 倍水研磨黃豆時起泡量最少。 3. 布過濾豆奶，於 30 ℃浸泡溫度、 60 ℃研磨溫度及 8 倍水研磨黃豆時起泡量最少。由試驗發現隨著矽樹脂添加量增加，豆奶起泡量減少，且泡沫呈現不穩定情形。目錄 頁次 壹、前言 ……………………………………………………………… 1 貳、文獻整理 ………………………………………………………… 2 一、豆奶 …………………………………………………………… 2 （一）豆奶的營養成分 ……………………………………………… 2 （二）豆奶的製造 …………………………………………………… 6 （三）起泡 …………………………………………………………… 8 （四）消泡方法 ……………………………………………………… 9 （五）矽樹脂 ………………………………………………………… 11 二、反應曲面法 ……………………………………………………… 13 三、原子吸收光譜分析 ……………………………………………… 20 參、研究目的 ………………………………………………………… 27 肆、材料與方法 ……………………………………………………… 28 一、市售豆奶產品中的消泡劑含量 ………………………………… 28 （一）試驗材料 ……………………………………………………… 28 （二）試驗方法 ……………………………………………………… 29 1. 試驗設計 ……………………………………………………… 29 2. 樣品製備 ……………………………………………………… 29 3. 矽含量測定 …………………………………………………… 32 二、不同條件因子對豆奶起泡性之影響 …………………………… 34 （一) 試驗材料 ……………………………………………………… 34 （二) 試驗方法 ……………………………………………………… 34 1. 預備試驗 ……………………………………………………… 34 2. 試驗設計 ……………………………………………………… 35 3. 樣品製備 ……………………………………………………… 35 4. 測定項目 ……………………………………………………… 38 5. 反應曲面法統計分析…………………………………………… 41 三、添加矽樹脂之豆奶起泡性與泡沫安定性探討 ……………… 41 伍、結果與討論 ……………………………………………………… 44 一、原子吸收光譜分析結果的探討 ………………………………… 44 （一）採樣分析 ……………………………………………………… 44 （二）豆奶標準品矽（si）含量 …………………………………… 51 （三）分析結果 ……………………………………………………… 52 二、不同條件因子對豆奶起泡性影響的探討 ……………………… 53 (一）預備試驗 ……………………………………………………… 53 (二）起泡量分析 …………………………………………………… 59 1. 浸泡溫度、研磨溫度、浸泡時間的影響 …………………… 59 2. 浸泡溫度、研磨溫度、研磨濃度的影響 …………………… 71 三、添加矽樹脂之豆奶起泡性與泡沫安定性探討 ……………… 83 陸、結論 ……………………………………………………………… 87 柒、中文摘要 ………………………………………………………… 90 捌、英文摘要 ………………………………………………………… 92 玖、參考文獻 ………………………………………………………… 94 圖表目錄 表次 頁次 表一 豆奶的營養成分………………………………………………… 4 表二 豆奶、牛奶與母奶的營養比較………………………………… 5 表三 傳統試驗與RSM試驗所需點數之比較…………………………… 17 表四 反應曲面分析之三變數、三層階試驗設計…………………… 18 表五 常用於原子吸收光譜分析的燃燒劑…………………………… 24 表六 製備添加不等量矽樹脂之豆奶標準品………………………… 33 表七 豆奶試驗的三因子（浸泡溫度、研磨溫度、浸泡時間） 三層階反應曲面設計中之操作條件變數及其階層 …………… 36 表八 豆奶試驗的三因子（浸泡溫度、研磨溫度、研磨濃度） 三層階反應曲面設計中之操作條件變數及其階層…………… 37 表九 豆奶樣品添加矽樹脂量表……………………………………… 43 表十 市售豆奶樣品取樣一覽表……………………………………… 45 表十一 豆奶標準品之Si含量測定結果……………………………… 52 表十二 浸泡溫度、研磨溫度、浸泡時間對不同過濾方式 豆奶起泡量(ml）之數據…………………………………… 60 表十三 不同過濾方式豆奶起泡性的反應曲面回歸模式之變方分析 61 表十四 不同之過濾方式豆奶製作時之條件因子（浸泡溫度、研磨溫度 、浸泡時間）對起泡性之整體總合作用的變方分析……… 62 表十五 不同之過濾方式豆奶起泡性與加工條件因子（浸泡溫度、 研磨溫度、浸泡時間）間二次多項式之回歸係數………… 63 表十六 浸泡溫度、研磨溫度、研磨濃度對不同過濾方式 豆奶起泡量(ml）之數據……………………………………… 73 表十七 不同過濾方式豆奶起泡性的反應曲面回歸模式之變方分析… 74 表十八 不同倍數之豆奶研磨水豆奶製作時之條件因子（浸泡溫度、 研磨溫度研磨濃度）對起泡性之整體總合作用的變方分析… 75 表十九 不同之過濾方式豆奶起泡性與加工條件因子（浸泡溫度、 研磨溫度、研磨濃度）間二次多項式之回歸係數…………… 76 表二十 矽樹脂添加對豆奶起泡量與泡沫不穩定性之影響…………… 84 圖次 頁次 圖一 傳統中式豆奶製造流程…………………………………………… 8 圖二 消泡劑的消泡作用機制…………………………………………… 12 圖三 反應曲面法的步驟流程…………………………………………… 15 圖四 原子吸收光譜儀的構造…………………………………………… 23 圖五 原子吸收光譜儀測定礦物質的操作流程………………………… 26 圖六 市售豆奶矽樹脂含量測定樣品之製備流程……………………… 30 圖七 豆奶起泡性測定樣品之製備……………………………………… 38 圖八 泡沫測定裝置……………………………………………………… 40 圖九 執行反應曲面回歸之SAS程式…………………………………… 42 圖十 市售豆奶取樣來源分析…………………………………………… 48 圖十一 市售豆奶取樣地區分析………………………………………… 49 圖十二 市售豆奶取樣種類分析………………………………………… 50 圖十三 25 ℃水浸泡黃豆時之起泡情形………………………………… 54 圖十四 50 ℃水浸泡黃豆時之起泡情形………………………………… 55 圖十五 70 ℃水浸泡黃豆時之起泡情形………………………………… 56 圖十六 85 ℃水浸泡黃豆時之起泡情形………………………………… 57 圖十七 100 ℃水浸泡黃豆時起泡情形………………………………… 58 圖十八 在固定浸泡溫度下研磨溫度和浸泡時間對未過濾豆奶 起泡量之等性狀曲線圖……………………………………… 68 圖十九 在固定浸泡溫度下研磨溫度和浸泡時間對網過濾豆奶 起泡量之等性狀曲線圖……………………………………… 69 圖二十 在固定浸泡溫度下研磨溫度和浸泡時間對布過濾豆奶 起泡量之等性狀曲線圖……………………………………… 70 圖二十一 在固定浸泡溫度下研磨溫度和研磨濃度對未過濾豆奶 起泡量之等性狀曲線圖……………………………………… 80 圖二十二 在固定浸泡溫度下研磨溫度和研磨濃度對網過濾豆奶 起泡量之等性狀曲圖……………………………………… 81 圖二十三 在固定浸泡溫度下研磨溫度和研磨濃度對布過濾豆奶 起泡量之等性狀曲線圖……………………………………… 82 圖二十四 矽樹脂添加量對豆奶起泡量之影響………………………… 85 圖二十五 矽樹脂添加量對豆奶泡沫不穩定性之影響………………… 8...|$|R

Alternative {{energy sources}} are needed {{if the current}} use of energy is to be {{sustained}} while reducing global warming. A possible alternative energy source that has significant potential is hydrogen. For hydrogen to become a serious contender for replacing fossil fuels, the production thereof has to be further investigated. One such process, the membrane–based Hybrid Sulphur (HyS) process, where hydrogen is produced from the electrolysis of SO 2, has received considerable interest recently. Since H 2 SO 4 is formed during SO 2 electrolysis, H 2 SO 4 stability {{is a prerequisite for}} any membrane to be used in this process. In this study, pure as well as high and low <b>temperature</b> <b>blended</b> polybenzimidazole (PBI), partially fluorinated poly(arylene ether) (sFS) and nonfluorinated poly(arylene ethersulphone) (sPSU) membranes were investigated in terms of their acid stability as a function of acid concentration by treating them in H 2 SO 4 (30, 60 and 90 wt%) for 120 h at 1 bar pressure. The high <b>temperature</b> <b>blend</b> membranes contain the basic polymer in excess (70 wt% basic PBI and 30 wt% acid sPSU/sFS polymer) and require acid doping in order to conduct protons. In the doped state they are able to conduct protons up to 200 °C. The low <b>temperature</b> <b>blend</b> membranes are also composed of the same PBI polymer used in the high temperature membranes, as well as the same acidic polymers with one of the membranes containing a fluorinated polymer and the other a nonfluorinated polymer (sFS or sPSU) in excess. These membranes do not require any acid doping to conduct protons but they are only stable at temperatures below 80 °C. High <b>temperature</b> <b>blend</b> membranes were characterised using through–plane conductivity, GPC and IEC, whilst low temperature membranes were characterised using in–plane and through–plane proton conductivity, weight change, TGA, GPC, SEM, EDX and IEC techniques. The conductivity determination techniques (especially the in–plane technique) proved to be cumbersome, whilst all the other analysis techniques were deemed appropriate. H 2 SO 4 exposure had a destabilising effect on the PBI membrane which presented as weight gain at the 30 and 60 wt% H 2 SO 4 concentrations due to salt formation and dissolution at the 90 wt% acid treatment due to sulphonation. In the sFS membrane dissolution was observed at 30 and 60 wt% as a result of oligomer loss that occurred during the post treatment washing process and partial dissolution, as a result of sulphonation, at the 90 wt% treated membrane. The sPSU membrane showed great stability at 30 and 60 wt%, though dissolution was observed at 90 wt% because of membrane sulphonation {{due to a lack of}} fluorination. The sFS–PBI membrane blend proved to be stable with only slight degradation taking place at 90 wt% treatment due to sulphonation. Similarly the sPSU–PBI blend membrane showed great stability at the 30 and 60 wt% H 2 SO 4 treatment concentrations however total dissolution occurred at 90 wt% treatment again due to a lack of fluorination. Although both the low <b>temperature</b> <b>blended</b> membranes showed superb stability to H 2 SO 4 concentrations expected in the SO 2 electrolyser (30 – 40 wt%), the low <b>temperature</b> <b>blended</b> sFS–PBI membrane seemed slightly more stable over the H 2 SO 4 treatment concentration range (30 – 90 wt%), due to the protective role of the fluorinated polymer. The superior acid stability of this membrane could prove vital for proper SO 2 electrolysis, especially for prolonged periods of operationMaster...|$|R

40|$|The high <b>temperature</b> <b>blending</b> {{of wheat}} gluten with other {{polymers}} for the manufacturing of bioplastics {{is associated with}} heat induced cross-linking reactions which can increase the viscosity and affect com- ponent miscibility. This work showed that a good level {{of control over the}} onset of cross-linking can be obtained during heating by adjusting the pH of the environment. Gluten was heated (> 100 °C) in buffer solutions of different pH and protein polymerisation was monitored by various methods to assess the extent and nature of aggregation. In a sufficiently acidic environment (pH 2. 5 – 3. 0) during heating up to 153 °C, cross-linking was greatly hindered whilst protein degradation was not observed, provided 15 min heating time was not exceeded. Such conditions may well be suited to blend gluten with other polymers at relatively high temperatures in aqueous solvent. When hydrothermally treated gluten samples with large differences in protein cross-linking were compression moulded to produce plastic specimens, little differences in mechanical properties were observed. status: publishe...|$|R

As RCCI is sensitive for operating conditions, closed-loop control is a crucial enabler for stable and robust combustion. The feedback design is complex due to the coupling between inputs, such as intake manifold <b>temperature,</b> <b>blend</b> ratio (BR), and air-to-fuel ratio (ƛ), and, on the other hand, combustion parameters. Contrary to earlier, parallel SISO approaches, a multivariable feedback control strategy is applied, which uses a new combination of control parameters. Following the linearisation of a validated multi-zone RCCI combustion model, a MIMO feedback control strategy is designed. This cycle-to-cycle control strategy uses diesel injection timing, diesel fuel quantity, and natural gas (NG) fuel quantity information to track the desired engine load, ignition delay, and a new control parameter: BR.

There is an evident inter-annual variability of cold wave duration, showing a significant increase particularly in some forest belt locations in the Southern Carpathians. However, the long-term variability trend (83 years) at Omu Peak alpine station showed quite an opposite trend, corresponding to the warming process in terms of minimum temperature values.

40|$|Abstract [...] Due to the {{increase}} in cost and scarcity of petroleum resources have promoted research in alternative fuels for internal combustion engines. Among various possible options, fuels derived from triglycerides (vegetable oils/animal fats) are promising for substitutes of fossil diesel fuels. Vegetable oil poses some problems when subjected to prolonged usage in compression ignition engines because of high viscosity as reported by different researchers. The research on alternative fuels for compression ignition engine has become essential due to depletion of petroleum products and its major contribution for pollutants, where vegetable oil promises best alternative fuel. Vegetable oils, due to their agricultural origin, are able to reduce net CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere. But major disadvantage of vegetable oil is its viscosity, which is higher than that of mineral diesel. Hence neat vegetable oil does not give better performance.

40|$|Abstract: Specific {{capacity}} and thermal conductivity {{are two very}} important physical quantities that characterize the heat performance of heat storage material. This paper measured the specific capacities and thermal conductivities of binary systems formed by NPG, TRIS and PE in the temperature range from 30 ℃ to 70 ℃ and analyzed the experimental results {{from the point of}} view of crystal vibration. Hydrogen bonds exert great influence on the thermophysical properties of the binary systems. Although the components are only simply blended, substitutional impurity defects are incurred. As a result hydrogen bond will be affected in a complex way. There is no uniform trend between the value of x and specific capacity. Because of the influence of structure defect, specific {{capacity and}} phonon speed which all change with the strength of hydrogen bond, the relationship between thermal conductivity and the value of x is non-linear too. Because 40 ℃ is near the phase transition temperature of NPGxTRIS 1 -x (x= 0. 618), its specific capacity at 40 ℃ decreases and thermal conductivity increases. Because hydrogen bond changes with temperature, specific capacity of PExTRIS 1 -x (x= 0. 618) rises. Since 60 ℃ is near the phase transition temperature, its specific capacity at 60 ℃ falls. PExTRIS 1 -x (x= 0. 618) shows smaller thermal conductivities at temperatures higher than 30 ℃. This is because the hydrogen bonds become weaker with <b>temperature.</b> <b>Blending</b> impurities possessing longer mean free path with polyalcohol can change the thermal conductivity...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} aimed on {{improving}} the toughness of phenolic resin using liquid rubber, Hydroxyl terminated Polybutadiene (HTPB) for aerospace & commercial application. HTPB being chemically inert with Novolac, was blended with Resole. 80 / 20 blend of Novolac and Resole {{was selected for}} toughness improvement studies taking in to account the blend's processability and glass transition <b>temperature.</b> This <b>blend</b> was modified with in different weight fractions of HTPB elastomer. Toughness was studied both in bulk phenolic castings and in woven-glass fabric reinforced composites.

The physico-chemical properties of the biodiesel produced were compared to the conventional light atmospheric gas oil (LAGO) which is commercially used as fuel in diesel engines. Result showed that supercritical trans-esterification method could be used for the production of biodiesel from sheanut oil.

40|$|A {{derivative}} of 2 -methylindole, namely 3 -[2 -(4 -nitrophenyl) ethenyl]- 1 -(2 -ethylhexyl) - 2 -metylindole (NPEMI-E) has been synthesized. Materials obtained from this molecule {{have been studied}} as thin films between two ITO layers. The study revealed that NPEMI-E collects in itself both photoconductivity and NLO characteristics. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements showed the formation of stable glass films characterized by a T-g temperature lower than room <b>temperature.</b> <b>Blends</b> with the photoconductive poly-N-vinyl- 2, 3 -dimethylindole (PVDMI) were also studied, giving again stable glass films independently of the wt. % contents of NPEMI-E. Photorefractivity measurements on both pure and blended NPEMI-E allowed to measure a value of the optical gain Gamma = 627 cm(- 1) at an applied electric field E = 60 V/mu m. This high value of F corresponds to a sharp maximum of the experimental trend of Gamma {{as a function of}} the wt. % content of NPEMI-E. The corresponding content was wt. % = 91. 5. The presence of this maximum induced us to make the hypothesis that, besides the well known reorientational contribution to the photorefractivity, a further mechanism (recently theoretically studied) is active in our blends. This mechanism arises in the interactions among the NLO polarized and polarizable moieties (cooperative effect). It can produce a rapid variation of some of the electrooptical parameters conditioning the extent of the photorefractivity. This can happen at a well defined mean intermolecular distance and hence at a well defined concentration of the NLO molecule...|$|R
40|$|Slag {{viscosity}} as {{a function}} of temperature and composition is a very important factor in determining the operating <b>temperature,</b> <b>blended</b> coals as well as fluxing agents for slagging gasification. A number of models for predicting the viscosity of fuel slags have been developed, however, most of them are only valid in a limited range of temperatures and compositions. This study aims at developing a new viscosity model for fully liquid slag systems in the Newtonian range, based on the thermodynamic modified associate species model. The viscosity model is a structurally-based model, which gives a reliable prediction over the whole range of compositions and a broad range of temperatures. The focus of the present paper is to collect and model the experimental data for pure oxides SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, CaO, MgO, Na 2 O, K 2 O and binary systems SiO 2 –Al 2 O 3, SiO 2 –CaO, SiO 2 –MgO, SiO 2 –Na 2 O, SiO 2 –K 2 O, Al 2 O 3 –CaO, Al 2 O 3 –MgO, Al 2 O 3 –Na 2 O, Al 2 O 3 –K 2 O, which is the first step to develop a new viscosity model for the system SiO 2 –Al 2 O 3 –CaO–MgO–Na 2 O–K 2 O. A good agreement between experimental data and calculated data has been achieved using only one set of model parameters, which have a clear physico-chemical meaning. Moreover, the extrapolated viscosities to the regions where no experimental data are available in literature are reasonable...|$|R
50|$|Gas {{mixtures}} {{are usually}} specified {{in terms of}} molar gas fraction (which is closely approximated by volumetric gas fraction for many permanent gases): by percentage, parts per thousand or parts per million. Volumetric gas fraction converts trivially to partial pressure ratio, following Dalton's law of partial pressures. Partial pressure <b>blending</b> at constant <b>temperature</b> is computationally simple, and pressure measurement is relatively inexpensive, but maintaining constant temperature during pressure changes requires significant delays for <b>temperature</b> equalization. <b>Blending</b> by mass fraction is unaffected by temperature variation during the process, but requires accurate measurement of mass or weight, and calculation of constituent masses from the specified molar ratio. Both partial pressure and mass fraction blending are used in practice.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{samples were}} {{modified}} by using chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) {{to increase the}} toughness and using dioctyl phthalate (DOP) to increase the plasticity. The tensile strength and breaking elongation of the samples were studied by changing the chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) and dioctyl phthalate (DOP) contents and the hot-pressing temperature. It was shown by the test results that, {{with the increase of}} chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) and dioctyl phthalate (DOP) contents, the tensile strength of the samples was decreased while the breaking elongation was increased. By increasing the hot-pressing <b>temperature,</b> the <b>blending</b> effect between polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) as well as the mechanical performance of the samples were increased, however, over-high hot-pressing temperature would result in plasticizer precipitation...|$|R

As the seasons and temperature change, the background color is undergoing tremendous changes. To solve this problem, {{a new kind}} of intelligent camouflage coating was invented whose color changes with the <b>temperature</b> and <b>blends</b> with the background. Through orthogonal design and experiments, the composition of raw materials and mixture ratio has been determined. The physical and chemical performances of the coating such as drying time and color-changing temperature have been tested. The result shows that the coating has good coating effect, excellent mechanical and chemical performance which can meet the camouflage requirements of changing seasons...|$|R

40|$|Blends {{consisting}} of a systematic compositional series of Sago Starch (SS) and chitosan (CS) were studied by using a Brookfield Digital Viscometer Model DV-II Version 2. 0. The viscosity of pure SS, pure CS and SS/CS blends was measured over the temperature range 30 - 130 °C. Results on the SS/CS blends indicate that the viscosity decreases with temperature and SS content for a fixed speed. At lower SS content, the decrease of viscosity with temperature is more pronounced. This indicates that blends with higher CS content are more affected by <b>temperature</b> changes. <b>Blend</b> containing 50 %CS was superior compared to other blends and {{this finding is consistent}} with earlier works on compatibility studies of polypropylene/sago starch blend using Dynamical Mechanical Thermal Analyzer (DMTA) ...|$|R
