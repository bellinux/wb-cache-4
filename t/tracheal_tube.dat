5|$|For {{infants and}} young children, orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier than}} the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube. As with adults, {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children. Confirmation of proper position of the <b>tracheal</b> <b>tube</b> is accomplished as with adult patients.|$|E
5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the <b>tracheal</b> <b>tube</b> is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E

30|$|Discussion Our {{study is}} {{sufficiently}} powered {{to detect a}} significant difference in microaspiration of gastric contents between patients intubated with conical-cuffed <b>tracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> and standard-cuffed <b>tracheal</b> <b>tubes.</b> One of the strengths of this study is the use of quantitative measurement of pepsin as a marker of microaspiration.|$|R
5|$|Complications {{may also}} be severe and {{long-lasting}} or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess, bronchial intubation, or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as laryngospasm and negative pressure pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal intubation, or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of the <b>tracheal</b> <b>tube.</b> Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation and/or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate fistula) or esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula). Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea. The cuff pressure is monitored carefully {{in order to avoid}} complications from over-inflation, many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting the blood supply to the tracheal mucosa. A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10–15% and procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States.|$|E

25|$|As all techniques, cricoid {{pressure}} has indications, contraindications and side effects. It {{is associated with}} nausea/vomiting and it may cause esophageal rupture and also may make tracheal intubation and mask ventilation difficult or impossible. Cricoid force greater than 40 N can compromise airway patency and make tracheal intubation difficult. Cricoid pressure may displace the esophagus, make ventilation with a facemask or with an laryngeal mask airway (LMA) more difficult, interfere with LMA placement and advancement of a <b>tracheal</b> <b>tube</b> and alter laryngeal visualization by a flexible bronchoscope. However, other investigators have found that cricoid pressure does not increase the rate of failed intubation.|$|E
25|$|The {{respiratory}} tube {{is also known}} in LACM 128319, preserved as cartilaginous tracheal rings.

The section where the two bronchi split was also preserved in the specimen, but was destroyed during excavation. This is an indication that Platecarpus and other mosasaurs had two functional lungs. Snakes, which are closely related to mosasaurs, have only one functional lung with the second often being vestigial or absent. Unlike terrestrial lizards, however, the bronchi separate in front of the area of the forelimbs rather than at the level of the limbs.|$|E

Zin Modelling {{the mechanical}} effects of <b>tracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> in normal subjects. P. R. M. Rocco, W. A. Zin. ERS Journals Ltd 1995. ABSTRACT: The addition of <b>tracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> to the respiratory system contributes an extra mechanical burden {{in terms of}} pressure necessary to overcome its own resistance. On the basis of experimental data from the literature and on a previously reported mathematical model of the inspirogram, we wished to study predictions of press-ures, volume, flow and work of breathing during the use of <b>tracheal</b> <b>tubes.</b> The present investigation indicates that: 1) the loss in volume is greater {{at the beginning of}} inspiration and with narrower tubes; 2) in order to preserve tidal volume the inspiratory drive must be increased at any time during inspiration with the use of diminishing internal diameter of the tubes; 3) alternatively, tidal volume can be maintained by increasing inspiratory duration; and 4) the addition of tubes with internal diameter of 9 mm (no. 9) and 8 mm (no. 8) increases the total resistive work by 115 and 154 %, respectively, whilst total elastic work decreases 9 and 16 % in relation to the nonintubated patient. These findings are consequent to the turbulent flow pattern that normally occ-urs within the <b>tracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> and connectors themselves. We believe they are rele-vant to the physician confronted with a patient needing tracheal intubation...|$|R
30|$|Using a manikin, we {{compared}} extraction forces between PVC and Sn stylets under four different conditions: without lubricant, 3  ml of water (water), three sprays of 8  % lidocaine (lidocaine), and olive oil.

The extraction force was significantly smaller with the Sn stylet compared to the PVC stylet, regardless of the lubricant used for all three <b>tracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> with different diameters tested (P <  0.05). In comparisons by lubricant, lidocaine and olive oil resulted in significantly lower extraction forces than with no lubricant or water with the PVC stylet for all <b>tracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> tested.

25|$|Also in 1913, Henry H. Janeway (1873–1921) {{published}} results he {{had achieved}} using a laryngoscope {{he had recently}} developed. An American anesthesiologist practicing at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, Janeway was {{of the opinion that}} direct intratracheal insufflation of volatile anesthetics would provide improved conditions for otolaryngologic surgery. With this in mind, he developed a laryngoscope designed {{for the sole purpose of}} tracheal intubation. Similar to Jackson's device, Janeway's instrument incorporated a distal light source. Unique however was the inclusion of batteries within the handle, a central notch in the blade for maintaining the <b>tracheal</b> <b>tube</b> in the midline of the oropharynx during intubation and a slight curve to the distal tip of the blade to help guide the tube through the glottis. The success of this design led to its subsequent use in other types of surgery. Janeway was thus instrumental in popularizing the widespread use of direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in the practice of anesthesiology.|$|E
500|$|The Eschmann <b>tracheal</b> <b>tube</b> {{introducer}} (often incorrectly {{referred to}} as a [...] "gum elastic bougie") is specialized type of stylet used to facilitate difficult intubation.

Unlike a traditional intubating stylet, the Eschmann <b>tracheal</b> <b>tube</b> introducer is typically inserted directly into the trachea and then used as a guide over which the endotracheal tube can be passed (in a manner analogous to the Seldinger technique). As the Eschmann <b>tracheal</b> <b>tube</b> introducer is considerably less rigid than a conventional stylet, this technique {{is considered to be a}} relatively atraumatic means of tracheal intubation.|$|E
500|$|Ideally, {{at least}} one of the methods {{utilized}} for confirming <b>tracheal</b> <b>tube</b> placement will be a measuring instrument.

40|$|Background. Previous {{studies have}} {{identified}} no {{strong correlation between}} patients' height and tracheal length in anaesthetized patients.

Methods. We measured VCD in 130 anaesthetized Chinese patients with a fibreoptic bronchoscope.

500|$|A <b>tracheal</b> <b>tube</b> is a {{catheter}} that is {{inserted into the}} trachea for {{the primary purpose of}} establishing and maintaining a patent (open and unobstructed) airway. Tracheal tubes are frequently used for airway management in the settings of general anesthesia, critical care, mechanical ventilation and emergency medicine. Many different types of tracheal tubes are available, suited for different specific applications. An endotracheal tube is a specific type of <b>tracheal</b> <b>tube</b> that is nearly always inserted through the mouth (orotracheal) or nose (nasotracheal). It is a breathing conduit designed to be placed into the airway of critically injured, ill or anesthetized patients in order to perform mechanical positive pressure ventilation of the lungs and to prevent the possibility of aspiration or airway obstruction. The endotracheal tube has a fitting designed to be connected to a source of pressurized gas such as oxygen. At the other end is an orifice through which such gases are directed into the lungs and may also include a balloon (referred to as a cuff). The tip of the endotracheal tube is positioned above the carina (before the trachea divides to each lung) and sealed within the trachea so that the lungs can be ventilated equally. A tracheostomy tube is another type of tracheal tube; this [...] curved metal or plastic tube is inserted into a tracheostomy stoma or a cricothyrotomy incision.|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate adequacy of the design of readily available paediatric cuffed <b>tracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> (CPTT). Methods. In 15 series of cuffed (11) and uncuffed (four) paediatric <b>tracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> (ID: 2. 5 - 7. 0 mm) from four different manufacturers the following dimensions were measured: outer diameter of the tube, position and largest diameter of the tube cuff inflated at 20 cm H 2 O and position of depth markings and compared with age‐related dimensions. Results. Outer diameters for tubes with similar IDs varied markedly between manufacturers and between cuffed and uncuffed <b>tracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> from the same manufacturer. Cuff diameters at 20 cm H 2 O cuff pressure and cross‐sectional cuff area at 20 cm H 2 O cuff pressure did not always cover maximal internal age‐related tracheal diameters and cross‐sectional areas. Placing the tube tip in the mid‐trachea, the cuffs of cuffed tubes with ID 3. 0, 4. 0, or 5. 0 mm would become positioned within the larynx. If the cuffs were placed 1 cm below the cricoid level, many of the tube tips would be dangerously deep within the trachea. Only five of the 11 cuffed tubes had a depth marking. In many of these tubes the distances from depth marking to tube tip were greater than the age‐related minimal tracheal length. Conclusion. Most cuffed paediatric <b>tracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> are poorly designed, in particular the smaller sizes. A better design of cuffed tubes with a short high‐volume, low‐pressure cuff, cuff‐free subglottic space and adequately placed depth markings are urgently needed. Br J Anaesth 2004; 92 : 78 - 8...|$|R
