That racetrack is a crown jewel of Wilkes County [...] [...] [...] [...] <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>catalyst</b> for bringing in new business and jobs to Wilkes." [...] The petition asked county commissioners to condemn the Speedway and, through power of eminent domain, sell to an investor that would repurpose the facility for auto racing. There were 3,313 signatures on the petition. However, county officials decided condemnation of the property was not the best option.|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, Wesley {{is found}} {{bleeding}} {{to death in a}} park and is taken to a hospital where Angel then attempts to smother him to death. Although he fails to do so he tells Wesley that if he ever sees him again he will kill him for the part he played in Connor's abduction. When Cordelia returns from holiday she is angry at the gang for not informing her of the events that transpired after she left and hurt that they wouldn't immediately call her back after things began to spiral out of control. Meanwhile, Gunn and Fred hit a snag in their relationship when an old acquaintance comes to collect Gunn's indebted soul. The gang use <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>catalyst</b> to re-shape their team and get back on track with the Fred/Gunn romance strengthened because of it. As Angel, Inc. begin to rebuild their lives Wesley is busy being continuously ensnared by Wolfram & Hart. Now holding onto a dark and cynical outlook to life, Wesley is approached by Lilah who infiltrates his life and ends up having sex with him. Wesley refuses to join her company however.After the Hyperion Hotel is infested by inter-dimensional, insect like demons (and subsequently cleansed by Cordelia's newfound, angelic powers) a portal to the Quor'toth is created through which Connor re-appears, now eighteen years old and back on Earth to kill Angel for what he did to Holtz' family. Meanwhile, Holtz comes back through the portal as well and tells Connor that he should be with his father claiming to have no taste for vengeance anymore. This, however, is Holtz' final revenge after he has Justine kill him {{in the manner of a}} vampire and blames it on Angel. While Connor infiltrates Angel Investigations to lure them into a false sense of security, Angel believes everything in his life is finally starting to go well. Cordelia is halted by a spirit guide who tells her that she no longer belongs on Earth and instead has been called to a Higher Plane. Meanwhile, Connor attacks Angel on the beach and uses a stun gun to incapacitate him. With the help of Justine, he traps Angel in a crate and sinks him to the bottom of the ocean. After this night, Angel Investigations is left shattered; Cordelia is in a heavenly dimension, Lorne has moved on to Las Vegas, the Groosalugg left Cordelia, Connor betrayed his father and Angel was sent to the bottom of the sea. Fred and Gunn are the only members of the group left, curious as to where everyone has gone.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{discussion}} from an economist’s {{perspective of the}} concept of business systems. This concept has recently been proposed by Richard Whitley as a means of conceptualizing the close connections between dominant social institutions and ways of coordinating economic activities as well as the interrelations between firms and market characteristics. The paper discusses to which extent economics is helpful for the understanding of business systems. Moreover, the paper uses <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>catalyst</b> for a broader discussion of the economics and sociology connection. The main argument is that while economics is helpful for understanding certain aspects of business systems, the path-dependent, complementary and contextdependent features of business systems are hard to grasp with economic tools to the extent that these features have cognitive and normative elements. In general, economics has a problem with the cognitive and normative aspects of institutions, which are merely treated as side-constraints on action. However, these aspects may be crucial for understanding processes of path-creation and dependence (for example, in business systems), and therefore ultimate allocations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} notion of ‘voice’ in {{relation}} to contemporary poetics and the digital arts. It is a practice-based project that produces a theoretical and creative space in which a theory of the ‘voice of the machine’ is discovered and tested. Through a series of research chapters and critical reflections this thesis tests ideas of dictation, translation, inscription and embodiment using the poetic device of the disembodied — or acousmatic — voice as a fundamental theoretical framework, which in turn informs my practice. I begin with a study of Jack Spicer’s book After Lorca, a collection of translated poems that are dictated to Spicer by the ghost of Federico García Lorca. Using the work of Mladen Dolar, I explore {{the idea of the}} acousmatic voice and the processes of translation that emerge from this when one is in communion with the dead. From this I identify a ‘network of tradition’: Spicer’s matrix of historical, poetic associations to which belongs W. B. Yeats, another poet who used spirit dictation in composition. I focus on the practice of Yeats’s wife, George, who, acting as a medium, produced hundreds of manuscripts of automatic writing and drawing. Through a study of Johanna Drucker’s notion of graphesis, via discussions on choreography, I establish George Yeats as a spiritual writing machine whose practice works as an acoustic register of ghostly dictation and audition. I consider the idea of katabasis — an Orphic descent to retrieve a voice — that underpins Spicer’s poetics in After Lorca and I use <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>catalyst</b> to enact gestures of archival katabasis — in pursuit of George Yeats — and what I term as the kata_BASIC, which is a descent into the machine to retrieve its voice. Using the random-chance poetics of Jackson Mac Low as a practice methodology I understand the voice of the machine to be an expression of its agency and computational processes, which are materialised in machine-mediated interventions such as the glitch. The practice I produce in this project — poetry, objects, video and sound — tests ideas of translation, acoustic imagery, hybridity and transcreation in light of the idea of a shared voice of collaboration that exists between the machine and the archived or disembodied voices that it (re) mediates...|$|E

40|$|Non-precious oxygen {{reduction}} reaction (ORR) catalysts {{could help}} {{reduce the cost of}} future generations of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEFCs). One class of Pt-free catalysts for PEFCs are nanostructured Fe/C/N-based materials. In these, the nature of the active site is still hotly contested. Resolving this issue could lead to the development of better catalysts. One approach to achieve this is to study nitrogen-doped carbons which do not contain any Fe. Such materials have been studied, but largely in alkaline media where high activity is obtained. To truly understand the ORR mechanism of Fe/C/N-based catalysts, measurements in acid media are required to simulate the activity in proton-based PEFC systems.
