50|$|The DNA <b>template</b> <b>labeled</b> at the 3' or 5' end, {{depending}} on {{the location of the}} binding site(s). Labels that can be used are: radioactivity and fluorescence. Radioactivity has been traditionally used to label DNA fragments for footprinting analysis, as the method was originally developed from the Maxam-Gilbert chemical sequencing technique. Radioactive labeling is very sensitive and is optimal for visualizing small amounts of DNA. Fluorescence is a desirable advancement due to the hazards of using radio-chemicals. However, it has been more difficult to optimize because it is not always sensitive enough to detect the low concentrations of the target DNA strands used in DNA footprinting experiments. Electrophoretic sequencing gels or capillary electrophoresis have been successful in analyzing footprinting of fluorescent tagged fragments.|$|R

Do-It-Yourself, database-driven web application platforms empower non-programmers to rapidly create applications. Users interac-tions are translated to structured queries and executed. However, as a user is unlikely to know the underlying semantic connections among the fields presented in a form, it is often useful to provide her with some feedback about the queries built without exposing her to the underlying query language, in order to assist her in forming queries correctly. Explaining queries may be also useful for users who explicitly use a structured query language for verification or debugging purposes. In this paper, we take a graph-based approach to the query translation problem. We represent various forms of structured queries as directed graphs and we annotate the graph edges with <b>template</b> <b>labels</b> using an extensible template mechanism.

40|$|Relaxation {{labeling}} algorithms {{introduced by}} Rosenfeld et al., {{have been widely}} used in image and sequence matching applications. The underlying mechanism of labeling via relaxation is a deterministic dynamical system whose initial status converges to one of the attractors.

Modeling of images always precede the relaxation stage, however, apparently similar images can be judged as being quite distant, according {{to the nature of the}} modeling process.

In this study, the characteristics of NV 3 Dpol activity and initiation of RNA synthesis have been examined in vitro. Recombinant NV 3 Dpol, as well as a 3 Dpol active-site mutant were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. NV 3 Dpol was able to synthesize RNA in vitro and displayed flexibility with respect to the use of Mg 2 + or Mn 2 + as a cofactor. NV 3 Dpol yielded two different products when incubated with synthetic RNA in vitro: (i) a double-stranded RNA consisting of two single strands of opposite polarity or (ii) the single-stranded RNA <b>template</b> <b>labelled</b> at its 39 terminus by terminal transferase activity. Initiation of RNA synthesis occurred de novo rather than by back-priming, as evidenced {{by the fact that the}} two strands of the double-stranded RNA product could be separated, and by dissociation in time-course analysis of terminal transferase and RNA synthesis activities. In addition, RNA synthesis was not affected by blocking of the 39 terminus of the RNA template by a chain terminator, sustaining de novo initiation of RNA synthesis.

40|$|Abstract — Conditional random fields (CRF) and {{structural}} support vector machines (structural SVM) are two state-of-theart methods for structured prediction that captures the interdependencies among output variables. The {{success of these}} methods is attributed {{to the fact that}} their discriminative models are able to account for overlapping features on all input observations. These features are usually generated by applying a given set of <b>templates</b> on <b>labeled</b> data, but improper templates may lead to degraded performance. To alleviate this issue, in this paper we propose a novel multiple template learning paradigm to learn structured prediction and the importance of each template simultaneously, so that hundreds of arbitrary templates could be added into the learning model without caution. This paradigm can be formulated as a special multiple kernel learning problem with an exponential number of constraints. Then we introduce an efficient cutting-plane algorithm to solve this problem in the primal and present its convergence. We also evaluate the proposed learning paradigm on two widely studied structured prediction tasks, i. e., sequence labeling and dependency parsing. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms CRFs {{and structural}} SVMs because of exploiting the importance of each template. Complexity analysis and empirical results also show that the proposed method is more efficient than Online multikernel learning on very sparse and high-dimensional data. We further extend this paradigm for structured prediction using generalized p-block norm regularization with p> 1, and experiments show competitive performances when p ∈[1, 2).

30|$|Considering {{the pros}} and cons of HMMs and {{template}} methods, i.e., HMM-based statistical models are effective in compactly representing speech spectral distributions of discrete states but are ineffective in representing the fine details of speech dynamics, while template matching captures well the speech temporal evolutions but demands much larger computational complexity and memory space, it appears plausible to integrate the two approaches so as to exploit their strengths and avoid their weaknesses. In the current work, we propose a novel approach of integrating exemplar-based template matching with statistical modeling. We construct triphone context-dependent phone templates to preserve the time dynamic information of phone units and use phonetic decision trees to generate templates of tied triphone units, which improves the reliability of triphone templates and covers unseen triphones by some triphone clusters. The load on memory storage is reduced by using Gaussian mixture model (GMM) indices to represent the speech frames of the templates. It is worth noting that Gaussian indices were previously used to represent speech frames in speech segmentation [22], speech separation [23], and keyword spotting [24 – 26]. To facilitate comparison of the <b>templates</b> <b>labeled</b> by GMM indices, we propose the local distances of log likelihood ratio (LLR) and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for DTW-based template matching. To further reduce the costs of memory space and computation, we propose template selection methods to generate template representatives based on the criteria of minimum distance (MDTS) and maximum likelihood (MLTS) and we also propose a template compression method to integrate information from training templates to obtain more informative template representatives. In the recognition stage, the GMMs and the templates are used together by DTW with the proposed local distances. The proposed methods have been applied to lattice rescoring on the tasks of TIMIT [27] phone recognition and telehealth [28] large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, and they have led to consistent error reductions over the HMM baselines.|$|R

Using these methodologies, fiber bundle MROI for each volunteer was automatically generated. We assessed three strategies for inferring the automatic MROI utilizing nonrigid alignment of reference images and projection of template MROI. We assessed the bundle delineation error associated with alignment utilizing T 1 -weighted MRI, fractional anisotropy images, and full tensor images. We confirmed the smallest delineation error was achieved using the full tensor images. We then assessed three projection strategies for automatic determination of MROI in each volunteer.

A 3. 8 kb linear DNA template {{consisting of a}} specific transcription promoter for T 7 RNA polymerase placed upstream of 18 tandem repeats of a 207 bp nucleosome positioning sequence derived from the 5 S rRNA gene of Lytechinus variegatus {{was used as a}} template for chromatin reconstitution. Regularly spaced arrays of nucleosome cores were assembled onto this DNA template from donor histone octamers by salt step dialysis. Histone H 1 was incorporated onto free DNA or reconstituted chromatin <b>templates</b> and double <b>label</b> transcription assays were performed. The experiments indicated that histone H 1 has a strong inhibitory effect on both transcription initiation and elongation. These effects are especially pronounced on chromatin templates, where both transcription initiation and elongation are virtually halted. The inhibition of transcription elongation appears to result from a dramatic increase in premature termination of transcripts. These experiments indicate that assembly of histone H 1 into chromatin can result in structures which are completely repressed with respect to transcription...|$|R
30|$|The {{experimental}} {{procedures used}} for the RNA extraction and DNA microarray analysis have been described previously (Nakamura et al. [2008]). The total RNA was quantified using a Bioanalyzer 2100 with an RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Polyadenylated RNA (mRNA) from total RNA was purified using Oligotex-dT 30 [*]<[*]Super[*]>[*](Takara, Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We performed complementary DNA synthesis and labeling and array hybridization by following the Affymetrix user’s manual with a one-cycle target labeling and control reagent kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with 0.4  μg of mRNA as the <b>template</b> material. <b>Labeled</b> cDNA was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Yeast 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix) for 16  h at 45 °C with constant rotation at 60  rpm. Washing and staining were performed using a hybridization, wash, and stain kit (Affymetrix) on a GeneChip FS- 450 fluidics station (Affymetrix). Fluorescence was detected using the Affymetrix 3000 GeneArray Scanner, and the image analysis of each GeneChip was performed using the GeneChip Operating System 1.4. 0 (GCOS) software from Affymetrix with the standard default settings. Probe level data based on the gene expression data from two independent experiments were imported into GeneSpring GX 11.0. 2 (Agilent Technologies). Following 75 th percentile shift normalization, low-intensity probes subject to high degrees of noise were removed by filtering the lowest 20 % of each sample and then by filtering with flags (present and marginal). For the identification of differentially expressed genes, the Filter on Confidence function was used with a t-test P-value cutoff of 0.05, and a fold change threshold of 1.0 for the gene list was generated using the Filter on Volcano Plot tool. All experiments were done in duplicate with independently grown cells.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} role {{of environmental}} factors, including nurses’ scrubs, {{in the spread}} of infection {{is an area of}} growing interest. Laundering {{plays an important role in}} decontaminating scrubs. Our goal was to qualitatively assess the presence of S. aureus and MRSA on nursing student scrub tops, before and after laundering in college dormitory facilities. Study participants included junior and senior nursing students from Simmons College, Boston MA, who interned in acute inpatient clinical units during the 2013 - 14 academic year. Each participant was provided with sterile culturette swabs, swabbing <b>templates,</b> coded <b>labels,</b> sample transport bags, and detailed written and video sampling instructions. Participants used the template to standardize the swabbing area (abdominal, above the pockets), and collected samples after wearing the scrub top to clinicals, and again after laundering. Swabs were collected on Simmons campus, refrigerated and delivered weekly to UMass Lowell. Samples were cultured within 24 hr to mannitol salt agar, tryptic soy agar and Staphylococcus enrichment broth to ensure recovery of low numbers. Plates were incubated for up to 48 hr before determination of no growth. Positive enrichment broths with corresponding no growth plates were plated. Colonies morphologically consistent with S. aureus were identified with Gram stain, catalase and a commercial kit. Oxacillin and chromogenic MRSA plates were used to confirm methicillin susceptibility. Forty-three scrub tops were sampled pre and post laundering. Of the pre laundering samples, 11 (26 %) were contaminated with S. aureus, 5 (45 %) of which survived the laundering process. There were two instances of S. aureus on the post sample but not the pre. These pilot study findings demonstrate that student nursing scrub tops may act as a vector for infectious microorganisms, and that traditional laundering practices may not remove all pathogens. Additional samples will be obtained, and laundry conditions analyzed for possible correlation to survival post laundry...|$|R
40|$|Segmentation is {{the process}} of {{partitioning}} an image into subdivisions and can be applied to medical images to isolate anatomical or pathological areas for further analysis. This process can be done manually or automated by the use of image processing computer packages. Atlas-based segmentation automates this process by the use of a pre-labelled template and a registration algorithm. We developed an ovine brain atlas that {{can be used as a}} model for neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease and focal epilepsy. 17 female Corriedale ovine brains were imaged in-vivo in a 1. 5 T (low-resolution) MRI scanner. 13 of the low-resolution images were combined using a template construction algorithm to form a low-resolution template. The <b>template</b> was <b>labelled</b> to form an atlas and tested by comparing manual with atlas-based segmentations against the remaining four low-resolution images. The comparisons were in the form of similarity metrics used in previous segmentation research. Dice Similarity Coefficients were utilised to determine the degree of overlap between eight independent, manual and atlas-based segmentations, with values ranging from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (complete overlap). For 7 of these 8 segmented areas, we achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0. 5 - 0. 8. The amygdala was difficult to segment due to its variable location and similar intensity to surrounding tissues resulting in Dice Coefficients of 0. 0 - 0. 2. We developed a low resolution ovine brain atlas with eight clinically relevant areas labelled. This brain atlas performed comparably to prior human atlases described in the literature and to intra-observer error providing an atlas that can be used to guide further research using ovine brains as a model and is hosted online for public access.
