5|$|Trucking {{achieved}} {{national attention}} during the 1960s and 70s, when songs and movies about truck driving were major hits. Truck drivers participated in widespread strikes against <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> fuel, during the energy crises of 1973 and 1979.

5|$|In 1873 the Pekin duck was {{introduced}} to the United Kingdom. Although its meat was thought to have a poorer flavour than that of the Aylesbury duck, the Pekin was hardier and cheaper to raise. Many breeders switched to the Pekin duck or to Aylesbury-Pekin crosses. By the beginning of the 20th century competition from the Pekin duck, inbreeding, and disease in the pure-bred Aylesbury strain and <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> duck food meant the Aylesbury duck industry was in decline.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{computer}} users and manufacturers were becoming concerned about <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> programming. A 1959 survey {{had found that}} in any data processing installation, the programming cost US$800,000 on average and that translating programs to run on new hardware would cost $600,000. At a time when new programming languages were proliferating at an ever-increasing rate, the same survey suggested that if a common business-oriented language were used, conversion would be far cheaper and faster.|$|E
5|$|Returning to New York City, Willis reorganized, {{along with}} George Pope Morris, the weekly New York Mirror as the daily Evening Mirror in 1844 with a weekly {{supplement}} called the Weekly Mirror, {{in part due}} to <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> postage. By this time, Willis was a popular writer (a joke was that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was Germany's version of N. P. Willis) {{and one of the first}} commercially successful magazine writers in America. In the fall of that year, he also became the first editor of the annual gift book The Opal founded by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. During this time, he became the highest-paid magazine writer in America, earning about $100 per article and $5,000 per year, a number which would soon double. Even the popular poet Longfellow admitted his jealousy of Willis's salary.|$|E

25|$|In {{an effort}} to move to an all-jet fleet, the last Fokker 50 {{aircraft}} was withdrawn from service in April 2005. <b>The</b> <b>rising</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> oil made operating regional jets increasingly difficult. To lessen its exposure, Luxair decided to reintroduce turboprop aircraft, and in June 2006 it signed a firm order with Bombardier Aerospace for three Dash 8-Q400s, plus three options.
