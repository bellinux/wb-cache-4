25|$|The {{existence}} of the Lord's Taverners and the involvement of early members can be broadly summarised by the following:"We've all got professional and sporting interests in common. So why not start a club, based at the beloved old tavern here. We can <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> work and watch the cricket. And {{we can try to}} put a few bob back into the game at the same time."Since its inception, the Lord's Taverners has developed into a membership charity. For the first fifteen years, the NPFA was the sole beneficiary of the Lord's Taverners, with the money all going to cricket projects, mostly for the installation of artificial pitches.|$|E
500|$|Her {{opponent}} Scott Brown {{speculated that}} she had fabricated a native ancestry to gain an advantage in the employment market; the Brown campaign used Warren's lineage in several attack ads. In response, Warren's brothers issued a joint statement stating that they [...] "grew up listening to our mother and grandmother and other relatives <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> family's Cherokee and Delaware heritage". Brian Leiter of the Chicago Law School dismissed the allegations against Warren, noting that law schools have [...] "no pressure to hire Native Americans for affirmative action reasons", and that Warren's record of scholarship was [...] "clearly sufficient to get her appointed at Harvard". Several Brown staffers mocked Warren by doing the [...] "tomahawk chop" [...] at a Brown campaign rally, which Brown {{said he did not}} condone.|$|E
500|$|Overmars was {{selected}} in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team's 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. As the tournament progressed, Overmars felt the Netherlands were [...] "getting better and better" [...] and believed they could win the World Cup: [...] "Believe me, we can do it. In the past, {{there has been so}} much <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> side and a lot of pressure with people calling us favourites. This time, nobody seemed to expect anything. In fact, people would come up to me in the street and say we were only dark horses to win." [...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.|$|E

500|$|In April 2012, the Boston Herald {{sparked a}} {{campaign}} controversy when it reported that from 1986 to 1995 Warren had listed {{herself as a}} minority in the Association of American Law Schools (AALS) directories, called the AALS Directory of Law Teachers. Harvard Law School had publicized her minority status in response to criticisms about a lack of faculty diversity, but Warren {{said that she was}} unaware of this until she read about it in a newspaper during the 2012 election. Scott Brown, her Republican opponent in the Senate race, speculated that she had fabricated Native American heritage to gain advantage in the job market. Former colleagues and supervisors at universities where she had worked stated that Warren's ancestry played no role in her hiring. [...] Warren responded to the allegations, saying that she had self-identified as a minority in the directories in order to meet others with similar tribal roots. Her brothers defended her, stating that they [...] "grew up listening to our mother and grandmother and other relatives <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> family's Cherokee and Delaware heritage". In her 2014 autobiography, Warren described the allegations as untrue and hurtful. The New England Historic Genealogical Society found a family newsletter that alluded to a marriage license application that listed Elizabeth Warren’s great-great-great grandmother as part Cherokee, but could not find the primary document and found no proof of her descent. The Oklahoma Historical Society said that finding a definitive answer about Native American heritage can be difficult because of intermarriage and deliberate avoidance of registration.|$|E
2500|$|Oates founded The Ontario Review, a {{literary}} magazine, in 1974, with Raymond J. Smith, {{her husband and}} fellow graduate student, who would eventually become a professor of 18th-century literature. Smith would serve as editor of this venture, and Oates served as associate editor. The magazine's mission, according to Smith, the editor, was to bridge the literary and artistic culture of the U.S. and Canada: [...] "We tried to do this by publishing writers and artists from both countries, as well as essays and reviews of an intercultural nature." [...] In 1980, Oates and Smith founded Ontario Review Books, an independent publishing house. In 2004, Oates described the partnership as [...] "a marriage of like minds—both my husband and I are so interested in literature and we read the same books; he'll be reading a book and then I'll read it—we trade and we <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> reading at meal times…".|$|E
2500|$|Gandhi {{insisted that}} the {{conviction}} did not undermine her position, despite having been unseated from the lower house of parliament, Lok Sabha, by order of the High Court. She said: [...] "There {{is a lot of}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> government not being clean, but from our experience the situation was very much worse when [...] parties were forming governments". And she dismissed criticism of the way her Congress Party raised election campaign money, saying all parties used the same methods. The prime minister retained the support of her party, which issued a statement backing her. After news of the verdict spread, hundreds of supporters demonstrated outside her house, pledging their loyalty. Indian High Commissioner BK Nehru said Gandhi's conviction would not harm her political career. [...] "Mrs Gandhi has still today overwhelming support in the country," [...] he said. [...] "I believe the prime minister of India will continue in office until the electorate of India decides otherwise".|$|E

2500|$|On May 22, 2009, a video went viral of Hamilton freestyling, {{and then}} getting {{assaulted}} by his former girlfriend/fellow rapper Briana Latrise, the stepdaughter of Mary J. Blige, due to Hamilton rapping, [...] "OK, call me irresponsible and immature, but you're beautiful, {{what the hell}} else would I hit it for? Now I can say that I hit it raw, but {{that would mean that}} you will have to get an abor, or I just not need to go there", clarifying at some point at that past time that Hamilton had got Latrise pregnant but for undisclosed reasons Latrise would have an abortion. On May 25, 2009, during an interview, they both publicly apologized to each other, with Hamilton stating, [...] "I apologize honestly for putting some things out there that shouldn't have been out there. I understand it; it was the heat of the moment, and I didn't get the chance to really talk to you about it. I {{just wanted to tell you}} I apologize because I know what I shouldn't have said", and with Latrise remarking, [...] "I'm going to thank you for your apology. I'm going to apologize for acting outside of the norm. We're going to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> personal business, on our personal time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in December, {{there was}} {{controversy}} regarding Obama's admissions {{of drug use}} as a teen. Obama first publicly acknowledged the issue in his 1995 book, Dreams from My Father. In the book, Obama said [...] "Pot had helped, and booze. Maybe a little blow when you could afford it." [...] The issue was revived {{on the campaign trail}} after a November 2007 speech at a New Hampshire high school. Obama told the students, [...] "I've made some bad decisions that I've actually written about," [...] noting that his [...] "drinking and experimenting with drugs" [...] accounted for a lot of [...] "wasted time" [...] in high school. Some, including Republican candidate Mitt Romney, criticized Obama for discussing these examples with students. Romney said that [...] "in order to leave the best possible example for our kids, we're probably wisest not to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> own indiscretions in great detail." [...] However, fellow GOP candidate Rudy Giuliani and Partnership for a Drug-Free America president Stephen J. Pasierb praised Obama's candor. [...] "I respect his honesty," [...] Giuliani said. Pasierb told CNN that [...] "really the truth works best" [...] when discussing drug use with kids. Bill Shaheen, the co-chairman of Clinton's campaign in New Hampshire, mentioned the drug use in a December 12 conference call with reporters. Shaheen said that if Obama were to win the nomination, Republicans would use Obama's admissions against him in a general election. He suggested that in such a scenario, Republicans would ask, [...] "'When was the last time? Did you ever give drugs to anyone? Did you sell them to anyone?'" [...] He added that such [...] "Republican dirty tricks" [...] would be difficult to overcome. The comments immediately caused controversy, and Shaheen resigned the next day. Clinton denounced the comments and personally apologized to Obama. Her spokesman said that she [...] "made it clear that this kind of negative personal statement has no part in this campaign." [...] Appearing on Hardball with Chris Matthews, Axelrod accused the Clinton campaign of giving a [...] "wink and a nod" [...] to negative tactics. He criticized Clinton's December 3 statement in which she signaled a more aggressive approach and called it the [...] "fun part" [...] of the campaign. Axelrod said that the signal should come [...] "from the top" [...] that the campaigns will not be waged [...] "in the gutter." ...|$|E
