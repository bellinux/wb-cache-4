They contact Pjölk, who happily commands them to begin the transmission, then he turns off his tele-o-visor and sits {{down in front of}} his typewriter to create the headline article for tomorrow's issue of his tabloid. He fabricates an entire story based on how he is distressed for being responsible for killing the nerd viewers, and where he makes a statement saying {{that there should be a}} law banning tele-o-vision forever. Not yet aware of the danger <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> themselves in, Alalia and Fratt start broadcasting and begin their quest through the lair, following Ayn of Raiká.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of the Enhanced Edition, Night Dive Studios {{announced}} their plans to develop a reimagining of System Shock for Microsoft Windows, Xbox One and PlayStation 4, featuring improved art assets and other improvements, and reworking the game to use the Unreal Engine 4 game engine. Originally announced as System Shock Remastered, Night Dive Studios has opted to simply name the new game System Shock as they consider the effort <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> into the title makes it more of a reboot of the franchise rather than a remastering of the original game. Veteran designer Chris Avellone and members of the [...] development team are helping Night Dive Studios with the game. This reimagining is expected to released in 2018.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "cerulean speech", where Miranda {{draws the}} {{connection}} between the designer fashion in Runways pages and Andy's cerulean sweater, criticizing Andy's snobbishness about fashion and explaining the trickle-down effect, had its origins in a scene cut from earlier drafts that Streep had asked to have restored. It slowly grew from a few lines where the editor disparaged her assistant's fashion sense to a speech about [...] "why she thought fashion was important ... She is so aware that she is affecting billions of people, and what they pick off the floor and what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> on their bodies in the morning." [...] Streep said in 2016 she was interested in [...] "the responsibility lying on the shoulders of a woman who was the head of a global brand ... That scene wasn't about the fun of fashion, it was about marketing and business." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sachs also {{described}} Naomi as a layered character whose nature would be explored as the series progressed. With regard to playing such roles, McCord stated, [...] "I tend {{to reach out}} to people like Clark because I can see <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> on a facade and are not as bad as they seem.

2500|$|In mid-November 2014, the TCQ {{launched}} an anti-Uber media campaign, {{in which it}} warns Uber passengers that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> their lives at risk.

[...] Uber responded with information about its insurance policy, including a $US5 million contingency liability insurance cover and [...] "each partner driver's own full insurance policies". The TCQ also {{launched an}} online parliamentary petition to ensure that Uber remains illegal in Queensland, while Emerson said that, since August, the government had issued [...] "more than $170,000 in fines to 62 [...] drivers".|$|E

2500|$|Giles and O'Keefe {{have been}} criticized for {{accuracy}} problems. Their videos include the oft-repeated conservative claim that ACORN is expected to get up to $8.5 billion in government funds. But that's a bold exaggeration, as it includes $3 billion in stimulus funds set aside for revitalization efforts nationwide, and $5.5 billion in federal community development grants.The more than $8 billion number was based on the false assumption that ACORN would apply for and win every project and grant in the country, and in fact ACORN did not apply for any of the stimulus funds. Leonnig also observed:the videos, in some cases, left out what I would call some exculpatory material ... for example, in one, a San Bernadino employee at ACORN explains {{that there is no way}} ACORN would support what the couple were proposing, and she asks if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>putting</b> her on, candid-camera style.During a September 14 television appearance on FOX, O'Keefe appeared dressed in a fur coat, sunglasses, and holding a cane. The host announced: [...] " [...] is dressed exactly in the same outfit that he wore to these ACORN offices up and down the eastern seaboard." [...] He asked, [...] "s that what you think a pimp looks like?" [...] O'Keefe answered yes. Within weeks, political journalist Mike Stark revealed that O'Keefe did not wear such clothing to the ACORN offices, but rather he wore subdued clothing and a tie, and in one instance posed as a candidate for Congress. Stark said, [...] "If they really wanted the truth out there, why do they need to edit these tapes in the first place? Why aren't the unedited videos already in the public domain?" ...|$|E
