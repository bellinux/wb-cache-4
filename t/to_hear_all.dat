5|$|The Saudi {{system of}} justice {{has been criticized for}} being slow, arcane, lacking in some of the {{safeguards}} of justice and unable to deal with the modern world. In 2007, King Abdullah issued royal decrees with the aim of reforming the judiciary and creating a new court system. The reforms have yet to be implemented in full but, once they are, will include the creation of a Supreme Court and the transfer of the Board of Grievances' commercial and criminal jurisdictions to a restructured general court system. New specialist first instance courts will be established comprising general, criminal, personal status, commercial and labor courts. The Sharia courts will therefore lose their general jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> cases and the work load of the government's administrative tribunals will be transferred to the new courts. Another important change is the establishment of appeal courts for each province. It has been claimed that the reforms will establish a system for codifying Sharia and incorporating the principle of judicial precedent into court practice.|$|E
25|$|The County Court is {{authorized}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> criminal {{cases that have}} occurred in the county as well as limited jurisdiction over civil cases. The County Court handles felony cases exclusively and shares jurisdiction with the town and village justice courts on misdemeanor cases and other minor offenses and violations. The County Court's jurisdiction on civil cases is limited to those involving less than $25,000.|$|E
25|$|The People's Party-led Spanish {{government}} under Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy {{announced that it}} would appeal the bill to the Constitutional Court, which agreed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> four of its unconstitutionality appeals and subsequently suspended the law and the referendum until it could rule upon the matter. Despite the referendum suspension, the Catalan government announced it would proceed with the vote anyway. This prompted Attorney General José Manuel Maza to ask security forces to investigate possible preparations from the Catalan government to hold the vote, as well as announcing he would present criminal charges against members of both the regional parliament and government for voting and signing off the referendum. The national government proceeded to deploy a series of legal measures intended to nullify the referendum, while also warning local councils in Catalonia to either impede or paralyse efforts to carry out the vote. Previously, local mayors had been given 48 hours by the regional government to confirm the availability of polling stations for 1 October. On 7 September and under a similar procedure as the day previously, pro-independence lawmakers in the Parliament of Catalonia passed the legal framework that was to prevail the Spanish one should a majority vote for the 'Yes' to independence choice.|$|E

500|$|Hesketh was {{influenced}} {{in the early}} planning stages by his friends, including mill owners Samuel Fielden and Benjamin Whitworth. They pointed out that mill workers would not wish to make day trips to the seaside all year round, and wondered how {{the people of the}} new town would be occupied during the winter months. They encouraged Hesketh to build a new port; because charges at Liverpool were on the rise, and there were no reasonable alternatives for Manchester mill owners, both Whitworth and Fielden agreed that they would make good use of a port on the Fylde coast. Hesketh soon found that he {{was not the only one}} thinking of extending the railway, or of building a new port. He had competition from the residents of Lytham, a village about [...] south of Rossall, at the mouth of the River Ribble. They were already planning the formation of the Preston Port Company; Hesketh acted quickly and applied to the official railway committee to have a port built on the River Wyre. The committee agreed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> applications.|$|E
500|$|Echevarria {{suggested}} this to Behr over lunch, but {{he initially}} was not sure. By {{the time they}} had returned separately to the studio, Behr had an entire plan worked out based on the new premise for the character. Behr suggested that the character should be basically acting as if she's schizophrenic, saying [...] "We'd never played up the idea in the past, but it made sense. What must it be like <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> those voices and opinions?" [...] The producers also decided that they wanted a younger actress who felt vulnerable in order to offset the strength that Jadzia had grown into over the years. Casting remained difficult, until Hans Beimler suggested an actress from Canada whom he had once worked with – Nicole de Boer. She had worked with Beimler on the television series Beyond Reality and TekWar. She was asked to submit an audition tape where she played out a scene between Ezri and Quark, which she recorded herself in the hotel room she was staying at, and later admitted that she did not know what a Trill was at the time.|$|E
500|$|At Electric Lady, Badu {{applied a}} {{multifaceted}} approach to recording her vocals and opted against editing them in post-production. Using her voice impressionistically, her vocals {{were characterized by}} high scales, varied frequencies, wide intervals, and time-stretched harmonies. Chavarria, who engineered the vocals with Badu, remarked on her singing, [...] "Her voice has so many frequencies, from a subharmonic of her tonic to a thin raspiness, and she wants <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> of that." [...] Badu used a Shure SM57 dynamic microphone, finding it to have enough bottom for her voice type, and cut vocal takes while situated between two speakers in the studio's control room with the monitor mix playing. She explained this setting to be more comfortable, noting the ability to hear herself sing and hold the microphone when moving around. Badu preferred to sing in one take rather than edit different takes together: [...] "When I do vocals, I am singing with a certain volume in my voice. I am singing the double and triple harmonies at different volumes. You don't have to adjust it; I have already done it. We mix as we go, {{so by the time}} we put the vocals to ½-inch tape, I know it. If you touch a damn thing, I will know it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2004, West had {{his first}} {{of a number of}} public {{incidents}} during his attendance at music award events. At the American Music Awards of 2004, West stormed out of the auditorium after losing Best New Artist to country singer Gretchen Wilson. He later commented, [...] "I felt like I was definitely robbed [...] I was the best new artist this year." [...] After the 2006 Grammy nominations were released, West said he would [...] "really have a problem" [...] if he did not win the Album of the Year, saying, [...] "I don't care what I do, I don't care how much I stunt – you can never take away from the amount of work I put into it. I don't want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> of that politically correct stuff." [...] On November 2, 2006, when his [...] "Touch the Sky" [...] failed to win Best Video at the MTV Europe Music Awards, West went onto the stage as the award was being presented to Justice and Simian for [...] "We Are Your Friends" [...] and argued that he should have won the award instead. Hundreds of news outlets worldwide criticized the outburst. On November 7, 2006, West apologized for this outburst publicly during his performance as support act for U2 for their Vertigo concert in Brisbane. He later spoofed the incident on the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live in September 2007.|$|E
500|$|Unorthodox Jukebox was {{met with}} {{generally}} favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 70, based on 16 reviews. Melissa Maerz from Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A– and stated that [...] " [...] talent for crafting little pop perfections of all stripes is undeniable", describing the record as a fusion of pop and R Rolling Stone magazine's Jody Rosen awarded Unorthodox Jukebox {{four out of five}} stars, writing that, [...] "The result is a record that makes the competition sound sad and idea-starved by comparison". Dan Hyman from Spin granted the record an 8/10 rating, pointing out that [...] "the bulk of Unorthodox Jukebox benefits from presenting [...] as he truly imagines himself: a big belter with an ear for pop hooks, sure, but one unafraid to dive into murkier waters." [...] Hyman went on feeling that Mars' lyrics [...] "get a desperately needed kick in the pants". Matt Cibula of PopMatters complimented the songs' hooks and found the album [...] "sung and arranged just as perfectly as his earlier work [...] a truly accomplished and slick pop album". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times labelled the songwriting exceptional, while praising Mars for being [...] "a model of concision who always knows where the trigger is, and always, always pulls it". He went on complimenting the songs on the record, [...] "these {{are some of the most}} energy-infused but profoundly cosseted songs you’re likely <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> year".|$|E
500|$|When [...] "Better than Today" [...] {{became a}} single, reviews {{for the song}} itself were mixed. McAlpine of BBC said [...] "the {{relentless}} swaggering momentum" [...] of the track [...] "gets a little wearing". He continued, [...] "At some point, something ELSE needs to happen, y'see [...] No {{matter how many times}} Kylie's voice swoops up high and skips back down again, no matter how firmly she pushes herself into those demanding choruses; it begins like Tigger and ends like a route march around an aerobics class." [...] He gave the single three out of five stars. Popjustice, while stating the song is [...] "rather enjoyable", added that it is a [...] "no-harm-intended album track" [...] instead of [...] "the big balls-out I'm-bloody-Kylie comeback single". They remarked at a later date, saying that they were [...] "slightly alarmed" [...] when the song became a single. Nima Baniamer of Contact Music described the song as [...] "a fun electro number", but it [...] "sadly doesn't seem to pack a punch enough to stand firm as a lead-out track". Originally in an album review, Levine of Digital Spy called the tune [...] "as uplifting a dance-pop ditty as we're likely <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> year". In a single review, Levine re-evaluated the song, stating that it is not [...] "the freshest confection you'll sample this party season" [...] but he continued, calling it [...] "sweet, seductive and pretty much impossible not to succumb to over and over again". He gave the single four out of five stars.|$|E

2500|$|His {{address was}} {{scheduled}} for October 6, 1917. His opponents in Congress manipulated the schedule so they would follow him and prevent rebuttal. The public, sensing drama, packed the viewing galleries, {{and the majority of}} Senators made sure they were present <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> the speeches. Upon taking the floor, La Follette read in an unemotional detached manner a speech he had prepared defending free speech in wartime. Upon his conclusion there was a spontaneous outburst of applause that had to be gavelled into order. This speech is hailed as [...] "a classic argument for free speech during time of war".|$|E
2500|$|Supporters also {{praise the}} {{increase}} in discourse and available surrounding information about ballot initiatives resulting from the Bellotti decision. Lawyer Francis H. Fox wrote, [...] " [...] perceives that the First Amendment's purposes are better served by allowing the [...] use of means of communication than by enacting legislation designed to foster equality of access to those means." [...] Prentice {{also noted that the}} Court acted correctly by protecting the rights of listeners <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> possible pertinent information. This is the [...] "right to receive" [...] doctrine, which interprets the First Amendment as protecting individuals' right to receive information as part of freedom of communication.|$|E

2500|$|The Rite for Reconciliation of Several Penitents with General Confession and Absolution — {{is similar}} to the second, except that the penitents do not make an actual confession, but only {{manifest}} contrition (general confession). The prayer of absolution is given collectively or [...] "generally" [...] to all those gathered to celebrate the sacrament (general absolution). The penitents are obliged to actually confess each grave sin in their next confession. This form is intended for emergencies and other situations when {{it is not at all}} possible for the priest(s) <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> the individual confessions. This rite has been discouraged for widespread use by the Vatican in many countries recently.|$|E
2500|$|The {{creation}} of Eve, according to Rabbi Joshua, is that: [...] "God deliberated from what member He would create woman, and He reasoned with Himself thus: I must not create her from Adam's head, for {{she would be}} a proud person, and hold her head high. If I create her from the eye, then she will wish to pry into all things; if from the ear, she will wish <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> things; if from the mouth, she will talk much; if from the heart, she will envy people; if from the hand, she will desire to take all things; if from the feet, she will be a gadabout. Therefore I will create her from the member which is hid, that is the rib, which is not even seen when man is naked." ...|$|E

This film adds [...] "rich contextual layers to the case, including a dive into the history of Los Angeles race relations that played such a central role in his acquittal". As James Poniewozik observed in his June 20, 2016, New York Times review: [...] "the director Ezra Edelman pulls back, way back, like a news chopper over a freeway chase. Before you hear about the trial, the documentary says, you need <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> the stories—the stories of race, celebrity, sports, America—that it's a part of."

2500|$|Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly and Theon Weber of Stylus Magazine {{gave the}} album a [...] "B" [...] rating, while Willman praised Lavigne for [...] "providing the best darn rock & roll album teen girls are likely <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> year", Weber {{described}} the album as an [...] "enormous, senseless, superficial, selfish, and cocky {{past the point}} of absurdity, but it’s never wrong." [...] Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone praised the album for being [...] "totally fearless about targeting pop radio and rather expert in its execution." [...] Tim O'Neil of PopMatters was positive towards its uptempo songs, calling it [...] "strong pop-punk turns," [...] while considering the ballads [...] "regrettable". However, O'Neil praised Lavigne for making [...] "the brave decision to measure artistic maturity with no one’s yardstick but her own." [...] In a more mixed review, Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that [...] "as an album, 'The Best Damn Thing' is too relentless to be heard end to end", while Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine was more critical with the album's unexpected move, calling it [...] "a big step back for an artist who was just starting to grow up." ...|$|E

Right now, R is not a genre anymore. It's pop, it's hip-hop, it's other things. I wanna bring back rhythm and blues." [...] During a different interview, the girls talked about how different this album was from their shelved debut: [...] "Well it's very different coming out now because with this album we have more creative control. When we came out in 2003, we were young and we didn't {{have much of a}} say in what went down. But this time around, we were able to write every song on the album, which makes this album very personal for all of us." [...] They later added on, [...] "From this album you can expect realness. Expect <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>all</b> of our individual voices. A lot of crunk tracks like our first single 'Do It to It'. Also expect a lot of a cappella singing." ...|$|E
