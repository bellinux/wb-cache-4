Titled Quatermass 2, the film was released in 1957 and once again directed by Val Guest, with Brian Donlevy starring; unlike the first film, Kneale wrote the screenplay himself. In the United States, the film was released under the title Enemy from Space.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1808, the Portuguese {{were the}} only European people to settle Brazil in {{significant}} numbers. Although British, Germans, Italians and Spanish had previously immigrated to Brazil, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> done so as {{a small number of}} individuals or in very small groups. These earliest non-Portuguese settlers did not {{have a significant impact on}} the culture of Portugal's Brazilian colony. The situation changed after 1808 when King JoãoVI began to encourage immigration from European countries outside Portugal.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Okinawa in July, Guam {{was assigned to}} Cruiser Task Force 95, where she served as the flagship, along with her sister Alaska, {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Francis S. Low. On 16 July, Guam and Alaska conducted a sweep into the East China and Yellow Seas to sink Japanese shipping. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> limited success, however, and returned to the fleet on 23 July. They then joined a major raid, which included three battleships and three escort carriers, into the estuary of the Yangtze River off Shanghai. Again, the operation met with limited success, and they returned to Okinawa by 7 August.|$|E
5|$|After the {{kick-off}} {{there was}} soon a scrum ordered The All Blacks were repeatedly penalised by the referee whenever {{they had a}} scrum. The reason for this was the All Blacks 2–3–2 scrum formation where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> two front-rowers. The Welsh team used a three-man front row, and had studied the All Blacks scrummaging technique. The Welsh countered the All Blacks 2–3–2 scrum formation by setting their front row after the All Blacks, and hence preventing the All Blacks from gaining the loosehead. Consequently, every time the All Blacks tried to hook the ball they were penalised, and this prompted their captain Gallaher to order his team not to contest the scrums, and to instead let the Welsh win the ball.|$|E

5|$|As late {{as in the}} Tudor and Stuart {{periods in}} Britain, herbals often still {{classified}} plants {{in the same way}} as Dioscorides and other classical authors, not by their structure or apparent relatedness but by how they smelt and tasted, whether they were edible, and what medicinal uses <b>they</b> <b>had.</b> <b>Only</b> when European botanists like Matthias de l'Obel, Andrea Cesalpino and Augustus Quirinus Rivinus (Bachmann) had done their best to match plants they knew to those listed in Dioscorides did they go further and create new classification systems based on similarity of parts, whether leaves, fruits, or flowers.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} repatriations, {{returned}} prisoners were generally treated with pity, suspicion and disdain by French civilians. Many believed that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> {{been allowed to}} return in exchange for agreeing to collaborate. Later Vichy propaganda had implied that prisoners lived in good conditions, so many civilians believed that the prisoners had suffered much less than civilians during the conflict. As veterans of the 1940 Battle of France, the prisoners were blamed for the French defeat and portrayed as cowards who had surrendered, rather than fight to the death. They were also unfavourably compared with other men of their generation who {{had served in the}} Free French Forces or Resistance.|$|E
5|$|Maitland's 1st Foot Guards, who had {{defeated}} the Chasseurs of the Guard, {{were thought to}} have {{defeated the}} Grenadiers, although <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> faced Chasseurs of the newly raised Middle Guard. They were nevertheless awarded the title of Grenadier Guards in recognition of their feat and adopted bearskins {{in the style of}} the Grenadiers. Britain's Household Cavalry likewise adopted the cuirass in 1821 in recognition of their success against their armoured French counterparts. The effectiveness of the lance was noted by all participants and this weapon subsequently became more widespread throughout Europe; the British converted their first light cavalry regiment to lancers in 1816, their uniforms, of Polish origin, were based on those of the Imperial Guard lancers.|$|E

The tour to support Paper Scissors Stone was cancelled, and a month later, the band announced that they were breaking up. Matthews has subsequently released solo albums, while Powell has become a radio presenter and joined the supergroup The Stand to release a charity single. Critics have highlighted the use of metaphors in Catatonia's work, and songs have been compared to poetry by critics. Writing duties had been shared across the band, although had been led by Matthews and Roberts. They disagreed with being labelled an indie band, with Powell saying <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> ever sought to write pop music.|$|E
5|$|Overclaiming of aerial {{victories}} was not uncommon, {{and both}} sides claimed more aircraft shot down than was the case. For the 18 August action, British propaganda claimed 144 German aircraft destroyed, which was over twice the actual figure. In response, the Germans claimed <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> lost 36, a figure which has since been proven to be half the actual figure (69 to 71). The German propaganda elements claimed to have destroyed 147 British aircraft, which was over twice the actual figure. Again, the British admitted to losing only 23, when the actual figure was around 68. Other sources between them insist the RAF's losses were 27–34 fighters destroyed, and 29 aircraft destroyed on the ground, including only eight fighters.|$|E
5|$|Some {{survivors}} of Hurricane Liza complained that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> received one ration {{of food and}} water within 3 days of the passage of Liza. Subsequently, armed troops guarded gangs of looters that damaged additional homes. An effort was made to cure people who were suffering from sickness, but by midday on October3, after treating more than 5,000persons, the effort had been halted {{due to a lack of}} sterile cotton vital for administrating the shots. Medical workers attempted to vaccinate all survivors for typhoid fever and tetanus, but the supply of syringes ran short. A large memorial service was held on October2 in a nearby church.|$|E

In the article, Fichtelius asked Johansson why they had not made the game commercially available for home computers; Johansson said that it had been considered but that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> developed the game because it was a fun challenge for them, and {{that they would have to}} find a distributor of computer programs if they wanted to create a PC version.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} now under a rector, who {{replaced}} the lay abbot; and any remaining priests of the clas and their abod were presumably expelled. If one accepts {{the evidence of}} the inquisition taken before Rhys ap Gruffydd, lieutenant of the Justiciar, at Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn, 1 September 1326 (which conflicts with Gerald's account), as early as 1212 there were apparently only two monks (from St Peter's, Gloucester) in residence. However, {{it is difficult to see}} how they can have remained, in light of Welsh control of the area; possibly <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> arrived in 1211; we don't know whether there was a priest resident (one of the monks might have been a priest).|$|E
5|$|After their {{experience}} of the perils and obstacles of government, the political figures who had arisen during the 1830s saw the Emperor as providing a fundamental source of authority essential for governing and for national survival. These elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until, by the 1880s, they had almost entirely {{been replaced by a}} newer generation of politicians who had no experience of the early years of PedroII's reign. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> known a stable administration and prosperity and saw no reason to uphold and defend the imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. To them PedroII was merely an old and increasingly sick man who had steadily eroded his position by taking an active role in politics for decades. Before he had been above criticism, but now his every action and inaction prompted meticulous scrutiny and open criticism. Many young politicians had become apathetic toward the monarchic regime and, when the time came, they would do nothing to defend it. PedroII's achievements went unremembered and unconsidered by the ruling elites. By his very success, the Emperor had made his position seem unnecessary.|$|E
