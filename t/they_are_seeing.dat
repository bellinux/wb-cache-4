5|$|A {{feature-length film}} that {{indirectly}} parodies Star Trek is Galaxy Quest. This film {{is based on}} the premise that aliens monitoring the broadcast of an Earth-based TV series called Galaxy Quest, modeled heavily on Star Trek, believe that what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> is real. Many Star Trek actors have been quoted saying that Galaxy Quest was a brilliant parody.|$|E
5|$|Sun is at a party, and {{is served}} {{champagne}} by a waiter, Jin. They soon develop a relationship, with Sun wanting {{to run away}} with Jin to America, but Jin insisting they honorably tell her father that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> each other. Sun's father approves of their relationship as long as Jin takes a job working for him. One night after they're married, Jin returns home covered in someone else's blood. Sun is angry that he refuses to explain the blood to her and slaps him. He tells Sun that he does whatever her father tells him to do. A few years later, Sun secretly plots to leave Jin and her father, so she will be free to go wherever she wants. However, she does not go through with her plans after he expresses a loving gesture to her, and boards Flight 815 with her husband.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{the play}} has a {{representational}} form. The audience {{is not involved}} with the story, but to interpret what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing.</b>|$|E

25|$|For his 2011 {{exhibition}} of drawings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Serra reworked {{some of his}} earlier pieces on paper which had been damaged or destroyed, recreating them specifically for the show. The museum labeled the works with two dates: that of the original {{and that of the}} reworked version. According to Serra, however, it is not important whether audiences know which version <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kappa legends {{are said}} {{to be based on the}} Japanese giant {{salamander}} or hanzaki, an aggressive salamander that grabs its prey with its powerful jaws. Other theories suggest they are based on historical sightings of the now extinct Japanese river otter as seen from a distance, otters have been known to stand upright and a drunk, frightened or hallucinating person may think <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> a humanoid entity and not a wild animal.|$|E
25|$|In May 2014, Mattel American Girl opened {{new stores}} in Toronto, Ontario and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in {{partnership}} with Indigo Books and Music. The company has also expressed interest in other overseas ventures, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> orders from Europe and Latin America. The company has also announced that they're expanding their operations in Mexico, with two stores at El Palacio de Hierro’s Perisur and Interlomas in Mexico City, and a third in Polanco in 2015.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the semidocumentary style faded. The {{standard}} documentary had {{blurred the}} difference between itself and fiction so much that there was viewer confusion regarding what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Salviati starts by repeating that Aristotle {{would be}} {{changing}} his opinions {{if he saw}} what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing.</b> [...] "It <b>is</b> the followers of Aristotle who have crowned him with authority, not he who has usurped or appropriated it to himself." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{paused and}} {{regarded}} his listeners. The bepuzzlement {{in their faces}} was delicious. Also, there was awe in their faces. Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing</b> it then, as they sat there, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> frightened by it.|$|R
25|$|Interpretive Guides {{with the}} 501(c)(3) {{non-profit}} American Passenger Rail Heritage Foundation ride the South Shore Line roundtrip on select Saturdays between Millennium Station and South Bend Airport station providing passengers with onboard educational programs. These APRHF Rail Rangers programs are also {{sponsored by the}} Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District and the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Guides tell passengers what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> out the window, including about the four units of the National Park Service the train line passes through or near.|$|E
25|$|Zoo Corps is a {{volunteer}} {{program at the}} San Diego Zoo that enlists {{high school students to}} teach guests at the zoo about the animals <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> and their place in the ecosystem. It enrolls students between 13 and 17 years of age. The goals are to promote public education about animals and conservation, and to help the students develop their ability to speak in public. The program runs year round in two sessions, one from May through November and one from January through May. Members of the Zoo Corps are expected to volunteer at least once a month.|$|E
25|$|The couple's {{divorce is}} {{finalized}} in 1987 and Angie damages Den by demanding a large divorce settlement. Den runs The Queen Vic alone, initially assisted by Jan, but this relationship ends when Jan grows disillusioned with Den's treatment of her. Den has a fling with the Vic's caterer, Magda Czajkowski (Kathryn Apanowicz), but is scorned when she eventually opts to date Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) instead. When he discovers that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> each other, he punches Simon, sacks him and throws {{him out of}} his home in the Vic. Whilst single again, Den begins to realise that The Vic's trade is floundering without Angie. With some meddling from Sharon, Den and Angie decide to reunite as business partners and she returns to live at The Vic. However, it is short-lived, because Angie falls in love with her friend, Sonny. Realising that Angie is planning to leave him, Den visits a solicitor and makes certain that Angie has no claim on The Queen Vic. Angie leaves Walford for Spain in May 1988 with nothing, and they never see or hear anything of each other again.|$|E
50|$|An early {{example of}} this was Gone with the Wind (1939). Running almost four hours in length, the film was divided into the above components, so that the film patron can {{experience}} the film as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing</b> an actual play in a theater.|$|R
50|$|A fourth {{challenge}} was sent: three green rifle-grenade flares. After firing, Steel counted slowly to 15 {{and then decided}} that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing</b> a German U-boat. He ordered tubes 7 and 8 fired with a three-second interval. Less than a minute later, an explosion was heard.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{successful}} Unification of Bulgaria, the rusophile {{circles in the}} country hold Knyaz Alexander Battenberg responsible for {{the deterioration of the}} relations with Russia, which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing</b> as a supporter for the restoration of Bulgaria in the boundaries, promised by the preliminary Treaty of San Stefano.|$|R
500|$|Another {{approach}} applies {{specifically to}} the study of self-awareness, that is, the ability to distinguish oneself from others. [...] In the 1970s Gordon Gallup developed an operational test for self-awareness, known as the mirror test. [...] The test examines whether animals are able to differentiate between seeing themselves in a mirror versus seeing other animals. The classic example involves placing a spot of coloring on the skin or fur near the individual's forehead and seeing if they attempt to remove it or at least touch the spot, thus indicating that they recognize that the individual <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> in the mirror is themselves. [...] Humans (older than 18 months) and other great apes, bottlenose dolphins, killer whales, pigeons, European magpies and elephants have all been observed to pass this test.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Evangelical {{journalist}} Richard Abanes, who {{has written}} several books arguing against new religions and Mormonism, published a polemical text that made similar allegations to the video: Harry Potter and the Bible: The Menace Behind the Magick. Later editions incorporated comparisons and contrasts between Harry Potter and the more overtly Christian works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. In an interview with CBN.com, Abanes remarked that, [...] "One of the easiest ways to know whether a fantasy book or film has real world magick in it is to just ask a simple question, 'Can my child find information in a library or bookstore that {{will enable them to}} replicate what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> in the film or the book?' If you go to The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings what you see in, story magic and imagination, it is not real. You can't replicate it. But if you go to something like Harry Potter, you can find references to astrology, clairvoyance, and numerology. It takes seconds to go into a bookstore or library and get books on that and start investigating it, researching it, and doing it." ...|$|E
500|$|Performer Neal Medlyn re-enacted the DVD {{during his}} {{performance}} at the New Museum in April 2008 together with dancers Will Rawls and Erick Montes. His performance was one-hour long and it was titled The Neal Medlyn Experience Live. He sang along to the DVD audio track, complete with word-for-word between-song patter and band introductions. Booth Newspapers' Roger LeLeivre reviewed the re-enactment positively writing, [...] "The event... was a hoot, and the audience loved every second of it. Medlyn has Beyoncé's signature, often spastic, moves down pat, down to each minute hand gesture and facial expression... Unlike a drag show, Medlyn does not try to convince anyone <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> Beyoncé. There wasn't {{much in the way}} of costumes (well, he did enter in a black wig, tube top and hot pants, but those bit the dust rather quickly), and why bother?". He concluded that the length of the show was [...] "perfect" [...] as it [...] "ended before the shtick wore out its welcome". LeLeivre finished his review by writing, [...] "It was a delicious pop-culture skewering, right down to the back-up dancers, with their over-the-top moves and expressions... Clearly it enhanced the 'experience,' if you had a passing acquaintance with Beyoncé's songs... but such knowledge was not a prerequisite to enjoying this homage". Claudia La Rocco of The New York Times described his re-enactment as [...] "absurdly faithful" [...] and added that it wouldn't have been nearly as [...] "smart or touching" [...] without the dancing of Rawls and Montes. She further put the performance in her list of the [...] "richest" [...] moments of 2008 and noted, [...] "These astounding performers slipped between genders and among genres, enveloping Mr. Medlyn in utter fabulousness and proving just how sophisticated pop culture can be. Backup dancers everywhere should feel proud." ...|$|E
5000|$|The lineup {{for each}} year's Horrorthon is a closely guarded secret. According to Gervasi: “I {{think if the}} people knew what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>they</b> would pick and choose and chart when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going to be there,” {{explained}} Gervasi. “It creates a sense of excitement where {{you have no idea}} what you’re going to see.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Powers made {{a speech}} {{about the death of}} British wrestling veteran and TV actor [...] "Bomber" [...] Pat Roach and the request to play the British {{national}} anthem before the main event got fans to think <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing</b> a different side to Powers, or so <b>they</b> <b>were</b> to believe as no one was expecting the following events.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{begins with}} the crew of a {{spaceship}} seeing explosions in space and asteroids flying by. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> afraid that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> going to be hit, but their ship's computer, named Wiz, tells them that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing</b> the [...] "refraction" [...] of an event that took place millions of years ago.

2500|$|As {{children}} {{move forward}} with their reading skills, they {{learn a great deal}} about what is really inside a word; the stem, roots, prefixes and suffixes that make up morphemes of the language. [...] By this stage, children already know about the common bound morphemes such as [...] "s" [...] and [...] "ed" [...] because these are attached to many words. [...] Decoding readers become exposed to many types of morphemes such as prefixes and suffixes, and it is when they learn to read these as [...] "sight chunks" [...] that their reading and their understanding will speed up dramatically. Being able to read at a fluent level is not only about how fast a child can read, but {{it is a matter of}} being able to utilize all the special knowledge that they have about a word—its letters, letter patterns, meanings, grammatical functions, roots, and endings—fast enough that they have time to think and comprehend what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing.</b> [...] The point of becoming a proficient reader is to fluently read and comprehend what had just been read. Decoding readers are just beginning to understand and learn how to use their expanding knowledge of language and their growing powers of inference to figure out what they are really reading.|$|E
2500|$|From 1977 to 1981, Jon [...] "Bowzer" [...] Bauman hosted {{other musicians}} on his {{television}} show Sha Na Na. He talked with Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Charlie Thomas of the Drifters, discovering {{in the process}} {{that they were being}} victimized by [...] "knock-off" [...] groups of performers using the name of a famous group without having a member of that group. Ben E. King said he, Thomas and Bill Pinkney were losing out on potential gigs and income because there were [...] "so many fake Drifters performing". Herb Reed of the Platters told Bauman that his group had experienced [...] "about 30" [...] court cases fighting against fake groups. Researching the laws, Bauman found that the original musicians had scant legal protection against their group name being used by promoters or other performers, so he determined to amend the existing laws to increase protection for the original musicians. He allied with the Vocal Group Hall of Fame (VGHF) to bring famous musicians together to help promote these new laws. VGHF President Bob Crosby said of the fake groups [...] "It's a form of identity theft to the artists... Most importantly it is misleading the public for them to think <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> the artist who made the hits when they are not." [...] Mary Wilson of the Supremes joined the effort, appearing with Bauman before the US Congress in March 1999. She said [...] "We want these fake groups to say they are tribute groups or get their own name." ...|$|E

50|$|Antiquarians, {{including}} John Leland and William Camden, conducted {{surveys of}} the English countryside, drawing, describing and interpreting the monuments that they encountered.

6000|$|I see {{not what}} one thing {{there is of}} so many as {{are to be found}} in the [...] whole world, wherein there is need of a greater courage than to treat [...] of {{committing}} treason against a king, and to know that he knows it [...] well, and yet never to go out of his presence. For howsoever it be [...] very true that we are always in the presence of God; yet methinks that [...] they who converse with him in prayer are in his presence after a more [...] particular manner; for <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> then that he sees them; whereas [...] others may, perhaps, remain some days in his presence, yet without [...] remembering that he looks upon them.|$|E
6000|$|Ador. [...] Calm-deep.

5000|$|The odd naming {{choice of}} the serial's main hero, [...] "Commando Cody," [...] was {{possibly}} an attempt by Republic to make young audiences think <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing</b> another adventure of Commander Corry, {{the hero of the}} popular ABC TV and radio series Space Patrol (1950-1955). There is, however, no surviving evidence that this was a consideration by anyone at Republic.|$|R
