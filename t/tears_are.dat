Indra, moved by Surabhi's tears, rains to stop the ploughing of the tormented bullock.|$|E
5|$|Lesions can be transverse, {{occurring}} {{between the}} rings of the trachea, longitudinal or spiral. They may occur along the membranous {{part of the}} trachea, the main bronchi, or both. In 8% of ruptures, lesions are complex, occurring {{in more than one}} location, with more than one type of lesion, or on both of the main bronchi and the trachea. Transverse <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> more common than longitudinal or complex ones. The laceration may completely transect the airway or it may go only partway around. Partial tears that do not go {{all the way around the}} circumference of the airway do not allow a lacerated airway to become completely detached; tears that encircle the whole airway can allow separation to occur. Lacerations may also be classified as complete or incomplete. In an incomplete lesion, a layer of tissue surrounding the bronchus remains intact and can keep the air in the airway, preventing it from leaking into the areas surrounding the airways. Incomplete lacerations may require closer scrutiny to detect and may not be diagnosed right away.|$|E

Saliva contains tissue factor which promotes the blood clotting mechanism.

25|$|Ashbrook and Powers {{consider}} {{it was an}} awareness of this problem – an inadequate buildup for Turandot's change of heart, combined with an overly successful treatment of the secondary character (Liù) – which contributed to Puccini's inability to complete the opera.

25|$|Spinal disc herniation, {{also known}} as a slipped disc, is a medical {{condition}} affecting the spine in which a tear in the outer, fibrous ring of an intervertebral disc allows the soft, central portion to bulge out beyond the damaged outer rings. Disc herniation is usually due to age-related degeneration of the outer ring, known as the anulus fibrosus, although trauma, lifting injuries, or straining have been implicated as well. <b>Tears</b> <b>are</b> almost always postero-lateral (on the back of the sides) owing to the presence of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the spinal canal. This tear in the disc ring may result in the release of chemicals causing inflammation, which may directly cause severe pain {{even in the absence of}} nerve root compression.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} the night in Grimshank's room and waking up as humans, Kröd and his men steal the vial of tears, throw the canine tooth {{out the window and}} tie up Grimshank. Kröd reveals to Aneka (India de Beaufort) and Ralph Longshaft (James Murray) that Grimshank is a traitor, but Grimshank insists he had to do it so that he could get close to Dongalor and stop him. Aneka is thrilled Kröd is still alive, but when Longshaft reveals that he and Aneka have been having sex, a disheartened Kröd gives him the Pagan tears, much to Grimshank's horror. Suddenly, Dongalor arrives with his army and Longshaft, who reveals himself to be the true traitor, gives him the tears. Kröd says the <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> fake and that he simply was trying to expose the real traitor, but Dongalor calls out his guards and takes the real tears from Kröd (Krod tries to swallow the vial, but ends up choking it up into Dongalor's hands: Aneka, Longshaft and Dongalor's advisor Barnabus (Alex MacQueen) then make cutting remarks about what he could have done with the vial). An annoyed Grimshank explains he planned to give the tears to Dongalor then use his powers to turn the weapon against him, but that he is now powerless without his canine tooth and cannot help. However, Loquasto, Zezelryck and Bruce arrive to fend off the guards and a battle ensues.|$|E
500|$|In 1997 American poet Frank Bidart wrote Desire, {{which was}} another retelling {{of the myth}} of Myrrha as it was {{presented}} in the Metamorphoses by Ovid. The case of Myrrha, critic Langdon Hammer notes, is the worst possible made against desire, because the story of Myrrha shows how sex can lead people to destroy others as well as themselves. He comments that [...] "the [...] "precious bitter resin" [...] into which Myrrha's <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> changed tastes bitter and sweet, like Desire as a whole". He further writes: [...] "The inescapability of desire makes Bidart's long story of submission to it a kind of affirmation. Rather than aberrant, the Ovidian characters come to feel exemplary".|$|E

500|$|Tøjner {{describes}} {{the work as}} [...] "Lichtenstein's finest formulation of a counter-image to the many explosions in his universe", noting that the drama is past its peak although it {{may seem to be}} at a crescendo. He also notes that [...] "the <b>tears</b> <b>are</b> drawn with classic Lichtenstein waxy fullness" [...] despite the surrounding water, which must be significant since [...] "naturalistic justification" [...] is absent. A November 1963 Art Magazine review stated that {{this was one of the}} [...] "broad and powerful paintings" [...] of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery. Nonetheless, the name of the work was not universally known. [...] In a December 1964 Art Magazine review of his October 24– September 19, 1964 Castelli Gallery show, Lichtenstein was referred to as the author of I Don't Care, I'd Rather Sink (Drowning Girl). According to Gary Garrels of the Museum of Modern Art, the work is a [...] "poetics of the utterly banal, of displaced ordinariness" [...] resulting in an [...] "image frozen in time and space", making it [...] "iconic". Comparing this to the source, Garrels says it is a rendering [...] "in a simplified vocabulary" [...] produced while Lichtenstein put aside his mechanical objectivity. According to The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, extreme examples of his formalization become [...] "virtual abstraction" [...] when the viewer recalls that the motif is an element of a larger work. Thus, Lichtenstein reinforced a non-realist view of comic strips and advertisements, presenting them as artificial images with minimalistic graphic techniques. Lichtenstein's magnification of his source material stressed the plainness of his motifs as an equivalent to mechanical commercial drawing, leading to implications about his statements on modern industrial America. Nonetheless, Lichtenstein appears to have accepted the American capitalist industrial culture.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To compare {{conventional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) and direct magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography {{in the evaluation of}} triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and intrinsic wrist ligament tears. Materials and Methods: T 1 -weighted, fat suppressed (FS) proton density plus T 2 -weighted (FS PD/T 2), 3 D multiple-echo data image combination (MEDIC) sequences and direct MR arthrography were performed in 53 patients with wrist pain. Images were evaluated for the presence and location of TFCC, scapholunate ligament (SLL) and lunatotriquetral ligament (LTL) tears, and imaging findings were compared with operative findings in 16 patients who underwent arthroscopy or open surgery (gold standard). Results: Sixteen patients underwent arthroscopy/open surgery: 12 TFCC <b>tears</b> <b>were</b> detected arthroscopically out of which 9 were detected on FS PD/T 2 sequence, 10 on MEDIC sequence, and all 12 were detected on MR arthrography. The sensitivities of FS PD/T 2, MEDIC sequences, and MR arthrography in the detection of TFCC <b>tears</b> <b>were</b> 75 %, 83. 3 %, and 100 %, respectively. Out of the eight arthroscopically confirmed SLL <b>tears,</b> three <b>tears</b> <b>were</b> detected on FS PD/T 2 sequence, five on MEDIC sequence, and all eight were visualized on MR arthrography. The sensitivities of FS PD/T 2, MEDIC sequences, and MR arthrography in detecting SLL <b>tears</b> <b>were</b> 37. 5 %, 62. 5 %, and 100 %, respectively. One arthroscopically confirmed LTL <b>tear</b> <b>was</b> diagnosed on FS PD/T 2 sequence, three on MEDIC sequence, and all five arthroscopically confirmed LTL <b>tears</b> <b>were</b> detected with MR arthrography. The sensitivities of PD, MEDIC sequences, and MR arthrography in detecting LTL <b>tears</b> <b>were</b> 20 %, 40 %, and 100 %, respectively. Conclusions: MR arthrography is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for the evaluation of wrist ligament tears...|$|R
