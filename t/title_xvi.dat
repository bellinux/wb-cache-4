50|$|Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a United States {{government}} program that provides stipends to low-income {{people who are}} either aged 65 or older, blind, or disabled. Although administered by the Social Security Administration, SSI is funded from the U.S. Treasury general funds, not the Social Security trust fund. SSI was created in 1974 to replace federal-state adult assistance programs that served the same purpose. The restructuring of these programs was intended to standardize the eligibility requirements and level of benefits. The new federal program was incorporated into <b>Title</b> <b>XVI</b> (Title 16) of the Social Security Act. Today the program provides benefits to approximately eight million Americans.|$|E
50|$|The SSI program, or <b>Title</b> <b>XVI</b> of the Social Security Act 1611, {{provides}} monthly federal {{cash assistance}} {{of up to}} $735 for an individual and $1,103 for a couple (as of 2017) to help meet the costs of basic needs of food, shelter and clothing. In most states, SSI eligibility usually assures concurrent access to important medical coverage under the various state Medicaid programs and sometimes access to Section 8 housing benefits. In some states, supplemental payments are made by the state, increasing the cash assistance available through SSI. For example, the state of California, through its State Supplementation Program (SSP), increases the cash assistance, making the total 2015 SSI benefit $889.40 per month.|$|E

At first Cibernético congratulated his partner but seemed reluctant to actually set a date for Chessman's title match.

5000|$|Over {{the years}} the {{emphasis}} of the program shifted to focus on youth development through marksmanship.

5000|$|The reality, however, did {{not nearly}} meet the written {{requirement}} of the law. For the first 20 years of the act’s existence, there was no regulation in place to define what constituted a [...] "reasonable volume" [...] or to ensure that hospitals were providing any free care at all. This did not improve until the early 1970s, when lawyers representing poor people began suing hospitals for not abiding by the law. Hill-Burton was set to expire in June 1973, but it was extended for one year in the last hour. In 1975, the Act was amended and became <b>Title</b> <b>XVI</b> of the Public Health Service Act. The most significant changes at this point were the addition of some regulatory mechanisms (defining what constitutes the inability to pay) and the move from a 20-year commitment to a requirement to provide free care in perpetuity.

An individual shall also be considered to be blind for purposes of this title if he is blind as defined under a State plan approved under title X or XVI as in effect for October 1972 and received aid under such plan (on the basis of blindness) for December 1973, so long as he is continuously blind as so defined.|$|E
