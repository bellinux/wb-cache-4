5|$|Legislation {{was signed}} by Governor Rick Snyder on December 27, 2014, to name the section of M-6 between Byron Center and Kalamazoo avenues the David John Warsen Memorial Highway.

5|$|The {{alignment}} of NY31E {{has not changed}} since that time; however, ownership of parts of the route has changed hands over the years. Until 1998, NY31E was state-maintained from its western terminus in Middleport to the Medina village line. On October1, 1998, ownership and maintenance of NY31E between NY271 in Middleport and the Niagara–Orleans county line was transferred from the state to Niagara County {{as part of a}} highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. <b>This</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route was subsequently co-designated, but not signed, as CR143 by Niagara County.|$|E

5|$|The nave and chancel {{are carried}} on five pairs of piers and the {{interior}} has a boarded wagon roof coloured in blue, crimson and gold which stretches the whole length of the church. At {{the time of the}} construction of the Bristol and Exeter Railway, William Froude – the engineer given responsibility for <b>this</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line by Isambard Kingdom Brunel – inserted iron stringers to prevent the walls from spreading as a result of vibrations from the trains.

5|$|The next {{interchange}} for the M-5 freeway {{connects to}} Grand River Avenue and 10 Mile Road. <b>This</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freeway bypasses residential areas of Farmington Hills. Further east, M-5 crosses into Farmington where it bypasses {{the downtown area}} of the suburb. Past 9Mile Road, the freeway ends at the intersection with Grand River Avenue, and M-5 follows Grand River southeasterly as a boulevard, a type of divided street. Traffic that wishes to make left turns must use a Michigan left maneuver along <b>this</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway. Additionally, traffic that needs to change sides of the street must use crossovers in the median to perform a U-turn. Once again running through suburban Farmington Hills, the trunkline passes Botsford Hospital before intersecting 8Mile Road. This intersection marks the place where M-5 crosses into Wayne County, and the western terminus of the M-102 designation on 8Mile Road. Grand River Avenue runs through the northern section of Redford Township in Wayne County and crosses into Detroit at the intersection with 7Mile Road and 5Points Street.|$|E

5|$|After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with {{a report}} of his success along with {{questions}} about the mission. Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, <b>this</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> History is usually known as the Libellus responsionum. Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on some issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, {{and when it was}} lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass. Other than the trip by Laurence, little is known of the activities of the missionaries in the period from their arrival until 601. Gregory mentions the mass conversions, and there is mention of Augustine working miracles that helped win converts, but there is little evidence of specific events.|$|E

5|$|Artist and {{inventor}} Bill Lishman created two sculptures for <b>this</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park, {{as well as}} {{some smaller}} works for application to the buildings. The most prominent is a dragon {{at the entrance to the}} Dragon Fire, which had originally been intended to hold a sign, but the park management decided they liked it enough for it to be a standalone sculpture. Lishman was allowed to design it from scratch, as opposed to follow preset designs established before he was hired, taking him and assistant Richard Van Heuvelan two months to complete. The other main sculpture was the wild boar at Wild Beast, both this and the dragon being built at his home in Blackstock, Ontario, for about $75,000. Signs by Lishman included Sherwood Florist, Boo Boo's Buggys, an ice cream cone, and for a popcorn counter.|$|E
