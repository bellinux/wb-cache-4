5|$|Brean Down is a {{site for}} the nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum apenninum), which occurs in {{abundance}} on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing near Bridgwater Bay, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae) Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild thyme, horseshoe vetch and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.|$|E
5|$|Caddisfly {{cases are}} open at both ends, the larvae drawing oxygenated water through the {{posterior}} end, over their gills, and pumping {{it out of}} the wider, anterior end. The larvae move around inside the tubes and this helps maintain the water current; the lower the oxygen content of the water, the more active the larvae need <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>This</b> mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support stonefly and mayfly larvae.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} milling. Typically, chemical milling is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the serial number is brought back to the surface. This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>This</b> removes any debris from the area left when the serial number was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an acid, that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic ferric chloride solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the geological interest of the site, the range of plants growing on Brean Down has led to it being designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The nationally rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum appenninum) is a common species at the site, occurring in abundance on {{the upper reaches of}} the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing here, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae).

5|$|Professor Layton and the Last Specter {{takes place}} {{three years before}} the events of Professor Layton and the Curious Village in a fictional English village known as Misthallery.

Lately, a monster who is believed by the town's population <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> specter has been attacking the village {{during the middle of}} the night, destroying homes and buildings.|$|E

5|$|The {{black vulture}} {{appears in a}} variety of Maya hieroglyphics in Mayan codices. It is {{normally}} connected with either death or as a bird of prey. The vulture's glyph is often shown attacking humans. This species lacks the religious connections that the king vulture has. While some of the glyphs clearly show the black vulture's open nostril and hooked beak, some are assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> species because they are vulture-like but lack the king vulture's knob and are painted black. This vulture has appeared on two stamps: those of Guyana in 1990 and Nicaragua in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The broadcast, {{aired on}} February 3, 2008, {{included}} excerpts from footage recorded from hidden cameras and microphones {{in the vehicle}} of Patrick van der Eem, a Dutch businessman and ex-convict who gained Van der Sloot's confidence. Van der Sloot was seen smoking marijuana and stating that he was with Holloway when she began convulsively shaking, then became unresponsive. Van der Sloot stated that he attempted to revive her, without success. He said that he called a friend, who told Van der Sloot {{to go home and}} who disposed of the body. An individual reputed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> friend, identified in the broadcast as Daury, has denied Van der Sloot's account, indicating that he was then in Rotterdam at school.|$|E

When the Soviet Union tested its first megaton device in 1955, the possibility of a limited nuclear war seemed even more remote in the public and political mind. Even cities and countries that were not direct targets would suffer fallout contamination. Extremely harmful fission products would disperse via normal weather patterns and embed in soil and water around the planet.|$|E
25|$|Havens {{are also}} {{closely related to}} the {{existence}} of separators, small sets X of vertices in an n-vertex graph such that every X-flap has at most 2n/3 vertices. If a graph G does not have a k-vertex separator, then every set X of at most k vertices has a (unique) X-flap with more than 2n/3 vertices. In this case, G has a haven of order , in which '(X) is defined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> unique large X-flap. That is, every graph has either a small separator or a haven of high order.|$|E
25|$|On December 23, 2012, on the 40th {{anniversary of}} the play just hours before the Steelers hosted the Cincinnati Bengals, the Steelers {{unveiled}} a monument at the exact spot where Harris made the reception at a parking lot just outside Heinz Field, where Three Rivers Stadium used <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>This</b> is the third such monument that commemorates the play in the city {{with the other two}} located at the Pittsburgh International Airport and the Heinz History Center.

25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others. People tend to focus on finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>This</b> also {{suggests that}} people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the loss}} of the titular character, Nation {{considered}} introducing a 'substitute Blake' character in Countdown, the third story he was scheduled to write that year. It can be speculated that the character of Del Grant, who appears in Countdown, was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> 'Blake substitute'. The 'Blake substitute' also appears in one of the early drafts of Allan Prior's episode Hostage. While Nation's original outline for the two-part series finale involved Jenna and Vila being killed, Boucher was aware that Gan's death had upset some viewers, and chose to have Blake and Jenna disappear from the narrative between the end of Star One and the opening story of Series Three. Travis was killed at the end of Star One, having no Blake upon whom to focus his vendetta against the Liberator crew.|$|E
25|$|The British central government's {{policy of}} {{cultural}} suppression against Highland culture culminated in 1747 when the Act of Proscription, which forbade {{the wearing of}} kilts by civilian males, went into effect. The Act was repealed in 1782 {{and in the early}} 19th century, there was something of a romanticisation of Highland culture (or such as it was imagined <b>to</b> <b>be).</b> <b>This</b> revival, later boosted greatly by Queen Victoria's enthusiasm for it, included the beginnings of the Highland games as we now know them. Highland dancing {{was an integral part of}} the Games from the very start of their modern revival, but the selection of dances performed at Games was intentionally narrowed down, mostly for the convenience of judges. Therefore, while the tradition of Highland games seemed at first glance to have fostered and preserved Highland dancing, many older dances got lost because nobody considered them worthwhile to practice, as they were not required for competition. The nature of these displays and competitions also affected the style of the dancing itself.|$|E

500|$|Two {{segments}} later, Big Bird interrupts the adults—Maria (Sonia Manzano), David (Northern Calloway), Bob (Bob McGrath), Susan (Loretta Long), Gordon, Luis (Emilio Delgado) and Olivia (Alaina Reed Hall)—discussing {{politics by}} giving them pictures he had drawn of each of them. He gets to Mr. Hooper's picture, saying that he would {{give it to him}} when he returns. The adults tearfully and emotionally explain to Big Bird that Mr. Hooper has died and he will never come back. Big Bird reacts by getting upset, expressing his confusion and sadness. The adults reassure him that they love him and will take care of him and David reveals that he would take over the store, Mr. Hooper having left it to him in his will. Big Bird asks, [...] "Why does it have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> way? Give me one good reason!" [...] and Gordon answers, [...] "Big Bird, it has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> way... just because." [...] Looking at Mr. Hooper's picture, Big Bird says, mispronouncing his name as he had done many times in the past, [...] "I'm going to miss you, Mr. Looper." [...] Maria tearfully corrects Big Bird and everyone gathers around him in support.|$|E
