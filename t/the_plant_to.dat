5|$|Daucus carota is a {{biennial}} plant. In {{the first}} year, its rosette of leaves produces {{large amounts of}} sugars, which are stored in the taproot to provide energy for <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> flower in the second year.|$|E
5|$|EVE {{brings the}} plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's {{recordings}} of Earth and concludes {{that they must}} return. However, AUTO refuses, revealing his own secret no-return directive A113, issued to BnL autopilots after the corporation concluded years earlier that the planet could not be saved. He mutinies, tasering WALL-E and deactivating EVE and throwing them both down the garbage chute, then detaining McCrea. EVE automatically reactivates and helps WALL-E bring <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> the ship's Holo-Detector chamber; AUTO tries to close the chamber, crushing WALL-E when he struggles to keep it open, but McCrea is able to deactivate him and destroy GO-4, while EVE inserts <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> activate the hyperjump.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{of large}} cooking pits (umu tī) {{can still be}} found in the hills of South Canterbury and North Otago, where large groves of cabbage trees still stand. Europeans used <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> make alcohol, and the often fearsome brews were relished by whalers and sealers.|$|E
50|$|A more {{advanced}} method, (aquaponics), being used experimentally in Egypt, is farming fish next <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> {{in a closed}} cycle. This allows <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> benefit from <b>the</b> ammonia excreted by the fish, helping <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> grow better {{and at the same}} time eliminating the need for changing the water for the fish, because <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> help <b>to</b> keep it clean by absorbing the ammonia. The fish also get some nutrients from the roots of <b>the</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ott {{discovered}} that <b>the</b> movement of <b>plants</b> could be manipulated by varying {{the amount of}} water <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> were given, and varying the color-temperature of the lights in the studio. Some colors caused <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> flower, and other colors caused <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> bear fruit. Ott discovered ways to change <b>the</b> sex of <b>plants</b> merely by varying the light source color-temperature.|$|R

5|$|In 1986–87, a {{cogeneration}} {{facility was}} added to the central heating plant to generate electricity from the plant's waste heat. A Cornell Combined Heat & Power Project, which was completed in December 2009, shifted the central heating plant from using coal to natural gas and enable <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> generate all of the campus's non-peak electric requirements.|$|E
5|$|In December 2003 the Environment Agency granted {{permission}} for <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> co-fire biomass fuels in the station. Since 2004 three {{different types of}} biomass fuel been in use at Lynemouth; Sawdust and Wood pellets from FSC certified forests and Olive residues. These fuels are mixed with the coal on the conveyor belt into the power station. In 2004 11,000 tonnes of biomass fuel {{were used in the}} station. Biomass conversion ambitions have increased, with the site currently aiming to be 100% biomass fired from 2015.|$|E
50|$|Ott also {{discovered}} that movement of plants could be manipulated by varying {{the amount of water}} that plants were given, and varying the color temperature of the lights in the studio, with some colors causing <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> flower and other colors causing <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> bear fruit. Ott even discovered ways to change <b>the</b> gender of <b>plants</b> merely by varying the light source color-temperature.|$|R

5|$|The Axioms {{passengers}} {{have become}} obese and feeble due to microgravity and reliance on an automated lifestyle, including the ship's current captain, McCrea, who leaves the ship {{under the control}} of the robotic autopilot, AUTO. EVE is taken to the bridge, with WALL-E tagging along. McCrea is unprepared for a positive probe response, but learns that placing EVE's plant in the ship's Holo-Detector for verification will trigger a hyperjump back to Earth so humanity can recolonize it. However, AUTO orders his robotic assistant GO-4 to steal <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> prevent this from happening.|$|E
5|$|The {{interrogation}} of German prisoners indicated that uranium and thorium were being processed in Germany, mostly at the Auergesellschaft plant at Oranienburg, so Groves arranged for <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> be bombed on 15 March 1945. Some 612 B-17 Flying Fortresses of the U.S. Eighth Air Force dropped 1,500 tons of high explosive and 178 tons of incendiary bombs on the plant.|$|E
5|$|The magical {{and mystical}} {{side of the}} herbal also lives on. Herbals often {{explained}} plant lore, displaying a superstitious or spiritual side. There was, for example, the fanciful doctrine of signatures, the belief that there were similarities in {{the appearance of the}} part of the body affected the appearance of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> be used as a remedy. The astrology of Culpeper can be seen in contemporary anthroposophy (biodynamic gardening) and alternative medical approaches like homeopathy, aromatherapy and other new age medicine show connections with herbals and traditional medicine.|$|E

5|$|The outflow {{from the}} works, which passes under the River Don Navigation and joins the river beside Jordans weir, {{has in the}} past been a major {{contributor}} to the pollution of the River Don, but some £70 million has been invested in upgrading <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> <b>to</b> ensure that discharges to the river meet the requirements of the Freshwater Fish Directive. In dry weather, the outfall discharges 30 million gallons (136,000m3) of treated water each day, more than doubling the flow in the river at this point.|$|E
5|$|Vanilla, {{originally}} a crop endemic to South America, {{was introduced in}} French Polynesia in 1848 by Admiral Ferdinand-Alphonse Hamelin, a French commander in the Pacific. The admiral delivered several dozen specimens of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> the Tahitian Governor's garden in Papeete. A new variety of vanilla was subsequently developed {{in the area and}} came to be popularly known as Tahitian vanilla. This has special characteristics compared to the varieties such as Vanilla planifolia grown {{in other parts of the}} world, particularly in respect to taste and scent. It has resulted in greater demand for the Tahitian variety.|$|E
5|$|Warren Anderson (Martin Sheen), the CEO of Union Carbide, visits <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> inspect its functionality, {{where he}} is briefed about a plan to connect two {{additional}} tanks for storage of methyl isocyanate to increase {{the output of the}} plant, ignoring the deteriorated condition of the tanks. Motwani meanwhile meets Eva Gascon (Mischa Barton), a reporter in the Paris Match, and persuades her to get an interview of Anderson. She impersonates the identity of an Associated Press reporter, but fails as her true identity is exposed in between the interview. Motwani convinces Dilip of the danger posed by the chemicals.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 2014, Airbus Helicopters will upgrade <b>the</b> Columbus <b>Plant</b> <b>to</b> a final {{assembly}} and test site for AS350 helicopters. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> plans <b>to</b> produce up to 60 additional AS350 helicopters annually by 2016.|$|R

50|$|An {{increase}} in crop yield can be simply summarized by the following: Simply by forcing <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> have more developed roots, <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> can more effectively absorb more nutrients and water.|$|R
5|$|Following their {{respective}} breeding seasons, {{several species of}} hummingbirds occur at the same locations in North America, and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats. These flowers have converged to a common morphology and color because these are effective at attracting the birds. Different lengths and curvatures of the corolla tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology. Tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill {{in a particular way}} when probing the flower, especially when the bill and corolla are both curved. This allows <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> place pollen on a certain part of the bird's body, permitting a variety of morphological co-adaptations.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the increasing revenue loss, the officials shut down the plant, firing most of the workers, including Dilip. The plant officials then order the usage of the remaining methyl isocyanate as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Dilip is busy with the wedding of his sister, and Roy has a final look of the control room. The safety measures fail and a runaway reaction follows. The faulty tanks cause the gas to start leaking, and an attempt to contain the leak fails. The gas escapes to the surroundings and is carried east by the wind. Motwani rushes to alert {{the people in the}} vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> vacate and head west, since the warning sirens were previously sabotaged. He meets Dilip, who ignores the warning and asks Motwani to leave the area without causing any hindrance to the wedding. Meanwhile, the guests experience irritation in the eyes and discomfort in breathing. Dilip senses the danger and visits the plant, realising that the plant had been compromised. He rushes back to his residence where he finds his family and relatives dying from acute exposure to the toxic gas. He carries away his son, paying farewell to his wife's corpse and flees the slum.|$|E
5|$|Originally, EVE {{would have}} been {{electrocuted}} by Auto, and then be quickly saved from ejection {{at the hands of}} the WALL-A robots by WALL-E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening, as he wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> the captain with repairing WALL-E, and it made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt. Stanton also moved the moment where WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship. Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film's end. Jim Capobianco, director of the Ratatouille short film Your Friend the Rat, created an end credits animation that continued the story—and stylized in different artistic movements throughout history—to clarify an optimistic tone.|$|E

5|$|Silencing systemin did {{not affect}} the ability of black {{nightshade}} to resist herbivory and, when competing against normal plants, silenced plants produced more above-ground biomass and berries. Upon herbivory, systemin was down-regulated in black nightshade in contrast to the other peptides which are up-regulated after herbivory. By contrast HypSys were up-regulated and activated the synthesis of protease inhibitors. The down-regulation of systemin was associated with increased root mass but did not decrease shoot mass, demonstrating that systemin can cause developmental changes as a result of herbivory, allowing <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> tolerate, rather than directly resist attack. Tomato roots were also affected by tomato systemin, with root growth increasing at high tomato systemin concentrations. By allocating more resources to the roots, plants under attack are thought to store carbon and then use it to re-grow when the attack ends. Overexpressing AtPEP1 also increased root and shoot biomass in A. thaliana.|$|E
5|$|The Rhynia {{plant was}} small and stick-like, with simple dichotomously {{branching}} stems without leaves, each tipped by a sporangium. The simple form echoes that of the sporophyte of mosses, {{and it has been}} shown that Rhynia had an alternation of generations, with a corresponding gametophyte in the form of crowded tufts of diminutive stems only a few millimetres in height. Rhynia thus falls midway between mosses and early vascular plants like ferns and clubmosses. From a carpet of moss-like gametophytes, the larger Rhynia sporophytes grew much like simple clubmosses, spreading by means of horizontal growing stems growing rhizoids that anchored <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> the substrate. The unusual mix of moss-like and vascular traits and the extreme structural simplicity of the plant had huge implications for botanical understanding.|$|E
5|$|The {{desalination}} plant {{was impossible to}} hide, and since it had been built by the Italians, the enemy knew exactly where and what it was. Proud and Murray Dixon therefore disguised <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> look {{as if it had}} been destroyed by a bomb. A trompe l'oeil black hole was painted over the top and one side of the building, along with shrapnel marks, shortly after a real attack which fortunately missed the plant; a disused chimney was actually demolished; real rubble, empty oil drums and real wrecked vehicles, which were in plentiful supply, were brought to decorate the compound; and some fake craters were constructed and decorated as if a stick of bombs had fallen right on target. The finishing touch was some real smoke from burning oily rags. The plant was not attacked again.|$|E
50|$|This section {{tries to}} explain why the nature makes flowers so {{beautiful}} and smelling. The answer is simple: to attract insect which, unaware, move pollen from one <b>plant</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next, allowing <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> reproduce.|$|R
50|$|Threshing is {{the process}} of {{removing}} the seeds from the rest of <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> Separating <b>the</b> usable flax fibers from other components requires pulling the stems through a hackle and/or beating <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> break them.|$|R
