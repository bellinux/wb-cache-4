5|$|John Chrysostom, deacon at Antioch from 381, {{was made}} priest in 386. As a special distinction, his bishop, Flavian, {{decided that he}} should preach in the city's {{principal}} church. Chrysostom's contribution to <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> Philip and Christianity is a homily on Babylas, a martyr-bishop who died in 253, during the Decian persecution. The treatise was composed about 382, when John was a deacon, and forms part of Chrysostom's corpus of panegyrics. Chrysostom's Babylas confronts an emperor; and, since Chrysostom {{is more interested in}} the bishop than his opponent, the emperor goes unnamed. He has since been identified with Philip.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} of energy technology has begun to reflect the interactions between the current electrical grid and future energy technology.

If this is not done, a given class of energy technology may emit more CO2 over its lifetime than it mitigates.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we assess how {{important}} “industry ” is to innovation. Our empirical estimates suggest that “industry factors ” are, at most, only moderately important for R&D, innovation and innovative {{performance at the}} firm level. The results offer empirical support to recent evolutionary theorizing stressing that firms have heterogeneous innovative capabilities and hence differ in terms of performance. But {{from the perspective of}} the economy as a whole, “industry effects ” are still important. This lends empirical support to <b>the</b> <b>literatures</b> <b>on</b> “technological regimes ” and “sectoral innovation systems”. We conclude by arguing that recent evolutionary theory and <b>the</b> <b>literatures</b> <b>on</b> technological regimes and sectoral innovation systems complement each other and enrich our understanding of innovation. 1 I thank Martin Srholec and Bart Verspagen for helpful comments and suggestions on an earlier draft of this paper. 2 1...|$|R
