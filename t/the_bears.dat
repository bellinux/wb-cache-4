5|$|Against the Baltimore Ravens in week twelve, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> wore their 1940s {{alternate}} uniforms. <b>The</b> <b>Bears</b> last {{played the}} Ravens in 2009, which {{ended with a}} Baltimore 31–7 victory. With Jay Cutler still out, Josh McCown continued to play as quarterback for <b>the</b> <b>Bears,</b> who had the eighth-best passing offense in the league with 261.7 yards per game, which competed against the Ravens' 18th-ranked pass defense. On the ground, the Ravens had the tenth-best rushing D with 102.6 rushing yards allowed per game, but offensively, had the 30th-ranked rushing offense, averaging just 73.1 yards per game, going against Chicago's defense which allowed 129.4 rushing yards per game. Against Joe Flacco, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> {{had the opportunity to}} force turnovers, as Flacco had thrown eleven interceptions in the previous nine games. For <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> on offense, a liability was to protect McCown from Terrell Suggs and Elvis Dumervil, who combined for 17 of 32 sacks by the Ravens. Two parties had the majority favoring <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> for the game: 10 of 13 ESPN analysts predicted a Bears victory, with Ron Jaworski, Seth Wickersham and Cris Carter being the only three to predict a win for Baltimore. CBS Sports analysts predicted the Ravens would win in a 5–4 vote.|$|E
5|$|Chicago entered week sixteen with {{a chance}} to clinch the NFC North in the event that the Packers and Lions lost. The Packers and Lions {{eventually}} lost to the Steelers and Giants, respectively, putting <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> in position to win the division by defeating the Eagles. The last game between <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> and Eagles was in 2011, when <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> won 30–24; <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> also lead the all-time series 30–12–1, though the Eagles had won six of the last ten meetings. However, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> had won four of five meetings between the two teams in the last six years, but all by less than six points. One of the Bears' keys to victory is to prevent LeSean McCoy from dominating; <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> had the worst run defense in the league, while McCoy leads the league in rushing. Chicago's defense also must contain the Eagles' fast-scoring offense: the Eagles had the lowest average time of possession per drive at 2:24, while the league average is 3:27. Philadelphia also is the only team in the league to score in fewer than seven plays per drive. In the passing game, Chicago had the fourth-best passing offense, while the Eagles were 26th in pass defense. However, the Eagles are ranked sixth in rushing defense.|$|E

50|$|When a <b>bear</b> enters <b>the</b> lab {{from the}} nearby forest, both Bugs and Elmer mistake <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> for one another (Bugs seeing <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> wear Elmer's hat and Elmer later seeing <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> eat a carrot), until Elmer becomes angry at <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> (still {{thinking}} that it's Bugs Bunny) after <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> refuses <b>the</b> potion {{that was going to}} cure him, which was the same potion Bugs gave to <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> earlier and of which made <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> disgusted.

Elmer, after heeding Bugs' option, plays dead to fool <b>the</b> <b>bear,</b> and is saved by his bad odor (just as with Wabbit Twouble). Elmer thinks he's safe until he thinks he hears <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> again, but it's Bugs this time, imitating <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> (again, lifted from Wabbit Twouble). Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>bear</b> is standing {{on the side of the}} room watching them, convinced that both Elmer and Bugs are crazy, flashing rebus picture cards to the audience showing a , a , a , , etc. (a gag Bugs had done earlier when Elmer was freaking out after drinking the potion).|$|R

During his award acceptance speech, Urlacher thanked <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> for their support after his mother Lavoyda Lenard died. Against the Tennessee Titans in Week 9, Urlacher intercepted Matt Hasselbeck, and returned the pick 46 yards for a touchdown. Urlacher led <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> in tackles until Week 13 against the Seahawks, in which he sustained a hamstring injury that sidelined him {{for the remainder of}} the season. Urlacher became an unrestricted free agent on March 12, 2013. On March 20, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> announced that Urlacher will not return in 2013 after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a new contract. Urlacher later belittled Phil Emery's contract negotiations with him as 'lip service', and stated <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> had little intention to re-sign him. In 2015, Urlacher told ESPN that he still respected <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> organization and front office, but has yet to speak to Emery, who was fired in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In week two, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> donned their 1940s {{alternate}} uniforms against rival Minnesota, in {{the second}} home game of the season, marking {{the first time since}} 1999 that <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> hosted the first two games of the regular season. During the two games played between the rivals last season, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> won the first game 28–10, while the Vikings won the second 21–14. Since 2001, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> led the series 16–10. ESPN writes that <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> could capitalize on the Vikings' tendency to turn the ball over, as they gave away the ball to the Detroit Lions four times in week one. Chicago's defense should also prevent NFL MVP Adrian Peterson, who had been struggling when playing <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> at Soldier Field. Since 2009, Peterson has been able to record only 73 rushing yards per game.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bears</b> {{ended the}} regular season at home against the Lions; in Chicago, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> led the series 50–26–3. Jeff Joniak writes that <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> offense had to hold off the blitz; in 2015, the Lions had 38 sacks, {{including}} 13.5 by defensive end Ezekiel Ansah, and ranked fourth in sack percentage, while recording the second-most negative plays in the NFL. In comparison, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> had the fewest negative plays in the league. Despite the frequency to blitz, the Lions only had eight sacks when doing so. Through the air, the Lions pass defense struggled, allowing a 30th-ranked passer rating of 101.7 and 30 touchdown passes while recording only interceptions. To excel, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> had to maintain the ball, as they were ranked sixth in the NFL in time of possession. On defense, <b>the</b> <b>Bears</b> took on a Lions offense that had improved under offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter after Joe Lombardi's firing, going from 18.6 points per game to 26.4 under Cooter. With Matthew Stafford, the Lions were one of eleven teams with over 4,000 yards, while also being {{ranked in the top}} ten with 30 touchdown passes. However, Stafford was sacked 40 times, while the rushing attack averaged only 84.5 yards per game and 3.8 yards per carry. Eddie Royal, Zach Miller, Hroniss Grasu, Jarvis Jenkins, Jacoby Glenn, Tayo Fabuluje and Terry Williams were inactive.|$|E
