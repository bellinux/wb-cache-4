2500|$|For {{the role}} of the evil Asa and her {{innocent}} descendant Katia, Bava noted: [...] "A strange type was needed, and we chose Steele from pictures." [...] Bava reportedly found Steele difficult to work with. According to Bava, the actress [...] "was somewhat irrational, afraid of Italians. One day she refused to come to the set, because somebody <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> using a special film-stock that made people appear naked." [...] Steele recalled: [...] "Lord alone knows I was difficult enough. I didn't like my fangs – I had them changed three times. I loathed my wig – I changed that four times. I couldn't understand Italian. I certainly didn't want to allow them to tear open my dress and expose my breasts, so they got a double that I didn't like at all, so I ended up doing it myself – drunk, barely over eighteen, embarrassed and not very easy to be around." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{her fifth}} album, Ciara {{contributed to both}} the writing and {{production}} of the album's songs. She wrote [...] "Sweat" [...] (featuring 2 Chainz), a song that was originally {{supposed to be the}} album's first single when the album was called One Woman Army. Ciara also co-wrote and co-produced [...] "Sorry", the song that was chosen to supersede [...] "Sweat" [...] as one of One Woman Armys two lead singles, along with [...] "Got Me Good", also written by Ciara. None of these records made the final album. [...] "Sorry" [...] was co-written and co-produced by Jasper Cameron, who previously worked with Ciara on her 2006 single [...] "Promise" [...] and 2009 single [...] "Never Ever". Together the duo wrote and produced [...] "Super Turnt Up" [...] which did make the final listing for Ciara. [...] "Got Me Good" [...] was co-written with Rodney Jerkins and Livvi Franc (Olivia Waith). When interviewed by Rap-Up TV, Jerkins said [...] "I had a meeting with her about what her future holds and I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there if she ever needed my creative juices, so hopefully me and her get in the studio and work." [...] Jerkins previously produced records for [...] and Fantasy Ride.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Perhaps, if you haven't {{tried to}} make her, you have tried to prevent <b>her.</b> Haven't you <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> unsuccessful, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> poor?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>'er</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> coming {{straight}} away to drownd myself," [...] pursued Mr. Heard. [...] "My last words to 'er was, 'When {{you see my}} bloated corpse you'll be sorry.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} <b>told</b> <b>her</b> who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> after all, or {{found out the}} {{particulars}} of Ambrose's history,' she murmured. 'But her being in love alters everything.' ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{ready to}} explain my self, {{if she would}} give me her Word, she would not resent it, and would take nothing ill.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{mother gave}} me the lunch," [...] said Horace Kelsey, as he handed the basket to Ralph. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> coming down to see you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I met {{the owner}} in Rome last winter. It {{belongs to a}} Mrs. Craddock, and when I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> looking out for a house, she {{suggested}} that I should come and see this.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Fanny's good-humoured face cleared up. 'Yes, ma'am, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{quite sure}} that Miss Gillian would not go for to do {{anything}} wrong, {{and that it could}} be easy explained; but people has tongues, you see.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're too impatient," [...] {{concluded}} Sampson. [...] "You'll ruin {{any chance}} of happiness if you rush Diane. She might be won. If you <b>told</b> <b>her</b> who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> she'd hate you forever. She might marry you to save me, but she'd hate you.|$|R
6000|$|About a {{year after}} he was adopted, Alder met that poor mother, whose little one the Indians had cruelly murdered before her eyes. [...] "When she saw me, she came smiling, and asked if it <b>was</b> me. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> it <b>was.</b> She asked me how <b>I</b> had <b>been.</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> very unwell, for I had had fever and ague for a long time. So she took me off to a log, and there we sat down; and she combed my head, and asked a great many {{questions}} about how I lived, and if I didn't {{want to see my}} mother and little brothers. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> glad to see them, but never expected to see them again. We took many a cry together, and when we parted, took our last and final farewell, for <b>I</b> never saw <b>her</b> again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Missis Gummidge,' he returned, 'not {{being a good}} scholar, sir, Ham kindly drawed it out, and {{she made}} a copy on it. They <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> gone to seek her, and what my parting words was.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't a notion. She {{walked into}} Brown's hotel {{yesterday}} looking played out and anxious, and said somebody had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{going to the}} Bluff. As I {{felt sorry for her}} I started at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course they}} are; Cousin Marilda, in a bonnet like a {{primrose}} bank, is {{to pick up}} Fernan somewhere, but I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> too true to my principles to let wild horses drag me there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{thought that}} Burgundy could, or would do so, I would inform {{him as well}} as Aquitaine what is doing; but {{in the first place}} he has not the power, and in the second he would not have the will. What are a few score of lives to him, and those mostly of men of the Orleanist faction, in {{comparison}} with the support of Paris? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> vexed, too, at this failure of Simon, that is to say, if it be a failure. That we shall know by mid-day. My daughter will meet him in the Place de Grève at eleven, and we shall hear when she comes back how much he has <b>told</b> <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going after breakfast to my booth outside the walls, where you first saw me. I must send notes to the three gentlemen whom I know, begging them to see me there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is {{not expecting}} me, as it happens," [...] Draconmeyer lied smoothly. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> might <b>be</b> dining at the Villa Mimosa. <b>I</b> have to <b>be</b> there later on." ...|$|R
6000|$|Emboldened by {{her beauty}} and gentleness, I ventured to reply, [...] "Before, madam, I answer your question, {{allow me to}} say how {{grateful}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> for this meeting, which {{is not only a}} consolation to me in my own heavy sorrow, but may perhaps enable me to render your lot happier," [...] and then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> who <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> and how <b>I</b> had come there.|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll do that," [...] said David. [...] "He did it last time. My dear missis could scarce {{believe her}} ears when I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> converted, or {{her eyes when}} she saw the Bethel-flag and the temperance pledge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{unworthy of}} her--that was when I {{believed}} {{her to be}} an angel. I promised to begin a new life for her sake. Then she promised me--helped me--and all the while she was false to me--false as a hell-cat!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{did not see}} Fitzjocelyn again till nearly dinner-time; and, as {{he caught}} her anxious {{interrogating}} eye, he came to her and said, very low, 'I was not let in; Miss Ponsonby was engaged. Miss Mary lying down--I believe they never <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> {{the last}} person to wish to tempt her to selfishness, but that I did not think that either could be easy in {{settling}} such a matter through a third person." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was a great}} {{shock to}} every one," [...] Arnold went on. [...] "Mrs. Weatherley arrived {{about a quarter of}} an hour before it occurred. I {{understood}} that she was expecting to lunch with him, but when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> why <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there she came and sat at my table. She was sitting there when it happened. She was very much upset indeed. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> detained looking after her." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{says she}} shall stop till I come back, as {{she wants to}} see me again before she goes. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> might not <b>be</b> back for a month. She said it didn't matter; she had plenty of time, and would wait for me.|$|R
6000|$|When {{she thanked}} {{me for being}} so REASONABLE I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> [...] not doing it to please her, but for Paul's sake, because I [...] would not spoil his life, and that I would always hate her. [...] She smiled again and went away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. It {{was terrible}} {{she seemed to}} feel so. And I was sorry for her. I thought I ought to answer it, and I did. I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sorry, too. I tried not to blame Richard. I don't believe I did. And I tried not to blame him. She was feeling badly enough without that." ...|$|E
60|$|I hadn't seen {{my mother}} {{in a year or}} so. And when I got there she knew my face; knew I was married; knew I had a family, and that I was living with them. But she couldn't, for the life of her, tell my name or who I was. So I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> her boy.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> left in {{my study}} in a very {{unpleasant}} state of mind. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> agitated and apprehensive. Perhaps that young woman would not come any more. <b>I</b> had not <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to stop writing about love, and there was every reason to suppose she would not return. What an imbecile <b>I</b> had <b>been!</b> <b>I</b> had done nothing, because I {{could not think of}} exactly the right thing to do.|$|R
60|$|They <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{on my way}} home, and {{she said}} with a {{confident}} smile, ‘He will come as quick as trains can bring him.’ That is my reward, that <b>is</b> what <b>I</b> have got for my books. Everything I could do for her in this life I have done since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a boy; <b>I</b> look back through the years and I cannot see the smallest thing left undone.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is very extraordinary," [...] Lady Anne remarked, [...] "that she should be willing to take a {{secretary}} who knows nothing of typewriting or shorthand. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> how ignorant <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> but she didn't seem to mind much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It wasn't the spiteful stag after all, but we {{had such}} {{a long way to}} come home, and got over the park wall at last by the help of the limb of a tree. We had been taking a bit of wedding-cake to Frank Somerville's old nurse, and Kitty <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> her maiden aunt, and we had such fun---her uncle's wife's sister, you know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never been before. Never seen {{a person}} {{here in my}} life before--except you and Miss Olive. Came on a bet. Chap bet I wouldn't dare come without being invited. I came. Bowed to the hostess and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so sorry my play-rehearsals made me late, {{and she was so}} glad I could come, after all--you know. She's never seen me in her life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My good opinion makes {{allowance}} {{for the state}} of my poor darling's mind, after the shock that has fallen on her," [...] Alban answered quietly. [...] "She is not my Emily now. She will be my Emily yet. I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> convinced of it, in the old days at school--and my conviction is as strong as ever. Have you seen her, since I have been away at Netherwoods?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> read <b>her</b> letter many times. <b>I</b> {{wrote to}} <b>her</b> before <b>I</b> slept. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> in sore need of her help; that without <b>her</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not, and <b>I</b> never had <b>been,</b> {{what she thought}} me; but that she {{inspired}} me to <b>be</b> that, and <b>I</b> would try.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> <b>her</b> brother, {{and that}} as long as I had a {{shilling}} she should never want sixpence. And I mean it. And as for what you say about romance and repenting it, that simply comes from your being a lawyer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're too impatient," [...] {{concluded}} Longstreth. [...] "You'll ruin {{any chance}} of happiness if you rush Ray. She might be won. If you <b>told</b> <b>her</b> who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> she'd hate you for ever. She might marry you to save me, but she'd hate you. That isn't the way. Wait. Play for time. Be different with her. Cut out your drinking. She despises that. Let's plan to sell out here--stock, ranch, property--and leave the country. Then you'd have a show with her." ...|$|R
