5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{representative}} peers {{were those}} peers {{elected by the}} members of the Peerage of Scotland and the Peerage of Ireland <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the British House of Lords. Until 1999, all members of the Peerage of England held the right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the House of Lords; they did not elect a limited group of representatives. All peers who were created after 1707 as Peers of Great Britain and after 1801 as Peers of the United Kingdom held the same right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|The Peerage Act 1963 allowed all Scottish peers <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the House of Lords; it also {{permitted}} all Irish peers <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the House of Commons for any constituency in the United Kingdom, {{as well as}} to vote in parliamentary elections, {{without being}} deprived of the remaining privileges of peerage.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{aircraft}} was fully booked, a passenger was allowed <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the jump {{seat in the}} cockpit. The passenger had no connection with the airline, but was granted permission by the captain via acquaintance in the airline. Several of the other passengers were employees in Widerøe and shouldaccording to the airline's rulesinstead have been seated there. From Namsos to Brønnøysund there were available seats in the cabin, but the jump seat passenger continued <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the cockpit. The commission felt that the passenger's conversation with the captain drew his attention and concentration away from his duties at a critical point of the flight. This also disrupted communication between the two pilots, resulting in the mutual control being disrupted.|$|E

5|$|The Privileges Committee {{unanimously}} {{found that}} the Articles of Union would not be breached by the House of Lords Bill if it were enacted. The bill did receive Royal Assent, and from 1999, hereditary peers {{have not had the}} automatic right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Under the Peerage Act 1963, all Scottish peers {{procured}} {{the right}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the House of Lords, {{and the system}} of electing representative peers was abolished. Scottish as well as British and English hereditary peers lost their automatic right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the Upper House {{with the passage of}} the House of Lords Act 1999. During the debate on the House of Lords Bill, a question arose as to whether the proposal would violate the Treaty of Union. In suggesting that the Bill did indeed violate the Articles of Union, it was submitted that, prior to Union, the Estates of Parliament, Scotland's old, pre-Union parliament, was entitled to impose conditions, and that one fundamental condition was a guarantee of representation of Scotland in both Houses of Parliament at Westminster. It was implied, furthermore, that the Peerage Act of 1963 did not violate the requirement of Scottish representation, set out in the Article XXII of the Treaty of Union, by allowing all Scottish peers <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the House of Lords: as long as a minimum of sixteen seats were reserved for Scotland, the principles of the Article would be upheld. It was further argued that the only way to rescind the requirement of Article XXII would be to dissolve the Union between England and Scotland, which the House of Lords Bill did not seek to do.|$|E
5|$|A {{leader of}} a party is chosen by the party, {{following}} an internal constitution unique to each party that comprises a framework to elect or appoint a leader. The leader, {{if he or she}} does not already have a seat, must then win a seat in a by-election or general election <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the Assembly. If a {{leader of a}} party does not have a seat, he or she must sit in the legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.|$|E
5|$|As {{the teams}} {{prepared}} to leave their dressing rooms, Manchester City deliberately delayed their exit by a short period to play on any nerves the Leicester City players may have had. Manchester City coach Malcolm Allison was not permitted {{to take his place}} on the bench, as he was serving a touchline ban. Instead, he had <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the stand behind the dugout. Before kick-off, the players were introduced to the guest of honour, Princess Anne.|$|E

5|$|At {{the back}} of the race, Bourdais began a slow climb back up the field. The Toro Rosso driver passed Sutil (who later spun out and retired with a gearbox problem), Nakajima and Coulthard, <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> 15th by lap30. Rosberg fought Glock for 12th, until he passed the Toyota at the turn14 hairpin on lap12. Rosberg's pit stop relegated him to 18th, {{dropping}} six places. Kubica pitted late, on lap25, dropping from third to ninth, one position outside of the points.|$|E
5|$|Coulthard and Button {{collided}} on lap18 when Button {{attempted to}} pass the Red Bull on the inside at turn eight; the Honda lost its front wing and retired a lap later after two pit stops. Hamilton continued his climb back through the field; he moved from 18th, passing Piquet, Davidson, Sutil and Bourdais in separate manoeuvres, <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> 14th {{by the time he}} pitted on lap31. Piquet retired on lap42 with transmission failure, requiring a gearbox change before the next race.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Overton {{was known}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> his bases' chapel {{in silence for}} {{extended}} periods of time, not praying, to calm his nerves. He also began to grow a mustache, though he professes not to be superstitious. Overton would continue to grow this mustache until immediately before his final flight, when he shaved it off. He also believed any number with a three in it, including the number 13, was lucky.|$|E

5|$|In April 1989, Bush {{arranged}} {{for a group of}} investors to purchase a controlling interest in the Texas Rangers baseball franchise for $89M and invested $500K himself to start. He then served as managing general partner for five years. He actively led the team's projects and regularly attended its games, often choosing <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the open stands with fans. Bush's sale of his shares in the Rangers in 1998 brought him over $15million from his initial $800,000 investment.|$|E
5|$|Incumbent Prime Minister Kiviniemi {{said that}} she was ready to work with any party in Finland. When pressed by the media she {{said that she}} would not rule out working with the True Finns pending {{cooperation}} on negotiating a government platform. The True Finns and the Green League have both confirmed that the two parties are ideologically too far from each other <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the same coalition. The True Finns' main campaign issues—lowering refugee quotas and cutting foreign aid and Finland's financial contribution to the EU—were seen as a possible hindrance to coalition talks.|$|E
5|$|Purified water {{should be}} used for {{watering}} purposes, although 'hard water' is tolerated. This is done to minimise the build-up of minerals and chemicals in the soil. Water purity greater than 100p.p.m. of total dissolved solids is often quoted as ideal. A reverse osmosis unit can be used to filter the water or, alternatively, bottled distilled water can be purchased. Watering should be done regularly. However, plants should not be allowed <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> water, as this may lead to root rot.|$|E

5|$|Scotland {{was allowed}} to elect sixteen {{representative}} peers, while Ireland could elect twenty-eight. Those chosen by Scotland sat for a single term, and following each dissolution new Scottish peers were elected. In contrast, Irish representative peers sat for life. Elections for Irish peers ceased when the Irish Free State came into existence as a Dominion in December 1922. However, already-elected Irish peers continued {{to be entitled to}} sit until their death. Elections for Scottish peers ended in 1963, when all Scottish peers obtained the right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the House of Lords.|$|E
