25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>riots</b> of 1992, {{also known}} as the Rodney King {{uprising}} or the Rodney King riots, began on April 29, 1992 when a jury acquitted four LAPD police officers accused in the videotaped beating of an African American Rodney King following a high-speed car pursuit on March 3, 1991.|$|E

25|$|The 1960s saw race {{relations}} boil {{over into the}} Watts Riots of 1965 which resulted in 34 deaths and over 1,000 injuries. It was the most severe riot in the city's history until <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>riots</b> of 1992. In 1969, Los Angeles became {{the birthplace of the}} Internet, as the first ARPANET transmission was sent from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to SRI in Menlo Park.|$|E
25|$|Reaction {{to police}} {{brutality}} {{resulted in the}} Watts riots of 1965 and again, after the Rodney King beating, in <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>riots</b> of 1992. Charges of police brutality dogged the Department {{through the end of}} the 20th century. In the late 1990s, as a result of the Rampart scandal involving misconduct of 70 officers, the federal government was forced to intervene and assumed jurisdiction of the Department with a consent decree. Police reform has since been a major issue confronted by L.A.'s recent mayors.|$|E
25|$|In March 1991, {{members of}} the Los Angeles Police Department harshly beat an African American suspect, Rodney King, while a white {{civilian}} videotaped the incident, leading to extensive media coverage and criminal charges against several of the officers involved. In April 1992, hours after the four police officers involved were acquitted at trial, <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>riots</b> of 1992 commenced, causing 53 deaths, 2,383 injuries, more than 7,000 fires, damage to 3,100 businesses, and nearly $1 billion in financial losses. After facing federal trial, {{two of the four}} officers were convicted and received 32 months prison sentence. The case was widely seen as a key factor in the reform of the Los Angeles Police Department.|$|E

As Idol explained for MTV News, he had originally created the song with an entirely different set of lyrics, but upon witnessing the riots on television he immediately rewrote and recorded them that day. Idol {{explained that he was}} trying to capture the political and economic conflict that had created the LA Riots. Idol further felt that the camcorder – as displayed in the witnessing of the Rodney King beating – was a [...] "potent way of conveying ideas" [...] and an important metaphor for technology used in rebellion.|$|E

However, Green also criticized local officials for expecting [...] "them [...] to come and run the whole show". Some FEMA officials responded {{that it was impossible to}} respond as they had been requested while also continuing to provide aid for <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>riots.</b> FEMA spokesman Grant Peterson stated, [...] "24 hours is not reasonable to expect to have all the resources of the federal government landing in the middle of a disaster." ...|$|E

500|$|President Bush avoided federal antipoverty issues, {{and instead}} used Kemp as a {{mouthpiece}} {{to speak on}} the administration's low priority conservative activist agenda. Bush's contribution to the urban agenda had been volunteerism through his [...] "Points of Light" [...] theme, and Kemp received stronger support for his ideas from Presidential candidate Bill Clinton. By the time of <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>riots</b> of 1992, Bush was a bit late in supporting enterprise zones, tenant ownership and welfare reform: [...] Mort Zuckerman compared Bush's vision on racial issues {{to that of a}} man riding backwards in a railroad car. Nonetheless, the riots made Kemp a focal point of the administration, even though at first, Kemp had been overlooked. However, Charles E. Schumer had probably summarized the prospects of Kemp's success in advance best when he said in 1989, [...] "Good ideas with money can do a whole lot. Good ideas without money aren't probably going to do a whole lot," [...] and the issue here was the decision not to fund Kemp's ideas. Although Kemp was unable to procure money for his visions, he was among the administration's leading users of first class corporate jets. He cited lingering effects from a knee injury as the reason he had to fly first class at government expense as the Housing Secretary.|$|E

2500|$|The riots, {{the largest}} urban {{disorder}} in the United States since <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>riots</b> of 1992, effectively killed the Over-the-Rhine renaissance {{of the late}} 1990s and set the neighborhood back a decade. Police, who felt scapegoated {{as the cause of}} the riots, began an unofficial [...] "work slowdown" [...] where they made far fewer arrests and some began looking for jobs in the suburbs. Crime increased by double digits and within months of the unrest nearly 20% of Section 8 voucher holders left Over-the-Rhine. The following year a crowd of [...] "300 black people," [...] which had initially formed to watch a fight between two young black teens, blocked Vine Street in Over-the-Rhine while there were [...] "attacks on cars driven by white people." [...] Businesses moved to other neighborhoods because customers were too frightened to visit Over-the-Rhine, and Main Street lost much of its nightlife to places like Newport, Northside, and Hyde Park.|$|E

2500|$|That {{changed on}} January 8, 2008, {{the day of}} the New Hampshire primary, when The New Republic {{published}} a story by James Kirchick filled with quotes from the newsletters. Kirchick said that the writings showed [...] "an obsession with conspiracies, sympathy for the right-wing militia movement, and deeply held bigotry", and were [...] "saturated in racism", charges echoed by Kevin Drum of the Washington Monthlys Political Animal blog. Kirchick noted that one article referred to African-American rioters as [...] "barbarians" [...] and suggested that <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>riots</b> of 1992 only stopped {{when it came time for}} [...] "blacks to pick up their welfare checks". An article entitled [...] "The Pink House" [...] said that [...] "homosexuals, not to speak of the rest of society, were far better off when social pressure forced them to hide their activities." [...] Other issues gave tactical advice to local militia groups on how to evade detection by the authorities and advanced various conspiracy theories.|$|E
2500|$|On March 16, 1991, a year {{prior to}} <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>riots,</b> {{storekeeper}} Soon Ja Du physically confronted black ninth-grader Latasha Harlins by grabbing her sweater and backpack {{over whether the}} 15-year-old {{had been trying to}} steal a bottle of orange juice from Empire Liquor, the store Du's family owned in Compton. After Latasha hit Du, Du shot Latasha {{in the back of the}} head, killing her. (Security tape showed the girl, already dead, was still clutching $2 in her hand when investigators arrived.) Du was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and forced to pay a fine of $500, but not sentenced to any prison time. As a result, relations between the African-American and Korean communities significantly worsened, and the former became increasingly mistrustful of the criminal justice system. Racial tensions had been simmering underneath the surface for several years. Many African Americans were angry toward a growing Korean merchant community in South Central Los Angeles earning a living in their communities, and felt disrespected and looked down on by many Korean merchants. Cultural differences and a language barrier further fueled tensions in an already fragile environment. [...] The probation Soon Ja Du received for killing Latasha Harlins combined with the acquittal of the four LAPD officers in Rodney King's trial resulted in the ensuing Los Angeles riots, and much of that anger was directed at Koreans.|$|E
