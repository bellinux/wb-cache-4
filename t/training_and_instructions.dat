The amount of improvement varies inversely with the severity of memory impairment, but is largely unrelated to either the aetiology or the locus of brain damage. It also appears to depend on the patients' motivation rather than their intelligence, education or imagery ability. However, brain-damaged patients may need explicit prompting if they are to use imagery mnemonics successfully and often fail to maintain their use on similar learning materials or to generalise their use to new learning situations. As a result, imagery mnemonics will typically be of little practical value in enabling memory-impaired individuals to respond to the cognitive challenges of everyday life...|$|E

40|$|Validity {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} factors concerning surveillance of nosocomial infections (NIs). This article describes the first validation study of the Italian Nosocomial Infections Surveillance in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) project (SPIN-UTI) surveillance data. The objective was to validate infection data and thus to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of NI data reported on patients in the ICUs participating in the SPIN-UTI network. A validation study was performed at the end of the surveillance period. All medical records including all clinical and laboratory data were reviewed retrospectively by the trained physicians of the validation team and a positive predictive value (PPV), a negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Eight ICUs (16. 3 %) were randomly chosen from all 49 SPIN-UTI ICUs for the validation study. In total, the validation team reviewed 832 patient charts (27. 3 % of the SPIN-UTI patients). The PPV was 83. 5 % and the NPV was 97. 3 %. The overall sensitivity was 82. 3 % and overall specificity was 97. 2 %. Over- and under-reporting of NIs were related to misinterpretation of the case definitions and deviations from the protocol despite previous <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instructions.</b> The results of this study are useful to identify methodological problems within a surveillance system and have been used to plan retraining for surveillance personnel and to design and implement the second phase of the SPIN-UTI project...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{systems are}} really complex and, thus, their design is not {{straightforward}} either. Big {{part of the}} actual design work is done by designing IP (Intellectual Property) components, re-using them and integrating them. This thesis focuses on IP development flow at Nokia Solutions & Networks (NSN). The goal is to identify working habit related issues and their importance, and provide some easily implementable actions to improve the situation. This thesis includes a literature study of the common flow issues and solutions. The issues could be categorized in the following way: inefficient communication, finding correct documents/files, unclear documentation, unclear code, scripting, version control, software tool related problems including computational platforms and IT support. The field of IP design is not studied widely so software development {{was used as a}} reference when applicable. After the most common issues were identified, 7 employees of NSN were interviewed to get more specific information and find out the impact of different issues. The issues with most impact were: IT related issues, unclear documentation, finding correct documents and tool related problems. As a conclusion, action points were suggested to improve the situation with most important issues. Since there were already ongoing actions to improve IT and unclear documentation, the point of focus became finding correct documents and tool related problems. Based on the more specified results from the interviews the following actions were suggested: link library with short descriptions for different kinds of documents and locations (especially for not-design-related documents such as tool instructions and guidelines) and more comprehensive tool <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instructions.</b> Additionally, the need for script training and guidelines came up in most of the interviews, so that is also recommended...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{procedure}} for determining an adequate literacy and learning method among {{students with visual}} impairments consists two components: an initial choice of mode of literacy, to be conducted during the early childhood and continuing evaluation of the literacy and learning method, which is carried out over students who have already been involved in the educational process for a certain period and with whom a mediums for literacy and learning has already been determined. PURPOSE: The purpose of this research is to conduct a re-evaluation of the initial decision regarding the choice of media through which education is conducted among students with visual impairment. DISCUSSION: The speed of reading is substantially below the predicted minimum level both with students who read Braille and with students who read regular print. It should be mentioned that only 3 respondents out of 15 Braille readers were cooperative {{in this part of the}} research, so they obtained results regarding them should not be taken as reliable ones. 100 % of the respondents who are educated using the Braille alphabet independently read unfamiliar formal and also familiar educational material. Among the students who use regular print, 62. 5 % read independently and the other 37. 5 % need additional instruction. 45. 5 % of them successfully completed their school assignments using their initially chosen medium for literacy and learning, but only 18. 2 % of them do it in an acceptable time period. 53. 6 % of respondents know how to use available resources and facilities that exist within the school, while the other 46, 4 % need additional <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instructions.</b> CONCLUSION: Continuous evaluation should be implemented consistently throughout the schooling of the child, or at least once a year, for a relevant "justification" for any change, addition or selection of another sensory channel for learning and literacy of the child, as a result of certain changes in visual functioning of the child or due to changes in the terms of their education...|$|E

The path-goal theory (House, 1971) and a multidimensional model of leadership (Chelladurai, 1990) were used as the theoretical base. A stratified random sample of 234 males and 183 females adolescent school athletes were selected to answer a questionnaire which consists of personal data, Leadership Scale for Sports (Chelladurai & Saleh, 1980), and satisfaction scale towards leadership. The results indicate that <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instruction</b> behaviour, <b>and</b> rewarding behaviour are often exhibited by coaches, and the autocratic behaviour is seldom portrayed. The results of Pearson’s Product Moment Correlation also show that the score of each dimension of the coaches' <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instruction,</b> democratic, social support and rewarding behaviours has positive significant relation to athletes' satisfaction towards the leadership of coaches. Nevertheless, the “stepwise” multiple regression analysis reveal that <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instruction,</b> democratic <b>and</b> social support behaviour of coaches show positive and significant contribution in relationship of athletes' satisfaction towards coaches' leadership. Furthermore, autocratic behaviour is also found to contribute significantly and negatively in relation to athletes' satisfaction towards coaches' leadership.

40|$|Abstract This {{guidance}} {{describes how}} the FDA evaluates patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments used as effectiveness endpoints in clinical trials. It also describes our current thinking on how sponsors can develop and use study results measured by PRO instruments to support claims in approved product labeling (see appendix point 1). It {{does not address the}} use of PRO instruments for purposes beyond evaluation of claims made about a drug or medical product in its labeling. By explicitly addressing the review issues identified in this guidance, sponsors can increase the efficiency of their endpoint discussions with the FDA during the product development process, streamline the FDA's review of PRO endpoint adequacy, and provide optimal information about the patient's perspective of treatment benefit at the time of product approval. A PRO is a measurement of any aspect of a patient's health status that comes directly from the patient (i. e., without the interpretation of the patient's responses by a physician or anyone else). In clinical trials, a PRO instrument can be used to measure the impact of an intervention on one or more aspects of patients' health status, hereafter referred to as PRO concepts, ranging from the purely symptomatic (response of a headache) to more complex concepts (e. g., ability to carry out activities of daily living), to extremely complex concepts such as quality of life, which is widely understood to be a multidomain concept with physical, psychological, and social components. Data generated by a PRO instrument can provide evidence of a treatment benefit from the patient perspective. For this data to be meaningful, however, there should be evidence that the PRO instrument effectively measures the particular concept that is studied. Generally, findings measured by PRO instruments may be used to support claims in approved product labeling if the claims are derived from adequate and well-controlled investigations that use PRO instruments that reliably and validly measure the specific concepts at issue. The glossary defines many of the terms used in this guidance. In particular, the term instrument refers to the actual questions or items contained in a questionnaire or interview schedule along with all the additional information and documentation that supports the use of these items in producing a PRO measure (e. g., interviewer <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instructions,</b> scoring and interpretation manual). The term conceptual framework refers to how items are grouped according to subconcepts or domains (e. g., the item walking without help may be grouped with another item, walking with difficulty, within the domain of ambulation, and ambulation may be further grouped into the concept of physical ability). FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended but not required.

40|$|Accidents in {{the field}} and on the farm require as much {{attention}} as the appalling lack of safety elsewhere in the food chain. For producers, processors and consumers worldwide, safety measures are often too little, too late and for the unorganised too far away. We all need to eat, and we all need to live. Agriculture is what makes us what we are. Why then do we treat agriculture so badly? At one end of the food chain, in the consumer s shopping basket, there are shrill yelps about food safety. They {{are only part of the}} issue and, with all due respect, a small part of the safety equation. All along the food chain, from the plough to the plate, there is scant respect for the safety of those who produce and process food. Their health and safety is vital, and not only for themselves: without a safe production process, without safe producers, there are no safe consumers. Agriculture is not a romance. Among everything else it means to us, it is a rough, tough world of injury, disability, disease and death. It is the third most hazardous sector after mining and construction. About half of the world s 250 million workplace injuries are estimated to occur in agriculture. Each year, worldwide, according to estimates from the International Labour Office (ILO), 170, 000 workers are killed in the agricultural sector. The sector employs half the world s labour force, with about 1. 3 billion workers active in agricultural production. About 10 per cent (17, 000) of these deaths take place in sub-Saharan Africa. The agricultural labour force in ACP States and other developing countries is known for its high levels of self-employment, although overall half is in some form of waged employment. Self-employed or not, no worker deliberately injures himself or herself, although many people will take highly dangerous shortcuts in their work, under pressure to produce and earn marginal incomes. But danger there is, partly rooted in a lack of safety awareness and education, partly in incomplete <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>instructions,</b> and in part in the age-old predominance of gain over sane. Danger! Farmers at work The high levels of fatalities and injuries in agriculture twice as high as most other sectors are due to its special conditions. Much agricultural work involves multiple tasks and multiple locations, most of them in the open air, exposing workers to climatic conditions. Much work is seasonal, with added urgency. Workers are in frequent or constant contact with animals and plants, and are exposed to bites, poisoning, infections, parasitic diseases, allergies and toxicity. The postures required in many agricultural tasks, coupled with ill-designed manual tools or mechanical equipment, lead to injury and disabilities. The levels of exposure to pesticides and other chemicals are renowned many small-scale farmers are unaware of the dangers of pesticides and have no practical access to either clear instructions or protective clothing. The safety position on formal, large-scale farms is often no better. The ILO reports many cases in Zimbabwe and Ethiopia where neither training nor protection is available to most workers, at least not to casual or temporary workers. Away from the field, the lack of safety is equally alarming. Small, ill-lit, ill-ventilated workplaces with poorly-protected equipment are often the icons of agro-processing plants, at least in the informal sector. The risks for the safety of workers, and the hygiene of the end-product, are serious. Read the rule-book As production intensifies, the techniques for crop cultivation and livestock rearing, food processing and distribution become more complex. The introduction of more machinery and numerous chemical compounds, from fertilisers to cleaning agents, each bring potentially harmful human and environmental effects in their wake. And yet the sector, and those agencies and legislative bodies which provide its enabling environment, are failing to accompany these changes with appropriate information, training and, to be blunt, safety legislation. There are already about twenty conventions on occupational safety and health (OSH) which have been adopted by the governments, employers and workers organisations which comprise the ILO. Countries such as Sweden and Finland have ratified 85 % or more; most ACP States between four and none. Even where laws can be realistically applied, agriculture is often omitted from OSH legislation of many countries. In Kenya and Brazil, for example, labour laws apply to agriculture as well as to other industries but the laws of Ghana, Sierra Leone, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo exclude agricultural workers completely or partially. The legislation of yet other countries has a wider scope: in Fiji, Namibia and South Africa, employers are required to safeguard the safety and health of people other than employees who might be affected by the work of the enterprise. It is the casual labourer and self-employed farmer who are least likely to be protected. In Ethiopia it is estimated that 80 per cent of national economic activity falls outside the Labour Code, consisting of small-scale and subsistence farming. Women often fall into these categories, working on self-employed smallholdings and as seasonal labourers. In all, more than 700 million agricultural workers worldwide, and more than 130 million in ACP countries, fall outside the theoretical or real protection of OSH legislation. Where there is no enforcer The well-known saying Safety begins at home applies in agriculture as much as in any other sector. The unacceptable numbers of occupational fatalities and injuries in agriculture could clearly be substantially reduced by a more general safety -mindedness among workers. This is a question of on-the-job training, to be sure, but also of general education. One by one, the measures are easy enough to list. How about encouraging blacksmiths to add covers to chopping machines, or involving women in designing lighter hand tools which cause less muscle strain? It is at the grassroots level that safety will take hold, but it is at other levels that it will be made possible. At a seminar on Safety and Health organised in Bamako, Mali, by the ILO, the International Union of Food workers (IUF) and the CTA in December 2000, participants called for action across the political and legislative stage, as well as by civil society and development bodies (more about this in Spore 92). Safety in agriculture is, though, virgin territory in terms of development policies; it has, quite simply, been neglected by many bodies of national and global governance for decades. That could be about to change, with a Safety and Health in Agriculture Convention being presented for adoption to the general conference of the ILO in June 2001. It is ambitious, it is overdue and, praised be its designers, it is inclusive. It insists that the specific needs of self-employed farmers, women, seasonal workers and young workers be addressed, and that they enjoy protection equivalent to that provided to other workers in agriculture. It does not, however, cover subsistence farming, forestry or agro-processing, the latter being covered in principle by industrial conventions. For those accustomed to working in the formal sector, whether government inspectors or trade union organisers, this convention will challenge attitudes and ways of work. The task of getting it adopted is in itself a massive challenge, as the participants to the Bamako seminar affirmed. The harder, and even more necessary, task is to find ways and means to implement it. We all need to eat, and we all need to be safe. [summary points] Among measures needed to promote occupational safety and health in agriculture: - school curriculum development and media campaigns on safety awareness - re-training of extension workers, agricultural engineers, government inspectorates and trade unions - incentives (credit, awards, prizes) for safe tools and equipment - promotion of safe use, storage and disposal of chemicals at all stages of agricultural production - strengthening enforcement capacity of national safety bodies - inclusion of national safety bodies in agricultural policy formulation and implementation - overall legislative framework, adoption of ILO Convention See 'Links' for access to Safety and Health informationAccidents {{in the field}} and on the farm require as much attention as the appalling lack of safety elsewhere in the food chain.
