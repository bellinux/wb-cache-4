5|$|A {{year after}} González Dávila's {{discovery}} of the Gulf of Fonesca, various Spanish expeditions set out to conquer the territory of Honduras. These expeditions were launched southwards from Mexico and Guatemala, and northwards from Panama and Nicaragua; their rival captains clashed in Honduras, resulting in attempts at conquest of the natives being punctuated by battles between competing Spanish forces, and infighting within individual Spanish groups. The various Spanish groups also fielded indigenous auxiliaries <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> efforts.|$|E
5|$|Although practised in Basse Casamance for centuries, rice {{cultivation}} has been threatened {{since the late}} 1960s. Productivity has declined because many workers have opted for life in the city, even though they continue <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> community. The drought of the 1970s and 1980s further aggravated the situation.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are 40,000 to 70,000 living in Nepal. Sometimes called untouchables among the untouchables, they have for decades been doomed <b>to</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>their</b> impoverished families through prostitution.|$|R

5|$|Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie uses several {{different}} types of electricity pylons <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> 735kV power lines. All of them are single-circuit, meaning that each pylon carries one power line with three bundles of four electrical subconductors separated by spacers, with each bundle transmitting one phase of current.|$|E
5|$|Initially, sauropods {{were thought}} to be mainly aquatic, inhabiting lush peat swamps and being captive to the {{buoyancy}} of water <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> giant body weights. In 1984, Cooper pointed out that Vulcanodon, the most primitive sauropod known at that time, lived in a desert like environment and therefore must have been terrestrial. This indicated that the large body size of sauropods, as already seen in Vulcanodon, had not evolved as an adaptation to an aquatic life style.|$|E
5|$|John of Ibelin, who was {{the leader}} of Emperor Frederick's opponents in the kingdoms of Jerusalem and Cyprus, tried to {{convince}} Bohemond <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> cause. John sent his son, Balian, to Tripoli to negotiate with Bohemond, but the elderly Bohemond remained neutral in the conflict. Bohemond died in March 1233, {{a few weeks before the}} pope's confirmation of his treaty with the Hospitallers came to Tripoli. He was regarded as a great jurist by his contemporaries.|$|E
50|$|The National Weather Service {{does not}} fund {{the program in}} forms other than review and recognition.

It does, however, issue a sign that communities may display.|$|R

5|$|Many {{migrant workers}} have little education, little {{knowledge}} {{of the law and}} their rights, and leave home <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> families. They fall victim to agents (official and unofficial), unscrupulous officials and a lack of legal protection at home and in their host countries. The debts they incur to secure employment overseas may lock them in a cycle of abuse and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Men with {{wives and}} dependents found it {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> families. Beyond a small allowance, the men did not get paid for their service, nor were their dependents given an allowance. To be closer to their husbands, women sought employment near their husband's assignment. Later, when jobs on dairy farms became available, families could live together in housing provided for farm workers.|$|E
5|$|Rheinland {{covered a}} sweep by torpedo boats into the North Sea on 25–26 September. She then {{participated in a}} fleet advance on 18–20 October. In early 1917, the ship was {{stationed}} on sentry duty in the German Bight. The crew became unruly due to poor quality food in July and August of that year. The ship did not take part directly in Operation Albion against the Russians, but remained in the western Baltic to prevent a possible incursion by the British <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> Russian ally.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, {{the cloud}} {{collapsed}} as the gases expanded and lost their capability <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum but not Pompeii. Additional blasts reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Plinian and Peléan six times. Surges 3 and 4 are believed {{by the authors}} to have buried Pompeii. Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.|$|E
5|$|The German {{occupation}} of Luxembourg in World War I {{was the first}} of two military occupations of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg by Germany in the twentieth century. From August 1914 until the end of World War I on 11 November 1918, Luxembourg was under full occupation by the German Empire. The German government justified the occupation by citing the need <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> armies in neighbouring France, although many Luxembourgers, contemporary and present, have interpreted German actions otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The Usumacinta style {{developed}} in the hilly terrain of the Usumacinta drainage. Cities {{took advantage of the}} hillsides <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> major architecture, as at Palenque and Yaxchilan. Sites modified corbel vaulting to allow thinner walls and multiple access doors to temples. As in Petén, roof combs adorned principal structures. Palaces had multiple entrances that used post-and-lintel entrances rather than corbel vaulting. Many sites erected stelae, but Palenque instead developed finely sculpted panelling to decorate its buildings.|$|E

5|$|The book {{presents}} an in-depth analysis and refutation {{of climate change}} denial, going over several arguments point-by-point and disproving them with peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus for climate change. The authors assert that those denying climate change engage in tactics including cherry picking data purported <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> specific viewpoints, and attacking the integrity of climate scientists. They use social science theory to examine the phenomenon of climate change denial in the wider public, and call this phenomenon a form of pathology.|$|E
5|$|The defense, <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> {{theory that}} Conley murdered Phagan in a robbery, focused on Phagan's missing purse. Conley claimed {{in court that}} he saw Frank place the purse in his office safe, {{although}} he denied having seen the purse before the trial. Another witness testified that, on the Monday after the murder, the safe was open {{and there was no}} purse in it. The significance of Phagan's torn pay envelope was disputed by both sides.|$|E

5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, {{but they have}} a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.|$|E
5|$|Bears are {{generally}} bulky and robust animals with short tails. They are sexually dimorphic {{with regard to}} size, with males typically being larger. Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species. Relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> bulk. The shoulder blades and the pelvis are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter {{than those of the}} big cats as {{there is no need for}} them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig out burrowing animals, to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.|$|E
5|$|By the 1830s the British Agricultural Revolution had {{disturbed}} traditional {{society and}} created a class of labourers who struggled <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>their</b> families in rural areas. This led to an unrest known as the Swing riots which swept across southern England, consequently reaching Selborne and Liphook in September 1830. The Parliamentary Enclosure Acts of 1856 established a new land pattern for nearby Steep Marsh and Stroud, which still exists today. There was also extensive land drainage between 1860 and 1880; conduits and sluices were constructed to take water from Ashford Stream for the artificial flooding of hay meadows. In Steep, hops were grown for use in local breweries, watercress produced for commercial use, and a condensed milk factory was in operation in Steep Marsh.|$|E
