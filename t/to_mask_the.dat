5|$|Although {{psilocybin}} may {{be prepared}} synthetically, {{outside of the}} research setting, it is not typically used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a herbal tea, or by combining with other foods <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>the</b> bitter taste. In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously.|$|E
5|$|Machinima {{productions}} {{can remain}} {{close to their}} gaming roots and feature stunts or other portrayals of gameplay. Popular genres include dance videos, comedy, and drama. Alternatively, some filmmakers attempt to stretch {{the boundaries of the}} rendering engines or <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>the</b> original 3-D context. The Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences (AMAS), a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting machinima, recognizes exemplary productions through Mackie awards given at its annual Machinima Film Festival. Some general film festivals accept machinima, and game companies, such as Epic Games, Blizzard Entertainment and Jagex, have sponsored contests involving it.|$|E

5|$|The {{background}} of the final scene, which shows a Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior airplane with personnel walking around it, was staged using little person extras and a proportionate cardboard plane. Fog was used <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>the</b> model's unconvincing appearance. Nevertheless, the Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park in Orlando, Florida purchased a Lockheed 12A for its Great Movie Ride attraction, and initially claimed {{that it was the}} actual plane used in the film.|$|E
5|$|For {{the letter}} experiment, they asked 219 Japanese {{undergraduate}} students to rate {{each of the}} 45 hiragana, part of the Japanese writing system, according to how much they liked it. For the number experiment, they asked 269 Japanese undergraduate students to rate the numbers between 0 and 49 on attractiveness. The number 49 {{was chosen as the}} upper limit <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>the</b> true aim of the study, which 31 (being the maximum number of days in a month) might have hinted at. Likewise, the number 0 was included for disguise. Participants had to give ratings on a six-point scale, ranging from 1 if they disliked the number very much, to 6 if they liked it very much. Once done, participants were asked for various demographic data, including their birthday.|$|E
5|$|In Greco-Roman times saffron {{was widely}} traded across the Mediterranean by the Phoenicians. Their {{customers}} {{ranged from the}} perfumers of Rosetta, in Egypt, to physicians in Gaza to townsfolk in Rhodes, who wore pouches of saffron in order <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>the</b> presence of malodorous fellow citizens during outings to the theatre. For the Greeks, saffron was widely associated with professional courtesans and retainers known as the hetaerae. Large dye works operating in Sidon and Tyre used saffron baths as a substitute; there, royal robes were triple-dipped in deep purple dyes; for the robes of royal pretenders and commoners, the last two dips were replaced with a saffron dip, which gave a less intense purple hue.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{standard}} method for applying the task. The {{most commonly used}} one is a rating task, which involves having participants judge all the numbers under a certain threshold (typically over 31 <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>the</b> purpose of assessing connections to dates), indicating how much they like them on a 7-point rating scale. There is no standard algorithm for calculating implicit self-esteem. At least six algorithms are in use. In their meta-analysis of the name-letter effect, Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend using the ipsatized double-correction algorithm. The algorithms are typically applied to both {{the number of the}} day and of the month.|$|E
5|$|Part of Guderian's {{original}} plan {{had called for}} a feint south towards and behind the Maginot Line, <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>the</b> intention to thrust to the channel. General Franz Halder had dropped this from Fall Gelb, but Guderian resurrected it and ordered the 10th Panzer Division and Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment to attack across the Stonne plateau. In this innocuous town, a vicious two-day battle took place in which the Germans {{came face to face}} with the premier French tank, the Char B1-Bis, for the only time. One of these tanks, commanded by Pierre Billotte, proved invulnerable to German anti-tank fire and took 140 hits, and knocked out 13 German tanks (two PzKpfw IV and eleven PzKpfw III) and a number of anti-tank guns. It transpired that the French had concentrated their own armour there to mount another attack on the Sedan bridgeheads. The battle of Stonne took place between 15 and 17 May, and the town changed hands 17 times. Ultimately the failure of the French to hold it meant the final failure to eliminate the Sedan bridgeheads.|$|E

25|$|To {{interrupt}} a read burst by a {{write command}} is possible, but more difficult. It can be done, if the DQM signal {{is used to}} suppress output from the SDRAM so that the memory controller may drive data over the DQ lines to the SDRAM {{in time for the}} write operation. Because the effects of DQM on read data are delayed by 2 cycles, but the effects of DQM on write data are immediate, DQM must be raised (<b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>the</b> read data) beginning at least two cycles before write command, but must be lowered for the cycle of the write command (assuming the write command is intended to have an effect).|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} ways to prevent electromagnetic attacks is to make it difficult for an attacker to collect an electromagnetic signal at the physical level. Broadly, the hardware designer could design the encryption hardware to reduce signal strength or to protect the chip. Circuit and wire shielding, such as a Faraday cage, are effective in reducing the signal, as well as filtering the signal or introducing extraneous noise <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>the</b> signal. Additionally, most electromagnetic attacks require attacking equipment to be very close to the target, so distance is an effective countermeasure. Circuit designers can also use certain glues or design components {{in order to make it}} difficult or impossible to depackage the chip without destroying it.|$|E
25|$|On 10 April 1809, the Austrian VIII Armeekorps {{advanced}} from Tarvisio {{while the}} IX Armeekorps crossed the Isonzo River near Cividale. By the 12th they joined near Udine and {{pushed to the}} west. Eugène was compelled to detach Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers and one Italian division to watch the Tyrol. As the Austrians moved west, they detached forces <b>to</b> <b>mask</b> <b>the</b> Franco-Italian fortresses of Palmanova and Osoppo. Believing that he could defeat Archduke John, Eugène ordered his divisions to concentrate at Sacile. By 14 April, he collected the five infantry divisions of Jean Mathieu Seras, Jean-Baptiste Broussier, Paul Grenier, Gabriel Barbou des Courières, and Philippe Eustache Louis Severoli, and the light cavalry division of Louis Michel Antoine Sahuc. Eugène's divisions were not organized into corps, making his army more difficult to control in battle.|$|E
