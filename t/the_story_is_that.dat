25|$|Withering {{was born}} in Wellington, Shropshire, {{the son of a}} surgeon. He trained as a {{physician}} and studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. He worked at Birmingham General Hospital from 1779. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he noticed a person with dropsy (swelling from congestive heart failure) improve remarkably after taking a traditional herbal remedy; Withering became famous for recognising that the active ingredient in the mixture came from the foxglove plant. The active ingredient is now known as digitalis, after the plant's scientific name. In 1785, Withering published An Account of the Foxglove and some of its Medical Uses, which contained reports on clinical trials and notes on digitalis's effects and toxicity.|$|E
25|$|According to the myth, Zeus {{gave the}} infant Dionysus {{to the care}} of Hermes.

Hermes bade the couple to raise the boy as a girl, to hide him from Hera's wrath. Another version is that Dionysus was taken to the rain-nymphs of Nysa, who nourished his infancy and childhood, and for their care Zeus rewarded them by placing them as the Hyades among the stars (see Hyades star cluster). Other {{versions}} have Zeus giving him to Rhea, or to Persephone to raise in the Underworld, away from Hera. Alternatively, he was raised by Maro.|$|E
25|$|Carcetti {{watches a}} news {{report about the}} exhumed bodies and {{discusses}} the political implications with his staff. Norman Wilson remarks that the bodies are attributable to the Royce administration and Michael Steintorf, the new chief of staff, states that the silver lining of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it draws {{attention away from the}} massive school deficit. Steintorf counsels that they should use this as cover to avoid dealing with the deficit as it would hamstring Carcetti's plans to run for governor and that Carcetti will have the funds to address the city's education problems when he becomes governor. Wilson is disappointed to see that Carcetti is willing to trade fulfilling his responsibilities as mayor with increasing his chances of becoming governor.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} alleged that Nuvolari was {{involved}} in a race-fixing scandal at the Tripoli Grand Prix. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he conspired with Achille Varzi and Baconin Borzacchini to fix the race in order to profit from the Libyan state lottery, in which 30 tickets were drawn before the race—one for each starter—and the holder of the ticket corresponding to the victorious driver won 7.5 million lire. Others say the allegation was unfounded and that it originated with Alfred Neubauer, the Mercedes-Benz team manager at the time, who was well known as a raconteur with a penchant for spicing up a story. Neubauer's version does not altogether hold true with documented records of events, which indicate that Nuvolari, Varzi, and Borzacchini agreed to pool the prize money should one of them win.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} this version of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the 18-pounders were on the lower deck, so {{it would take a}} very lucky drop to reach them from high above. Captain Pearson speculated that either a grenade had been thrown {{through a hole in the}} hull, from Bonhomme Richard’s gun deck, or that the charge had been ignited by accident. Whatever the cause, the effect was devastating. As the ignited charge blew up, it {{scattered}} burning gunpowder, setting off other charges nearby, and ultimately the chain reaction covered the entire rear half of Serapis’ lower gun-deck, killing or severely burning many of the gunnery crewmen, forcing some to leap into the sea to extinguish their burning clothes, and putting five guns out of action. In the confusion, some of the crew clambering back on board after jumping into the sea were nearly mistaken for American boarders.|$|E

Upon hearing this he {{resolved}} to leave Corinth and never return. While traveling he came to the very crossroads where Laius was killed, and encountered a carriage which attempted to drive him off the road. An argument ensued and Oedipus killed the travelers, including a man who matches Jocasta's description of Laius. Oedipus has hope, however, because <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Laius was murdered by several robbers. If the shepherd confirms that Laius was attacked by many men, then Oedipus is in the clear.|$|E

25|$|After King Drupada and King Virata were slain by Drona, Bhima and Dhrishtadyumna fought him on {{the fifteenth}} day. Because Drona was very {{powerful}} and inconquerable having the irresistible Brahmanda astra, Krishna hinted to Yudhishthira that Drona would give up his arms if his son Ashwatthama was dead. Bhima proceeded to kill an elephant named Ashwatthama and loudly proclaimed that Ashwatthama was dead. Drona approached Yudhishthira to seek the truth of his son's death. Yudhishthira proclaimed Ashwathama Hatahath, Naro Va Kunjaro Va, implying Ashwathama had died but he was nor sure {{whether it was a}} Drona's son or an elephant, The latter part of his proclamation (Naro va Kunjaro va) were drowned out by sound of the conch blown by Krishna intentionally (a different version of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Yudhishthira pronounced the last words so feebly that Drona could not hear the word elephant). Prior to this incident, the chariot of Yudhishthira, proclaimed as Dharma raja (King of righteousness), hovered a few inches off the ground.

25|$|The {{history of}} mining at Philmont {{dates back to}} the years {{immediately}} after the Civil War. U.S. soldiers were stationed in the West after the war, as the U.S. Army was driving out the American Indians. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one of these soldiers befriended an Indian, who happened to give him a shiny rock. The shiny material in the rock was found to be copper. According to the story, the soldier and two of his friends went up to investigate, and found gold. They could not stay to mine the gold and the area was overrun by miners by the time they returned the next year. Scores of gold mines were excavated in Philmont, and operated into the early 20th century. A large vein of gold is said to lie under Mount Baldy to this day, but extracting it has not been feasible. It is a common joke at Philmont that some day the mines under Baldy will collapse and Phillips will be the highest mountain in Philmont. The Contention Mine, located at Cyphers Mine, and the Aztec Mine, located at French Henry, are open to guided tours.|$|E

When creating this chapel the monks of Peterborough had thought of how they had acquired it and built into the chapel a narrow tower - just big enough for a monk to climb to the top by an internal stair and stand guard over Oswald's Arm 24 hours a day, every day of the year.
