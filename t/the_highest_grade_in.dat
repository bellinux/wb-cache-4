25|$|In 2005, {{the oral}} {{component}} of the Syllabus B English language examination was incorrectly added to the total score because of a recent upgrade to the HKEAA computer system, and the supervisor in charge failed to double-check the results. Subsequently, many candidates received an incorrect total score, which resulted in an incorrect final grade for the subject. The problem was so severe that some students wrongfully received an F grade (the second-lowest grade) when {{they were supposed to}} receive an A (<b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>grade)</b> <b>in</b> the oral section. Since the final English mark is calculated by averaging the marks in the oral, reading comprehension, listening, and writing sections, having an F in oral would have seriously affected the final English mark if the candidate did well in other components.|$|E

2500|$|By this point, Li Kui {{also had}} the {{additional}} office of deputy minister of rites (禮部侍郎, Libu Shilang). [...] He was displeased with how the officials {{in charge of the}} imperial examinations at the time were making their testing questions test highly obscure facts, and he believed that this led to the selection of examinees who were not necessarily talented or capable in writing. [...] He therefore, at the examinations, made the Confucian classics, histories, and qieyun references available to the examinees for them to look through the books during examination. [...] He was much praised for this reform. [...] It was also said that Li Kui was handsome in appearance and capable in rhetoric.

6000|$|The {{very vital}} {{importance}} of the word [...] "Master" [...] is this. A Guild was, very broadly speaking, a Trade Union in which every man was his own employer. That is, a man could not work at any trade unless he would join the league and accept the laws of that trade; but he worked in his own shop with his own tools, and the whole profit went to himself. But the word [...] "employer" [...] marks a modern deficiency which makes the modern {{use of the word}} [...] "master" [...] quite inexact. A master meant something quite other and greater than a [...] "boss." [...] It meant a master of the work, where it now means only a master of the workmen. It is an elementary character of Capitalism that a shipowner need not know the right end of a ship, or a landowner have even seen the landscape, that the owner of a goldmine may be interested in nothing but old pewter, or the owner of a railway travel exclusively in balloons. He may be a more successful capitalist if he has a hobby of his own business; he is often a more successful capitalist if he has the sense to leave it to a manager; but economically he can control the business because he is a capitalist, not because he has any kind of hobby or any kind of sense. <b>The</b> <b>highest</b> <b>grade</b> <b>in</b> the Guild system was a Master, and it meant a mastery of the business. To take the term created by the colleges in the same epoch, all the mediæval bosses were Masters of Arts. The other grades were the journeyman and the apprentice; but like the corresponding degrees at the universities, they were grades through which every common man could pass. They were not social classes; they were degrees and not castes. This is {{the whole point of the}} recurrent romance about the apprentice marrying his master's daughter. The master would not be surprised at such a thing, any more than an M.A. would swell with aristocratic indignation when his daughter married a B.A.|$|E
