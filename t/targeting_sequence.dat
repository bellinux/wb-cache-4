5|$|Gunfights {{are a major}} {{gameplay}} mechanic in Red Dead Redemption. The {{player can}} take cover, target a specific person or animal, blindfire, and free aim. Individual body parts can also be targeted, {{in order to take}} targets down non-lethally. When the player shoots an enemy, the game engine uniquely creates the AI reactions and movements depending on where they were hit. The player character can choose from period-accurate weapons including revolvers, pistols, lever or bolt-action rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, knives, explosives, lassos, mounted Gatling guns, and cannons. Duels utilize a gunslinger gameplay mechanic known as Dead Eye. Dead Eye is a targeting system that is used in a bullet time-like manner, allowing the player to slow down time to place a precise shot or paint in multiple shots. When the <b>targeting</b> <b>sequence</b> ends, Marston automatically fires to all marked locations in extremely quick succession.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{confusion}} in the primary sources over what was the target in Dresden, {{whether it was the}} marshalling yards near the centre or centre of the built up area. The report by the 1st Bombardment Division's commander to his commander states that the <b>targeting</b> <b>sequence</b> was the centre of the built up area in Dresden if the weather was clear. If clouds obscured Dresden but Chemnitz was clear, Chemnitz was the target. If both were obscured, they would bomb the centre of Dresden using H2X radar. The mix of bombs for the Dresden raid was about 40% incendiaries—much closer to the RAF city busting mix than that the USAAF usually used in precision bombardment. Taylor compares this 40% mix with the raid on Berlin on 3 February, where the ratio was 10% incendiaries. This was a common mix when the USAAF anticipated cloudy conditions over the target.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the role of {{reinforced}} behavioral variability in the learning of a 6 -digit <b>target</b> <b>sequence</b> (211212) with 3 groups of human participants (n = 39). For the first group (Control), only the <b>target</b> <b>sequence</b> was reinforced. For the second group (Any), the <b>target</b> <b>sequence</b> was reinforced, and any sequence other than the <b>target</b> <b>sequence</b> could be reinforced on a variable interval 60 -s schedule. For the third group (Variable), the <b>target</b> <b>sequence</b> was reinforced, and any sequence other than the <b>target</b> <b>sequence</b> could be reinforced on a variable interval 60 -s schedule, if it met a variability criterion. The Control group produced the <b>target</b> <b>sequence</b> significantly more often than the Variable group {{by the end of}} the experimental sessions. These findings contradict previous studies with rats that have shown that reinforcement of behavioral variability facilitates the learning of difficult response sequences but are consistent with results from previous studies with humans.

40|$|Four rats were {{required}} to press either a right or left lever to complete various three-response sequences. After extended exposure to a training sequence, subjects were shifted to a new <b>target</b> <b>sequence.</b> The new <b>target</b> <b>sequences</b> always differed from the previous sequence by the response required in the first or last position of the sequence. Subjects were repeatedly exposed to all possible combinations of training and new <b>target</b> <b>sequences.</b> Learning of new sequences occurred more rapidly when {{the change in the}} new <b>target</b> <b>sequence</b> was in the last position. Errors persisted longer in new sequences in which the change was in the first position. Extinction of the training sequence occurred iaster when the change was in the last position. Responses in the last position were considerably more sensitive to the shift to new <b>target</b> <b>sequences</b> than were responses in the first position. Even though response sequences may form new behavioral units from the training sequence, reinforcement and extinction acted differentially on the individual lever presses within new <b>target</b> <b>sequences</b> rather than on the sequences as a whole. These findings support the hypothesis that response strength is determined by contiguity to reinforcement...|$|R
40|$|Objective　To {{construct}} the recombinant Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) carrying brain-specific miRNA <b>targeting</b> <b>sequences.</b> Methods　The <b>target</b> <b>sequences</b> of brain-specific miR- 124 and miR- 125 were {{introduced into the}} infectious cDNA clone of JEV to generate recombinant plasmids based on reverse genetics technology. The recombinant plasmids were linearized with Xho Ⅰ and served as templates of transcription with SP 6 RNA polymerase to generate infectious viral RNA. The RNA transcripts were then transfected into BHK- 21 cells, and the supernatant was obtained after incubated at 37 ℃, 5 % CO 2 for 3 days. The cytopathic changes of BHK- 21 cells inoculated with the supernatant were observed after one passage. The rescued viruses carrying miRNA <b>target</b> <b>sequences</b> were validated by RT-PCR, standard plaque forming test on BHK- 21 cells and growth curves analysis. Results　Two recombinant viruses carrying miR- 124 or miR- 125 <b>target</b> <b>sequence</b> were rescued, respectively. The insertion of miRNA <b>target</b> <b>sequences</b> was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The rescued viruses yielded similar plaque morphology and replication efficiency compared with wild type JEV. Conclusion　The recombinant JEV containing brain-specific miRNA <b>target</b> <b>sequences</b> {{can be obtained by}} reverse genetics technique, which could be used in further studies of miRNA-mediated tissue-specific attenuation mechanism of JEV.

40|$|The known {{nucleoside}} triphosphate-dependent restriction enzymes are hetero-oligomeric {{proteins that}} behave as molecular machines {{in response to}} their <b>target</b> <b>sequences.</b> They translocate DNA in a process dependent on the hydrolysis of a nucleoside triphosphate. For the ATP-dependent type I and type III restriction and modification systems, the collision of translocating complexes triggers hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds in unmodified DNA to generate double-strand breaks. Type I endonucleases break the DNA at unspecified sequences remote from the <b>target</b> <b>sequence,</b> type III endonucleases at a fixed position close to the <b>target</b> <b>sequence.</b> Type I and type III restriction and modification (R-M) systems are notable for effective post-translational control of their endonuclease activity. For some type I enzymes, this control is mediated by proteolytic degradation of that subunit of the complex which is essential for DNA translocation and breakage. This control, lacking in the well-studied type II R-M systems, provides extraordinarily effective protection of resident DNA should it acquire unmodified <b>target</b> <b>sequences.</b> The only well-documented GTP-dependent restriction enzyme, McrBC, requires methylated <b>target</b> <b>sequences</b> for the initiation of phosphodiester bond cleavage...|$|R

50|$|In a <b>targeted</b> approach, <b>sequencing</b> of ctDNA can be {{directed}} towards a genetic panel constructed based on mutational hotspots for the cancer of interest.

These oligonucleotides hybridize with <b>target</b> nucleic acid <b>sequences</b> with greater affinity than antisense oligonucleotides, which hybridize to the <b>target</b> <b>sequence</b> only by Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding [Kandimalla, E. R. and Agrawal, S. Gene(1994) 149, 115 - 121 and references cited therein]. FTFOs have been studied for their ability to destabilize quadruplexes formation by RNA or DNA <b>target</b> <b>sequences.</b> The influence of various DNA/RNA compositions of FTFOs on their ability to destabilize RNA and DNA quadruplexes has been examined. The ability of the FTFOs to destabilize quadruplex structures is related to the structurally and thermodynamically stable foldback triplex formed between the FTFO and its <b>target</b> <b>sequence.</b> Antisense oligonucleotides (DNA or RNA) that can form only a Watson-Crick double helix with the <b>target</b> <b>sequence</b> are unable to destabilize quadruplex structures of RNA and DNA <b>target</b> <b>sequences</b> and are therefore limited in their repertoire of <b>target</b> <b>sequences.</b> The quadruplex destabilization ability of FTFOs is dependent {{on the nature of the}} cation present in solution. The RNA quadruplex destabilization ability of FTFOs is - 20 % higher in the presence of sodium ion than potassium ion. The use of FTFOs, which can destabilize quadruplex structure, opens up new areas for development of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics, specifically, <b>targeting</b> guanine-rich <b>sequences</b> that exist at the ends of pro- and eukaryotic chromosomes and dimerization regions of retroviral RNA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A novel {{molecular}} {{method for}} HIV- 1 proviral DNA detection comprising two main techniques: nested PCR, amplifying a <b>target</b> <b>sequence</b> of the ENV-gene of HIV- 1, and non-radioactively-reversed probe hybridization {{for the detection}} of the amplified <b>target</b> <b>sequence.</b> The dual amplification of inserted HIV- 1 proviral DNA in each DNA sample to be tested was performed by nested PCR in two steps: firstly with two outer primers covering the <b>target</b> <b>sequence</b> of the ENV-gene of HIV- 1; secondly with two 5 ′-biotinylated primers specific to the <b>target</b> <b>sequence.</b> The biotinylated PCR product could be visualized as a single band of 141 bps in length on agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. For the confirmation of the primary result, a method of reversed probe hybridization, using a nylon membrane immobilized with the oligo-nucleotide probe specific to the <b>target</b> <b>sequence,</b> was established. The oligonucleotide probe was given a homopolymer tail with terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl-transferase; the tail was spotted onto a nylon membrane and bound covalently by UV irradiation. Owing to its length, the tail bound to the nylon, leaving the oligonucleotide probe free to hybridize. Hybridization of the amplified <b>target</b> <b>sequence</b> to the immobilized probe was accomplished by a simple colorimetric reaction involving the enzymatic oxidation of a colorless chromogen that yielded a purple color wherever hybridization occurred...|$|R
