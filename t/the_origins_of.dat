5|$|<b>The</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> endomembrane {{system is}} linked to <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> eukaryotes {{themselves}} and <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> eukaryoties to <b>the</b> endosymbiotic <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> mitochondria. Many models have been put forward to explain <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> endomembrane system (reviewed in).

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, we {{measured}} the morphometric and histological {{changes in the}} cyprinid loach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, during the early period of growth. Eyes, yolk length, yolk height, and yolk volume of the larva decreased for 16 days post hatching (DPH) (P 0. 05), the most anterior extension of the head × the posterior end of the supraoccipital, the most anterior extension of the head × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal fin, the most anterior extension of the head × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pectoral fin, the posterior end of the supraoccipital × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelvic fin, and <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal fin × <b>the</b> ventral <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> caudal fin gradually decreased, whereas the most anterior extension of the head × <b>the</b> dorsal <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> caudal fin, <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal fin × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anal fin, <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal fin × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pectoral fin, and the insertion of the dorsal fin × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelvic fin gradually increased (P< 0. 05). In the cyprinid loach, the retina is composed of six layers: the epithelial layer, ganglion cell layer, inner nuclear layer, inner plexiform layer, outer limiting membrane, and rod and cone layer (RCL). After hatching, part of the RCL gradually increased in density. The kidney and midgut epithelium were already formed in the cyprinid loach just after hatching and grew gradually in subsequent days...|$|R
