5000|$|Plastics such as acetate, vinyl, and PET film allow {{a variety}} of features, such as greater strength, stiffness, {{transparency}} and resistance to tearing. They typically require special equipment and printing methods (ultra-violet curing is common) as they do not normally print well with conventional ink. A bumper sticker is usually a vinyl label with a very strong, durable adhesive and lightfast inks. Embossing tape is [...] "printed" [...] by pressing raised elements similar to printing type onto it, which produces raised glyphs that look white due to discoloration of the plastic. A type known as 'destructible vinyl' is commonly used for asset labels. It combines a very thin frangible face stock with a very strong high <b>tack</b> <b>adhesive,</b> thus making the label impossible to remove without damaging it. Engraved multi-layer Traffolyte labels are frequently used in industrial situations due to their durability; ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The blended film of deproteinized {{natural rubber}} latex (DNRL) with hydroxypropyl {{methylcellulose}} (HPMC) and dibutylphthalate (DBP) provided good properties that suitable for pharmaceutical applications. However, this film had successfully been confirmed in transdermal use only for high skin permeable drugs. In this study, this film was further modified {{to look forward}} on the delivery of a low permeable drug. Glycols, one group of chemical penetration enhancer, were investigated to blend in this film {{in order to enhance}} the low permeable drug through the skin. Various concentrations (5, 10, 15, and 20 parts per hundred of rubber (phr)) of ethylene glycol (EG), propylene glycol (PG), and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) were blended with DNRL/HPMC/ DBP mixtures before film construction by solution-casting technique. The modified films were evaluated in thickness, tensile strength, peel strength, <b>tack</b> <b>adhesive,</b> swelling and erosion ratios, moisture uptake, and compatibility. These blended films provided good characters in elasticity, adhesive properties, hydrophilicity, and compatibility. Their thickness could be controlled to be uniform. These new blended films were suitable to use in the further study for low permeable drug delivery through the skin...|$|E
40|$|Methods are {{provided}} for altering the <b>tack</b> of an <b>adhesive</b> material by contacting the adhesive material with {{an amount of}} a cyclodextrin compound effective to reduce the <b>tack</b> of the <b>adhesive</b> material. In a preferred embodiment, the method is for altering the <b>tack</b> of <b>adhesive</b> contaminants in a process fluid, which includes the steps of providing a process fluid in which are dispersed contaminant particles which comprises one or more adhesive materials (such as pitch, pressure sensitive adhesives, hot melts, latexes, binders, and combinations thereof); and adding to the process an amount of a cyclodextrin compound effective to reduce the <b>tack</b> of the <b>adhesive</b> material. The process fluid can be in a process stream in a pulp and paper mill. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R

50|$|Wallpaper pastes have {{a typical}} shear {{thinning}} viscosity {{and a high}} wet <b>adhesive</b> <b>tack.</b> These properties are needed {{to slow down the}} penetration of the adhesive into the paper and wall, and give slow bonding speed which gives the wallpaper hanger time to line up the wallpaper correctly on the wall. The adhesive is usually sold in pouches or boxes as flakes that are mixed with water to produce the paste, it is also available ready mixed in tubs.|$|R
40|$|AbstractNatural {{rubber latex}} (NRL) {{is often used}} to prepare the blended films by solution-casting technique. Its film {{presents}} interesting physical properties in elasticity and adhesiveness. From the good physical properties of NRL, it can beused to prepare transdermal patches which gain popularity due to several advantages such as convenient application, avoid first-pass metabolism, possibly to attain sustained and constant drug levels. However, the skin serves an excellent barrier against drug permeation due to the rigid lamellar structure of the stratum corneum lipids. Enhancers can improve the partition of drug into the stratum corneum by increasing the thermodynamic activity of the drug in transdermal formulations. The aims of this study were (i) to prepare the blended films from deproteinized NRL (DNRL), hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), various enhancers, i. e., fatty acid (oleic acid), ester of fatty acid (isopropyl palmitate; IPP), fatty alcohol (propylene glycol; PG), hydrocarbon (olive oil), and terpene (menthol), and (ii) to study the physical and mechanical properties of the obtained films. The results showed that DNRL could be compatible with all enhancers. Hence, the blended films were characterized for strength (ultimate tensile strength; UTS), elasticity (elongation at break), and adhesiveness (peel strength and <b>tack</b> <b>adhesive).</b> It was found that these characteristics depended on type and concentration of incorporated enhancers...|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{polyethylene}} and polypropylene bonding {{has increased}} in the last years. However, adhesive joints with adherends which are of low surface energy and which are chemically inert present several difficulties. Generally, their high degree of chemical resistance to solvents and dissimilar solubility parameters limit the usefulness of solvent bonding as a viable assembly technique. One successful approach to adhesive bonding of these materials involves proper selection of surface pre-treatment prior to bonding. With the correct pre-treatment {{it is possible to}} glue these materials with one or more of several adhesives required by the applications involved. A second approach is the use of adhesives without surface pre-treatment, such as hot melts, high <b>tack</b> pressure-sensitive <b>adhesives,</b> solvent-based specialty adhesives and, more recently, structural acrylic adhesives as such 3 M DP- 8005 ® and Loctite 3030 ®. In this paper, the shear strengths of two acrylic adhesives were evaluated using the lap shear test method ASTM D 3163 and the block shear test method ASTM D 4501. Two different industrial polyolefins (polyethylene and polypropylene) were used for adherends. However, the focus {{of this study was to}} measure the shear strength of polyethylene joints with acrylic adhesives. The effect of abrasion was also studied. Some test specimens were manually abraded using 180 and 320 grade abrasive paper. An additional goal of this work was to examine the effect of temperature and moisture on mechanical strength of adhesive joints...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{destructive}} distillation of birch bark to produce tar has recently featured in {{debates about the}} technological and cognitive abilities of Neandertals and modern humans. The abilities to precisely control fire temperatures and to manipulate adhesive properties are believed to require advanced mental traits. However, the significance given to adhesive technology in these debates has quickly outgrown our understanding of birch bark tar and its manufacture using aceramic techniques. In this paper, we detail three experimental methods of Palaeolithic tar production ranging from simple to complex. We recorded the fuel, time, materials, temperatures, and tar yield for each method and compared them with the tar known from the Palaeolithic. Our results indicate {{that it is possible}} to obtain useful amounts of tar by combining materials and technology already in use by Neandertals. A ceramic container is not required, and temperature control need not be as precise as previously thought. However, Neandertals must have been able to recognize certain material properties, such as <b>adhesive</b> <b>tack</b> and viscosity. In this way, they could develop the technology from producing small traces of tar on partially burned bark to techniques capable of manufacturing quantities of tar equal to those found in the Middle Palaeolithic archaeological record...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{developed}} epoxy paste adhesives were {{electron beam}} cured and experimentally explored {{to determine their}} suitability for use in an aerospace-quality aircraft component. There were two major goals for this program. The first {{was to determine whether}} the electron beam-curable past adhesives were capable of meeting the requirements of the US Air Force T- 38 supersonic jet trainer composite windshield frame. The T- 38 windshield frame`s arch is currently manufactured by bonding thin stainless steel plies using an aerospace-grade thermally-cured epoxy film adhesive. The second goal was to develop the lowest cost hand layup and debulk process {{that could be used to}} produce laminated steel plies with acceptable properties. The laminate properties examined to determine adhesive suitability include laminate mechanical and physical properties at room, <b>adhesive</b> <b>tack,</b> out-time capability, and the debulk requirements needed to achieve these properties. Eighteen past adhesives and four scrim cloths were experimentally examined using this criteria. One paste adhesive was found to have suitable characteristics in each of these categories and was later chosen for the manufacture of the T- 38 windshield frame. This experimental study shows that by using low-cost debulk and layup processes, the electron beam-cured past adhesive mechanical and physical properties meet the specifications of the T- 38 composite windshield frame...|$|R
40|$|Pressure {{sensitive}} adhesive (PSA) {{materials have}} significant {{negative impact on}} paper recycling. PSA materials are hard to remove in recycling and deposit on equipment and are retained in the product, severely hampering operations. This research had as an objective to evaluate if some PSA properties could be predictors of the removal of PSA materials with pressure screens in paper recycling. Several PSA materials were pulped, characterized for particle size and then subjected to a single slot screening experiment. The PSA materials properties of glass transition temperature, contact angle, yield strain, yield stress, and modulus were determined. Statistical modeling determined that the particle size after pulping was not significantly related to any individual PSA property. Statistical modeling determined that particle passage in a pressurized screen was negatively related to both yield stress and particle dimensions. A hot melt adhesive PSA had a very different screenability than did acrylate based adhesives. The hot melt adhesive was found to fold upon itself into a more spherical shape and to also to contain more attached fibers, in agreement with a higher <b>tack</b> for this <b>adhesive</b> than acrylate adhesives. The passage of the PSA adhesives particles could be modeled with moderate accuracy using a simple extrusion model. The model had yield stress as a fitting parameter and the calculated yield stress from the model was {{in agreement with the}} yield stresses measured for the PSA materials. These findings indicate that particle size and cohesive energy are critical to the design of PSA materials that will not extrude through a pressurized screen...|$|R
