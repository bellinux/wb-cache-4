While twin-roll strip casting is oscillating periodically, the velocity of the <b>center</b> <b>line</b> in X direction is affected, and the change along the X direction is similar with that along the Y direction. The <b>center</b> <b>line</b> velocity in one cycle increases with the increasing of amplitude or frequency. However, because the metal flow in the molten pool is still dominated by the Y direction (casting roller direction), there is little change in the velocity of the <b>center</b> <b>line</b> in the X direction.|$|R

5000|$|In Oregon in April 1917, {{a yellow}} <b>center</b> <b>line</b> was painted {{down the center}} of the Columbia River Highway, between Crown Point and Multnomah Falls, at the {{direction}} of Multnomah County Sheriff's Deputy Peter Rexford. Later in 1917, the same line was continued west of Crown Point. Rexford first conceived the idea of a yellow <b>center</b> <b>line</b> in early 1917 while riding on a bus from Salem, Oregon on a dark and rainy night, and advocated it as a safety measure on the Columbia River Highway, which Rexford patrolled as a traffic officer. When Multnomah County declined to fund the project, Rexford's boss, Chief Deputy Martin T. Pratt (later elected Sheriff), paid for the paint out of his own pocket so that the <b>center</b> <b>line</b> could be painted. Rexford later described the April 1917 line as the [...] "first yellow <b>center</b> <b>line</b> ever painted on pavement" [...] in the United States. An article published in The Oregonian upon Rexford's retirement claimed that a contest with a $10,000 reward was once held to determine the originator of the highway <b>center</b> <b>line,</b> but the contest was scrapped when information from Europe revealed that ancient civilizations had used white bricks to mark the <b>center</b> <b>lines</b> of their streets.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis article {{deals with}} the effects of a blowing ratio {{measured}} with narrowband liquid crystal in transonic experiments on the heat transfer characteristics of trailing edge cutback. The experimental results are compared and contrasted in terms of available data for traditional experiments with thermocouples. It is concluded that the blowing ratio exerts rather significant effects on film cooling effectiveness distribution of the rib <b>center</b> <b>line.</b> As the blowing ratio decreases, similar to the cooling effectiveness distribution curve of the slot <b>center</b> <b>line,</b> that of the rib <b>center</b> <b>line</b> makes a clockwise rotation about the end. When the blowing ratio increases, the regular film cooling effectiveness curve of the surface becomes rather smooth. On the whole measuring surface, the most intensive heat transfer occurs at the extended borderline of the slot and the rib, neither at the rib <b>center</b> <b>line</b> nor at the slot <b>center</b> <b>line.</b> The experimental results of cooling effectiveness measured with thermocouples are lower than those with liquid crystal. In addition, the transient experiments using narrowband liquid crystal can eliminate the higher errors of Nusselt numbers in measurements with thermocouples at the slot outlet...|$|R
