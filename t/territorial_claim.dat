5|$|In 2003, Norwegian {{authorities}} {{decided to}} extend its operations in Antarctica by establishing an all-year research station. By then, Norway was the only country with a <b>territorial</b> <b>claim</b> to Antarctica to not have an all-year research station on the continent. Construction was carried out from December 2004 through February 2005. To ease logistics, Norway took the initiative to establish Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN), a cooperation between the countries with bases in Queen Maud Land to streamline transport costs. The permanent Troll Airfield was opened on 11 February 2005.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, it {{was decided}} that Norway was to extend its {{operations}} in Antarctica by establishing an all-year research station. By then, Norway was the only country with a <b>territorial</b> <b>claim</b> to Antarctica to not have an all-year research station on the continent. The government stated that the investment was motivated to improve climate research, to strengthen Norway as a bi-polar research nation and to strengthen Norway's role as a premise-maker in the environmental policy of the Antarctic.|$|E
5|$|While {{based in}} Newfoundland, Admiral Murray hosted {{a visit from}} the Free French Admiral Muselier. Acting on orders from the Admiralty, Murray gave Muselier {{temporary}} command of three French corvettes and a submarine that were assigned to Murray's fleet, for passage to Halifax. On return from Halifax, Muselier took the vessels to Vichy-controlled Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and on 24 December 1941 raised the Free French flag on the islands. This was interpreted as a <b>territorial</b> <b>claim</b> on behalf of General Charles de Gaulle, thereby creating a diplomatic incident between France, Canada and the United States. De Gaulle's seizure of the archipelago was over the opposition of Canada, Great Britain, and the United States, which were concerned about pushing the Vichy government into an openly pro-German stance.|$|E

40|$|We use the Issue Correlates of War (ICOW) project's <b>territorial</b> <b>claims</b> data {{to study}} the {{effectiveness}} of international legal means for dispute settlement. We discuss the importance of <b>territorial</b> <b>claims</b> {{as a source of}} interstate conflict and the possible value of international law for settling conflict. We test hypotheses on the role of law in settling <b>territorial</b> <b>claims,</b> focusing on South American <b>territorial</b> <b>claims</b> since 1816. Empirical analyses reveal that legal options for dispute settlement, including both bilateral negotiations and a range of third party activities, can be effective for resolving <b>territorial</b> <b>claims</b> between sovereign states. Characteristics of specific claims and of the claimants can reduce the effectiveness of legal options, though; legal settlements {{are less likely to be}} effective when the adversaries have a history of militarized conflict and when the claimed territory is seen as possessing greater salience. We conclude by discussing the implications of our study for further research and for policymakers. Numerous scholars have noted that <b>territorial</b> <b>claims</b> between nation-states are a leading cause of militarized conflict and war (e. g., Vasquez 1993; Huth 1996; Hensel 1997).

5|$|James Brooke {{started to}} rule Sarawak (present day Kuching) in 1841 after he {{obtained}} the territory from the Bruneian Empire. In 1853, Sarawak {{has expanded its}} territory to include the Sibu region. Sibu was a small village with several shop-houses. Such shophouses were built with atap roofs, wooden walls, and floors. The earliest inhabitants of Sibu were Melanau people, followed by Ibans, and Malay people in the 1850s. There {{used to be a}} Sibu Fort (Fort Brooke), which was built by Rajah Brooke in 1862. The fort was located at the present day Channel Road in Sibu. It served as an administrative centre for the Brookes in Sibu. However, it was demolished in 1936. It was common for the White Rajah to build such forts to stake his <b>territorial</b> <b>claim</b> as well as means of protection.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand is a {{developed}} country and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as health, education, economic freedom {{and quality of}} life. Since the 1980s, New Zealand has transformed from an agrarian, regulated economy to a market economy. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister, who is currently Jacinda Ardern. Queen Elizabeth II is the country's head of state and is represented by a governor-general, currently Dame Patsy Reddy. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's <b>territorial</b> <b>claim</b> in Antarctica. New Zealand {{is a member of}} the United Nations, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Pacific Islands Forum, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand {{is one of}} 16 realms {{within the}} Commonwealth. The Realm of New Zealand is the entire area over which the Queen of New Zealand is sovereign, and {{comprises}} New Zealand, Tokelau, the Ross Dependency, the Cook Islands and Niue. The Cook Islands and Niue are self-governing states in free association with New Zealand. The New Zealand Parliament cannot pass legislation for these countries, but with their consent can act on behalf of them in foreign affairs and defence. Tokelau is a non-self-governing territory, but is administered by a council of three elders (one from each Tokelauan atoll). The Ross Dependency is New Zealand's <b>territorial</b> <b>claim</b> in Antarctica, where it operates the Scott Base research facility. New Zealand nationality law treats {{all parts of the}} realm equally, so most people born in New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau and the Ross Dependency are New Zealand citizens.|$|E

25|$|On 11 February 2013, a {{group of}} {{approximately}} 100–200 individuals, some of them armed, arrived by boat in Lahad Datu, Sabah from Simunul island, Tawi-Tawi in the southern Philippines. They were sent by Jamalul Kiram III, one of the claimants to the throne of the Sultanate of Sulu. Their objective was to assert their unresolved <b>territorial</b> <b>claim</b> to North Borneo. During the ensuing standoff, 56 of his followers were killed, along with 6 civilians and 10 Malaysian security forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} Republic of Texas won {{the decisive}} Battle of San Jacinto (April 21, 1836) against Mexico and captured Mexican president Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. He signed the Treaties of Velasco, which recognized the Rio Grande as {{the boundary of}} the Republic of Texas. The treaties were then repudiated {{by the government of}} Mexico, which insisted that it was sovereign over Texas and promised to reclaim the lost territories. To the extent that there was a de facto recognition, Mexico treated the Nueces River as its northern boundary control. A huge, largely-unsettled area was between the two rivers. Neither Mexico nor the Republic of Texas had the military strength to assert its <b>territorial</b> <b>claim.</b> On December 29, 1845, the Republic of Texas was annexed to the United States and became the 28th state. Texas was staunchly committed to slavery, with its constitution making illegal for the legislature to free slaves. With the annexation, the United States inherited the territorial claims of the former Republic of Texas against Mexico. The <b>territorial</b> <b>claim</b> to the area between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande and Mexican resistance to it both led to the Mexican–American War. On February 2, 1848, the war was concluded by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{acquired}} a <b>territorial</b> <b>claim</b> {{to the eastern}} Rocky Mountains with the Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803.

In 1806, Zebulon Pike led a U.S. Army reconnaissance expedition into the disputed region. Colonel Pike and his men were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the San Luis Valley the following February, taken to Chihuahua, and expelled from Mexico the following July.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th {{century and}} {{beginning}} of the 20th century, American explorers, including Robert Peary, explored the northern sections of Greenland, which up to that time had been a mystery and were often shown on maps as extending over the North Pole. Peary discovered that Greenland's northern coast in fact stopped well short of the pole. These discoveries were considered to be the basis of an American <b>territorial</b> <b>claim</b> in the area. But after the United States purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917, it agreed to relinquish all claims on Greenland.|$|E
25|$|The colony {{included}} the current islands of New Zealand. In 1817, the British government withdrew the extensive <b>territorial</b> <b>claim</b> over the South Pacific. In practice, the governors' writ had been shown {{not to run}} in the islands of the South Pacific. The Church Missionary Society had concerns over atrocities committed against the natives of the South Sea Islands, and the ineffectiveness of the New South Wales government to deal with the lawlessness. As a result, on 27 June 1817, Parliament passed an Act for the more effectual Punishment of Murders and Manslaughters committed in Places not within His Majesty's Dominions, which described Tahiti, New Zealand and other islands of the South Pacific as being not within His Majesty's dominions.|$|E

25|$|The Yugoslav People's Liberation War began officially in 1941 in the {{territory}} of the Republic of Macedonia. On 2 August 1944 (St. Elias's Day), honoring the fighters of the Ilinden Uprising, the Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM), meeting in Serbia, constituted the Macedonian state (Democratic Federal Macedonia) as a federal state {{within the framework of the}} future Yugoslav federation. In 1946 the People's Republic of Macedonia was established as a federal component of the newly proclaimed Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito. The issue of the republic's name immediately sparked controversy with Greece over Greek concerns that it presaged a <b>territorial</b> <b>claim</b> on the Greek coastal region of Macedonia (see Territorial concerns below). The US Roosevelt administration expressed the same concern through Edward Stettinius in 1944. The Greek press and the Greek government of Andreas Papandreou continued to express the above concerns confronting the views of Yugoslavia during the 1980s and until the Revolutions of 1989.|$|E
25|$|The French {{extended}} their <b>territorial</b> <b>claim</b> {{to the south}} and {{to the west of the}} American colonies late in the 17th century, naming it for King Louis XIV, as La Louisiane. In 1682, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle explored the Ohio River Valley and the Mississippi River Valley, and he claimed the entire territory for France as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. La Salle attempted to establish the first southern colony in the new territory in 1685, but inaccurate maps and navigational issues led him to instead establish his Fort Saint Louis in what is now Texas. The colony was devastated by disease, and the surviving settlers were killed in 1688, in an attack by the area's indigenous population. Other parts of Louisiana were settled and developed with success, such as New Orleans and southern Illinois, leaving a strong French influence in these areas long after the Louisiana Purchase.|$|E
25|$|In 1617, Dutch colonists built a fort at the {{confluence}} of the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers where Albany now stands. In 1624, New Netherland became a province of the Dutch Republic, which had lowered the northern border of its North American dominion to 42 degrees latitude in acknowledgment of the claim by the English north of Cape Cod. The Dutch named the three main rivers of the province the Zuyd Rivier (South River), the Noort Rivier (North River), and the Versche Rivier (Fresh River). Discovery, charting, and permanent settlement were needed to maintain a <b>territorial</b> <b>claim.</b> To this end in May 1624, the VOC landed 30 families at Fort Orange and Noten Eylant (today's Governors Island) {{at the mouth of the}} North River. They disembarked from the ship New Netherland, under the command of Cornelis Jacobsz May, the first Director of the New Netherland. He was replaced the following year by Willem Verhulst.|$|E
