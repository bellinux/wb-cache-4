5|$|Jake Gyllenhaal was {{the first}} to be cast in the film; after {{receiving}} the script, he read it in an hour and immediately contacted Ayer. Michael Peña was cast shortly after, following a string of auditions. He and Gyllenhaal did not bond immediately but gradually became close friends over the process of training and filming. Gyllenhaal and Peña undertook five months of intensive training under the guidance of FitzSimons to prepare for their roles—this included 12-hour ride-alongs with multiple Greater Los Angeles Area law enforcement agencies up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> week, as well as training in hand-to-hand combat, police tactics and weapons. On his first ride-along, Gyllenhaal witnessed a murder during a drug bust. Tactical training was also given to the other actors playing police officers, including David Harbour, America Ferrera, Cody Horn, and Frank Grillo.|$|E

25|$|In 1973, {{the area}} around the old railway station was {{developed}} into a container port facility, with P & O operating a container service to Larne in Northern Ireland. In 1975, this became a Roll-on/roll-off service. This development led indirectly to some renewal of the then largely derelict Dock Street area, and improved road access to the town to support the container traffic. Twice-daily container service continued until 2004 when Stena Line bought the route and increased the service <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> day. In December 2010, Stena Line announced that the service would be withdrawn at the end of 2010, with the loss of 140 jobs.|$|E

25|$|The canal prospered, and in 1788, {{a regular}} service {{transporting}} goods between Huddersfield and Wakefield was operating {{three times a}} week. During the 1790s, goods were carried over the Pennines by road, with one service, operated by Richard Milnes, connecting Manchester to Huddersfield. In 1796, he operated daily sailings onwards from Huddersfield to Wakefield, where the Calder and Hebble Navigation connected to the Aire and Calder Navigation, on which there was a daily connection to Hull. Just a year later, he operated one or more boats a day between the upper terminus of the Calder and Hebble at Sowerby Bridge and Hull, while the service from Huddersfield to Wakefield reverted <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> week. At the time, {{the construction of the}} broad Rochdale Canal was making progress towards Sowerby Bridge, while the Huddersfield Narrow Canal was struggling with the excavation of Standedge Tunnel, the longest, deepest and highest on the English canal system. The Rochdale Canal provided a trans-Pennine route from 1804, and Sowerby Bridge remained more important than Huddersfield, even after the Huddersfield Narrow opened throughout in 1811.|$|E
500|$|Busch {{had little}} contact with his natural parents during this period. At the time, the [...] journey between Wiedensahl and Ebergötzen took three days by horse. His father visited Ebergötzen two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> year, while his mother stayed in Wiedensahl {{to look after the}} children. The 12-year-old Busch visited his family once; his mother at first did not {{recognize}} him. Some Busch biographers think that this early separation from his parents, especially from his mother, resulted in his eccentric bachelorhood. In the autumn of 1846, Busch moved with the Kleine's to Lüthorst, where, on 11 April 1847, he was confirmed.|$|E

500|$|Harris Farms, where California Chrome was bred, foaled, {{and lived}} {{until the age}} of two, had {{previously}} nurtured champions such as two-time Breeders' Cup Classic winner Tiznow. In 2010 Love the Chase was bred to the Harris Farms stallion Lucky Pulpit. CNN reported that the stud fee for the breeding was $2,000. Steve Coburn said he had a dream three weeks before California Chrome's birth that the foal would be a colt with four white feet and a blaze. California Chrome was relatively large for a newborn horse, weighing , and active, [...] "running circles around Momma" [...] within two hours of birth. Love the Chase suffered a uterine laceration while foaling, and was placed on an IV due to internal bleeding. [...] The mare and foal were stall-bound together for over a month. She was kept on a catheter that administered anti-bleeding medication, and the farm staff checked her two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> day. Because people gave the colt extra attention and affection when they cared for his dam, he imprinted on humans as well as his mother. As a result, California Chrome became very people-focused, a trait that has served him well in race training.|$|E
500|$|In the 19th century, Denmark's main food export was grain to the UK, {{but it was}} outcompeted by the United States and Russia {{and began}} to switch to pigs and butter from dairy herds. [...] From 1840 to 1870 grain was almost half of Denmark's exports, but by 1900 this had fallen to under 3 per cent. [...] Denmark {{exported}} bacon to the United Kingdom from at least 1847, when flitches of bacon were specially prepared for the English market, but had no large-scale production until 1864, when the Second Schleswig War made export of live pigs to Hamburg, where up to then they had been slaughtered and cured, impossible and Denmark was forced to do this locally. [...] However, export to the UK only became significant after Germany, to whom Denmark had been exporting since the Middle Ages, erected trade barriers to (1879), and finally banned (1887), the import of live pigs. [...] The lost German market amounted to almost 300,000 pigs per year and Denmark desperately needed {{to find a new}} market. [...] The Danish imports were welcomed in the UK; the growth in population following the Industrial Revolution meant that the country was no longer self-sufficient in food, but there was an increasing demand from a more affluent working class. [...] At the time, British workers on average pay consumed bacon two <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> week, and bacon and eggs became the traditional British breakfast. [...] This had previously been quite unaffordable for the working class. [...] By the end of the 19th century, 90% of Danish pig exports went to the UK and accounted for 20% of total Danish exports. [...] This made Denmark the main supplier to the UK, replacing the U.S. which previously held that position. [...] Danish Bacon still had more than 25% of the UK market in the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} the new free daily {{newspaper}} has been imitated by other publishers.
