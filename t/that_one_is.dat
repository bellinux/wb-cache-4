5|$|The Republic of Lebanon's Identity Card is {{the main}} form of {{identification}} on {{the territory of the}} Republic of Lebanon. All Lebanese are obliged by law to carry their identity cards with them at all times and are subject to fines should they not. According to the Lebanese obligation of identification, it is compulsory for all Lebanese citizens habitually resident in the Republic of Lebanon, aged 15 or older, to possess either an identity card or a passport noting that the earlier offers no benefits compared to the passport with the exception of being easier to carry in a wallet or a handbag. It enables bearers to log into certain services on the Internet, local computers or add a digital signatures into LibreOffice ODF documents or create DigiDoc formatted containers that also allows encryption during content transfer.

25|$|The {{orientation}} of the palm is indicated by filling in the glyph for the hand shape. A hollow outline (white) glyph indicates <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> facing the palm of the hand, a filled (black) glyph indicates <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> facing {{the back of the}} hand, and split shading indicates <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> seeing the hand from the side. Although in reality the wrist may turn to intermediate positions, only the four orientations of palm, back, and either side are represented in SignWriting, as they are enough to represent sign languages.|$|E

Whatever sensory stimuli are attended to can be declared knowledge.|$|E

There is no difference in their power or in their gender, and they could be one entity, but they are indeed two, distinguished only by their names.|$|E
25|$|Affine {{transformations of}} the plane are useful for {{studying}} equidissections, including translations, uniform and non-uniform scaling, reflections, rotations, shears, and other similarities and linear maps. Since an affine transformation preserves straight lines and ratios of areas, it sends equidissections to equidissections. This means <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> free to apply any affine transformation to a polygon that might give it a more manageable form. For example, {{it is common to}} choose coordinates such that three of the vertices of a polygon are (0, 1), (0, 0), and (1, 0).|$|E
