5|$|A final {{showdown}} ensues with Lazarus, {{in which}} Jericho arises victorious, and a choice is given {{for him to}} side with either Cassidy or Tala. Either Jericho rids the West of the Curse of Lazarus, or he becomes the Curse; the player's choice determines how the game ends. If the character were to choose <b>the</b> <b>good</b> option, then the final fight will be against the vampiric Tala; if the player chooses to take Lazarus' curse for himself, then he must fight the ghost of Cassidy. The bad ending shows the now-monstrous Jericho killing Tala and riding into the night, while <b>the</b> <b>good</b> ending shows Cassidy's soul being released.|$|E

5|$|In his {{combined}} works, Kant {{constructed the}} basis for an ethical law from the concept of duty. Kant began his ethical theory by arguing that the only virtue that can be unqualifiedly good is a good will. No other virtue has this status because every other virtue {{can be used to}} achieve immoral ends (the virtue of loyalty is not good if one is loyal to an evil person, for example). <b>The</b> <b>good</b> will is unique in that it is always good and maintains its moral value even when it fails to achieve its moral intentions. Kant regarded <b>the</b> <b>good</b> will as a single moral principle which freely chooses to use the other virtues for moral ends.|$|E

The bailiff may choose not to remove <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> immediately, giving <b>the</b> debtor an opportunity to pay the debt (plus the bailiff's costs). In the meantime, the bailiff takes walking possession of <b>the</b> <b>goods.</b> <b>The</b> bailiff may ask the debtor to sign a walking possession agreement, listing <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> that have been seized and acknowledging that the debtor no longer has legal title to <b>the</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|R

50|$|The four rules {{defined by}} Incoterms 2010 for {{international}} trade where transportation is entirely conducted by water are as per the below.

5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{missing trader}} fraud {{is where a}} fraudster imports some <b>goods.</b> <b>The</b> <b>goods</b> were zero-rated {{in the country of}} origin, and VAT on <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> should be paid in the country where they have been imported. After importing, the fraudster sells <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> to another trader charging the price of <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> plus VAT, but doesn't pass on the VAT to the Government. He becomes a [...] "missing trader". The buyer which has paid the VAT to the fraudster, can deduct the same VAT amount on his VAT return. Afterwards, <b>the</b> same <b>goods</b> will be zero-rated for export. This way, the Government has lost the entire VAT that should be paid on <b>the</b> <b>goods,</b> rather than <b>the</b> fraction of it that would be paid for just one stage of the production process. This situation, where <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> are made available for consumers in the importer's home market is often known as 'acquisition fraud'.|$|R
