5|$|Lance Murdoch is {{a parody}} of famous daredevils such as Evel Knievel and Matt Murdock, the alter ego of the Marvel Comics superhero Daredevil. Bart's attempt <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> Springfield Gorge is a {{reference}} to Knievel's 1974 attempt to jump Snake River Canyon at Twin Falls, Idaho, with a Skycycle X-2. Bart appearing at Springfield Gorge in the distance is based on Omar Sharif's entrance in Lawrence of Arabia.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century. Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic {{rules of the}} modern event were standardised there. Athletes have a short run up and then take off from one foot <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area. The men's high jump {{was included in the}} 1896 Olympics and a women's competition followed in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Alyeska {{and the oil}} {{companies}} fought objections to the pipeline's construction in both the courts and in Congress, where debates about the pipeline's environmental impact statement continued through 1971. Objections about the caribou herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a water pipeline with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which caribou were able <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>over.</b> To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the overgrown remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most {{of which had been}} erased 70years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic leak detection and shutoff, and other techniques. Other opponents, including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of a match, a 30-second headstart is given to the Monster so that they can have enough time to escape before the Hunters parachute from a plane to where the Monster started. Each map features an open world environment for players to explore and play within. To help the Hunters navigate the environments quickly, they are equipped with jetpacks, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> obstacles and cliffs. The jetpack {{can also be used to}} dodge attacks performed by the monster, though it consumes a Hunter's energy. The team can track the monster, as well as place waypoints on an interactive map. The color of these waypoints are different based on what players have marked. The waypoint mark turns yellow for environment, orange for wildlife or red for the Monster.|$|E

25|$|In Armenia, {{celebrations}} at the Presentation {{have been}} influenced by pre-Christian customs, such as: the spreading of ashes by farmers in their fields each year to ensure a better harvest, keeping ashes on the roof of a house to keep evil spirits away, and the belief that newlywed women needed <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> fire to purify themselves before getting pregnant. Young men will also leap over a bonfire.|$|E

This was quickly dismissed by both Ljungberg's agents, Claes Elefalk and Scott Duxbury, West Ham's chief executive.|$|E

25|$|Donkey Kong, an arcade game {{created by}} Nintendo and {{released}} in July 1981, {{was the first}} game that allowed players <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> obstacles and across gaps, making it the first true platformer. Donkey Kong had {{a limited amount of}} platforming in its first two screens, but its last two screens had a more pronounced platform jumping component. This game also introduced Mario, a modern icon of the genre, under the name Jumpman. Donkey Kong was ported to many consoles and computers at the time, and the title helped to cement Nintendo's position as an important name in the video game industry internationally.|$|E
25|$|The first {{attempts}} to bring platform games into 3D used 2D graphics and an isometric perspective. These games are nearly {{as old as}} the genre itself, one of the earliest examples being Sega's Congo Bongo in 1983. The first platformers to simulate a 3D perspective and moving camera emerged in the early-mid-1980s. An early example of this was Konami's platform game Antarctic Adventure, where the player controls a penguin in a forward-scrolling third-person perspective while having <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> pits and obstacles. Originally released in 1983 for the MSX computer, it was subsequently ported to various platforms the following year, including an arcade version, NES, and ColecoVision. That same year, I, Robot, though not a platformer, featured filled 3D polygonal graphics, flat shading, and camera control options, which were not widely adopted by platformers until the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} in the {{initiation}} ceremony was the lecture given by the master of ceremonies, called Mabalasig/Mabalasik (terrible brother), who informed the neophyte to withdraw if he lacked courage since he would be out of place in the patriotic society. If the neophyte persisted, he was presented to the assembly of the brethren, who subjected him to various ordeals such as blindfolding him and making him shoot a supposedly a revolver at a person, or forcing him <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> a supposedly hot flame. After the ordeals came to final riteâthe pacto de sangre or blood compactâin which the neophyte signed the oath with blood taken from his arm. He was then accepted as a full-pledged member, with a symbolic name by which he was known within Katipunan circles. Bonifacio's symbolic name was Maypagasa; Jacinto was Pingkian and Artemio Ricarte was Vibora.|$|E

25|$|Simpson's {{victory in}} 1904 coincided with an {{increased}} use of the river for leisure. As he could not charge these boats {{for use of the}} locks, the situation was resolved for a time in 1906 by the formation of the River Ouse Locks Committee, who rented the locks between Great Barford and Bedford. Over 2000 boats were recorded using Bedford Lock in a three-month period soon afterwards. Despite pressure from local authorities and navigation companies, the upper river was closed for trade, and a Royal Commission reported in 1909 on the poor state of the lower river, the lack of any consistent authority to manage it, and the unusual practice of towing horses having <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>over</b> fences because there were no gates where they crossed the towing path. The Ouse Drainage Board was formed in 1918, but had no powers to deal with navigation issues, and {{it was not until the}} powers of the Land Drainage Act (1930) were used to create the Great Ouse Catchment Board that effective action could be taken.|$|E
