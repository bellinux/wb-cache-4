5|$|One area of {{paleontology}} <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> a lot {{of activity}} during the 1980s, 1990s, and beyond is the study of the Cambrian explosion during which many of the various phyla of animals with their distinctive body plans first appear. The well-known Burgess Shale Cambrian fossil site was found in 1909 by Charles Doolittle Walcott, and another important site in Chengjiang China was found in 1912. However, new analysis in the 1980s by Harry B. Whittington, Derek Briggs, Simon Conway Morris and others sparked a renewed interest and a burst of activity including discovery of an important new fossil site, Sirius Passet, in Greenland, and the publication of a popular and controversial book, Wonderful Life by Stephen Jay Gould in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Devil Summoner {{takes place}} in Hirasaki, a coastal Japanese city <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> a recent rise in supernatural activity. The player character, an unnamed college student, is asked to {{accompany}} his girlfriend Kumiko Hatano {{to check out a}} book on the occult for her studies. Going to an amusement park to buy some concert tickers at Kumiko's request, the protagonist is attacked by demons and saved by Kyouji Kuzunoha, a Summoner belonging to an ancient clan dedicated to protecting Japan from supernatural threats. Shortly after leaving him, Kuzunoha dies under mysterious circumstances. Shortly after this, the protagonist is attacked by a Dark Summoner named Sid Davis. Killed by Davis, he is returned {{to the land of the}} living by Charon. Upon waking, the protagonist finds himself in the body of Kuzunoha, who was also killed by Davis. Now trapped in Kuzunoha's body, the protagonist is forced to work in his place to investigate the reasons behind Sid Davis' activities alongside Kuzunoha's partner Rei Reiho: he does this to both protect the city and return Kuzunoha and himself to their original bodies.|$|E
5|$|Though Tech joined {{athletic}} {{conferences in}} other sports during the 1980s, it remained a football independent until 1991, when Virginia Tech {{became a member of}} the Big East conference. In 1993, Tech received an invitation to the Independence bowl, beginning a 16-year streak <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> the Hokies invited to a bowl game at the conclusion of every season since then. In 1995, the Hokies defeated the Texas Longhorns in the 1995 Sugar Bowl, vaulting them into national prominence. In recent years, Virginia Tech football teams have been ranked among the best in the country according to season-ending polls. In 2000, Virginia Tech participated in the 2000 Sugar Bowl, which served as the national championship game of the 1999 college football season. In addition to that appearance, the Hokies have participated in several other Bowl Championship Series games, which represent the highest tier of postseason accomplishment.|$|E

Montana was the only state in the U.S. to turn over a chamber of its legislature to Republican control in 2006. The legislative chamber had a one-seat Democratic majority that then became a one-seat Republican majority.|$|E

25|$|The {{islands are}} home to a notable {{independence}} movement <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> an increase in popularity within recent decades. At the end of World War II, some of the population favoured independence from Denmark, and on 14 September 1946 an independence referendum was held {{on the question of}} secession.

25|$|The Montalbano subregion {{is located}} {{in the shadow of the}} Carmignano DOCG, with much of the best Sangiovese going to that wine. A similar {{situation}} exists in the Colli Senesi which includes the well known DOCG region of Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. Both regions rarely appear on wine labels that are exported out of Tuscany. The Colli Pisane area produces typical Chiantis with the lightest body and color. The Colli Aretini is a relatively new and emerging area <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> an influx of investment and new winemaking in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Vaccines {{have contributed}} to the {{eradication}} of smallpox, one of the most contagious and deadly diseases in humans. Other diseases such as rubella, polio, measles, mumps, chickenpox, and typhoid are nowhere near as common as they were a hundred years ago. As long as {{the vast majority of people}} are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. This effect is called herd immunity. Polio, which is transmitted only between humans, is targeted by an extensive eradication campaign <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> endemic polio restricted to only parts of three countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan). However, the difficulty of reaching all children as well as cultural misunderstandings have caused the anticipated eradication date to be missed several times.|$|E

60|$|She listened bending {{her head}} in a {{movement}} of forced attention; and his voice sounded to her unexpected, far off, with the distant and unearthly ring of voices that we hear in dreams, saying faintly things startling, cruel or absurd, to {{which there is no}} possible reply. To her he had nothing to say! She wrung her hands, glanced over the courtyard with that eager and distracted look that sees nothing, then looked up at the hopeless sky of livid grey and drifting black; at the unquiet mourning of the hot and brilliant heaven <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the beginning of her love, <b>that</b> <b>had</b> heard his entreaties and her answers, <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> his desire and her fear; <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> her joy, her surrender--and his defeat.

25|$|The area <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> some of {{the worst}} terror attacks in modern history has been Iraq as part of the Iraq War. In 2005, there were more than 400 {{incidents}} of suicide bombing attacks, killing more than 2,000 people. In 2006, almost half of all reported terrorist attacks in the world (6,600), {{and more than half of}} all terrorist fatalities (13,000), occurred in Iraq, according to the National Counterterrorism Center of the United States. Along with nationalist groups and criminal, non-political attacks, the Iraqi insurgency includes Islamist insurgent groups, such as Al-Qaeda in Iraq, who favor suicide attacks far more than non-Islamist groups. At least {{some of the}} terrorism has a transnational character in that some foreign Islamic jihadists have joined the insurgency.|$|E
25|$|In Malibu Comics' {{short-lived}} Street Fighter series, Chun-Li {{is depicted}} as having known Ryu and Ken since her late teens, as well as having a romantic interest in Ryu, though both make their first appearances therein fighting each other after he sneaks up on her from behind. She criticizes his overly devout dedication to his training <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> him distance himself from Ken for a long time, while he tires of hearing her desire of revenge against Bison and is aghast at her announcement that she has started working with Interpol. The main storyline did not focus on Chun-Li nor Ryu, but rather the aftermath of Sagat's murder of Ken, which itself was never resolved as the comic was canceled at Capcom's request after only three issues.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{can seem}} mindful of which {{individuals}} have watched {{them in the}} past. In an experiment with Siamese fighting fish, two males were made to fight each other while being watched by a female, whom the males could also see. The winner and the loser of the fight were then, separately, given a choice between spending time next to the watching female or to a new female. The winner courted both females equally, but the loser spent more time next to the new female, avoiding the watcher female. In this species, females prefer males they have seen win a fight over males they have seen losing, and it therefore makes sense for a male to prefer a female that has never seen him {{as opposed to a}} female <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> him lose.|$|E

According to its director Dr. Deliz, The Center's goals are to achieve an integration of three interventions: the school personnel, the clinician, and the home, and to train professionals in all adjacent professional areas.|$|E
25|$|T-72UA1: {{this is a}} {{relatively}} simple upgrade developed for smaller defense budgets of {{the nations of the}} developing world, but one <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> commercial success. The original V-46 engine was replaced with a newer 5TDFMA two-stroke diesel making 1,050hp (775kW) and fitted with an enhanced cooling system for use in tropical environments, which allows the tank to be operated for extended periods at temperatures exceeding 55°C. The tank was also equipped with an EA-10-2 APU with an output of 10kW, allowing the vehicle's systems to be fully powered when stationary without running the main engine, thus drastically reducing fuel consumption. An air-conditioner remains optional. Protection is enhanced with the use of Nozh ERA tiles on the turret while retaining the Kontakt-1 tiles on the hull (however Nozh tiles are compatible with Kontakt-1 mounting points and can be retro-fitted). The main gun, stabilizer and FCS remain unchanged compared to the T-72B. Ethiopia purchased the T-72UA1 with 72 tanks delivered in 2011 and 99 in 2012. The Ukrainian army became a customer in 2014 in response to an immediate need following the eruption of the War in Donbass. It is believed that less than 30 vehicles were ordered.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} some event-specific debates too – such as over the Party's precise {{attitude}} to the Spanish Civil War in 1936, to the Hungarian Uprising of 1956 {{and then to the}} movements for political democracy in the Soviet bloc states in the 1980s. On other, far fewer, occasions, small groups of Party members, sometimes concerned by the Party's pace of growth (or lack of growth in some periods) have developed ideas which have challenged the Party's basic, core positions more clearly. Having initially agreed with the Party's principles and analysis they developed a political critique which challenged these positions at a more fundamental level. But even in these instances, only a handful of disputes have been so serious that they have led to organisational breakaways, and for a political body <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> thousands of members join over a century of activity, this is remarkable. While sometimes damaging to the Party, these have always involved very small numbers of dissidents who have either left the organisation voluntarily or who have been expelled by a Party Poll. In each case they have been more an instance of splintering than splitting. For the historical record, six splinters of the various kinds discussed above can be readily identified. They are detailed below in chronological order.|$|E
