50|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, some {{surgeons}} had become proficient in performing the tracheotomy procedure. The main instruments used were:“Two small scalpels, one short grooved director, a tenaculum, two aneurysm needles {{which may be}} used as retractors, one pair of artery forceps, haemostatic forceps, two pairs of dissecting forceps, a pair of scissors, a sharp-pointed tenotome, a pair of tracheal forceps, a <b>tracheal</b> <b>dilator,</b> tracheotomy tubes, ligatures, sponges, a flexible catheter, and feathers”.Haemostatic forceps were used to control bleeding from separated vessels that were not ligatured because of the urgency of the operation. Generally, they were used to expose the trachea by clamping the isthmus thyroid gland on both sides. To open the trachea physically, a sharp-pointed tentome allowed the surgeon easily to place the ends into the opening of the trachea. The thin points permitted the doctor a better view of his incision. Tracheal dilators, such as the “Golding Bird”, were placed through the opening and then expanded by “turning the screw to which they are attached.” Tracheal forceps, as displayed on the right, were commonly used to extract foreign bodies from the larynx. The optimum tracheal tube at the time caused very little damage to the trachea and “mucus membrane”.|$|E
40|$|Tracheostomy is {{a common}} {{procedure}} in ICU patients. The history of tracheostomies dates back many centuries, with the surgical technique well described by Jackson in 1909; 1 it has changed little since then. Percutaneous tracheostomy was first described by Shelden et al in 1955. 2 In 1985, Ciaglia et al introduced a technique involving serial tracheal dilators over a Seldinger-type wire (Cook, Denmark). 3 In 1990, Griggs et al described a Seldinger-based single dilatation technique using modified Howard Kelly forceps (Sims Portex, UK). 4 Subsequently, Ciaglia’s multiple dilators were modified to a single graded <b>tracheal</b> <b>dilator</b> called the Blue Rhino 5, 6 (Cook, Denmark). At our hospital, percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT) has been used extensively for over a decade. Our preferred method has been the Griggs ’ forceps dilatation. ...|$|E
40|$|In anaesthetized dogs the trachea in situ was perfused arterially with blood, {{and drugs}} were {{injected}} intraarterially. Isoprenaline and the calcium-antagonistic vasodilators, nifedipine and verapamil, increased tracheal blood flow and decreased resting {{tone of the}} trachea. Isoprenaline was equi-effective in producing tracheal vasodilatation and tracheal dilatation. The two calcium-antagonistic vasodilators were less effective <b>tracheal</b> <b>dilators</b> than <b>tracheal</b> vasodilators...|$|R
30|$|Methods: We prospectively {{conducted}} {{this pilot}} study of 28 PCT in coagulopathic patients. We defined the neck anatomy in three categories {{depending on the}} presence of blood vessels in the track of needle even at the lowest visible inter-tracheal space on ultrasound. The unsatisfactory category was defined as presence of multiple vessels in the centre of the field, good category had one blood vessel in the centre of the field, excellent category had clean procedure field with no blood vessels. The technique that we adopted in PCT in unsatisfactory category was liberal instillation of 2  % Xylocaine in the skin and subcutaneous tissue between the vessels and creating a potential space for the needle. We also avoided putting any predetermined incision on the skin during the procedure and followed an entire seldinger technique by dilating the skin and subcutaneous tissue using the 5 Fr <b>tracheal</b> <b>dilator</b> provided in Portex® ULTRAperc®. The entire procedure was done under real time ultrasound guidance. Blood loss was estimated by the number of gauze pieces soaked with blood with one gauze piece soaking 5  ml.|$|E
