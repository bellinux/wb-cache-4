5|$|Emma Goldman {{was born}} on June 27, 1869. Her father used {{violence}} to punish his children, beating them when they disobeyed him. He used a whip on Emma, the most rebellious of them. Her mother provided scarce comfort, rarely calling on Abraham to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> his beatings. Goldman later speculated that her father's furious temper was at least partly a result of sexual frustration.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 FIG {{evolved into}} the European Women's Improvising Group (EWIG), bowing to {{pressure}} to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> their name. FIG were influential on the second-generation improvisation scene and spawned a number of women-only improvising groups and events. FIG were also educational in that they exposed new audiences to improvisation and feminism.|$|E
5|$|Directed by Peter Maris, {{the game}} {{features}} {{a cast of}} 25 actors, all performing {{in front of a}} blue screen. While most games at the time featured 80 to 100 backgrounds, Phantasmagoria includes more than 1,000. A professional Hollywood special effects house worked on the game, and the musical score includes a neo-Gregorian chant performed by a 135-voice choir. Sierra stressed it was intended for adult audiences. The company willingly submitted it to a ratings system, and included a password-protected censoring option within the game to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> the graphic content.|$|E

50|$|In the anime version, some of {{the more}} extreme toilet humor of the manga was <b>toned</b> <b>down,</b> such as Tar-chan's Poop Power Up being changed into Pee-Pee Power-Up. However, male {{genitalia}} was still depicted, which quite rare in today's anime. Additionally, violent and cruel acts such as limbs being cut off were <b>toned</b> <b>down,</b> and characters who had died were later seen alive.|$|R
5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{interest}} in formal education and rarely attended classes, Sylvester was enrolled at Jordan High School. He graduated in 1969 at the age of 21; in his graduation photograph, he appeared in drag wearing a blue chiffon prom dress and beehive hairstyle. By the end of the decade, the Disquotays had begun to drift apart, with a number of them abandoning cross-dressing and others recognizing that they were trans women and undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Sylvester always considered himself male and began to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> the feminine nature of his clothing, aiming for a more androgynous look which combined male and female styles and which was influenced by the fashions of the hippie movement.|$|E
5|$|Dixon was {{primarily}} hired to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> {{much of the}} campiness inherent in the stage musical. The 2007 film's script is based primarily on the stage musical rather than the 1988 film, so several changes already made to the plot for the stage version remain in this version. These include dropping several characters from the 1988 version (such as Arvin Hodgepile (the role Mr. Spritzer fills), Velma's husband Franklin, Corny's assistant Tammy, the beatniks, et al.), removing the Tilted Acres amusement park from the story, and placing Velma {{in charge of the}} station where The Corny Collins Show is filmed.|$|E
5|$|Emotions {{contains}} influences from mostly 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry and gospel, {{as well as}} her continued work of R and soul. The album, while {{praised by}} some as more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort, while selling far less and failed to introduce Carey into a different market. Following these events, Columbia decided to try to market Carey in a similar fashion to her debut, only having her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Their plans were to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> Carey's vocals, and soften the album's production, leaving a more contemporary pop/R record. Agreeing to the change, Carey and Afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box.|$|E

5|$|Operation Ferdinand formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. During early 1944 {{the main thrust of}} deceptions in the Middle Eastern theatre were contained under Operation Zeppelin (including its sub-plan Vendetta), which developed threats against Greece and Southern France, and Operation Royal Flush, which ran political deceptions against Spain and Turkey. On 14 June the Allies committed to a landing in Southern France, codenamed Operation Dragoon (formerly Anvil). Royal Flush and Zeppelin were scaled back, to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> the threat to France, and it was decided a new plan (Ferdinand) was required to cover the intended invasion.|$|E
5|$|The film began {{development}} in 2004, and Dixon reworked Meehan and O'Donnell's {{first draft of}} the screenplay to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> the musical's campiness. In 2005, Shankman agreed to direct the film. Composer/lyricist Marc Shaiman and lyricist Scott Wittman reworked their songs from the Broadway musical for the film's soundtrack, and also wrote four new songs for the film. Principal photography commenced in September 2006 and ended in December of that year; filming took place on locations in Toronto, Ontario and Hamilton, Ontario in Canada and on soundstages at Toronto's Showline Studios. Recording sessions for the film's songs and soundtrack took place in Los Angeles, California in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the book}} {{originally}} sold very slowly, {{it became a}} Publishers Weekly bestseller. The Fall of Reach {{would go on to}} sell more than 100,000 copies by 2003 and a million copies by December 2009. The novel's success convinced Microsoft and Del Ray to pen a three-novel publishing contract for novels based on Xbox games, including another Halo novel. The next entry in the Halo novel franchise would be 2003's , written by William C. Dietz. The more human Chief seen in the novel led Bungie to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> the character model in Halo 2 to make him less an exaggerated robot and more a real person inside a suit.|$|E

5|$|From January 1996 onwards, Ranariddh's {{relations}} with Hun Sen {{began to show}} signs of tension. Hun Sen submitted a government circular to reinstate 7 January as a national holiday, the anniversary of Phnom Penh's liberation from the Khmer Rouge by Vietnamese forces. Ranariddh added his signature to the circular, which incurred the ire of Sihanouk and several FUNCINPEC leaders. A few days later, apparently to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> dissatisfaction from party members, Ranariddh publicly accused the Army of Vietnam of encroaching into the territories of four Cambodian provinces bordering it. As Widyono saw it, Ranariddh intended to test Hun Sen's response to his accusations, of which the latter chose to remain quiet. During a closed-door FUNCINPEC meeting in the later part of January 1996, party members criticised Hun Sen and the CPP for monopolizing government power, and also chided Ranariddh for being too subservient to Hun Sen.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the middle}} of 24s run, the series {{attracted}} significant criticism for its depictions of torture, {{as well as its}} negative portrayal of Muslims. The frequent use of ticking time bomb scenarios in storylines, as well as the main character, Jack Bauer portraying torture as normal, effective, acceptable and glamorous, was criticized by human rights activists, military officials, and experts in questioning and interrogation, with concerns raised that junior U.S. soldiers were imitating techniques shown on the series. In response to these concerns, members of the U.S. military met with the creators of the show. Partly {{as a result of these}} discussions, and the military's appeal to the creators of the show to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> the scenes of torture since it was having an impact on U.S. troops, there was a reduction in torture in subsequent seasons of the series. However, the writers stated that they reduced the number of torture scenes, not as a concession, but because it was starting to overwhelm the storytelling.|$|E
5|$|Carey's debut studio album made {{a strong}} impact on pop music, but the singer became {{interested}} in altering her sound and branching out into other genres for her second studio effort, Emotions (1991). Columbia allowed her to take more control over her musical direction, enabling her to change the musical genre, melodies, and production style. Carey worked with many new musicians and producers on the album; Walter Afanasieff being the only holdover from her debut. Emotions contained influences from 1950s, 60s, and 70s balladry, gospel, R and soul music. The album, while praised by some as being more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort; selling fewer units and failing to introduce Carey into new markets. Columbia decided to return Carey to the same genre as her debut album and have her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly record. Their plans were to <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> Carey's vocals and soften the album's production to create a contemporary pop record. Carey and Afanasieff agreed to the change and began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box (1993).|$|E

5|$|On 23 March 1998, Braathens SAFE {{changed its}} name and {{corporate}} identity to Braathens. It introduced a new livery with a blue bottom, and replaced the Norwegian flag on the tail with an abstract, silver wing, that became the company's new logo. The re-branding {{was an attempt to}} create an international identity, and <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> the Norwegian national symbols that had been on the airplanes since 1946. At the same time, a two-class configuration was introduced: the 'Best' section, accounting for 70% of the planes capacity, received higher seat pitch, complimentary in-flight drinks, meals and newspapers, priority boarding and refundable tickets. The 'Back' section was for discount ticket holders, who received a no-frills service with a smaller seat pitch, and were located {{at the back of the}} aircraft behind a curtain. Best tickets became NOK300 more expensive, while it became easier to purchase discounted tickets. The scheme was, according to Erik G. Braathen, an attempt to differentiate between the full-fare customers, with whom Braathens was competing with SAS, and the low-fare customers, who Braathens was competing with Ryanair and the to-be established Color Air. The scheme as first introduced on the first 737-700 that was delivered.|$|E
5|$|Levine {{confirmed}} in March 2013 {{that the film}} has been officially cancelled. Levine stated that after Warner's Watchmen film in 2009 did not {{do as well as}} the studio expected, they had concerns with the $200 million budget that Verbinski had for the BioShock film. They asked him to consider doing the film on a smaller $80 million budget, but Verbinski did not want to accept this. In February 2017, Verbinski said that his crew were about eight weeks from starting filming, with plans for many elaborate sets given that the setting of Rapture could not be something easily shot on existing locations, requiring the $200 million budget. Verbinski was anticipating on releasing the film with an R-rating, when Universal approached him about changing the film's direction. Universal requested that he <b>tone</b> <b>down</b> the film and aim instead for a PG-13 movie, which would be able to draw more audiences to the film and recoup the larger budget he asked for. Verbinski insisted on keeping the R-rating, and refused the smaller budget Universal offered to make the R-rated version. Universal felt that that expensive a film with the limited R-rating would be too much of a risk, and pulled him from the film. Universal then subsequently brought in a new director to work with the smaller budget, but Levine and 2K Games did not feel that the new director was a good fit with the material. Universal then let Levine make the decision to end the project, which he did believing that the film would not work with the current set of compromises {{they would have had to}} make.|$|E
