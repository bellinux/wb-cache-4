The campaign for autonomy of Khūzestān was largely forgotten in the wake of the hostilities, as was the DRFLA.|$|E
5|$|After the 1990–91 Gulf War, UNSCOM {{determined}} <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> {{been pursuing}} a calutron program to enrich uranium. Iraq chose {{to develop the}} electromagnetic process over more modern, economic, and efficient methods of enrichment because calutrons were easier to build, with fewer technical challenges, and the components required to build them were not subject to export controls. At the time the program was discovered, Iraq {{was estimated to be}} two or three years away from producing enough material for nuclear weapons. The program was destroyed in the Gulf War. Consequently, the Nuclear Suppliers Group added the electromagnetic separation equipment to its guidelines for transfers of nuclear-related dual-use equipment, material and technology.|$|E

50|$|For example, two tested {{hypotheses}} {{could be}} <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> WMD or <b>Iraq</b> does not <b>have</b> WMD. If the {{evidence showed that}} it is more likely there are WMDs in Iraq then two new hypotheses could be formulated: WMD are in Baghdad or WMD are in Mosul. Or perhaps, the analyst may need to know what type of WMD Iraq has; the new hypotheses could be <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> biological WMD, <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> chemical WMD and <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> nuclear WMD. By giving the ACH structure, the analyst is able to give a nuanced estimate.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the major}} issues during ElBaradei’s second term as the {{director}} general of the IAEA was the agency’s inspections in Iraq. ElBaradei disputed the U.S. rationale for the 2003 invasion of Iraq {{from the time of the}} 2002 Iraq disarmament crisis, when he, along with Hans Blix, led a team of UN weapons inspectors in Iraq. ElBaradei told the UN Security Council in March 2003 that documents purporting to show <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> tried to acquire uranium from Niger were not authentic.|$|E
25|$|During this {{political}} and social crisis, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein attempted {{to take advantage of}} the disorder of the Revolution, the weakness of the Iranian military and the revolution's antagonism with Western governments. The once-strong Iranian military had been disbanded during the revolution, and with the Shah ousted, Hussein had ambitions to position himself as the new strong man of the Middle East, and sought to expand Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf by acquiring territories <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> claimed earlier from Iran during the Shah's rule.|$|E

25|$|Kelly {{believed}} it was most likely <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> retained some biological weapons {{after the end of}} inspections. After the end of the ground war, he was invited to join the inspection team attempting to find any trace {{of weapons of mass destruction}} programmes and was apparently enthusiastic about resuming his work there. He made two attempted trips to Iraq. The first was on 19 May 2003 when he was prevented from entering Iraq from Kuwait because he did not have the proper documents.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Ritter wrote Endgame: Solving the Iraq Problem— Once and For All {{in which}} he reiterated his claim <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> {{obstructed}} the work of inspectors and attempted to hide and preserve essential elements for restarting WMD programs at a later date. However, he also expressed frustration at alleged attempts by the CIA to infiltrate UNSCOM and use the inspectors {{as a means of}} gathering intelligence with which to pursue regime change in Iraq – a violation of the terms under which UNSCOM operated, and the very rationale the Iraqi government had given in restricting the inspector's activities in 1998.|$|E
25|$|By March 28, 2006, some bloggers were {{reporting}} {{that on the}} basis of interviews with people close to the Plame investigation, indictments against Rove or National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley were imminent. However, by mid-June 2006, it was announced that no charges would be brought against Rove. In early April, The New York Times ran a front page story linking Libby to a leak, supposedly ordered by Dick Cheney, <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> been attempting to acquire uranium in 2002. By the thirteenth of the month, many media outlets, including the New York Times, retracted this story, after discovering that the basis of this claim was based on papers filed with the courts the previous week. These papers themselves were corrected via formal statements from Fitzgerald.|$|E

25|$|During {{and after}} his spell as NATO {{secretary}} general (see below) Solana continued to {{play an active role}} in PSOE and Spanish politics. In June 1997, at the 34th PSOE Congress, Solana left their Executive Commission and joined their Federal Committee, being re-elected in second place three years later. By supporting Colin Powell's 5 February 2003 speech to the UN Security council which claimed <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> WMD's Solana contradicted the position of his party leader José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, who opposed the PP government of José María Aznar's support for the invasion of Iraq. Solana is seen, along with González, as representing the older wing of the party. On 15 February 2005 he criticised the Plan Ibarretxe for its position on Basque Country independence, saying that its call for separate Basque representation within the EU had no place within the proposed EU constitution.|$|E
500|$|Following 9/11, [...] Cheney was {{instrumental}} in providing a primary justification for a renewed war against Iraq. Cheney helped shape Bush's approach to the [...] "War on Terror", making numerous public statements alleging Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, and making several personal visits to CIA headquarters, where he questioned mid-level agency analysts on their conclusions. Cheney continued to allege links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, even though President Bush received a classified President's Daily Brief on September 21, 2001, indicating the U.S. intelligence community had no evidence linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks and that [...] "there was scant credible evidence <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> any significant collaborative ties with Al Qaeda".

Claims later leaked in May 2003 that the dossier was [...] "sexed up" [...] under pressure from Downing Street will lead to a media furore, and the apparent suicide of weapons inspector David Kelly.|$|R
2500|$|In 2002, Plame wrote {{a memo to}} her {{superiors}} {{in which}} she expressed hesitation in recommending her husband, former diplomat Joseph C. Wilson, to the CIA for a mission to Niger to investigate claims <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> arranged to purchase and import uranium from the country, but stated that he [...] "may {{be in a position}} to assist". After President George W. Bush stated that [...] "Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa" [...] during the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Wilson published a July 2003 op-ed in The New York Times stating his doubts during the mission that any such transaction with Iraq had taken place.|$|E
2500|$|Saddam {{routinely}} cited {{his survival}} as [...] "proof" [...] <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> in fact {{won the war}} against the U.S. This message earned Saddam a great deal of popularity in many sectors of the Arab world.

That they rallied not so much to Saddam Hussein as to the bipolar nature of the confrontation (the West versus the Arab Muslim world) and the issues that Saddam proclaimed: Arab unity, self-sufficiency, and social justice." [...] As a result, Saddam Hussein appealed to many people for the same reasons that attracted more and more followers to Islamic revivalism and also for the same reasons that fueled anti-Western feelings.|$|E

The former Prime Minister of Niger, Ibrahim Hassane Mayaki, reported to Wilson that he was unaware of any contracts for uranium sales to rogue states, though he was approached by a businessman on behalf of an Iraqi delegation about [...] "expanding commercial relations" [...] with Iraq, which Mayaki interpreted to mean uranium sales. Wilson ultimately concluded that there [...] "was nothing to the story", and reported his findings in March 2002.|$|E
