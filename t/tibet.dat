5|$|Nathu La {{played a}} vital role in the 1903–1904 British {{expedition}} to <b>Tibet,</b> which sought to prevent the Russian Empire from interfering in Tibetan affairs and thus gaining a foothold in the region. In 1904, Major Francis Younghusband, serving as the British Commissioner to <b>Tibet,</b> led a successful mission through Nathu La to capture Lhasa. This led to the setting up of trading posts at Gyantse and Gartok in <b>Tibet,</b> and gave control of the surrounding Chumbi Valley to the British. The following November, China and Great Britain ratified an agreement approving trade between Sikkim and <b>Tibet.</b>|$|E

25|$|Cosmic prelude and <b>Tibet's</b> early history: One motif {{explains}} {{how the world}} collapsed into anarchy: numerous demon kings (Tib.:bdud) had avoided subjection. As a result, hordes of cannibalistic demons and goblins, led by malignant and greedy rulers of many kingdoms, wreak havoc. <b>Tibet's</b> conversion from barbarity to Buddhism under the three great Dharma Rajas often features.

2500|$|The Fifth Dalai Lama {{formally}} institutionalized the Tibetan state oracle of Nechung. [...] Lobsang Gyatso established Nechung Monastery as {{the seat}} of <b>Tibet's</b> state oracle by instituting Gyalpo Pehar as the protector of <b>Tibet's</b> newly consolidated Ganden Phodrang government. [...] Nechung – which, translated literally, means [...] "small place" [...] – was a shrine dedicated to Pehar, located about ten minutes east on foot from Drepung monastery near <b>Tibet's</b> newly declared capital city of Lhasa.|$|R
5|$|<b>Tibet</b> {{was once}} a strong power {{contemporaneous}} with Tang China (618–907). Until the Tibetan Empire's collapse in the 9th century, it was the Tang's major rival in dominating Inner Asia. The Yarlung rulers of <b>Tibet</b> also signed various peace treaties with the Tang, culminating in a treaty in 821 that fixed the borders between <b>Tibet</b> and China.|$|E
5|$|Buddhism {{was adopted}} as the {{official}} religion of <b>Tibet</b> by king Songtsän Gampo (died 649) {{at a time when}} the rise of Hinduism was sweeping away Buddhism in India, the land of its birth. Over the next two centuries Buddhism became established in <b>Tibet,</b> now the center of the religion.|$|E

50|$|However, the British were {{loath to}} create a too {{powerful}} Tibetan army, because of <b>Tibet's</b> irredentistic claims on British Indian territory.

5|$|During production, Hergé kept {{abreast of}} the {{turbulent}} political developments in <b>Tibet.</b> In March 1959, Tibet's foremost political and spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, fled the region into self-imposed exile in India during the 1959 Tibetan uprising. In May 2001, when Tintin in <b>Tibet</b> was published in China, state authorities renamed it Tintin in Chinese <b>Tibet.</b> When Casterman and the Hergé Foundation protested, the authorities restored the book's original title.|$|E
5|$|Following Indian {{independence}} in 1947, Kalimpong {{became part of}} the state of West Bengal, after Bengal was partitioned between India and East Pakistan. With China's annexation of <b>Tibet</b> in 1959, many Buddhist monks fled <b>Tibet</b> and established monasteries in Kalimpong. These monks brought many rare Buddhist scriptures with them. In 1962, the permanent closure of the Jelep Pass after the Sino-Indian War disrupted trade between <b>Tibet</b> and India, and led to a slowdown in Kalimpong's economy. In 1976, the visiting Dalai Lama consecrated the Zang Dhok Palri Phodang monastery, which houses many of the scriptures.|$|E

5|$|In 1358, the Sakya viceregal regime {{installed}} by the Mongols in <b>Tibet</b> was overthrown in a rebellion by the Phagmodru myriarch Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen (1302–1364).

5|$|In 1368, a Han Chinese revolt {{known as}} the Red Turban Rebellion toppled the Mongol Yuan dynasty in China.

It {{is not clear how}} much the early Ming court understood the civil war going on in <b>Tibet</b> between rival religious sects, but the first emperor was anxious to avoid the same trouble that <b>Tibet</b> had caused for the Tang dynasty. Instead of recognizing the Phagmodru ruler, the Hongwu Emperor sided with the Karmapa of the nearer Kham region and southeastern <b>Tibet,</b> sending envoys out in the winter of 1372–1373 to ask the Yuan officeholders to renew their titles for the new Ming court.|$|E

The Tsangpo Valley sightings may be anomalous, only indicating winter visitation. The bird observed in Dzeng was in an environment alien to the species' normal coniferous forest environs, and both the Dzeng and Tse individuals had atypically pale underparts, indicating they may have been nominate S. leucopsis, but with genetic introgression traits from Przevalski's nuthatch.|$|E
