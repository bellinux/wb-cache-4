5|$|The series {{begins as}} Ned Stark {{is asked to}} become the chief advisor (known as the Hand of the King) to lecherous King Robert Baratheon. Ned and his wife Catelyn receive a letter from Catelyn's sister Lysa <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> {{reason to believe that}} rival House Lannister – to which the King's wife Cersei belongs – was the cause of the {{previous}} Hand's death. Ned must travel south to help the king and find out who killed the previous Hand of the King, Jon Arryn, while trying to protect his family from the Lannisters. As he tries to uncover the reasons behind Jon Arryn's death he uncovers the dark secrets about the Lannisters that Arryn himself died trying to expose.|$|E

Pycnoporellus alboluteus has a monomitic hyphal system, meaning {{it is made}} of {{generative}} hyphae, which are thin-walled, branched, and narrow. Hyphae in the flesh layer are thin- to thick-walled, frequently branched, and measure 2–10µm in diameter, while those of the pores are roughly similar in morphology, but measure 3–5µm. Both forms have a thin incrustation on their walls <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> a rough appearance when viewed with a light microscope. The hymenium (spore-bearing tissue layer) is 40–60µm thick, and has abundant cystidia, which are hyaline, and measure 7–9µm in diameter. They are cylindrical, thin-walled to moderately thick-walled, hyaline, have a septum at the base, and measure 60–120 by 5–10µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and have dimensions of 25–35 by 6–7µm.|$|E

5000|$|Psychological egoism {{has been}} accused of being circular: [...] "If a person willingly {{performs}} an act, that means he derives personal enjoyment from it; therefore, people only perform acts <b>that</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> personal enjoyment." [...] In particular, seemingly altruistic acts must be performed because people derive enjoyment from them and are therefore, in reality, egoistic. This statement is circular because its conclusion is identical to its hypothesis: it assumes that people only perform acts <b>that</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> personal enjoyment, and concludes that people only perform acts <b>that</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> personal enjoyment. This objection was tendered by William Hazlitt and Thomas Macaulay in the 19th century, and has been restated many times since. An earlier version of the same objection was made by Joseph Butler in 1726.|$|R

25|$|The Inverted Terminal Repeat (ITR) {{sequences}} comprise 145 bases each.

The feature of these sequences <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> this property is their ability to form a hairpin, which contributes to so-called self-priming that allows primase-independent synthesis of the second DNA strand. The ITRs were also shown to be required for both integration of the AAV DNA into the host cell genome (19th chromosome in humans) and rescue from it, {{as well as for}} efficient encapsidation of the AAV DNA combined with generation of a fully assembled, deoxyribonuclease-resistant AAV particles.|$|E

Proposition 2 grew into the most expensive animal welfare ballot measure ever, with both sides raising nearly $8 million each. The measure passed with 63.2 percent of the vote.|$|E

Ava had been abducted months earlier, but claims to have no knowledge of her whereabouts during the time gap. Lily tries to leave the town, but is killed by an Acheri demon, prompting the others to seek refuge in a building, protecting themselves from the demon with barriers of salt.

500|$|Hill {{has been}} {{credited}} with bringing many women into rock climbing. The 1980s saw a large influx of women into the sport, in part because more women were visible in it {{and in part because}} Title IX funding mandated equal access for boys and girls to athletic programs in public schools. In answer to a question about her position as a role model for women climbers, Hill responded that she felt [...] "responsible to communicate something that touches people, that inspires them, <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> a sense of passion". Climber John Long explains that Hill [...] "was a prodigy and everyone knew as much... Twenty years ago, no female had ever climbed remotely as well as the best guys, so when Lynn began dusting us off—which she did with maddening frequency—folks offered up all kinds of fatuous explanations. Some diehards refused to believe a woman, and a five-foot article at that, could possibly be so good. Out at Josh, it was said Lynn shone owing to quartz monzonite's superior friction, which catered to her bantam weight. In Yosemite, her success apparently hinged on midget hands, which fit wonderfully into the infernal thin cracks. On limestone, she could plug three fingers into pockets where the rest of us managed two. In the desert Southwest, she enjoyed an alliance with coyotes—or maybe shape-shifters. Even after a heap of World Cup victories, it still took the climbing world an age to accept Lynn as the Chosen One, and perhaps her legacy was never established, once and for all, till she free climbed the Nose." ...|$|E

This hindbrain is being removed and replaced with the translation sphere by the humans to make them subservient, and the Doctor rebukes Halpen for lobotomising the Ood. The Doctor and Donna are captured by Ood Operations' security force. Shortly after, the Ood begin a mass revolution and the complex is evacuated, but everyone from the complex, including Solana, are slaughtered en masse. The Doctor and Donna escape with some help from the Ood (after convincing them to resist their brainwashing) and follow Halpen to a locked warehouse that contains a large brain, which is revealed to be the Ood's collective consciousness. The brain's control of the Ood is limited by a circle of pylons emitting a forcefield. Halpen plans to kill the brain and by extension all of the Ood, but is stopped by the Doctor, Donna, and Dr. Ryder. Dr. Ryder reveals that he is secretly an activist for [...] "Friends of the Ood", and had slowly infiltrated the company {{to gain access to the}} pylons and lower their force field to cause the revolution. Halpen is outraged at his betrayal, so he throws Dr. Ryder into the brain, killing him. Halpen's personal Ood servant, Ood Sigma, has been using Halpen's hair loss medication to slowly convert Halpen into an Ood. Ood Sigma tells the Doctor and Donna that he will take care of Halpen.|$|E
