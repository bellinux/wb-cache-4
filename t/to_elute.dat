25|$|One of the {{applications}} of imidazole {{is in the}} purification of His-tagged proteins in immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Imidazole is used <b>to</b> <b>elute</b> tagged proteins bound to nickel ions attached {{to the surface of}} beads in the chromatography column. An excess of imidazole is passed through the column, which displaces the His-tag from nickel coordination, freeing the His-tagged proteins.|$|E
25|$|HIC {{media is}} amphiphilic, with both {{hydrophobic}} and hydrophilic regions, allowing {{for separation of}} proteins based on their surface hydrophobicity. In pure water, the interactions between the resin and the hydrophobic regions of protein would be very weak, but this interaction is enhanced by applying a protein sample to HIC resin in high ionic strength buffer.

25|$|Reversed-phase {{chromatography}} (RPC) is any {{liquid chromatography}} procedure {{in which the}} mobile phase is significantly more polar than the stationary phase. It is so named because in normal-phase liquid chromatography, the mobile phase is significantly less polar than the stationary phase. Hydrophobic molecules in the mobile phase tend to adsorb to the relatively hydrophobic stationary phase. Hydrophilic molecules in the mobile phase will tend <b>to</b> <b>elute</b> first. Separating columns typically comprise a C8 or C18 carbon-chain bonded to a silica particle substrate.|$|E

25|$|An {{early success}} in the {{recycling}} of plastics is Vinyloop, an industrial process to separate PVC from other materials through dissolution, filtration and separation of contaminants. A solvent is used in a closed loop <b>to</b> <b>elute</b> PVC from the waste. This {{makes it possible to}} recycle composite PVC waste, which is normally incinerated or put in a landfill. Vinyloop-based recycled PVC's primary energy demand is 46 percent lower than conventionally produced PVC. The global warming potential is 39 percent lower. This is why the use of recycled material leads to a significantly better ecological outcome. This process was used after the Olympic Games in London 2012. Parts of temporary Buildings like the Water Polo Arena and the Royal Artillery Barracks were recycled. In this way, the PVC Policy could be fulfilled, which says that no PVC waste should be left after the games had ended.|$|E

Beta-induced fluorescence (BIF) is the luminescence excited from a compound {{as a result of}} the passage of beta-particle radiation through a compound or dilute solution of a compound. A liquid chromatographic detector, based on the principle of BIF, has been developed which allowed the detection and quantitation of fluorescent materials. A number of flow cells, incorporating,a promethium- 147 beta particle emitter, were designed and developed with the objective of attaining maximum sensitivity from the detection technique. The response of, the detector <b>to</b> <b>eluted</b> materials, the linearity of the detector response with sample loading and the sensitivity of the detector were examined in normal and reversed phase liquid chromatography. During the development of the BIF detector it became evident that the compounds detected need not be inherently fluorescent. The range of compounds detected could be increased to include those which quench the beta-induced fluorescent emission from the mobile phase. The technique of quenched beta-induced fluorescence was investigated as a detection technique and the response, linearity of response and sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>eluted</b> materials examined. Cerenkov photons are generated whenever a charged particle, travelling at a velocity greater than the velocity of light in the medium, passes through a transparent medium. Cerenkov photons are emitted from the medium as a continuum of wavelength range between 180 nm and 600 nm. The principle of absorption of Cerenkov photons was investigated as a detection technique in liquid chromatography.

2500|$|The {{mobile phase}} {{composition}} {{does not have}} to remain constant. A separation in which the mobile phase composition is changed during the separation process is described as a gradient elution.

The two components of the mobile phase are typically termed [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B"; A is the [...] "weak" [...] solvent which allows the solute <b>to</b> <b>elute</b> only slowly, while B is the [...] "strong" [...] solvent which rapidly elutes the solutes from the column.

2500|$|Biotin {{is widely}} used {{throughout}} the biotechnology industry to conjugate proteins for biochemical assays. Biotin's small size means the biological activity of the protein {{will most likely be}} unaffected. This process is called biotinylation. Because both streptavidin and avidin bind biotin with high affinity (Kd of [...] 10−14mol/l to 10−15mol/l) and specificity, biotinylated proteins of interest can be isolated from a sample by exploiting this highly stable interaction. [...] The sample is incubated with streptavidin/avidin beads, allowing capture of the biotinylated protein of interest. [...] Any other proteins binding to the biotinylated molecule will also stay with the bead and all other unbound proteins can be washed away. [...] However, due to the extremely strong streptavidin-biotin interaction, very harsh conditions are needed <b>to</b> <b>elute</b> the biotinylated protein from the beads (typically 6M guanidine HCl at pH1.5), which often will denature the protein of interest. [...] To circumvent this problem, beads conjugated to monomeric avidin can be used, which has a decreased biotin-binding affinity of ~10−8mol/l, allowing the biotinylated protein of interest to be eluted with excess free biotin.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{identification}} and characterization of a viral intermediate formed during infection of Drosophila cells with the nodavirus Flock House virus (FHV). We observed that even at a very low multiplicity of infection, only 70 % of the input virus stayed attached to or entered the cells, while the remaining 30 % of the virus eluted from cells after initial binding. The eluted FHV particles did not rebind to Drosophila cells and, thus, could no longer initiate infection by the receptor-mediated entry pathway. FHV virus-like particles with the same capsid composition as native FHV but containing cellular RNA also exhibited formation of eluted particles when incubated with the cells. A maturation cleavage-defective mutant of FHV, however, did not. Compared to naïve FHV particles, i. e., particles {{that had never been}} incubated with cells, eluted particles showed an acid-sensitive phenotype and morphological alterations.

30|$|The elution {{property}} of separation medium {{is a key}} issue in liquid purification for the pharmaceutical industry. Elution from porous supports bearing lipid membranes of N-octadecylchitosan was evaluated by measuring the total organic carbon content in an eluent from a column packed with 20  mL of supports. The total organic carbon in the recovered water described in the experimental section was 400  μg L- 1 [10]. Even assuming {{that all of the}} organic carbons are due <b>to</b> <b>eluted</b> N-octadecylchitosan, the eluted N-octadecylchitosan (C, 65.7 %) is calculated as 3.0 [*]×[*] 10 - 5  g. This amount is 0.038 % of the N-octadecylchitosan immobilized on the 20 -mL supports. This stability for alkali is attributable to the stability of the amide linkage used for the immobilization of N-octadecylchitosan as well as the stability of the support material. Any substantial change was not observed in the IR spectra of the porous supports bearing lipid membranes after immersion in 0.5  M NaOH or 0.1  M HCl overnight at ambient temperature. This chemical stability, especially to 0.5  M NaOH immersion which is used as a standard depyrogenation procedure, is robust enough for a practical application in the pharmaceutical industry.|$|R

Particles of different materials and sizes have been investigated (Co-UFP, TiN, TiO 2, Graphite and Silicon) by applying particle suspensions <b>to</b> <b>eluted</b> TLC plates. Mass spectra and mass chromatograms have been recorded directly from the TLC plates. Strong cationization by sodium and potassium was obtained in the positive ion mode, with [M+Na–NH 3]+ ions being the predominant signals. The TLC–MALDI mass spectra recorded from graphite suspensions showed the lowest background noise and the highest peak intensities from the range of suspension matrices studied. The mass accuracy from graphite films was improved by adding the peptide Phe–Phe to the graphite suspensions. This allowed internal recalibration of the TLC–MALDI mass spectra acquired during a run. One major potential advantage of TLC–MALDI–TOF–MS has been demonstrated in the analysis of chlortetracycline and tetracycline in a mixture of oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, tetracycline and minocycline. Examination of the TLC plate prior to MALDI analysis showed only an unresolved spot for chlortetracycline and tetracycline.
