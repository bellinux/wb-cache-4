The <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> was initially {{thought to be the}} viral envelope glycoprotein gp 120. It appeared only to be the indirect target. The direct <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> {{turned out to be the}} co-receptor CXCR 4 used by T-lymphotropic HIV strains (now referred to as X 4 strains) to enter the cells. Initial (phase I) clinical trials undertaken with AMD 3100, as a prelude to its development as a candidate anti-HIV drug for the treatment of AIDS, showed an unexpected side effect: an increase in the white blood cell counts. Apparently, AMD 3100 specifically increased CD 34 + hematopoietic stem cell counts in the peripheral blood. Stromal derived factor 1 (SDF- 1), through its interaction with CXCR 4, retains the stem cells in the bone marrow (a process referred to as “homing”), and AMD 3100 specifically antagonizes this interaction. AMD 3100 in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) resulted in the collection of more progenitor cells than G-CSF alone. At present, the major indication for clinical use of AMD 3100 (Mozobil) is the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow into the circulating blood for transplantation in patients with hematological malignancies such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or multiple myeloma...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{previously}} by our group and others that a series of four disulfide benzamides with cellular anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity can eject zinc from HIV type 1 nucleocapsid protein (NCp 7) in vitro while analogs without antiviral activity do not. We {{also found that the}} zinc ejection activity correlates with the loss of the ability of NCp 7 to bind to HIV psi RNA in vitro. These observations indicate that the antiviral disulfide benzamides may act at a novel retroviral <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> i. e., the nucleocapsid protein. The present studies examine the relationship among disulfide benzamide structure, in vitro NCp 7 zinc ejection activity, and antiviral activity for a larger series of compounds. All of the antiviral disulfide benzamides were found to eject NCp 7 zinc, while some disulfide benzamides with zinc ejection activity are not antiviral. Utilizing the thiol reagent 5, 5 '-dithiobis(2 -nitrobenzoic acid), it was determined that the o-amido-phenyl disulfides being studied cyclize in aqueous solution to form benzisothiazolones. A series of benzisothiazolones, which are stable in solution in the absence of dithiothreitol, were found to eject NCp 7 zinc at a rate similar to that of their disulfide benzamide analogs and to possess similar antiviral activity. It was also found that the relative rates of HIV inactivation by various disulfide benzamides and benzisothiazolones correlate with their relative kinetic rates of NCp 7 zinc ejection, which is consistent with the nucleocapsid protein being the <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> of these compounds...|$|E

40|$|The bicyclams {{represent}} {{a new class}} of highly potent and selective HIV inhibitors. Time-of-addition experiments have previously shown that these compounds interfere with an early event in the viral replicative cycle. Additional experiments have now been carried out in order to investigate in more detail the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> these promising compounds. As described in this paper, PCR experiments revealed that no viral DNA was formed following viral infection, thus confining the <b>target(s)</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> the bicyclams to an early stage of HIV infection. An assay, using pseudotype virions containing the envelope of HIV- 1 and the genome of a plaque-forming virus (Cocal Virus), pointed to viral entry as the main <b>target</b> <b>of</b> the bicyclams. HIV- 1 strains resistant to two prototype bicyclams, JM 2763 and SID 791 (JM 3100), were raised. Results obtained with SID 791 with respect to syncytium formation induced by SID 791 -sensitive and -resistant HIV- 1 strains and the cross-resistance observed for dextran sulfate, suggest inhibition of binding and/or fusion as a plausible <b>target</b> <b>of</b> SID 791. Additional experiments enabled us to exclude SID 791 and JM 2763 as binding inhibitors and to conclude that bicyclams block the entry of cell-bound virus. Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody recognising the V 3 loop of wild-type gp 120 did not bind to this region in the two bicyclam-resistant strains. Our results point to gp 120 as a possible target for the HIV-inhibitory effects of the bicyclams...|$|R
