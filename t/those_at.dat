Security checks at Eurostar are comparable to <b>those</b> <b>at</b> a small airport and generally much quicker than at London Heathrow.

5|$|Prevention of TB {{involves}} screening <b>those</b> <b>at</b> high risk, {{early detection}} and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. <b>Those</b> <b>at</b> high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB.

Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).|$|E

5|$|After 1964 the Kwajalein {{site was}} no longer {{required}} to be on alert, and returned primarily to Zeus testing. The system was kept active in a non-alert role between 1964 and 1967, known as Program 505. In 1967 it {{was replaced by a}} Thor based system, Program 437. A total of 12 launches, including <b>those</b> <b>at</b> White Sands, were carried out as part of the 505 program between 1962 and 1966.|$|E

5|$|As the New Kingdom crumbled, the {{building}} of mortuary temples ceased and was never revived. Some rulers of the Third Intermediate Period, such as <b>those</b> <b>at</b> Tanis, were buried within the enclosures of divine temples, thus continuing the close link between temple and tomb.|$|E

5|$|B. verticillata is {{significantly}} threatened {{by at least}} three microorganisms. Several populations have reduced or vanished from dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi), such as <b>those</b> <b>at</b> Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve and Gull Rock National Park. The honey fungus Armillaria luteobubalina has killed plants in Torndirrup National Park, and aerial canker (Zythiostroma) has decimated populations at Waychinicup National Park east of Albany.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the river}} system was tidal {{as far as}} Hackney Wick, several of the mills were tide mills, {{including}} <b>those</b> <b>at</b> Abbey Mills and <b>those</b> <b>at</b> Three Mills, one of which survives. Construction of the New River {{in the seventeenth century}} to supply drinking water to London, with subsequent extraction by waterworks companies, led to a lowering of water levels, and the river was gradually canalised to maintain navigation. Significant changes occurred with the creation of the Lee Navigation in 1767, which resulted {{in the construction of the}} Hackney Cut and the Limehouse Cut, allowing barges to bypass most of the back rivers. A major reconstruction of the rivers took place in the 1930s, authorised by the River Lee (Flood Relief) Act, but by the 1960s, commercial usage of the waterways had largely ceased. Deteriorating infrastructure led to the rivers dwindling to little more than tidal creeks, and they were categorised in 1968 as having no economic or long-term future.|$|E
5|$|Bulk interactions: The Debye {{screening}} length (defined above) {{is short}} {{compared to the}} physical size of the plasma. This criterion means that interactions in {{the bulk of the}} plasma are more important than <b>those</b> <b>at</b> its edges, where boundary effects may take place. When this criterion is satisfied, the plasma is quasineutral.|$|E

5|$|Caerphilly's water defences {{were almost}} {{certainly}} inspired by <b>those</b> <b>at</b> Kenilworth, where a similar set of artificial lakes and dams was created. Gilbert de Clare had fought at {{the siege of}} Kenilworth in 1266 and would have seen these at first hand. Caerphilly's water defences provided particular protection against mining, which could otherwise undermine castle walls during the period, and are considered the most advanced of their kind in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Contraceptive use in {{developing}} countries is estimated to have decreased the number of maternal deaths by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met. These benefits are achieved by {{reducing the number of}} unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in unsafe abortions and by preventing pregnancies in <b>those</b> <b>at</b> high risk.|$|E
