In attempts to prevent major flooding {{in the aftermath of}} Georges, the United States National Guard provided the Gulf Coast with 1.25million sandbags.

The United Methodist Committee on Relief deployed its disaster response team on September29 to the state <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>damages</b> wrought by Georges.

5000|$|With the {{opportunity}} to use either liability or property-based rules to protect entitlements, the academic community soon concluded {{that the key to}} figuring out which rule to use turned on the transaction costs. Therefore, if there were low transaction costs, then property rules should be used. If the transaction costs were high, then liability rules should be used. [...] A. Mitchell Polinsky, Josephine Scott Crocker Professor of Law and Economics at Stanford Law School, argued that transactions costs are not the only impediments to bargaining, there is also the problem of assessment costs. Assessment costs are the costs associated in obtaining and processing information. [...] There is a long understanding in the academic community that when transaction costs are high a liability rule will help substitute for bargaining. Judges, however, may have a difficult time in obtaining and processing information in order <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>damages.</b> There are two ways <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>damages.</b> An objective method uses the market price. The market price, however, can underestimate the truth of the matter. A subjective method of calculation is the alternative. Under the subjective method, the amount of damages is the minimum price the entitlement holder would accept in a bilateral exchange. Unfortunately, the objective method does not capture the correct amount of damages, and the subjective method would be difficult for a judge to implement ...|$|E

5000|$|These {{two terms}} {{are used to}} {{differentiate}} the degree of proof where a vessel or cargo has been lost. An actual total loss occurs where the damages or cost of repair clearly equal or exceed {{the value of the}} property. A constructive total loss is a situation where the cost of repairs plus the cost of salvage equal or exceed the value. The use of these terms is contingent on there being property remaining <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>damages,</b> which is not always possible in losses to ships at sea or in total theft situations. In this respect, marine insurance differs from non-marine insurance, where the insured is required to prove his loss. Traditionally, in law, marine insurance was seen as an insurance of [...] "the adventure", with insurers having a stake and an interest in the vessel and/or the cargo rather than simply an interest in the financial consequences of the subject-matter's survival.|$|E

Between 1301 and 1303 we find him in attendance upon the king in Scotland. In 1302 the king granted him the right of holding two markets weekly and one fair yearly at his manor of Ermington in Devonshire, with other privileges, and in the following year he obtained a similar grant for his manor of Bennington, Hertfordshire. In 1306 he went the northern circuit {{as one of the}} commission of trailbaston. He was appointed justice of the common bench on the accession of Edward II (1307), the king in the same year granting him the right of fortifying his house called Rosemont at Eye, near Westminster, with walls of lime and stone. Next year he attended the king in Scotland, and was also despatched with Roger Savage to Philip of France to arrange a personal interview between the two kings, which took place at Pontoise.|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{previous}} literature relating to auditor liability has focused on individual issues in isolation. This paper aims to integrate the key issues, considering the rationale, cost and implications of the audit liability regime and overviewing the current calculus used <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>damages</b> and reforms suggested to limit liability. It is submitted the current liability regime {{as it applies to}} auditors is too severe, inequitably imposing substantial costs on auditors. Consistent with recent literature, it is argued that a better solution would appear to be the introduction of a proportional liability regime accompanied by a mandatory requirement that directors hold professional liability insurance as well as reform to the calculus used <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>damages...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The goal of {{this study}} was to use LiDAR data <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> trees from a December, 2007 ice storm {{affecting}} the city of Norman, Oklahoma (USA). Pre- and post-storm LiDAR data was collected for the city and it was processed and analyzed in a GIS platform. Results indicate that for single standing trees, LiDAR data can accurately <b>assess</b> and quantify <b>damage</b> with an accuracy of 90 %. However, it is yet to be examined how the accuracy would change if the proposed methodology was applied to grouped trees or with trees with overlapping branches. The proposed method suggests that in the future, LiDAR data would allow foresters and researchers <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> tree <b>damage</b> from not only ice storms, but also other natural disasters...|$|R
