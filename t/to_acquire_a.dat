5|$|Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case {{decided in}} 2001.

5|$|Rootes {{had always}} been insufficiently capitalised, and losses {{resulting}} from a damaging thirteen-week strike at one of its subsidiaries, British & Light Steel Pressings, coupled with the expense of launching the Hillman Imp, meant that by 1964 the company was in serious financial difficulties. At the same time, Chrysler was looking to boost its presence in Europe, and so a deal was struck in June 1964 in which Chrysler paid £12.3 million ($34.44 million) for a large stake in Rootes, although not a controlling one. As part of the agreement Chrysler committed not <b>to</b> <b>acquire</b> <b>a</b> majority of Rootes voting shares without {{the approval of the}} UK government, which was keen not to see any further American ownership of the UK motor industry. In 1967 Minister of Technology Anthony Wedgewood Benn approached BMH and Leyland to see if they would buy out Chrysler and Rootes and keep the company British, but neither had the resources to do so. Later that year Chrysler was allowed <b>to</b> <b>acquire</b> <b>a</b> controlling interest in Rootes for a further investment of £20 million.|$|E
