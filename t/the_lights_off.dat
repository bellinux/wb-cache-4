People considered him instrumental in cures and other blessings. He loved to kneel before the Eucharist in the quiet of the night; Father Benedict Groeschel once recalled visiting the convent on a warm night and being unable to sleep. Around 3:00am, Groeschel took a walk and arrived at the chapel where he put on two lights and saw Casey kneeling on the top step of the altar. Groeschel observed him for several moments and noted that Casey didn't move – Groeschel simply flicked <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>off</b> to leave Casey to his prayer.|$|E
