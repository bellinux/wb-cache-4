5|$|Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson was one {{of several}} sons of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of Mann and the Isles (died 1237), and thus a member of the Crovan dynasty. Although Óláfr is known to have had two wives, and no {{contemporaneous}} source names the mother of his children, there is evidence suggesting <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> may have been Óláfr's second wife: Cairistíona, daughter of Fearchar mac an tSagairt, Earl of Ross (died c.1251). Specifically, the Chronicle of Mann states that, when Óláfr died in 1237, he was succeeded by his fourteen-year-old son, Haraldr Óláfsson (died 1248). This source therefore dates Haraldr Óláfsson's birth to 1223, about the time when Óláfr and Fearchar allied themselves in marriage. The ancestral origins of Fearchar's family are unknown, although he {{appears to have been a}} native of eastern Ross. The Norse-Gaelic Crovan dynasty, founded by Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's paternal great-great grandfather, held royal power in the Isles from the late eleventh to the mid thirteenth century. Consisting of a region roughly encompassing the Hebrides and Mann, the Isles are named in Old Norse sources as Suðreyjar ("Southern Isles"), and in Gaelic sources as Innsi Gall ("Islands of the Foreigners"). Various documentary sources, in the form of contemporary chronicles and sagas, reveal that during the dynasty's tenure of power, the kings of the Isles tended to acknowledge the authority of the kings of Norway.|$|E
5|$|The series {{revolves}} around the lives of Jaypaw, Lionpaw and Hollypaw, kits of Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight and grandchildren of the ThunderClan leader Firestar. The three slowly {{come to terms with}} their unique paths in life; Lionpaw worries about his thirst for blood on the battlefield, Hollypaw considers {{what it means to be}} truly loyal to her Clan, and Jaypaw is bitter that he was born blind. One day, Jaypaw unintentionally discovers a prophecy that he believes refers to him and his siblings. The three attempt to understand their new destinies, and realize that Lionpaw has the power to never be harmed in battle, whilst Jaypaw can walk in the dreams and read the minds of other cats. Hollypaw, on the other hand, struggles to determine what her unique power is. Hollypaw and Lionpaw are made warriors, becoming Hollyleaf and Lionblaze respectively, whilst Jaypaw becomes a medicine cat and is later given the name Jayfeather. They seek the advice of a mysterious loner named Sol, who promises to give them the answers to their destinies; however, they eventually realize him to be a deceptive liar, and he is banished from the forest. Although uncertain of their powers, the three cats are always secure in the knowledge that they are deeply loved by their parents. This safe haven is shattered when they are forced into a fire by Ashfur, another ThunderClan warrior. Ashfur wishes to murder the three cats in order to punish their mother, Squirrelflight, for rejecting his love years earlier. However, Squirrelflight admits that the three cats are not her offspring, and Ashfur lets them go. The siblings are deeply distressed by this confession, and attempt to discover who their true parents are. They eventually learn <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> is Leafpool, the ThunderClan medicine cat, and their father is Crowfeather, a WindClan warrior. Hollyleaf is devastated by this, and murders Ashfur in revenge. Unsatisfied, she then publicly announces to the rest of the Clans the true story of her heritage. When the Clans do not praise her for her honesty, but rather react with shock and confusion, Hollyleaf runs away into a series of collapsing tunnels. Presuming her to be dead, and numb with grief for their sister, Lionblaze and Jayfeather realize that Hollyleaf never had a power in the first place. They instead turn their eyes to two kits newly born in the Clan, one of whom could fulfill the third role in the prophecy.|$|E

25|$|For decades, the Rosenbergs' sons Michael and Robert Meeropol {{and many}} other {{defenders}} maintained that Julius and Ethel were innocent of spying on their country and victims of Cold War paranoia. After {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union, much information concerning them was declassified, including a trove of decoded Soviet cables, code-named VENONA, which detailed Julius's role as a courier and recruiter for the Soviets and Ethel's role as an accessory. Their sons' current position is that Julius was legally guilty of the conspiracy charge, though not of atomic spying, while Ethel was only generally aware of his activities. The children believe that their father did not deserve the death penalty and <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> was wrongly convicted. They continue to campaign for Ethel to be posthumously and legally exonerated.|$|E

40|$|The word {{discipline}} {{is synonymous with}} an orderly life and it helps children to spend their life as happy and safe. The root of the word comes from “disciplinaire” that means to teach or instruct. Discipline is about teaching children appropriate behavior and helping them become independent and responsible, empathic, self efficient and self controlled people. “Discipline” and “punishment” are generally perceived as the same things. In fact discipline covers all the methods which help to behavior change. It was intended to investigate the frequency of discipline techniques of parents which don’t include violence. The study was realized with 151 students 1. 2. and 3. grade of an elementary school at Bursa. Picture-Card Version of The Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS 33) that was created by Mebert and Straus (2002) {{was used in the}} study. The data was analyzed by means of frequency, percentile and chi square calculations. Reading to children before going to bed was not found to be an uncommon discipline technique (around 10 %). When the children do something wrong 49 % of the girls said <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> explain “frequently” why it is wrong, but 4 o. 7 % of boys declared <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> “never” use this technique. Most of the students (averagely 80 %) reported <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> and fathers send them to a room “sometimes”. It is very important to explain to the parents the alternative discipline techniques. Parent education programs generally implicit that corporal punishment is the most effective discipline technique so parents need to be persuaded for alternative techniques...|$|R
25|$|The 14th prince, Yinti, born to {{the same}} mother as the Yongzheng Emperor, was {{recalled}} to Beijing from his military post. The emperor selected Nian Gengyao to replace Yinti as {{the commander of the}} northwestern expeditionary force. Yinti, who expected to be placed on the throne himself, was reluctant to recognise the Yongzheng Emperor's succession as legitimate. Yinti was accused of violating imperial decorum at the funeral proceedings of the late emperor, and placed under house arrest by the Yongzheng Emperor at the imperial tombs in western Beijing. Historians believe <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother,</b> Empress Dowager Renshou, favoured Yinti partly because she raised him herself, while she did not raise the Yongzheng Emperor. Nonetheless the increasingly sharp conflict between her two surviving sons caused their mother great sorrow. She died less than six months after the Kangxi Emperor.|$|E

25|$|In July 1976, Billy Arjan Singh {{acquired}} a hand-reared tigress named Tara from Twycross Zoo in the United Kingdom, and reintroduced {{her to the}} wild in Dudhwa National Park {{with the permission of}} India's then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In the 1990s, some tigers from this area were observed to have the typical appearance of Siberian tigers, namely a large head, pale fur, white complexion, and wide stripes, and were suspected to be Siberian–Bengal tiger hybrids. Billy Arjan Singh sent hair samples of tigers from the national park to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad where the samples were analysed using mitochondrial sequence analysis. Results revealed that the tigers in question had an Indian tiger mitochondrial haplotype indicating <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> was an Indian tiger. Skin, hair and blood samples from 71 tigers collected in various Indian zoos, in the National Museum in Kolkata and including two samples from Dudhwa National Park were prepared for microsatellite analysis that revealed that two tigers had alleles in two loci contributed by Bengal and Siberian tiger subspecies. However, samples of two hybrid specimens constituted a too small sample base to conclusively assume that Tara was the source of the Siberian tiger genes.|$|E

25|$|Stan later flirts with Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), {{and offers}} her a loan when he learns {{that she is}} {{struggling}} for money. When Nancy Carter (Maddy Hill) suffers an epileptic fit, Stan and Shirley unite to help her and successfully deal with the issue. Wanting to reconcile with Shirley further, Stan calls Dean to The Vic. However, the reunion does not go well and Mick ends up punching Dean when he turns nasty with Shirley. Shirley blames Stan for the situation and threatens to throw him out, but he tells her if she does that he will reveal that it was her, not Shirley's mother Sylvie, that tried to drown Mick when he was very young. When the Carters decide to re-paint the exterior of The Vic, Tina tells Mick that she can remember when they were decorating and when Mick nearly drowned in a bath, and <b>that</b> <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> Sylvie was not present. Mick believes that Stan was the culprit who tried to drown him, and orders him to leave The Vic immediately. Mick later violently grabs him and taunts him with drowning in the bath, although Shirley stops with the truth. Stan helps Linda allow her son, Johnny (Sam Strike), some independence after he reveals he is gay. Stan grows closer to Cora when he holds her a late birthday celebration as everyone forgets the date. He refuses to believe Mick is guilty of soliciting a prostitute when he arrested for the crime, despite his plea in court. Cora reveals the offence to the whole pub, and distances herself from Stan. He is suspicious and realises when speaking to Cora's granddaughter Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) that Cora knows the prostitute involved. Cora apologises to the Carters when her daughter Rainie (Tanya Franks), the prostitute, confesses that she lied about Mick.|$|E
