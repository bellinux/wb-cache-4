25|$|To limit global {{temperature}} to a hypothetical 2 degrees Celsius rise would demand a 75% decline in carbon emissions in industrial countries by 2050, if {{the population is}} 10 billion in 2050. Across 40 years, this averages to a 2% decrease every year. In 2011, the emissions of energy production continued rising regardless of the consensus of the basic problem.

25|$|From {{the end of}} the Great Depression {{until the}} early 1970s, Keynesian {{economics}} provided the main inspiration for economic policy makers in Western industrialized countries. The influence of Keynes's theories waned in the 1970s, due to stagflation and critiques from Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, Robert Lucas, Jr. and other economists, who were less optimistic about the ability of interventionist government policy to positively regulate <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>or</b> otherwise opposed to Keynesian policies. From the early 1980s to 2008, the normative consensus among economists was that attempts at fiscal stimulus would be ineffective even in a recession, and such policies were only occasionally employed by the governments of developed countries.|$|E
500|$|Opinions {{differ on}} {{who was the}} founder of modern {{ecological}} theory. Some mark Haeckel's definition as the beginning; others say it was Eugenius Warming with the writing of [...] (1895), or Carl Linnaeus' principles on the economy of nature that matured in the early 18th century. Linnaeus founded an early branch of ecology that he called the economy of nature. His works influenced Charles Darwin, who adopted Linnaeus' phrase on <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>or</b> polity of nature in The Origin of Species. Linnaeus {{was the first to}} frame the balance of nature as a testable hypothesis. Haeckel, who admired Darwin's work, defined ecology in reference to the economy of nature, which has led some to question whether ecology and the economy of nature are synonymous.|$|E

[...] "Jesus Christ Pose" [...] was written about famous people who exploit the symbol of Jesus' crucifixion as to suggest that they're persecuted by the public. Cornell said that [...] "Outshined" [...] is about going from [...] "periods of extreme self-confidence" [...] to [...] "plummeting in the opposite direction". [...] "Holy Water" [...] was written about people who force their beliefs unto others.

500|$|... "Margaritaville" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker. It first aired on March 25, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone said they had long planned to do an episode about the global recession, and they argued over whether to start the season with an episode about <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> <b>or</b> [...] "The Ring," [...] an episode mocking the Jonas Brothers, a boy band which had recently grown in popularity. Stone argued the season premiere should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener. Stone ultimately agreed, and later admitted it was the right decision. During an interview {{a few weeks before the}} episode aired, Stone said, [...] "That's one of those big things we want to get right. We'll be talking about what kind of social commentary we want to make and do it right." ...|$|E
500|$|Bassist Ben Shepherd {{replaced}} Jason Everman {{and the new}} lineup recorded Soundgarden's {{third album}} in 1991. Cornell said that Shepherd brought a [...] "fresh and creative" [...] approach to the recording sessions, and the band as a whole said that his knowledge of music and writing skills redefined the band. The band released the resulting album, Badmotorfinger, on October 8, 1991. Steve Huey of Allmusic said that the songwriting on Badmotorfinger [...] "takes a quantum leap in focus and consistency". He added, [...] "It's surprisingly cerebral and arty music for a band courting mainstream metal audiences." [...] Thayil suggested that the album's lyrics are [...] "like reading a novel [...] man's conflict with himself and society, or the government, or his family, or <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> <b>or</b> anything". The first single from Badmotorfinger, [...] "Jesus Christ Pose," [...] garnered attention when MTV decided to ban its music video in 1991. The song and its video outraged many listeners who perceived it as anti-Christian. The band received death threats while on tour in the United Kingdom {{in support of the}} album. Cornell explained that the lyrics criticize public figures who use religion (particularly the image of Jesus Christ) to portray themselves as being persecuted. Although eclipsed {{at the time of its}} release by the sudden popularity of Nirvana's Nevermind, the focus of attention brought by Nevermind to the Seattle scene helped Soundgarden gain wider attention. The singles [...] "Outshined" [...] and [...] "Rusty Cage" [...] were able to find an audience on alternative rock radio and MTV. Badmotorfinger was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1992, and was among the 100 top-selling albums of the year.|$|E

2500|$|The reply of TSSI theorists is, basically, {{that the}} concept of {{equilibrium}} itself is confused with (1) the concept of continual (and haphazard) market adjustment, and (2) the concept of socio-economic stability. [...] Supply and demand may continually adjust to each other without ever being in equilibrium, other than momentary coincidences, and the lack of a perfect match between supply and demand does not necessarily prevent social stability, as long as enough workers turn up for work each working day to produce more capital. Capitalist equilibrium means [...] "business as usual" [...] for capitalists, and [...] "back to work" [...] for workers. But [...] "business as usual" [...] does not mean market balance. Disequilibrium is precisely the life of the market, and equilibrium is the life that the market observably never had. Marx himself had never argued that capitalist society is [...] "held together" [...] or [...] "balanced out" [...] by the market; instead, what held society together was the relations of production, i.e. the mutual dependencies arising out of the necessity to produce and reproduce human life co-operatively, within the framework of a system of property rights enforced by the state. Thus, a consistent Marxian theory of prices and profits is claimed to be possible, without assuming that the market, <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>or</b> the society spontaneously gravitate to an [...] "equilibrium state" [...] of economic harmony through the [...] "price mechanism". In this view, the idea of equilibrium is itself poorly conceptualized by economists, and given a magical, arcane power which it does not really have, once we understand the conjuror's trick.|$|E
30|$|Theorem  2 is {{our main}} result in this paper. It generalizes Theorem  3 in [9] by {{considering}} the fuzzy framework. We emphasize that our arguments {{to the existence of}} fuzzy equilibrium are different from the approaches used in literature, since the modeling of the private information and the countable space of actions assumes a new setting. The proof relies in particular on the Kuratowski-Ryll-Nardzewski selection theorem and on the Fan fixed point theorem. The possible applications of this result may concern the aspects of <b>the</b> <b>economies</b> <b>or</b> markets in which countable aspects matter.|$|R

Nevertheless, the model is ineffective for the two NIEs, which underwent structural economic shifts to slower growth during our sample period of 1970 - 1998. Second, the two-period Markov-switching by dividing the sample periods into two sub-periods thus more effectively measures the two NIEs' business cycles. ...|$|R
