5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of {{controversy}} surrounding the cover art {{used for this}} album. Sepultura had initially planned on using another Michael Whelan cover art, Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre. Monte Conner of Roadrunner sent the original artwork to Obituary, who used it on their album, Cause of Death. For years after the incident, Igor Cavalera was upset with Monte Conner for giving away their album cover. The artwork for Arise, however, was designed by Michael Whelan exclusively for the album.|$|E

Shortly thereafter however, NBC would gain the broadcast television rights to the National Basketball Association (NBA) from CBS, thus <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a notion that NBC no longer really needed hockey.|$|E

While <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of {{competition for the}} Indian middle order, Pankaj Roy was coming {{to the end of}} his career as an opener. In that position, Jaisimha scored Test hundreds against England in 1961–62 and 1963–64, and 134 against Ceylon in 1964–65. In the 1963–64 series against England he made 444 runs. In 1964–65, he batted in the middle order for Hyderabad and hit 713 runs. But failures in the Test matches led to him being dropped.|$|E

500|$|Phips sailed {{from the}} Downs on 12 September 1686, and on 28 November arrived in Hispaniola, Samana Bay, where they {{spent two weeks}} {{restocking}} their water and provender. The weather was bad, and the search consequently did not get under way {{for a few more}} weeks. January 12, Phips sent out Captain Rogers in the smaller Henry of London along with three Native American divers (Jonas Abimeleck and John Pasqua, name of other diver not listed) to search what was then called the Ambrosia Bank (now the Silver Bank). <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more delay from weather but Peter Earle writes, [...] "There is no doubt that he knew exactly where he was going." [...] January 20, they spotted cannons from a shipwreck lying on the white sands of the reef. The ship they had found was the Almiranta of the Spanish silver fleet (later determined to be Nuestra Señora de la Concepción; the English did not know the name of the ship) wrecked in 1641. Over the next two days, the divers were able to bring up 3,000 coins and 3 silver bars. They decided to travel back to Phips' to let him know but {{this turned out to be}} a somewhat slow and treacherous trip among the reefs.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{this episode}} were {{generally}} positive. Common Sense Media gave the episode {{three out of}} five stars, calling it a [...] "ribald but often hilarious satire of fantasy favorite". Brad Trechak of TV Squad also praised [...] "Blue Harvest", stating that it [...] "was a fun episode to watch"; he thought that [...] "MacFarlane kept to the story pretty well, and there were enough corny jokes to make it amusing". Ahsan Haque from IGN gave it a score of seven out of ten, criticizing the selection of Herbert as Obi-Wan, but did say that the other choices were [...] "spot-on"; he ended his review by stating, [...] "as a tribute to Star Wars, this episode succeeds, but you can't help but wish that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more to it, considering {{the nature of the}} source material". In a later review of the season as a whole, Haque said that the episode was [...] "generally entertaining, but certainly wasn't as great as it could have been". Daniel Fienberg of Zap2it also gave it a positive review although he stated that it was released soon after Robot Chickens Star Wars special and it fared worse because of it. Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number three on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "pretty much the same [...] but better." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore, {{the third}} actor to play Bond in the films, said that Craig was a [...] "damn good Bond {{but the film}} as a whole, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too much flash cutting [...] {{it was just like}} a {{commercial}} of the action. There didn't seem to be any geography and you were wondering what the hell was going on." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave it 4/5, remarking it was not [...] "bigger and better than Casino Royale, [...] perhaps a smart move in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond's mission has barely begun." [...] However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films. The Sunday Times review noted that [...] "following Casino Royale {{was never going to be}} easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand's successful relaunch crashing back to earth – with a yawn"; the screenplay [...] "is at times incomprehensible" [...] and the casting [...] "is a mess." [...] The review concludes that [...] "Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism." [...] The Guardian gave a more positive review, rating it as 3/5 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he [...] "made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage" [...] and calling the film [...] "a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement"; it concludes [...] "Quantum of Solace isn't as good as Casino Royale: the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up." ...|$|E

2500|$|What has happened? Can a man {{who sets}} records for wicket-taking in his first series be reduced to bowling to a wicketkeeper unaccompanied by slips, gullies or short legs? How can Hogg get no wicket for a hundred-odd in a Test? There is no single answer. But the major factor was the pitch. It got lower, slower and deader as the match progressed... <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of bad luck... Hogg was not slacking.

2500|$|On 31 August 1987 The Stems played {{what turned}} out to be their last gig. In October of that year, a {{proposed}} six-week European tour was cancelled and the group disbanded. McFarlane wrote; [...] "by that time they had developed into one of the best live bands on the Australian scene". In October 2009 Mariani told The Ages Michael Dwyer, [...] "we were on the charts, getting airplay, very popular. But within the band <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of burnout ... you have these moments where you can't stop thinking negatively and I kept picturing myself pushing a van in the snow. I thought, 'I don't want to be doing that. I'm getting out of here'". The Huffington Posts Holly Cara Price described the group as [...] "one of the most tuneful and tasty garage rock bands of the era. Avid fans of pop, R and 60's garage punk, their predilection translated to great punchy songs".|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Dravid was {{a picture}} of calm and patience, as he played yet another {{important}} innings to turn around India's fortunes. His 92 however, lacked in the polish that was exhibited in his two knocks in Adelaide, as he played and missed sometimes. But he retained an excellent control over almost all bowlers, and played a lot of dot balls, and put away the bad deliveries for the boundaries, explaining his high boundary rate. Dravid was dismissed by Lee, edging a delivery to Adam Gilchrist behind the stumps. Dravid was dismissed when the score was 253, and was the fifth man out. After his dismissal for a gritty 92, the Indian innings came to an end rather rapidly, as only a further 33 runs were added for the loss of five wickets, including that of Ganguly's who was dismissed for 73. Brad Williams {{turned out to be the}} chief destroyer of the Indian innings with a haul of 4 wickets, and constantly troubled Ganguly. Williams, who was a surprise pick over Andy Bichel, expressed his joy on being able to scalp four against the Indian batting order. He also praised Dravid for his batting. Dravid himself commented that it had been an uphill struggle for most of the day, [...] "It was never comfortable. When me and Sourav were going well, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of hope. But to be honest, we needed something special to happen, an Eden Gardens or an Adelaide. And those things don't happen everyday.". India's spectacular collapse left Australia needing only 95 runs for a victory.|$|E
