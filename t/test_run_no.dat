40|$|Graduation date: 2006 A sawmill {{is similar}} to other {{manufacturing}} enterprises {{when it comes to}} making decisions, scheduling production and meeting customer demands. In order to help sawmills achieve their goals, and because there is such a high degree of variability in the raw material used in this industry, computer simulation has proven to be a very valuable tool to help improve productivity and processing efficiency. Raw material variability is expected to be an increasing issue in coming years due to an increase in small-diameter timber on the market resulting from the thinning of overstocked forest stands. These changes are expected to result in a significant decrease in production for mills that are not equipped to process this type of material. As a means of analyzing the influence of these changes, this thesis details the development and use of a discrete-event computer simulation model of the Warm Springs Forest Products Industries sawmill in Warm Springs, OR. This research is part of a larger project in which other improvement scenarios were studied (Salichon 2005). The simulation model was first used to identify some possible areas of improvement and to optimize the current overall process and production of the sawmill while operating with its current log distribution. The study identified a number of opportunities for improvement. It was demonstrated that increasing the unscrambler maximum capacity up to 800 boards resulted in an increase in piece count production ranging from 2. 6 to 5. 3 %. The influence of machines downtimes as well as the influence of having a second operator assisting at the horizontal resaw were also investigated. Past studies have shown that log sorting is an essential condition to achieve high production in a sawmill. The simulation model was used to evaluate sorting strategies that would minimize the decrease in production resulting from introducing small-diameter timber (5 to 7 inches) into the log supply. Different small-diameter distributions were tried and different sorting solutions were tested for each of the log distributions. It was shown that the mill would suffer a decrease in piece count production ranging from 10. 1 to 13. 1 % if their current two decks sort is retained. However, it was demonstrated that implementing a three decks sort would considerably reduce this drop in production to only 4. 7 to 6. 4 %. Simulation has been shown to be a very valuable tool that sawmills can use to investigate production and other log supply issues. While piece count production was sufficient for analyzing current mill efficiency changes, the introduction of smaller diameter logs will also reduce the board feet per piece ratio. Due to the loss of the trimmer data during the <b>test</b> <b>run,</b> <b>no</b> information can be provided about board footage and thus the results and statistics in this research were based on piece count only. However, future work could be done with log breakdown models like BOF or SAW 3 D to determine board footage. Future research could also focus on studying the influence of the trimmer's downtimes on the unscrambler queue and other machine utilization rates as well as testing mathematical algorithms that will search for other optimized sorting and feeding strategies...|$|E

5000|$|The Finnish VR Class Pr2, nicknamed [...] "Henschel", was a {{passenger}} tank class ordered from the Henschel & Son locomotive workshops by the Estonia State Railways {{in the spring}} 1939 and completed in 1941. The outbreak of the Second World War prevented their delivery to Estonia, but {{at least a few}} of these engines did manage to operate in Latvia in 1942. These engines became superfluous, because the Germans were converting the Baltic tracks to standard gauge, and so Finland could purchase these four engines. They were classified Pr2 and numbered 1800-1803 after their arrival in December 1942. The Pr2 tank engines were quite advanced locomotives, based on the Henschel Class 62 tank engine design of 1928. After their initial problems were solved, they proved to be fast runners and an ideal addition to the motive power roster. They were originally built by as oil-burners, and reverted to this type of fuel between 1947 and 1954 when oil prices were low. The Pr2 was very fast with its 1,830 mm wheel diameter.

30|$|From Fig.  6, we {{can also}} draw the {{following}} three conclusions: (1) PkuAS running with ACs can get a better system performance than the “pure” PkuAS when under heavy workloads (e.g., when txRate is above  6). This is because ACs such as TPA take effects to enable PkuAS do self-management for handling extreme cases. (2) PkuAS running with ACs and RSpring together can get an even better system performance when under heavy workloads. Using the “txRate= 10 ” test for example, the response time of PkuAS running with RSpring is 6.9 (corresponding to the “RSpring (using CLAT)” curve). This value is about 47  % of the response time measured in the “pure” PkuAS test, and is 83  % of the time measured in the “ACs <b>Run</b> (<b>no</b> RSpring)” <b>test.</b> Such a performance improvement {{is due to the}} dynamic degrading and upgrading of the autonomic levels of the ACs, which is done automatically by RSpring. (3) The test results of RSpring with different tuning algorithms are close to each other. We cannot tell which one is always better than others, but we can tell that they all bring better results than the <b>tests</b> of “ACs <b>Run</b> (<b>no</b> RSpring).” The reason behind is that all the algorithms reflect the same tuning mechanism: enable a flexible tradeoff between business functions and ACs by executing the latter dynamically when resources are limited and competed.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{shows the}} results {{obtained}} by drying 38 -mm thick beech timber, namely one control <b>test</b> <b>run</b> under usual, conventional drying schedule and four <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> dried under the same schedule but with oscillations of equilibrium moisture content. During oscillation drying, temperature curve was identical with the temperature curve in the control <b>test</b> <b>run,</b> and the values of equilibrium moisture content oscillated according to previously set amplitudes and frequencies. Oscillation amplitudes were ± 10 % {{in the first two}} <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> and ± 20 % in the second two <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> compared to the value anticipated in the schedule. Duration of each oscillation was 3 h in the first and third <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> and 6 h in the second and fourth <b>test</b> <b>runs.</b> Special addition to the manufacturer’s software was developed for the realization of these oscillations. When comparing the results, drying time (for the same intervals of initial and final timber moisture content), energy consumption and drying quality were taken into consideration. Drying quality was determined {{at the end of each}} <b>test</b> <b>run</b> (both before and after conditioning), and based on the value of final timber moisture content, distribution of moisture content across thickness and gap size. Drying time was shorter in all four <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> with oscillations, and energy consumption was lower than in the conventional <b>test</b> <b>run.</b> Slightly shorter drying period was recorded in <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> with oscillation frequency of 3 hours compared to the <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> with 6 hour oscillations.
