5|$|In October 2013, during <b>the</b> <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} {{season of}} the show, executive producer Al Jean revealed that a character would die in this episode. In July 2014, on {{the announcement of the}} title of the episode, several media outlets incorrectly presumed that Krusty would die. The choice of character to die was deemed by some critics as anti-climactic due to Rabbi Krustofski's minor role in the show, although other reviewers praised its conclusion to the relationship between Krusty and his father.|$|E

In 2008, stories about his sex life appeared in the British press, along with unfounded allegations regarding Nazi connotations. Mosley successfully sued the newspaper that published the allegations and maintained his position as FIA president. He stood {{down at the end of}} his term in 2009 and was replaced by his preferred successor, Jean Todt.|$|E

The movement encourages Chinese citizens to renounce their affiliations to the Chinese Communist Party, including ex post facto renunciations of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers. Practitioners of Falun Gong outside China make phone calls or faxes to mainland China to inform citizens of the movement and solicit renunciation statements.|$|E

5|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. However, it achieved moderate commercial success because its sound was aimed {{more at the}} underground rave scene audience, and failed to enter the Billboard 200. It is currently out of print.

5|$|Girlschool {{embarked}} {{in a long}} US tour {{to promote}} the album, sometimes as support to Quiet Riot and Blue Öyster Cult, but more often as headliner in small venues after uncomfortable travels. Johnson, unable to tolerate the unhealthy life on the road, quit the band before completing the US tour, hurting <b>the</b> <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album in America. She went to live in Los Angeles with Vicki Blue, former bassist of The Runaways. With the departure of Kelly Johnson, who was often considered the visual and musical {{focal point of the}} band, the almost bankrupt Bronze Records failed to extend the band's recording contract for a follow-up album.|$|E
5|$|The 1923 West Indies touring team played 21 {{first-class}} {{matches in}} England, of which six were won, seven lost {{and the others}} drawn. The team's relative success, and particularly the performance of leading batsman George Challenor, persuaded English critics that West Indies cricket was stronger than previously supposed; this was instrumental in <b>the</b> <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team to Test match status in 1928. Challenor was the biggest individual success of the tour, but Constantine impressed English critics, through his style of play more than his statistical achievements. He played 20 first-class matches on the tour, scoring 425 runs {{at an average of}} 15.74 and taking 37 wickets at an average of 21.86. Against Oxford University, he scored 77, his maiden first-class fifty; his only other half century came against Derbyshire. He also took five wickets in an innings for the first time, in the match against Kent.|$|E

By June 2008 Island stopped promoting Discipline. The singer expressed open dissatisfaction with <b>the</b> <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album, explaining {{that there would be}} no further single releases. The album failed in the UK charts, remaining just one week in position 63 with 3,914 copies sold. but did manage to chart in the Top 5 of the UK R Album Chart. In France, Discipline debuted at number forty-three with just 3,000 copies sold. In Japan the album debuted higher, at number nine with 19,839 copies sold.

5|$|There {{were also}} issues with <b>the</b> <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film: promotional {{material}} {{in the form of}} teaser posters created by Bob Peak, based on the Licence Revoked title and commissioned by Albert Broccoli, had been produced, but MGM decided against using them after American test screenings showed 'Licence Revoked' to be a common American phrase for the withdrawal of a driving licence. The delayed, corrected advertising by Steven Chorney, in the traditional style, limited the film's pre-release screenings. MGM also discarded a campaign created by advertising executive Don Smolen – who had worked in the publicity campaign for eight Bond films before – emphasising the rougher content of the movie.|$|E
5|$|During {{his playing}} career, Martin greatly {{influenced}} {{the evolution of}} the sport of curling into a competitive sport. He was an instrumental part of the group that brought about the Grand Slam of Curling. In the early 2000s, he became the spokesperson for <b>the</b> <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial growth of curling, represented largely by the World Curling Tour, which was growing in popularity due to the benefits afforded by corporate sponsorship opportunities and cash prizes at tournaments. The Martin-led boycott of the Canadian Curling Association for its refusal to allow the developments in the World Curling Tour to be mirrored in the Brier catalyzed not only the transformation of the Brier, but also the growth of the Grand Slam, and in doing so, ultimately allowed the sport of curling to become a legitimate spectator sport. The development of the competitive tier of the sport also marked a change in both the players of the sport and the sport itself, as evidenced by improvements in the development and training of curlers as athletes and improvements in the quality of curling games due to better ice conditions and precision-based gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{from its}} outset, the Yalta {{decision}} favored the communists, who enjoyed {{the advantages of}} Soviet support within the Soviet plan of bringing Eastern Europe securely {{under the influence of}} the Soviet Union, as well as control over crucial government departments such as the security services (this activity was initially dominated by Lavrentiy Beria's Soviet NKVD). Beginning in the later part of 1944, following the defeat of the Warsaw Uprising and <b>the</b> <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> populist program of the PKWN, the London exiled government's delegation was increasingly seen by the majority of Poles as a failed enterprise, its political-military organizations became isolated, and the resistance against the new communist political and administrative forces decisively weakened. The population was tired of the years of oppression and conflict and the ideas expressed in the PKWN Manifesto and their progressive implementation attracted widening social support. From 1944 in liberated areas, responding to promulgated slogans, workers spontaneously took over existing factory installations, established workers' councils, undertook reconstruction, activation and production. A considerable labor struggle and compulsion were necessary for the PPR to claim the factories and enforce its own rules.|$|E
