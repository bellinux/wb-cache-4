Grand River Avenue <b>through</b> <b>there</b> was Business Loop I-96 (BLI-96). The freeway ends at a junction with Grand River Avenue that also {{marked the end of}} the business loop and the eastern end of I-96 at the time. From there, US16 continued along Grand River Avenue the rest of way into Downtown Detroit. Along that routing, it intersected US24 at Telegraph Road and M-39 at Southfield Road. US12 joined US16 along Grand River Avenue at Plymouth Road. The two ran {{the rest of the way}} concurrently to Cadillac Square. There they terminated at a common point with US10 (Woodward Avenue) and US112 (Michigan Avenue). US25 ran through the square on Fort Street and Gratiot Avenue.|$|E
25|$|With Rowand {{having made}} Edmonton his home, the fort became an {{important}} centre in the west. It was a necessity for any traveller going any further west of Edmonton to go <b>through</b> <b>there</b> for provisions first. Rowand constructed a three-storey house {{in the heart of}} the fort for the exclusive use of him and his family, denoting his station to his subordinates, visitors and trade partners alike.|$|E
25|$|The fractionally {{numbering}} arose because locks 70-75 {{were completed}} in 1842, before locks 62 and 66. It {{was found that}} the level of the canal between locks 62 and 66 could be raised in three steps instead of four. So the additional locks <b>through</b> <b>there</b> were numbered 1⅓ steps apart (62, 63⅓, 64⅔ and 66) so that the other locks, already completed, {{did not have to be}} renumbered.|$|E

25|$|We {{started off}} with no idea at all. We pretty much threw all the stuff in the pot and went on playing. It {{was a case of}} demand driving it. It took off like a rocket. We got more work than we could travel away, but the thing took {{on a life of its}} own. The thing with the Falcons, we never {{actually}} changed our style that much. We just accumulated new ones. It turned into a stratified thing 'cause we were mixing everything together all the way <b>through.</b> <b>There</b> was no plan. – John Power.|$|E
25|$|In Venice (1771–1772), {{where he}} was {{studying}} the works of Palladio, Quarenghi {{came into contact with}} a British lord passing <b>through</b> <b>there</b> on the Grand Tour. It was through him that the architect secured a few minor English commissions, such as garden pavilions, chimneypieces (Loukomsky 1928), an altar for the private Roman Catholic chapel of Henry Arundell at New Wardour Castle. Designs for a country house for Lord Whitworth were exhibited at Venice 1967. His first major commission (1771–7) was the internal reconstruction of the monastery of Santa Scholastica at Subiaco. For the Venetian cardinal Rezzonico, the nephew of Pope Clement XIII, he designed a decor for a Music Room in the Campidoglio, and designs for Clement's tomb (later executed by Antonio Canova).|$|E
25|$|Both {{lines are}} divided into 5 zones, the central zone being shared. Fares are {{calculated}} based on how many zones a journey is taken <b>through.</b> <b>There</b> is {{a stop on the}} border of each zone, which is considered to be in whichever zone is more beneficial to the traveller. The two lines do not connect, but it is possible to purchase tickets that are valid for a journey using both lines. It is necessary to walk or take other transport between the two lines, most commonly between St. Stephen's Green (on the green line) and Abbey Street (on the red line). Alternatives include buses (the number 145 links St. Stephen's Green to Heuston and the number 18 links Ranelagh to Kylemore, although these are not included on the ticket) and taxis.|$|E

25|$|The town was, {{in times}} past, {{connected}} with the once extensive narrow gauge rail network of County Donegal. This provided connections to Derry (and <b>through</b> <b>there</b> to Dublin and Belfast), to Lifford and Strabane, to Gweedore and Burtonport, and to Carndonagh, north of Derry. The rail system {{was built in the}} late 19th century, with the last extensions opening in the 20th century. Some of these lines were never profitable, built using then UK government subsidies. Only a couple of decades later, the independence of the Irish Free State {{from the rest of the}} UK resulted in rail companies operating across two jurisdictions where there had previously been one. This had devastating effects on an already fragile economic situation, resulting eventually in the final closure of all parts of the rail system in the area by December 1959.|$|E
25|$|For several years, the Automobile Club of New York {{had been}} {{lobbying}} New York City to sign state highways within the city, including US1. Their proposal was to sign US1 from the Holland Tunnel, then along Houston Street and Second Avenue, then crossing the Harlem River along the Willis Avenue Bridge, then via Southern Boulevard, West Farms Road, and Boston Road. In December 1934, New York City {{finally agreed to}} sign routes within the city. By this time, the new George Washington Bridge had opened and {{it was decided that}} US1 and US9 would be routed <b>through</b> <b>there.</b> The old proposed US1 alignment through Manhattan became NY1A. When first signed in New York City, US1 utilized 181st Street, then crossed the Harlem River on the Washington Bridge, and then continued on University Avenue and Fordham Road before continuing on modern US1. In 1977, US1 was moved to Webster Avenue and the Cross Bronx Expressway, crossing the Harlem River using the Alexander Hamilton Bridge.|$|E

The Portland Mercury {{said the}} restaurant was a [...] "kinda retro-y bar... popular with a young college-y, drinkin', party crowd". One Portland resident described the club as [...] "the {{kind of place where}} you can go with your sophisticated friends and look at the Daddy-O decor.

500|$|Ellie is {{characterized}} as [...] "trong, witty, {{and a little}} rough around the edges". Her emotional trauma is accentuated after her encounter with David. Having lost many people in her life, she suffers from severe monophobia and survivor's guilt. This results in her becoming a very hardened person; she uses violence without hesitation and frequently swears. Ellie also feels worthless, believing her life is a burden, and that her death would be beneficial for others. While she shows initiative, she is not as adept at survival as Joel, being somewhat impulsive and naïve, and unable to swim. Despite this, she displays great physical resilience, emotional strength and complete fearlessness, as demonstrated by her ability to look after both herself and Joel when he is severely injured. She constantly perseveres {{in the face of}} the many often dire situations that her travels put her <b>through.</b> <b>There</b> is a scene where Ellie kisses her friend Riley. After the game was released, Druckmann said that he wrote Ellie as a gay character, though he preferred to leave the subject of her sexuality up to players to decide.|$|E
500|$|Also in 1996, Murphy began {{studying}} law at University College Cork (UCC), but he failed {{his first year}} exams because, as he put it, he had [...] "no ambitions to do it". Not only was he busy with his band, but {{he has said that}} he knew within days after starting at UCC that law was not what he wanted to do. After seeing Corcadorca's stage production of , directed by Kiernan, acting had begun to pique his interest. His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society's amateur production of Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, also starring Irish American comedian, Des Bishop. Murphy also played the lead in a UCC Drama production of Little Shop of Horrors, which was performed in the Cork Opera House. According to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women, not to begin an acting career. Nonetheless, he began to move away from working as a rock musician, about which he later remarked, [...] "I think there's {{such a thing as a}} performance gene. If it's in your DNA it needs to come out. For me it originally came out through music, then segued into acting and came out <b>through</b> <b>there.</b> I always needed to get up and perform." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Bezerro maldito or the [...] "Damned Calf" [...] was {{a damned}} bull or calf that {{walked through the}} streets of Póvoa, and the people in their homes listened to the sound of its {{footsteps}} while walking through the street. In Póvoa there were no cattle, these only existed in the surrounding villages. Tia Desterra, a notable local storyteller, always listened to these stories as a child, claimed to see the damned calf on a windy summer evening. She said he was black and white, and when the calf walked <b>through,</b> <b>there</b> was so much wind that it twisted.|$|E
2500|$|The {{embankment}} across Penryn Creek {{was similarly}} ill thought <b>through.</b> <b>There</b> {{was to be}} an embankment (or viaduct) with a drawbridge to pass ships to Penryn Harbour; the waterway was tidal, of course, and the sailing ships needed sea room to beat up the channel, and needed to do so {{at the top of}} the tide. Steep railway gradients were necessary either side of the crossing. Evidence was given that the obstruction by Moorsom's embankment made it quite unacceptable, and several [...] "memorials" [...] had been submitted to that effect. In his evidence at the Lords Committee, Moorsom seemed to know little of the formal objections to the scheme.|$|E
