25|$|Criminals {{have been}} known to wear <b>leather</b> gloves during <b>the</b> {{commission}} of crimes. Gloves are worn by criminals because the tactile properties of <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> allow for good grip and dexterity. These properties are the result of a grain present on the surface of <b>the</b> <b>leather.</b> <b>The</b> grain makes the surface of <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> unique to each glove. Investigators are able to dust for the glove prints left behind from <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> <b>the</b> same way in which they dust for fingerprints.|$|R

50|$|Commercial stamps are {{available}} in various designs, typically geometric or representative of animals. Most stamping is performed on vegetable tanned leather that has been dampened with water, as the water makes <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> softer and able to be compressed by the design being pressed or stamped into it using a press. After <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> has been stamped, the design stays on <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> as it dries out, but it can fade if <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> becomes wet and is flexed. To make the impressions last longer, <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> is conditioned with oils and fats to make it waterproof and prevent the fibers from deforming.|$|R
50|$|During {{the winter}} of 1847-1848 <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> flap valve that sealed the {{traction}} pipe slot began to give trouble. During the cold days of winter <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> froze hard in frost after saturation in rain. This resulted in its failing to seat properly {{after the passage of}} a train, allowing air into the pipe and reducing the effectiveness of pumping. In the following spring and summer there was hot and dry weather and <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> valve dried out, with pretty much the same outcome. Brunel had <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> treated with whale oil in an attempt to maintain flexibility. There was said to be a chemical reaction between the tannin in <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> and iron oxide on the pipe. There were also difficulties with <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> cup seal on the pistons.|$|R

5000|$|All leather {{needs to}} be {{prepared}} a certain way for leather carvers to carve <b>the</b> <b>leather.</b> <b>The</b> <b>leather</b> carver will [...] "case" [...] <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> by soaking it in water,then letting it dry to the proper dampness, thus making <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> easier to tool. If <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> is too dry, impressions will fade over time, or will not be made to a consistent depth. Too wet, it will not hold a sharply defined carving. Properly cased leather feels cool to the touch, and has the feel, of firm, wet clay.

5000|$|By 1950, Cahn {{had taken}} over the business. During the early years, Cahn noticed the {{distinctive}} properties and qualities of <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> used to make baseball gloves. With wear and use, <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> in a glove became softer and suppler. Attempting to mimic this process, Cahn made a way of processing <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> to make it stronger, softer, and more flexible. Since <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> absorbed dye very well, this process also created a richer, deeper color in <b>the</b> <b>leather.</b> [...] Soon after Cahn developed this new process, Lillian Cahn suggested to Miles that the company supplement the factory's men's accessories business by adding women's <b>leather</b> handbags. <b>The</b> [...] "sturdy cowhide bags were an immediate hit." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{repeated}} stroking of <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> smooths and compresses {{the surface}} and raises various color tones. Heat generated by friction during the glazing process can darken and harden the aniline finish of <b>the</b> <b>leather,</b> and can raise oils in <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> to <b>the</b> surface. Because no pigment is used, the porous structure of <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> remains visible, providing a depth to its appearance. The operator of the glazing jack can control the surface finish by varying {{the pressure of the}} tool and the number of strokes applied.|$|R

50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> {{has been}} {{properly}} cased, the swivel knife {{is used to}} make the bold cuts that form the backbone of the carved image. These cuts are made to a depth of up to approximately half the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> being used, depending on the effect desired by <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> worker. Care must be taken during this step to keep the swivel knife vertical at all times, as any tilt is detrimental to the ability of <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> to be properly stamped later in the carving process.|$|R

5000|$|Although [...] "Connollising" [...] is {{somewhat}} shrouded in secret, it basically involves scrubbing down <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> with a cleaner/soap while using a stiff brush (such as a nail brush) or slightly abrasive sponge which thins and removes {{most of the}} original surface color & finish. <b>The</b> <b>leather</b> is then moisturized and recolored, bringing it back as close to original condition as possible. Connollising involves <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> surface more than <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> itself.

30|$|With the {{development}} of this work {{it was found that the}} application of all surface treatments on leather/TR adhesive joint provides the highest failure strength in the peel test. Taking into account that <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> has a surface with low surface tension, if mechanical treatment is not applied, the application of chemical treatment on the TR does not cause any improvement in the joint strength and rupture occurs by the surface layer of <b>the</b> <b>leather.</b> That is, rupture occurs by the interface adhesive/leather. Considering the leather/TR, if only a mechanical treatment is applied on <b>the</b> <b>leather,</b> it is possible to obtain an increase of the peel strength. The primer on <b>the</b> <b>leather</b> works as a reinforcement. The mechanical treatment allows the anchoring of the adhesive and will decrease the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>leather.</b> When primer and mechanical treatment are combined, the peel strength of an adhesive joint is increased.|$|R
