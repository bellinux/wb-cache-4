40|$|Maintaining the {{freshness}} of shrimp is a concern to shrimp stakeholders. To improve shrimp quality management, it is of importance <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>shrimp</b> spoilage characteristics. Therefore, microbiological, sensory, and chemical changes of naturally contaminated tropical brackish water shrimp (Penaeus notialis) during storage at 28 °C, 7 °C and 0 °C were assessed. H 2 S-producing bacteria were the dominant group of microorganisms at 28 °C and 7 °C whereas Pseudomonas spp. were dominant at 0 °C. Total volatile basic nitrogen and trimethylamine correlated well (R 2 > 0. 90) with the sensory scores. An empirical model to predict the shelf-life of naturally contaminated tropical shrimp {{as a function of}} storage temperature was developed. Specific groups of organisms were isolated at the sensory rejection times and assessed for spoilage potential in shrimps of which the endogenous flora was heat inactivated. Isolates capable of producing strong off-odor identified by 16 S rRNA sequencing were mainly lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Enterobacteriaceae at 28 °C or 7 °C and Pseudomonas spp. and LAB at 0 °C. The study contributes to the knowledge about tropical shrimp spoilage and provides a basis for the development of methods and tools to improve shrimp quality management.

40|$|AbstractThe shrimp {{is popular}} for its {{nutrition}} and dainty, however, {{it is easy}} to decay, and its freshness degrades, so, it is important to assess its freshness. The shrimp gives off unpleasant odor with its freshness change, detecting its odor difference can evaluate its freshness. The feasibility of using electronic nose for evaluating the freshness of shrimp (Penaeus vanmamei) is explored in this paper. The odor of shrimp, stored at 5 °C, was detected by the electronic nose. Combined with the sensory evaluation and TVBN, a model based on the electronic nose was constructed <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> the <b>shrimp</b> freshness. In principal components analysis, the first three principal components accounted for 86. 97 % of total variation, and they are used to establish a model to estimate the shrimp freshness with Fisher Liner Discriminant.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> the <b>shrimp</b> trawl fishery in the seas off Negombo and Hendala during the period January 1998 to December 1999. In the shallow seas off west coast trawling is conducted by two types of crafts viz. 3. 5 t wooden boats (mechanised trawls) and traditional sail driven large dug out canoes (non-mechanised trawls). The total catch effort and the catch per unit effort showed seasonal variations. A seasonality in the trawl fishery was observed with a peak period from June/July to October/November, which apparently coincided with the south west monsoon and the inter monsoon periods of the island. The statistical analysis indicated that the catch rates of both craft types observed during the south west monsoon {{were significantly higher than}} during north east and inter monsoon periods (P< 0. 05). There is no substantial difference between the estimated mean catch rates for the two craft types for the two years study. The estimated annual fish productivity of the non-mechanised and mechanised trawls were 390 and 208 MT in 1998 and 403 and 259 MT in 1999 respectively. Penaeid shrimps formed 60 - 64 % of the catch of the west coast trawl fishery. Trawl by-catch mainly consisted of sea crabs, sciaenids, leiognathids and Opisthopterus tardoore. The shrimp: by-catch ratio for the trawl operations in the study area were estimated at 1 : 0. 67 for non-mechanised trawls and 1 : 0. 56 for mechanised trawls. The estimated mean income per trawl operation varied from Rs. 930 to 2, 960 (Mean = Rs. 1, 660) for non-mechanised trawls and from Rs. 470 to 4, 240 (Mean = Rs. 1, 860) for mechanised trawls.

40|$|The {{intensification}} of the shrimp farming industry has generated much concern over its environmental, {{social and economic}} sustainability. The objective of this dissertation was to conduct a comprehensive sustainability analysis for Chinese shrimp farming. My results could be utilized <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> and improve <b>shrimp</b> production systems in terms of environmental sustainability, economic profitability, and social acceptability. Life cycle assessment was conducted <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> environmental performance of different shrimp farming systems. Intensive systems had higher environmental impacts per unit production than semi-intensive. The grow-out stage contributed on average 95 % of the overall impacts, mainly caused by feed production, electricity use and effluents. To produce 1 tonne live-weight of shrimp in China, 38. 3 ± 4. 3 GJ of energy and 40. 4 ± 1. 7 tonnes of net primary productivity were required, and 23. 1 ± 2. 6 kg of SO 2 equivalents (eq), 36. 9 ± 4. 3 kg of PO 4 eq, and 3. 1 ± 0. 4 tonnes of CO 2 eq were generated. Changes in feed composition, farm management, electricity generating sources, and effluent treatment may result in future improvement. Mathematical models were developed to study nutrient dynamics {{and the effects of}} management strategies on nutrient dynamics and discharge. Management strategies had significant impacts on nutrient dynamics. Nutrient loading increased with farm intensity. On average, approximately 701 kg N ha- 1 cycle- 1 (100 days/cycle) and 176 kg P ha- 1 cycle- 1 were unutilized and wasted. Of them, 120 kg N ha- 1 cycle- 1 in dissolved form and 62 kg P ha- 1 cycle- 1 were discharged with effluents. Moderate stocking density and reduced water exchange could minimize environmental impacts of pond effluents and achieve high production. A socioeconomic survey of 100 shrimp farms was conducted <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> system profitability, disease risk, and changes in quality of life. Production costs per kilogram of shrimp were highest in intensive systems ($ 2. 70), followed by semi-intensive ($ 2. 10) and polyculture ($ 1. 05) systems. Intensive systems had significantly higher profits ($ 9, 500 ha- 1 crop- 1) than the other two systems (< $ 7, 300 ha- 1 crop- 1). If disease occurred, an average of 78 % and 36 % of shrimp would die in the worst and most probable cases, respectively. Disease had highest influence on the intensive systems.

40|$|In central Philippines, the Aquaculture Department of the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center (SEAFDEC/AQD), {{with strong}} {{collaboration}} {{and support from}} the Research Institute for Humanity and Nature (RIHN) of Kyoto, Japan, has been looking into the stock enhancement of tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon in the New Washington Estuary (NWE), province of Aklan, central Philippines. The NWE was a productive fishing ground that has been suffering from degenerating brackishwater fisheries and estuarine environment. Average daily catch declined from 24 kg in 1970 s to only 0. 7 kg at present. Shrimp fisheries, the most important livelihood, declined in quality and quantity. Tiger shrimps were abundant in catch until the early 1990 s when these were observed to decline in volume, replaced by smaller and cheaper species. This was coincidental with the rapid decline in mangrove cover for ponds and huge increase in fishing pressure. It is clear that crucial interventions are required to restore the tiger shrimp fisheries in the NWE {{in order to increase}} income of local fishers, while promoting reduction of fishing gears and restoration of mangroves. Stock enhancement of tiger shrimps shows good potential in answering these needs. Site-specific assessments were conducted <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> prospects of <b>shrimp</b> stock enhancement in NWE. Conservative simulations of capture of released stocks showed that fishers can increase income by 300 %. To decrease fishing pressure in the area, number of gears per fisher may have to be reduced but shrimp catches will be relatively high-priced. Comparative experiments using aquaculture techniques were done to identify strategies especially in the delicate intermediate acclimation rearing. Aquaculture protocols like those for pond preparation were also adapted to be used in a mangrove pen nursery rearing system for shrimps. Supplemental feeding with formulated feeds increased carrying capacity of the culture area, while enhancing growth and survival of stocks. Culture experiments showed that shrimps grow to 0. 5 g within 1 mo and > 1 g in 2 mo. High stocking density of 40 - 60 shrimps m- 2 can be used for < 2 mo rearing in a mangrove pen. Release experiments showed that 60 -d old shrimps have higher chances of survival when released in the estuaries. With strong support from local communities, government and other sectors, together with effective management and law enforcement, aquaculture-based stock enhancement of tiger shrimps can be a viable intervention to restore livelihood and promote estuarine rehabilitation in the NWE...|$|R

The intertwined histories of the country's mangrove forests and culture ponds are treated in depth; brackishwater aquaculture and the different shrimp culture systems are described. Intensive farming is {{discussed in terms of}} feed and water requirements, chemical inputs and waste production, and the attendant organic and nutrient overloading, longevity and toxicity of chemicals, development of antibiotic resistance, and introduction of exotic species. Most of the discussion is based on the Philippine experience, but relevant case studies from other shrimpâ€�growing countries, notably Thailand and Indonesia, and also from salmon cage culture in the temperate zone, are included. Ecologically and economically more viable, semiâ€�intensive culture is recommended as the key to the longâ€�term sustainability of the shrimp industry. Because the greatest impact of brackishwater pond culture (including shrimp farming) is the loss of mangrove habitats and their varied goods and services, massive reforestation of degraded areas should be undertaken. Other recommendations are the promotion of environmentally sound aquaculture technologies, e. g., seaweed and mollusc culture and the integrated forestryâ€�aquacultureâ€�fisheries management of mangrove plantations (tumpang sari) in coastal areas; enforcement of existing laws that protect remaining mangroves; and promulgation of new laws to regulate water use and waste disposal.
