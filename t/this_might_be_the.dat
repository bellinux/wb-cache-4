5|$|The second theory {{posits that}} either {{increased}} {{blood flow to}} the brain or increase in the brain tissue itself may result in the raised pressure. Little evidence has accumulated to support the suggestion that increased blood flow plays a role, but recently Bateman et al. in phase contrast MRA studies have quantified cerebral blood flow (CBF) in vivo and suggests that CBF is abnormally elevated in many patients with IIH. Both biopsy samples and various types of brain scans have shown an increased water content of the brain tissue. It remains unclear why <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case.|$|E

25|$|South Africa and North Africa aside, most African economies {{have not}} grown faster since independence. One {{possible}} reason for <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> taxation on export agriculture.

25|$|A {{landmark}} {{study of}} bison genetics that {{was performed by}} James Derr of the Texas A University corroborated this. The Derr study was undertaken {{in an attempt to}} determine what genetic problems bison might face as they repopulate former areas, and it noted that bison were faring well, despite their apparent genetic bottleneck. One possible explanation for <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> small amount of domestic cattle genes that are now in most bison populations, though this is not the only possible explanation for bison success.|$|E
25|$|On {{the outside}} of the church, {{immediately}} below the west window, is a carving of a cat and it is suggested that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> origin of the Cheshire cat.

25|$|The English name Acoma was {{borrowed}} from Spanish Ácoma (1583) or Acóma (1598). The Spanish name was {{borrowed from}} the Acoma word ʔáák’u̓u̓m̓é meaning 'person from Acoma Pueblo'. ʔáák’u̓u̓m̓é itself is derived from ʔáák’u (singular, plural: ʔaak’u̓u̓m̓e̓e̓ʈʂʰa). The name {{does not have any}} meaning in the modern Acoma language. Some tribal authorities connect it to the similar word háák’u 'preparedness, place of preparedness' and suggest that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> origin of the name. The name does not mean 'sky city'. Other tribal elders assert that it means 'place that always was' while outsiders say it means 'people of the white rock'.|$|E

25|$|In reality, however, {{this is not}} correct. It is true that Nunó, Henneman and Hill did {{register}} the music with the company BMI (BMI Work #568879), with the Edward B.

However, United States copyright law declares the Mexican anthem {{to be in the}} public domain inside the United States, since both the lyrics and music were published before 1909. Furthermore, under Mexican copyright law, Article 155 states that the government holds moral rights, but not property rights, of the national symbols, including the anthem, coat of arms and the national flag.|$|E
25|$|One {{analogy is}} to think of helium-4 as ash, {{and the amount of}} ash that one forms when one {{completely}} burns a piece of wood is insensitive to how one burns it. The resort to the BBN theory of the helium-4 abundance is necessary as there is far more helium-4 in the universe than can be explained by stellar nucleosynthesis. In addition, it provides an important test for the Big Bang theory. If the observed helium abundance is significantly different from 25%, then this would pose a serious challenge to the theory. This would particularly be the case if the early helium-4 abundance was much smaller than 25% because it is hard to destroy helium-4. For a few years during the mid-1990s, observations suggested that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case, causing astrophysicists to talk about a Big Bang nucleosynthetic crisis, but further observations were consistent with the Big Bang theory.|$|E

25|$|Later, Sae {{leaves for}} New York and meets up with Junichi, and they worked {{together}} in the same company. Junichi proposed to Sae later on. Sae returned to Kushiro to attend her friend Minami's wedding, and she found out that Kouhei was married to Ritsuko. However, Ritsuko was jealous of the way Sae and her husband were interacting. Kouhei then met Sae at the lighthouse, and Sae tells him that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last time she visits Japan since she may get married. Having seen each other after such a long time, they can't resist anymore and they embrace each other passionately in front of Sae's house while dropping her off, but their responsibilities towards their better halves (in her case, her fiancé) force them to reluctantly part ways. When Kouhei returned, he found Ritsuko waiting for him on the steps with bad news- the bank might make them bankrupt. Kouhei manages to settle the problem, but he found Ritsuko's divorce papers on the table when he returned. The scene ends with a news report stating that Junichi was killed in Iraq.|$|E

500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend focused {{primarily}} on the series finale in her review but referred to this episode as containing a solid case-of-the-week. “Overall {{it was a good}} mystery-of-the-week but seeing as it was the second to last episode, the only thing I cared about was that we finally got more Weevil!” Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review, stating that the case-of-the-week was an oversimplification of the overall themes of Veronica Mars. The reviewer enjoyed the potential for Logan and Dick’s character development, although he felt that it was blunted by the knowledge that the series was about to end. “As fun as this episode is, the lack of the fourth season stops me from fully enjoying it.

Mendelsohn eventually revealed the crossover at the Banff event in Canada. After the episode was taped, Lorre stated: [...] "The biggest challenge for us was doing a comedy with a murder in it.

[...] Despite not being released as a single, [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] did manage to peak at number ninety-four on Billboard Pop 100, on the week of December 10, 2008, due to moderate airplay on mainstream top 40 radio stations, singles sales, and digital downloads.|$|E
500|$|Ahsan Haque of IGN rated [...] "Stewie Kills Lois" [...] a 9/10, while rating [...] "Lois Kills Stewie" [...] a 9.4/10, saying [...] "For the {{hundredth}} episode of Family Guy, Seth McFarlane and friends tackle {{the subject of}} one of Stewie Griffin's greatest ambitions— his not-so-secret desire to kill his mother. For the disturbed fans waiting for some form of a matricidal manifestation, you can feel comfort knowing, without spoiling too much, that the youngest Griffin absolutely means business and ensures that he doesn't fail this time around. [...] There are some tense courtroom moments, a birthday celebration with the gift of Lionel Richie, a cruise ship, machine guns, and the reappearance of the Kool Aid Man that help round out this carefully crafted and well-told cohesive storyline. With the amount of cheap manatee jokes kept to a reasonable level, this episode also manages to find an excellent balance between comedy and storytelling. It's a fantastic way to celebrate the Family Guy one-hundredth episode milestone. [...] With the writers' strike in full effect, it seems that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last new episode of Family Guy we'll be seeing for a while.
