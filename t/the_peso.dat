5|$|In the mid-1820s, when Manuel José García was Minister of Finance, the {{government}} borrowed heavily to finance new projects {{and to pay}} off war debts. These loans were tendered at usurious rates: in one notorious loan, {{the government}} received credit for £570,000 from the Baring Brothers {{in exchange for a}} debt of £1,000,000. In the 1820s, <b>the</b> <b>peso</b> papel began to lose value rapidly with respect to <b>the</b> <b>peso</b> fuerte, which was linked to the price of gold. In 1827 <b>the</b> <b>peso</b> papel was devalued by 33%, and was devalued again by 68% in 1829.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{government}} reined in inflation by making <b>the</b> <b>peso</b> equal in {{value to the}} U.S. dollar, and privatised numerous state-run companies, using part of the proceeds to reduce the national debt. However, a sustained recession {{at the turn of}} the 21st century culminated in a default, and the government again devalued <b>the</b> <b>peso.</b> By 2005 the economy had recovered, but a judicial ruling originating from the previous crisis led to a new default in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In 1838 {{there was}} a new {{currency}} crisis, and <b>the</b> <b>peso</b> papel was devalued by 34%, and in 1839 when <b>the</b> <b>peso</b> papel lost 66% of its value. It was again devalued by 95% in 1845, and by 40% in 1851. The Alsina years, which coincided with the secession of Buenos Aires, saw an extremely poor economic performance. Efforts to fund extraordinary expenditure on the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces of the Confederation caused the fiscal deficit to skyrocket. Similarly, the Confederation faced harsh economic conditions. Urquiza, president of the Confederation, issued the 'law of differential rights', benefiting the ships trading with the ports of the Confederation and but not with Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|When the {{military}} dictatorship finance minister Martinez de Hoz assumed power, inflation was equivalent {{to an annual}} rate of 5000%, and output had declined sharply. In 1976, the era of import substitution was ended, and the government lowered import barriers, liberalized restrictions on foreign borrowing, and supported <b>the</b> <b>peso</b> against foreign currencies.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{abandoned}} {{the gold standard}} in December 1929, earlier than most countries. For much of the previous period, the country had operated a currency board, in which a body known as the caja de conversión was charged with maintaining the peso's value in gold. The devaluation of <b>the</b> <b>peso</b> increased the competitiveness of its exports and protected domestic production. Argentina saw {{the value of its}} exports drop from $1,537 million in 1929 to $561 million in 1932, but this was by no means the most severe downturn in the region.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{fell into}} a deep {{recession}} {{in the second half of}} 1998, triggered and then compounded by a series of adverse external shocks, which included low prices for agricultural commodities, the appreciation of the US dollar, to which <b>the</b> <b>peso</b> was pegged at par, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the LTCM crisis and the devaluation of the Brazilian real in January 1999. Argentina did not enjoy a rapid recovery, and the sluggishness of GDP growth fuelled concerns about the sustainability of public debt.|$|E

Barr's death was {{followed}} shortly afterwards by the Mexican peso crisis, which meant most of the US-based wrestlers were able to earn only a fraction of what they were used to while working for AAA. <b>The</b> <b>peso</b> crisis led to Eddie Guerrero working for the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) instead. At the time of Barr's death, both wrestlers were in negotiations to work for ECW part-time, which became full-time in 1995. Guerrero would later end up working full-time for World Championship Wrestling, which had produced When Worlds Collide. After Barr's death, AAA retired the AAA World Tag Team Championship in Barr's honor. With Barr dying and Guerrero leaving, Los Gringos Locos was abandoned as well.|$|E
5|$|In August 1982, after Mexico had {{announced}} {{its inability to}} service its debt, Argentina approached the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for ﬁnancial assistance, as it too was in serious difficulties. While developments looked positive for a while, an IMF staff team visiting Buenos Aires in August 1983 discovered a variety of problems, particularly a loss of control over wages affecting both the budget and external competitiveness, and the program failed. With <b>the</b> <b>peso</b> quickly losing value to inflation, the new Argentine peso argentino was introduced in 1983, with 10,000 old pesos exchanged for each new peso.|$|E

5|$|On August 13, 1898, the Spanish–American War {{ended with}} Spain ceding Puerto Rico to the United States. The Banco Español de Puerto Rico was renamed Bank of Porto Rico and issued bills {{equivalent}} to the United States dollar, creating the Puerto Rican dollar. In 1902, the First National Bank of Porto Rico issued banknotes in a parallel manner. Two more series were issued until 1913. After Puerto Rico's economy and monetary system was fully integrated into the United States' economic and monetary system, the Puerto Rican dollars were redeemed for those issued by the United States Treasury. <b>The</b> <b>peso</b> and dollar have been followed by other contemporary issues, including commemorative banknotes, private currency, and a quarter coin designed with Fort San Felipe del Morro in the face.|$|E
5|$|Duhalde, Alfonsín, their parties, {{the unions}} and the Church all agreed to promote {{policies}} {{to increase the}} industrial growth of the country. For this purpose, Duhalde created the ministry of production, with functions that used {{to belong to the}} ministries of economy and foreign relations. The new minister was José Ignacio de Mendiguren, head of the Argentine Industrial Union. Alfonsín negotiated with him, on Duhalde's behalf, while Congress was still voting for the new president. Duhalde announced at his inauguration that he would repeal the convertibility plan, considered the main cause of the economic crisis. Although Menem proposed a full dollarization of the Argentine economy, Duhalde preferred to instead stick to <b>the</b> <b>peso</b> and order a devaluation. Although it was initially expected to make a 40% devaluation, the exchange rate of 1 peso to 1 dollar jumped to 3 pesos to 1 dollar, a 200% devaluation. The higher dollar price allowed for more lucrative exports, increased economic activity and a growth in the employment rates, but at the cost of a higher cost of living.|$|E
5|$|During {{his short}} time in office, Rodríguez Saá {{announced}} {{the creation of}} a new currency, the argentino, which would have circulated alongside <b>the</b> <b>peso</b> and the dollar. The civil unrest of previous days resurfaced when he announced his cabinet, as it included Carlos Grosso as Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers. Grosso was a very unpopular former mayor of Buenos Aires. As a result, Rodríguez Saá gave up his whole cabinet before they could take office, with the sole exception of Rodolfo Gabrielli, in the Interior Ministry. He also declared a sovereign default on the Argentine national debt, which was celebrated by the chamber of deputies. It was the highest sovereign default in history. Those measures, uncharacteristic of an interim president with a brief term of office, were rescented by the leaders of the Justicialist party.|$|E

5|$|The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis {{affected}} the economy, {{resulting in a}} lingering decline {{of the value of}} <b>the</b> <b>peso</b> and falls in the stock market. The extent it was affected initially was not as severe as that of some of its Asian neighbors. This was largely due to the fiscal conservatism of the government, {{partly as a result of}} decades of monitoring and fiscal supervision from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in comparison to the massive spending of its neighbors on the rapid acceleration of economic growth. There have been signs of progress since. In 2004, the economy experienced 6.4% GDP growth and 7.1% in 2007, its fastest pace of growth in three decades. Average annual GDP growth per capita for the period 1966–2007 still stands at 1.45% in comparison to an average of 5.96% for the East Asia and the Pacific region as a whole. The daily income for 45% of the population of the Philippines remains less than $2.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the issuing of situado concluded, {{with two}} last {{deliveries}} of 500,000 and 100,000 between 1809 and 1810. This brought forth a critical economical crisis to Puerto Rico. At the moment, Salvador Meléndez Bruna, the colonial governor in office, ordered {{the production of}} provincial paper money. The decree was officially enacted on August 31, 1812. These banknotes used <b>the</b> <b>peso</b> being used as equivalent to Spanish reales. Produced by hand, these banknotes featured quantities in the thousands, with 1 peso being worth 8 reales. Mechanical printing had arrived to Puerto Rico years earlier, but up until 1813, part of the issued notes were being produced by hand and stamped. Between 1812 and 1813, the tradition of collecting paper money continued, which reduced the amount of surviving banknotes drastically. The other notes printed between 1813 and 1814, featured a combination of printed types and stamps, the printing was done by Puerto Rico's National Printing Office and featured patterns to prevent the production of counterfeits. Those featuring denominations in reales, were adorned by Spain's Royal Seal, with the color varying depending on the date of issue, the 1813 8-real banknotes featured a lamb on the obverse. However, these security measures were ineffective against counterfeiting, eventually copies of several denominations were circulating in a widespread manner, forcing cities outside of San Juan, Arecibo and Loiza to discontinue their use. Meléndez Bruna decided {{that the only way}} to prevent forgery was by asking Spain to produce sealed paper for the printing of the banknotes. The first issue bore the signatures of treasurers or accountants, but this was dropped the subsequent year.|$|E
