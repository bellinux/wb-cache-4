40|$|SLAC’s COHE program {{requires}} {{compliance with}} OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910. 147, “The control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout). ” <b>This</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>specifies</b> lockout/tagout requirements during {{service and maintenance}} of equipment in which the unexpected energization or start up of the equipment, or release of stored energy, could cause injury to workers. Class 3 B and Class 4 laser radiation must be considered as hazardous energy (as well as electrical energy in associated equipment, and other non-beam energy hazards) in laser facilities, and therefore requires careful COHE consideration. This paper describes how COHE is achieved at SLAC to protect workers against unexpected Class 3 B or Class 4 laser radiation, independent of whether the mode of operation is normal, service, or maintenance. 1...|$|E

5000|$|There were {{no formal}} {{standards}} in the United States defining broadcasting stations until December 1, 1921, when the Department of Commerce--which regulated radio at <b>this</b> time-issued a <b>regulation</b> <b>specifying</b> that stations making broadcasts intended {{for the general public}} now had to hold a Limited Commercial license that authorized operation on 360 or 485 meters. WJZ was one of a small number of stations that already met this standard {{at the time of its}} adoption. It was also the second oldest of the two licenses previously issued for the state of New Jersey, preceded by RCA's WDY grant. However, WJZ was the first to go on the air, as WDY didn't begin operations until two and a half months after WJZ's debut.|$|R
25|$|If {{significant}} use of bicycles {{for shopping}} trips {{is to be}} achieved, sufficient retail services must be maintained within reasonable cycling distances of residential areas. In countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany {{the high levels of}} utility cycling also includes shopping trips e.g. 9% of all shopping trips in Germany are by bicycle. It is arguable that this is related to policies that favour access to retail services by non-motorised modes. The Danish 1997 Planning Act requires that planning shall encourage a diverse mix of retail shops in small and medium-sized towns and in individual districts of large cities and ensure that retail trade uses will be placed in locations to which people have good access by walking, bicycling and public transport. From the mid-1970s the Netherlands has had policies in place to severely restrict the growth of large out-of-town retail developments. Germany has had federal planning regulations in place to restrict retail uses to designated areas since the 1960s. In addition, since the 1970s federal regulations have been in place specifying that developments above a certain size (1,200m²) be assessed regarding potential adverse effects. These federal regulations are further strengthened by regionally adopted <b>regulations.</b> <b>This</b> includes <b>regulations</b> <b>specifying</b> that new retail centres be limited to selling products not readily provided by shops at inner city/town centre locations. In Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany, this approach not restricted to planning guidelines and is also supported by a ban on below cost selling. This supports smaller shops by preventing large multiples from engaging in predatory pricing practices by aggressively discounting key goods to use as so called loss leaders.|$|R
