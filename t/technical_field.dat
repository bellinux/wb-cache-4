25|$|Other {{important}} advances {{occurred in}} the <b>technical</b> <b>field.</b> The first navigation aid, GEE, was introduced to help pilots to find their targets. Window, small metal strips dropped from aircraft, was introduced to help confuse the German radars. Planes also got their own radar, the H2S radar system. It provided a radar map of the ground beneath the aircraft, allowing navigation with more accuracy to cities like Berlin which were at that time beyond the effective range of systems like Gee. However, {{probably the most important}} innovation to improve targeting accuracy was tactical, not technical. It was the introduction of the pathfinder system. Pathfinders were groups of specially trained aircrews who flew ahead of the main raid and marked the target. Their use greatly improved the accuracy and destructiveness of raids.|$|E

40|$|Women’s low {{enrolment}} in <b>technical</b> <b>fields</b> in {{tertiary education}} is a worldwide phenomenon that {{is an area of}} concern for women’s equality. While this concern is substantial, a much greater concern for women’s low enrolment in <b>technical</b> <b>fields</b> is how their absence can affect a developing country. This paper will explore {{the role of women in}} <b>technical</b> <b>fields</b> in development. This paper hypothesizes that women represent a distinctive body of labour in <b>technical</b> <b>fields</b> as a result of their unique ideas and contributions. Their absence in these fields can have negative consequences on societies and countries in that, if women pursued more technology-based educations, they could greatly influence the creative and productive capacity of a country in relation to international competitiveness. By examining the country of Thailand and its current development struggles, this paper identifies the value of women in <b>technical</b> <b>fields</b> and on developing countries...|$|R

2500|$|These {{excavations}} have dug about [...] of tunnels {{inside the}} pyramid, {{which began with}} two in 1931 {{to prove that the}} hill was an archeological find. Within, he discovered altars with offerings, floors, walls and buried human remains from around 900 CE. Today, only about 800 meters of these tunnels are open to the public, which have been made into well-lit, arched passages. Visitors enter on the north side, {{through the center of the}} pyramid and exit on the south side. There are few signs explaining the structures within, but in one section allows a view of main staircases of one of the pyramids, whose nine floors have been excavated from bottom to top. There are also two famous murals. One is called [...] "Chapulines" [...] which consists of images of grasshoppers with a black skull in the middle. And the other is the [...] "Bebidores" [...] which depicts various figures drinking out of vessels most commonly used for pulque. Cholula, despite its importance, has not been studied as intensively as other Mesoamerican sites, and most of what does exist are <b>technical</b> <b>field</b> reports with few syntheses of data gathered. For this reason, it has not played a significant role in the understanding of Mesoamerica as to date. Due to the condition of the surface and the large number of artifacts just under the surface, it is not possible to reconstruct the last stage of the pyramid to what it was. Around the pyramid, there are a number of other structures and patios, which forma a massive complex. The Patio of the Altars was the main access to the pyramid and is named for the various altars that surround a main courtyard.|$|E

The train was shunted up; she took her seat in it. Just as it was starting, an early newspaper boy came along, yawning. Beatrice bought a copy of the Standard, out of the one and threepence that was left of her money, and opened it at the sheet containing the leading articles. The first one began, [...] "The most powerful, closely reasoned, and eloquent speech made last night by Mr. Bingham, the Member for Pillham, will, we feel certain, produce as great an effect on the country as it did in the House of Commons. We welcome it, not only on account of its value as a contribution to the polemics of the Irish Question, but as a positive proof of what has already been suspected, that the Unionist party has in Mr. Bingham a young statesman of a very high order indeed, and one whom remarkable and rapid success at the Bar has not hampered, as is too often the case, in the larger and less <b>technical</b> <b>field</b> of politics." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a method of {{identifying}} trends in technological convergence on the level of <b>technical</b> <b>fields.</b> Defining convergence as an inherently stable process of structuration of inter-technological patterns over time we are using German patent data and project them onto the structure of the output of standards via a concordance list of IPC symbols and ICS classes. Using a set of criteria for a reliable measurement of technological convergence we device a set of methods ranging from explorative identification of agglomerations of <b>technical</b> <b>fields,</b> analyses of the breadth of <b>technical</b> <b>fields</b> to differentiate between focussed and diffused convergence trends and in-depth analysis using a revised version of the Cross-Impact Assessment method to measure the level and trend of technological convergence between 1990 and 2003. We find that the structures of convergence in technological development and standardisation are in general moderately positivly correlated but that there are significant differences on how these converging trends are covered in the stock of active standards at the level of <b>technical</b> <b>fields...</b>|$|R
