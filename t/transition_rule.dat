5|$|There are no nontrivial {{reversible}} elementary cellular automata. However, a near-miss {{is provided}} by Rule 90 and other elementary cellular automata based on the exclusive or function. In Rule 90, the state of each cell is the exclusive or of the previous states of its two neighbors. This use of the exclusive or makes the <b>transition</b> <b>rule</b> locally invertible, {{in the sense that}} any contiguous subsequence of states can be generated by this rule. Rule 90 is not a reversible cellular automaton rule, because in Rule 90 every assignment of states to the complete array of cells has exactly four possible predecessors, whereas reversible rules are required to have exactly one predecessor per configuration.|$|E
5|$|Any {{one-dimensional}} reversible {{cellular automaton}} may be placed into rectangular form, after which its <b>transition</b> <b>rule</b> may be factored into {{the action of}} an idempotent semicentral bigroupoid (a reversible rule for which regions of cells with a single state value change only at their boundaries) together with a permutation {{on the set of}} states. The first-order invariants for the idempotent lifting of the automaton rule (the modified rule formed by omitting the permutation) necessarily behave like the ones for a rectangular band: they have a basis of invariants that flow either leftwards or rightwards at a constant rate without interaction. The first-order invariants for the overall automaton are then exactly the invariants for the idempotent lifting that give equal weight to every pair of states that belong to the same orbit of the permutation. However, the permutation of states in the rule may cause these invariants to behave differently from in the idempotent lifting, flowing non-uniformly and with interactions.|$|E
5|$|Culik {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that a cellular automaton has an injective transition function {{if and only if}} the transition function is injective on the subsets of configurations that are periodic (repeating the same substring infinitely often in both directions). He defines a nondeterministic finite-state transducer that performs the <b>transition</b> <b>rule</b> of the automaton on periodic strings. This transducer works by remembering the neighborhood of the automaton {{at the start of the}} string and entering an accepting state when that neighborhood concatenated to the end of the input would cause its nondeterministically chosen transitions to be correct. Culik then swaps the input and output of the transducer. The transducer resulting from this swap simulates the inverse dynamics of the given automaton. Finally, Culik applies previously known algorithms to test whether the resulting swapped transducer maps each input to a single output.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method to discover knowledge for geographical cellular automata (CA) {{by using a}} data-mining technique. CA {{have the ability to}} simulate complex geographical phenomena. Very few studies have been carried out on how to determine and validate the <b>transition</b> <b>rules</b> of CA from observed data. The <b>transition</b> <b>rules</b> of traditional CA are usually expressed by mathematical equations. This paper demonstrates that the explicit <b>transition</b> <b>rules</b> of CA can be automatically reconstructed through the rule induction procedure of data mining. The explicit <b>transition</b> <b>rules</b> are more intuitive to decision-makers. The <b>transition</b> <b>rules</b> are obtained by applying data-mining techniques to spatial data.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{geographical}} simulation by applying data mining techniques to cellular automata. CA has strong capabilities in simulating complex systems. The core of CA {{is how to}} define <b>transition</b> <b>rules.</b> There are no good methods for defining these <b>transition</b> <b>rules.</b> They are usually defined by using heuristic methods and thus subject to uncertainties. Mathematical equations are used to represent <b>transition</b> <b>rules</b> implicitly and have limitations in capturing complex relationships. This paper demonstrates that the explicit <b>transition</b> <b>rules</b> of CA can be automatically reconstructed through the rule induction procedure of data mining. The proposed method can reduce the influences of individual knowledge and preferences in defining <b>transition</b> <b>rules</b> and generate more reliable simulation results.

5|$|Sutner {{defines a}} {{directed}} graph (a type of de Bruijn graph) {{in which each}} vertex represents a pair of assignments of states for the cells in a contiguous sequence of cells. The length of this sequence is chosen to be one less than the neighborhood size of the automaton. An edge in Sutner's graph represents a pair of sequences of cells that overlap {{in all but one}} cell, so that the union of the sequences is a full neighborhood in the cellular automaton. Each such edge is directed from the overlapping subsequence on the left to the subsequence on the right. Edges are only included in the graph when they represent compatible state assignments on the overlapping parts of their cell sequences, and when the automaton rule (applied to the neighborhood determined by the potential edge) would give the same results for both assignments of states. By performing a linear-time strong connectivity analysis of this graph, it is possible to determine which of its vertices belong to cycles. The <b>transition</b> <b>rule</b> is non-injective if and only if this graph contains a directed cycle in which at least one vertex has two differing state assignments.|$|E

40|$|A new {{intelligent}} algorithm {{of geographical}} cellular automata (CA) based on ant colony optimization (ACO) is proposed in this paper. CA {{is capable of}} simulating the evolution of complex geographical phenomena, and the core of CA models is how to define <b>transition</b> <b>rules.</b> However, most of the <b>transition</b> <b>rules</b> are defined by mathematical equations, and are hence not explicit. When the study area is complicated, {{it is much more}} difficult to extract parameters for geographical CA. As a result, ACO is applied to geographical CA to automatically and intelligently obtain <b>transition</b> <b>rules</b> in this paper. The <b>transition</b> <b>rules</b> extracted by ACO are defined as logical expressions rather than implicit mathematical equations to describe the complex relationships of the nature, and easy for people to understand. The ACO-CA model was applied to simulating rural-urban land conversions in Guangzhou City, China, and appropriate simulation results were generated.

40|$|When a bonus–malus {{system with}} a single set of optimal relativities {{and a set of}} simple <b>transition</b> <b>rules</b> is implemented, two {{inadequacy}} scenarios are induced because all policyholders are subject to the same a posteriori premium relativities (level transitions) independent of their a priori characteristics (current levels occupied). In this paper we propose a new objective function in the determination of optimal relativities that directly incorporates the a priori expected claim frequencies to partially address one of the inadequacy scenarios. We derive the analytical solution for the optimal relativities under a financial equilibrium constraint. Furthermore, we introduce a metric called effectiveness of <b>transition</b> <b>rules</b> to compare the different specifications of <b>transition</b> <b>rules.</b> We also argue that varying <b>transition</b> <b>rules</b> which are more flexible in addressing the other inadequacy scenario may be more effective than their corresponding simple rules. 9 page(s...|$|R
