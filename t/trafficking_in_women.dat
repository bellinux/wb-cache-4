25|$|Ghénia Avril de Sainte-Croix (1855 – 21 March 1939) was a French author, {{journalist}} and feminist. For many years {{she led the}} French branch of the International Abolitionist Federation, which sought to abolish state regulation of prostitution and fought <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>women.</b> She advised the French government and the League of Nations on women's issues. She was vice-president of the International Council of Women from 1920 and President of the National Council of French Women from 1922 to 1932.|$|E

25|$|Discrimination of women: The {{complete}} {{denial of}} the freedoms of expression and association has exacerbated the generally unequal status of women. Food shortage and gender discrimination makes some women especially vulnerable. The male-dominated State preys on both economically advancing women and marginalized women who suffer bribery, sexual assault, and gender violence. Victims are not afforded protection by the State or recourse to justice. Structural problems are also major contributing factors to {{the high levels of}} <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>women</b> and girls who escape from North Korea to China.|$|E
25|$|Her {{leadership}} {{in this area}} was recognized early on by the Italian Government when she was appointed as Co-ordinator of the Italian Inter-ministerial Committee of Government Action against <b>Trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>Women</b> and Children, co-chaired by the Minister for Equal Opportunities and the Minister for Social Solidarity from 1997-2001. In this co-ordinating function, Giammarinaro worked with the National Antimafia Directorate, the Headquarters of the Police, the Carabinieri and Guardia di Finanza, with government agencies and departments, to strengthen the Italian Government’s response to human trafficking, {{as well as to}} improve communication and partnership with civil society organizations and non-governmental organizations.|$|E
25|$|WAP {{became known}} {{because of their}} anti-pornography informational tours of sex shops and pornographic theaters held in Times Square. In the 1980s, WAP began {{to focus more on}} {{lobbying}} and legislative efforts against pornography, particularly in support of civil-rights-oriented antipornography legislation. They were also active in testifying before the Meese Commission and some of their advocacy of a civil-rights based anti-pornography model found its way into the final recommendations of the commission. In the late 1980s, the leadership of WAP changed their focus again, this time more on the issue of international sex trafficking, which led to the founding of the Coalition Against <b>Trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>Women.</b> In the 1990s WAP became less active and eventually faded out of existence in the mid '90s.|$|E

500|$|In March 2013, Falle {{spoke at}} the 57th Session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, where she sat on a panel called [...] "Survivors Speak: Prostitution and Sex Trafficking" [...] that was {{sponsored}} by Coalition Against <b>Trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>Women.</b> That May, Falle spoke at a fundraiser for the Servants Anonymous Society of Calgary, an organization that supports sex workers in the city. It was her first time in Calgary since she {{had been part of}} the sex industry there. The fundraiser was called [...] "Cry of the Streets: An Evening for Freedom" [...] and raised money for Servants Anonymous Facilitates Exit, a women's shelter for those seeking to leave the sex industry. At the fundraiser, Falle advocated adopting a law in Canada analogous to Sweden's Sex Purchase Act, which decriminalized the selling of sex and criminalized pimping and the purchasing of sex. Falle argued in support of modelling prostitution law in Canada after Sweden's laws because she believes that prostitution cannot be regulated. At another time, she had said that [...] "it's not Canada's laws that make prostitution unsafe, it's the johns who are raping and abusing the women and their pimps." [...] Also in 2013, Falle said that the average age at which girls get involved in prostitution in Canada is 14, and that their emotional intelligence does not develop while in prostitution, preventing many of them from leaving. She also said that prostitution has grown significantly in Canada since she left the sex industry, and that most human trafficking victims in Canada were born and raised in Canada.|$|E

2500|$|The Coalition Against <b>Trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>Women</b> has {{reported}} scores of cases where women {{were forced to}} prostitute themselves. [...] "Trafficking in women plagues the United States {{as much as it}} does underdeveloped nations. Organized prostitution networks have migrated from metropolitan areas to small cities and suburbs.

2500|$|The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women classifies {{violence}} against women into three categories: that occurring in the family, that occurring within the general community, and that perpetrated or condoned by the State.

As {{a result of this}} conference, Leidholdt felt it would be more productive to focus on combatting the international sex industry, and founded the Coalition Against <b>Trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>Women</b> (CATW) for that purpose.

2500|$|In 1993, in his {{encyclical}} Veritatis Splendor, John Paul II took, from Vatican II's pastoral constitution on the Church in {{the modern}} world, {{a long list of}} social evils: “homicide, genocide, abortion, euthanasia and voluntary suicide ... mutilation, physical and mental torture and attempts to coerce the spirit; whatever is offensive to human dignity, such as sub-human living conditions, arbitrary imprisonments, deportation, slavery, prostitution and <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>women</b> and children; degrading conditions of work which treat laborers as mere instruments of profit, and not as free responsible persons.” Where Vatican II had called these practices “shameful” (probra), John Paul II calls them “intrinsically evil.” In the same encyclical the pope teaches that intrinsically evil acts are prohibited always and everywhere, without any exception.|$|E
