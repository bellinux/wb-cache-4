5|$|Of the A$1.17 billion {{allocated}} to <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>track</b> program, only A$143 million {{was required to}} fix problems where the submarines did not correspond with the original contract: the rest was used to update components that were technologically obsolete and make changes to the submarines beyond the contract specifications. When <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>track</b> program is factored in, the Collins class cost just under 20% more than the inflation-adjusted contract value; a smaller increase than other contemporary defence projects.|$|E
5|$|Several {{newspaper}} articles and commentators have incorrectly {{claimed that the}} project ran significantly over the contract cost. As of {{the launch of the}} first submarine, the project cost had increased from A$3.892 billion in 1986 dollars to A$4.989 billion in 1993 dollars, which corresponded to the rate of inflation during that period. By 2006, A$5.071 billion had been spent to build the submarines (excluding <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>track</b> program); after taking inflation into account, the project had run less than A$40 million over contract.|$|E
5|$|The {{periscopes}} {{also had}} problems with their optics: periscope users reported difficulty in refocusing after changing magnification, duplication of images, and bands across the field of vision. These problems were attributed to RAN demands that the optical view be the first exposed when a periscope was raised above the water, instead of placing the infrared sensor and single-pulse radar at the head as on other submarines, requiring the optical path to be routed around these components. The periscopes were gradually improved, and were no longer a problem by the time <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>track</b> submarines entered service.|$|E

Shackleford had just enough left to withstand the furious late rush of Caleb's Posse, stopping the clock in 1:33 1/5 over <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>track</b> to win by a nose. Favorite To Honor and Serve was another three and half lengths back in third. With this win, Shackleford turned the tables on old rival Caleb's Posse, who beat him in the 2011 Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile. The horses met each other four times, with each winning two races. However, Caleb's Posse retired soon after the Met Mile.|$|E

Austria-1 and Slovakia-1 also crashed out in the first run, and neither sled started the second run, nor did Russia-2. Second run crashes involved USA-2, Great Britain-1, and Japan-1. USA-2 did not participate in the 3rd run of the event. Lange, the defending Olympic champion, also had <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> two start times in the final two runs and <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>track</b> time in <b>the</b> final run while Holcomb had <b>the</b> <b>fastest</b> <b>track</b> time in <b>the</b> third run.

In the final race of his career, Lange did not win a gold medal in an Olympic bobsledding event.

25|$|With {{air traffic}} {{congestion}} reaching an unacceptable threshold in Mumbai, the AAI put its age-old plan of reviving the Juhu airport on <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>track</b> to ease some pressure off of Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (CSIA) in 2010. The AAI appointed consulting major KPMG {{to draw up a}} development plan for Juhu airport. It was envisioned that the Juhu airstrip could take up to 18% load off CSI Airport with turboprop ATR and Boeing 737 aircraft. The plan was to extend the runway to 2000 meters in phases, this would have ultimately seen the airstrip jutting into the sea and utilizing reclaimed parts of the Juhu beach and seafront. Permission for the expansion was denied by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2010. Instead, the ministry asked for conservation of the land around the airstrip, stating that no development should take place there and that it should be conserved as a green space to compensate for the pollution caused by the airstrip.|$|E
25|$|Gene Autry, former movie cowboy, singer, {{actor and}} owner of Golden West Broadcasters (including Los Angeles' KMPC radio and KTLA television), {{attended}} the Major League Owners' meeting in St. Louis in 1960 in hopes of winning broadcasting rights for the new team's games. Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg was initially on <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>track</b> to be the team's first owner, with Bill Veeck as a partner. However, when O'Malley got word of Veeck's involvement, he invoked his exclusive right to operate a major league team in Southern California. In truth, O'Malley wasn't about to compete with Veeck, who {{was known as a}} master promoter. After it became obvious that O'Malley would never sign off on the deal as long as Veeck was a part-owner, Greenberg was forced to bow out. After another bid by Chicago insurance executive and future A's owner Charlie Finley failed, Autry was persuaded to make a bid himself. Autry (who had been a minority stockholder in the Angels' PCL rival, the Hollywood Stars) agreed, and purchased the franchise.|$|E

Mark Protosevich was hired to write the script after the studio was impressed with his spec script of The Cell. Protosevich's first draft took place in 2000 in San Francisco, and contained many similarities with the finished film, though the Darkseekers (called 'Hemocytes') were civilized {{to the point of}} the creatures in The Omega Man and Anna was a lone morphine addict, as well as the fact that a Hemocyte character named Christopher joined forces with Neville.

500|$|In 1996, Rockwell {{sold its}} {{military}} and aerospace division, including {{responsibility for the}} Collins combat system, to Boeing. Boeing attempted to produce a workable combat system, but believed that this could only be done if the changes in technology were accounted for in a contract alteration, which the RAN and the Australian Government initially refused to do. Boeing then requested assistance from Raytheon, and after further negotiations with the Government resulted in a reduction of the system capabilities, the companies were able to stabilise the system and deliver Release 2.0 {{at the end of}} 1999. Boeing sold its naval systems division to Raytheon in May 2000, making the latter company solely responsible for completion of the combat system. After this, the submarine project began investigating ideas for a new combat system. Because there was not enough time to evaluate the replacement system to include it in the [...] "fast track" [...] program, Dechaineux and Sheean were fitted with the old Rockwell combat system, which was enhanced by the addition of sub-systems developed during the early 1980s for the Oberon-class mid-life upgrade and commercial off-the-shelf components. Even with the enhanced system, it was believed that the capabilities of <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>track</b> Collins boats was at best equivalent to the Oberons.|$|E
