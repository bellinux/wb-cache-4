Experimental data, however, can never prove that the hypotheses (h) is true, but relies on an inductive inference by measuring the probability of the hypotheses relative to the empirical data. <b>The</b> <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the rational demonstration of using the logic of inference, math, testing, and deductive reasoning of significance.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> {{two parts}} (Arrow, 1963, pp. 97-100). The first part {{considers}} the hypothetical case of some one voter's ordering that prevails ('is decisive') {{as to the}} social choice for some pair of social states no matter what that voter's preference for the pair, despite all other voters opposing. It is shown that, for a constitution satisfying Unrestricted Domain, Pareto and Independence, that voter's ordering would prevail for every pair of social states, {{no matter what the}} orderings of others. So, the voter would be a Dictator. Thus, Nondictatorship requires postulating that no one would so prevail for even one pair of social states.|$|E

Hawkins then calls Smith again, and demands a favor, threatening to end their relationship if he does not do as asked. Mimi is having Trish reconstruct the data that proves that Goetz was embezzling money from the company, and e-mail it to an address which Trish recognizes as belonging to the Director of Operations for J&R.|$|E
5000|$|The {{anthropologist}} Paul Rabinow {{wrote a book}} on {{the history}} of the PCR method in 1996 (entitled Making PCR) in which he discussed whether or not Mullis [...] "invented" [...] PCR or [...] "merely" [...] came up with the concept of it. Rabinow, a Foucault scholar interested in issues of the production of knowledge, used the topic to argue against the idea that scientific discovery is the product of individual work, writing, [...] "Committees and science journalists like the idea of associating a unique idea with a unique person, the lone genius. PCR is thought by some to be an example of teamwork, but by others as the genius of one who was smart enough to put things together which were present to all, but overlooked. For Mullis, the light bulb went off, but for others it did not. This is consistent with the idea, that the prepared (educated) mind who is careful to observe and not overlook, is what separates the genius scientist from his many also smart scientists. <b>The</b> <b>proof</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the fact that the person who has the light bulb go off never forgets the Ah experience, while the others never had this photochemical reaction go off in their brains." ...|$|E
