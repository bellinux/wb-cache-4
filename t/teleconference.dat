5|$|The Season {{began on}} November 9, with a Depression hitting Tamil Nadu. Rainfall begin {{pour in the}} places of Nellore and Chittor district. Tirumala getting a heavy {{rainfall}} of 309mm along with Tirupathi with 148mm in 24 hours triggered a flood situation in Chittoor District. Coastal places of Tada recorded 114mm of rainfall the same day. There were 3-4 good spells of rain between 9th and 15th. As rainfall began in Andhra Pradesh on 16 November, local authorities closed schools in Nellore district. Heavy rain of about 27cm pounded the temple town of Tirupathi. Thousands of lakes and ponds across the district overflowed, with breaches reported in some areas. At Sri Kalahasti, a pilgrimage centre in the region, the Swarnamukhi River {{was reported to be}} rising. Three people were swept away by floodwaters in Chittoor district, and water entered some houses. Roads were damaged in many parts of Nellore district, disrupting transport services. Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu held a <b>teleconference</b> with the district collectors of affected districts and asked disaster response personnel to be on alert.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of using nuclear weapons in Korea at a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting on 9 July 1950 at Eisenhower's instigation, but there was no support for the idea. The Army staff sent a cable to Collins in Tokyo suggesting that he seek out MacArthur's opinion. In a <b>teleconference</b> on 13 July, Major General Charles L. Bolte proposed sending nuclear weapons. MacArthur had already turned down Air Force proposals to fire bomb North Korean cities, and suggested that atomic bombs could be used to isolate North Korea by taking out bridges and tunnels. The Army staff considered this impractical. However, on 28 July, the Joint Chiefs decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 bombers of the 9th Bombardment Wing to Guam as a deterrent to Chinese action against Taiwan. Truman publicly denied that he was considering the use of nuclear weapons in Korea, but authorised the transfer to Guam of atomic bombs without their fissile cores. The deployment did not go well; one of the bombers crashed on takeoff from Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base in California on 5 August, killing the mission commander, Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, and 18 others. The remaining nine bombers remained in Guam until 13 September, when they returned to the United States. The bomb assemblies stayed behind.|$|E

40|$|Globally {{there is}} a {{shortage}} in supply of rural health professionals. Tele-health was developed to help reduce distance barriers for health professionals in geographically isolated locations seeking continued medical education (CME). E-health includes all health information and health care delivered electronically. Further, telehealth defines all telecommunication technology used to transfer health information and health care. Tele-health comes in a variety of forms including videoconferencing. The use of videoconferencing to deliver medical education for rural health professionals is expanding area for health education. Videoconferencing provides a flexible method for rural GP registrars to access CME without travel. However, there is limited knowledge surrounding the use and success of telehealth for medical education. Each new telehealth project requires evaluation in order to ensure effectiveness of future programs. This study was based on one General Practice Education Year One (GPEP- 1) registrar training program trialling videoconferencing as a method of teaching rurally distant registrars. A qualitative health research thematic analysis was undertaken. All individuals involved in the study were included in this research including; three offsite registrars (who <b>teleconferenced</b> as they lived remotely from the seminars), three onsite registrars (who attended the face to face seminars), and three facilitators. Three focus group interviews were conducted to collect data, one for each respective group. The focus groups accounted for the participant’s individual and collective experience of <b>teleconferencing.</b> Seven main themes emerged from the focus groups including; group culture, facilitation, <b>teleconferenced</b> education, technology, personal priorities, travel, and rural/remote. These themes were further sorted into two groups; reasons for switching to <b>teleconferencing</b> and factors that determine {{the success or failure of}} a telehealth CME. The factors that influenced the offsite registrars reasons to switch to <b>teleconferencing</b> included; personal priorities, travel, and rural/ remote. Further, the other four themes determined the success or failure of the <b>teleconferenced</b> training including; group culture, facilitation, <b>teleconferenced</b> education, and technology. All seven themes were relevant for the offsite registrars and onsite registrars, however, for the facilitators only the factors that determined the success of <b>teleconferencing</b> were applicable. Overall, the pilot study there was no difference in the educational experience provided. This study outlined the key factors that are required for effective <b>teleconferenced</b> training including; face to face bonding prior to <b>teleconferencing,</b> a skilled facilitator that provides active facilitation, a well organised structure, good quality technology, and regular checkups with the learners <b>teleconferencing</b> to ensure satisfaction.
