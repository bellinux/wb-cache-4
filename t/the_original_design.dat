5|$|<b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>design</b> of the Singapore Power Building was {{executed}} virtually without later alteration {{although it would}} later be surrounded by hotels, the Somerset MRT Station and shopping complexes.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebuilding}} solved most of {{the maintenance}} problems whilst retaining the excellent features of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>design.</b> Repair costs were reduced by up to 60%, and coal consumption was reduced by up to 8.4%. However the Walschaerts valve gear made the rebuilds heavier and prone to hammerblow on the track, a complaint that was not evident with <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>design.</b> The increased weight reduced their route availability, meaning {{that they could not}} be used on certain routes available to un-rebuilt examples, such as the line to Ilfracombe.|$|E
50|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>designs,</b> <b>the</b> Keesonic Kub was {{launched}} in the early 1980s.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>designs</b> {{featured}} trains with {{a safety}} system consisting of over-the-shoulder restraints. These restraints would lock into {{place with a}} belt-type connector which would be attached the seat base. All of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> track <b>designs</b> were of the 342m model with concrete footers.|$|R
5|$|On 24 April 2017, rumours of Creative Assembly {{producing}} a sequel were published by PSU.com. However, Eurogamer later {{pointed out that}} the rumour is likely false, as much of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>design</b> team behind Alien: Isolation were no longer with Creative Assembly.|$|E
5|$|The last {{significant}} extension {{was added}} in 1920, {{which was designed}} by the Luttrell Brothers. The south-east wing was much more in keeping with <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>design.</b> It {{is possible that the}} architects designed a second storey for the service wing that had been built in 1889. This extension connected the original house with the original washhouse.|$|E
5|$|While {{connector}} interfaces can {{be designed}} to allow plugging with either orientation, <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>design</b> omitted such functionality to decrease manufacturing costs. The reversible type-C plug is an addition to the USB3.1 specification comparable in size to the Micro-B SuperSpeed connector.|$|E

5|$|After {{attempts}} to persuade Muchlisin to keep <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>design</b> fail, Sakera overhears {{that the house}} is on disputed land. Maida uses the information, as well as feedback from a traditional musical group distantly related to Pahing, {{to discover that the}} house has a secret underground bunker, in which she and Sakera– with whom she has begun to fall in love– find documents showing the history of the house. With the help of her mother's former lover Kuan (Henky Solaiman), she discovers the true ownership of the house.|$|E
5|$|At six storeys, the Great Southern Hotel was {{the first}} Chinese hotel to have a lift. <b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>design</b> {{accommodated}} offices on the first storey, the hotel on {{the second and third}} storeys, a restaurant on the fifth storey, and a tea house on the roof terrace as well as a cabaret. The restaurant on the fourth floor was later converted into the owner's office. The whole of the fifth floor was occupied by a then-well-known cabaret, the Southern Cabaret. Shops and entertainment outlets, including a Hainanese kopitiam, were situated on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Block I (RS-25B) – First flown on STS-70, the Block I engines offered {{improved}} turbopumps featuring ceramic bearings, {{half as many}} {{rotating parts}} and a new casting process {{reducing the number of}} welds. Block I improvements also included a new, two-duct powerhead (rather than <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>design,</b> which featured three ducts connected to the HPFTP and two to the HPOTP), which helped improve hot gas flow, and an improved engine heat exchanger.|$|E

5|$|Both {{carriers}} will {{be completed}} as originally planned, in a Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) configuration, deploying the Lockheed Martin F-35B. Following the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the British government had intended to purchase the F-35C carrier version of this aircraft, and adopted plans for Prince of Wales to be built to a Catapult Assisted Take Off Barrier Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) configuration. After the projected costs of the CATOBAR system rose to around twice the original estimate, the government {{announced that it would}} revert to <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>design</b> on 10 May 2012.|$|E
5|$|Designed at British Railways' Derby Works, the {{new class}} was {{constructed}} at British Railways' Crewe Works between 1951 and 1954. The initial order was for 25 locomotives, but {{such was the}} demand for the Britannias on the Eastern Region that more were rushed through construction before the teething problems had been ironed out on the prototypes. In total, 55 {{members of the class}} were constructed over three batches at Crewe Works, where each was given improvements to improve reliability and efficiency, and to overcome flaws with <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
5|$|Each {{aircraft}} {{requires a}} month-long packaged maintenance plan (PMP) every 300 flight hours. The stealth system, including its radar absorbing metallic skin, account for almost {{one third of}} maintenance. The canopy was redesigned after <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>design</b> lasted an average of 331 hours instead of the required 800 hours. F-22 depot maintenance is performed at Ogden Air Logistics Complex at Hill AFB, Utah.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted in the flashbacks Iris and Molly's {{appearances}} are identical to <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>designs</b> of Kei and Yuri respectively.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>designs</b> {{featured}} {{unusually high}} speed for a cargo ship (16-19 knots), {{as well as}} 6 luxury rooms for 2 occupants each.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>designs</b> {{included}} a crossing tower and transepts, {{but these were}} not completed. A lady chapel and parish hall were added in 1967.|$|R
5|$|Nothing {{remains of}} the {{original}} dome built by Abd al-Malik. The present-day dome was built by az-Zahir and consists of wood plated with lead enamelwork. In 1969, the dome was reconstructed in concrete and covered with anodized aluminum, instead of the original ribbed lead enamel work sheeting. In 1983, the aluminum outer covering was replaced with lead to match <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>design</b> by az-Zahir.|$|E
5|$|The CBS {{document}} {{states that}} the first national flag was designed upon the request of Jigme Wangchuk, the second Druk Gyalpo of the 20th-century Kingdom of Bhutan, and was introduced in 1949 during {{the signing of the}} Indo-Bhutan Treaty. While the document does not provide an illustration of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>design,</b> black-and-white photographs taken at this historic event provide images of the first Bhutanese flag at the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The M19 was {{developed}} from the T65 {{which was based on}} the M5 light tank chassis. <b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>design</b> was improved upon and designated the T65E1. It was accepted into service in May 1944 as the M19 MGMC, equipping several U.S. Army anti-aircraft units during World War II. The M19A1 was an improved variant with an auxiliary engine and spare barrels for the 40mm Bofors guns.|$|E
50|$|In 2011 Flirtomatic was re-designed as <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>designs</b> {{primarily}} targeted {{young people}} - {{but in order}} to generate revenue, especially older people were needed.|$|R
50|$|After Schering-Plough {{had bought}} Coppertone, <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>designs</b> {{were lost in}} a fire.In 1959 Joyce Ballantyne Brand recreated the now iconic Coppertone Girl artwork with very minor changes.|$|R
5000|$|Many of the repaints {{taken from}} the Armada line had remolded parts retro-fitted to <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>designs</b> so their Mini-con {{features}} would now use a planet key instead.|$|R
5|$|The Mary Rose was {{substantially}} rebuilt in 1536. The 1536 rebuilding {{turned a}} ship of 500 tons {{into one of}} 700 tons, and added an entire extra tier of broadside guns to the old carrack-style structure. By consequence, modern research is based mostly on interpretations of the concrete physical evidence of {{this version of the}} Mary Rose. The construction of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>design</b> from 1509 is less known.|$|E
5|$|The ball's {{design has}} been updated {{over the years}} to reflect {{improvements}} in lighting technology; <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>design</b> was made from wood and iron and lit with 100 incandescent light bulbs, while its current incarnation, designed by Harlem-based architectural lighting firm Focus Lighting, features a computerized LED lighting system and an outer surface consisting of triangle-shaped crystal panels. Since 2009, the current ball has been displayed atop the building year-round, while the original, smaller version of the current ball that was used in 2008 is on display at Times Square's visitor center.|$|E
5|$|The {{coaching}} stock was extremely solidly constructed, and offered levels of accommodation {{far in advance}} of anything else at the time - certainly compared to any other narrow gauge railway. Almost 70 years later, the design {{was used as the}} basis for a new rake of carriages built by the Ffestiniog - testament to the excellence of <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1930, a new {{surgical}} wing {{was begun}} by architects, Kaminker & Richmond. <b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>designs</b> were drawn up in 1928 by Benjamin Swartz. The project was only completed in 1934.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, {{the company}} changed logos from <b>the</b> <b>original,</b> <b>designed</b> in 2000 by Toni Kuokkanen to a new, more modern logo, {{and removed the}} camelCase of the product and company name.|$|R
50|$|Common {{departures from}} <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>designs</b> include {{omission}} {{of the internal}} resonator, addition of a scratchplate, the use of solid (non-laminated) woods and building D-hole models with a 14th fret neck-join rather than <b>the</b> <b>original</b> 12th fret join.|$|R
