50|$|Dollaseite-(Ce) {{can occur}} {{in a number of}} locations, but the most {{prominent}} is at Ostanmossa, Sweden. The type of dollaseite-(Ce) <b>that</b> <b>can</b> generally <b>be</b> <b>found</b> at this location tends to be Fe-poor and occurs in tremolite skarn. The fact <b>that</b> dollaseite-(Ce) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> prominently <b>found</b> in Sweden comes as no surprise since Sweden has been known to host many REE epidote-group minerals such as dissakisite-(Ce) and allanite-(Ce). Another dollaseite-(Ce) specimen with composition slightly similar to <b>that</b> of dissakisite-(Ce) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in rock composed of fluorite and fluorian phlogopite.|$|R

5|$|An {{example for}} the fission and fusion {{mechanism}} {{can be found in}} nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases. These are membrane-bound enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a hydride ion between NAD(H) and NADP(H) in a reaction that is coupled to transmembrane proton translocation. They consist of three major functional units (I, II, and III) <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in different arrangement in bacteria, protozoa, and higher eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the three groups of domain arrangements were acquired and fused independently.|$|E
5|$|For {{artifacts}} {{such as the}} Sky Disc of Nebra, {{alleged to}} be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the cosmos, the analysis {{would be similar to}} typical post-excavation analysis as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology. An artefact is examined and attempts are made to draw analogies with historical or ethnographical records of other peoples. The more parallels <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found,</b> the more likely an explanation is to be accepted by other archaeologists.|$|E

The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number of stars <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in globular clusters. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger—several hundred light-years across—and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters.|$|E

5|$|Uranium is a {{naturally}} occurring element <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. Uranium is the 51st element {{in order of}} abundance in the Earth's crust. Uranium is also the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on Earth and is almost always found combined with other elements. The decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium-40 in the Earth's mantle {{is thought to be}} the main source of heat that keeps the outer core liquid and drives mantle convection, which in turn drives plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to finding weaponry {{out in the}} wastelands, the player can also create their own. To craft such weapons, the player must use a workbench, possess either the necessary schematics or the right Perk, and scavenge for the items needed to make them. These weapons usually possess significant advantages over other weapons of their type. Each weapon's schematic has three copies <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found,</b> and possessing additional copies improves the condition (or number) of items produced at the workbench, while a higher repair skill {{will result in a}} better starting condition for the related weapon. Weapon schematics can be found lying in certain locations, bought from vendors, or received as quest rewards.|$|E
5|$|Many {{recently}} developed SGDs include performance measurement and analysis tools to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns about privacy, and {{some argue that}} the device user {{should be involved in}} the decision to monitor use in this way. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs. As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of personal data management problems <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs may have to be designed so that they support the user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that has been added automatically.|$|E

5|$|Most Stylidium species {{tend to be}} hardy {{species and}} can be easily {{cultivated}} in greenhouses or gardens. They are drought resistant, hardy to cold weather, and the species diversity in this genus gives gardeners {{a wide variety of}} choices. Most species that are native to Western Australia will be cold hardy to at least -1 to -2°C. The few <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> all over Australia, like S. graminifolium, will tolerate a wider range of habitat since their native ranges includes a great diversity of ecoregions. Some species of triggerplants are suitable for cultivation outdoors outside of the Australian continent including most of the United Kingdom and as far north as New York City or Seattle in the United States.|$|E

The visitor center is the start of many guided tours of the refuge and it is home to exhibits that discuss the history of Jamaica Bay, the wide array of wildlife <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> there, and the impact of human activity.|$|E
5|$|Sarawak can {{be divided}} into two {{geological}} zones: the Sunda Shield, which extends southwest from the Batang Lupar River (near Sri Aman) and forms the southern tip of Sarawak, and the geosyncline region, which extends northeast to the Batang Lupar River, forming the central and northern regions of Sarawak. The oldest rock type in southern Sarawak is schist formed during the Carboniferous and Lower Permian times, while the youngest igneous rock in this region, andesite, can be found at Sematan. Geological formation of the central and northern regions started during the late Cretaceous period. Other types of stone <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in central and northern Sarawak are shale, sandstone, and chert.|$|E
