The book Hell and High Water asserts that there has been a disingenuous, concerted and effective campaign to convince Americans that the science is not proven, or that global warming is the result of natural cycles, and that there needs to be more research. The book claims that, to delay action, industry and government spokesmen suggest falsely that [...] "technology breakthroughs" [...] will eventually save us with hydrogen cars and other fixes. It calls on voters to demand immediate government action to curb emissions. Papers presented at an International Scientific Congress on Climate Change, held in 2009 under the sponsorship of the University of Copenhagen in cooperation with nine other universities in the International Alliance of Research Universities (IARU), maintained that the climate change skepticism that is so prevalent in the USA [...] "was largely generated and kept alive by a small number of conservative think tanks, often with direct funding from industries having special interests in delaying or avoiding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions".|$|E

40|$|During {{his tenure}} as President, George W. Bush has pushed a {{domestic}} policy agenda that strongly advocates reducing the burdens on business, allegedly caused by regulations that have been deemed too punitive and too expensive by the Administration and its allies. This policy shift has taken place within most agencies responsible for administering social and economic regulation, but environmental regulation {{has been the most}} salient and visible example of the Administration’s attempt to roll back enforcement activities. In particular, administration officials have spent much time trying to rewrite the New Source Review rules under the Clean Air Act, specifically to ensure that power plants and other energy concerns would not have to spend potentially billions on anti-pollution control when they upgrade their facilities. With strong efforts like these, to make regulation more business-friendly, it is natural to expect that enforcement activities in the EPA would decline during the Bush Administration. However, this conclusion may be premature, given previous research on this subject.

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the policies of}} the Bush Administration, and the damage that it has done to the cause of democracy and human rights worldwide.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>{{administration}}</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{criticized for}} departures from {{the rule of}} law, but within the administration law was not ignored. Instead it was seen variously as a tool and as a potential threat to {{the operation of the}} executive branch. Two narratives compete for attention. In an era when the legality of torture was openly debated, the deployment of law in wartime seemed the most immediate issue. At the same time, however, a decades-long conservative movement to change American law was both significantly furthered and complicated, as Supreme Court appointments moved the Court to the right, but the lack of a common jurisprudence hampered the consolidation of a new conservative constitutional vision. More conservative courts might seem a safe haven for the president, less likely to challenge executive branch actions, but the Bush administration had a complicated relationship with courts. The administration sought out the courts to further aspects of a social policy agenda, such as restricting abortion rights and gun control. But when it came to challenges to the executive branch itself, the Administration used creative means to avoid court jurisdiction, including constitutional theories about executive power. Law was both a sword and a shield: it was a tool used to further some conservative objectives, and it was a shield intended to protect executive autonomy...|$|E

40|$|While Central Asia {{has become}} an {{important}} military operation theater in the U.

As in the past years <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> widely criticized for being unilateral and militaristic in its foreign policy practices, this study will analyze American policies toward Central Asia, focusing on its tendency to allow security concerns and military thinking have precedence over other considerations. This unbalanced strategy has led to a narrow-minded militaristic approach which does not support the stated democratization goals of American foreign policies toward the region; instead it only appears designed to meet military expediency needs. A brief overview of the evolution of American policies toward the region is laid out first, and then the dilemmas encountered by the U. S. in seeking its best interests in the region are discussed. In recognizing the importance of Central Asia in U. S. national security strategy, this research indicates that the military component should play only a comparatively a small role in the overall American effort in dealing with the states in the region. If the military expediency, coupled with geopolitical considerations, is continuously favored, such practice will hurt U.

40|$|This article asserts {{the thesis}} that {{customary}} international law (CIL), {{even in the absence}} of any new treaty, already provides a legal regime constraining the testing and use in combat of anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons. This argument, if validated, is important for both legal and public policy considerations: the world (especially, but not only, the United States) has grown increasingly dependent upon satellites for the performance of a wide array of commercial and military functions. At the same time, because of this growing reliance (and hence vulnerability), interest has surged in developing novel systems for attacking a potential enemy’s satellites – ASAT technology has been tested by the United States, Russia, and China, and other countries may soon shoot up that same dangerous trajectory. Oddly, the United States has consistently opposed international efforts to negotiate an arms control solution to this problem. Any comprehensive treaty would certainly be difficult to reach (there are numerous complicated issues of definitions, scope, and verification to surmount) but the American stance (not only during <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration)</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> that we should not even try, because 2 ̆ 2 there is currently no arms race occurring in outer space. 2 ̆ 2 This article turns that resistance on its head, by asking whether customary international law, even without any formal treaty on point, already imposes meaningful constraints upon ASAT activities. To develop the argument, it analyzes three strands of CIL: first, “general” customary international law, which has long been recognized as an authoritative, albeit complex, source of binding rules; second, the specialized legal regime incorporated into the law of armed conflict, which imposes its own strictures, fully applicable to conventional warfare, but not yet applied extra-terrestrially; and finally, another realm of specialized CIL, the emerging jurisprudence governing international environmental law. My conclusion is that there is already a meaningful ASAT-control regime, created by CIL even without codification in a new treaty. This is not, to be sure, a fully comprehensive legal web, and there would still be plenty of additional scope for a new treaty to enhance and extend the legal regime. But the conclusion is that treaty negotiators would not be drafting on a complete tabula rasa; an incipient legal order is already in place...|$|E
40|$|The {{plight of}} the Pacific Salmon has been fervidly {{researched}} over {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century by scientists and environmentalists searching for an explanation behind the declining populations of these once vibrant species. While this sustained research has yet to reveal one specific causative factor, advancing technologies and intensive studies have supported the emergence of a new consensus, one that accepts the proposition that an aggregation of man made factors has inflicted the most damage upon Pacific Salmon and their habitats. While some biological and environmental factors have no doubt helped perpetuate the decline of Pacific Salmon populations, a growing body of science now pinpoints manmade pressures as the major source of salmon habitat degradation. The Pacific Northwest historically supported one of the densest populations in pre-industrial North America, due in large part to once plentiful Pacific Salmon populations. As recently as the early twentieth century, salmon populations remained plenteous, serving as a critical food staple for struggling families during the Great Depression. However, a multitude of factors-including overfishing, dam building, extensive logging, urbanization, and increases in hatchery-born salmon populations-have contributed to the recent declines in Pacific Salmon populations. Scientists and environmentalists have now uncovered another deadly man-made influence contributing to this population decline-pesticides. While the political quagmire surrounding Pacific Salmon has dominated local and state politics for years, pesticide use issues and the related dangers of pesticide contamination have only recently taken center stage-both locally and nationally. Salmon and politics are intertwined, especially in the Pacific Northwest, where the maintenance of healthy, functional salmon habitats has sparked ardent political debate at every level of government. The emerging national debate mirrors the competing factions on the local level-pitting pro-private land use and agriculture interest groups touting economic land use benefits over environmental protection, while environmentalist and conservationist groups voice growing concerns over the current administration 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to environmental protection. President George W. Bush has been assailed with accusations of attempting to further undermine the already tenuous safeguards intended to protect endangered species, like the Pacific Salmon, by justifying policy decisions based on 2 ̆ 2 rigged science, 2 ̆ 2 and by defying court orders to sidestep the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and its pro-environment protective measures. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> accused of acquiescing to the pesticide industry by proposing and supporting pro-pesticide administrative rules. At the state level, Washington has enacted proactive executive and legislative measures to ameliorate the problem of salmon habitat degradation, including the establishment of the Governor 2 ̆ 7 s Statewide Strategy to Recover Salmon, and the enactment of the Watershed Management Act. The salmon debate has also spurred local grass roots support, such as a 2001 referendum-driven Seattle ordinance that sought to protect salmon watersheds. The ordinance required implementation of more effective water conservation techniques, such as retrofitting low income housing with efficient water conservation devices, and required the city to increase water conservation by twelve million gallons per day by 2010. Most of the aforementioned political debate and resulting legislation emanates from the deep cultural significance and iconic status of the Pacific Salmon, and thus the value of the sustained existence of these species cannot be easily quantified, either economically or culturally. This 2 ̆ 2 concurrent 2 ̆ 2 value is a main instigator for the diligent conservation efforts that have been waged by both local and federal environmental groups, as well as fishing industry lobbyists. Conversely, the Northwest relies heavily on the manipulation of water, an obvious and critical component of salmon habitats, to support the region 2 ̆ 7 s rapidly expanding population. For example, hydroelectric power dams provide nearly ninety percent of the region 2 ̆ 7 s electricity. Additionally, the logging industry, agriculture, and private land-users all rely on water to varying degrees for economic sustenance and have contributed excessive resources to fight state and federal regulations aimed at protecting salmon and their habitats. The competing interests at stake in the salmon conservation movement depict the all too familiar dilemma of the economic interests of the private landowner/business owner versus environmental and conservation interests. Part II of this Comment will briefly outline the historical, cultural and economic significance of Pacific Salmon and the multitude of values inherent in a healthy maintenance of the species. Part III will focus on the current federal pesticide regulatory framework, as well as federal efforts to protect salmon and their habitats under the ESA. More precisely, attention will be given to the ESA procedural guidelines for safeguarding salmon and their habitats and the problematic position of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in balancing ESA responsibilities with the duty to regulate domestic pesticide use under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). After analyzing the procedural mechanisms available to guide interagency cooperation to protect endangered species and their habitats, Part IV will explore the Pacific Salmon as an endangered species, the protections that the ESA should afford to salmon with an ESA listing, and the level and effects of pesticides in vital salmon habitats across the Northwest. Furthermore, the discussion in Part V will examine potential remedies to the procedural deficiencies and ineffective regime as implemented to regulate domestic pesticide use. A center point of this discussion will include analysis of recent federal court orders imposing restrictions on certain pesticide use in close proximity to salmon harboring watersheds. In the matter of Washington Toxics Coalition v. EPA, environmental groups and fishing industry activists challenged EPA 2 ̆ 7 s ineffectiveness and failure to implement ESA mandated safety measures to prevent harmful pesticides from polluting critical salmon habitats. Pesticide industry intervenors joined EPA in an attempt to impede the implementation of more rigid pesticide regulations, but round one of the litigation was a victory for environmentalists. Lastly, Part VI of this Comment will examine the possible future of domestic pesticide regulation and the likely effects of such regulation on business, private landowners, and the environment...|$|E
