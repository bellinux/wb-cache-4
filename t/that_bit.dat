40|$|The study {{constructs}} {{a linear}} model {{to evaluate the}} significant impacts of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) on foreign direct investment (FDI) and the possible consequences of BITs. The results show <b>that</b> <b>BITs</b> have significantly promoted FDI, and their effects are substitute for the level of political risk in a country. Another interesting finding is <b>that</b> <b>BITs</b> signed with non-OECD countries should not be overlooked. By estimating the growth of FDI resulting from an additional BIT ratified, the finding further indicates <b>that</b> <b>BITs</b> are more potential for most Asian countries to promote FDI. On average, a BIT ratified by a country in South, East, and South-East Asia can raise FDI by around 2. 3 percent. ...|$|R
25|$|Frequency (subcarrier) {{interleaving}} increases {{resistance to}} frequency-selective channel {{conditions such as}} fading. For example, when {{a part of the}} channel bandwidth fades, frequency interleaving ensures <b>that</b> the <b>bit</b> errors <b>that</b> would result from those subcarriers in the faded part of the bandwidth are spread out in the bit-stream rather than being concentrated.

Wright inherited a strong team that already included the aforementioned stars, then added key freshmen Ally Perdios and Jess Greenwood, along with Penn State transfer Paige Harrington, to the fray.

An impressive journey at the ACHA National Tournament in Ashburn, Virginia followed, with an opening 3–2 win over 2011 national champ Michigan State, as second-period goals from Oteri, Labossiere and Chelsea Bräm turned around an early 2–0 deficit. Although Northeastern took an ECWHL final rematch in the day one nightcap (the first day of the tournament involved two pool games played by each team at the time), two more Oteri goals delivered a vital 2–1 victory over Robert Morris (IL) that, along with tiebreaker help, sent UMass through to the semifinals for the third time in program history. Once there, however, eventual champ Minnesota jumped on the Minutemen for three goals in the first ten minutes of the contest en route to a 5–1 result.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) has paid an increasing interest to international institutions such as bilateral investment treaties (BITs), but whether BITs help attract FDI is an unsettled question. Building on the exist¬ing literature, this article argues <b>that</b> <b>BITs</b> can change investors’ perceptions and the corresponding investment they make because signing BITs signals the involvement of another powerful country that is able to compel the host government to comply. This implies {{that the effect of}} BITs is not constant across signatory countries: BITs are more effective when they are signed with rich and influential countries. Using monadic and dyadic FDI data, this article finds <b>that</b> <b>BITs</b> signed with powerful countries (defined as the top six largest economies) lead to an increase in FDI inflows (both from these signatory countries and from other countries).
