5000|$|... 1989 - Digidesign {{launches}} {{the first}} digital audio workstation system, Sound Tools, for the Apple Macintosh. The company refers {{to it as}} [...] "the first <b>tapeless</b> <b>recording</b> studio".|$|E
50|$|Studio 9 - This small {{studio was}} used when ITV2 used in-vision announcers and was located next to studio 7. It is now {{used for the}} studio's <b>tapeless</b> <b>recording</b> system {{allowing}} editors to edit programmes shortly {{after they have been}} recorded.|$|E
5000|$|Ingex Studio {{provides}} studio-style recoding, capture, transcode, and MXF wrapping {{for multiple}} cameras, {{also known as}} multi-camera <b>tapeless</b> <b>recording.</b> [...] The software runs on commodity PC hardware and SDI IO cards. The media can then be edited by MXF-based editors, for example, Avid Media Composer.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, Ikegami {{introduced}} Editcam, {{the first}} <b>tapeless</b> video <b>recording</b> system.|$|R
5000|$|XF Codec - a {{professional}} <b>tapeless</b> video <b>recording</b> format, similar to MPEG HD and MPEG HD422 but {{stored in a}} different container file.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008 the [...] "B" [...] {{modification}} of the GY-HD200 was released, allowing live recording of either 720p or 1080i signal onto an external <b>tapeless</b> recorder. <b>Recording</b> to tape was still performed in 720p mode only.|$|R
50|$|The HDV {{consortium}} allows {{using the}} HDV trademarks only for products that incorporate a tape drive that can record and play video cassette compliant to the HDV format. Therefore, HDV remains a tape-based format. Various solutions for <b>tapeless</b> <b>recording</b> of HDV video {{that are available}} on the market are not covered by HDV specification.|$|E
50|$|The first {{computer}} applications to offer fully digital <b>tapeless</b> <b>recording,</b> mixing and editing were Cubase and Notator for the Atari ST platform around 1989. In the 1990s, these and similar systems began gaining more ground among recording studios, and as computer processing and storing capacity increased, analog tape equipment was gradually replaced by fully computerized recording, {{in which every}} step in the production chain is carried out using software and digital storage.|$|E
50|$|Peacock Productions is a long-form {{production}} unit of NBC News. The division, established on July 15, 2007, produces factual programming such as news specials, documentary specials, and reality series. While {{some of its}} productions do air on other NBCUniversal outlets (such as the NBC network and MSNBC), it produces programs for competing broadcasters as well, such as the networks of A&E Networks and Discovery among others. Peacock has served as an incubator for new production technologies that have later been adopted by NBC News, such as <b>tapeless</b> <b>recording.</b>|$|E
50|$|A tapeless {{camcorder}} is a camcorder {{that does}} not use video tape for the digital recording of video productions as 20th century ones did. <b>Tapeless</b> camcorders <b>record</b> video as digital computer files onto data storage devices such as optical discs, hard disk drives and solid-state flash memory cards.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 JVC {{expanded}} the ProHD lineup with <b>tapeless</b> camcorders that <b>record</b> MPEG-2 video either in QuickTime or in XDCAM EX format.|$|R
50|$|Consumer camcorders have {{switched}} from being tape-based to <b>tapeless</b> machines that <b>record</b> video as computer files. Small hard disks and writable optical discs have been used, with solid-state memory such as SD cards being {{the current market}} leader. There are two primary advantages: First, copying a tape recording onto a computer or other video machine occurs in real time (e.g. a ten-minute video would take ten minutes to copy); since <b>tapeless</b> camcorders <b>record</b> video as computer-ready data files, the files can simply be copied onto a computer. Second, tapeless camcorders, and those using solid-state memory in particular, are far simpler mechanically and so are more reliable.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{generally}} believed that digital <b>tapeless</b> <b>recording</b> {{is the most}} robust and easy-to-manage solution for audio and video production. Nevertheless, particularly within the audio world, there has been significant demand for returning to all-analog, even vintage, recording equipment, to achieve a softer, [...] "warmer" [...] sound {{at the expense of}} precise sound replication. This has not so much been the case with video production, as vintage equipment is often inoperable or unable to work with current technology, and generally lacks the quality achieved by digital video technology.|$|E
50|$|Digital <b>tapeless</b> <b>{{recording}}</b> {{refers to}} any recording method using digital data recorded to a medium other than audio/videotape (usually hard disk, CD-style or flash memory). It is popular in sound recording circles using computers or specialized workstations, and has {{something of a}} following among video users as well (in particular, among both low-end camcorder users who want the ultimate in light, silent equipment, and among high-end video and film producers doing high-definition video at such a high bitrate that tape simply cannot keep up. It is also common on mid-to-high end portable voice recorders, which record to formats such as MP3 or ATRAC.|$|E
5000|$|He {{pioneered the}} {{introduction}} of completely MIDI <b>tapeless</b> <b>recording</b> using the Yamaha QX1 Digital sequencer and the Synclavier with the Synth Axe MIDI guitar controller and Yamaha DX7 and TX816 synthesizers in soap opera music, and composed and programmed numerous successful jingles and movie soundtracks {{as well as many}} game show themes. He worked for Score Productions and ABC in New York City and wrote national jingles for such products as Cheerios, Campbell's Soup, Nestle's, Crisco, and American Express, He was the first composer in New York City to record entirely [...] "Direct-To-Disk". His sonic innovations at that time with Guitar synthesizer and MIDI programming earned him great accolades in the TV music industry which soon established him with the nickname [...] "Dr. MIDI".|$|E
50|$|In 2010, {{after the}} success of James Cameron's 2009 3D film Avatar, full 1080p HD 3D camcorders entered the market. With the {{proliferation}} of file-based digital formats, the relationship between recording media and recording format has declined; video can be recorded onto different media. With <b>tapeless</b> formats, <b>recording</b> media are storage for digital files.|$|R
5000|$|With {{proliferation}} of <b>tapeless</b> camcorder video <b>recording,</b> DV video can be recorded on optical discs, solid state flash memory cards and hard disk drives {{and used as}} computer files. In particular: ...|$|R
50|$|All tape-based video formats are {{becoming}} increasingly obsolete as <b>tapeless</b> HD cameras <b>recording</b> on memory cards, hard-disk drives, and optical discs have become the norm, although the DV encoding standard is sometimes still used in tapeless cameras.|$|R
5000|$|XDCAM - {{a family}} of <b>tapeless</b> video <b>recording</b> formats, which, in particular, {{includes}} formats based on MPEG-2 Part 2. These are: standard definition MPEG IMX (see above), high definition MPEG HD, high definition MPEG HD422. MPEG IMX and MPEG HD422 employ 4:2:2 color subsampling, MPEG HD employs 4:2:0 color subsampling. Most subformats use selectable constant video data rate from 25 to 50 Mbit/s, although {{there is also a}} variable bitrate mode with maximum 18 Mbit/s data rate.|$|R
50|$|Digital {{technology}} {{emerged with}} the Sony D1, a device which recorded uncompressed data and required {{a large amount}} of bandwidth for its time. In 1992 Ampex introduced DCT, the first digital video format with data compression using the discrete cosine transform algorithm present in most commercial digital video formats. In 1995 Sony, JVC, Panasonic and other video-camera manufacturers launched DV, which became a de facto standard for home video production, independent filmmaking and citizen journalism. That year, Ikegami introduced Editcam (the first <b>tapeless</b> video <b>recording</b> system).|$|R
50|$|Equipment {{that uses}} Professional Disc {{as well as}} XDCAM 4:2:2 on SxS cards as {{recording}} media employs MXF container to store digital audio/digital video streams. <b>Tapeless</b> camcorders that <b>record</b> onto solid-state memory cards, use MP4 container for high definition audio/video, and DV-AVI container for DV video. JVC camcorders that use XDCAM EX recording format, are also capable of recording into QuickTime container besides using MP4 container.|$|R
5000|$|Linear video editing is a video editing {{post-production}} {{process of}} selecting, arranging and modifying images and sound in a predetermined, ordered sequence. [...] Regardless {{of whether it}} was captured by a video camera, <b>tapeless</b> camcorder, or <b>recorded</b> in a television studio on a video tape recorder (VTR) the content must be accessed sequentially. For the most part video editing software has replaced linear editing.|$|R
5000|$|P2 (P2 is a {{short form}} for [...] "Professional Plug-In") is a {{professional}} digital recording solid-state memory storage media format introduced by Panasonic in 2004, and especially tailored to electronic news-gathering (ENG) applications. It features <b>tapeless</b> (non-linear) <b>recording</b> of DV, DVCPRO, DVCPRO25, DVCPRO50, DVCPRO-HD, or AVC-Intra streams on a solid-state flash memory. The P2 card is essentially a RAID of Secure Digital (SD) memory cards with an LSI controller tightly packaged in a die-cast PC Card (formerly PCMCIA) enclosure, so data transfer rate increases as memory capacity increases. The system includes cameras, decks as drop-in replacements for Videocassette recorders (VCR), and a special 5.25-inch computer drive for random-access integration with non-linear editing systems (NLE). The cards {{can also be used}} directly where a PC card (PCMCIA) slot is available, as in most older notebook computers, as a normal hard disk drive, although a custom software driver must first be loaded.|$|R
