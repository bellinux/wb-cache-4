5|$|After {{the end of}} the war in Europe, the 395th Guards Heavy Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment was {{transferred}} to the Far East for <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Manchuria. Snetkov became its chief of intelligence and assistant chief of staff for intelligence, and ended the war with the rank of captain. Between 8 August and 3 September, the regiment fought in <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Manchuria attached to the 5th Army, and on 8 September he received a second Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class, for providing crucial intelligence gained from reconnaissance to his unit.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} was reformed in the Far East in November 1944 and fought in <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Manchuria before being disbanded postwar in late 1945.|$|E
5|$|Even though Lazar Kaganovich and Kalinin {{were both}} {{commissioned}} {{before the end}} of the war, they saw no action during <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Manchuria in 1945; in any event, Lazar Kaganovich was not fully completed until 29 January 1947.|$|E

5|$|His {{government}} {{was recognized by}} the western Allies. Nonetheless Sikorski's government struggled to get its point of view heard by France and the United Kingdom. The western Allies refused to recognize the Soviet Union as an aggressor, despite <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Poland on 17 September 1939. Furthermore, he struggled to secure resources needed to recreate the Polish Army in exile.|$|E
5|$|In January 1980, in {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Afghanistan, President Carter postponed consideration of the SALT-2 Treaty and imposed a trade embargo.

He became commander of the Bryansk Front in October 1941 and was fatally wounded during the breakout from the Bryansk Pocket.|$|E
5|$|The 15th Tank Corps was a tank {{corps of}} the Soviet Union's Red Army. It was first formed in 1938 from a {{mechanized}} corps and fought in <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Poland before being disbanded in January 1940. During its first formation, it {{participated in the}} capture {{of the city of}} Grodno and Augustów Forest from Poland, and the corps finished its service at Wilno and Soleczniki.|$|E
5|$|All {{publications}} and media {{were subjected to}} censorship. The Soviets sought to recruit Polish left-wing intellectuals {{who were willing to}} cooperate. Soon after <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion,</b> the Writers' Association of Soviet Ukraine created a local chapter in Lwów; there was a Polish-language theater and radio station. Polish cultural activities in Minsk and Wilno were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which saw to it that these activities portrayed the new Soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the USSR {{had built up}} a {{military}} arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon after <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986, the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history.|$|E
5|$|However, another {{obstacle}} arose with <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Afghanistan, {{which resulted}} in a boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western World, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 {{a statue}} of Żółkiewski was built in Źółkiew, but it was {{demolished}} in 1939 by Soviet troops {{in the aftermath of}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Poland. In modern Poland Źółkiewski is celebrated as a military hero, but modern Russia's Unity Day instead celebrates the anniversary of the surrender of the Polish forces he installed in the Moscow garrison. As of 2011, the St. Lawrence's Church and castle in Źółkwia were being renovated by a team of Polish and Ukrainians conservators.|$|E

In 1940 he made an unsuccessful attempt to escape to Hungary. In the end he spent the whole time of the German occupation in Kraków.|$|R
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the Soviets started to assert {{themselves}} in several new theaters of action, in particular through Cuban proxies during the Angolan Civil War starting in 1975 and <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Afghanistan in 1979. U.S. strategy to this point had been focused on containing Communism and preparation for war in Europe. The new Soviet actions revealed that the military lacked capability outside these narrow confines.|$|E
5|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the Pacific Fleet in 1943. She {{was ordered to}} prepare for transfer to the Soviet Northern Fleet via the Northern Sea Route on 24 April 1943 and extensive preparations were made for the voyage. They included the installation of special propellers with removable blades and the strengthening of her hull to withstand ice pressure. The transfer was canceled without explanation on 1 June 1943, but the alterations remained in place until 1944. She remained inactive during <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Manchuria in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Early during Kosygin's tenure, the Brezhnev–Kosygin {{attempt to}} create {{stability}} was failing on various fronts. From 1969 to 1970 discontent within the Soviet leadership had grown {{to such an extent}} that some started to doubt both former and current Soviet policies. Examples include the handling of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Czechoslovakia (which Kosygin initially resisted), the decline in agriculture production, the Sino–Soviet border conflict (he advocated restraint), the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–American talks on the limitation of strategic missiles. Two summit conferences between the US and the USSR were held: the Warsaw Pact Summit Conference and the Moscow Summit Conference; both failed to gain support for Soviet policies.|$|E

25|$|After Daisies the {{government}} {{made it very}} difficult for Chytilová to find work within Czechoslovakia, even though she was never officially classified as a 'blacklisted' director. Her follow-up film Ovoce stromů rajských jíme (Fruit of Paradise, 1969) was her last film before <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union <b>invasion</b> of 1968. After <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union <b>invasion</b> it was virtually impossible for Chytilová to find work and she resorted to directing commercials under her husband’s name, Jaroslav Kučera.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soviets</b> {{claimed that}} Česiūnas had {{met a woman}} named Ursula Vorkhert who invited {{to spend the night}} with him and then drugged him up. Česiūnas later {{appeared}} with anti-Communist Lithuanians and being asked to speak out in favor of a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, two months before <b>the</b> <b>Soviet's</b> <b>invasion</b> of Afghanistan and almost six months before American President Jimmy Carter's actual boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics.|$|R
5|$|In 1942, {{the ship}} was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration, which {{transferred}} her to the Soviet Union {{under the terms of}} Lend-Lease in December 1942. She was assigned to the Far East Shipping Company under her new name of SSTashkent, but sailed with the Soviet Pacific Fleet throughout the war. She delivered cargo and troops in support of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Japanese-held territories in August 1945. After the war, the ship remained a part of the Soviet merchant fleet until 1966. She was transferred to North Korea at that time to become a fish processing facility, and was scrapped in 1969.|$|E
5|$|She {{was renamed}} Lazar Kaganovich in 1945 to {{disassociate}} her from Lazar's disgraced brother Mikhail Kaganovich. She remained inactive during <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Manchuria in 1945. She spent the post-war period on routine training missions. She was renamed Petropavlovsk on 3 August 1957 after Lazar Kaganovich was purged {{from the government}} after an unsuccessful coup against Nikita Khrushchev that same year. Her superstructure was badly damaged by a Force 12 typhoon on 19 September 1957. Sources disagree on her fate; one says that she was converted into a floating barracks on 6 February 1960 and later sold for scrap while another says that she was simply sold for scrap on 6 February 1960.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasion</b> of Afghanistan in December 1979 and {{threatened}} {{boycott of the}} 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow led organizers to consider again postponing the Canada Cup. While Eagleson initially favoured allowing the tournament to go ahead regardless of the political situation, he ultimately agreed that Hockey Canada should again postpone the Canada Cup after the Canadian Government joined the Olympic boycott. A brief effort to move the tournament to Sweden was quickly put down when Eagleson informed them that neither Hockey Canada nor the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA) would participate in such an event.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>invasions</b> of Afghanistan in 1979 and of Czechoslovakia in 1968 {{are both}} {{examples}} of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> determination to intervene militarily in neighboring countries when their communist governments become, in <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> view, untrustworthy {{and unable to}} maintain control. Whereas Czechoslovakia belongs inside <b>the</b> traditional <b>Soviet</b> security belt of Eastern Europe and had been a communist country {{for more than two}} decades, Afghanistan, a third world Muslim country, is part of Asia and has had a ruling Marxist party only since 1978...|$|R
