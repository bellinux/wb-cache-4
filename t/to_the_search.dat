5|$|Fuqua {{was fired}} on October 1, 2004, four weeks before {{principal}} photography would begin. The studio cited creative differences for the director's departure. After Fuqua's departure, the studio met with Peter Berg {{to take over}} directing the film, and Denzel Washington had approved of the choice. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> potentially escalating a budget already in the US$80million range and the difficulty in recouping the amount based on the film's subject matter, Universal canceled production of American Gangster, citing time constraints and creative elements for its reason. The cancellation cost the studio $30million, of which $20million went to Washington and $5million went to del Toro due to their pay or play contracts.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> for {{the remains}} of the ship herself, there was considerable Australian interest in locating relics of the ship's south Pacific voyage. In 1886, the Working Men's Progress Association of Cooktown sought to recover the sixcannons thrown overboard when Endeavour grounded on the Great Barrier Reef. A £300 reward was offered for anyone who could locate and recover the guns, but searches that year and the next were fruitless and the money went unclaimed. Remains of equipment left at Endeavour River were discovered in around 1900, and in 1913 the crew of a merchant steamer erroneously claimed to have recovered an Endeavour cannon from shallow water near the Reef.|$|E

The agency's website maintains press releases, transcripts of press conferences, communiqués of the tripartite meetings (between Australia, China, and Malaysia), and photos, videos, maps, and reports published by several agencies that are related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>search.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Search for Spock {{opened on}} June 1, 1984. In its {{first week of}} release, the film grossed over $16 million from almost 2,000 theaters across North America. It went on to gross $76 million at the {{domestic}} box office, {{with a total of}} $87 million worldwide. Critical reaction <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Search</b> for Spock was positive, but notably less so than the previous film. Reviewers generally praised the cast and characters, while criticism tended to focus on the plot; the special effects were conflictingly received. Roger Ebert called the film a compromise between the tones of the first and second Star Trek films. The Search for Spock has since been released on multiple home video formats, including VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray high definition discs. Nimoy went on to direct The Search for Spocks sequel, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.|$|E

If, {{after a certain}} number of iterations, the dead-end elimination algorithm does not prune any more rotamers, then either rotamers have to be merged or another search algorithm must be used <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>the</b> remaining <b>search</b> space.

5|$|Varis zos Galvus is crowned Garlean {{emperor and}} begins {{consolidating}} power, lending new urgency <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> for Ivy. The Braves discover that Ivy is Raubahn's trusted advisor Eline Roaille, who is captured {{at the gates}} of a Garlean Castrum. A new Scion, Moenbryda, arrives from Sharlayan and provides critical advice for locating Iceheart. Using her body as a vessel, Iceheart summons Shiva into herself and challenges the Warrior of Light. Though the adventurer's band defeats Shiva, Iceheart escapes, bidding the meddler to consult with Midgardsormr. Based on the player's encounters with Lahabrea and Shiva, Moenbryda hypothesizes that Ascians may be permanently destroyed by trapping their souls within white auracite and cleaving them with a blast of pure aether, much like Hydaelyn's blade of light. Lucia of the Temple Knights requests that the Warrior of Light investigate suspicious activity at the Keeper of the Lake. At its apex, the adventurer discovers that Midgardsormr lives on, slowly regenerating from his apparent death. He divulges that Nidhogg, one of his seven children, has rallied the Dravanian horde to renew their attack on Ishgard. Sensing the hero's connection to Hydaelyn, Midgardsormr invokes an ancient pact with the Mothercrystal and seals away her blessing as a test of the player's worth. The Ascian Nabriales takes advantage of the opportunity to infiltrate the Scions' headquarters in pursuit of Louisoix's staff. Moenbryda sacrifices herself to create the blade of light necessary to completely destroy the Ascian.|$|E
