40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the Saffman-Taylor problem describing {{the displacement of}} one fluid by another having a smaller viscosity, in a porous medium or in a Hele-Shaw configuration, and the Taylor-Saffman problem of a bubble moving in a channel containing moving fluid. Each problem is known to possess a family of solutions, the former corresponding <b>to</b> <b>propagating</b> fingers and the latter <b>to</b> <b>propagating</b> bubbles, with each member characterized by its own velocity and each occupying a different fraction of the porous channel through which it <b>propagates.</b> <b>To</b> select the correct {{member of the family}} of solutions, the conventional approach has been to add surface tension σ and then take the limit σ → 0. We propose a selection criterion that does not rely on surface tension arguments...|$|R

Robinson (1866-1942) and {{his wife}} Marion James Robinson (1873-1919) were wealthy {{residents}} of San Diego, California known for their impact on gardening and the cultivation of flowers, particularly begonias.

40|$|Small {{intestinal}} intraluminal pressure {{activity and}} aboral traction forces were explored in 19 healthy volunteers using a combined manometry and traction force detecting assembly sited {{in the upper}} small intestine. Each aboral traction event was classified as being associated with either a propagating or a stationary contraction and its force measured. During phase I no contractions or traction events were seen. During phase II, traction events related <b>to</b> <b>propagating</b> contractions mean (SEM) (2. 2 (0. 2) /min) and to stationary contractions (0. 3 (0. 1) /min) generated similar force/event (7. 5 (0. 9 g v 8. 7 (1. 4) g, p > 0. 05). During phase III, all traction events were related <b>to</b> <b>propagating</b> contractions and generated 9. 3 (2. 4) g force/event (p > 0. 05 v phase II). After feeding, traction events related <b>to</b> <b>propagating</b> contractions generated similar force/event to those related to stationary contractions (5. 9 (1. 0) g v 9. 3 (2. 7) g, p > 0. 05 v each other and v fasting).

5|$|Flowering {{may take}} some years from seed; a minimum of four years is average. Buying an {{advanced}} plant may hasten this process, as will getting a cutting-grown plant.

5|$|Horticulturists and {{scientists}} Rodger Elliot and David L. Jones {{have proposed that}} cultivating the plant would aid in its conservation.

Propagation would theoretically be by seed or by taking cuttings of new growth, though plants of the genus Persoonia as a genus are generally difficult <b>to</b> <b>propagate</b> by any means in cultivation.|$|E
