5|$|The episode borrows {{heavily from}} the 1985 comedy film Clue, the 1976 comedy film Murder by Death, and is largely {{based upon the}} 1939 Agatha Christie novel And Then There Were None.

As they walk into the mansion, Sir John Everett Millais's Ophelia is seen. As dinner commences, Carl begins conversing with Tom Tucker, and discusses the plot of the 1986 fantasy film Labyrinth, directed by Jim Henson.|$|E
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws <b>the</b> <b>shining</b> iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|E

40|$|Some recent {{developments}} for the Shine-Bower single-subject ANOVA and <b>the</b> <b>Shine</b> Combined ANOVA are integrated {{in order to}} remove the restriction of an even number of trials for <b>the</b> <b>Shine</b> Combined ANOVA. SHINE (1977 b) has recently removed the restriction of an even num-ber of trials for the Shine-Bower single-subject ANOVA. This is done by basing the Shine-Bower error term on any subset or set of subsets of successive trials from the overall complete set of trials, {{rather than on the}} overall complete set of trials itself, where each subset is chosen on an a priori basis and has an even number of trials, This new procedure does not require an even overall number of trials and also allows the experimenter considerable flexibility to design the Shine-Bower error term (on an a priori basis) to fit the needs of his own experimentation. Shine (1977 a) has also recently presented a new procedure for getting around the independence and distributional problems of the original F test for the trial-by-subject interaction in <b>the</b> <b>Shine</b> Combined ANOVA. <b>The</b> purpose of the present paper is {{to make use of the}} above {{recent developments}} in order to remove the restriction of an even number of trials for <b>the</b> <b>Shine</b> Combined ANOVA. Since the tests for subject effects in <b>the</b> <b>Shine</b> Combined ANOVA are the only ones in that design which are based on the Shine-Bower error term, only those tests need consideration in the present paper. It is assumed throughout this paper that the basic assumptions of <b>the</b> <b>Shine</b> Combined ANOVA are met...|$|R
