The transcript accumulation pattern of TPI matched its protein expression profiles under both control and stress conditions, however sucrose synthase exhibited an opposite transcript accumulation pattern in comparison to its protein profile under control conditions in Pokkali. Under salinity stress, however both transcript and protein levels of sucrose synthase were found to increase in Pokkali in comparison to IR 64 (Fig. 6 m-p). Another candidate, peroxidase, showed an increase in transcript levels under both control and stress conditions in Pokkali even though its protein levels could not be detected under control conditions (Fig. 6 m-p). Overall, we could observe the differential pattern of gene expression with some genes showing correlations between their protein and transcript profiles.|$|R

The {{activities}} of NADP-glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (NADP-GAPD) and ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPC) were 2670 and 52 micromoles per milligrams chlorophyll per hour, respectively. Activities of NADP-GAPD and RuBPC in guard cells were increased by red light illumination, and the light activations were inhibited completely by 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea (DCMU), an inhibitor of photosystem II. Enzymes related to the Calvin-Benson cycle such as 3 -phosphoglycerate kinase (PGAK), <b>triose</b> <b>phosphate</b> (TP) <b>isomerase,</b> and fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase (FBPase) were shown {{to be present in}} guard-cell chloroplasts. From these results, we conclude that the photosynthetic carbon reduction pathway is present in guard-cell chloroplasts of Vicia faba. We compared these enzyme activities in guard cells with those in mesophyll cells. The activities of NADP-GAPD and PGAK were more than several-fold higher and that of TP isomerase was much higher in guard-cell chloroplasts than in mesophyll chloroplasts. In contrast, activities of RuBPC and FBPase were estimated to be roughly half of those in mesophyll chloroplasts. High activities of PGAK, NAD-GAPD, and TP isomerase {{were found in}} fractions enriched in cytosol of guard cells. Illumination of guard-cell protoplasts with red light increased the cellular ATP/ADP ratio from 5 to 14. These results support the interpretation that guard cells utilize a shuttle system (e. g. phosphoglycerate [PGA]/dihydroxyacetone phosphate [DHAP] shuttle) for an indirect transfer of ATP and reducing equivalents from chloroplasts to the cytosol...|$|R
50|$|Fru-2,6-P2 {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the regulation of <b>triose</b> <b>phosphates,</b> the end products of the Calvin Cycle. In the Calvin Cycle, 5/6th of <b>triose</b> <b>phosphates</b> are recycled to make ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate.

Fru-2,6-P2 inhibits production of fructose 6-phosphate, a necessary element for sucrose synthesis. When the rate of photosynthesis in the light reactions is high, <b>triose</b> <b>phosphates</b> are constantly produced and the production of Fru-2,6-P2 is inhibited, thus producing sucrose.

40|$|Metabolite {{levels in}} kernels of {{selected}} starch-deficient mutants of maize (Zea mays L.) were investigated to {{gain insight into}} partitioning of carbohydrate metabolism during kernel development. Several free sugars, hexose <b>phosphates,</b> <b>triose</b> <b>phosphates,</b> fructose- 2, 6 -bisphosphate, and pyrophosphate were measured in normal, shrunken, shrunken- 2, amylose extender dull waxy, and brittle genotypes, which were in a near-isogenic W 64 A background. These mutants were selected to include at least one lesion in both the cytosolic (shrunken) and amyloplastic (shrunken- 2) compartments. All the starch-deficient genotypes contained elevated levels of fructose- 2, 6 -bisphosphate and <b>triose</b> <b>phosphates</b> but reduced levels of pyrophosphate, indicating an enhanced glycolytic utilization of carbohydrates {{in response to the}} reduced utilization of sugars for starch synthesis. The shrunken kernels (sucrose synthase deficient) contained reduced levels of glucose- 1 -phosphate, glucose- 6 -phosphate, and fructose- 6 -phosphate, and this reduction paralleled the reduction in starch accumulation, but levels of <b>triose</b> <b>phosphates</b> were elevated. In shrunken- 2 kernels, glucose- 1 -phosphate, glucose- 6 -phosphate, and fructose- 6 -phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate were increased, but fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate was lower.

These experiments showed that starch and sucrose synthesis can partially replace each other. To determine how leaf metabolism acclimates to an inhibition of both pathways, transgenic potato (S. tuberosum L. cv Desiree) plants, with a 30 % reduction of the TPT achieved by antisense repression, were transformed with an antisense cDNA of the small subunit of AGPase, driven by the leaf-specific ST-LS 1 promoter.
