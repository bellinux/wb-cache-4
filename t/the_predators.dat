5|$|After the Predators' {{regular season}} success in 2005–06, the team bolstered their lineup by {{acquiring}} centre Jason Arnott and winger Jean-Pierre Dumont. In response to Arnott's signing, Kariya {{commented that the}} centre position, as well as size, were weaknesses for the team the previous year, especially when they matched up against the Sharks' top two centres, Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau, in the playoffs. Leading up to the 2006–07 season, <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> were picked by many analysts in the media (including those from The Globe and Mail and ESPN) to contend for the Stanley Cup. Prior {{to the start of}} the campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> announced defenceman Kimmo Timonen as the team's new captain, while naming Kariya and Steve Sullivan as alternates (the two served in that role the previous season, as well, but not on a permanent basis). With Kariya leading the team in scoring, the team boasted the top record in the league by the All-Star break. At the NHL trade deadline, the team further bolstered their lineup by acquiring high-profile centre Peter Forsberg from Philadelphia. Forsberg joined Kariya on the top line, though not consistently. With 76 points (24 goals and 52 assists)—the second highest total in team history—over 82 games, Kariya led <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> in scoring for a second-straight year. His seven shootout goals (over 11 attempts) tied for second in the league, one behind Erik Christensen of the Pittsburgh Penguins. <b>The</b> <b>Predators</b> continued to improve and finished with a new team record of 51 wins and 110 points. Despite ranking as the second-best team in the West, Nashville seeded fourth in their conference (divisional winners within the conference take the top three seeds; Detroit beat <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> by three points in the Central Division). Playing against the San Jose Sharks for the second consecutive year, <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> were once again eliminated in five games. Kariya struggled with two assists during the series.|$|E

5|$|On {{the opening}} day of free agency, Hodgson signed a one-year {{contract}} with the Nashville Predators. Hodgson made the opening night roster of <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> to begin the 2015–16 season. He was used primarily in a depth role, centering the fourth-line. After posting 8 points in 39 games, Hodgson was placed on waivers by <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> on January 13, 2016. Hodgson passed through waivers unclaimed and was subsequently assigned to AHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals the following day. Hodgson was not offered a new contract by the club, and became an unrestricted free agent on July 1. On October 3, it was announced that Hodgson had retired and would be working within <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> organization, coaching for their Little Preds Learn to Play Program.|$|E
5|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Hamhuis would not be re-signed by <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> following the 2009–10 season, his negotiating rights were traded to the Philadelphia Flyers, along with a 2011 conditional draft pick, for Ryan Parent on June 19, 2010. Hamhuis and <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> had been negotiating for most of the season, {{as well as in the}} summer, but Nashville was not willing to meet his asking price. After failing to agree to a contract with Philadelphia as well, his rights were traded once again to the Pittsburgh Penguins for a 2011 third-round pick on June 25; negotiations with the club were also unsuccessful.|$|E

In a rematch with Columbus five days later, he scored his first NHL goal against Mathieu Garon in a 3–2 win. Remaining with <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> {{for the remainder of the}} campaign, Blum recorded 3 goals and 8 points over 23 NHL games while averaging 17 minutes and 45 seconds of ice time per contest. Making his Stanley Cup playoffs debut in Game 1 of the opening round against the Anaheim Ducks, Blum helped <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> to a 4–1 win with one assist. The following game, Ducks forward Bobby Ryan stomped on Blum's foot with his skate while the two players were tied up behind the Predators' net. Blum was not injured on the play, while Ryan was given a two-game suspension for the play. <b>The</b> <b>Predators</b> went on to eliminate the Ducks in six games, advancing to the second round, where they were defeated by the Vancouver Canucks. Blum finished the 2011 playoffs with two assists over 12 games. Following the elimination, Blum was reassigned to the Admirals for their 2011 playoff season. He dressed for one game, an elimination match against the Houston Aeros in the second round, which Milwaukee lost.|$|E

5|$|During the Predators' {{training}} camp in September 2005, Kariya suffered separate ankle and groin injuries that limited his participation in team practices and pre-season games. Recovering {{in time for the}} season-opener, he debuted with <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> on October 5, 2005, at home against the San Jose Sharks. Early in the game, Kariya was routinely cheered by fans when he touched the puck. Trailing 2–1 in the third period, he scored on goaltender Evgeni Nabokov to the tie the game, en route to a 3–2 win. The following game, Kariya participated in his first NHL shootout (the tie-breaker was newly implemented by the League for the 2005–06 season) after <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> remained tied with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim 2–2 following overtime. The last of three shooters for <b>the</b> <b>Predators,</b> Kariya was the lone player to score in the shootout, leading Nashville to a 3–2 win. The two wins helped Nashville go undefeated in their first eight games, two wins shy of the League's record for consecutive victories to start a season. On April 18, 2006, {{the last day of the}} regular season, Kariya scored a hat-trick against the Detroit Red Wings in a 6–3 win, helping <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> secure the fourth seed in the Western Conference. In his first season with Nashville, Kariya set team records with 31 goals, 54 assists and 85 points. His 14 power play goals also tied defenceman Andy Delmore's team record set in 2002–03, while his 245 shots came within three of Cliff Ronning's mark set in 1998–99. With five shootout goals over seven attempts, Kariya ranked fourth in the NHL in shootout scoring percentage at 71.4% (among players who had taken at least five attempts). On a team basis, <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> set franchise records with 49 wins and 106 points, ranking fourth in the West. Matching up against the San Jose Sharks in the first round of the 2006 playoffs, Kariya opened the post-season with four assists in Game 1 to lead Nashville to a 4–3 win. After taking Game 1, <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> went on to lose the next four contests and were eliminated from the playoffs. The team was markedly weakened for the playoffs with starting goaltender Tomáš Vokoun unavailable due to injury and Kariya's linemate Steve Sullivan playing hurt. Kariya had two goals and seven points over the series.|$|E
5|$|In the 2012 offseason, with <b>the</b> <b>Predators</b> {{unable to}} take Weber to {{arbitration}} again (a player can only be subjected to team-elected arbitration once in his career), Weber signed a front-loaded $110 million, 14-year offer sheet, $68 million {{of it as a}} signing bonus, from the Philadelphia Flyers on July 19. The offer sheet was the richest in NHL history in terms of total money, money per season and length, surpassing the previous offer sheet record set by Thomas Vanek. <b>The</b> <b>Predators,</b> already having lost Weber's defensive partner Ryan Suter to unrestricted free agency, matched the offer sheet five days later. Following the 2012-13 NHL lockout, the CBA was changed to prevent teams from signing other players to similar deals.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the optimal {{behavior of a}} cryptic prey individual as it is approached by a predator searching for prey. Although <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> has not yet discovered the prey, it has an increasing likelihood of doing so as it gets closer to the prey. Further, <b>the</b> closer <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> is to <b>the</b> prey when it discovers it, the more likely <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> will be to capture the prey. These arguments suggest that the prey should flee before <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> discovers it. However, the act of fleeing will alert <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> to <b>the</b> presence of the prey and trigger an attack {{that might not have}} occurred otherwise. We capture these conflicting outcomes in a mathematical model, which we then use to predict the optimal behavior of <b>the</b> prey and <b>predator.</b> We argue that the optimal strategy for the prey is either to run as soon as they detect a predator approaching or to only flee in response to having been detected by <b>the</b> <b>predator.</b> Running as soon as <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> is detected is associated with low predator search speeds, a low nonpredation cost to running, a large advantage to the prey in initiating chases rather than reacting, limited ability to spot <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> at distance, a high ability to spot prey by <b>the</b> <b>predator,</b> and a high probability that chases will be successful. The optimal strategy for <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> depends on whether its current trajectory is taking it closer to or further from the prey. In the latter case, <b>the</b> <b>predator</b> should attack immediately on discovering the prey; in the former case, it should delay its attack until it reaches the point on its current trajectory where distance to the prey is minimized.
