5|$|CTL-1 – Designed by Marmon-Herrington <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> to the Polish Army, {{but it was}} {{rejected}} by them. Only one was ever produced.|$|E
5|$|Two other tank {{designs were}} {{produced}} by Marmon-Herrington that branched {{directly from the}} CTLS. They were both intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> to the Dutch, but were overtaken by the Ordnance Department.|$|E
5|$|CAPS {{researchers}} are also collaborating with Virginia Tech {{on a project}} for the U.S. Office of Naval Research to evaluate the performance of an electrical impedance measurement unit (IMU) developed by Virginia Tech and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> to CAPS for testing. The purpose of an IMU is to probe a power system for its impedance characteristics to establish criteria for stable operation of the system.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the years, several ships have sunk near Runde on the Norwegian coast. Some of them <b>are</b> said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ships</b> {{from the}} Netherlands and Spain, loaded with gold and silver.|$|R
50|$|QorIQ T Series {{is based}} on a 28 nm process and is pushing a very {{aggressive}} power envelope target, capping at 30 W. These are using the e6500 core with AltiVec and <b>are</b> expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipping</b> in 2013.|$|R

5|$|Part of Wappocomo's {{original}} land tract, {{located near}} the city limits of Romney, was sold for residential building lots and for the Fruit Growers Storage facility, a refrigerated storage plant for fruit stands along the South Branch Valley Railroad near the mansion. The Fruit Growers Storage facility also provided refrigerated storage for fruit that was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> as freight on the South Branch Valley Railroad.|$|E
5|$|The 5th (West Africa) Brigade was {{the second}} of the 81st Division's brigades <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> from West Africa. The brigade {{comprised}} 12,000 personnel and was scheduled to depart with Convoy WS32 on 31 July. The liners Britannic, Largs Bay and Tamaroa were available in Freetown to carry 8,528 of these men, and it was decided to sail the troopship SS California directly from the Clyde to provide the remaining berths.|$|E
5|$|The chained {{slaves were}} packed under {{the deck of}} a small vessel named The Schooner York <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> to the island (other sources say the voyage took place aboard The Morovia). During this voyage the Igbo slaves rose up in rebellion, taking control of the ship and {{drowning}} their captors in the process causing the grounding of the Morovia in Dunbar Creek at the site now locally known as Igbo Landing.|$|E
50|$|On , Intel {{unveiled}} formally its 14 nm manufacturing process, {{which is}} used for Broadwell, and indicated that mobile variants of the process will be known as Core M products. Additionally, Core M products <b>were</b> announced <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipping</b> during the end of 2014, with desktop variants shipping shortly after.|$|R
50|$|Down {{on their}} luck after a botched {{smuggling}} run, Han Solo and Chewbacca resort to accepting {{a job offer}} from an anonymous employer. However, after flying the Millennium Falcon to the planet Lur for the pickup, they discover that the cargo they're meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>are</b> slaves - something for which neither Han nor Chewbacca has any tolerance.|$|R
50|$|Although Bender accepts his loss, his ass {{finds it}} {{unbearable}} {{to listen to}} Tarquin reading bible verses. It escapes from the lighthouse and returns to Bender. Upon the reunion, fireworks appear in the sky, but they turn out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ships</b> exploding in the Sargaseous Sea, where the lighthouse beacon shines no more.|$|R
5|$|The highest winds {{reported}} {{during the}} storm were 34.9m/s (78mph, 126km/h). These winds blew sand about 7cm (3in) deep {{off the beach}} and into residents' yards. Typhoon Ewiniar caused a reported 20,000,000yen ($173,778) worth of sugar cane and vegetable damage, and farmers experienced profit losses when ripe fruits were unable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> to Asian markets.|$|E
5|$|At this distance, {{the land}} {{would be far}} beyond the maximum {{anticipated}} size of the city's growth, greatly reducing any potential hazards. The London and South Western Railway(LSWR)– which had connected London to Woking in 1838– would enable bodies and mourners <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> from London to the site easily and cheaply. Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London, Broun and Sprye argued that {{the speed of the}} railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries, all of which required a slow and expensive horse-drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site.|$|E
5|$|Broun's scheme had envisaged the {{cemetery}} running along {{both sides of}} the LSWR main line and divided by religion, with separate private railway halts on the main line, each incorporating a chapel, to serve each religion's section. The new consulting engineer to the company, William Cubitt, rejected this idea and recommended a single site to the south of the railway line, served by a private branch line through {{the cemetery}}. The company also considered Broun's plan for dedicated coffin trains unrealistic, arguing that relatives would not want the coffins <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> separately from the deceased's family.|$|E
50|$|While {{manufactured}} in Sweden, the Snow Trac proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a successful export and approximately 550 Snow Tracs <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> Alaska. At least 200 units <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> Canadian telephone utility Northwest Telephone in the Yukon Territory, Canada. Approximately 200 Snow Tracs {{ended up at}} the Canadian National Railway, and Snow Tracs were also located at each of the microwave sites {{along the length of the}} ALCAN (Alaska Canadian Highway). At least 400 more Snow Tracs <b>were</b> known <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> the Lower 48 states of the United States. At least 200 <b>were</b> known <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> Scotland.|$|R
25|$|On 17 March, the United States newsmagazine Time {{reported}} on the Southern Californian residents reaction to the risk from the fallout, and the run on iodine tablets. On 18 March, France <b>was</b> reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipping</b> iodide tablets <b>to</b> French Polynesia as a preventative measure, {{in light of the}} fallout cloud drifting across the Pacific.|$|R
50|$|By 2014, Honeywell <b>is</b> {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipping</b> {{a combined}} vision display (CVS) system called SmartView that overlays an {{enhanced vision system}} (EVS) onto a synthetic vision system (SVS). This gives the pilot a primary flight display that combines infrared, visual and sensor views into a single cockpit view comparable to an augmented reality view.|$|R
5|$|In response, ETOUSA {{initiated}} Operation Peppermint. Special {{equipment was}} prepared. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which {{were used to}} measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> by air with the highest priority. Chemical Warfare Service teams were trained in its use, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance. The equipment was held in readiness, but the preparations were not needed, because the Germans had not developed such weapons.|$|E
5|$|In the US, mono {{records were}} already being phased out; the US release of The Beatles {{was the first}} Beatles LP to be issued in stereo only. In the UK, the {{following}} album, Yellow Submarine, was the last <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> in mono. The mono version of The Beatles was made available worldwide on 9 September 2009, as part of The Beatles in Mono CD boxed set. A reissue of the original mono LP was released worldwide in September 2014.|$|E
5|$|Manstein was {{a proponent}} of the {{prospective}} German invasion of Great Britain, named Operation Seelöwe. He considered the operation risky but necessary. Early studies by various staff officers determined that air superiority was a prerequisite to the planned invasion. His corps was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> across the English Channel from Boulogne to Bexhill as one of four units assigned to the first wave. But as the Luftwaffe failed to overcome the Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain, Operation Seelöwe was postponed indefinitely on 12 October. For {{the rest of the}} year, Manstein, with little to do, spent time in Paris and at home.|$|E

5|$|The coffins of General Sikorski and his Chief-of-Staff, General Kilimecki, were {{draped in}} the Polish National Flag and lay in {{state in the}} Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned. After a Requiem Mass, the bodies were carried in {{procession}} to the H.M. Dockyard with full Military Honours <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> to London in anticipation that General Sikorski's remains {{would one day be}} returned to a liberated Poland. The route to the dockyard was lined by British troops and the coffins carried and escorted by Polish Servicemen.|$|E
5|$|The {{nuclear waste}} was planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> {{to the site}} by rail and/or truck in robust {{containers}} known as spent nuclear fuel shipping casks, approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. While the routes in Nevada would have been public, in the other states the planned routes, dates and times of transport would have been secret for security reasons. State and tribal representatives would have been notified before shipments of spent nuclear fuel entered their jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|An {{epidemic}} of dysentery broke {{out on the}} Kokoda Track that threatened the entire force. Some 1,200 casualties, mostly dysentery, reached Ilolo in September. Simple hygiene procedures involving the disposal of rubbish and excrement were required, but were neglected {{in the early stages}} of the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford arranged for supplies of a new drug, sulphaguanidine, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> from Australia. The widespread use of a scarce drug was a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, buried the dead, and, in extreme cases, burned villages that the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption.|$|E

5|$|Few records survive of the Brill Brick and Tile Works, {{as it came}} to be called, but it was {{operational}} by 1895. Jones (1974) {{says the}} siding to the brickworks opened with the extension to Brill, implying that Brill Brick and Tile Works existed in early 1872. This is almost certainly incorrect; no mention of the sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill Brick and Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895. The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along the Tramway.|$|E
5|$|Kalinin {{was one of}} the Project 26bis2 cruisers, {{the third}} pair of the s. She was larger and had a more {{powerful}} anti-aircraft armament than her half-sisters. She was assembled at the newly constructed Shipyard 199, Komsomolsk-on-Amur, from components built at the Shipyard 198 (Marti South) in Nikolayev. She was laid down on 12 August 1938, launched from drydock on 8 May 1942 and was completed on 31 December 1942 after being towed down the Amur River to Vladivostok. Her construction was prolonged by late deliveries from western factories. For example, her propellers had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> from Leningrad after it had been surrounded by the Germans and her propeller shafts had to be removed from the Barrikada factory in Stalingrad in 1942 before it was destroyed by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Many {{thousands}} of troops from all the countries involved were drafted to the area, and disease broke out almost immediately. Hundreds perished, mostly from cholera. Hundreds more would die waiting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> out, or on the voyage. Their prospects were little better {{when they arrived at}} the poorly staffed, unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were the only medical provision for the wounded. In Britain, a trenchant letter in The Times on 14 October triggered Sidney Herbert, Secretary of State for War, to approach Florence Nightingale to form a detachment of nurses to be sent to the hospital to save lives. Interviews were quickly held, suitable candidates selected, and Nightingale left for Turkey on 21 October.|$|E
25|$|The {{warships}} of {{the time}} <b>were</b> not designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ship</b> killers but rather troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, lashing the two ships together and then boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.|$|R
