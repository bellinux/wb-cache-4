25|$|The Manchester Guardian of 10 November 1888 {{reported}} that Sgt Edward Badham accompanied Inspector Walter Beck {{to the site}} of 13 Miller's Court after they were both notified of Kelly's murder by a frantic Bowyer.

Edward Badham was on duty at Commercial Street police station on the evening of 12 November 1888. The inquest into the death of Mary Kelly had been completed earlier <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> at around 6 p.m. George Hutchinson arrived at the station to give his initial statement to Badham.|$|E
25|$|Still {{wearing her}} {{fluorescent}} jacket, she knelt down at least 15 meters {{in front of}} the bulldozer, and began waving her arms and shouting, just as activists had successfully done dozens of times <b>that</b> <b>day....</b> <b>When</b> it got so close that it was moving the earth beneath her, she climbed onto the pile of rubble being pushed by the bulldozer.... Her head and upper torso were above the bulldozer's blade, and the bulldozer operator and co-operator could clearly see her. Despite this, the operator continued forward, which caused her to fall back, out of view of the driver. He continued forward, and she tried to scoot back, but was quickly pulled underneath the bulldozer. We ran towards him, and waved our arms and shouted; one activist with the megaphone. But the bulldozer operator continued forward, until Corrie was all the way underneath the central section of the bulldozer.|$|E
25|$|Throughout September3, the {{disturbance}} quickly {{developed in the}} gulf before a wind circulation at the surface beneath the system was detected; thus, the NHC designated the developing system as a tropical depression at 18:00UTC <b>that</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> the storm was 115mi (185km) southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. Following formation, Eleven-E moved slowly towards the northwest and developed a well-pronounced inner rainband late on September3. At 06:00UTC the next day, the depression peaked with winds of 35mph (55km/h) before making landfall an hour later east of Salina Cruz. The cyclone's organized appearance on radar, which included a developing primordial eye, suggested that the depression was near tropical storm intensity {{at the time of}} landfall. A ship documented tropical storm-force winds during this period, but as they were well removed from the storm, its is believed that these stronger winds were associated with a nearby monsoonal wind flow. After moving inland, the depression quickly deteriorated and became a remnant low-pressure area by 18:00UTC on September4 over the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.|$|E

25|$|Arman's company {{engaged in}} battle on 29 October 1936 near Seseña, 30km {{south-west}} of Madrid. Twelve T-26s advanced 35km during the ten-hour raid and inflicted significant losses to Francoists (around two squadrons of Moroccan cavalry and two infantry battalions were defeated; twelve 75mm field guns, four CV-33 tankettes and twenty to thirty trucks with cargo were destroyed or damaged) {{with the loss}} of 3 T-26 tanks to gasoline bombs and artillery fire. The first known instance of ramming in tank warfare was made <b>that</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> the T-26 tank of platoon commander Lt. Semyon Osadchy encountered two Italian CV-33 tankettes from the Nationalist 1st Tank Company near Esquivias village and overturned one of them into a small gorge. Crewmembers of another tankette were killed by tank machine-gun fire after they abandoned their vehicle. The T-26 of captain Arman was burned by a gasoline bomb; although wounded, Arman continued to lead the tank company. Arman's T-26 destroyed one, and damaged two CV-33 tankettes by tank gun fire. On 31 December 1936 captain P. Arman was awarded with the Hero of the Soviet Union for that tank raid and active participation in the defense of Madrid. On 17 November 1936, Arman's company had five T-26 tanks in operable condition.|$|E
25|$|The special {{subcommittee}} met for {{the first}} time on March 3, 1888, and heard testimony in the matter its first day. PHC director L.H. Schneider testified about the organization's 1860 charter, the 1886 amendments to the charter, and Section 3's bar against the construction of roads in the cemetery. Schneider also testified that the city commissioners were well aware of Section 3's prohibition on new roads. City Commissioner Webb reviewed for the subcommittee the city's initial attempt to extend North Capitol Street in late 1886. He noted that the commissioners did not approve construction at that time, as federal law appeared to bar it. Webb claimed that the GESPHC approached the city with news of the subdivision and their willingness to allow the city to cut the road. The city commissioners told the GESPHC that the organization had no authority to subdivide the cemetery or donate any burial ground, and that the city commissioners had never approved the street's extension. Webb claimed that Colonel Ludlow had illegally issued orders sending work crews into the cemetery. Superintendent of Roads Beale testified that Colonel Ludlow verbally ordered him to begin work on December 14, that no countermanding order was ever received, and that work began on the cemetery grounds on December 23. The work ceased at the end of <b>that</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> Ludlow phoned to tell him to stop. Beale also told the subcommittee that it was not until December 29 that Commissioner Wheatley issued a written order to stop work.|$|E
