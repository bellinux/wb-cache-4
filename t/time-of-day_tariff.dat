40|$|Renewable energy {{technologies}} (including solar) have enjoyed {{a period of}} rapid growth in recent years, largely due to government subsidies of various kinds. But renewable {{energy technologies}} cannot expect to replace fossil fuels {{on the back of}} the taxpayers or ratepayers; they will have to become price competitive. Most studies on the economics of renewable energy systems fail to consider one of the most powerful trends in their favor: the rising cost of fossil fuels. This study provides an economic analysis of residential solar systems (photovoltaic and water heating) in Michigan and Hawaii. It shows that residential grid-intertied PV systems are not currently economically attractive in Michigan under any likely assumptions, while higher utility rates and greater solar radiation in Hawaii make a PV system a reasonable investment on economics alone – without government subsidies. Solar water heating systems are very financially attractive in Hawaii and somewhat attractive in Michigan, depending on assumptions about the future rate of utility price escalations. In either location, without government assistance, solar water heaters are more financially attractive than PV systems. Finally, this study examines the effect of using the optional <b>time-of-day</b> <b>tariff</b> offered by one of the major utilities (DTE) and surprisingly finds that the TOD rate structure puts a lower value on the output of either system than the standard flat-rate tariff...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs {{renewable}} energy generating capacity increases on electricity grids, technology {{is needed to}} balance the supply and demand of energy. In order to manage the demand side of electricity, <b>time-of-day</b> (TOD) <b>tariffs</b> are a simple economic mechanism that encourages consumers to smooth the diurnal demand profile by shifting consumption to off-peak times. The management of supply by {{renewable energy}} generators can be achieved using energy storage. This study investigates the use of {{compressed air energy storage}} (CAES) to de-couple a wind energy converter (WEC) from the electricity grid and manage its power output. Numerical and thermodynamic models simulate the operation of the system. One year of operation is simulated using 10 minute WEC time-step data for varying CAES capacities in order to optimize the economic performance of the total system. By selling electricity according to TOD tariff schedules, the income generated by a 0. 8 MW WEC using a 4 MWh CAES system is increased by 30 %. The CAES has a round-trip efficiency of 66 % and annually experiences 450 deep cycles as it stores 25 % of the energy generated by the WEC...|$|R
