5|$|In July 2017, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Executive Order 13795 from President Donald Trump, the U.S. Department of Commerce began re-evaluating the status of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, which includes the Davidson Seamount. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> opposed by many environmentalists and residents.|$|E
5|$|In late August {{and early}} September 1943, the {{division}} redeployed again, {{this time to}} Bihać, relieving the 114th Jäger Division which redeployed to the Adriatic coast. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> difficult, with several significant ambushes resulting in numerous casualties {{and the loss of}} several vehicles and guns.|$|E
5|$|The Kodokan {{moved to}} a 60-mat space in April 1890. In December 1893, the Kodokan started moving to a larger space located in Tomizaka-cho, Koishikawa-cho, and <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} by February 1894.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Daihatsu <b>Move</b> <b>is</b> a kei car, {{produced}} by Japanese automaker Daihatsu since August 1995. <b>The</b> <b>Move</b> <b>is</b> {{designed to be}} as tall as compact cars like the Suzuki Wagon R.

5|$|After {{his move}} to Oxford United in January 2008, {{he stated that}} the reason for <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> so that he could be closer to his family home in Southampton. On his arrival at Exeter City in July 2008, he moved into a house with fellow Exeter forward, Ben Watson. McAllister stated that it would make a huge {{difference}} living near the training ground, instead of travelling long distances to get to training and matches.|$|E
5|$|Another change {{inspired}} by <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> a {{return for the}} Football Echo man. The cartoon character had for years indicated the match results of Sunderland with a smile, a frown or a tear, while adorning the outside wall of the Bridge Street building. After several years in storage, he was returned {{to the wall of}} the new Echo building in 1976, where he still remains today.|$|E
5|$|Attendance was {{in decline}} across the league as the Great Depression took hold. The Habs posted a losing record in 1932–33, leading to still smaller crowds. Averaging only 2,000 fans per game, the team sold Morenz to the Chicago Black Hawks in 1934 {{as part of}} an effort to cut costs. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> not a popular one, and fans voiced their opinion of the deal by giving Morenz a {{standing}} ovation when he scored against the Canadiens on the last day of the 1934–35 season.|$|E
50|$|In the Cambridge rules, this capture <b>is</b> not possible. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> legal, but {{it captures}} {{only the two}} leapers, because <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> not a legal move {{for any of the}} other target pieces. In the absence of the two black leapers, <b>the</b> same <b>move</b> would capture <b>the</b> other five pieces.|$|R
50|$|Book trucks <b>are</b> used to <b>move</b> large {{quantities}} of books. They work well when <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> same library.

5|$|Cho was {{dispatched}} by the Soviet {{authorities to}} liberated Korea when the Red Army entered in 1945. By that time, he had substantial experience with Soviet literature and literature administration. The Soviets hoped that Cho would shape the cultural {{institutions of the}} new state based on the Soviet model. For the Soviets, <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> successful and Cho did not only that but also significantly developed socialist realism as it would become {{the driving force of}} North Korean literature and arts.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Thơ was the Secretary of State for the National Economy. In November, Diệm {{appointed}} Thơ as {{vice president}} {{in an effort to}} widen the regime's popular appeal. The appointment was endorsed by the National Assembly in December 1956, in accordance with the constitution. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> widely seen as an attempt to use Thơ's Mekong Delta roots to increase the government's popular appeal among southern peasants, because Diệm's regime was dominated by family members, Catholics from central Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{independence}} was limited severely by the continuing British {{occupation of the}} country. British influence remained pervasive, {{as evidenced by the}} Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, which almost led to Farouk I's forced abdication. In October 1951, Prime Minister Mustafa el-Nahhas introduced, and Parliament approved, decrees unilaterally abrogating the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and proclaiming Farouk I King of Egypt and the Sudan. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> intended to further Egypt's claims over Sudan, which had been governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium since 1899.|$|E

5|$|Following Derby's relegation {{from the}} Premier League, Higginbotham moved to Southampton in January 2003 on loan {{until the end}} of 2002–03. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> made {{permanent}} in February 2003 for a £1.5million fee. He featured in Southampton's FA Cup run in 2002–03, playing once in the fifth round against Norwich City, but was an unused substitute for the final against Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Following the secession of Virginia {{and that}} state joining the Confederacy, Federal troops marched from Washington into the Arlington region of {{northern}} Virginia. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> intended to forestall any attempt by Virginia militia or Confederate States Army {{to seize the}} capital city of the United States. Over the next seven weeks, forts were constructed {{along the banks of the}} Potomac River and at the approaches to each of the three major bridges (Chain Bridge, Long Bridge, and Aqueduct Bridge) connecting Virginia to Washington and Georgetown.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{and private}} {{enterprises}} have also come {{under pressure from}} China to censor media organizations operated by Falun Gong practitioners. In 2008, for instance, French satellite provider Eutelsat suspended its Asian broadcasts of New Tang Dynasty Television in response to pressure from China's State Administration of Radio, Film and Television. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> viewed as {{a quid pro quo}} attempt to secure access to the Chinese market.|$|E

2500|$|For example, with knights on g1 and d2, {{either of}} which might <b>move</b> to f3, <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> {{specified}} as Ngf3 or Ndf3, as appropriate. With knights on g5 and g1, <b>the</b> <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> N5f3 or N1f3. As above, an [...] "x" [...] can be inserted {{to indicate a}} capture, for example: N5xf3. Another example: two rooks on d3 and h5, either one of which may move to d5. If the rook on d3 moves to d5, {{it is possible to}} disambiguate with either Rdd5 or R3d5, but the file takes precedence over the rank, so Rdd5 is correct. (And likewise if <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>is</b> a capture, Rdxd5 is correct.) ...|$|R

5|$|In 1997, the Orioles signed {{free agent}} shortstop Mike Bordick from the Oakland Athletics and moved Ripken back to third base permanently. General manager Pat Gillick said that <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> made {{not because of}} {{problems}} by Ripken but because more defensive options were available at shortstop than at third base. Had Ripken not wanted {{to move back to}} third base, the Orioles likely would have signed Tim Naehring instead.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014 he was {{reported}} to have agreed terms with South African side Bidvest Wits of the Premier Soccer League, but <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> never completed. He had a trial with Cheltenham Town in March 2015, and impressed in a reserve game against Plymouth Argyle after being out injured for the season, but the club was unable to offer him a contract.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} full season as the Broncos' coach in 1965, Speedie's team posted a 4–10 record. After two losses to begin the 1966 season, Speedie {{resigned}} and assistant Ray Malavasi took over. He said <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> {{in the best interest}} of the club. Speedie had a 6-19-1 record as the Broncos' coach. He then accepted a scouting position with the organization and was based out of his home in Laguna Hills, California. He held the post until his retirement in 1982.|$|E

5|$|In mid-August, Yost moved Braun {{from third}} in the batting order to cleanup, {{switching}} him with Prince Fielder. <b>The</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> expected to allow Braun to steal more, as batting before Fielder was not conducive to him risking being thrown out on steal attempts. Additionally, successfully stealing a base would hypothetically allow opponents to intentionally walk Fielder and avoid pitching to him. At {{the end of the}} month, however, Yost reverted to his previous batting order.|$|E
5|$|In the announcement, McHugh {{denied that}} <b>the</b> <b>move</b> <b>was</b> made in {{response}} to several high-profile misconduct allegations leveled against soldiers from the base in the Afghanistan War such as the Maywand District murders and the Kandahar massacre. Major General Stephen R. Lanza, the Army's chief of public affairs, was tapped to lead the division. It activated on the base on 10 October 2012.
