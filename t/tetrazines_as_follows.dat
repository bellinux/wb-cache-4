40|$|International audienceDonor-acceptor-donor tetrazines {{containing}} ferrocene moieties and phenyl unit as a ð-bridge {{have been}} synthesized and characterized. UV-vis spectroscopic and cyclic voltamperometric results indicate sizable intramolecular charge transfer interactions {{in the ground}} state when the ferrocene is directly bound to the tetrazine. On the other hand, the results show reduction of the electron-donor strength of ferrocene moieties {{when there is a}} phenyl linkage. Both tetrazines display a high reduction potential. The role of ferrocenyl groups appear to be detrimental to maximize the cubic hyperpolarizability ç of <b>tetrazines,</b> <b>as</b> compared to purely organic groups such as thiophene. A possible explanation for this behavior may originate from metalto- ligand charge transfer processes...|$|R
40|$|Pretargeted {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) imaging based on bioorthogonal chemical reactions has proven its potential in immunoimaging. It may also have great potential in nanotheranostic applications. Here, we report the first successful pretargeted PET imaging of trans-cyclooctene-modified mesoporous silicon nanoparticles, using 18 F-labeled <b>tetrazine</b> <b>as</b> a tracer. The inverse electron-demand Diels–Alder cycloaddition (IEDDA) reaction was fast, resulting in high radioactivity accumulation in the expected organs within 10 min after {{the administration of the}} tracer. The highest target-to-background ratio was achieved 120 min after the tracer injection. A clear correlation between the efficiency of the in vivo IEDDA labeling reaction and the injected amount of the tracer was observed. The radioactivity accumulation decreased with the increased amount of the co-injected carrier, indicating saturation in the reaction sites. This finding was supported by the in vitro results. Our study suggests that pretargeted imaging has excellent potential in nanotheranostic PET imaging when using high-specific-activity tracers...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} gating was {{introduced}} into host-guest chemistry by our {{group in the}} 1990 s, {{as a result of}} computational studies on Cram's hemicarcerands. Since that time, a variety of gated host systems have been developed by our group and others. The gated hemicarcerands presented in this dissertation are examples of hosts with controllable gates that function upon external stimuli, which we refer to as redox reaction gated hemicarcerands and photochemically gated hemicarcerands. In both cases, a chemically modifiable moiety was installed on the host molecule so that it undergoes chemical change in response to external stimuli. In particular, we took advantage of disulfide-dithiol interchange (redox reaction control) and anthracene dimerization (photochemical control) to achieve gating in these hemicarcerands. Molecular mechanics computations were employed to understand the experimental observations during the complexation and decomplexation processes. The second part of this dissertation focuses on understanding Diels-Alder reactivities {{of a wide range of}} organic molecules with the tools of computational chemistry. Among these extensively studied molecules, tetrazine is the most outstanding one, in the sense that its cycloaddition reactions with strained alkenes are extremely rapid, with second order rate constants up to 2000 M- 1 s- 1. Such reactions take place at a decent rate even at micromolar concentration, suggesting their application in live cell imaging. The emerging use of <b>tetrazines</b> <b>as</b> labeling reagents has added an extra dimension to bioorthogonal cycloadditions. Our computational studies have provided a thorough understanding of the cycloaddition reactivities and a guideline for developing new reagents...|$|R
