5|$|After Herschel {{discovered}} <b>Titania</b> and Oberon on January 11, 1787, he subsequently {{believed that}} he had observed four other moons: two on January 18 and February 9, 1790, and two more on February 28 and March 26, 1794. It was thus believed for many decades thereafter that Uranus had a system of six satellites, though the four latter moons were never confirmed by any other astronomer. Lassell's observations of 1851, in which he discovered Ariel and Umbriel, however, failed to support Herschel's observations; Ariel and Umbriel, which Herschel certainly ought to have seen if he had seen any satellites beside <b>Titania</b> and Oberon, did not correspond to any of Herschel's four additional satellites in orbital characteristics. Herschel's four spurious satellites were thought to have sidereal periods of 5.89 days (interior to <b>Titania),</b> 10.96 days (between <b>Titania</b> and Oberon), 38.08 days, and 107.69 days (exterior to Oberon). It was therefore concluded that Herschel's four satellites were spurious, probably arising from the misidentification of faint stars {{in the vicinity of}} Uranus as satellites, and the credit for the discovery of Ariel and Umbriel was given to Lassell.|$|E
5|$|Oberon was {{discovered}} by William Herschel on January 11, 1787; {{on the same day}} he discovered Uranus's largest moon, <b>Titania.</b> He later reported the discoveries of four more satellites, although they were subsequently revealed as spurious. For nearly fifty years following their discovery, <b>Titania</b> and Oberon would not be observed by any instrument other than William Herschel's, although the moon can be seen from Earth with a present-day high-end amateur telescope.|$|E
5|$|One {{piece of}} {{evidence}} for such a past resonance is Miranda's unusually high orbital inclination (4.34°) for a body {{so close to the}} planet. The largest Uranian moons may be internally differentiated, with rocky cores at their centers surrounded by ice mantles. <b>Titania</b> and Oberon may harbor liquid water oceans at the core/mantle boundary. The major moons of Uranus are airless bodies. For instance, <b>Titania</b> was shown to possess no atmosphere at a pressure larger than 10–20nanobar.|$|E

50|$|<b>Titania's</b> Palace is a {{miniature}} castle (Dollhouse) that was hand-built in Ireland by James Hicks & Sons, Irish Cabinet Makers, who were commissioned by Sir Nevile Wilkinson from 1907 to 1922. In 1978 <b>Titania's</b> Palace {{went up on}} Auction at Christie's England in 1978 but was lost in a bidding war to Denmark where it remains on display today.|$|R
50|$|Wilkinson built two famous dollhouses, <b>Titania's</b> Palace (completed and inaugurated in 1922 by Queen Mary) and Pembroke Palace (completed in 1907). <b>Titania's</b> Palace {{remained}} in the family for many years, but was sold after 1960 first to an English amusement park, then to Legoland and then to Egeskov Castle. Pembroke Palace Dolls House is now at Wilton House, seat and home of the 18th Earl of Pembroke.|$|R
5|$|So far {{the only}} {{close-up}} images of <b>Titania</b> {{have been from}} the Voyager 2 probe, which photographed the moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Since the closest distance between Voyager 2 and <b>Titania</b> was only , the best images of this moon have a spatial resolution of about 3.4 km (only Miranda and Ariel were imaged with a better resolution). The images cover about 40% of the surface, but only 24% was photographed with the precision required for geological mapping. At {{the time of the}} flyby, the southern hemisphere of <b>Titania</b> (like those of the other moons) was pointed towards the Sun, so the northern (dark) hemisphere could not be studied.|$|E

5|$|<b>Titania</b> orbits Uranus at the {{distance}} of about , being the second farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Titania's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 8.7 days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, <b>Titania</b> is a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always pointing toward the planet.|$|E
5|$|Uranus {{has five}} major moons: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, <b>Titania,</b> and Oberon. They range in {{diameter}} from 472km for Miranda to 1578km for <b>Titania.</b> All these moons are relatively dark objects: their geometrical albedo varies between 30 and 50%, whereas their Bond albedo is between 10 and 23%. Umbriel is the darkest moon and Ariel the brightest. The {{masses of the}} moons range from 6.7kg (Miranda) to 3.5kg (<b>Titania).</b> For comparison, the Moon has a mass of 7.5kg. The major moons of Uranus {{are thought to have}} formed in the accretion disc, which existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or resulted from a large impact suffered by Uranus early in its history.|$|E
5|$|A letter {{describing}} the original performance {{shows that the}} parts of <b>Titania</b> and Oberon were played by children of eight or nine. Presumably other fairies were also played by children; this affects our perspective on the staging.|$|E

50|$|<b>Titania's</b> body is {{also highly}} {{resistant}} to physical injury. She can withstand high caliber bullets, temperature extremes, falls from great heights, and severe blunt force trauma without sustaining injury.|$|R
5|$|Among Uranus's moons, <b>Titania</b> is {{intermediate}} {{in brightness}} between the dark Oberon and Umbriel {{and the bright}} Ariel and Miranda. Its surface shows a strong opposition surge: its reflectivity decreases from 35% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 25% at an angle of about 1°. <b>Titania</b> has a relatively low Bond albedo of about 17%. Its surface is generally slightly red in color, but less red than that of Oberon. However, fresh impact deposits are bluer, while the smooth plains situated on the leading hemisphere near Ursula crater and along some grabens are somewhat redder. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the former appears to be redder than the latter by 8%. However, this difference {{is related to the}} smooth plains and may be accidental. The reddening of the surfaces probably results from space weathering caused by bombardment by charged particles and micrometeorites over the age of the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of <b>Titania</b> is more likely related to accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly, from irregular satellites, which would be deposited predominately on the leading hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The Uranian {{satellite}} {{system is the}} least massive among those of the giant planets. Indeed, the combined mass of the five major satellites {{is less than half}} that of Triton (the seventh-largest moon in the Solar System) alone. The largest of the satellites, <b>Titania,</b> has a radius of 788.9km, or less than half that of the Moon, but slightly more than that of Rhea, the second-largest moon of Saturn, making <b>Titania</b> the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System. Uranus is about 10,000times more massive than its moons.|$|E
5|$|The Uranian {{system has}} been studied up close only once, by the {{spacecraft}} Voyager 2 in January 1986. It took several images of <b>Titania,</b> which allowed mapping of about 40% of its surface.|$|E

50|$|The underbidders at the London auction {{were deeply}} {{disappointed}} at <b>Titania's</b> Palace being lost to Ireland. They commissioned a new palace, a dollhouse called Tara's Palace, {{which is on}} display in the Tara's Palace Museum of Childhood, located in Powerscourt Estate, near Enniskerry, County Wicklow, Ireland.|$|R
5|$|The {{first two}} moons to be {{discovered}} were <b>Titania</b> and Oberon, which were spotted by Sir William Herschel on January 11, 1787, six years after he had discovered the planet itself. Later, Herschel thought he had discovered up to six moons (see below) and perhaps even a ring. For nearly 50years, Herschel's instrument {{was the only one}} with which the moons had been seen. In the 1840s, better instruments and a more favorable position of Uranus in the sky led to sporadic indications of satellites additional to <b>Titania</b> and Oberon. Eventually, the next two moons, Ariel and Umbriel, were discovered by William Lassell in 1851. The Roman numbering scheme of Uranus's moons {{was in a state of}} flux for a considerable time, and publications hesitated between Herschel's designations (where <b>Titania</b> and Oberon are Uranus II and IV) and William Lassell's (where they are sometimes I and II). With the confirmation of Ariel and Umbriel, Lassell numbered the moons I through IV from Uranus outward, and this finally stuck. In 1852, Herschel's son John Herschel gave the four then-known moons their names.|$|E
5|$|Because Uranus orbits the Sun {{almost on}} its side, and its moons orbit in the planet's {{equatorial}} plane, they (including <b>Titania)</b> {{are subject to}} an extreme seasonal cycle. Both northern and southern poles spend 42 years in a complete darkness, and another 42 years in continuous sunlight, with the sun rising close to the zenith {{over one of the}} poles at each solstice. The Voyager 2 flyby coincided with the southern hemisphere's 1986 summer solstice, when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was unilluminated. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus's moons become possible. In 2007–2008 a number of such events were observed including two occultations of <b>Titania</b> by Umbriel on August 15 and December 8, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Both Ariel and the {{slightly}} larger Uranian satellite Umbriel were discovered by William Lassell on 24 October 1851. Although William Herschel, who discovered Uranus's two largest moons <b>Titania</b> and Oberon in 1787, {{claimed to have}} observed four additional moons, this was never confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious.|$|E
5|$|<b>Titania's</b> orbit lies {{completely}} {{inside the}} Uranian magnetosphere. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet. This bombardment {{may lead to}} the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below).|$|R

Its art design is eccentric, featuring a forest of floating light bulbs and a giant umbrella for <b>Titania's</b> bower.|$|R
5000|$|Skerrit is {{the deity}} worshipped by the centaur race. Skerrit {{is also known}} as the [...] "Forester." [...] His symbol is an oak growing from an acorn. Skerrit may appear as any {{creature}} of the forest. Sometimes his spirit will temporarily possess various plants and animals in order to do his will. In his centaur form, Skerrit wields a bow and a spear. When he is in the forest, the branches and leaves of the trees move to impede his foes' attacks. Skerrit is a member of <b>Titania's</b> Seelie Court. He is part of the Outer Circle of the Seelie Court. Skerrit's Glade is located on the Outer Plane of the Beastlands, near Ehlonna's Grove of the Unicorns. Though he is probably the best known member of <b>Titania's</b> Seelie Court, he prefers to maintain his own realm separately. Skerrit is worshipped mainly by centaurs and satyrs, and by those sylvan elves who are more neutral in alignment.|$|R
5|$|It begins after Oberon {{has ordered}} Puck to anoint {{the eyes of}} Demetrius with the love-juice. <b>Titania</b> and her fairies merrily revel ("Come all ye songsters of the sky"), and Night ("See, even Night"), Mystery ("Mystery's song"), Secrecy ("One charming night") and Sleep ("Hush, no more, be silent all") lull them asleep and leave them to {{pleasant}} dreams.|$|E
5|$|No other {{spacecraft}} {{has ever}} visited the Uranian system or <b>Titania,</b> and no mission is currently planned. One possibility, now discarded, was to send Cassini on from Saturn to Uranus in an extended mission. Another mission concept proposed was the Uranus orbiter and probe concept, evaluated around 2010. Uranus was also examined {{as part of}} one trajectory for a precursor interstellar probe concept, Innovative Interstellar Explorer.|$|E
5|$|The geology of <b>Titania</b> was {{influenced}} by two competing forces: impact crater formation and endogenic resurfacing. The former acted over the moon's entire history and influenced all surfaces. The latter processes were also global in nature, but active mainly for a period following the moon's formation. They obliterated the original heavily cratered terrain, explaining the relatively low number of impact craters on the moon's present-day surface. Additional episodes of resurfacing may have occurred later {{and led to the}} formation of smooth plains. Alternatively smooth plains may be ejecta blankets of the nearby impact craters. The most recent endogenous processes were mainly tectonic in nature and caused the formation of the canyons, which are actually giant cracks in the ice crust. The cracking of the crust was caused by the global expansion of <b>Titania</b> by about 0.7%.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{comparing}} the photocatalytic efficiencies of various TiO 2 based photocatalysts for phenol degradation and bacteria inactivation under illumination with visible light. Commercial undoped anatase and rutile (both from Aldrich), Aeroxide P 25 (Evonik Industries), nitrogen-doped anatase (Sumitomo TP-S 201, Sumitomo Chemical Inc.), nitrogen and sulphur co-doped anatase (Kronos VLP 7000, Kronos Titan GmbH), and our custom-synthesized nitrogen- and iron-doped TiO 2, {{as well as}} nitrogen and sulphur co-doped Aeroxide P 25 and silver- and gold-deposited Aeroxide P 25 were studied. The photocatalytic efficiency {{of different types of}} titanium dioxide based photocatalysts was determined by inactivation of Escherichia coli K 12 bacteria and by phenol decomposition. Electron spin resonance (ESR) in combination with spin trapping was used to get insight into the reactive oxygen species (ROS) -mediated photocatalytic processes in the presence of TiO 2 -based photocatalysts. ESR results confirmed that <b>titanias</b> which generated OH radicals were efficient in E. coli disinfection, whereas <b>titanias</b> that were unable to produce OH radicals did not reveal significant bactericidal action. Three of our home-made <b>titanias</b> (iron-, nitrogen-, nitrogen/sulphur) as well as the commercial nitrogen/sulphur codoped Kronos VLP 7000 TiO 2 showed higher efficiency of phenol degradation than the well-established reference photocatalyst, Aeroxide P 25, but showed much lower (if any) activity for bacteria inactivation, including Kronos VLP 7000, which revealed extremely high efficiency for phenol decomposition. Interestingly undoped Aldrich rutile (with large particles - 100 - 700 nm) had the highest efficiency for inactivation of E. coli and also had fairly high activity of phenol degradation. © 2012 Elsevier B.
