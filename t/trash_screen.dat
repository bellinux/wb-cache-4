40|$|The {{construction}} of a culvert within a river channel alters the local hydraulic characteristics which often increases upstream water elevation {{as a result of}} the volume of water being constricted as it enters the culvert. This effect can be exacerbated if there is a build up of debris either at the inlet or trapped within the culvert. As a consequence culverts, especially those which are prone to becoming blocked, may considerably increase the potential for out of channel flows and therefore the risk of serious flooding. While trash screens may be fitted at a culvert inlet to prevent debris from entering, unless they are well designed and maintained they may increase the potential for flooding if they become blocked by trapping debris that would have passed unrestricted through the culvert. Guidelines for screen design focus mainly on ensuring sufficient screen area is provided to handle the expected debris load, while recommendations for individual screen elements, such as bar spacing, are generally based on anecdotal evidence and site specific environmental or safety concerns. However, many different <b>trash</b> <b>screen</b> configurations can influence blockage potential. To gain a better understanding of how blockage, and therefore any potential associated flood risk, of culvert trash screens is influenced by screen geometry and position, a Froude-scaled physical model was developed to facilitate assessment of the efficiency of different <b>trash</b> <b>screen</b> configurations. To minimize scaling issues related to complex geometry, and to ensure the focus of the research remained on the influence of screen design rather than on factors specific to the debris, wooden dowel was used to represent different debris lengths. Detailed analysis based on 147, 000 debris passes is used to show that, as would be expected, potential for screen blockage by debris increases as the ratio of debris length to bar spacing increases. However, in addition, a key finding has been that the screen position relative to the zone of flow acceleration created as the flow is constricted on approach to the culvert inlet is a significant driving factor in the blocking potential of the screen. Detailed statistical analysis was used to define blockage potential in terms of all contributing factors. The derived model was used to develop end user focussed tools, a nomograph and an interactive spreadsheet, to aid estimation of blockage at a screen for a given geometry and position...|$|E

They {{are driven by}} electric motors or water-powered paddle wheels. The screens are particularly useful for automated irrigation systems. The head loss is small, {{and they are not}} adversely affected when the farm delivery is terminated by automated downstream valve closures while canal turnouts remain open. Different screens, bearings, and bushings were tested for this application. Hydraulic tests were conducted to determine head losses with different wheel screens...|$|R
40|$|Baffle {{boxes are}} {{concrete}} or fiberglass structures containing {{a series of}} sediment settling chambers separated by baffles. The primary function of baffle boxes is to remove sediment, suspended particles, and associated pollutants from storm water. Baffle boxes may also contain <b>trash</b> <b>screens</b> or skimmers to capture larger materials, trash, and floatables. Baffle boxes are located either in-line or {{at the end of}} storm pipes. Figure 1 shows a typical baffle box design. The use of baffle boxes for pollutant removal is based on the concept of slowing the flow velocity through the box, thereby allowing solids and associated pollutants to settle {{to the bottom of the}} box. Storm water enters the box and begins to fill the first chamber. As water encounters the baffles, flow velocity decreases, allowing particles with a settling velocity greater than the horizontal flow velocity to settle to the bottom of the box. In addition to decreasing flow velocities, the baffles impede particle movement. As suspended solids strike the baffles they begin to settle. Larger particles usually settle out first and accumulate in the first chambers while smaller particles usually settle out in subsequent chambers. MANHOLES MANHOLE...|$|R
40|$|The Sherburne Generating Plant of the Northern States Power Company {{is located}} 40 miles NW of Minneapolis. Plant Units 1 and 2 {{were placed in}} service in 1976 and 1977. Proposed Units 3 and 4 of 800 Mw {{capacity}} each were scheduled for commercial operation in the early 1980 's. Proposed design improvements in the circulating cooling water systems. for Units 3 and 4 involved complex hydraulic flows. To assure performance, hydraulic model studies were undertaken. This report details the studies of a 1 : 12 model which were made at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory. In normal operations, heated water from the condensers is elevated {{to the top of}} forced draft cooling towers where it is released to spray downward for cooling. Start-up during sub freezing weather could lead to damaging freeze-up in the cooling tower. An added 84 inch diameter temporary cold weather by-pass drops the 168, 000 gpm flow a distance of over 40 feet and requires a dispersed manifold port system assuring good energy dissipation and a stable, well-distributed flow into the tower basin. Based on initial model studies, several small changes were made in the original design to achieve the desired flow quality. Flow in the coaling system is maintained by two 5, 000 HP pumps drawing from a pump basin supplied by two cooling towers. The basin serves to route flow from either or both towers to either or both pumps. There was a concern that flow asymmetries or vortices detrimental to pump performance might be generated in the pump basin. Extensive tests at the model pump suction using pitots and vortex sensors establish that good flow conditions existed for all routings and no modification of the basin design was needed. Separate considerations were given to the influence of <b>trash</b> <b>screens</b> and fire water pumping and the dispersion of additive acid in the pump basin. Northern States Power Compan...|$|R
40|$|Rubbish trap is devises used {{to prevent}} large items polluting waterways. They are used in {{stormwater}} drains, urban wetlands, river and other locations. They generally collected larger items from the water, such as take away containers, leaves, bottles and plastic bags. The purpose {{of this research is}} to determine the efficiency of rubbish trap in terms of the trapping rubbish and water quality improvement as well as to evaluate the efficiency of perforated wallâ€™s rubbish traps and to compared with existing mesh type in terms of trapping litter or rubbish. A laboratory test are also conducted to study the rubbish traps characteristic in four difference types of scale rubbish modelling in various discharge and quantity of artificial rubbish collected. Data taken from laboratory test are energy loss and backwater flow. The study is based on rubbish trap at L 52 and <b>trash</b> <b>screen</b> at L 50 which is located at UTM campus and rubbish trap at Taman Universiti, Skudai. From the results obtained, rubbish trap at L 52, L 50 and Taman Universiti shows the effectiveness to trap rubbish and sediment where it can reduce the amount of suspended solids in water. However, the existing rubbish trap (mesh type) is more effective than new rubbish trap (perforated) ...|$|E
40|$|There {{are three}} species of lamprey in the UK; the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, the river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis and the brook lamprey Lampetra planeri. All three {{are found in}} the River Tay. They are all {{included}} in Annex II of the European Habitats Directive 92 / 43 /EEC and are designated species in the River Tay SAC. Stanley Mills is a small scale run-of-river hydro-electric power station which takes water from the River Tay, upstream of Perth. This project aimed {{to assess the impact of}} Stanley Mills power station on downstream-migrating lamprey. Sea and river lamprey are typically anadromous species. They spawn in fresh water where the ammocoetes (larvae) remain for several years before transforming into parasitic adults and migrating to the sea. The concern is that downstream migrating lamprey may travel into the water intake for the hydropower station and either become impinged on trash screens or damaged by passing through the turbine itself. Sampling was carried out through the main expected period of emigration (September to March). Debris from the <b>trash</b> <b>screen</b> was checked for lamprey. Nets were set in the outflow from the power station while the turbine was both running and turned off to catch lamprey which had passed through the turbines or the bywash. All lamprey were identified, measured and their condition assesse...|$|E
40|$|Francisella tularensis is a Gram-negative {{pathogenic}} organism {{that causes the}} disease tularemia. This disease can be potentially fatal without treatment. Francisella tularensis virulent strains can cause disease in humans with an infectious dose as low as 10 organisms. As {{a result of this}} low infectious dose, high mortality, and ease to produce an aerosol inoculum, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has classified Francisella tularensis as a Tier I select agent, the highest threat level. Much research has been done to determine the cause for the extreme virulence. However, despite these efforts, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms by which Francisella goes undetected inside host cells until it is too late for the host to respond. Researchers in the Jones 2 ̆ 7 laboratory utilized a transposon site hybridization (<b>TraSH)</b> <b>screen</b> with human monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) as the host cell and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screen of pools of transposon mutants searching for virulence determinants and genes responsible for Francisella capsule or LPS. Through the <b>TraSH</b> <b>screen,</b> our group identified a locus of genes, FTT 1236, FTT 1237, and FTT 1238 c as being important for survival within human MDMs. From the mutant library screen using ELISA, I identified the same genes, FTT 1236 and FTT 1238 c. In addition, I also identified wzy, wbtA, FTT 0846, and hemH as being involved in LPS and or capsule production. A similar ELISA screen was done by researchers in Apicella laboratory using a different monoclonal antibody that identified insertions in, dnaJ, manB and an intergenic region between FTT 0673 and FTT 0674 c that potentially disrupted LPS and capsule biogenesis. Previously, FTT 1236, FTT 1237, and FTT 1238 c mutants were observed by our laboratory to be serum sensitive and activate MDMs by an unknown mechanism. I further characterized these mutant strains by analyzing the changes in the LPS core. I identified core truncations for the FTT 1236 and FTT 1237 mutants, but not FTT 1238 c. Combining this new data with previously published work and bioinformatical analysis of the FTT 1236, FTT 1237 and FTT 1238 c proteins, I hypothesized that these proteins have functions similar to Waa proteins of other organisms, which are involved in LPS core assembly and O-antigen ligation. With functional complementation and mass spectrometry of LPS preparations, I have designated FTT 1236, FTT 1237, and FTT 1238 c as WaaY, WaaZ, and WaaL respectively. In addition to this work characterizing the biochemical functions of these gene products, I examined the effect of mutations in these genes on the virulence of Francisella. In contrast to infection with wild type Schu S 4, mice infected either intraperitoneally or intranasally displayed significant inflammatory responses to infection and the strains were significantly attenuated by either route of infection. I also observed that waaY and waaL mutant strains disseminated to the liver and spleen after an intranasal infection despite their lack of O-antigen and capsule. At an i. n. dose of 106 CFU these mutant strains still caused lethal murine infection, but death occurred around day 12 post infection; mice infected with 3 ̆c 20 CFU of Schu S 4 succumb at day 5 post infection. The cause of the death in mice infected with these mutant strains was pulmonary edema, rather than multiple organ failure induced by Schu S 4. Of the additional seven mutant strains identified from the ELISA screens, I characterized their physical phenotypes, virulence defects, and their potential as an attenuated live vaccine. All of these strains were determined to be sensitive to human pooled serum to various degrees. Three of these strains, dnaJ::Tn 5, hemH::Tn 5, and FTT 0673 p/prsAp::Tn 5 did not have identifiable defects in capsule or LPS biosynthesis, nor were they attenuated in mice. The remaining four strains, FTT 0846 ::Tn 5, manB::Tn 5, wzy::Tn 5, and wbtA::Tn 5, were found to have LPS O-antigen and capsule defects, and two of these strains had LPS core defects (FTT 0846 ::Tn 5 and manB::Tn 5). Each of these four strains was attenuated in mice, when compared to WT. I also tested the ability of mice infected with waaY::TrgTn, waaL::TrgTn, and wbt::Tn 5 to be protected from lethal challenges of Schu S 4. All three strains provided some level of protection against lethal Schu S 4 challenges. In addition, I also tested Francisella LPS and capsule to provide protection against lethal challenges of LVS and Schu S 4. I determined that LPS and capsule protected against high doses of LVS, but LPS did not provide any protection when immunized mice were challenged with Schu S 4. Interestingly, we observed that mice immunized with capsule were partially protected from lethal Schu S 4 challenges. In addition, I observed a novel difference between virulent Francisella strains and LVS, in that virulent strains have O-antigen glycosylated and LVS appears to be lacking this characteristic. Collectively, this work adds to the growing data of the importance of LPS and the role of capsule role in immune evasion as well as the significance of capsule and LPS mutant strains to provide protection against Schu S 4...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The river Wupper {{is one of}} the prioritywaters {{catchment}} areas for anadromous and potamodromous fish in the German federal state North Rhine-Westfalia. The survey took place at a small hydropower facility named “Auer Kotten” and its different fish ways and protection facilities, like a vertical slot fish pass and a natural like rockpool channel, three different bypass types and a 12 mm-horizontal screen. Sixteen HDX-antennas were installed by Institute of Applied Ecology to identify the preferred migration routes of transponder tagged fish several species. An HDX-Antenna works like an electrified coil, which creates an electro magnetic field trough to the antenna. So tagged fish enter the antenna the transponder is activated and emits an individual code, which is registered by the antenna and archived by data logger time-, location- and individual-precise. In autumn 2013 nearly three-hundred silver eels were tagged intraabdominal with transponders and released upstream the hydropower plant in the Wupper. Additionally 999 smolts of Atlantic salmon were released in spring 2014. The preferred migration corridors as well as the time for passing the different facilities could be identified by a redetection of 77 % of the silver eel and 68 % of the salmon smolts. As one of the results it was shown that neither the two surface bypasses, nor the bottom bypass were used properly by the downstream migrating fish. In opposite the vertical slot fish pass and a episodically working gate next to the <b>trash</b> rack <b>screen,</b> to send debris into the trailwater were often passed, sometimes maybe forced. Moreover wild fish of different species were caught ca. 20 km downstream the “Auer Kotten” by electro-fishing, tagged and released to get information about the preferred upstream migration routes. Most of the so far redetected fish arrived in the trailwater of the turbine outlet, while just lamprey preferred to swim into the original river bed. The results of the survey points out that the HDX-technology is perfect for field studies on the migratory behaviour of fish, even an intensive maintenance is needed f. e. to protect the installations for demages caused by high floods...|$|R
