40|$|Robotic {{mobility}} {{within the}} gastrointestinal (GI) tract is an intriguing concept, which has received wide attention {{from within the}} research community {{over the past ten}} years. Capsule endoscopes (CEs) exist commercially, but lack an active mobility system, rendering them as passive devices. These passive devices are only capable of observational procedures, and are limited by the passive speed (dependent on intestinal peristalsis), inability to control orientation, and vulnerability to retention, requiring surgical removal in severe cases. Additionally, passive capsules take photos throughout their journey, resulting in a compilation of thousands of images, which can take the attending physician hours to review. Due to these drawbacks, traditional endoscopes remain as the most popular intervention for GI related procedures. A traditional endoscope consists of a long flexible tube with a camera on the end of it. The tube usually has ports for tools, insufflation and irrigation. A user interface is located on the operator end of the scope, and can be manipulated to steer the tip of the scope. The scope is inserted through the oral or rectal orifice and is advanced by pushing the scope. As the scope is pushed, frictional forces can accumulate, resulting in advancement of the body of scope without advancement of the tip, termed looping. Looping results in distention of the bowel wall, pain for the patient and in rare cases perforation. A robotic capsule endoscope (RCE) for oral endoscopies or robotic capsule colonoscope (RCC) for rectal colonoscopies is a capsular device (tethered or non-tethered) that propels itself through the GI tract. Self-propulsion could result in less looping, less pain for the patient, more ergonomic operation for the physician, control over capsule position and orientation, and the addition of diagnostic and therapeutic tools over existing passive CEs. This work focuses on the contact mechanics of robot-tissue interaction in the GI tract with the goal of furthering the understanding of the physical problem so that more efficient and optimized mobility systems may be designed for RCEs and RCCs. This work also focuses on the design of an RCC which uses micro-patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) treads as a mobility method. The thesis is divided into nine chapters. Chapter 1 provides an overview of capsule and flexible endoscope technology as it relates to screening, diagnostics and therapy. A thorough overview of existing mobility methods (both commercial and experimental) for RCEs is also presented along with a background on micro-patterning for friction enhancement. Chapter 2 presents the qualitative analysis of micro-patterned treads through the development and in vivo testing of a series of two-wheeled robots as well as a testing apparatus for quantitatively evaluating micro-patterned robotic wheels in a static environment. Chapter 3 presents the development of a novel testing apparatus for evaluating robotic wheels in a dynamic environment, and results from data collected using the apparatus. The results from this device suggested that an automated dynamic testing environment would be necessary for deeper understanding of robot-tissue interaction. Chapter 4 presents the development of an automated traction measurement (ATM) platform for evaluation of robotic wheels on synthetic or biological tissue substrates as a function of normal force, rotational velocity and linear velocity. An empirical model for predicting traction force was also developed and validated using data collected from the ATM platform. Chapter 5 presents a study on the relationship between substrate height (i. e., stiffness), robot wheel <b>tread</b> pillar <b>diameter,</b> and the resulting generated traction force using the ATM platform for experimental collection and finite element modeling for validation. Chapter 6 presents the design and in vivo testing of an RCC which utilizes micro-patterned treads as a mobility method. The tethered prototype featured an onboard camera, and white and infrared (IR) light sources. Chapter 7 presents the development and experimental validation of an analytical model for predicting the drag force necessary to move a cylindrical capsule endoscope through the GI tract. Chapters 8 and 9 address discussion, conclusions, and future work. The work in this thesis has advanced the understanding of the contact mechanics for robot-tissue interface, especially pertaining to micro-patterned surfaces, and has resulted in several tools, both hardware and software, for measuring and modeling traction and drag force for capsule endoscope mobility methods. Additionally, this work has resulted in a novel RCC design prototype, which has the potential to evolve into a clinically viable device...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{includes}} some basic knowledge {{to be considered}} when discussing {{about the quality of}} work in harvesting wood and how to monitor it. This knowledge may aid to form an appropriate view on mechanised logging, environmental issues and trade of forest products. Many forest owners feel today, that leaving a good quality of work behind is the most important requirement set for logging machinery in the future. It is possible to present to the forest machine and equipment manufacturers some ideas on how to promote and influence the development of logging machines and equipment. This paper is partly based on a literature study, partly on theme interviews. Recent literature on productivity, machine and method studies on logging was examined from the quality of work point of view. Observations supporting an improvement in the quality of work were recorded. The idea was not to find out the level of the quality of work in practice as such, but to assess the relationships between the methods, machines and equipment used in respect to the quality of work. The interviews were conducted from May 22, 2000 to October 2, 2000 in Finland. The data consisted of six persons responsible for logging in a wood procurement district, six representatives of forest machine manufacturers and five logging contractors. A good quality of work in logging is characterised by doing it in an agreed way. Indicators for reaching the goals are evaluated by assessing the damages caused to the remaining trees, the rut formation, the strip road spacing and width, the way the thinning regimes are followed and the choice of trees to be cut. The target level is formed as a joint effect e. g. of efficiency in wood production, of credibility of mechanised operations, of considering the environment and of fluency in trade of forest products. Contributing factors to reach a good quality of work are the organisation of the logging, the forest machine operator as well as the machine and equipment technique. These factors may get a weighting value. However, the final result is a product of these factors, and all of them have to be considered. When looking at the situation today the human influence in logging, especially the role of the operator, is getting more emphasis. On the other hand, in the long run the possibilities to develop appropriate technologies are dominating, especially the use of new technologies. From {{the point of view of}} logging machinery the main factors affecting the work results, are the mobility of the vehicle, how to operate it and the work environment. In this paper, based on the development needs and possibilities, those aspects are looked at. An assessment of the present state is given and presents a basis for a more precise prediction of realistic targets. Based on a literature review and interviews conducted, it is possible to conclude, that there still is great potential to improve the quality of work in logging. Some direct technical improvements could promote the quality of work, but there are even some other actions, which indirectly through the operator would have a positive effect. An improved quality of work is often also improving the productivity in work. Furthermore it makes the organising of the logging operations easier and makes it possible to operate in a more demanding work environment even year around and 24 hours a day. The following is a list of research and development (R&D) needs concerning forest machinery, where inputs would be justified: •	Better visibility (illumination, no dazzling, visibility) •	Analysis of the CTI-system and eventual construction and testing of a test machine •	The properties of tyres (width, <b>diameter,</b> <b>tread,</b> pressure) and their development •	Control of the crane and its development (e. g. the automatic functions) •	The role of a rotating cab on the operator, his productivity and the work result •	Research into the role of levelling (seat, cabin, whole machine) •	Steering of the machine (turning radius, “cutting” of corners) and possibilities to develop a vehicle with frame-steering and turning wheels •	Research into the possibilities to utilise on-board weighing scales •	Lighter machine construction •	The role of tracks and comparison of different tracks •	The role of a balanced boggie and its comparison with a single wheel •	The role of the size of the harvester head on the operation control, work result and productivity •	Possibilities to increase automation •	Possibilities of work rotation and its effect on a normal logging system •	The effect of a harwarder (harvester-forwarder) on the operator’s work 28 p...|$|R
