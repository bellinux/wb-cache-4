5|$|As {{predicted}} {{through the}} actions of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film, there were numerous news reports of underage South Park fans engaging in unsuccessful attempts to gain entrance to the film at theaters. There were reports of adolescents purchasing tickets for WB's own Wild Wild West and instead sitting in to see South Park. This came {{as a result of}} a movie-industry crackdown that would make it tougher for children to sneak into R-rated films, as proposed by President Bill Clinton at the time in response to the moral panic generated by the Columbine High School massacre, which occurred two months before the film's release. South Park was cited, along with American Pie, as an explicit film released in the summer of 1999 tempting teens to sneak into theaters. When the film was released in the United Kingdom in August 1999, there were similar reports of the film drawing an underage crowd.|$|E

5|$|Football is {{a popular}} {{participatory}} sport among youth. One of the earliest youth football organizations was founded in Philadelphia, in 1929, as the Junior Football Conference. Organizer Joe Tomlin started the league to provide activities and guidance for teenage boys who were vandalizing the factory he owned. The original four-team league expanded to sixteen teams in 1933 when Pop Warner, {{who had just been}} hired as the new coach of the Temple University football team, agreed to give a lecture to <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league. In his honor, the league was renamed the Pop Warner Conference.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Robert McSpadden and Bill Dickinson, both music {{teachers}} in the Cincinnati Public Schools, founded the Cincinnati All-City Boy Choir, where they were struck by how the discipline they established for <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> choir carried over into their academic studies. They conceived {{the idea of a}} school where basic education was combined with intensive attention to children with artistic talents. With the support of Waldrip and Tom Murray, director for the west-central division of Cincinnati elementary schools, they pushed for $119,000 as part of a tax levy referendum in May 1973; the measure was defeated. The school was approved with a drastically reduced budget of $27,000 plus $9,850 from the Board of Education’s general fund. They turned to private funding and won a $292,000 grant from J. Ralph Corbett, one of the city's foremost philanthropists for the arts, and $24,500 for a piano lab from the Baldwin Piano Company, which had manufactured pianos in Cincinnati since 1891.|$|E

25|$|Nothing {{is known}} about his origin, but he first appears in the cathedral of Chartres as a boy singer in 1462. He became choirmaster of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chartres choir school in 1469, which makes a birthdate of 1450 a fair approximation. In 1472 he became a canon. Between March and November 1483 he made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, being {{replaced}} in his duties at Chartres by the young Antoine Brumel (this is the earliest mention of this renowned composer). The following year Mureau made another pilgrimage, this one to Santiago de Compostela.|$|E
25|$|There are {{accounts}} of protection {{offered to the}} minorities by their fellow citizens that were successful in fending off the mob. The most organized team rallied behind air force captain Reşat Mater. Mater happened to be off duty and visiting his home in Cevizli's Muhasebeciler Street, which was {{right next to the}} rally point, İstanbul Caddesi. Mater first hid some of his neighbors in his house, then he took to the street with his gun and his uniform. <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood joined him, bringing domestic implements as substitute weapons. The mob passed by after seeing the barricade.|$|E
25|$|The first {{explicitly}} pornographic {{film with}} a plot that received a general theatrical release in the U.S. {{is generally considered}} to be Mona the Virgin Nymph (also known as Mona), a 59-minute 1970 feature by Bill Osco and Howard Ziehm, who went on to create the relatively high-budget hardcore/softcore (depending on the release) cult film Flesh Gordon. The 1971 film Boys in the Sand represented a number of pornographic firsts. As the first generally available gay pornographic film, the film was the first to include on-screen credits for its cast and crew (albeit largely under pseudonyms), to parody the title of a mainstream film (in this case, <b>The</b> <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Band), and to be reviewed by The New York Times. In 1972, pornographic films hit their public peak in the United States with both Deep Throat and Behind the Green Door being met with public approval and becoming social phenomena.|$|E

25|$|The {{isolated}} {{figures are}} given statuesque but largely unmodeled treatment, and their skin and their clothes are clean, with a waxy finish. They appear unselfconscious, {{at ease in}} their environment, and—with {{the possible exception of}} the boy to the bottom right—are locked in a pensive and solitary reverie. Horizontal and vertical lines at the middle and far distance contrast with arched backs and the relaxed postures of the figures toward the front. These postures, angles of heads, directions of gaze, and positions of limbs are repeated among the figures, giving the group a rhythmic unity. Distinctively coloured forms in close proximity, such as the grouping of horse-chestnut colours of the clothes on the bank, and the grouping of oranges of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water, add to the stability of the work—an effect reinforced in the cluster of shadows to the left on the bank, and the un-verisimilar play of light around the bathing figures.|$|E
500|$|James' {{participation}} in the Flemingdon Park league ended partway through her second year due to jealousy from the parents of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league. The president's son was on James' team, and was particularly offended that his boy was being overshadowed by a girl. [...] He ordered {{a change in the}} league's policy to forbid girls from playing.|$|E
500|$|In 1518 William Atwater, Bishop of Lincoln, visited {{to inspect}} the abbey. The Abbot, Richard Pescall, was, like Sadyngton, accused of {{financial}} impropriety, but also {{was thought to be}} too old to perform his duties. Pescall's extravagances included an [...] "excessive number of hounds", which were known to roam freely [...] "fouling church, chapter house and cloister"; whilst the Bishop complained <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> almonry were being improperly educated.|$|E

He also complied with the customary obligation of a son giving his father all earnings from work done outside the home until the age of twenty-one. Abraham became adept at using an axe. Tall for his age, Lincoln was also strong and athletic. He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as [...] "the Clary's Grove boys".|$|E
500|$|Reviewers of [...] "Here's to Us" [...] {{differed}} on {{what they}} felt worked and didn't.

Votta called the number [...] "pretty" [...] but said the placement of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> balconies was [...] "cute but not really compelling as a staged performance". Slezak stated that it was [...] "hard to find any fault with Lea Michele's vocal performances" [...] and gave it a [...] "B+", and Futterman wrote, [...] "It's bouyant [...] and celebratory, and Rachel kills it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{youngest}} of ten children, Domínguez {{was born in}} Mexico City, Mexico, {{and grew up in}} the rural suburb of Chalco. [...] Despite the perception of sport by her father, she played when young football with her three brothers, though her father did not approve: [...] "My father was very old-fashioned, and he didn't like soccer. He didn't even like that my brothers played soccer. When he went to work, I would sneak out of the house to go and practice in the street." [...] Domínguez did not find a girls' team to play on until she was a teenager. Domínguez fooled <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood she grew up in into playing with her by keeping her hair short like a boy. They called her Mario and only found out that she was a girl when her picture appeared in the newspaper after she made it on the sub-national women's team.|$|E

500|$|Fujimoto {{argues that}} the story has overly {{traditional}} gender roles, noting [...] " [...] its representations suggest that men are {{men and women are}} women and that they differ naturally regarding aptitude and vocation". For example, the girls initially outperform <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ninja Academy, but [...] "once the boys get serious, the girls cannot keep pace". [...] Fujimoto points out that this does not upset Sakura, who is now surpassed by Naruto. [...] Character development based on female roles, when it does occur, again uses stereotypical roles: Tsunade, for example, a middle-aged woman with large breasts, is a clear mother figure, and when she teaches Sakura to be a medical ninja, which requires special skills possessed only by women, the story reinforces the idea that women only belong on the battlefield as healers. [...] Tsunade herself, who is a figure of authority in Naruto, is portrayed as ridiculous in a way that men in the same position are not. [...] Fujimoto suggests this presentation of women may explain why the female characters are often the most disliked characters among readers of the manga.|$|E
500|$|Later, a {{group of}} {{students}} go out into the woods at night to play with black magic, an attempt to [...] "score" [...] on the part of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> group. The experiment causes unexplainable things to happen, causing {{all but one of the}} teenagers to flee. The remaining teen's mutilated body is discovered the next day, leading Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to investigate. Locals—including the faculty members—claim that the children have unleashed a demonic force with their rituals; a theory which is given validity by strange occurrences, such as frogs falling from the sky and water in the drinking fountain draining counter-clockwise, contrary to the Coriolis effect. Unknown to the agents, substitute teacher Mrs. Phyllis Paddock (Susan Blommaert) is behind the murder, keeping the eyes and heart of the victim in her desk. One of the faculty members, Jim Ausbury (Dan Butler) suspects one of his colleagues killed the boy, but the others believe it was an outside force. Ausbury's stepdaughter, Shannon (Heather McComb), suffers a breakdown during science class while dissecting a pig fetus, seeing its heart beat and its head move.|$|E
500|$|The {{other boys}} carry out equally barbaric acts: {{the two boys}} {{at the top of}} the steps are burning the eyes out of a bird with a hot needle heated by the link-boy's torch; <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{foreground}} are throwing at a cock (perhaps an allusion to a nationalistic enmity towards the French, and a suggestion that the action takes place on Shrove Tuesday, the traditional day for cock-shying); another boy ties a bone to a dog's tail—tempting, but out of reach; a pair of fighting cats are hung by their tails and taunted by a jeering group of boys; in the bottom left-hand corner a dog is set on a cat; and in the rear of the picture another cat tied to two [...] is thrown from a high window. In a foreshadowing of his ultimate fate, Tom Nero's name is written under the chalk drawing of a man hanging from the gallows; the meaning is made clear by the schoolboy artist pointing towards Tom. The absence of parish officers who should be controlling the boys is an intentional rebuke on Hogarth's part; he agreed with Henry Fielding that one of the causes for the rising crime rate was the lack of care from the overseers of the poor, who were too often interested in the posts only for the social status and monetary rewards they could bring.|$|E
