5|$|The red rubber system {{emerged with}} the {{creation}} of <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> regime in 1891 and lasted until 1906 when <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> system was restricted. At its height, it was heavily localised in the Équateur, Bandundu and Kasai regions.|$|E

5|$|After it {{was decided}} that {{passenger}} transport on the railway was to be terminated, both NSB's bus division and other private companies, particularly Sverre Hage, wanted to have <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> to operate the line. Both established a bus services with a frequency as if the other operator did not exist. At the peak of the conflict, NSB's operations were at one point stopped by the police, although in the end, <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> was granted to them. As a response, Haga applied for concession to operate passenger transport on the railway, but this was denied by the authorities. The transfer to bus operations increased the ticket prices and travel time.|$|E

5|$|Braathens SAFE {{applied for}} a {{concession}} on a route from Norway to New York on 27 March 1950. This would allow the airline to connect the route to the Hong Kong-flights, giving one continual service. The proposal would involve the purchase of Douglas DC-6B or Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation aircraft. The proposal {{was rejected by the}} government on 19 April. The following year, Braathens SAFE applied to extend the route to Tokyo, but this was also rejected by the government. In 1951, the company applied to purchase two Super Constellations to replace two sold DC-4s, which was granted, and on 14 January 1953 for an extension of <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> for another ten years. On 13 November 1953, the government rejected <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> application, stating that Norway was bound to grant <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> to SAS {{on the basis of the}} merger agreement.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>concession</b> conferred on the grantees {{the sole}} rights to mine {{throughout}} Lobengula's country, {{as well as}} the power to defend this exclusivity by force, in return for weapons and a regular monetary stipend. Starting in early 1889, the king repeatedly tried to disavow the document on the grounds of alleged deceit by the concessionaires regarding the settled terms; he insisted that restrictions on the grantees' activities had been agreed orally, and apparently considered these part of the contract even though the written text had been translated and repeatedly explained to him just before he signed it. He attempted to persuade the British government to deem <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> invalid, among other things sending emissaries to meet Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, but these efforts proved unsuccessful.|$|E
50|$|Between 1882 and 1884, the Qing Empire {{obtained}} concessions in Korea at Incheon, Busan and Wonsan. <b>The</b> <b>concessions</b> {{were occupied}} by Japan in 1894 after {{the outbreak of}} the First Sino-Japanese War. After China's defeat in that war, Korea (now with Japanese support) declared the unequal treaties with Qing China to be void, and unilaterally withdrew the extraterritoriality and other powers granted to China in respect of <b>the</b> <b>concessions.</b> <b>The</b> <b>concessions</b> were formally abolished in 1898.|$|R

5000|$|After the Opium War in 1842, various foreign {{concessions}} {{were established}} in Shanghai. The Old City remained under Chinese control, while <b>the</b> foreign <b>concessions</b> to its north and west quickly developed into the new urban areas of Shanghai. The Old City became known to the increasingly cosmopolitan populace as the [...] "Chinese City", or the [...] "Southern City" [...] to the local Chinese, whereas <b>the</b> <b>concessions</b> were called <b>the</b> [...] "Northern City" [...] (北市). Initially, only foreigners could settle in <b>the</b> <b>concessions</b> (though <b>the</b> <b>concessions</b> always had pre-existing Chinese residents), while newly arrived Chinese migrants lived in packed conditions in the Old City, which functioned {{as a sort of}} ghetto.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>concession</b> {{provided}} to Abir {{lay in the}} north of the country and was one of nine commercial concession areas established by Leopold in the Congo Free State. <b>The</b> <b>concession</b> was bounded to the north by the Congo River and the Société Anversoise concession, to the east by the Lomami River and the Lomami Company concession and to the west by the Lulonga Company concession which straddled the Lulonga River, into which the Maringa and Lopori flowed. To the south lay the Crown Domain (Domaine de la Couronne), the private property of Leopold, which comprised the best land in the Free State and was the richest in rubber.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans were}} sent from the {{ministry}} to the municipality, whose council passed the plans on 12 November 1908. Among the conditions were that within five years, the municipality could {{demand that the}} line be extended to either Ljabru or Ljan. <b>The</b> <b>concession</b> was again considered on 2 November 1911, {{and there it was}} decided that <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> would be removed if the line was not finished by the end of 1914. However, in November 1911, Oslo City Council postponed their permissions while the issue was again made subject to reports on the issue. The report suggested a different route, which ran via Lodalen and up Ekebergsletta at Ekeberg hovedgård. After negotiations, the city agreed to allow the line to follow Kongsveien.|$|E
5|$|This notice was {{published}} in the Bechuanaland News and Malmani Chronicle on 2 February 1889. A grand indaba of the izinDuna and the whites of Bulawayo was soon convened, but because Helm and Thompson were not present, the start of the investigation was delayed until 11 March. As in the negotiations with Rudd and Thompson in October, Lobengula did not himself attend, remaining close by but not interfering. The izinDuna questioned Helm and Thompson at great length, and various white men gave their opinions on <b>the</b> <b>concession.</b> A group of missionaries acted as mediators. Condemnation of <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> was led not by the izinDuna, but by the other whites, particularly Tainton.|$|E

50|$|The {{respective}} opposing {{parties in}} the Reichstag harshly criticized <b>the</b> <b>concessions</b> made by <b>the</b> Vatican and the Prussian government. Windthorst and the Centre Party were dismayed at being sidelined and not being consulted about <b>the</b> <b>concessions</b> <b>the</b> pope made, e. g. about the ban on Jesuits or the civil registry of clerics. None of the party’s major demands were met. Instead, the pope even sided with Bismarck on non-religious issues and pressured the Centre Party to support Bismarck or at least abstain, e. g. {{in the matter of}} the hotly debated Septennat 1887 (7-year military budget).Many Liberals, especially Falk, objected to <b>the</b> <b>concessions</b> Bismarck made to the Church.|$|R
5|$|When Viscount Mountmorres visited <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> in 1905 he {{reported}} abandoned villages across the territory and that villagers had {{fled to the}} deepest parts of the forest to avoid Abir's taxes. These villagers were living in makeshift leaf shelters and with few comforts. By March 1906 Richard Mohun, Abir's director, admitted that {{the situation in the}} area was out of control and suggested that the Congo Free State should assume control of <b>the</b> <b>concession.</b> By September of that year Abir was unable to contain the increasing number of rebellions and, facing falling profits, was forced to completely withdraw from the area and hand control of <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> back to the Free State. At this point there were still 47,000 rubber collectors listed on the company's books. The other two major rubber companies in the Congo, the Société Anversoise and the Lulonga Company, also had their concessions taken back into state control in 1906.|$|E
5|$|A new {{contract}} was signed on 19 July 2011 with Odebrecht; R$400million {{of the total}} would be financed by BNDES and the remaining R$420million would come from tax credits granted by the City. A 2007 law stated the tax credits {{could be used by}} any company that established itself in the Eastern region of the city, providing a credit of R$0.60 per R$1.00 invested. A new law was passed by the city legislature to deal specifically with this stadium and reduce the incentives, linking <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> of the credits to hosting the World Cup opening match and limiting the total amount of credits to R$420million. <b>The</b> <b>concession</b> was justified by the expectation that the stadium will generate R$950 million in city taxes during the six years after its opening. R$530 million in excess of the tax credits were given. The financing contract with BNDES was signed on 29 November 2013, under their ProCopas Arenas World Cup program. Caixa Econômica Federal is the distributing agent.|$|E
5|$|Abir {{enjoyed a}} boom {{through the late}} 1890s, by selling a {{kilogram}} of rubber in Europe for up to 10 fr which had cost them just 1.35 fr. However, this came {{at a cost to}} the human rights of those who could not pay the tax with imprisonment, flogging and other corporal punishment recorded. Abir's failure to suppress destructive harvesting methods and to maintain rubber plantations meant that the vines became increasingly scarce and by 1904 profits began to fall. During the early 1900s famine and disease spread across <b>the</b> <b>concession,</b> a natural disaster judged by some to have been exacerbated by Abir's operations, further hindering rubber collection. The 1900s also saw widespread rebellions against Abir's rule in <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> and attempts at mass migration to the French Congo or southwards. These events typically resulted in Abir dispatching an armed force to restore order.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> two <b>concession</b> {{contracts}} {{were for}} 25 years and included targets concerning coverage and service quality. One {{objective was to}} increase water coverage in Metro Manila to 96 percent by 2006, another to increase access to sewerage to 66 percent in West Manila, and 55 percent in East Manila {{by the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>concessions.</b> There were no contractual targets to increase efficiency; the companies' financial models used to set the tariffs in their bids assumed a rapid reduction of water losses and a reduction in staffing levels. <b>The</b> two <b>concession</b> holders were to inherit the debt of MWSS; the debt was not shared equally between <b>the</b> two <b>concessions.</b> Because <b>the</b> Western <b>concession</b> was considered more dense and more prosperous, 90 percent of the debt was assigned to it. <b>The</b> <b>concessions</b> were awarded through international competitive bidding, with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank Group advising the government on the design and bidding of <b>the</b> two <b>concession</b> contracts.|$|R

5|$|Abir's rubber {{gathering}} practices made it {{the most}} notorious of all <b>the</b> <b>concession</b> companies for human rights abuses in the Congo Free State. Abir was only involved with primary resource gathering and, despite being owned by European industrialists, operated in a style similar to warlords such as Tippu Tip. Abir was supported in its operations by the Free State which required the enormous profits generated to strengthen its control over the country during its formative years. <b>The</b> <b>concession</b> companies gave the Free State the time and revenue required to secure the Congo and to plan a long-term and more stable program of colonisation. Abir ultimately failed as its harvesting process valued high production over sustainability and it doomed to live out its own boom and bust cycle. Despite this the Abir production model {{was used by the}} French government as the basis for its concession system in the French Congo.|$|E
