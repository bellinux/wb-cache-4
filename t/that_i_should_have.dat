So it was a quick answer <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.|$|E

500|$|On February 26, 2010, the Ethics Committee {{issued its}} report. [...] It {{determined}} that Rangel had violated House gift rules, by accepting reimbursement for his {{travel to the}} conferences. [...] It found {{that he had not}} known of the contributions, but concluded that he was still responsible for them and was required to repay their cost. [...] Five other members were cleared of having violated rules, but were also required to repay their trips. [...] Rangel disagreed with the committee's finding, saying: Because they were my staff members who knew, one of whom has been discharged, [...] <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> known. Common sense dictates that members of Congress should not be held responsible for what could be the wrongdoing, or mistakes, or errors of staff.|$|E
500|$|Ian Smith showed {{sporting}} promise from {{an early}} age. After attending the Selukwe primary school, he boarded at Chaplin School in Gwelo, about [...] away. In his final year at Chaplin, he was head prefect, captain of the school teams in cricket, rugby and tennis, recipient of the Victor Ludorum in athletics, and the school's outstanding rifle marksman. [...] "I was an absolute lunatic about sport," [...] he later said; [...] "I concede, looking back, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> devoted much more time to my school work and less to sport." [...] All the same, his grades were good enough to win a place at Rhodes University College, in Grahamstown in South Africa, then often attended by Rhodesian students—partly because Rhodesia then had no university of its own, {{and partly because of}} the common eponymous association with Cecil Rhodes. Smith enrolled at the start of 1938, reading for a Bachelor of Commerce degree. After injuring his knee playing rugby, he took up rowing and became stroke for the university crew.|$|E
500|$|Androcles and the Lion (1912), a less heretical {{study of}} true and false {{religious}} attitudes than Blanco Posnet, ran {{for eight weeks}} in September and October 1913. It was followed by one of Shaw's most successful plays, Pygmalion, written in 1912 and staged in Vienna the following year, and in Berlin shortly afterwards. Shaw commented, [...] "It is the custom of the English press when a play of mine is produced, to inform the world {{that it is not}} a play—that it is dull, blasphemous, unpopular, and financially unsuccessful.... Hence arose an urgent demand on the part of the managers of Vienna and Berlin <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> my plays performed by them first." [...] The British production opened in April 1914, starring Sir Herbert Tree and Mrs Patrick Campbell as, respectively, a professor of phonetics and a cockney flower-girl. There had earlier been a romantic liaison between Shaw and Campbell that caused Charlotte Shaw considerable concern, but by the time of the London premiere it had ended. The play attracted capacity audiences until July, when Tree insisted on going on holiday, and the production closed. His co-star then toured with the piece in the US.|$|E

500|$|Outside the Pacific Northwest, {{a number}} of artists and music scenes {{influenced}} grunge. Noise rock bands such as Scratch Acid and the Butthole Surfers influenced Nirvana. Alternative rock bands from the Northeastern United States, including Sonic Youth, Pixies, Pavement, and Dinosaur Jr., are important influences on the genre. Through their patronage of Seattle bands, Sonic Youth [...] "inadvertently nurtured" [...] the grunge scene, and reinforced the fiercely independent attitudes of its musicians. The influence of Pixies on Nirvana was noted by Kurt Cobain, who commented in a Rolling Stone interview, [...] "I connected with that band so heavily <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been in that band—or at least a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard." [...] In August 1997, {{in an interview with}} Guitar World, Dave Grohl said: [...] "From Kurt, Krist [...] and I liking the Knack, Bay City Rollers, Beatles and Abba just as much as we liked Flipper and Black Flag...You listen to any Pixies record and it's all over there. Or even Black Sabbath's [...] "War Pigs"-it's there: the power of the dynamic. We just sort of abused it with pop songs and got sick with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis {{was once}} again optioned to Triple-A after {{starting}} 2010 batting [...]188 in 15 games (48 at bats). He was recalled on July 9 to play first base for the Rangers. [...] A roster spot, {{as well as a}} position in the Rangers starting lineup, became available when Justin Smoak was involved in a trade with the Seattle Mariners for Cliff Lee. On July 29, he was sent back to the RedHawks to make room for Mitch Moreland. In 103 games (398 at bats) with the RedHawks, he had 130 hits, 31 doubles, 14 home runs, and 80 RBI. He finished second in the league in hitting (.327, behind John Lindsey's [...]353) and fifth in strikeouts (105). He was recalled for the final time on September 11 but this time was used as a backup corner infielder and pinch-hitter, as Moreland was playing first base. In 45 games (120 at bats) with Texas, Davis hit [...]192 with 23 hits, one home run, and four RBI. He was left off the postseason roster as the Rangers entered the World Series {{for the first time ever}} but ended up losing in five games to the San Francisco Giants. Attempting to aid Davis's offense, the Rangers tried to get Davis to widen his batting stance. However, playing in the Dominican Winter League over the offseason, Davis [...] "felt like I fouled a lot of pitches off <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> driven." [...] He stood more upright and kept his feet closer together and, in 2013, said that this was a defining moment in his career.|$|E
500|$|In turn, Williams {{wrote that}} if Boden had left {{instructions}} {{that the man}} elected {{should be the one}} [...] "most likely to secure a world-wide reputation for the Sanskrit Chair, I confess <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> hesitated to prosecute my design." [...] However, {{this was not the case}} and it would be [...] "unjustifiable" [...] in terms of the statutes governing the chair if the professor were to lecture on wider topics. In his view, the Vedic literature was [...] "of less importance" [...] and the philosophical literature was [...] "very mystical and abstruse", whereas [...] "the classical or modern" [...] period (the laws, two heroic poems, and the plays) was the [...] "most important". Reminding his readers that he had edited two Sanskrit plays, he stated that the literature of the third period constituted the Sanskrit scriptures, not ("as has hitherto been believed") the Veda, [...] "still less the Rig Veda". He commented that Müller's edition of the Rig Veda was requiring [...] "an expenditure of time, labour, money, and erudition far greater than was ever bestowed on any edition of the Holy Bible", adding that Boden did not intend to [...] "aid in the missionary work by perpetuating and diffusing the obsolescent Vedic Scriptures." [...] He claimed that his own approach to Sanskrit scholarship, with his dictionaries and grammar books, was [...] "suited to English minds", unlike Müller's [...] "continental" [...] and [...] "philosophical" [...] approach, which dealt with texts no longer relevant to modern Hindus that missionaries would not benefit from studying.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{letter to}} Thomas Cromwell, {{which can be}} dated to between September 1529 and Whitsuntide 1530, written by Margaret Vernon {{provides}} further proof of Gregory's young age.

2500|$|Blake {{often said}} that he was joined by {{invisible}} sitters as he drew them, including, he claimed, a number of angels, Voltaire, Moses and the Flea, who told him that [...] "fleas were inhabited by the souls of such men as were by nature blood thirsty to excess." [...] In his obituary, it was stated that, [...] "The flea communicated to Mr. Blake what passed, as related to himself, at the Creation. 'It was first intended,' said he (the flea) 'to make me as big as a bullock; but then when it was considered from my construction, so armed—and so powerful withal, that in proportion to my bulk, (mischievous as I now am) <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been a too mighty destroyer; it was determined to make me—no bigger than I am." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lim's career-defining lead {{performance}} as Harry Lee in Perth (2004) was praised by TODAYs Ross Wallace, who wrote, [...] "If {{there were any}} doubts that Lim Kay Tong is Singapore's finest actor, 2004's Perth should have laid them to rest... towering performance". Comparing his acting to Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, TODAY also ranked his role {{as one of the}} best [...] "male performances of the year in any genre, any country", asking, [...] "Has there ever been a Singaporean performance that surpassed Lim's deranged taxi driver?" [...] Neil Humphreys called Lim's [...] "world-class performance" [...] in Perth [...] "almost without parallel", writing, [...] "This is not a portrayal; it's a metamorphosis". Reflecting on his role, Lim said [...] "it was about time. [...] wasn't commercially successful, but the role was meaningful...I'm still adamant <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> underplayed certain parts of Harry, but I'm sure [...] Djinn won't back down from his direction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morricone finally {{received}} a second Oscar nomination for The Mission. Morricone's original score lost out to Herbie Hancock's coolly arranged jazz on Bertrand Tavernier's Round Midnight. It was {{considered as a}} surprising win and a controversial one, given {{that much of the}} music in the film was pre-existing. Morricone stated the following during a 2001 interview with The Guardian: [...] "I definitely felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> won for The Mission. Especially when you consider that the Oscar-winner that year was Round Midnight, which was not an original score. It had a very good arrangement by Herbie Hancock, but it used existing pieces. So there could be no comparison with The Mission. There was a theft!" [...] His score for The Mission was ranked at number 1 in a poll of the all-time greatest film scores. The top 10 list was compiled by 40 film composers such as Michael Giacchino and Carter Burwell. The score is ranked 23rd on the AFI's list of 25 greatest film scores of all time.|$|E
