Malaysia Airlines announced that Flight 370 was assumed lost with no survivors.

5|$|Two villages {{situated}} on the southern boundary were shifted to the Firozpur–Manpur area {{situated on}} Ramnagar–Kashipur highway during 1990–93; the vacated areas were designated as buffer zones. <b>The</b> <b>families</b> <b>in</b> these villages were mostly dependent on forest products. With the passage of time, these areas began {{to show signs of}} ecological recovery. Vines, herbs, grasses and small trees began to appear, followed by herbaceous flora, eventually leading to natural forest type. It was observed that grass began to grow on the vacated agricultural fields and the adjoining forest areas started recuperating. By 1999–2002 several plant species emerged in these buffer zones. The newly arisen lush green fields attracted grass eating animals, mainly deer and elephants, who slowly migrated towards these areas and even preferred to stay there throughout the monsoon.|$|E
5|$|Winton {{organised}} {{the transfer}} of the children from the Nazi-appointed Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to homes in Britain, in the process arranging the necessary bonds and permits for their departure, and finding <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>in</b> Britain who would receive the children. Winton and a team identified those children most at risk from the thousands of refugees driven south following the Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland. For each child to be accepted, British officials required a confirmed foster home and a £50 guarantee. Winton returned to Great Britain in March to arrange the reception of the children, but his task was hampered {{by the fact that the}} domestic evacuation of children was already occurring, and places were hard to find.|$|E

500|$|A {{month after}} the disappearance, Malaysia Airlines' chief {{executive}} Ahmad Jauhari Yahya acknowledged that ticket sales had declined but failed to provide specific details. This may have partially resulted from the suspension of the airline's advertising campaigns following the disappearance. Ahmad stated {{in an interview with}} the Wall Street Journal that the airline's [...] "primary focus...is that we do take care of <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>in</b> terms of their emotional needs and also their financial needs. It is important that we provide answers for them. It is important that the world has answers, as well." [...] In further remarks, Ahmad said he was not sure when the airline could start repairing its image, but that the airline was adequately insured to cover the financial loss stemming from Flight 370's disappearance. In China, where the majority of passengers were from, bookings on Malaysia Airlines were down 60 percent in March.|$|E

2500|$|According to Tadeusz Manteuffel and Andrew Gorecki the Clan {{consisted}} of people {{related by blood}} and descending from a common ancestor in early medieval time. Before the time of Mieszko I of Poland that united different tribes, the tribes were ruled by the Clan. During the time of Bolesław I Chrobry (967 – 17 June 1025) and Bolesław III Wrymouth clans included free mercenaries from different part of Europe but specially from Normandy to defend their properties and country.

2500|$|The Democrats {{said that}} would fatten the rich; the tariff should be low—for [...] "revenue only" [...] (thus not to foster manufacturing). Whigs argued that banks and paper money were needed; the Democrats countered that no honest man wants them. Public works {{programs}} to build roads, canals and railroads would give the country the infrastructure it needed for rapid economic development, said the Whigs. Democrats replied {{they did not want}} that kind of complex change. Rather the Democrats called for more of the same—especially more farms to raise <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>in</b> the traditional style. More land is needed for that, Democrats said, so they pushed for expansion south and west. Jackson conquered Florida for the US. Over intense Whig opposition, his political heir, James Polk (1844–48) added Texas, the Southwest, California, and Oregon. Next on the Democratic agenda would be Cuba.|$|E

2500|$|The new {{assignment}} {{policy which}} was {{adopted in the}} fall of 2002 was known as the “School Choice Plan.” This new choice plan divided the city into four large attendance zones based on neighborhoods.

If families chose their home school as their first choice, they were guaranteed that school; otherwise they were entered into a lottery that gave available spaces in overenrolled schools. If [...] people did not choose a school, they were immediately placed into their home school.

2500|$|Citizens in Trinidad and Tobago {{were the}} first to observe IMD on 19 November 1999. The event was {{conceived}} and coordinated by Jerome Teelucksingh from The University of the West Indies at <b>the</b> <b>Families</b> <b>in</b> Action headquarters in Newtown, Port of Spain. As his rationale for creating the event Teelucksingh stated, [...] "I realized there was no day for men... some have said that there is Father's Day, but what about young boys, teenagers and men who are not fathers?" [...] Teelucksingh, understanding the importance of celebrating good male role models, felt that his own father had been an example of an excellent role model and so chose 19 November partly because this was his father's birthday, and also because it was the date on which a local sporting team in his country created a level of unity with transcended gender, religious and ethnic divisions. The idea of celebrating an International Men's Day received written support from officials in UNESCO and the event has continued to be celebrated annually in Trinidad and Tobago and other countries since its beginning.|$|E
2500|$|The Baker-Fancher party {{consisted}} of several smaller parties that set out {{separately from the}} Ozarks in northwestern Arkansas, and then joined up along the way.

Other groups included the Huff train, which also left from Benton, the Mitchell, Dunlapp, and Prewitt trains which left from Marion County, and the Poteet–Tackitt–Jones, Cameron, and Miller trains which left from Johnson County. Pleasant Tackitt, from the Poteet–Tackitt–Jones train, was a Methodist [...] minister who led the others in worship and prayer services while on their journey. When the groups left Arkansas in April 1857, the total company numbered more than 200. However, during the journey, some groups split off and others joined.
