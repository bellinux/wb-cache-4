It is true that there was no attestation clause: but the supposed necessity for an attestation clause is one of those fallacies of the lay mind which, perhaps, cluster more frequently and with a greater persistence round questions connected with <b>testamentary</b> <b>disposition</b> than those of any other branch of the law. Therefore, we must take the will to have been properly executed in accordance with the spirit of the statute.|$|E
40|$|THE 17 TH CENTURY ROMANIAN TESTAMENTARY MACRO-SPEECH-ACT IN THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT. STEREOTYPY AND INNOVATION. In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} the 17 th century Romanian <b>testamentary</b> <b>dispositions,</b> {{advancing}} the idea that the testaments could be interpreted as a composite speech act. We will investigate this kind of documents not only from the structural and lexical point of view, but also in a pragmatic and rhetoric perspective. In the analysis of <b>testamentary</b> <b>dispositions</b> various communicative phenomena are at stake, such as the structure of the documents, produced by a testator within a certain cultural- historical framework, with certain intentions, using certain textual instruments. The 17 th century Romanian <b>testamentary</b> <b>dispositions</b> follow ancient patterns, and have a standard structure. Compare to the western testaments, the Romanian <b>testamentary</b> <b>dispositions</b> restrain themselves to essential requirements just on a need to know basis. Towards mid 17 th century they increasingly became a space in which the testators express their feelings, opinions and perceptions. We will investigate several formulae that aim to avoid any violation of a testament (the so- called clauses of warning comprising threats of anathema or malediction...|$|R

And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.|$|E
