5|$|In Queens, New York, police chase a sedan driven {{through a}} parking garage by two men keeping a <b>teenage</b> <b>boy</b> named Tyler Carson (Cameron Monaghan) in the backseat.

The kidnappers' crime spree continues on the road. One of them, Hickey (John Tench), demands that a convenience store clerk hand over all his cash. Another customer tries to intervene, but then takes a pot of hot coffee, pours the coffee over his own head, and beats himself with the pot. The cashier then electrocutes himself.|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{transition from}} boyhood to manhood {{is one of}} the most important male life transitions. <b>Teenage</b> <b>boys</b> at risk of school exclusion, and thus social exclusion, face added difficulties when school participation becomes dysfunctional. Men 2 ̆ 7 s Sheds are community-based male-friendly places where men can connect with other members of their communities, while simultaneously providing opportunities to learn practical skills and develop new interests. Many Australian Men 2 ̆ 7 s Sheds are offering intergenerational mentoring programs, usually based on shared construction projects, specifically targeted at <b>teenage</b> <b>boys</b> who are considered at risk. This paper presents descriptive qualitative data about one such intergenerational mentoring program. Data were collected from interviews with 4 <b>teenage</b> <b>boys,</b> a school Transition Advisor, and written teacher evaluations. Descriptive findings suggest that such programs offer some <b>teenage</b> <b>boys</b> a positive space to learn, socialise, promote tangible notions of community service, and reinforce respectful relationships in the supportive presence of older men...|$|R

5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei, players {{take the}} role of an unnamed protagonist, a <b>teenage</b> <b>boy</b> who can {{communicate}} with demons using a computer program. The gameplay {{is similar to that of}} other games in the series: players make their way through dungeons and fight against demons in a first-person perspective. The protagonist uses a variety of weapons and items, with the primary weapons being swords and guns. Such items are bought from merchants scattered around the world map. In special areas, the protagonist can use the in-game currency to restore health and magic points for themselves and their demons, remove status ailments, and revive fallen demons. Special Terminals scattered across the world map allow the player to save their game, and they can use them to teleport between terminals in different areas of Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|The song's music video, {{directed}} by Nick Brandt, and shot in Los Angeles, is focused around six unrelated {{people living in}} isolation in a cityscape on a dark, cloudy day {{while the rest of}} the world moves around them in slow motion. The first half of the video introduces these figures. Five of the figures are: a bald man looking down at the city from his apartment window, a middle-aged woman sitting alone in a coffee shop, a homeless man lying on the damp street, a well-dressed figure feeding pigeons, and a <b>teenage</b> <b>boy</b> ostracized from a game of baseball. The sixth figure is Jackson himself, seen walking the city streets while he sings. Special effects are used to show birds and wasps flying, glass breaking and coffee spilling, all in slow motion.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} occupations could be chosen or {{inherited}} from a father's line of work. This would include – {{but was not}} limited to – coffinmakers, ironworkers and blacksmiths, tailors, cooks and noodle-makers, retail merchants, tavern, teahouse, or winehouse managers, shoemakers, seal cutters, pawnshop owners, brothel heads, and merchant bankers engaging in a proto-banking system involving notes of exchange. Virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had. Male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a <b>teenage</b> <b>boy</b> was seen as a mark of elite status, regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms. Public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods. Urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices, specialized luxury goods, headgear, fine cloth, teas, and others. Smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers. A small township also provided a place for simple schooling, news and gossip, matchmaking, religious festivals, traveling theater groups, tax collection, and bases of famine relief distribution.|$|E

5|$|After several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to}} destroy the Horcrux, the trio take turns wearing it to dilute its power. Harry sees a vision of Voldemort interrogating and killing the wand-maker Gregorovitch, who claims that a <b>teenage</b> <b>boy</b> had once stolen the legendary Elder Wand from his shop. While Ron is wearing the locket, he is overcome by negative feelings and argues with Harry before leaving him and Hermione behind. Hermione deduces that the sword of Gryffindor can destroy Horcruxes and decides with Harry to go to Godric's Hollow. They visit Harry's parents' graves and the house where they were killed. They encounter Bathilda Bagshot, who they believe may have the sword. Bathilda lets Harry and Hermione into her house, and is revealed to actually be Nagini, controlling Bathilda's reanimated corpse from inside of her. Hermione and Harry escape into the Forest of Dean, but Hermione accidentally breaks Harry's wand whilst fighting Nagini. Hermione is then {{able to identify the}} mysterious thief seen in Harry's vision as Gellert Grindelwald.|$|E

It is revealed {{that he is a}} paedophile who has been grooming and sexually abusing Whitney, Bianca's adopted daughter, since she was 12. He immediately resumes his sexual relationship with Whitney, despite his displeasure at her more adult appearance, insisting she remove her make-up and jewellery. When Whitney gets a role in the school play, Romeo and Julie, Tony is angry about having less time with her, becoming jealous of her co-star Peter Beale (Thomas Law). Tony deceives Whitney into believing they will run away and start a new life together when she turns sixteen. Whitney gives him money she has been keeping for his return, which he gives Bianca as a deposit for a flat. Tony assaults Peter {{as a result of his}} growing jealousy, and is nearly reported to the police by Peter's sister Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield). Whitney convinces Lucy not to go to the police, but not before Lucy tells Bianca what happened. When Bianca angrily tells Tony that she is not a child anymore, he realizes he is no longer attracted to her.|$|E
