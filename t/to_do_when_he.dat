5|$|Richardson {{left the}} art school in 1920, and {{considered}} how else {{he might make}} a career. He briefly thought of pharmacy and then of journalism, abandoning each when he learned how much study the former required and how difficult mastering shorthand for the latter would be. He was still unsure what <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> saw Sir Frank Benson as Hamlet in a touring production. He was thrilled, and felt at once that he must become an actor.|$|E
5|$|Demands for Hitler to {{constrain}} the SA strengthened. Conservatives in the army, industry, and politics placed Hitler under increasing pressure {{to reduce the}} influence of the SA and to move against Röhm. While Röhm's homosexuality did not endear him to conservatives, they were more concerned about his political ambitions. Hitler for his part remained indecisive and uncertain about just what precisely he wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> left for Venice to meet Benito Mussolini on June 15. Before Hitler left, and at the request of Presidential State Secretary Otto Meißner, Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath ordered the German Ambassador to Italy Ulrich von Hassell— without Hitler's knowledge— to ask Mussolini to tell Hitler that the SA was blackening Germany's good name. Neurath's manoeuvre to put pressure on Hitler paid off, with Mussolini agreeing to the request (Neurath was a former ambassador to Italy, and knew Mussolini well). During the summit in Venice, Mussolini upbraided Hitler for tolerating the violence, hooliganism, and homosexuality of the SA, which Mussolini stated were ruining Hitler's good reputation all over the world. Mussolini used the affair occasioned by the murder of Giacomo Matteotti {{as an example of the}} kind of trouble unruly followers could cause a dictator. While Mussolini's criticism did not win Hitler over to acting against the SA, it helped push him in that direction.|$|E
500|$|... "Lemme See" [...] is a mid-tempo R {{song that}} heavily {{incorporates}} synthesizers, {{and has a}} running duration of four minutes and 15 seconds. It contains elements of hip hop music, and its production was compared {{to the one in}} Kelly Rowland's [...] "Motivation" [...] (2011). Lyrically, Usher is contemplating on what he is going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> [...] "gets a certain female clubgoer into his bedroom", in the line: Hey girl, I’m debating if I should take you home. During the pre-chorus, he comes to the conclusion: I decided to take my shirt off / and show my chest.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Appel, who wanted to do an episode that had two things; a [...] "go to work with your parents day" [...] and Bart getting a driver's license. The [...] "go to work with your parents day" [...] idea appealed to Appel because it was {{something}} he [...] "lost the right" [...] <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> went from public school to private school as a child. Appel considered those days to be his favorites because he [...] "didn't have to do anything" [...] at his parents' job. The idea of having a driver's license was something that Appel dreamed about when he was younger.|$|E
500|$|... "Lemme See" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Usher, released through RCA Records, as the third single from his seventh studio album Looking 4 Myself (2012). The track features vocals from rapper Rick Ross. It was written by Usher, Eric Bellinger, Jim Jonsin, Danny Morris, Nickolas Marzouca and Lundon Knighten with its production helmed by Jonsin and Morris. It was digitally released on May 4, 2012 and sent to urban radio on May 8, 2012. [...] "Lemme See" [...] is a mid-tempo R song that makes heavy use of synthesizers. Its lyrics depict Usher contemplating on what he is going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> [...] "gets a certain female clubgoer into his bedroom".|$|E
500|$|The series {{revolves}} around Dexter (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh in seasons 1–2; Candi Milo in seasons 3–4), a bespectacled boy-genius who possesses a secret laboratory {{hidden behind a}} bookcase in his bedroom. The laboratory is filled with Dexter's inventions and can be accessed by speaking various passwords or by activating hidden switches on Dexter's bookshelf (e.g. pulling out a specific book). Though highly intelligent, Dexter often fails at what he has set out <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> becomes overexcited and makes careless choices. Although {{he comes from a}} typical all-American family, Dexter speaks with a thick accent of indeterminate origin. Christine Cavanaugh described it as [...] "an affectation, some kind of accent, we're not quite sure. A small Peter Lorre, but not. Perhaps he's Latino, perhaps he's French. He's a scientist; he knows he needs some kind of accent." [...] Genndy Tartakovsky explained, [...] "He considers himself a very serious scientist, and all well-known scientists have accents." ...|$|E
50|$|Her book The Sex-Starved Wife: What <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>When</b> <b>He's</b> Lost Desire was {{released}} in 2008. The book was undertaken after Weiner-Davis was inundated with telephone calls and letters from many women {{who said they were}} having this issue within their marriage and were seeking information to resolve the issue with their husbands. To help determine the extent of the issue Weiner-Davis did a study with the help of Redbook which showed that two-thirds of the women who responded said they desired sex at least as much or more as their husbands did.|$|R

500|$|Lionel Luthor {{is portrayed}} in the program by John Glover; Glover said he appreciates the [...] "clear canvas" [...] {{he had to work}} with when {{developing}} his portrayal of Lionel. In season one, Glover traveled from New York to Vancouver every week while filming his scenes because he was already committed to stage appearances in New York at the time. When portraying the character's struggle with terminal liver disease, Glover was inspired by a friend's battle with cancer; he said his friend was a [...] "cheerleader to people", who supported and boosted others when they were feeling bad. When Glover's friend learned he had cancer he fought hard to get over it, but when he learned that it was terminal he went to bed and stopped eating until he died about ten days later. This helped Glover understand how someone powerful and full of life could commit suicide—which Lionel prepares <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> learns his illness is terminal.|$|E
500|$|Many {{songs from}} Memory Almost Full {{were from a}} group of songs, which also {{included}} songs from Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, and some intended for the former nearly ended up on the latter. Any songs that were started, but not finished, for Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, McCartney didn't want to re-do for Memory Almost Full. As sessions for the album progressed McCartney wrote some more songs, something that McCartney used <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was in the Beatles. A song called [...] "Perfect Lover" [...] was recorded at either one of the three following studios: RAK Studios, AIR Studios or Ocean Way Studios; sometime between November 2003 and April 2005. [...] "Perfect Lover", in its original form was more folk-like, similar to Chaos and Creation in the Backyards [...] "Friends to Go". [...] "Perfect Lover" [...] went through a minor lyrical change, the bridge was changed, and an overhaul of its musical arrangement, before it finally became [...] "Ever Present Past". Two years after the 2003 session, sessions for the album started again. The book Paul McCartney: Recording Sessions (1969-2013). A Journey Through Paul McCartney's Songs After The Beatles reports that the recordings of the album were started in September–October 2003 and resumed in February 2004 at Abbey Road, with other sessions taking place between March 2006 and February 2007.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 6, 1910. It states: [...] "Mr. Jenks {{and his family are}} spending the summer in a fashionable summer hotel, and Mr. Jenks is kept bored and busy performing the many services demanded by his wife. He hits upon the bright idea of sending himself a business telegram which would necessitate his immediate presence in the city, then starts out on a little vacation on his own account. Walking on the beach he discovers a secluded spot, and leaving his clothes on the beach he takes a swim. In the meantime, a convict, who has escaped from a nearby penitentiary, has entered a house nearby in search of a change of clothes, his stripes being too conspicuous. The convict locks a woman of the house up and ransacks the house, but the only garments he can find are women's clothes, and, deciding that they are better than stripes, he dons them. As the convict in his new disguise is walking along the beach he sees Jenks' clothes lying there and promptly makes another change. There is nothing for Jenks <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> comes out except to array himself as a woman. On {{his way back to the}} hotel he passes the house that has been robbed and is unlucky enough to hear the woman's cry for help. When she gets out of the closet, through his aid, she naturally believes that he is the convict, and screams for help. Jenks, frightened, runs away, but is captured after a chase in which the entire village takes part. His wife and daughter witness humiliation, and it's almost impossible for them to 'square things.'" ...|$|E
