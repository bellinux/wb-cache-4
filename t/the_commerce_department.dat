In 2012 he and his Massachusetts peers successfully pushed <b>the</b> <b>Commerce</b> <b>Department</b> to issue a federal disaster declaration for fisheries in the northeastern U.S., which would open up the opportunity for financial aid. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, he proposed to redirect $111 million of relief funding to fisheries throughout the country, although the proposal was not adopted by the House Rules Committee.|$|E

According to figures from <b>the</b> <b>Commerce</b> <b>Department,</b> up to 25% {{of fruits and vegetables}} rot before being sold, compared to around 5% in a typical developed country. As intermediaries cannot sell these rotten fruits they pay farmers less than they would if able to sell all or most of the fruits and vegetables. This reduces farmer’s revenues although the problem is caused by post-production inefficiencies, which they are not themselves aware of during price negotiations with intermediaries.|$|E

In 1905, Bosung College was established under Yi Yong-ik, Chief of the Imperial Treasury: <b>the</b> <b>Commerce</b> <b>Department</b> and the Law Department were the first two departments of the college. The Soongsil Academy, started at Pyongyang in 1897, had opened a college section in 1905 and was authorized as the Soongsil University by the Korean government in 1907.

25|$|Public {{opinion in}} the United States heavily criticized {{the sinking of the}} San Juan, as did many newspapers.

The argument carried forward by the general public stated the San Juan, being 47 years old and poorly maintained by a cut rate carrier, should have not been allowed to continue sailing. The Steamboat Inspection Service, an entity of <b>the</b> <b>Commerce</b> <b>Department</b> which enforced American civil maritime regulations at the time of San Juans sinking, was known for widespread corruption and being widely disorganized. A supervisor in steamship inspection, John K. Bulger (who coincidentally had been involved in the Columbia investigations) claimed that it did not matter what condition San Juan was in prior to the disaster, as the collision would have sunk the ship regardless. Despite Bulger's statement, the speed in which San Juan sank was more of a concern rather than whether the ship could survive the collision or not.|$|E
