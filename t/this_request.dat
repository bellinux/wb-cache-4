5|$|In 1852, he was {{commissioned}} by the Ottoman authorities {{to prevent the spread}} of a Druze rebellion from Hauran to northern Palestine. He successfully satisfied <b>this</b> <b>request,</b> aided by his Bedouin allies. Among his assignments during the rebellion was the protection from Bedouin raiders of a supply route which the Ottomans used to send ammunition to their troops in Hauran. Aqil and his men accomplished the task successfully.|$|E
5|$|Kean saw the North Korean {{breakthrough}} at Haman as {{a serious}} threat to his division's line. At dawn on September 1, Kean requested permission from Walker to commit the entire 27th Infantry Regiment, just arrived at Masan the previous evening and still held in Eighth Army reserve. Walker denied <b>this</b> <b>request,</b> but did release one battalion of the regiment to Kean's control.|$|E
5|$|After Busch {{had spent}} six months with his uncle Kleine at Lüthorst, he {{expressed}} an aim to continue study in Munich. <b>This</b> <b>request</b> caused a rift with his father who, however, eventually funded this move; - see for comparison Busch's illustrated story of Painter Klecksel. Busch's expectations of the Munich Academy of Fine Arts were not met. His life became aimless; there were occasional return visits to Lüthorst, but contact with his parents had been broken off. In 1857 and 1858, as his position seemed to be without prospects, he contemplated emigration to Brazil to keep bees.|$|E

5|$|After {{the cathedral}} in Gamla Uppsala was damaged by fire in 1204, the Chapter sought {{permission}} from the Holy See to move the building to a larger site. Pope Alexander IV granted <b>this</b> <b>request</b> in 1258 on condition that the name of Uppsala be maintained. At a meeting in Söderköping in September 1270, Archbishop Fulco Angelus and the cathedral chapter decided the site should be in Östra Aros. Formal authorization of the move was issued in 1271 by Bishop Carolus of Västerås whom the Pope had appointed to oversee the case.|$|E
5|$|Amado Boudou, {{who served}} as {{minister}} of economy during Kirchner's first term and vice president during the second, was suspected of corruption in 2012 case. The Ciccone Calcografica printing company filed for bankruptcy in 2010, but <b>this</b> <b>request</b> was cancelled when businessman Alejandro Vandenbroele bought it. The company received tax breaks to pay its debts, and was selected to print banknotes of the Argentine peso. It is suspected that Vandenbroele is actually a frontman for Boudou, and that he employed his clout as minister of economy to benefit a company that actually belonged to him.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold then {{applied to}} {{accompany}} General Carleton, {{who was going}} to New York to replace Clinton as commander-in-chief; <b>this</b> <b>request</b> went nowhere. Other attempts all failed to gain positions within the government or the British East India Company {{over the next few years}} and he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non-wartime service. His reputation also came under criticism in the British press, especially when compared to that of Major André, who was celebrated for his patriotism.|$|E

5|$|Dato Mogol died in 1620 and was {{succeeded by}} his eldest son, Sulaiman. A period of turmoil erupted {{ten years later}} when the Queen of Pattani branded the new ruler of Siam, King Prasat Thong, a usurper and tyrant. The queen {{withheld}} tribute and ordered attacks on Ligor (present-day Nakhon Si Thammarat) and Bordelongh (present-day Phatthalung); Ayuthaya responded by blockading Pattani with an army of 60,000 men, as well as enlisting {{the help of the}} Dutch people in capturing the City. Singora became involved in the dispute and in 1633 sent an envoy to Ayuthaya requesting help. The outcome of <b>this</b> <b>request</b> is not known, but Dutch records show that Singora was severely damaged and the pepper crop destroyed.|$|E
5|$|During his labors {{to sustain}} the {{provisional}} government, Johnson's lack of hearing from his family weighed heavily upon him. The only family member {{with whom he had}} contact was his son Madison ("Matty"), who had joined John Hunt Morgan's cavalry. Johnson admired and respected Morgan, and was pleased that his son had chosen to serve under him. In 1862, he requested by letter that his wife send their fifteen-year-old son Junius to serve in the Confederate Army. Despite Johnson's protestations that he would ensure his son's safety, his wife refused <b>this</b> <b>request.</b>|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with this}} evidence, the General Board sent a formal request in October 1903 to C, asking it {{to draw up}} plans for a {{battleship}} including these characteristics. No progress {{had been made by}} 26 January 1904, when the General Board asked C for a design including four 12-inch guns, eight 10-inch or larger guns, and no intermediate armament beyond 3-inch anti-destroyer guns. The move to only 10-inch weaponry was the result of doubt among naval authorities that heavier guns could physically be mounted on a ship's broadside. No action was taken on <b>this</b> <b>request</b> until September, when C began planning a ship with four 12-inch guns in dual turrets along with eight dual 10-inch or four single 12-inch guns.|$|E

5|$|On 12 July Ward {{reported}} on the weekend's events to MI5. He told Woods that Ivanov and Profumo had met and that the latter had shown considerable interest in Keeler. Ward also stated {{that he had been}} asked by Ivanov for information about the future arming of West Germany with atomic weapons. <b>This</b> <b>request</b> for military information did not greatly disturb MI5, who expected a GRU officer to ask such questions. Profumo's interest in Keeler was an unwelcome complication in their plans to use her in a honey trap operation against Ivanov, to help secure his defection. Woods therefore referred the issue to MI5's director-general, Sir Roger Hollis.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August 1941, {{while he}} was {{concluding}} arrangements with the Germans, Pećanac {{received a letter from}} rival Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović proposing an arrangement where Pećanac would control the Chetniks south of the Western Morava River while Mihailović would control the Chetniks in all other areas. Pećanac declined <b>this</b> <b>request</b> and suggested that he might offer Mihailović the position as his chief of staff. He also recommended that Mihailović's detachments disband and join his organisation. In the meantime, Pećanac had arranged for the transfer of several thousand of his Chetniks to the Serbian Gendarmerie to act as German auxiliaries.|$|E
5|$|On February 2, 1425, Bartolomeo Valori and Cosimo de' Medici {{requested}} 400 of the 800florins {{that had}} been deposited with the Calimala, likely for work already completed. This deposit was insurance in case the executors left the tomb unfinished and the Calimala was forced to pay for its completion, {{as it had been}} obliged to with the finger reliquary. <b>This</b> <b>request</b> is also the most direct piece of evidence for Cosimo's involvement with the commissioning. Despite this document, Vasari's claim in his Vite of 1550 that Cosimo was responsible for the handling of the commission has been questioned.|$|E

Carymaunee asked the Americans not to put irons on Red Bird and Wekau; <b>this</b> <b>request</b> was granted.

The next week, the assembly officially requested {{the assistance of the}} Union and asked the governor to call out the state militia to join the Federal forces. Magoffin also vetoed <b>this</b> <b>request.</b> Again the assembly overrode his veto and Magoffin acquiesced.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Harith's death, Ghassanid {{territory}} {{was attacked}} by Qabus ibn al-Mundhir, the new Lakhmid ruler, who sought {{to take advantage of}} the situation. Qabus's forces were repulsed and Mundhir invaded Lakhmid territory in turn, seizing much plunder. As he turned back, the Lakhmids again confronted the Ghassanid army, but suffered a heavy defeat. After this success, Mundhir wrote to the Byzantine emperor Justin II (r. 565–578) asking for gold for his men. <b>This</b> <b>request</b> reportedly angered Justin, who sent instructions to his local commander to lure the Ghassanid ruler into a trap and have him killed. But the letter fell into Mundhir's hands, who then severed his relations with the Empire and refused to commit his forces during the war with Persia that began in 572.|$|E

5|$|The Delmar Bypass {{was opened}} in December 1963, {{connecting}} Elm Avenue {{in the west}} to U.S. Route9W in the east. The state did not add traffic lights to any of the four intersections on the bypass as a late 1963 study indicated that the signals were unnecessary. In mid-January 1964, the Bethlehem Town Board pushed the state to add traffic lights to every intersection in the wake of several accidents and near-misses at the crossings. <b>This</b> <b>request</b> was eventually granted. The Delmar Bypass did not have a signed route number until the 1970s when NY32 was realigned to follow the highway. As a result, NY335 no longer connected to a signed route at its south end.|$|E
