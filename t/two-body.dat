5|$|With the {{publication}} of his Principia roughly eighty years later (1687), Isaac Newton provided a physical theory that accounted for all three of Kepler's laws, a theory based on Newton's laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. In particular, Newton proposed that the gravitational force between any two bodies was a central force F(r) that varied as the inverse square of the distance r between them. Arguing from his laws of motion, Newton showed that the orbit of any particle acted upon by one such force is always a conic section, specifically an ellipse if it does not go to infinity. However, this conclusion holds only when two bodies are present (the <b>two-body</b> problem); the motion of three bodies or more acting under their mutual gravitation (the n-body problem) remained unsolved for centuries after Newton, although solutions to a few special cases were discovered. Newton proposed that the orbits of planets about the Sun are largely elliptical because the Sun's gravitation is dominant; to first approximation, the presence of the other planets can be ignored. By analogy, the elliptical orbit of the Moon about the Earth was dominated by the Earth's gravity; to first approximation, the Sun's gravity and those of other bodies of the Solar System can be neglected. However, Newton stated that the gradual apsidal precession of the planetary and lunar orbits was due to the effects of these neglected interactions; in particular, he stated that the precession of the Moon's orbit was due to the perturbing effects of gravitational interactions with the Sun.|$|E

25|$|While {{there are}} {{analytic}} solutions {{available for the}} classical (i.e. nonrelativistic) <b>two-body</b> problem and for selected configurations with , in general -body problems must be solved or simulated using numerical methods.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that while}} bound orbits {{of a point}} mass or a spherical body with a Newtonian {{gravitational}} field are closed ellipses, which repeat the same path exactly and indefinitely, any non-spherical or non-Newtonian effects (such as caused by the slight oblateness of the Earth, or by relativistic effects, thereby changing the gravitational field's behavior with distance) will cause the orbit's shape to depart from the closed ellipses characteristic of Newtonian <b>two-body</b> motion. The <b>two-body</b> solutions were published by Newton in Principia in 1687. In 1912, Karl Fritiof Sundman developed a converging infinite series that solves the three-body problem; however, it converges too slowly to be of much use. Except for special cases like the Lagrangian points, no method is known to solve the equations of motion for a system with four or more bodies.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>two-body</b> rotation, such as {{a planet}} and moon {{rotating}} about their common center of mass or barycentre, the forces on both bodies are centripetal. In that case, {{the reaction to the}} centripetal force of the planet on the moon is the centripetal force of the moon on the planet.|$|E
25|$|Orbital {{elements}} are the parameters required to uniquely identify a specific orbit. In celestial mechanics these {{elements are}} generally considered in classical <b>two-body</b> systems, where a Kepler orbit is used. There {{are many different}} ways to mathematically describe the same orbit, but certain schemes, each consisting {{of a set of}} six parameters, are commonly used in astronomy and orbital mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Unperturbed, <b>two-body,</b> Newtonian orbits {{are always}} conic sections, so the Keplerian {{elements}} define an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola. Real orbits have perturbations, so a given set of Keplerian elements accurately describes an orbit {{only at the}} epoch. Evolution of the orbital elements takes place due to the gravitational pull of bodies other than the primary, the nonsphericity of the primary, atmospheric drag, relativistic effects, radiation pressure, electromagnetic forces, and so on.|$|E
25|$|Any {{discussion}} of planetary interactive forces has always started historically with the <b>two-body</b> problem. The {{purpose of this}} Section is to relate the real complexity in calculating any planetary forces. Note in this Section also, several subjects, such as gravity, barycenter, Kepler's Laws, etc.; and in the following Section too (Three-body problem) are discussed on other Wikipedia pages. Here though, these subjects are discussed {{from the perspective of}} the -body problem.|$|E
25|$|In astrophysical {{systems with}} strong {{gravitational}} fields, {{such as those}} near the event horizon of a black hole, -body simulations {{must take into account}} general relativity; such simulations are the domain of numerical relativity. Numerically simulating the Einstein field equations is extremely challenging and a parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), such as the Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations, is used if possible. The <b>two-body</b> problem in general relativity is analytically solvable only for the Kepler problem, in which one mass is assumed to be much larger than the other.|$|E
25|$|Under Newtonian physics, a <b>two-body</b> system {{consisting}} of a lone object orbiting a spherical mass would trace out an ellipse with the spherical mass at a focus. The point of closest approach, called the periapsis (or, because the central body in the Solar System is the Sun, perihelion), is fixed. A number of effects in the Solar System cause the perihelia of planets to precess (rotate) around the Sun. The principal cause {{is the presence of}} other planets which perturb one another's orbit. Another (much less significant) effect is solar oblateness.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Newton's law of universal gravitation in the 17th century, {{the stability of the}} Solar System has preoccupied many mathematicians, starting with Laplace. The stable orbits that arise in a <b>two-body</b> approximation ignore the influence of other bodies. The effect of these added interactions on the stability of the Solar System is very small, but at first it was not known whether they might add up over longer periods to significantly change the orbital parameters and lead to a completely different configuration, or whether some other stabilising effects might maintain the configuration of the orbits of the planets.|$|E
25|$|There are however {{problems}} with the shell model when an attempt is made to account for nuclear properties well away from closed shells. This has led to complex post hoc distortions of {{the shape of the}} potential well to fit experimental data, but the question remains whether these mathematical manipulations actually correspond to the spatial deformations in real nuclei. Problems with the shell model have led some to propose realistic <b>two-body</b> and three-body nuclear force effects involving nucleon clusters and then build the nucleus on this basis. Two such cluster models are the Close-Packed Spheron Model of Linus Pauling and the 2D Ising Model of MacGregor.|$|E
25|$|The Gross–Pitaevskii {{model of}} BEC is a {{physical}} approximation valid for certain classes of BECs. By construction, the GPE uses the following simplifications: it assumes that interactions between condensate particles are of the contact <b>two-body</b> type and also neglects anomalous contributions to self-energy. These assumptions are suitable mostly for the dilute three-dimensional condensates. If one relaxes any of these assumptions, the equation for the condensate wavefunction acquires the terms containing higher-order powers of the wavefunction. Moreover, for some physical systems the amount of such terms {{turns out to be}} infinite, therefore, the equation becomes essentially non-polynomial. The examples where this could happen are the Bose–Fermi composite condensates, effectively lower-dimensional condensates, and dense condensates and superfluid clusters and droplets.|$|E
25|$|This method {{consists}} of precisely measuring a star's {{position in the}} sky, and observing how that position changes over time. Originally, this was done visually, with hand-written records. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, this method used photographic plates, greatly improving the accuracy of the measurements as well as creating a data archive. If a star has a planet, then the gravitational influence of the planet will cause the star itself to move in a tiny circular or elliptical orbit. Effectively, star and planet each orbit around their mutual centre of mass (barycenter), as explained by solutions to the <b>two-body</b> problem. Since the star is much more massive, its orbit will be much smaller. Frequently, the mutual centre of mass will lie within the radius of the larger body. Consequently, it is easier to find planets around low-mass stars, especially brown dwarfs.|$|E
25|$|The Sun wobbles as it rotates {{around the}} galactic center, {{dragging}} the Solar System and Earth along with it. What mathematician Kepler did in arriving at his three famous equations was curve-fit the apparent {{motions of the}} planets using Tycho Brahe's data, and not curve-fitting their true circular motions about the Sun (see Figure). Both Robert Hooke and Newton were well aware that Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation did not hold for the forces associated with elliptical orbits. In fact, Newton's Universal Law {{does not account for}} the orbit of Mercury, the asteroid belt's gravitational behavior, or Saturn's rings. Newton stated (in section 11 of the Principia) that the main reason, however, for failing to predict the forces for elliptical orbits was that his math model was for a body confined to a situation that hardly existed in the real world, namely, the motions of bodies attracted toward an unmoving center. Some present physics and astronomy textbooks do not emphasize the negative significance of Newton's assumption and end up teaching that his math model is in effect reality. It is to be understood that the classical <b>two-body</b> problem solution above is a mathematical idealization. See also Kepler's first law of planetary motion.|$|E
25|$|If the {{collisions}} of body A and the gravific {{particles are}} fully elastic, {{the intensity of}} the reflected particles would be as strong as of the incoming ones, so no net directional force would arise. The same is true if a second body B is introduced, where B acts as a shield against gravific particles in the direction of A. The gravific particle C which ordinarily would strike on A is blocked by B, but another particle D which ordinarily would not have struck A, is re-directed by the reflection on B, and therefore replaces C. Thus if the collisions are fully elastic, the reflected particles between A and B would fully compensate any shadowing effect. In order to account for a net gravitational force, it must be assumed that the collisions are not fully elastic, or at least that the reflected particles are slowed, so that their momentum is reduced after the impact. This would result in streams with diminished momentum departing from A, and streams with undiminished momentum arriving at A, so a net directional momentum toward the center of A would arise (P3). Under this assumption, the reflected particles in the <b>two-body</b> case will not fully compensate the shadowing effect, because the reflected flux is weaker than the incident flux.|$|E
500|$|This {{definition}} of the LRL vector A pertains to a single point particle of mass [...] moving under the action of a fixed force. [...] However, the same definition may be extended to <b>two-body</b> problems such as Kepler's problem, by taking [...] as the reduced mass of the two bodies and r as the vector between the two bodies.|$|E
500|$|Single-apparition or non-periodic comets {{are similar}} to long-period comets because they also have {{parabolic}} or slightly hyperbolic trajectories when near perihelion in the inner Solar System. However, gravitational perturbations from giant planets cause their orbits to change. Single-apparition comets have a hyperbolic or parabolic osculating orbit which allows them to permanently exit the Solar System after a single pass of the Sun. The Sun's Hill sphere has an unstable maximum boundary of 230,000 AU (...) [...] Only a few hundred comets have been seen to reach a hyperbolic orbit (e > 1) when near perihelion that using a heliocentric unperturbed <b>two-body</b> best-fit suggests they may escape the Solar System.|$|E
500|$|In 1935, Vladimir Fock {{showed that}} the quantum {{mechanical}} bound Kepler problem {{is equivalent to the}} problem of a free particle confined to a three-dimensional unit sphere in four-dimensional space. [...] Specifically, Fock {{showed that the}} Schrödinger wavefunction in the momentum space for the Kepler problem was the stereographic projection of the spherical harmonics on the sphere. [...] Rotation of the sphere and reprojection results in a continuous mapping of the elliptical orbits without changing the energy; quantum mechanically, this corresponds to a mixing of all orbitals of the same energy quantum number n. [...] Valentine Bargmann noted subsequently that the Poisson brackets for the angular momentum vector L and the scaled LRL vector D formed the Lie algebra for SO(4). [...] Simply put, the six quantities D and L correspond to the six conserved angular momenta in four dimensions, associated with the six possible simple rotations in that space (there are six ways of choosing two axes from four). [...] This conclusion does not imply that our universe is a three-dimensional sphere; it merely means that this particular physics problem (the <b>two-body</b> problem for inverse-square central forces) is mathematically equivalent to a free particle on a three-dimensional sphere.|$|E
