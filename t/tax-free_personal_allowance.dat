City AM editor Allister Heath said of this report, [...] "rarely has a think-tank publication been this influential so quickly.

500|$|England's {{economy is}} one of the largest in the world, with an average GDP per capita of £22,907. Usually {{regarded}} as a mixed market economy, it has adopted many free market principles, yet maintains an advanced social welfare infrastructure. The official currency in England is the pound sterling, whose ISO 4217 code is GBP. Taxation in England is quite competitive when compared to much of the rest of Europe – [...] the basic rate of personal tax is 20% on taxable income up to £31,865 above the <b>personal</b> <b>tax-free</b> <b>allowance</b> (normally £10,000), and 40% on any additional earnings above that amount.|$|R
50|$|As part of {{the fiscal}} {{measurements}} in Latvia, the Latvian government has introduced several measurements to reduce its deficit. The expenditure cuts centred the adjustments as the wage bill was trimmed by 4% of GDP (constituted roughly 30% wage cut for central government employees), pensions cut by 10% (later revoked by Constitutional Court) and investment by 3% of GDP. The measurements were estimated at 6.7% of Latvia GDP.On the revenue end, personal income tax was increased from 23% to 26%, <b>tax-free</b> <b>personal</b> income tax <b>allowance</b> was cut to €50/month (from €125/month), VAT was increased by 3% to 21% (2009) followed by another 1% to 22% (2011), while the reduced rates increased by 5% to 10%. Employee social contribution was raise from 9% to 11%. On top of that, excise duties on tobacco, alcohol, and energy were increased along with vehicle taxes. Subsequently, progressive real estate tax was introduced in 2009 that doubled effective from 2011 onwards. The revenue budget was about 2.8% of Latvia GDP.In strengthening the financial sector, new internal FCMC (The Financial and Capital Market Commission) guidelines has been introduced to specify prompt remedial action for troubled banks before regulatory thresholds are breached. New amendments on the Law on Credit Institutions means that FCMC may intervene troubled banks in Latvia. Under the Law on Bank Takeovers, government may take over the banks in Latvia when deemed necessary.|$|R
50|$|The <b>personal</b> tax <b>allowance</b> differs {{depending}} on age. For under 65s the <b>personal</b> tax <b>allowance</b> is €5,151.

25|$|The <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> is a {{standard}} deduction from ordinary income, meaning that it is given in all income (wages, pensions, capital and business income). Single parents and married couples where one spouse has a low income may be taxed in Class 2 and thus given double <b>personal</b> <b>allowance.</b> In 2010, the <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> was NOK 42,210 in Class 1 and NOK 84,420 in Class 2.|$|R

50|$|In the UK tax system, <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> is the {{threshold}} above which income tax is levied on an individual's income. A person who receives less than his/her <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> in taxable income (such as earnings and some benefits) {{in a given}} tax year does not pay income tax; otherwise, tax must be paid according to how much is earned above this level. Certain residents {{are entitled to a}} larger <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> than others. Such groups include the over 65s (followed by an increased allowance for over 75s), blind people, and married couples where at least one person in the marriage (or civil partnership) was born before 6 April 1935.|$|R

25|$|Various {{changes were}} also {{made to the}} tax system which benefited workers on low and middle incomes. Married couples with low incomes benefited from the {{increases}} in the single <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> and marriage allowance. In 1965, the regressive allowance for national insurance contributions was abolished and the single <b>personal</b> <b>allowance,</b> marriage allowance and wife's earned income relief were increased. These allowances were further increased in the tax years 1969–70 and 1970–71. Increases in the age exemption and dependant relative's income limits benefited the low-income elderly. In 1967, new tax concessions were introduced for widows.|$|R

50|$|As part of {{his plans}} for the {{national}} budget for 2008 (his last as Chancellor of the Exchequer), Gordon Brown announced in 2007 that the reduced tax rate for low incomes would be abolished from April 2008. This meant that all income above the <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> and below the higher rate band would be taxed at 20%, with the effect that taxpayers earning above the <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> would be up to £232 worse off each year.|$|R

50|$|On 22 June 2010, the new Chancellor George Osborne, {{as part of}} the {{coalition}} deal which seeks to increase the <b>Personal</b> <b>Allowance</b> to £10,000 from April 2015, made the first increase of £1,000, making it £7475 for the 2011-12 tax year. During the 2011 Budget, the allowance was raised by £630 to £8,105 from April 2012. In 2013, George Osborne revised the plans to increase the <b>Personal</b> <b>Allowance</b> and bring forward to date at which it would reach the £10,000 target. This resulted in the allowance being raised to £9,440 from April 2013, before being increased to £10,000 from April 2014, a year earlier than originally planned.|$|R

30|$|Adam and Browne (2013), {{as well as}} OECD (2012), also {{calculate}} the reward to working a full tax year rather than not working at all. An increase in, say, the <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> {{does not affect the}} reward to working an additional week except for the small group of people who are working so little during the year that they have not used up their <b>personal</b> <b>allowance.</b> Or consider a person earning, for the tax year, in the 20 -percent bracket with an income just below the threshold for the 40 -percent bracket. A reduction in that threshold hardly affects the reward to working at all during the tax year but doubles the disincentive from the income tax for working an additional week.|$|R
5000|$|The {{upper limit}} is {{currently}} {{set at the}} figure at which the higher rate of Income Tax becomes chargeable for a person on the standard <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> for Income Tax {{in all parts of}} the UK except Scotland (which can set its own level for the tax threshold, but not for the NI upper limit). In the early 2000s the lower threshold for employee contributions was aligned with the standard <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> for Income Tax but has since diverged significantly, as illustrated in the following table.For 2015-16 there was therefore up to £304.80 payable by someone who has not reached the point where they are liable for Income Tax. This rose to £ 352.80 for 2016-17 and to £ 400.32 for 2017-18 ...|$|R
