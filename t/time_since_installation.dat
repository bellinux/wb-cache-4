40|$|We have {{developed}} a method to measure the counts in cosmic ray tails (CRTs) which result frim imperfect charge transfer efficiency (CTE). Like previous measures of CTE, the counts in the CRTs are a strong function {{of the number of}} serial and parallel transfers, background, source counts, and lifetime of the instrument. Analysis of the CRTs reveals that some charge is trapped and released on short timescales (<< seconds) although the charge in CRTs does not account for all observed CTE lossses. The time dependence of Y-CTE and X-CTE are shown for WFPC 2 and STIS using the STScI archive of dark calibration frames. All show a steady growth with <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>installation</b> of the respective instrment. There is also evidence for a mild increase in the growth rate (i. e. acceleration) of the WFPC 2 Y-CTE. The results indicate that this method may provide a precise way to monitor CTE with greater time sampling than is currently feasible and without the cost of additional pointed observations. 1...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{aetiology}} {{of multiple}} sclerosis (MS) remains poorly understood. Dental amal-gams containing mercury {{have recently been}} suggested as a possible risk factor for MS. Methods In a case-control study conducted between 1991 and 1994, we interviewed a total of 143 MS patients and 128 controls, to obtain information on socio-demographic characteristics {{and the number of}} dental amalgams and the <b>time</b> <b>since</b> <b>installation</b> based on dentists ' records. Results Neither the number nor the duration of exposure to amalgams supported an increased risk of MS. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, and education those who had more than 15 fillings had an odds ratio (OR) of 2. 57 (95 % CI: 0. 78 - 8. 54) compared to those who had none; for individuals whose first amalgam was inserted more than 15 years prior to the study, we found an OR of 1. 34 (95 % CI: 0. 38 - 4. 72). Conclusions Although a suggestive elevated risk was found for those individuals with a large number of dental amalgams, and {{for a long period of}} time, the difference be-tween cases and controls was not statistically significant...|$|E

40|$|The 14 UD {{has evolved}} {{over the past two}} years from {{acceptance}} tests to an extremely reliable and convenient research tool well suited to heavy-ion physics research. The development of the open corona point distribution system with the reintroduction of tie wires eliminated problems with gradient control and point lifetime. Easy inspection of the open points is a valuable diagnostic aid when beam transport problems occur. Electromechanical remote actuators for functions in the terminal have been replaced with pneumatic ones driven by SF 6 at 50 psi above tank pressure. Foils are changed, sublimer pellet heaters switched and a high energy tube entrance aperture selected by these devices. Long experience running from 6 to 13 MV has convinced us that enclosed corona points would not make our operation any more convenient. The machine is quite stable with negligible tube and column corona currents. Because of this, the machine typically runs with only one chain at a <b>time.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>installation</b> of SF 6 powered oilers for the chains, there have been no further problems of instability or breakage. An integral valve for the NEC stripper foil assembly has been installed to maintain the conditioned status of the tube during stripper foil changes. All main power wiring has been replaced with mineral insulated cable sheathed in copper. No degradation in insulation has been found...|$|E
40|$|The helium {{refrigerator}} was cooled {{down and}} operated {{for the third}} <b>time</b> <b>since</b> its <b>installation.</b> D-Zero's 2 Tesla superconducting solenoid was cooled down and operated for its second <b>time</b> <b>since</b> its <b>installation</b> into the D-Zero detector. This engineering note summarizes the cryogenic aspects of the test run and performance measurements made. The main purpose of this run was to do field mapping of the solenoid with different combinations of field polarity on the Solenoid and CF iron magnets. This was accomplished. A second purpose was to test the lower field joint repair that was done in January 1999. This field joint had a measurable voltage drop across the soldered bus splice. The repair was an undoing of the joint, extensive cleaning of the bus, and then welding the splice. The repair was successful, no voltage drop was measured and the magnet behaved nicely. A parasitic purpose was to get some operating time on the refrigerator, measure the refrigeration performance, and measure the heat leak in the VLPC lines mounted on the detector platform. Refrigerator performance was spot checked, and {{was found to be}} 60 watts (10 %) less than generic operating curves. At this level of performance, the operating margin for the full solenoid and VLPC system will be 75 watts (15 %) which is somewhat uncomfortable from an operational stand point. The VLPC lines were operated and heat leak numbers of around 40 watts was measured for each pipe section including the supply u-tubes to the detector, the bayonet can, valve box on the platform and the piping back to the refrigerator valve box. Another purpose of the test run was to test the compatibility of other detector components with the new central magnetic field environment. I do not know the results of these tests...|$|R
40|$|Clemson beaver pond {{levelers}} {{were developed}} {{as a tool to}} enable land managers to manipulate water flow past beaver (Castor canadensis) dams. Wildlife Services has installed several of these devices in collaboration with landowners. We conducted a survey to determine if we could identify factors that impacted whether the devices were meeting landowner objectives. Fifty percent of the 40 levelers surveyed were still operating and regarded as successful. Factors considered in the survey included management objectives, <b>time</b> <b>since</b> the leveler was installed, watershed characteristics, physical attributes of the stream and of the beaver dam where the leveler was installed, and beaver activity. Management objectives closely correlated with owner satisfaction; devices installed to manage wetlands (primarily waterfowl habitat) were generally considered successful, while devices installed to provide water relief through perpetual flow were deemed less successful. <b>Time</b> elapsed <b>since</b> <b>installation</b> was not a factor, however, maintenance of the levelers was a factor. Seventy percent of the operating levelers had received some form of post installation maintenance. Levelers placed in sites with high beaver activity without implementing population control measures frequently failed. Ninety-five percent of the sites with successful levelers had received some population control measure either before, or after, or before and after installing the leveler. Physical attributes of the site or characteristics of the beaver dam were not closely correlated with success of the levelers...|$|R
40|$|Background: Epidemiological data on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) have enphasized {{the role}} of both genetic and {{environmental}} factors in the etiology. Despite the weakness of biological plausibility, dental amalgams containing mercury have been suggested as a possible risk factor. Methods: In a community-based case-control study {{carried out in the}} Province of Ferrara, we interviewed 132 MS cases with diseases onset during the last 10 years and 423 controls, to obtain information on socio-demographic characteristics and the number of dental amalgams and the <b>time</b> <b>since</b> their <b>installation.</b> Results: Odds ratios (OR) for subjects with exposures of different duration and with different numbers of amalgams were not statistically significant. The comparison between subjects with no fillings and those with protracted exposures to many amalgams did not give significant results. The group with exposure before 15 years of age did not seem to have larger OR than those with exposure beginning later in life. Conclusions: Neither the number nor the duration of exposure to amalgams supported the hypothesis of an increased risk ofMS, in agreement with another study carried out in Canada and addressing the same topic...|$|R
40|$|The {{horizontal}} pendulums of the Grotta Gigante (Giant Cave) in the Trieste Karst, are long-base tiltmeters with Z¨ollner type suspension. The instruments {{have been}} continuously recording tilt and shear in the Grotta Gigante since {{the date of}} their installation by Prof. Antonio Marussi in 1966. Their setup has been completely overhauled several <b>times</b> <b>since</b> <b>installation,</b> restricting the interruptions of the measurements though to a minimum. The continuous recordings, apart from some interruptions, cover thus almost 40 years of measurements, producing a very noticeable long-term tiltmeter record of crustal deformation. The original recording system, still in function, was photographic with a mechanical timing and paper-advancing system, which has never given any problems at all, as it is very stable and not vulnerable by external factors as high humidity, problems in power supply, lightning or similar. In December 2003 a new recording system was installed, based on a solid-state acquisition system intercepting a laser light reflected from a mirror mounted on the horizontal pendulum beam. The sampling rate is 30 Hz, which turns the longbase instrument to a very-broad-band tiltmeter, apt to record the tilt signal on a broad-band of frequencies, ranging from secular deformation rate through the earth tides to seismic waves. Here we describe the acquisition system and present two endline members of the instrumental observation, the up to date long-term recording, and the observation of the great Sumatra-Andaman Islands earthquake of December 26, 2004, seismic moment magnitude Mw = 9. 1 – 9. 3 [Lay, T., Kanamori, H., Ammon, C. J., Nettles, M., Ward, S. N., Aster, R. C., Beck, S. L., Bilek, S. L., Brudzinski, M. L., Butler, R., DeShon, H. R., Ekstr¨om, G., Satake, K., Sipkin, S., 2005. The Great Sumatra-Andaman Earthquake of 26 December 2004. Science. 308, 1127 – 1133. ]. The secular-term observations indicate an average tilting {{over the last four}} decades towards NW of 23. 4 nrad/year. We find evidences that this tilting is regional and has been going on since at least 125 ka. The recent earthquake of December 26, 2004 was well recorded by the pendulums. We show that the free oscillation modes were activated, including the lowest modes as e. g. 0 T 2, 0 T 3, 0 T 4, 0 T 5 and 2 S 1, 0 S 3, 0 S 4, 1 S 2...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} report {{chronicles the}} University of North Texas Wind Turbine Project at Apogee Stadium. The timeline of events {{will include the}} feasibility study conducted by and for the university, grant awards from the Texas State Energy Conservation Office to fund the project, and a three-year sample of real <b>time</b> performance data <b>since</b> <b>installation.</b> The purpose of this case study is to compare the energy generation estimates by various stakeholders to the measured energy generation using a new but uniform performance relationship. In order to optimize energy generation in wind turbine generator systems, the most common wind speeds measured at the site should also be the most efficient wind speeds at which the wind turbine can convert the kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical energy and ultimately electrical energy. The tool used to convey this relationship will be a figure plotting the wind speed profile against the efficiency curve of the wind turbine. Applying this relationship tool to the UNT Apogee Stadium wind turbines provided valuable results. The most common wind speeds at Apogee Stadium are not the most efficient wind speed for the turbine. Also, the most common wind speeds were near the lower limit of the wind turbine’s performance parameters. This scenario was evident in both the energy generation predictions {{as well as the}} real-time recorded data. This case study will also present the economic analysis of the Apogee Stadium wind turbines using another tool that was not previously used in the feasibility study. The case study concludes with future steps to improve wind turbine performance, and to budget future cost using past, present and future energy savings...|$|R

40|$|Loss of tree {{cavities}} {{presents a}} threat to tree roosting echolocating bat populations. Bat boxes {{have been used for}} over a century to provide artificial cavities. The aims of this review were to provide a synthesis of bat box use in temperate parts of the world, to discuss the applications and effectiveness of bat boxes, to provide box deployment recommendations and to identify areas requiring further research. The 109 publications reviewed originated from four regions. The majority were from Europe (70 %) followed by North America (16 %), Australia (12 %) and Asia (3 %). Publications reported box use for research (n = 67), conservation management (n = 42) and public bat awareness (n = 1). The most commonly used bat box designs could be divided into five basic types, four originating from Europe and one from North America. Woodcement as a box material was frequently used in Europe and was practically absent elsewhere with timber boxes most commonly used overall. Seventy-one species of bats have been recorded using boxes, although only 18 were identified as using boxes commonly and 31 species were reported to have formed maternity roosts. The lack of maternity and overwintering roost records in boxes is a concern. There is a need to test current box types across geographical regions and to develop designs further. Where boxes are used as a conservation tool, consideration should be given to the long-term maintenance costs of a box program. Unless known to be unsuitable to target species, boxes should be made from durable materials, be unattractive to non-target species and be ‘self-cleaning’. Deploying a variety of box designs in clusters, <b>time</b> <b>since</b> box <b>installation,</b> non-target species box competition and target species-specific box design elements are likely influencing box uptake. The provision of boxes that comprise different microclimates and box aspects are likely best suited to meet the varying needs of a given tree roosting echolocating bat community. No conclusive evidence was found that box installation height is important for box uptake. There is concern that boxes may provide a competitive advantage for bat species commonly using boxes. Bat boxes should not be used as a justification for the removal of trees that comprise potential roost cavities...|$|R
