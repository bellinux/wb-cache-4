25|$|A BBC TV {{biography}} about Frankie Howerd, Rather You <b>Than</b> <b>Me,</b> {{was broadcast}} by BBC Four on 9 April 2008, and repeated on 10 February 2013.

25|$|Federal land grants helped {{each state}} create an {{agricultural}} {{college and a}} network of extension agents who demonstrated modern techniques to farmers. Wheat and cotton farmers in the 1890s supported the Populist movement, but failed in their demands for free silver and inflation. Instead the 1896 election committed the nation to the gold standard and a program of sustained industrialization. Farmers in the Midwest and East gave verbal support to the Populists. They focused on the nearby urban markets, rather <b>than</b> <b>me</b> highly fluctuating European markets for weaving cotton.|$|E
25|$|I wasn't {{meant to}} be the lead singer of the band. My whole idea was to play the {{saxophone}} and I really wanted Stephen Cummings to be the singer, 'cause we were really great mates but for whatever reason he bowed out after {{just a couple of}} rehearsals. We had a full list of songs by Wayne Burt and that really made the difference for us. I wasn't writing any songs really and I thought Wayne was a much better singer <b>than</b> <b>me</b> as well but he didn't want to be the lead singer, so we sort of shared it around for a little while. – Joe Camilleri.|$|E

25|$|Throughout his career, Howerd hid his {{potentially}} career-destroying homosexuality (acts between consenting males being {{illegal in}} England and Wales until 1967) from both his audience and his mother, Edith. In 1958, he met wine waiter Dennis Heymer at the Dorchester Hotel while dining with Sir John Mills; Howerd was 40 and Heymer was 28. Heymer became his lover {{as well as}} manager, and stayed with him for more than thirty years, until Howerd's death, with Heymer helping to revive Howerd's flagging career in the 1960s. However, the two had to remain discreet as Howerd feared being blackmailed if anyone beyond his immediate circle found out. The relationship was explored in 2008 in a drama for BBC Four, Rather You <b>Than</b> <b>Me,</b> starring David Walliams and Rafe Spall.|$|E
25|$|I grew up {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis {{and all that kind}} of stuff. And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older <b>than</b> <b>me,</b> so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E
500|$|Corgan was {{deliberately}} {{setting out to}} widen his band's sound and message, explaining {{that he was not}} [...] "talking to teenagers anymore. I'm talking to everyone now. It's a wider dialogue. I'm talking to people who are older <b>than</b> <b>me</b> and younger <b>than</b> <b>me,</b> and our generation as well." [...] He said that much of the record was [...] "an attempt to go back to what's important at a musical core and build it outward." [...] He would later reflect that he was [...] "stuck on the idea that I needed to prove I was an artist, which is the death knell of any artist".|$|E
50|$|Given that AMEs do {{transfer}} interocularly, it {{is reasonable}} to suppose that they must occur in higher, binocular regions of the brain. Despite producing a less saturated illusory color, the induction of an AME may override a previously induced ME, providing additional weight to the argument that AMEs occur in the higher visual areas <b>than</b> <b>MEs.</b>|$|R

500|$|She began a {{relationship}} with Liverpudlian chauffeur Jim Christie in 1981, who became her partner for 17 years {{as well as her}} business manager, living in Penrith, Cumbria. She said at the time: [...] "Jim has never felt he's living in John Lennon's shadow. He's four years younger <b>than</b> <b>me</b> and wasn't really part of that whole Beatles' scene." [...] They later lived on the Isle of Man and then Normandy for some years, but separated in 1998.|$|E
500|$|In one of {{his final}} interviews, Carradine stated that at 71, he was still [...] "in {{excellent}} shape," [...] attributing it to a good diet and having a youthful circle of friends. [...] "Everybody that I know is at least 10 or 20 years younger than I am. My wife Annie is 24 years younger than I am.

[...] Perelman stalked off in a rage. In accepting her award, she gave an acceptance speech honoring previous black actresses who had never had the opportunity. She said, [...] "This moment is so much bigger <b>than</b> <b>me.</b> This is for every nameless, faceless woman of colour who now has a chance tonight because this door has been opened." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The {{whole time}} I {{definitely}} was thinking, 'Everyone knows, everyone can see.'...I {{just wanted to}} give everything I could... When you're pregnant, it's {{a little bit harder}} to breathe, so it was hard doing all the choreography and singing at the same time. I just got my strength from all the love from the fans. I can see all of my super fans in the audience when I'm performing because they're doing the choreography harder <b>than</b> <b>me.</b> Some of the fans were like, 'B, you better put me in this DVD.' So I made sure I did." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} when the advert {{first appeared on}} how it was made– whether the gorilla was real, animatronic, or {{a man in a}} suit. Many believed that Phil Collins himself was the drummer. When asked about Gorilla, Collins jokingly commented that [...] "Not only is he a better drummer <b>than</b> <b>me,</b> he also has more hair. Can he sing too?" [...] "In the Air Tonight" [...] became a popular online download following its appearance in the commercial, reaching a chart position of 14 within the UK Singles Chart despite not being given a physical re-release, and becoming the third-most-downloaded track of the day on the iTunes Store.|$|E

500|$|... "I've had 20 {{years of}} fame and fortune, and I feel that I {{have a right to}} an opinion on what it is and what it isn't.

Then you arrive... Look like this you're gonna be happy. Drive this car you're gonna be popular. Wear these clothes and people are gonna wanna fuck you. It's a very powerful illusion and people are caught up in it, including myself. Or I was." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Give Me All Your Luvin" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Martin Solveig, Nicki Minaj, M.I.A., and Michael Tordjman, while {{production}} was helmed by Madonna and Solveig.

500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews and good chart {{position of the}} lead single, 1000 Fires did not achieve mainstream success. Lords later commented: [...] "The problem with that album {{was that it was}} ahead of its time. Electronica was just starting to happen. Moby was just starting to be huge. I opened for Thrill Kill Kult and Moby as a DJ back then. The masses didn't know who Moby was. I think if it had been slightly delayed it would have done better. Madonna had it right to wait for Ray of Light. She has been a lot better with her timing <b>than</b> <b>me.</b> I am proud of that album because I hear it now and it still feels current. It doesn't feel dated." ...|$|E
500|$|Two songs, [...] "Low Down Freedom" [...] and [...] "Black Rose," [...] were {{produced}} by Ronny Light. [...] "We Had It All" [...] {{was produced by}} Jennings and Ken Mansfield. [...] Like the music within, the album cover was also {{at odds with the}} elaborate, often overwrought cover designs from Music Row, featuring an unpretentious shot of a smiling Jennings and his unkempt friends sat around a studio laughing and drinking. [...] In a 2008 interview with Dan MacIntosh, Shaver said of the LP, [...] "Oh, it was great, because the songs were bigger <b>than</b> <b>me.</b> And I couldn't possibly sing as good as Waylon. And at the time, Waylon was just great, so great, and I knew something was gonna happen good for him, and sure enough it helped me and it helped him, too, and that's a pretty good trade." ...|$|E

[...] As a result, he could lift double the weight he could before the training. [...] With respect to his training regimen, Ohno said: [...] "Come these Games, there's no one who's going to be fitter <b>than</b> <b>me.</b> There's just no way. Whether I can put it together on the ice or not and feel good, that's a different story. But I know, from a physical training standpoint, nobody's even close...
