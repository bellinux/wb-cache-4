500|$|In late 2000, Destiny's Child {{announced}} their plan {{to embark on}} individual side projects, including releases of solo albums, an idea by their manager. In 2002, Williams released her solo album, Heart <b>to</b> <b>Yours,</b> a contemporary gospel collection. The album reached {{number one on the}} Billboard Top Gospel Albums chart. In the same date Heart <b>to</b> <b>Yours</b> hit stores, Destiny's Child released their official autobiography, Soul Survivors.

Meanwhile, Beyoncé debuted on the big screen, starring in the comedy film Austin Powers in Goldmember, and recorded her debut single, [...] "Work It Out", which is featured on the soundtrack to the film. Rowland collaborated with American rapper Nelly on the song [...] "Dilemma" [...] as a featured artist; it became a hit that year, leading the label to advance the release date of her debut solo album, Simply Deep, in late 2002.

It contains {{a greater percentage of}} mid and up-tempo songs, along with a much heavier and grander use of live instrumentation. Williams contributed lyrically to the album as she did with her debut album, co-writing a total of six songs.
