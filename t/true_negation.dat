5000|$|In logic, negation, {{also called}} logical complement, is an {{operation}} that takes a proposition p to another proposition [...] "not p", written ¬p, which is interpreted intuitively as being true when p is false, and false when p is <b>true.</b> <b>Negation</b> is thus a unary (single-argument) logical connective. It may be applied as an operation on propositions, truth values, or semantic values more generally. In classical logic, negation is normally identified with the truth function that takes truth to falsity and vice versa. In intuitionistic logic, according to the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation, the negation of a proposition p is the proposition whose proofs are the refutations of p.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} verbs {{and answering}} particles in minimal answers to yes-no questions in Czech. It is first argued that minimal answers involve ellipsis of the clause (IP) including second position clitics {{except for the}} verb that moves to the CP domain and the particles that are generated in the polarity projection in the CP domain. The verb moves to the FocP because it bears the polarity feature that is focused in polar question-answer pairs. Other focused XPs can also move to FocP. Negative questions are then argued to contain expletive or <b>true</b> <b>negation.</b> In the former case, they behave as positive (open) questions, while in the latter case, they behave as negative declaratives, i. e. convey a negative presupposition and have a fixed polarity. Negative questions containing <b>true</b> <b>negation</b> are confirmed by 'ano' (yes) and denied by 'ne' (no), because the particles here (dis) confirm the polarityof the presupposition conveyed by the question. To account for distribution of the particles, we propose that particles express two kinds of polarity: (i) absolute polarity [+] or [–] in answers to open questions, and (ii) relative polarity [same] or [reverse] in answers to questions with fixed polarity. Relative polarity simply indicates whether the polarity of the question {{and that of the}} answer are identical or different. The proposed analysis does not claim that there are two ano or ne in the lexicon. Rather, each particle is a single lexical item, whose polarity is interpreted in an absolute or in a relative way...|$|E

In contrast to Graphplan, IPP does not generate the planning graph explicitely, but builds only one fact and action layer.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a logic {{formalism}} that naturally supports the encoding of complex security specifications. This formalism relies on a hierarchically structured domain made of subjects, objects and privileges. Authorizations are expressed by logic rules. The formalism supports both negation by failure (possibly unstratified) and <b>true</b> <b>negation.</b> The latter is used to express negative authorizations. It turns out that conflicts may result from a set of authorization rules. Dealing with such conflicts requires the knowledge of the domain structure, such as grantor priorities and object/subject hierarchies, which is used in the deductive process to determine which authorization prevails, if any, on the others. Often, however, conflicts are unsolvable, as they express intrinsic ambiguities.

5000|$|Logical {{determinism}} is {{the view}} that a proposition about the future is either necessarily <b>true,</b> or its <b>negation</b> is necessarily <b>true.</b> The argument for this is as follows.

It is shown that answering particles can express {{both positive and negative}} answers to negative questions, but that their choice is not free. Several pieces of evidence are discussed in order to show that the use of the particles depends on the interpretation of negation in the question: expletive negation or <b>true</b> <b>negation.</b> This semantic distinction is furthermore tightly linked to the syntactic position of the negation, according to which we distinguish between negative interrogative clauses and negative declarative clauses used as questions. An analysis in terms of absolute and relative polarity is proposed to account for the mixed behaviour of answering particles: particles express absolute polarity in answers to interrogative questions, whose polarity is open, and relative polarity in answers to declarative questions, whose polarity has been already specified...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPrevious {{researchers}} have proposed extensions of logic programming {{to deal with}} <b>true</b> <b>negation</b> and defeasible reasoning. Ordered Logic (OL) achieves both such goals by allowing rules with negated heads {{in the context of}} an inheritance hierarchy. As a result, OL is inherently nonmonotonic. Another area of interest in logic programming is that dealing with the semantics of negation. Recent research focuses on both declarative and constructive characterizations of stable models. A peculiarity of this semantics is that a program may have several alternative models (even none), each corresponding to a possible view of the world. This endows logic programming with the power to express don't-care nondeterminism in a purely declarative framework. This paper describes a stable model semantics (SMSOL) and its computation for ordered logic programs. SMSOL is given both in a model-theoretic and a constructive fashion. Based on the latter, an effective method is proposed for computing OL stable models. An interesting aspect of the proposed approach is that ordered logic programming can simulate Datalog under the total stable model semantics. This clearly provides solidity to our proposal. Moreover, the SMSOL computation method is an effective way to compute the stable model semantics of Datalog programs. The computational complexity of the main reasoning tasks in SMSOL is also investigated...|$|E
40|$|Since SNOMED-RT/CT was {{originally}} formulated {{in the early}} to mid 1990 s, there have been major developments in logic-based formalisms, ontology design and associated tools. Combined with the increase in computing power in the past two decades, these developments mean that many of the restrictions that limited SNOMED’s original formulation and schemas no longer need apply. We contend that future development of SNOMED would be made easier if a more expressive formalism and more modern tools were adopted. The difficulties in the existing structure of SNOMED have been well documented. For example, Bodenreider (1) examined the specialization hierarchy of SNOMED classes. Schulz discussed ‘relationship groups ’ (2) and a broad range of other ontological problems along with potential remedies (3). Schulz suggested a modest extension of SNOMED’s formalism to one with more clearly defined semantics (EL+) but which still lacks <b>true</b> <b>negation</b> and disjunction. We argue here that judicious use of a more expressive language, OWL 1. 1 1, is now practical and would bring great benefits including: A uniform, clear and understandable schema for all concepts used in clinical records, including context and negation. Elimination of the need for special mechanisms to deal with context, partonomy, and role groups. More effective leveraging of the underlying logical representation to organise and quality assure the SNOMED hierarchies. Improved ability to recognise semantic equivalence between post-coordinated and precoordinated expressions and between “observables” with “values ” and the corresponding “findings. ” Improved ability to modularise and segment SNOMED for specific purposes • Access to the tools and techniques being developed by the wider Semantic Web and OWL communities.

It is said usually (1) that propositions are true (2) only propositions are true (3) that it is facts that make propositions true. We all understand what is meant when we say "propositions are that of which true and false are predicated and it is facts which make propositions true or false. " My first question is to give an answer to the question "What is it that makes propositions true or false?" I give therefore an answer to the question "What Is a fact?"I then raise the question whether there are particular kinds of facts called negative facts which make negative propositions true, I am led to suppose that there is no particular kind of fact such as this. The facts which make propositions containing no <b>negation</b> <b>true</b> make also propositions containing <b>negations</b> <b>true.</b> I am led then to suggest a view of the relation between true proposition and fact. The relation of true proposition to fact Is the formal one of entailing and determinate communication: The relation of false proposition to fact follows. I suggest that the relation of false proposition to fact is that relation which is the relative product of the relations 'contrary or contradictory of', 'entailing', and 'determinate communication'.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer founded {{intuitionism}} as {{a philosophy of}} mathematics. This philosophy, poorly understood at first, stated {{that in order for}} a mathematical statement to be true to a mathematician, that person must be able to intuit the statement, to not only believe its truth but understand the reason for its truth. A consequence of this definition of truth was the rejection of the law of the excluded middle, for there are statements that, according to Brouwer, could not be claimed to be <b>true</b> while their <b>negations</b> also could not be claimed true. [...] Brouwer's philosophy was influential, and the cause of bitter disputes among prominent mathematicians. Later, Kleene and Kreisel would study formalized versions of intuitionistic logic (Brouwer rejected formalization, and presented his work in unformalized natural language). With the advent of the BHK interpretation and Kripke models, intuitionism became easier to reconcile with classical mathematics.|$|R
2500|$|The metaphysical {{distinction}} between necessary and contingent truths {{has also been}} related to a priori and a posteriori knowledge. A proposition that is necessarily true is one whose negation is self-contradictory (thus, {{it is said to}} be true in every possible world). Consider the proposition that all bachelors are unmarried. Its negation, the proposition that some bachelors are married, is incoherent, because the concept of being unmarried (or {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "unmarried") is part of the concept of being a bachelor (or part of the definition of the word [...] "bachelor"). To the extent that contradictions are impossible, self-contradictory propositions are necessarily false, because it is impossible for them to be <b>true.</b> Thus, the <b>negation</b> of a self-contradictory proposition is supposed to be necessarily true. By contrast, a proposition that is contingently true is one whose negation is not self-contradictory (thus, it is said that it is not true in every possible world). As Jason Baehr states, it seems plausible that all necessary propositions are known a priori, because [...] "ense experience can tell us only about the actual world and hence about what is the case; it can say nothing about what must or must not be the case." ...|$|R

But that the square of the hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides, can not be known immediately by comparison of two states of consciousness: here the truth can be reached only mediately, through a series of simple judgments respecting the likenesses or unlikenesses of certain relations.” Moreover, even when the proposition admits of being tested by immediate consciousness, people often neglect to do it. A school-boy, in adding up a column of figures, will say “35 and 9 are 46,” though this is contrary to the verdict which consciousness gives when 35 and 9 are really called up before it; but this is not done. And not only school-boys, but men and thinkers, do not always “distinctly translate into their equivalent states of consciousness the words they use.” ...|$|R
40|$|This {{self-contained}} lecture examines {{uses and}} misuses of the adverb conversely with {{special attention to}} logic and logic-related fields. Sometimes adding conversely after a conjunction such as and signals redundantly that a converse of what preceded will follow. (1) Tarski read Church and, conversely, Church read Tarski. In such cases, conversely serves as an extrapropositional constituent of the sentence in which it occurs: deleting conversely doesn’t change the proposition expressed. Nevertheless it does introduce new implicatures: a speaker would implicate belief that the second sentence expresses a converse of what the first expresses. Perhaps because such usage is familiar, the word conversely {{can be used as}} “sentential pronoun”—or prosentence—representing a sentence expressing a converse of what the preceding sentence expresses. (2) Tarski read Church and conversely. This would be understood as expressing the proposition expressed by (1). Prosentential usage introduces ambiguity when the initial proposition has more than one converse. Confusion can occur if the initial proposition has non-equivalent converses. Every proposition that is the negation of a false proposition is true and conversely. One sense implies that every proposition that is the <b>negation</b> of a <b>true</b> proposition is false, which is true of course. But another sense, probably more likely, implies that every proposition that is <b>true</b> is the <b>negation</b> of a false proposition, which is false: the proposition that one precedes two is not a negation and thus is not the negation of a false proposition. The above also applies to synonyms of conversely such as vice versa. Although prosentence has no synonym, extrapropositional constituents are sometimes called redundant rhetoric, filler, or expletive. Authors discussed include Aristotle, Boole, De Morgan, Peirce, Frege, Russell, Tarski, and Church. END OF PUBLISHED ABSTRACT See also: Corcoran, John. 2015. Converses, inner and outer. 2015.

60|$|In the {{dissertation}} which Mr. Herbert Spencer has prefixed to his, in many respects, highly philosophical {{treatise on}} the Mind,(91) he criticises {{some of the}} doctrines of the two preceding chapters, and propounds a theory of his own {{on the subject of}} first principles. Mr. Spencer agrees with me in considering axioms to be “simply our earliest inductions from experience.” But he differs from me “widely as to the worth of the test of inconceivableness.” He thinks that it is the ultimate test of all beliefs. He arrives at this conclusion by two steps. First, we never can have any stronger ground for believing any thing, than that the belief of it “invariably exists.” Whenever any fact or proposition is invariably believed; that is, if I understand Mr. Spencer rightly, believed by all persons, and by one’s self at all times; it is entitled to be received as one of the primitive truths, or original premises of our knowledge. Secondly, the criterion by which we decide whether any thing is invariably believed to be true, is our inability to conceive it as false. “The inconceivability of its negation is the test by which we ascertain whether a given belief invariably exists or not.” “For our primary beliefs, the fact of invariable existence, tested by an abortive effort to cause their non-existence, is the only reason assignable.” He thinks this the sole ground of our belief in our own sensations. If I believe that I feel cold, I only receive this as true because I can not conceive that I am not feeling cold. “While the proposition remains <b>true,</b> the <b>negation</b> of it remains inconceivable.” There are numerous other beliefs which Mr. Spencer considers to rest on the same basis; being chiefly those, or a part of those, which the metaphysicians of the Reid and Stewart school consider as truths of immediate intuition. That there exists a material world; that this is the very world which we directly and immediately perceive, and not merely the hidden cause of our perceptions; that Space, Time, Force, Extension, Figure, are not modes of our consciousness, but objective realities; are regarded by Mr. Spencer as truths known by the inconceivableness of their negatives. We can not, he says, by any effort, conceive these objects of thought as mere states of our mind; as not having an existence external to us. Their real existence is, therefore, as certain as our sensations themselves. The truths which are the subject of direct knowledge, being, according to this doctrine, known to be truths only by the inconceivability of their negation; and the truths which are not the object of direct knowledge, being known as inferences from those which are; and those inferences being believed to follow from the premises, only because we can not conceive them not to follow; inconceivability is thus the ultimate ground of all assured beliefs.|$|R
