It had been well, had you immediately believed Him when He came, and known Him, as He whom Moses and all the prophets signified, Who should {{put an end to}} the law, and reveal the common salvation of all men, so that it should be manifest to all, that this is the sum and chief good of the whole dispensation of the law, to bring all men to the Lord Christ, Who, for those great goods, should be manifested in His own time. But since, when He manifested Himself, ye manifested your own ungainliness, the blessed Elias shall be sent to you before the second Coming of Christ, when He will come from heaven, to unite those who, for religion, are separated from each other, and, through the knowledge of religion, to bring the fathers to one-mindedness with the children, and in a word, to bring all men to one and the same harmony, when those, then found in ungodliness, shall receive from him the knowledge of the truth in the communion with the godly thence ensuing." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{the rapid}} {{deterioration}} of the China front after Japanese launched Operation Ichi-Go in 1944, Stilwell saw {{this as an opportunity}} to gain full command of all Chinese armed forces. Operation Ichi-Go was the largest Japanese offensive of World War II designed to [...] "liquidate the China affair" [...] by knocking China out of the war once and for all that saw some half-million men and 800 tanks, supplied by 70 to 100, 000 horses dragging wagons and 12, 000 to 15, 000 vehicles committed to an operation that overran huge areas of China. Stillwell clashed with Chiang over the question of the city of Guilin, which was besieged by the Japanese. Chiang wanted Guilin defended to the last men while Stillwell claimed Guilin was a lost cause. In his diary, Stillwell wrote: [...] "What <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to shoot the G-mo [...] and Ho [...] and the rest of the gang". Stillwell ordered the American troops to pull out of Guilin, and was able to persuade Chiang to reluctantly accept the loss of Guilin. The clash over Guilin was only a prelude to another clash, where Chiang demanded the return of the Y Force from Burma to defend Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, which was also threatened by the Japanese advance. After meeting Chiang, Stilwell wrote in his diary that Chiang was a [...] "crazy little bastard with that hickory nut he uses for a head... Usual cockeyed reasons and idiotic tactical and strategic conceptions. He is impossible!".|$|E

40|$|Individuals have {{various kinds}} of obligations: keep promises, don’t cause harm, return {{benefits}} received from injustices, be partial to loved ones, help the needy and so on. How does this work for group agents? There are two questions here. The first is whether groups can bear {{the same kinds of}} obligations as individuals. The second is whether groups’ pro tanto obligations plug into what <b>they</b> all-things-considered <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> the same degree that individuals’ pro tanto obligations plug into what <b>they</b> all-things-considered <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> We argue for parity on both count...|$|R

60|$|Delia was {{accustomed}} to use the dolls {{not only for the}} purpose of instruction, but sometimes for reproof, in many ingenious ways.

6000|$|You {{remember}} {{the story of}} the tower of Babel? How certain of Noah's family forgot the covenant which God had made with Noah, forgot that God had commanded them to go forth in every direction and fill the earth with human beings, solemnly promising to protect and bless them, and took on themselves <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the very opposite--set up a kingdom of their own fashion, and herded together for selfish safety, instead of going forth to all the quarters of the world in a natural way, according to their families, in their tribes, after their nations, as the eleventh chapter of Genesis says <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>done.</b> [...] "Let us build us a city and a tower, and make us a name, lest," [...] they said, [...] "we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole world." [...] Here was one act of disobedience to God's order. But besides this they had fallen into a slavish dread of the powers of nature--they were afraid of another flood. They set to to build a tower, on which they might worship the sun and stars, and the host of heaven, and pray to them to send no more floods and tempests. They thus fell into a slavish fear of the powers of nature, as well as into a selfish and artificial civilisation. In short, they utterly broke the covenant which God had made with Noah. But by miraculously confounding their language, God drove them forth over the face of the whole earth, and so forced them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that which <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>done</b> willingly at first.|$|R

The reason why the Germans did not break through to Paris, as by all the laws of strategy <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>done,</b> was the heroism of the Fifth Army and its utter refusal to break. They fought a rearguard action, contesting every village, field and, on occasion, yard ...
