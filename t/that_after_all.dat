5|$|Mr. Steinitz stands {{high as a}} {{theoretician}} and as a writer; he has {{a powerful}} pen, and when he chooses can use expressive English. He evidently strives {{to be fair to}} friends and foes alike, but appears sometimes to fail to see <b>that</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> he is much like many others in this respect. Possessed of a fine intellect, and extremely fond of the game, he is apt to lose sight of all other considerations, people and business alike. Chess is his very life and soul, the one thing for which he lives.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after hearing}} the verdict Matsui confided to his prison chaplain, Shinsho Hanayama, his {{feelings}} about the atrocities in Nanking and the rebuke he delivered to his subordinates on February 7, 1938. He blamed the atrocities on the alleged moral decline of the Japanese Army since the Russo-Japanese War, and said,The Nanking Incident was a terrible disgrace... Immediately after the memorial services, I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief... I told them <b>that</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> our efforts to enhance the Imperial prestige, everything had been lost in one moment through the brutalities of the soldiers. And can you imagine it, even after that, these officers laughed at me... I am really, therefore, quite happy that I, at least, should have ended this way, {{in the sense that}} it may serve to urge self-reflection on many more members of the military of that time.On the night of December 22, 1948, Matsui met fellow condemned inmates Hideki Tojo, Akira Mutō, and Kenji Doihara at the prison chapel. As the oldest member of the group, Matsui was asked to lead them in shouting three cheers of banzai to the Emperor. Then he led the group up to the gallows where they were all hanged simultaneously shortly after midnight on the morning of December 23, 1948.|$|E

25|$|The stage from Luchon to Carcassonne in 1962 set off 10 {{minutes later}} than {{scheduled}} because the German rider, Hans Junkermann, had been ill {{most of the}} night.

25|$|But for me {{that saying}} of Pittacus doesn’t ring true either (even {{if he was a}} smart man): he says “being good is hard.” For me, a man's good enough as long as he's not lawless, and if he has the common {{sense of right and wrong}} that does a city good—a decent guy. I {{certainly}} won’t find fault with a man like <b>that.</b> <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> there’s an endless supply of stupid fools. The way I see it, if there’s no great shame in it, it's all right.|$|E
25|$|In May, the Dutch {{agreed to}} support Pakubuwana II after {{considering}} <b>that</b> <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> the regencies in eastern interior were still loyal to this weak king but the Javano-Chinese rebel alliance had occupied the only road from Semarang to Kartasura and captured Salatiga. The princes in Mataram tried {{to attack the}} Javano-Chinese alliance but they were repulsed. On 30 June 1742, the rebels captured Kartasura and van Hohendorff had {{to run away from}} a hole in kraton wall with the helpless Pakubuwana II on his back. The Dutch, however, ignored Kartasura’s fate in rebel hands and concentrated its forces under Captain Gerrit mother and Nathaniel Steinmets to repulse the rebels around Demak, Welahan, Jepara, Kudus and Rembang. By October 1742, the northern coast of Central Java was cleaned of the rebels, who seemed to disperse into the traditional rebel hideout in Malang to the east and the Dutch forces returned to Semarang in November. Cakraningrat IV, who wished to free the eastern coast of Java from Mataram influence, could not deter the Dutch from supporting Pakubuwana II but he managed to capture and plunder Kartasura in November 1742. In December 1742, VOC negotiated with Cakraningrat and managed to persuade him to relieve Kartasura of Madurese and Balinese troops under his pay. The treasures, however, remained in Cakraningrat’s hand.|$|E

500|$|Having {{observed}} {{the workings of}} what he thought an alarming tendency of the poetic imagination, as well as Shakespeare's possible aristocratic bias, Hazlitt then observes <b>that,</b> <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> traits of Coriolanus's character emerge, even in this dramatic context, that Shakespeare clearly shows {{to be less than}} admirable. For example, [...] "Coriolanus complains of the fickleness of the people: yet, the instant he cannot gratify his pride and obstinacy at their expense, he turns his arms against his own country.

500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{publication}} of Burroughs' article, The Atlantic Monthly began receiving responses from readers. Among the many letters written in support for Burroughs' assertions was an article published in the Boston Evening Transcript in defense of Long's reputation as both a writer and a respected man of the cloth. Written by fellow clergyman Charles Prescott Daniels, the article, which was titled [...] "Discord in the Forest: John Burroughs vs. William J. Long", suggested that Burroughs left [...] "the reader with a kinder feeling for Mr. Long than for Mr. Burroughs, and [...] him, too, with a suspicion <b>that,</b> <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> the beasts and birds will forgive Mr. Long for having so amiably misrepresented them." ...|$|E

500|$|Palmetto Leaves was not Stowe's first travel memoir. In 1854 she {{published}} Sunny Memoirs of Foreign Lands {{about her}} {{first trip to}} Europe, a book unique as an American woman's view of Europe. She followed this with Agnes of Sorrento that appeared as a serial in The Atlantic Monthly from 1861 to 1862. Source material for Agnes of Sorrento was culled from her observations of and experiences in Italy, collected during her third trip to Europe, which she took with her family. Olav Thulesius, author of Harriet Beecher Stowe in Florida, recognizes Stowe's tendency to spin everything she saw into something selectively positive. Stowe addressed this in the foreword to Sunny Memoirs of Foreign Lands, writing: If the criticism be made that every thing is given couleur de rose, the answer is, Why not? If there be characters and scenes that seem drawn with too bright a pencil, the reader will consider <b>that,</b> <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> there are many worse sins than disposition to think and speak well of one's neighbors.|$|E
500|$|The Atlus {{version was}} {{directed}} by Kouji Okada, while the scenario's original elements were written by Kazunari Suzuki. Sprite and promotional artwork was designed by Esaki Minoru, and the music was composed by Tsukasa Masuko. During the early phases, the gameplay concept was a near-copy of the gameplay style of the Wizardry series, attributed by Suzuki to their superiors being fans of the series. Suzuki insisted on the inclusion of some new feature which would distinguish it from Wizardry. This resulted {{in the creation of}} the demon negotiation system. Okada later stated that demon negotiation was decided upon from an early stage. Speaking later about the first-person exploration, Okada was highly critical, feeling <b>that</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> their efforts [...] "All we had left after everything was said and done were lots and lots of long, winding dungeons!". Storage space on the cartridge was a recurring concern for the team, with Suzuki using unspecified programming tricks to include high-quality sprite graphics. Due to the rules of the gaming industry at the time, the teams and studios either went uncredited or had pseudonyms, with Masuko being credited as [...] "Project Satan".|$|E
500|$|Nagy {{realized}} she would [...] "pass {{time in a}} different way" [...] to the novel, eliminating elements that were unnecessary and slowed down {{the story in the}} screenplay. She had [...] "great freedom" [...] developing the screenplay in England while no studio or director was attached and it was just her and the producer. Over the years, five [...] "proper" [...] drafts of the screenplay materialized. Nagy said <b>that</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> the previous collaborations on the script, [...] "working for Todd was easy and quick. We both have an interest in restraint." [...] Haynes and Nagy collaborated on honing the screenplay. When Haynes came on board they had discussions about [...] "what became the framing device"; the story reminded Haynes of the 1945 classic film Brief Encounter and he proposed a framing device {{similar to that of the}} classic film, which Nagy [...] "then ran with in a certain way". [...] "He was interested in the same things, tonally, that the script was interested in – which isn't always the case", she noted. [...] "We were able to keep that restraint going". Working with Haynes, Nagy made the story more enigmatic, pruning some of the backstory in light of a significant line that Carol says to Therese early in the film: [...] "What a strange girl you are, flung out of space." [...] Nagy and Haynes were comparably determined not to make [...] "an agenda film" [...] or a [...] "look how far we've come" [...] film.|$|E
