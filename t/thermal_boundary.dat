5|$|In 1962, Kestin and Persen {{published}} a paper describing solutions for heat transfer when the <b>thermal</b> <b>boundary</b> layer is contained entirely within the momentum layer and for various wall temperature distributions. For {{the problem of}} a flat plate with a temperature jump at , they propose a substitution that reduces the parabolic thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation. The solution to this equation, the temperature {{at any point in}} the fluid, can be expressed as an incomplete gamma function. Schlichting proposed an equivalent substitution that reduces the thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation whose solution is the same incomplete gamma function.|$|E
5|$|Laminar {{boundary}} layers can be loosely classified {{according to}} their structure and {{the circumstances under which}} they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an oscillating body {{is an example of a}} Stokes boundary layer, while the Blasius boundary layer refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached flat plate held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and Falkner–Skan boundary layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a <b>thermal</b> <b>boundary</b> layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{intimate}} coupling between {{the movement of}} the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle (that is, the heat transfer caused by bulk movement of molecules within fluids). Thus, oceanic plates and the adjoining mantle convection currents always move in the same direction — because the oceanic lithosphere is actually the rigid upper <b>thermal</b> <b>boundary</b> layer of the convecting mantle. This coupling between rigid plates moving {{on the surface of the}} Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics.|$|E

The study employs correlated density matrix theory and adapts the algorithm to deal with spin- and isospin-dependent correlations.

The decomposition permits to distinguish between statistical correlations and dynamic (direct) correlations. Together with the concept of renormalized fermions the formal results open the pathway to investigate the <b>thermal</b> <b>boundaries</b> of normal Fermi phases within correlated density matrix theory.

Hence we introduce a micro thermal sensor with superior features: excellent data repeatability, accuracy, compatibility, mass produce and reduced calibration efforts to measure thermal properties of bio-samples. We present two variants of the sensor: a single probe and a multi-probe; with the latter having promising innovative application in detecting <b>thermal</b> <b>boundaries</b> of tissues using their conductivities.

40|$|Suspended t-bar {{ceilings}} {{are common}} in commercial buildings. Research has found that these ceilings are very leaky, and several problems arise from this. If the space above the ceiling is vented to outdoors, the entire building becomes leaky. Furthermore, if the insulation {{is located at the}} ceiling rather than the roof, then the ceiling space will be hot (summer), and if the ceiling space is also vented to outdoors, then the ceiling space will be hot and humid. The thermal and humidity conditions of the ceiling space have important implications for space conditioning loads, building ventilation rates, and indoor relative humidity. Conductive gains through ductwork add to loads, and various forms of uncontrolled air flow readily move air between the ceiling space and the occupied space. These factors should be considered during design and construction of commercial buildings. Best practice: locate the air and <b>thermal</b> <b>boundaries</b> of the building at the roof deck.
