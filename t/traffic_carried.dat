The freeway runs eastward through {{residential}} neighborhoods on the city's west side as it approaches the interchange with US131. This complex structure is adjacent to the Grand River north of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum. The carriageways for I-196 run through the interchange on different levels, with the eastbound <b>traffic</b> <b>carried</b> down near river level and the westbound lanes above the criss-crossing carriageways of US131's freeway. I-196 crosses the river {{on the opposite side of}} the interchange and both directions return to the same level. The freeway picks up an additional lane at this point as the median is replaced by a concrete barrier.|$|E
5|$|In 1830 the new railway {{opened and}} by the end of the year was {{carrying}} freight. Bradshaw immediately went into competition by lowering the rates of carriage on the canal and by offering improved terms to the private carriers. By so doing he managed to maintain the volume of <b>traffic</b> <b>carried</b> by the canal, both freight and passengers, at a time when the country was suffering a trade depression. However Bradshaw's tactics led to a sharp decline in profits. At the same time costs were rising, partly due to the use of steamboats on the Mersey. Further competition came with the opening of the Macclesfield Canal in 1831 which gave separate access to Manchester from the Midlands. In November 1831 Bradshaw suffered a stroke, as a result of which he lost the use of his left arm and leg, and there is evidence that it also impaired his judgement.|$|E
5|$|Free traders, {{independent}} of the Hudson's Bay Company and outside its jurisdiction, developed extensive commerce with the United States, making Saint Paul the principal entrepôt and link {{to the outside world}} for the Selkirk Settlement. The trade developed by and along the trails connecting Fort Garry with Saint Paul stimulated commerce, contributed to the settlement of Minnesota and North Dakota in the United States, and accelerated the settlement of Canada {{to the west of the}} rugged barrier known as the Canadian Shield. For a time, this cross-border trade even threatened Canada's control of its western territories. The threat diminished after completion of transcontinental trade routes both north and south of the border, and the transportation corridor through which the trails once ran declined in importance. That corridor has now seen a resurgence of <b>traffic,</b> <b>carried</b> by more modern means of transport than the crude ox carts that once travelled the Red River Trails.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the S was {{carrying}} {{only a handful}} of trains per day, and British Rail decided the cost of renewing the viaducts and tunnels would be prohibitively expensive, given the small amount of <b>traffic</b> <b>carried</b> on the line. In 1981 a protest group, the Friends of the Settle–Carlisle Line (FoSCL), was established, and campaigned against the line's closure even before it was officially announced.|$|E
25|$|At 6:00am on 3 March, Internet traffic {{effectively}} ceased, {{except for}} a very limited amount of <b>traffic</b> <b>carried</b> on satellite links, when the government severed the underwater backbone fiber-optic cable that runs along the coast and links networks in the east to servers in {{the west of the}} country.

25|$|The airline {{completed}} its decentralisation from CAAC when it gained independence on 10 October 1993. As such, the airline could {{from then on}} restructure itself into shareholding enterprises, independently arrange external financing and establish subsidiaries to complement its core enterprise. During the airline's early years, the carrier was the dominant domestic carrier. Together with the two major airlines of China– Air China and China Eastern– the airline handled half of passenger <b>traffic</b> <b>carried</b> by all Chinese carriers. Owing to Air China's status as the country's flag carrier, the airline is entitled to extensive international service rights, with China Eastern and China Southern's international networks confined to mainly East Asia and within Asia, respectively. Like other Chinese carriers, China Southern was subjected to CAAC's exclusive right to grant operating rights for every prospective route {{as well as to}} regulate domestic prices.|$|E
25|$|After {{the slow}} start, {{electric}} trams rapidly became very popular; by 1903, there were 300 electric tramcars in London, which carried 800,000 passengers over Whitsun weekend in 1903. The London County Council Tramways first electric line opened in May 1903 between Westminster Bridge and Tooting and the LCC sold 3.3 million tickets {{in its third}} year of business or five times the <b>traffic</b> <b>carried</b> by its horse trams. The LCC saw the electric trams {{as a way of}} driving social change, as its cheap, fast service could encourage workers {{to move out of the}} crowded inner city and live healthier lives in the suburbs. Although the City of London and the West End of London never gave permission for tram lines to be built, soon other London boroughs introduced their own electric services, including West Ham, Leyton, Dartford and Bexley.|$|E
25|$|Traffic {{steadily}} built up, although tolls were low, {{to offset}} the costs imposed on goods passing through Kingswood Junction to the Warwick and Birmingham Canal. On the southern section, coal was taken to Stratford, from where it was sold, or passed along the Upper Avon or the Stratford and Moreton Tramway. Modest dividends were paid to shareholders from 1824, and the total <b>traffic</b> <b>carried</b> in 1838 was 181,708 tons, on which profits of £6,835 were made. In 1845, the company agreed to sell the canal to the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway, who were also keen to purchase the Stratford and Moreton Tramway. It was not until January 1856 that the transaction was finally completed, and another year before the railway company took over day-to-day running. Another change of ownership occurred in 1863, when the railway company was absorbed by the Great Western Railway. Traffic gradually decreased, but the fall in receipts was faster than the fall in tonnage, as the railway took the long-distance loads.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, in 2007, {{fifteen years}} of {{investigation}} led {{to the conclusion that}} the 1992 assassination of DINA Colonel Gerardo Huber was most probably related to various illegal arms <b>traffic</b> <b>carried</b> out, after Pinochet's resignation from power, by military circles very close to himself. Huber had been assassinated a short time before he was due to testify in the case concerning the 1991 illegal export of weapons to Croatian army. The deal involved 370 tons of weapons, sold to Croatia by Chile on 7 December 1991, when the former country was under a United Nations' embargo because of the support for Croatia war in Yugoslavia. In January 1992, the judge Hernán Correa de la Cerda wanted to hear Gerardo Huber in this case, but the latter may have been silenced to avoid implicating Pinochet in this new case—although the latter was not anymore President, he remained at the time Commander-in-Chief of the Army. Pinochet was at the center of this illegal arms trade, receiving money through various offshores and front companies, including the Banco Coutts International in Miami.|$|E
500|$|Between 1849 and 1851 the {{competition}} between the Trustees and the railway companies intensified. [...] Agreements and alliances were made and broken. [...] Their major opponents were the London and North Western Railway and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway who reduced tariffs and took business away from the canals. [...] For {{the first time the}} railways carried more trade between Liverpool and the towns of central Lancashire than the canals. [...] The value of the <b>traffic</b> <b>carried</b> by the Bridgewater Canal in 1851 was the lowest in the time it was administered by the Trustees. [...] In 1851 the Earl of Ellesmere hosted a visit to Manchester by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. [...] They stayed at Worsley Hall, {{with a view of the}} canal, and were given a trip between Patricroft railway station and Worsley Hall, on state barges. [...] Large crowds had gathered to cheer the royal party, which apparently frightened the horses drawing the barge so much that they fell into the canal.|$|E
500|$|Wotton was a {{focal point}} of the line, and the site of the Tramway's forge and the stables for its horses. With a {{population}} {{at the time of the}} line's opening of 220, Wotton served a smaller populated area than Brill, but as the loading place for goods from Church Siding and the Kingswood branch it handled the majority of goods traffic. As much as 90 per cent of milk <b>traffic</b> <b>carried</b> by the Tramway was loaded at Wotton. The station was situated on a sharp curve and, had the extension to Oxford been built, it would have needed resiting to accommodate longer and faster trains. Wotton had the highest passenger numbers on the line other than Brill itself and the junction station at Quainton Road; in 1932 the station saw 2,648 passenger journeys earning a total of £144 (about £ in [...] ) in passenger receipts. Wotton station on the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway, which in 1923 had been taken over by the London and North Eastern Railway, remained open (albeit little used and served by only two trains per day in each direction) until 7 December 1953, when the line was abandoned. All buildings of the Tramway station at Wotton were subsequently demolished, other than a small building which had once housed the Tramway's forge, which was left derelict.|$|E

500|$|During {{the time}} the canal was {{administered}} by the Bridgewater Trustees, it made a profit every year. [...] Until his retirement in 1834, the administration was carried out entirely by Bradshaw. It has been calculated that the average annual profit between 1806 and 1826 was {{of the order of}} 13 per cent, and in 1824, the best year, it was 23 per cent. [...] Bradshaw found it difficult to delegate, and complained of being over-worked, but he was also regarded as being a [...] "formidable bargainer". In 1805 he was approached by the proprietors of the nearby Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal to resolve a dispute with a Salford landowner, but his response was delayed. In 1810 there was a general agreement with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company (M) to simultaneously raise freight charges. However any cooperation between the two companies was short-lived and by 1812 the Mersey and Irwell had reduced their charges. Further competition was to come from other carriers who used the canal; in 1824 the <b>traffic</b> <b>carried</b> by private companies exceeded that carried by the Trustees for the first time. However, in time more profit came from [...] "tonnage traffic" [...] (that carried by private companies) than from the Bridgewater's own carriage of freight. Bradshaw's administration saw increased deterioration of the fabric of the canal, the locks, docks and warehouses. The undertakings were starved of capital largely owing to inadequate provision for it in the duke's will. There were also problems caused by silting around the entrance to the Mersey and by the changing channels of the river itself.|$|E
500|$|The next {{significant}} advance was in 1630, {{when the}} Dutch Engineer Cornelius Vermuyden was {{employed by the}} Earl of Bedford and others to drain the Fens. [...] The Old Bedford River was cut from Earith to Salters Lode, a distance of , and provided sufficient drainage that the land {{could be used for}} summer grazing. Vermuyden published a document in 1642, entitled Discourse touching the draining of the Great Fennes, in which he proposed the division of the fens into three zones, the North Level, the South Level, and between them, the Middle Level, stretching from Morton's Leam to the Bedford River. An Act of Parliament, the Pretended Act, was obtained in 1649, and work began under his supervision. The New Bedford River was constructed, running parallel to the Old, and the Middle Levels area was protected. [...] The Forty Foot, Twenty Foot and Sixteen Foot Rivers were cut soon afterwards, to drain water from the area to Salters Lode and Welches Dam. In addition to these new channels, the Middle Level also contained [...] of the old course of the Nene, and the ancient artificial waterways of King's Dyke and Whittlesey Dyke, which connect Stanground to Floods Ferry. To the north is Well Creek, most of which was a natural waterway, although the final section to Salters Lode Lock follows the course of the New Podyke, a drainage channel constructed in the early sixteenth century. The primary function of the waterways was drainage, but water levels were managed to enable them to be navigated. The volumes of <b>traffic</b> <b>carried</b> are not well documented, especially in the early period.|$|E

The American War of Independence broke out during Young's time in command, and he was tasked with using his small naval force to interdict the supply of arms and gunpowder to rebel forces, and to defend British trade from American privateers and warships. He struggled to combat the delivery of weapons to the Americans. His squadron had too few fast cruisers, and the Americans were being openly supplied from the neutral Caribbean possessions, from the Dutch-held St Eustatius and the French at Martinique. Frustrated, Young himself denounced the [...] "very pernicious <b>traffic</b> <b>carried</b> on between his Britannic majesty's rebellious subjects ... and ... St. Eustatias." [...] He was more successful though in ensuring British commerce remained secure, organizing convoy systems by mid-1776 to escort merchant ships to Britain, and cruising with some success against American privateers and warships. His squadron captured 205 American merchant ships and captured or destroyed seventeen American privateers and warships.|$|E

2500|$|The Tokanui Branch {{was largely}} served by mixed trains that carried both {{passengers}} and freight. [...] Upon opening, {{the first section}} to Waimatua was served by just two mixed trains from Invercargill per week, but when the line was opened to Waimahaka, services changed to a daily mixed train that ran from the terminus to Invercargill and back. [...] These trains were changed to run from Tokanui when it was reached by the line. [...] Initially, timber was the major <b>traffic</b> <b>carried</b> on the branch, but as farming areas developed, the main traffic became agricultural lime and fertiliser in and produce of the farms out.

[...] The railway, in turn, was negatively impacted by the development of road transport in the region. [...] The line was losing money by 1930 but no alterations to improve efficiency and profitability were made to the schedule until 1951, when the mixed service was cut to just once weekly. [...] At this stage, it mainly operated for the benefit of families employed by the Railways Department. [...] The daily freight continued to run on the other days of the week sans passenger wagon. [...] Steam locomotives of the A class were the predominant form of motive power and they occasionally double-headed services during busy periods.|$|E
