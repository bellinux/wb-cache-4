5|$|During the Reagan years, Kemp and his {{followers}} ignored budget balancing while promoting <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> and economic growth. These <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> have been credited by conservatives for the economic growth from 1983 to 1990, which by 1996 {{had become one of}} the longest expansions in American history. Kemp notes that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's success at stemming inflation and the favorable regulatory environment were also major factors. Detractors note that the expansion was fueled by undesirable sectors like gaming, prisons, medical treatment, and credit card use.|$|E
5|$|As {{president}} of the NCC from 1998 to 2002, Harper launched an ultimately unsuccessful legal battle against federal election laws restricting third-party advertising. He led the NCC in several campaigns against the Canadian Wheat Board, and supported Finance Minister Paul Martin's 2000 <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> as a positive first step toward tax reform.|$|E
5|$|In 1995 he was {{the only}} Republican to vote to limit <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> to {{individuals}} with incomes of less than one million dollars. He voted against CAFTA. Specter also supported an increase in the federal minimum wage. He was a leading supporter of the U.S. Public Service Academy.|$|E
40|$|We {{test whether}} {{dividend}} taxes affect corporate investments. We exploit Sweden's 2006 dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> of 10 percentage points for closely held corporations and five percentage points for widely held corporations. Using rich administrative panel data and triple-difference estimators, {{we find that}} this dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> affects allocation of corporate investment. Cashconstrained firms increase investment after the dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> relative to cash-rich firms. Reallocation is stronger among closely held firms that experience a larger <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> This result is explained by higher nominal equity in cash-constrained firms and by higher dividends in cash-rich firms after the <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> The heterogeneous investment responses imply that the dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> raises efficiency by improving allocation of investment...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of the May 2003 {{dividend}} <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> and managerial stock holdings on corporate dividend initiation. We find that executives who hold sizable stakes in their companies become more likely to initiate dividends following this <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> The firms that initiate dividends after the <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> are more profitable than firms that initiate dividends before the <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> The market appears to recognize the managers' incentive change after the tax law change. Firms with higher managerial stock holdings receive lower abnormal returns from announcing dividend initiation. Dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> Managerial stock holdings Dividend initiation...|$|R

5|$|In August, Clinton {{signed the}} Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15 million low-income families, made <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> {{available}} to 90percent of small businesses, and raised {{taxes on the}} wealthiest 1.2percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced {{over a number of}} years through the implementation of spending restraints.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{economic}} indicators, the Budget presented in August 1974 saw large increases in spending, especially in education. Treasury officials had advised {{a series of}} tax and fee increases, ranging from excise taxes {{to the cost of}} posting a letter; their advice was mostly rejected by Cabinet. The Budget was unsuccessful in dealing with the inflation and unemployment, and Whitlam introduced large <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> in November. He also announced additional spending to help the private sector.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{do not use}} {{the terms}} profit and loss to {{describe}} the net results of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during a year is either a surplus or a deficit. Since making a profit is not {{the purpose of a}} government, a significant surplus generally means a choice between <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> or spending increases. A significant deficit will result in spending cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|E
40|$|A {{capital income}} <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> must in general be financed by {{increasing}} other taxes, and thus will have redistributive effects. This paper studies analytically the redistribution implied by a capital income <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> in the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans neoclassical growth model when agents differ in wealth and human capital and markets are frictionless. A few parameters affect the efficiency benefits and redistributive costs of capital taxation, {{and determine the}} set of agents who {{are in favor of}} a capital income <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> For plausible parameter values, a majority would lose from the <b>tax</b> <b>cut,</b> i. e. high capital taxes may be politically sustainable...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{literature}} {{has estimated that}} the 2003 dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> caused a large increase in aggregate dividend payouts, which would imply that dividend taxation creates large efficiency costs relative {{to the amount of}} revenue raised. I document that dividend payouts by real estate investment trusts also rose sharply following the <b>tax</b> <b>cut,</b> even though REIT dividends did not qualify for the cut. Using REITs as a control group in a simple difference-in-differences framework produces small and statistically insignificant estimates of the effect of the <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> on aggregate dividend payouts. I further document that the ratio of dividend payouts to corporate earnings changed little after the <b>tax</b> <b>cut,</b> and that the ratio of dividend payouts to share repurchases fell dramatically. These facts suggest that contemporaneous increases in earnings and investor demand for payouts drove the observed increases in aggregate dividend payouts, with at most a modest role for the <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> Dividends; Taxation...|$|R
2500|$|Bush {{argued that}} such a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> would stimulate the economy and create jobs. In the end, five Senate Democrats crossed party lines to join Republicans in {{approving}} a $1.35 trillion <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> program [...] {{one of the largest}} in U.S. history.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to Roth, {{he has had}} numerous political allies. At times, he collaborated with Gingrich and Lott on deregulation and <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> collaborated with McCain and Phil Gramm on <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> and spending restraints, legislated with and campaigned for Joseph Lieberman, and fought poverty with James Pinkerton. Pete du Pont was a progressive conservative ally. After retiring from Congress and serving in the Cabinet, Kemp remained close to Gingrich, Lott, Weber, and Mack. Kemp {{was a member of}} the federal committee to promote Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a national holiday. As a progressive voter, he had civil rights leaders such as Benjamin Hooks, Andrew Young and Coretta Scott King and conservative black intellectuals like Glenn C. Loury and Robert L. Woodson as supporters and friends. He boasted of having Democratic friends such as William H. Gray III, Charles B. Rangel and Robert Garcia. Ken Blackwell was a Deputy Secretary under Kemp. During the Reagan presidency, when Kemp was able to effect tax cutting, a leading United States Senate tax-cutting proponent was Democrat Bill Bradley, a former basketball star. Several American football players have followed Kemp to Congress: Steve Largent, J. C. Watts, and Heath Shuler.|$|E
5|$|Ryan has an {{interest}} in political economics and has been a thought leader in Congress on issues of budget reform. He helped bring the issues of the national debt and the national deficit into the national policy debate. Ryan subscribes to supply-side economics. His positions on fiscal policy have included <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> cuts to entitlement programs, freezes on discretionary spending, the elimination of automatic inflation increases in calculating budget baselines, deregulation, and the privatization of social security, Medicare, Medicaid, and education.|$|E
5|$|A global {{financial}} crisis was triggered in 2008, {{beginning in the}} United States. The financial crisis of 2008 which continued into 2009, had {{a major impact on}} the Swedish economy. Reinfeldt's Government emphasized that a balanced budget was a priority, combined with income <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> to stimulate domestic production and commerce. The Cabinet received criticism for holding to hard in the public finances, with limited investments, and the support of Reinfeldt's policies dropped to one of the lowest ever seen for an incumbent Government.|$|E
40|$|The {{centerpiece}} of President Bush's <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> in 2003 {{was a sharp}} reduction in the individual dividend tax rate. The dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> was designed to spur investment and boost the stock market by increasing the after-tax return on corporate earnings, thus raising stock valuations. The <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> also reduced the tax bias against dividends to spur larger payouts to shareholders. That reduces the amount of discretionary cash available to executives and will likely {{reduce the number of}} Enron-style corporate financial scandals. This study examines the impact of the dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> after one year. We gathered data on dividend payouts before and after the 2003 <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> for all Standard & Poor's 500 companies. We found a highly positive response to the tax cut: Annual dividends paid by S&P 500 companies rose from $ 146 billion to $ 172 billion, an increase of $ 26 billion. In addition, special dividends of $ 7 billion have been paid, raising the total first-year dividend increase to $ 33 billion. Thus, dividends increased 18 percent without special dividends and 23 percent with special dividends. Twenty-two companies that did not previously pay dividends have initiated regular dividends. Equity values rose more than $ 2 trillion after the <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> The large and positive response to the dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut,</b> which is scheduled to expire at the end of 2008, suggests that Congress should make it permanent...|$|R

500|$|In December 2011, with a {{temporary}} payroll <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> set to expire {{at the end}} of the month, the Senate considered the Middle Class <b>Tax</b> <b>Cut</b> Act of 2011, which would extend the <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> for 113 million workers or families and fund the plan by a 3.25 percent surtax on incomes over $1 million. [...] Brown voted against proceeding to take up the bill (i.e., voted against cloture that would end the filibuster). [...] He announced that his opposition was to the surtax on high incomes.|$|R
5|$|As the Parliament {{buildings}} {{had been}} lent to the Universal Postal Union for its 14th congress, Diefenbaker {{was forced to}} wait until the fall to convene Parliament. However, the Cabinet approved measures that summer, including increased price supports for butter and turkeys, and raises for federal employees. Once the 23rd Canadian Parliament was opened on October 14 by Queen Elizabeth II — the first to be opened by any Canadian monarch — the government rapidly passed legislation, including <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> and increases in old age pensions. The Liberals were ineffective in opposition, with the party {{in the midst of a}} leadership race after St. Laurent's resignation as party leader.|$|E
5|$|Atangana {{won over}} other chiefs and headmen through gifts, <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> flattery, and {{intervention}} on their behalf. He lavished attention on visitors {{from out of}} town, letting them stay at his palace and use his horses, and treating them to feasts. In addition to flattering them, this allowed him to monitor their activities and dealings with the colonial authorities. His clerk appointees in Jaunde informed him of the doings of both the Germans and his subjects. Atangana gained {{a substantial amount of}} wealth. He owned workshops and sold produce from five plantations to provision impressed railway construction workers.|$|E
5|$|By May 1997, Republican {{congressional leaders}} reached a {{compromise}} with Democrats and President Clinton {{on the federal}} budget. The agreement called for a federal spending plan designed to reduce the federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The plan included a total of $152billion in bipartisan <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> over five years. Other major parts of the spending plan called for $115billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the working poor, tax credits for college tuition, and a $2billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.|$|E

5|$|For {{his first}} term, Frank {{represented}} a {{district in the}} western and southern suburbs of Boston, anchored by Brookline and his hometown of Newton. However, in 1982, redistricting forced him to run against Republican Margaret Heckler, who represented a district centered on the South Coast, including Fall River and New Bedford. Although the newly configured district retained Frank’s district number—the 4th—it was geographically more Heckler's district. Frank focused on Heckler's initial support for President Ronald Reagan's <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> and won with 60% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Daniels {{proposed}} a property tax ceiling {{of one percent}} on residential properties, two percent for rental properties and three percent for businesses. The plan {{was approved by the}} Indiana General Assembly on March 14, 2008 and signed by Daniels on March 19, 2008. In 2008, Indiana homeowners had an average property tax cut of more than 30 percent; a total of $870 million in <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> Most money collected through property taxes funds local schools and county government. To offset the loss in revenues to the municipal bodies, the state raised the sales tax from 6% to 7% effective April 1, 2008.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} neoclassical growth model {{to examine the}} extent to which a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> pays for itself through higher {{economic}} growth. The model yields simple expressions for the steady-state feedback effect of a <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> The feedback is surprisingly large: for standard parameter values, half of a capital <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> is self-financing. The paper considers various generalizations of the basic model, including elastic labor supply departures from infinite horizons, and non-neoclassical production settings. It also examines how the steady-state results are modified when one considers the transition path to the steady state. ...|$|R
