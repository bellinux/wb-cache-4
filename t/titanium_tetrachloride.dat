The majority of such synthetic procedures rely on the hydrolysis of suitable precursors and often produce an amorphous solid, generally referred as the “amorphous” titanium oxide beside the crystalline titania. In this thesis, we thus set out to investigate amorphous materials produced by the hydrolysis of <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrachlorides</b> and tetraisopropoxide. We show that these amorphous products consists of titanium oxide hydrates, which are relatively stable at room temperature and fully convert into crystalline titania only after extended temperature treatments. We also find that titanium oxide hydrates may display highly desirable characteristic such as a strong photochromic response – especially when placed in a suitable chemical environment. In the following chapter, we then show 3 that hybrid systems can be readily prepared of titanium oxide hydrates with, for instance, macromolecular materials such as poly(vinylalcohol). The amorphous nature of the titanium oxide hydrates allows to introduce more than 90 vol. % of the inorganic species into such systems – compared to 15 vol. % or less when producing hybrids comprising, e. g., crystalline nanoparticles of TiO 2. Therefore, materials can be realized that display a refractive index n of at least 2. 1, without compromising transparency of the resulting structures. Remarkably, n can not only be adjusted by varying the content of the inorganic species, but also through suitable heat treatments and/or irradiation with UV-light. Potential applications for such new, versatile and tunable optical systems are also discussed in this thesis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTiO 2 powders {{have been}} {{successfully}} synthesized by atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ), which operates by feeding air between two coaxial electrodes that are driven by a 20. 8 kHz power source. <b>Tetrachloride</b> <b>titanium</b> is mixed with the effluent of the plasma jet in deferent regions to produce TiO 2 powders. The synthesized samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The chlorine contents in the TiO 2 powders were determined by the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Photocatalytic activities of samples were measured by FT-IR spectroscopy based on the destruction of stearic acid layers. And the effects of post-discharge plasma and deposition parameters were studied {{with respect to the}} morphology of TiO 2 powders. The results show that crystallized TiO 2 anatase structure can be obtained at the temperature ranged from 150 °C to 250 °C...|$|R
5|$|Hazards {{posed by}} <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> {{generally}} {{arise from the}} release of hydrogen chloride (HCl). TiCl4 is a strong Lewis acid, exothermically forming adducts with even weak bases such as THF and explosively with water, releasing HCl.|$|E
5|$|The most {{noteworthy}} {{reaction of}} TiCl4 is its easy hydrolysis, signaled by {{the release of}} hydrogen chloride {{and the formation of}} titanium oxides and oxychlorides, as described above for the production of TiO2. <b>Titanium</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> has been used to create naval smokescreens. The hydrogen chloride immediately absorbs water to form an aerosol of hydrochloric acid that efficiently scatter light. In addition, the highly refractive titanium dioxide is also an efficient light scatterer. This smoke is however corrosive.|$|E
5|$|<b>Titanium</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> (titanium(IV) chloride, TiCl4) is a colorless {{volatile}} liquid (commercial {{samples are}} yellowish) that, in air, hydrolyzes with spectacular emission of white clouds. Via the Kroll process, TiCl4 {{is produced in}} the conversion of titanium ores to titanium dioxide, e.g., for use in white paint. It is widely used in organic chemistry as a Lewis acid, for example in the Mukaiyama aldol condensation. In the van Arkel process, titanium tetraiodide (TiI4) is generated {{in the production of}} high purity titanium metal.|$|E
5|$|Titanium was {{discovered}} in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791, and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth for the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of mineral deposits, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere, and it is found in almost all living things, water bodies, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular photocatalyst and {{is used in the}} manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene.|$|E
5|$|The {{currently}} known {{processes for}} extracting titanium from its various ores are laborious and costly; {{it is not}} possible to reduce the ore by heating with carbon (as in iron smelting) because titanium combines with the carbon to produce titanium carbide. Pure metallic titanium (99.9%) was first prepared in 1910 by Matthew A. Hunter at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute by heating TiCl4 with sodium at 700–800°C under great pressure in a batch process known as the Hunter process. Titanium metal was not used outside the laboratory until 1932 when William Justin Kroll proved that it can be produced by reducing <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> (TiCl4) with calcium. Eight years later he refined this process with magnesium and even sodium in what became known as the Kroll process. Although research continues into more efficient and cheaper processes (e.g., FFC Cambridge, Armstrong), the Kroll process is still used for commercial production.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{more easily}} {{synthesized}} from <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrachloride,</b> but this product is typically less pure than that obtained from the elements.|$|E
25|$|Rutile is {{the second}} most {{abundant}} mineral sand. Rutile found in primary rock cannot be extracted hence the deposits containing rutile sand can be mined meaning a reduced availability to the high concentration ore. Crude titanium dioxide (in the form of rutile or synthetic rutile) is purified via converting to <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> in the chloride process. In this process, the crude ore (containing at least 70% TiO2) is reduced with carbon, oxidized with chlorine to give titanium tetrachloride; i.e., carbothermal chlorination. This <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> is distilled, and re-oxidized in a pure oxygen flame or plasma at 1500–2000K to give pure titanium dioxide while also regenerating chlorine. Aluminium chloride is often added to the process as a rutile promotor; the product is mostly anatase in its absence. The preferred raw material for the chloride process is natural rutile because of its high titanium dioxide content.|$|E
25|$|The Mukaiyama aldol {{reaction}} is the nucleophilic addition of silyl enol ethers to aldehydes catalyzed by a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride (as boron trifluoride etherate) or <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrachloride.</b> The Mukaiyama aldol reaction {{does not follow}} the Zimmerman-Traxler model. Carreira has described particularly useful asymmetric methodology with silyl ketene acetals, noteworthy for its high levels of enantioselectivity and wide substrate scope.|$|E
25|$|Isopropyl {{alcohol is}} esterified to give {{isopropyl}} acetate, another solvent. It reacts with carbon disulfide and sodium hydroxide to give sodium isopropylxanthate, an herbicide and an ore flotation reagent. Isopropyl alcohol reacts with <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> and aluminium metal to give titanium and aluminium isopropoxides, respectively, the former a catalyst, {{and the latter}} a chemical reagent. This compound {{may serve as a}} chemical reagent in itself, by acting as a dihydrogen donor in transfer hydrogenation.|$|E
500|$|<b>Titanium</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula TiCl4. It {{is an important}} intermediate {{in the production of}} titanium metal and the pigment titanium dioxide. TiCl4 is an unusual example of a metal halide that is highly volatile. Upon contact with humid air, it forms spectacular opaque clouds of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and hydrogen chloride (HCl). It is sometimes referred to as [...] "tickle" [...] due to the phonetic resemblance of its molecular formula (TiCl4) to the word.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} three {{chemical}} spills on SR11. The first one happened on November 30, 1984. A tanker truck leaked <b>Titanium</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> at the I-80/SR11 interchange at Girard. About 200 residents who lived near the highway were evacuated. No injuries were reported, and the chemicals were soon contained. A spill was reported on July 7, 1996. A tanker truck spilled methyl alcohol onto SR11 northbound, in Fairfield Township. The spill was contained, and charges were filed against the driver. The third and most recent one, happened on September 9, 2003. A tanker spilled [...] of a flammable solvent between SR344 and SR154. There were no evacuations.|$|E

2500|$|Aluminium hydride {{has been}} shown to add to {{propargylic}} alcohols. [...] Used together with <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrachloride,</b> aluminium hydride can add across double bonds. [...] Hydroboration is a similar reaction.|$|E
2500|$|More {{specialized}} morphologies - nanotubes, nanoclusters, whiskers, nanodisks, thin films, fullerenes - {{are prepared}} {{by combining the}} standard reagents, often TiCl4 in unusual ways. [...] For example, flower-like morphologies were obtain by treating a solution of sulfur in 1-octadecene with <b>titanium</b> <b>tetrachloride.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Glass {{containers}} typically receive two surface coatings, {{one at the}} hot end, {{just before}} annealing and one at the cold end just after annealing. At the hot end a very thin layer [...] of tin(IV) oxide is applied either using a safe organic compound or inorganic stannic chloride. Tin based systems {{are not the only}} ones used, although the most popular. <b>Titanium</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> or organo titanates can also be used. In all cases the coating renders the surface of the glass more adhesive to the cold end coating. At the cold end a layer of typically, polyethylene wax, is applied via a water based emulsion. This makes the glass slippery, protecting it from scratching and stopping containers from sticking together when they are moved on a conveyor. The resultant invisible combined coating gives a virtually unscratchable surface to the glass. Due to reduction of in-service surface damage, the coatings often are described as strengtheners, however a more correct definition might be strength-retaining coatings.|$|E
