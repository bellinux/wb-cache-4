5|$|After Virginia Tech went three-and-out, the Hokies punted to Florida State, who {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> {{the remaining}} seconds on the clock. The first half ended with Florida State leading, 103.|$|E

5|$|After {{the ball}} {{rolled into the}} end zone for a touchback, Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Bryan Randall {{completed}} an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the extra point cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick {{in order to have a}} chance to get another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would be free <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> the clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.|$|E

5|$|During his career, {{and most}} notably {{during his time}} in Baltimore, {{he was known to}} always have his dog, an Irish setter named Kelly, and had him sit in the players' area. It is claimed that the players never minded much, as he was very well-behaved and never left the area <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> on the field or made very much noise.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the debacle}} of The Road Back, Charles Rogers {{tried to get}} out of his {{contract}} with Whale; Whale refused. Rogers then assigned him to a string of B movies <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> his contractual obligation. Whale only made one additional successful feature film, The Man in the Iron Mask (1939), before retiring from the film industry in 1941.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} Louisville's kickoff, Virginia Tech elected <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> {{the clock}} and bring the first half to an end. During the process, Marcus Vick ran the ball on a designed play and was tackled by Cardinals defensive end Elvis Dumervil after Vick gained nine yards. Following the play, Vick paused, then stomped on Dumervil's leg. Though referees failed to observe the stomp, television commentators replayed the action, and Tech coaches considered pulling Vick from the game as punishment. At {{the end of the}} first half of play, Louisville held a 17–10 lead.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, the United States National Helium Reserve {{accounted}} for 30 {{percent of the}} world's helium. The reserve was expected <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of helium in 2018. Despite that, a proposed bill in the United States Senate would allow the reserve to continue to sell the gas. Other large reserves were in the Hugoton in Kansas, United States, and nearby gas fields of Kansas and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. New helium plants were {{scheduled to open in}} 2012 in Qatar, Russia, and the US state of Wyoming, but they were not expected to ease the shortage.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{sketches}} were derived almost exclusively from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily adaptable {{to the screen}} either as raw material or creative inspiration. In later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out,</b> concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E
25|$|England's bowlers {{performed}} {{well on the}} final day, and took 5 wickets in the first session ensuring the 323 run target was well out of Pakistan's reach. The <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of Mohammad Yousuf for a single figure score was a key moment in the innings – in fact, Pakistan lost 3 of their top order batsmen <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>outs</b> during the game. Sajid Mahmood struck twice in an over shortly before lunch to remove Faisal Iqbal and Kamran Akmal, and {{would go on to}} record test best figures of 4/22.|$|R

5|$|California {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 35-yard line following the post-touchdown kickoff and a short return. The Bears began <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> the clock, rushing the ball more than passing it, as had been the trend throughout the game. Though Aaron Rodgers completed four passes during the drive for 38yards, J. J. Arrington and Vincent Strang rushed the ball a total of eight times during the possession. California ran 7:09 off the clock before Vincent Strang broke free for a 13-yard rush {{that resulted in a}} touchdown. The score restored California's 14-point lead, making the game 49–35 with 6:26 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the kickoff}} and return, backup Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller entered {{the game to}} guide the Hokies' offense. The first play of the drive, however, was a run by backup running back Ken Oxendine, who gained five yards. Two more runs by Oxendine failed to gain a first down, however, and Virginia Tech punted. Tennessee's Sean Summers {{returned}} the kick to the Volunteers' 40-yard line, and the Volunteers continued trying <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> the clock. Tennessee failed to gain a first down, and the resulting punt rolled {{into the end zone}} for a touchback.|$|E
5|$|Having {{recovered}} the ball, and with Virginia Tech having no remaining timeouts {{and no way}} to stop the clock, Florida State was able <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> the remaining time in the game and secure a 2722 victory. Towards the end of the game, players on each team acted with hostility towards each other, and several received personal foul penalties. The penalties had no effect on the final outcome of the game, and Florida State won the ACC Championship Game and an automatic bid to the 2006 Orange Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Kaepernick {{took over}} on the Nevada 23-yard line with 4:01and made four {{completions}} {{to drive to the}} Terps' 15-yard line. Exploiting a large opening, Kaepernick held onto the ball and ran it into the end zone to narrow Maryland's lead to one touchdown, 42–35, with 2:19remaining. Jaekle attempted an onside kick in an effort to give Nevada another chance on offense, but the ball was recovered by Maryland receiver Danny Oquendo. Scott rushed for two and then 19yards. With the first down, Maryland had enough time <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> the clock and clinch the 42–35victory.|$|E
5|$|Mu Arae has a listed {{spectral}} type of G3IVV. The G3 part {{means the}} star {{is similar to the}} Sun (a G2V star).

This is reflected in its uncertain luminosity class, between IV (the subgiants) and V (main sequence dwarf star stars like the Sun).|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Humanitarian Bowl Most Valuable Player honors {{were awarded}} to Maryland running back Da'Rel Scott, who rushed for 174yards, and Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who threw for 370yards.

5|$|The free kick {{following}} the intentional safety {{was returned to}} near midfield, and Davis passed for a first down. Following the second down, Davis was sacked for a loss, but then scrambled for a first down to the Tech 25-yard line. From there, however, Boston College's offense began to struggle. During the four plays that followed, the Eagles were able to gain just one yard and turned the ball over on downs again. The final Boston College play was a sack of Davis, and Virginia Tech proceeded <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> the clock by kneeling on the ball after taking the field on offense.|$|E

One day, Yumemi begins to act strangely, {{culminating}} in her simply walking out and wandering around the town. The staff of the planetarium are bewildered, and one of the workers—a woman named Satomi Kurahashi—is ordered to go follow Yumemi and bring her back. Before long, Yumemi begins <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of battery power.|$|E
5|$|With just a {{few seconds}} {{remaining}} in the first half, there appeared to be little chance that Nebraska would have a chance to score. But Nebraska received the kickoff at its 24-yard line and returned it to the Nebraska 42. Frost attempted a long pass to get Nebraska into position for a field goal attempt, but the throw fell incomplete. Instead of trying another long pass, Nebraska proceeded <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> the clock, and the Cornhuskers went into halftime with a 1714 lead.|$|E
25|$|Both {{men were}} noted for their hitting ability and viewed attack as their most {{effective}} chance of survival. Regular boundaries and quickly-run singles took the score to 226, a seventh-wicket partnership of 134. Only seven runs were required with four wickets in hand as {{time was running}} short. Benaud hit a ball into the covers and the pair attempted a quick single when a direct hit from Joe Solomon saw Davidson <b>run</b> <b>out.</b> Australia needed six runs from the final over, in which Benaud was caught and the last two wickets fell <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>outs</b> while attempting the winning run.|$|R
