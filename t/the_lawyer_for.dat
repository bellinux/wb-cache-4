5|$|Zimmerman was <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>for</b> the Capon Valley Bank, {{headquartered}} in Wardensville, West Virginia, and provided his legal services {{to secure the}} bank's incorporation.

Following the outbreak of World WarI, Zimmerman registered for the draft during the registration for men aged 18 through 45 under the Selective Service Act of 1917. After the Winchester and Western Railroad Company received its charter on August 31, 1916, to build and operate a rail line connecting Wardensville and the Lost River valley of West Virginia to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Cumberland Valley Railroad at Winchester, Virginia, Zimmerman served as the company's secretary.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} Beatles' {{trip to the}} United States, merchandisers pitched many {{products}} to Epstein, including Beatles clocks, pens, cigarette lighters, plastic wigs, bracelets, games, etc., but he rejected them all. This was because he had already allowed David Jacobs, <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>for</b> NEMS, to give away 90 per cent of merchandising rights to one Nicky Byrne, in the UK. This was later deemed to be a disastrous mistake, as it left only 10 per cent for Epstein, NEMS and the Beatles. Byrne then took over Epstein's Stramsact merchandising in the UK and set up Seltaeb (Beatles spelled backwards), in the United States. While the Beatles were ensconced in the Plaza Hotel in New York, Epstein was further besieged by calls and visits from promoters, retailers, television commentators and hustlers.|$|E

25|$|His most salacious {{case was}} {{his defense of}} Jeff and Kathy Willets in 1991. The Willets were accused of {{operating}} a sex business out of their home. Rubin argued in their defense that Kathy Willets was driven to prostitution by nymphomania brought on by side-effects of the antidepressant, Prozac, forcing her to need sex {{with as many as}} eight men daily. Her husband, a deputy sheriff, was impotent and videotaped his wife's sex acts as a form of therapy.

25|$|In 1991, Manitoba Justice Minister James McCrae {{appointed}} Hughes to lead {{an investigation}} into the unusual circumstances which led to lawyer Harvey Pollock being arrested on a dubious sexual assault charge. Pollock had previously acted as <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>for</b> the family of J.J. Harper, an indigenous leader who had been killed in a confrontation with Winnipeg police. The case against Pollock quickly fell apart in court, and the woman whose statements led to the charge later clarified that she had never accused Pollock of sexual assault during her discussions with police. Pollock believed that he was the target of a police vendetta. Hughes' report completely vindicated Pollock and led to the resignation of police chief Herb Stephen.|$|E
25|$|Prosecutors in New York {{investigated}} the deliveries Benoit received from Signature Pharmacy and MedXLife.com, which sold steroids and {{human growth hormone}} (HGH) over the internet. Terence Kindlon, <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>for</b> MedXLife co-owner Dr. Gary Brandwein, denied allegations that his client's company sold steroids to Benoit. Brandwein {{pleaded not guilty to}} six counts in New York state court related to the criminal sale of a controlled substance. According to a report from Sports Illustrated, three packages sent to Benoit were from Signature Pharmacy with the first one sent in December 2005 to San Antonio, Texas. The second package was sent on February 13, 2006 to an address in Peachtree City, Georgia and the third package was sent in July 2006 to Fort Walton Beach, Florida. This followed eleven superstars that were announced in a Sports Illustrated steroids investigation that began March 2007, which included Kurt Angle, Eddie Guerrero, Oscar Gutierrez (Rey Mysterio, Jr.), Adam Copeland (Edge) and Gregory Helms, with Copeland receiving a high amount of steroids.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophy}} of anarchism {{was also a}} point of contention during the trial. Gordon Simmons, an adjunct professor of philosophy at West Virginia State University and Marshall University, testified as Sierra's final witness. His testimony included explanations of the philosophy espoused by Sierra's proposed club, its impact on American social and political movements, {{and the notion that}} anarchists had historically been unjustly persecuted in American courts, citing such examples as the trials of the Haymarket affair and Sacco and Vanzetti. <b>The</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>for</b> the school officials countered that anarchism had prominent ties to terrorism and assassination, and referred to Timothy McVeigh and Theodore Kaczynski as anarchists. On July 12, the court ruled that Sierra had been justly suspended and forbidden to wear the T-shirts, but had been improperly denied the right to start a club, and awarded her the $1 in damages she sought. Attorneys for both Kanawha County and Sierra asked that those parts of the verdict that went against their client, requesting that Kanawha Chief Circuit Judge James C. Stucky throw out the jury's verdict, finding it to be inconsistent, and that he rule himself instead.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday 6 July at 3:30am, 1,500 {{soldiers}} and riot police {{swept into the}} nationalist area in 100 armoured vehicles. They took control of Garvaghy Road {{so it would be}} free for the marchers. This led to clashes with about 300 protesters, who began a sit-down protest on the road. They were forcibly removed by riot police. Rosemary Nelson, <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>for</b> the residents coalition, was verbally and physically abused by officers. Some officers claimed that residents taunted them about the killing of their two colleagues in Lurgan while shouting IRA slogans. From this point onward, the road was sealed off by rows of armoured vehicles and residents were hemmed into their housing estates. As residents were unable to reach the Catholic , the local priests held an open-air mass in front of a line of {{soldiers and}} armoured personnel carriers. Ronnie Flanagan, the Chief Constable, said the march had been allowed to go ahead to avoid loyalist violence. The parade marched along Garvaghy Road at noon that day. After it passed, the security forces began withdrawing from the area and severe rioting erupted. They were attacked by hundreds of nationalists with stones, bricks and petrol bombs. About 40 plastic bullets were fired at rioters, and about 18 people had to be hospitalised.|$|E
25|$|One day, while Bennett was {{crossing}} the Miramichi River on the ferry boat, a well-dressed lad about nine years younger {{came over to}} him and struck up a conversation. This was the beginning of an improbable but important friendship with Max Aitken, later the industrialist and British press baron, Lord Beaverbrook. The agnostic Aitken liked to tease the Methodist Bennett, whose fiery temper contrasted with Aitken's ability to turn away wrath with a joke. This friendship would become important to his success later in life, as would his friendship with the Chatham lawyer, Lemuel J. Tweedie, a prominent Conservative politician. He began to study law with Tweedie on weekends and during summer holidays. Another important friendship was with the prominent Shirreff family of Chatham, the father being High Sheriff of Northumberland County for 25 years. The son, Harry, joined the E. B. Eddy Company, a large pulp and paper industrial concern, and was transferred to Halifax. His sister moved there to study nursing, and soon Bennett joined them to study law at Dalhousie University. Their friendship was renewed there, and became crucial to his later life when Jennie Shirreff married the head of the Eddy Company. She later made Bennett <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> <b>for</b> her extensive interests.|$|E
