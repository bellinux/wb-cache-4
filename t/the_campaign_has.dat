5|$|Beginning in 2011, it was {{designed}} as a push for the release of Xenoblade Chronicles, The Last Story and Pandora's Tower, three titles released late in the lifespan of the Wii. The campaign was acknowledged by Nintendo, and though announcing that they initially had no plans, all three titles were eventually released overseas. Reception of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>has</b> been favorable overall, and its perceived success when compared to similar earlier campaigns was also noted.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{overwhelming}} British victory in the climactic battle, <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>has</b> sometimes been considered a strategic success for France. Historian Edward Ingram noted that if Nelson had successfully intercepted Bonaparte at sea as ordered, the ensuing battle could have annihilated both the French fleet and the transports. As it was, Bonaparte was free to continue {{the war in the}} Middle East and later to return to Europe personally unscathed. The potential of a successful engagement at sea to change the course of history is underscored by the list of French army officers carried aboard the convoy who later formed the core of the generals and marshals under Emperor Napoleon. In addition to Bonaparte himself, Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Auguste de Marmont, Jean Lannes, Joachim Murat, Louis Desaix, Jean Reynier, Antoine-François Andréossy, Jean-Andoche Junot, Louis-Nicolas Davout and Dumas were all passengers on the cramped Mediterranean crossing.|$|E

25|$|That same year, a $1 billion {{comprehensive}} fundraising {{campaign was}} launched, the University's first-ever comprehensive campaign, {{with the primary}} focus on financial aid, faculty support, research, and facility improvements. In 2016 the campaign goal was reached. The Board of Trustees voted to raise the goal to $1.5 billion and extend through 2019.

40|$|In August 2010 the Costa Rican {{government}} {{implemented a}} comprehensive program to increase compliance with legal minimum wages, <b>the</b> <b>Campaign</b> for Minimum Wages. To evaluate the impact of <b>the</b> <b>Campaign,</b> we use a regression discontinuity approach, which compares what happened to workers who before <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>had</b> been earning below the minimum wage to those who before <b>the</b> <b>Campaign</b> <b>had</b> been earning above the minimum wage. We analyze a panel data set with information on workers from before <b>the</b> <b>Campaign</b> began (July 2010) and after <b>the</b> <b>Campaign</b> <b>had</b> been in operation for some time (July 2011). We find evidence that <b>the</b> <b>Campaign</b> led {{to an increase in}} compliance with minimum wage laws in Costa Rica; the mean earnings of those earning less than the minimum wage in 2010 increased by approximately 10 % more than the earnings of those who had been earning more than the minimum wage. <b>The</b> <b>Campaign</b> led to <b>the</b> largest increases in the wages of women, younger workers and less-educated workers. We find no evidence that <b>the</b> <b>Campaign</b> <b>had</b> a negative impact on the employment of full-time workers whose wages were increased. We find some weak evidence that <b>the</b> <b>Campaign</b> <b>had</b> a negative impact on the employment of part-time private sector employees. Although increased inspections were mainly targeting minimum wage violations, we also observe an increase in compliance with a broader set of labor standards and a positive spillover effect relative to other violations of labor laws...|$|R

25|$|Raising {{awareness}} {{about the problem of}} hunger mobilizes energy to find a solution. In 1997, FAO launched TeleFood, a campaign of concerts, sporting events and other activities to harness the power of media, celebrities and concerned citizens to help fight hunger.

25|$|One of {{the final}} Australian {{operations}} of the war occurred {{on the island of}} Borneo in mid-1945, just weeks before the Japanese capitulation. Although the necessity of <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>has</b> since been called into question, {{at the time it was}} felt that Borneo was strategically important due to its vast oil deposits, and numerous airfields and harbours which made it ideal as a springboard for operations in Malaya and Java which were planned for 1946 but which did not in the end eventuate.|$|E

In {{addition}} to tackling corruption, <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>has</b> also had the effect of reducing regional factionalism and dissecting entrenched patron-client networks that have flourished since the beginning of economic reforms in the 1980s. Xi Jinping had declared in his speeches that internal factionalism is as harmful to the party's ability to govern as corruption. As of November 2015, all 31 provincial-level divisions, including municipalities like Beijing and Shanghai, which were once considered to be relatively free of corruption, have seen at least one provincial-level official investigated for corruption.|$|E

The British made major efforts to deceive the Ottoman Army as to their actual intended target of operations. This effort was successful and the Ottoman Army was taken by surprise when the British suddenly attacked Megiddo. As the Ottoman troops started a full-scale retreat, the Royal Air Force bombed the fleeing columns of men from the air and within a week, the Ottoman army in Palestine ceased to exist as a military force.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, {{a number}} of {{universities}} across the UK, such as Oxford, Newcastle, Cambridge and others, held referenda {{on whether or not}} their student unions should leave the NUS. The grounds for this range from perceived anti-Semitism within the NUS, a lack of democracy within the NUS, not feeling represented by what many view as an overly politicised movement, and others. <b>The</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>has</b> been marred by allegations of cheating or breaking referendum rules by the NUS at various universities by allegations of racism, tokenism, and others by students campaigning both for and against disaffiliation. Despite this, prestigious universities such as Newcastle have left the NUS, with others such as Oxford and Cambridge voting to remain.|$|E
