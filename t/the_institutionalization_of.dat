40|$|The {{purpose of}} this case study is to {{describe}} the way power, as individual agency, works in <b>the</b> space <b>of</b> <b>institutionalization</b> <b>of</b> a new teacher mentoring program. <b>The</b> space <b>of</b> <b>institutionalization</b> is thought <b>of</b> as a space in which {{the design of the}} mentoring program and the actions of participants interact as the program undergoes changes. The participants in this study tell about the way each goes about mentoring in response to the program changes. Their stories are analyzed through critical discourse analysis for workings of power. Two kinds of power or agency emerge through the analysis. Instrumental agency is the physical activities, perceptions, and spoken words of the mentors limited by their subject and structural positionality. Instrumental agency in <b>the</b> space <b>of</b> <b>institutionalization</b> worked to instill differentiation as plurality and normalization as objectification into the mentoring program. When instrumental agency is the dominant power in <b>the</b> space <b>of</b> <b>institutionalization,</b> <b>the</b> legitimacy <b>of</b> the mentoring program is rationalized as legitimization. Legitimization of the program results in an ecology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> space <b>of</b> <b>institutionalization</b> open to vagaries of political expediency. The second kind of power or agency to emerge is operative agency. Operative agency originates in sensings and feelings as expressed in wondering and uncertainty about mentoring roles and the mentoring program. When engaging operative agency as power, differentiation and normalization in <b>the</b> space <b>of</b> <b>institutionalization</b> can be questioned...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>institutionalization</b> <b>of</b> science {{occurred}} {{throughout the}} 18th century.

Benjamin Franklin invested a town in Massachusetts with a collection of books that the town voted to make available to all free of charge, forming the first Public Library. Academie de Chirurgia (Paris) published Memoires pour les Chirurgiens, generally considered to be the first medical journal, in 1736. The American Philosophical Society, patterned on the Royal Society (London), was founded in Philadelphia in 1743. As numerous other scientific journals and societies were founded, Alois Senefelder developed the concept of lithography for use in mass printing work in Germany in 1796.|$|E
25|$|John G. Harries {{considered}} {{a common ground}} in the ideas that underlie developments in 20th-century art such as Serial art, Systems Art, Constructivism and Kinetic art. These kind of arts often do not stem directly from observations of things visible in the external natural environment, but from the observation of depicted shapes and {{of the relationship between}} them. Systems art, according to Harries, represents a deliberate attempt by artists to develop a more flexible frame of reference. A style in which its frame of reference is taken as a model to be emulated rather than as a cognitive systems, that only leads to <b>the</b> <b>institutionalization</b> <b>of</b> the imposed model. But to transfer the meaning of a picture to its location within a systemic structure does not remove the need to define the constitutive elements of the system: if they are not defined, one will not know how to build the system.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the efforts}} to {{preserve}} wildlife for tourism and as resources sparked the conservation movement, the true ideological development began with <b>the</b> <b>institutionalization</b> <b>of</b> environmental protection, which was brought forth {{through a number of}} dedicated government bureaucrats such as Robert Campbell, a Canadian Forestry Branch Director, Gordon Hewitt, a Dominion entomologist, and James Harkin, the first Parks Commissioner expressing strong conservationist philosophies. These bureaucrats actively sought administrative support from the government and intensively engaged in their own research to pass numerous environmental protection policies. Due to the efforts of Canadian government officials, the wildlife conservation movement became institutionalized and solidified. While personal experiences and encounters with environmental threats account for the efforts of these civil servants, the influence of American experience was a strong factor: the loss of the frontier, the impact of civilization with its resulting decline in wildlife numbers, and the establishment and success of American national parks. James Harkin was especially influenced by the American preservationist John Muir and his wildnerness preservation theories, while both Harkin and Douglas were well aware of the developments in American wildlife protection movements.|$|E

These served as the capitals of the Malla confederation of Nepal. These states competed {{with each other in}} the arts, architecture, aesthetics, and trade, resulting in tremendous development. The kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings, squares, and temples, as well as the development of waterspouts, <b>the</b> <b>institutionalization</b> <b>of</b> trusts (called guthis), the codification of laws, the writing of dramas, and the performance of plays in city squares.

Books have been found from this era that describe their tantric tradition (e.g. Tantrakhyan), medicine (e.g.Haramekhala), religion (e.g.Mooldevshashidev), law, morals, and history. Amarkosh, a Sanskrit-Nepal Bhasa dictionary from 1381 AD, was also found.

25|$|The {{construction}} of divergent ethnic “Tutsi” and “Hutu” identities was formulated during {{the era of}} European colonization from the late 1880s to the 1950s. German colonialism did little to alter the existing stratified social system. The Germans {{were not interested in}} disrupting social affairs – their sole concern was the efficient extraction of natural resources and trade of profitable cash crops. Colonial bureaucrats relied heavily on native Tutsi chiefs to maintain order over the Hutu lower classes and collect taxes. Thus, the German affirmation of the stratified social structure was utilized by the Tutsi aristocracy as justification for minority rule over the lower-class Hutu masses. Germany’s defeat in World War I allowed Belgian forces to conquer Rwanda. Belgian involvement in the region was far more intrusive than German administration. In an era of Social Darwinism, European anthropologists claimed to identify a distinct “Hamitic race” that was superior to native “Negroid” populations. Influenced by racialized attitudes, Belgian social scientists declared that the Tutsis, who wielded political control in Rwanda, must be descendants of the Hamites, who shared a purported closer blood line to Europeans. The Belgians concluded that the Tutsis and Hutus composed two fundamentally different ethno-racial groups. Thus, the Belgians viewed the Tutsis as more civilized, superior, but most importantly, more European than the Hutus. This perspective justified placing societal control {{in the hands of the}} Tutsis at the expense of the Hutus. Moreover, this Belgian affirmation of the Hamitic theory provided a conceptual foundation for Tutsis and Hutus to start identifying themselves as different ethnic groups. The Belgians established a comprehensive race theory that was to dictate Rwandan society until independence: Tutsi racial superiority and Hutu oppression. <b>The</b> <b>institutionalization</b> <b>of</b> Tutsi and Hutu ethnic divergence was accomplished through administrative, political economic, and educational means.|$|E

However, <b>the</b> <b>institutionalization</b> <b>of</b> sociology as an academic discipline was chiefly led by Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), who developed positivism as a foundation to practical social research. While Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality. Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux in 1895, publishing his Rules of the Sociological Method (1895). For Durkheim, sociology could be described as the [...] "science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning".|$|E
500|$|After the {{turbulent}} 1800 papal conclave, Pope Pius VII (1800–1823) shunned {{the institution of}} the cardinal-nephew and instead relied on his Cardinal Secretary of State, Ercole Consalvi. During the 19th century, the only nephew of a Pope created cardinal was Gabriele della Genga Sermattei, nephew of Pope Leo XII, created cardinal by Pope Gregory XVI on February 1, 1836. Although <b>the</b> <b>institutionalization</b> <b>of</b> nepotism disappeared in the 18th century, [...] "pietas" [...] (duty to family) remained a theme of papal administration into the 20th century, although rarely with the overt intervention of a papal uncle. Following the example of Pius VI, Popes Leo XIII (who elevated his brother, Giuseppe Pecci, cardinal on May 12, 1879) and Pius XII (1939–1958) weakened the formal curial bureaucracy in favor of a parallel government, in which family members often figured prominently. The loss of temporal power over the Papal States (de facto in 1870 with the [...] "Roman Question" [...] and de jure in 1929 with the Lateran Treaty) also eliminated the structural conditions which had figured prominently in the family politics of earlier Popes.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the origins}} of the modern private equity {{industry}} in 1946, there have been four major epochs marked by three boom and bust cycles. The early history of private equity—from 1946 through 1981—was characterized by relatively small volumes of private equity investment, rudimentary firm organizations and limited awareness of and familiarity with the private equity industry. The first boom and bust cycle, from 1982 through 1993, was characterized by the dramatic surge in leveraged buyout activity financed by junk bonds and culminating in the massive buyout of RJR Nabisco before the near collapse of the leveraged buyout industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s. [...] The second boom and bust cycle (from 1992 through 2002) emerged from the ashes of the savings and loan crisis, the insider trading scandals, the real estate market collapse and the recession of the early 1990s. [...] This period saw the emergence of more institutionalized private equity firms, ultimately culminating in the massive Dot-com bubble in 1999 and 2000. The third boom and bust cycle (from 2003 through 2007) came {{in the wake of the}} collapse of the Dot-com bubble—leveraged buyouts reach unparalleled size and <b>the</b> <b>institutionalization</b> <b>of</b> private equity firms is exemplified by the Blackstone Group's 2007 initial public offering.|$|E
