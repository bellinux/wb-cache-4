5|$|There {{are other}} {{mountain}} sheep on the Lakeland fells, notably Swaledales and Rough-Fells, but the hardy Herdwick is the sheep {{most likely to}} be seen in and around the Duddon valley, the Coniston fells, the Buttermere fells and, through Borrowdale or Wasdale, up to the highest land in England, the Scafells. More than the old drystone walls that quarter the fells, the packhorse bridges or the whitewashed farmsteads, the little grey Herdwick sheep <b>typify</b> the Lakeland.|$|E
5|$|Ruler 2 acceded to {{the throne}} of Toniná in 668. His rule is marked by warfare and the {{frequent}} depiction of bound captives on his monuments. Ruler 2 established the use of in-the-round sculptural style that came to <b>typify</b> the stelae of Toniná. A monument dated to 682 depicts three naked prisoners with their arms bound, {{one of them is}} identified as a lord from Annak', an as yet unidentified site. His reign may have ended with his defeat and capture by K'inich Kan Balam II of Palenque in September 687, as described in a glyphic text from Temple 17 in the rival city, an event that probably culminated in his sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Later, Gladwell compares Langan with Oppenheimer, {{the father}} of the atomic bomb. Noting that they <b>typify</b> innate natural {{abilities}} that should have helped them both succeed in life, Gladwell argues that Oppenheimer's upbringing made a pivotal difference in his life. Oppenheimer grew up in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Manhattan, {{was the son of a}} successful businessman and a painter, attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School on Central Park West, and was afforded a childhood of concerted cultivation. Outliers argues that these opportunities gave Oppenheimer the chance to develop the practical intelligence necessary for success. Gladwell then provides an anecdote: When Oppenheimer was a student at University of Cambridge he attempted to poison one of his tutors. He avoided punishment, and continued his studies by using the skills gained from his cultivated upbringing in his negotiation with the university's administrators, who had wanted to expel him.|$|E

25|$|It is {{cut by the}} basins and tributaries of two rivers: the Columbia and the Fraser.

25|$|None of the {{original}} Dutch colonial furniture owned by the Schencks {{is known to have}} survived.

25|$|The {{historic}} district also includes various utility buildings including a mess hall, meat house, transformer building, comfort station (later {{converted to a}} sign shop), warehouse, and machine shop.

25|$|In modern craniofacial anthropometry, Negroid {{describes}} {{features that}} <b>typify</b> skulls of black people.

Low-lying white buildings <b>typify</b> most of Muscat's urban landscape, while the port-district of Muttrah, with its corniche and harbour, form the north-eastern periphery of the city. Muscat's economy is dominated by trade, petroleum and porting.|$|E
25|$|The Tuscan hill town of Massa Marittima has two Romanesque civic {{buildings}} which <b>typify</b> {{the character}} of medieval architecture of Tuscany as against that found in the north. The Palazzo del Podestà and Palazzo del Comune of Massa Marittima represent a type of Romanesque civic building that continued in the Gothic style in other hill towns such as Volterra and reached its grandest expression in late the 13th-century Bargello and early 14th-century Palazzo Vecchio of Florence, and the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena.|$|E
25|$|Competition among EcM fungi is a {{well-documented}} case of soil microbial interactions. In many experimental cases, {{the timing}} of colonization between competing EcM fungi determined which species was dominant. Namely, there was a priority effect that significantly favored the original colonists {{to be the most}} dominant, except in cases involving fungal species at a natural competitive disadvantage. This disadvantage appears {{to be related to the}} proportion of root tips colonized, and those species incapable of colonizing a sufficient proportion of host roots do not <b>typify</b> this priority effect.|$|E

25|$|Though {{he died at}} the age of 32 or 33, Giorgione left {{a lasting}} legacy to be {{developed}} by Titian and 17th-century artists. Giorgione never subordinated line and colour to architecture, nor an artistic effect to a sentimental presentation. He was arguably the first Italian to paint landscapes with figures as movable pictures in their own frames with no devotional, allegorical, or historical purpose—and the first whose colours possessed that ardent, glowing, and melting intensity which was so soon to <b>typify</b> the work of all the Venetian School.|$|E
25|$|All {{documents}} and books {{relating to the}} expedition are of historical value, not only from a travel and discovery perspective but also from a cultural studies standpoint. The ethnocentric descriptions of aboriginal peoples in the places now known as British Columbia, Yukon Territory and Alaska, {{as well as the}} general region of Eastern Siberia, <b>typify</b> those attitudes of the time. Telegraph records provide evidence for native land claims such as those of the Gitxsan Nation of northern British Columbia. Dall's records have helped locate Smithsonian exhibits returned to their original native domiciles.|$|E
25|$|The 1873 games <b>typify</b> {{the loose}} {{manner in which}} {{statistics}} were compiled in those days. Grace's first-class batting aggregate for that season included his scores in the MCC matches against Hertfordshire and Staffordshire; and in the North v. South game at The Oval on 26 July. On the other hand, his bowling in the same matches was ignored. The match on 26 July {{was in fact a}} one-day filler that was played because the scheduled three-day North v. South match had finished a day early on 25 July. It is questionable if fillers have ever been regarded as major or first-class matches.|$|E
