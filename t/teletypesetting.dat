TTS required less skill than the complex linotype machines, and publishers wanted to automate to save money. ITU was not necessarily opposed to TTS—it trained its members on the new equipment—but wanted to control the rate at which automation occurred; assurances that TTS operators would be paid at the same rates as linotype workers; that at least a portion of the savings from publishers would go toward union pension plans (to allow funding to continue as the workforce and union membership declined) and guarantees that no printer would lose their job {{as a result of the}} new technology. Publishers were willing to protect jobs and reduce the workforce through attrition, but balked at what they viewed as [...] "tribute payments" [...] to the unions. After nearly a five-month strike, the unions and the publishers reached an agreement in March, 1963—in which the unions won a weekly worker wage and benefit increase of $12.63 and largely forestalled automation—the city's newspapers resumed publication on April 1, 1963.|$|E

50|$|The PDP-8 was {{designed}} {{in part to}} handle contemporary telecommunications and text. Six-bit character codes were in widespread use at the time, and the PDP-8's twelve-bit words could efficiently store two such characters. In addition, a six-bit teleprinter code called the <b>teletypesetting</b> or TTS code was in widespread use by the news wire services, and an early application for the PDP-8 was typesetting using this code. Later 7-bit ASCII and 8-bit UTF-8 character codes were developed in part {{as a response to}} the limitations of five- and six-bit character codes.|$|E

It was founded in 1981, under the name <b>TeleTypesetting</b> Company and it is based in Boston, Massachusetts. The company's product line includes automotive and commercial GPS navigation systems and other products including GPS receivers and tracking units. It develops and sells the WorldNav software for PC and Windows CE, tools for converting third party maps into WorldNav maps, an SDK and an API that allow the customization of the WorldNav application. TeleType Co. also offers consultancy services {{for those interested in}} acquiring and adapting the source code of their software products.|$|E
50|$|Early {{electronic}} typesetting {{programs were}} designed to drive phototypesetters, most notably the Graphic Systems CAT phototypesetter that troff was designed to provide input for. Though such programs still exist, their output is no longer targeted at any specific form of hardware.Some companies, such as <b>TeleTypesetting</b> Co. created software and hardware interfaces between personal computers like the Apple II and IBM PS/2 and phototypesetting machines which provided computers equipped with it the capability to connect to phototypesetting machines.With the start of desktop publishing software, Trout Computing in California introduced VepSet, which allows Xerox Ventura Publisher {{to be used as}} a front end and wrote a Compugraphic MCS disk with typesetting codes to reproduce the page layout.|$|E

50|$|Sensing {{that the}} {{electronics}} industry {{was in its}} infancy and poised to expand, the two founders established the company in 1981, initially operating in the phototypesetting industry. <b>TeleTypesetting</b> {{was one of the}} first companies to produce a hardware and software interface between personal computers such as the Apple II and IBM PS/2 and numerous models of phototypesetting machines such as the Compugraphic Compuwriter and CompEdit, and Varityper EPICS, Comp/Set and Comp/Edit.TeleTypesetting Co. created a package called MicroSetter, composed of a desk accessory, cables, conversion software, and connectivity software, which provided computers equipped with it the capability to connect to phototypesetting machines. MicroSetter was compatible with numerous desktop publishing applications such as Ready,Set,Go, Page Maker, Microsoft Word, MacWrite, and MacDraw.Use of personal computers took advantage of functions such as spell checking and printing on plain paper prior to printing on expensive phototypesetting paper which could not easily be corrected after the photographic process was completed thereby saving time and expense while providing more accurate results.From the MicroSetter product line evolved the T-Script PostScript interpreter (also referred to in the industry as a Raster image processor) which converted output from popular PostScript based WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) programs such as PageMaker, Microsoft Word and MacWrite to non PostScript printers which were much more economical at the time. This provided the user the ability to see the document on the screen as it would appear on the printer.|$|E
