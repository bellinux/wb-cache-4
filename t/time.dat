Bottom <b>time</b> used for decompression planning {{may be defined}} differently depending on the tables or algorithm used. It may include descent <b>time,</b> but not in all cases. It is important to check how bottom <b>time</b> is defined for the tables before they are used. For example, tables using Bühlmann's algorithm define bottom <b>time</b> as the elapsed <b>time</b> between leaving the surface {{and the start of}} the final ascent at 10 metres per minute, and if the ascent rate is slower, then the whole of the ascent <b>time</b> needs to be considered part of the bottom <b>time</b> for the algorithm to remain safe.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Trigger {{takes place}} in a world {{familiar}} to Earth, with eras such as the prehistoric age, in which primitive humans and dinosaurs share the earth; the Middle Ages, replete with knights, monsters, and magic; and the post-apocalyptic future, where destitute humans and sentient robots struggle to survive. The characters frequently travel through <b>time</b> to obtain allies, gather equipment, and learn information to help them in their quest. The party also gains access to the End of <b>Time</b> (represented as year ∞), which serves as a hub to travel back to other <b>time</b> periods. The party eventually acquires a time-machine vehicle known as the Wings of <b>Time,</b> nicknamed the Epoch.
