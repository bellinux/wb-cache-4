5|$|Islamic philosopher Carl Ernst {{has argued}} that {{religious}} language is often political, especially in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>sphere,</b> and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists. Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications.|$|E
5|$|In the 1790s, Johnson aligned {{himself with}} the {{supporters}} of the French Revolution, and published {{an increasing number of}} political pamphlets in addition to a prominent journal, the Analytical Review, which offered British reformers a voice in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b> In 1799, he was indicted on charges of seditious libel for publishing a pamphlet by the Unitarian minister Gilbert Wakefield. After spending six months in prison, albeit under relatively comfortable conditions, Johnson published fewer political works. In the last decade of his career, Johnson did not seek out many new writers; however, he remained successful by publishing the collected works of authors such as William Shakespeare.|$|E

He had commanded the group of Greek colonists who founded Amphipolis in 437–6 BC, had served as a general on several occasions before and during the Peloponnesian War, and was one of the signers of the Peace of Nicias. Hagnon's career overlapped with his son's when he served as one of the ten commissioners appointed by the government of the 400 to draft a new constitution in 411 BC.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMedia {{research}} {{that uses the}} concept of a <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> in order to measure distortion against its ideal standard of dialogic democracy tends to concentrate upon the cognitive aspects of news and either ignores or disdains affective communications.

This article updates the notion of a literary <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> into an expanded concept of <b>the</b> cultural <b>public</b> <b>sphere,</b> including <b>the</b> whole range of media and popular culture. This concept refers to the articulation of politics, public and personal, as a contested terrain through affective (aesthetic and emotional) modes of communication.

5|$|Priestley's friends, {{particularly}} other Rational Dissenters, {{urged him}} to publish a work on the injustices experienced by Dissenters; the result was his Essay on the First Principles of Government (1768). An early work of modern liberal political theory and Priestley's most thorough treatment of the subject, it—unusually for the time—distinguished political rights from civil rights with precision and argued for expansive civil rights. Priestley identified separate private and public spheres, contending {{that the government should}} only have control over <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b> Education and religion, in particular, he maintained, were matters of private conscience and should not be administered by the state. Priestley's later radicalism emerged from his belief that the British government was infringing upon these individual freedoms.|$|E

In both texts, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that the virtue of the British nation is dependent on the virtue of its people. To a great extent, she collapses the distinction between private and public and demands that all educated citizens be offered the chance to participate in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>the</b> virtual <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> in <b>the</b> policy {{process is not}} only dependent {{on the power of}} online media and the stakeholders who are using them. The responsiveness of governments to online policy debate is important as well. While some studies show examples of governments' responsiveness to <b>the</b> virtual <b>public</b> <b>sphere,</b> others find that online participation is largely ignored. Such contrasting findings point at a contingency of governments' responsiveness to online public debate. This article offers a systematic literature review and meta-synthesis of empirical articles that provide insight in the factors accounting for governments' responsiveness to <b>the</b> virtual <b>public</b> <b>sphere.</b> A theory-based analytical framework served as guideline for qualitative analysis of the findings of 39 studies.

25|$|As Habermas argues, in due course, this {{sphere of}} {{rational}} and universalistic politics, free {{from both the}} economy and the State, was destroyed by the same forces that initially established it. This collapse was due to the consumeristic drive that infiltrated society, so citizens became more concerned about consumption than political actions. Furthermore, the growth of capitalistic economy led to an uneven distribution of wealth, thus widening economic polarity. Suddenly the media became a tool of political forces and a medium for advertising rather than the medium from which the public got their information on political matters. This resulted in limiting access to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> and the political control of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>sphere</b> was inevitable for the modern capitalistic forces to operate and thrive in the competitive economy.|$|E
