When the Speaker, Frederick H. Gillett, {{asked if there was}} objection to the consideration of the bill, Ohio's James T. Begg wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was anyone present who could give him information about it, and if there was not, he would object. Kvale stated that he could, and when Begg inquired if Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon favored the bill, he assured the Ohioan that this was so. Kvale had the Senate-passed bill substituted for the one he had introduced, and it received the House's endorsement without objection or amendment. It was passed into law with the signature of President Calvin Coolidge on March 2, 1925.|$|E
500|$|While the {{upheaval}} continued at Spithead, Duncan had retained {{order in the}} North Sea Fleet at Yarmouth by the sheer force of his personality. When men from his flagship, , clambered up into the rigging and roared three cheers in a prearranged signal for the revolt to begin on 1 May, Duncan initially threatened to run the ringleader through with his sword. Calmed by his subordinates, he instead assembled his officers and the Royal Marines aboard his ship and advanced on {{the men in the}} rigging, demanding to know what they were doing. So fierce was his tone that the men fell silent and hesitantly returned to their quarters except for five ringleaders, whom he admonished personally on his quarterdeck before issuing a general pardon and dismissing them to their duty. The following week, he assembled all of the men and demanded to know whether they would follow his orders: in response, the crew nominated a spokesman, who apologised for their actions, saying, [...] "we humbly implore your honour's pardon with hearts full of gratitude and tears in our eyes for the offense we have given to the worthiest of commanders who has proved a father to us". A week later, when a similar outbreak of mutiny affected the fourth rate ship, , under Captain William Hotham, Duncan again acted decisively, coming aboard Adamant as the crew rebelled and demanding <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was any man who disputed his authority. When a sailor stepped forward, Duncan seized him by his shirt and dangled him {{over the side of the}} ship with one arm crying, [...] "My lads – look at this fellow – he who dares to deprive me of command of the fleet". The mutiny evaporated almost instantly.|$|E

[...] It seems for this reason that the differences the listeners identified, if they existed at all, were not intonational.

When analyzing these kinds of data, we might be interested investigating the temporal data process that generated the data.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 60 years, {{there has been}} a shift in how the patient-physician {{relationship}} is viewed. This shift has resulted in patients having {{a more active role in}} the decision-making process in regards to treatments. Modern informed consent requirements seem to demand patients are fully informed in order to offer consent and the absence of deception. An unexpected problem arises when we consider the ethical use of deceptive placebo use in the clinical setting within this modern framework. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>known</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was space within the modern informed consent framework for the lack of information required for effective placebo use, such that the missing information did not constitute deception. Authors, such as Barnhill and Kolber, often misinterpret the AMA doctrine and hold the policy to establishing a categorical prohibition against deceptive clinical placebo use. I will show that these authors have misread the AMA doctrine, but in doing so, their discussions begin to offer some of the missing justification for the AMA policy. I will evaluate three dominant stances within the literature and evaluate them in light of four hypothetical cases. In doing so, I will establish that none of the defenses are able to completely justify the AMA view. Accepting this, I believe that Shaw, working within the negative informed consent framework, offers the most robust defense...|$|R
