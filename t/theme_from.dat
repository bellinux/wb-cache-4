5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Halo 4s {{music and}} the soundtrack was generally positive. However {{the absence of the}} iconic <b>theme</b> <b>from</b> the original Halo trilogy, without the establishment of a new one, received polarised views from players. The album debuted the No. 50 on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States, making it the highest-charting game soundtrack ever.|$|E

5|$|Elliot Goldenthal {{was hired}} by Schumacher to compose the film score before the {{screenplay}} was written. In discussions with Schumacher, the director wanted Goldenthal to avoid taking inspiration from Danny Elfman, and requested an original composition. The film's promotional teaser trailer used the main title <b>theme</b> <b>from</b> Elfman's score of 1989's Batman.|$|E
5|$|The Queen {{declared}} the competition officially open, immediately {{followed by a}} trumpet fanfare based on a <b>theme</b> <b>from</b> Tubular Bells by Mike Oldfield and then a fireworks display. The 2012 ceremony {{was the second time}} the Queen had opened an Olympic Games, the first being the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal in her capacity as Queen of Canada.|$|E
5|$|The ads {{were based}} on the film series and was {{basically}} an amalgamation of both directors visuals. For example, The Batmobile was the one used in Batman and Batman Returns, while the Batsuit was a combination of what was worn by Val Kilmer in Batman Forever and George Clooney in Batman & Robin. The commercials also featured the Danny Elfman Batman <b>theme</b> <b>from</b> Tim Burton's two films.|$|E

5|$|Although Hogg spent {{little time}} at the Varner {{plantation}} after Bayou Bend was constructed, she continued to purchase art and antique furniture on its behalf. In the 1950s, she restored the plantation, and each room was given a different <b>theme</b> <b>from</b> Texas history: colonial times, the Confederacy, Napoleonic times (1818), and the Mexican–American War. One room was dedicated to her father, and contained his desk and chair {{as well as his}} collection of walking sticks. She donated the property to the state, and it was dedicated as the Varner–Hogg Plantation State Historical Site in 1958, the 107th anniversary of Jim Hogg's birth.|$|E

5|$|For the music, the {{development}} team felt that symphony orchestra would {{work best for}} Knights of the Old Republic II. The musical score was composed by Mark Griskey, who developed music and themes for characters and places, including the Jedi's theme, Darth Sion's theme and Darth Nihilus's theme (which both have many similarities with the Emperor's <b>theme</b> <b>from</b> The Return of the Jedi). He also created a theme for the main character, which is heard occasionally {{when he or she}} experiences internal conflict. The 70-minute score was recorded by the Sinfonia Orchestra in Seattle. The opening crawl utilizes the version of John Williams' main Star Wars theme that was re-recorded for the prequel trilogy.|$|E
5|$|Gregson-Williams' {{score is}} darker {{to follow suit}} with the film. Gregson-Williams wanted Caspian's theme to convey a vulnerability, which would sound more vibrant as he became more heroic. It {{originally}} used a 3/4 time signature, but the opening scene required a 4/4 and thus it was changed. To represent Miraz's cunning, the heroic <b>theme</b> <b>from</b> the first film was inverted. For Reepicheep, a muted trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character. Gregson-Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle, but found that it sounded too cute and broke the tension of the night raid.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to the flowing main theme, Khan's leitmotif {{was designed as a}} percussive texture that could be overlaid with other music and emphasized the character's insanity. The seven-note brass theme was echoplexed to emphasize the character's ruminations about the past while on Ceti Alpha V, but does not play fully until Reliants attack on the Enterprise. Many elements drew from Horner's previous work (a rhythm that accompanies Khan's theme during the surprise attack borrows from an attack <b>theme</b> <b>from</b> Wolfen, in turn influenced by Goldsmith's score for Alien). Musical moments from the original television series are also heard during investigation of the Regula space station and elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Jack Jones, who won two Grammy Awards in the 1960s and charted {{dozens of}} songs {{including}} the <b>theme</b> <b>from</b> The Love Boat, recorded an album entitled My Kind of Town with a title track {{by the same}} name. Among the other artists who have recorded versions of the song are Ray Anthony, Count Basie (twice), Ray Conniff, Marvin Gaye, Jackie Gleason, Jeff Harnar, Biréli Lagrène, Steve Lawrence, Julie London, Frankie Randall (several times.

5|$|Milsom street leads up hill, {{from the}} Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, {{which was founded}} in 1738 as The Mineral Water Hospital, to The Paragon which overlooks the Walcot area. The Paragon was {{designed}} by Thomas Warr Attwood. Each building has matching doors and windows with central pediments and flat entablatures either side of the 1st floor windows and Tuscan pilasters and pediments to the doorways. Numbers 22 to 37 continue the <b>theme</b> <b>from</b> numbers 1 to 21 and were completed in 1775 by Joseph Axford, a local mason. Numbers 28 to 32 were damaged by bombing during World War II but have since been restored.|$|E
5|$|Other {{creative}} {{artists have}} celebrated Britten. In 1970 Walton composed Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten, {{based on a}} <b>theme</b> <b>from</b> Britten's Piano Concerto. Works commemorating Britten include Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten an orchestral piece written in 1977 by Arvo Pärt, and Sally Beamish's Variations on a Theme of Benjamin Britten, based on the second Sea Interlude from Peter Grimes; she composed the work to mark Britten's centenary. Alan Bennett depicts Britten in a 2009 play The Habit of Art, set while Britten is composing Death in Venice and centred on a fictional meeting between Britten and Auden. Britten was played in the premiere production by Alex Jennings.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have tried to}} reconcile the conflicting accounts of the Chronicle and the De administrando imperio as implying a first recovery of Patras c. 805 {{as the result of}} Skleros' campaign, which was probably concurrent with the establishment of the Peloponnese as a separate <b>theme</b> <b>from</b> Hellas, if this had not been done slightly earlier. According to this interpretation, the Slavic revolt and attack on Patras followed as a reaction a few years later, between 807 and 811.|$|E
5|$|The {{finale of}} the A major Sonata, uses as its main theme, a {{transformation}} of an earlier <b>theme</b> <b>from</b> the second movement of the Piano Sonata in A minor, D. 537. Schubert introduced some changes to the original melody, which make it conform better with the sonata's basic motifs, {{in accordance with the}} cyclical scheme of the sonata. Another allusion to an earlier piano work appears {{in the middle of the}} sonata's slow movement: after the climax in the middle section of the Andantino, appears a passage (bars 147–158) that closely recalls bars 35–39 from the Impromptu in G-flat major, D. 899.|$|E
5|$|When {{the journey}} continues, the train goes across another access road and enters a tunnel {{containing}} the Grand Canyon Diorama {{followed by the}} Primeval World Diorama. As the train runs alongside the Grand Canyon Diorama, the main <b>theme</b> <b>from</b> On the Trail, the third movement of Ferde Grofé's Grand Canyon Suite, can be heard; and as the train runs alongside the Primeval World Diorama, music from the 1961 film Mysterious Island can be heard. Shortly after leaving the tunnel, the train arrives back at Main Street, U.S.A. Station, completing what the park refers to as The Grand Circle Tour.|$|E
