25|$|Usually {{observational}} astronomy {{is considered}} to occur on Earth's surface (or beneath it in neutrino astronomy). The idea of limiting observation to Earth includes orbiting the Earth. As soon as the observer leaves <b>the</b> <b>cozy</b> confines of Earth, the observer becomes a deep space explorer. Except for Explorer 1 and Explorer 3 and the earlier satellites in the series, usually if a probe {{is going to be}} a deep space explorer it leaves the Earth or an orbit around the Earth.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1969 when Biba {{moved to}} its first upscale store {{on the north side}} of Kensington High Street, across from where they would later open up their {{department}} store, there was a radical change in that the clothes became more expensive and the Biba styles then appeared to be designed for more sophisticated and richer young women in their 20s. The Kensington High Street store also lost <b>the</b> <b>cozy</b> boudoir look of its predecessor, which had been so appealing to its teenage customers, and took on the more sophisticated look of the upscale Kensington/Knightsbridge designer stores.|$|E

2500|$|A {{controversial}} figure, Blocher {{is known}} for his role in transforming Swiss politics, shifting it to the right, as well as the Swiss People's Party, which [...] "developed a eurosceptic and anti-immigration agenda that has shaken up <b>the</b> <b>cozy</b> post-war consensual system prevailing in neutral Switzerland," [...] and has become [...] "the dominant force in national politics." [...] In addition, Blocher served as the de facto leader of the SVP and a symbol of the party.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{locations}} along Route66 in Illinois {{became known}} for their cuisine. [...] One example is the state capital, Springfield. The city has long had an affiliation with food.

One of the first U.S. drive-thru restaurant windows is still in operation in Springfield on Route66 at the Maid-Rite Sandwich Shop.|$|E
2500|$|Aiming for the {{high-end}} market, Gold Dust boasts professional dancers with flamboyant mardi gras-type costumes, and women dancing alongside drag performers. Kumar's trademark provocative jokes {{are still the}} main focus, but now framed in a classier and more streamlined show. Kumar aims to capture <b>the</b> <b>cozy</b> feel and stylish look of New York City-style theatre bars. Thus, the [...] club has no dance floor and all the chairs and tables face the stage. It can hold 180 people, and has {{the feel of a}} 1970s glam disco, updated for the new generation. Instead of young National Servicemen and students, who formed {{a significant part of the}} Boom Boom Room clientele, Gold Dust intends to target a slightly more upper-crust crowd.|$|E

[...] KFJC 89.7 F.M. broadcast live the Saturday Night's performances of Southern California's Saccharine Trust, the legendary Camper Van Beethoven, and the heavily industry backed 28th Day. [...] During the performance, David Lowry, {{the lead singer}} of Camper Van, was clearly heard berating the Program Co-ordinator of the show regarding the mix-up of who the headlining act would be. [...] He was correct in his missive, but more importantly, the performances from all three artists were impressive. [...] On an alternate stage, the band Tex And The Horseheads put on what was said by an attendee to be an inspiringly drunken performance. During the Sunday Matinee of the Convention, two other bands performed in <b>the</b> <b>cozy</b> comfines of {{the top floor of}} the newly rebuilt Hotel. [...] The Muskrats of the Berkeley folk persuasion gave a resounding performance, marred only by the unconrolled burning of one of their musical instruments: their washboard. [...] Quite to the contrary of expectations, the band The Circle Jerks, led by Keith Morris, resplendent in their black tuxedos, put on a wonderfully sublime performance.|$|E
2500|$|Wade Vroom, an [...] "occasional teacher" [...] at Delta {{alternative}} school, [...] "pinned up brochures {{meant to}} advise gay bar and bath house patrons on safe sex procedures" [...] in a grade seven and eight classroom. Liz Sandals, the minister for education, {{stated that it}} was [...] "totally inappropriate." [...] Sandals also stated, [...] "clearly, from what was described in the media, the materials that were being used are totally inappropriate and are in no way connected to the Ontario health and phys ed curriculum" [...] and [...] "I’m relieved that Toronto District School Board (TDSB) has gotten rid of the material and that the teacher {{is no longer in}} the classroom." [...] He had been [...] "ordered [...] to work from home pending an investigation." [...] Sandals called it a [...] "one off." [...] Sandals stated how this type of material would not be included in the new Ontario curriculum. Lisa MacLeod, the critic for education from the Progressive Conservative Party, stated [...] "parents have not asked for this type of sexually explicit information to be made available to their children. The fact that an Ontario teacher felt comfortable enough to post it speaks to <b>the</b> <b>cozy</b> relationship the Liberal government has with their unions." [...] MacLeod feels that the Toronto District School Board is [...] "clearly out of control when it comes to this." [...] She also stated that [...] "this {{is not the first time}} something like has occurred there - and I think the government really has to put their foot down and make it known that that type of material is unacceptable." [...] A spokesman for the school board claimed that the teacher had [...] "good intentions." [...] MacLeod criticized the spokesman and thinks that the school board should fire someone for the material being posted. The AIDS Committee of Toronto, who published one of the brochures, stated that the intended material published by them was for adults. The Toronto Sun asked in an article, [...] "if the teacher now being paid to be at home, or any adult, were to pass out this material in a park, would the police not be called?" [...] and when is the TDSB going to notify police about a brochure teaching children?"safer sucking tips?" [...] A spokesman for the board stated, [...] "At this time, police have not been notified." [...] Toronto Police Service investigated the brochures and decided that no charges would be pressed against Vroom because it [...] "didn't meet Criminal Code criteria to lay charges for exposing children to obscene material or corrupting the morals of children." [...] Vroom was later reinstated after the issue had been [...] "resolved." ...|$|E

Dodd's amendment passed and Guatemala received $15 million of US aid in 1956. Dodd was unapologetic when criticized for his lobbying {{efforts on behalf of}} the Guatemalan dictatorship. When a Republican organizer challenged Dodd on his lobbying, Dodd stated [...] "I am a practicing attorney and I am {{proud of the fact that}} the anti-communist government of Guatemala has asked me to handle its legal affairs in the US.
