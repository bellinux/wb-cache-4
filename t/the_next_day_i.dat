25|$|One common {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} possibility exists that one might misremember the sensation, and therefore {{one does not have}} any firm criterion for using S in each case. So, for example, I might one day focus on that sensation, and link it to the symbol S; but <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> have no criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now {{is the same as the}} one yesterday, except for my memory; and since my memory might fail me, I have no firm criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now is indeed S.|$|E

In his words, [...] "One day, I was a Raith Rovers player who couldnae pull the birds at the Cowdenbeath Palais. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> was in Glasgow {{and the girls}} were {{throwing}} themselves at me. It was certainly a change and I wasn't letting it go by." [...] However, in 1965 he married Jean Ferguson, a hairdresser, and the couple brought up two sons Alan and Steven. His marriage to Jean broke down in 1981 and the two divorced. Jean married golfer William McCondichie three years later. In 1983 Baxter formed a relationship with Norma Morton, and the couple remained together {{until his death in}} 2001.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{biography}} Michael Jackson: The Magic and the Madness, written by journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli, the pop singer had shown an early {{attachment to the}} story of E.T.

I kissed him before I left. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> missed him." [...] Jackson later revealed in the December 1982 issue of Ebony magazine—in which both he and E.T. appear on the cover—that he felt he actually was the creature during the album recording and shared his thoughts on why he had such a strong connection to the character: ...|$|E

The name stuck and they went by Godsmack from then on. We {{were aware of the}} Alice in Chains song but didn't really think much about it." [...] In 1996, Tony Rombola and Joe D'Arco joined Godsmack as the guitarist and drummer, after Richards left upon learning he had a six-year-old child and Stewart left due to personal differences. In the same year, the band entered the studio for the first time, recording its first CD titled All Wound Up. The CD was recorded in just three days for $2,600.|$|E

500|$|After {{hearing the}} material, {{president}} Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where {{half of the}} album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others. Martin showed Spears and her management a track titled [...] "Hit Me Baby One More Time", which was originally written for American R group TLC; however, they rejected it. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when she heard it and {{knew it was going}} to be a hit. [...] "We at Jive said, 'This is a fuckin' smash'," [...] revealed the label's A executive, Steven Lunt; however, other executives were concerned that the line [...] "Hit Me" [...] would condone domestic violence, and later revised it to [...] "...Baby One More Time".

500|$|During summer 2001, Black Isle Studios {{employed}} three development teams. These {{included the}} Icewind Dale team, the team developing Torn, {{and a team}} working on an unannounced project. Before and during Torns development, several members of its team expressed interest in developing another game using the Infinity Engine. The development team was not made aware of Black Isle Studios' decision to develop Icewind Dale II until Torns cancellation. Lead designer J. E. Sawyer described, [...] "I don't know when the producers {{decided to make the}} game, but I was told that we were making the game when I learned that TORN was being cancelled ... on a Wednesday afternoon", and that Feargus Urquhart [...] "asked me to work with Steve Bokkes to create a story and area overview by Thursday afternoon.

I went home that night and worked on the overviews until <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>I</b> came in and turned the docs in, and after the Friday division meeting, the project was in development." [...] During this period, Interplay Entertainment relied on Black Isle Studios' games to alleviate financial trouble, which put pressure to release games quickly. The decision to develop Icewind Dale II was based partly on the original Icewind Dales reception, and the development teams' ability to create a game with the Infinity Engine relatively quickly. Sawyer said of the decision, [...] "In all honesty, the reasons for making Icewind Dale II have to do with limiting risks and maximizing our chances for a popular title." [...] Conceptualization of Icewind Dale II progressed during the development of the Icewind Dale expansions, and production began late July 2001, shortly after the completion of [...] After six months of development, Icewind Dale II was officially announced on February 4, 2002.|$|E

[...] "We at JIVE said, 'This is a ... smash'," [...] revealed the label's A executive at the time Steven Lunt; however, other executives were concerned that the line [...] "Hit Me" [...] would condone domestic violence, later being revised to [...] "...Baby One More Time". Spears recorded her vocals for the song on May 2 and 3 of 1998 at Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The singer revealed that she [...] "didn’t do well at all the first day in the studio , I was just too nervous.

[...] The track was produced by Denniz Pop, Martin and Rami, and was also mixed by Martin at Cheiron Studios. Thomas Lindberg played the guitar, while Johan Carlberg played the bass guitar. Background vocals were provided by Spears, Martin and Nana Hedin. Spears also recorded a track called [...] "Autumn Goodbye", written and produced by Eric Foster White, that was released as a b-side to [...] "...Baby One More Time".

She later reflected, [...] "My career is inexplicable and it's a career path that nobody should follow! It basically starts with an 18-year old refusing {{to go to}} university {{because that was the}} one thing that my parents wanted of me, that and to be slim. So I defied both of those desires. My mother said I had to get a job, which shocked me. There was a new newspaper opening up in Australia called Go-Set and I walked into the office and I started work <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>I</b> don't think this would happen today."

[...] Fellow writers included Vince Lovegrove, Molly Meldrum, Ed Nimmervoll and Stan Rofe. In November 1966 Brett was interviewed on The Go!! Show, a Victorian-based pop music show, by its host, Johnny Young (also a pop singer).
