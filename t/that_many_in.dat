5|$|For hand weapons, most Roman foot {{carried a}} thrusting-spear (hasta) and a sword (spatha). Among the Alamanni, spears were the {{universal}} weapon, swords were probably less common. Nobles (optimates) {{and the professional}} warrior-retainers of ringgivers certainly had them. For the lower ranks the position is not certain. Ammianus' report on the battle implies <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the Alamanni ranks carried swords. Those that did not were armed with a seax (long pointed Germanic knives with some types being shortswords) {{as well as a}} spear and/or battle axe.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{allegations}} were {{made that the}} government of Pakistan had shielded bin Laden. Critics cited the proximity of bin Laden's heavily fortified compound to the Pakistan Military Academy, that the U.S. chose to not notify Pakistani authorities before the operation, and the double standards of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. U.S. government files, leaked by Wikileaks, disclosed that American diplomats had been told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time U.S. forces approached. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), also helped smuggle al-Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight NATO troops. According to the leaked files, in December 2009, the government of Tajikistan had also told U.S. officials <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> Pakistan were aware of bin Laden's whereabouts.|$|E

5|$|The second {{show was}} widely {{acknowledged}} as {{superior to the}} afternoon performance, although Village Voice reviewer Don Heckman noted <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the audience reacted to the Shankar–Khan opening set {{with a lack of}} respect. Not aiding the Indian musicians was the failure of a microphone on Rakha's hand drums, Heckman observed, so denying the crowd a vital element of the musical interplay between sitar and sarod.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} crossings, steamers took the crowds from Circular Quay, although this time only four were needed, while another 600–700 people {{made their own}} way to the site. The ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 December, but delays meant L'Estrange did not appear until 6 pm. Although the length of rope was over 182 metres, it was only just over nine metres above the water. The stay wires were held in boats on either side, with the crews rowing against each other to keep it steady. L'Estrange rode his bicycle towards the centre, where, with the rope swinging to and fro, he stopped briefly to steady himself but instead, realising he was losing his balance, {{he was forced to}} leap from the rope and fell into the water below. Although he was unhurt, it was another knock to his reputation. A repeat attempt was announced for the following weekend. Again steamers took a dwindling crowd to Banbury Bay where they found L'Estrange's rope had been mysteriously cut, and he cancelled the performance. The Daily Telegraph reported <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the crowd, who had paid for tickets on the steamers, felt they had been scammed.|$|E

They took their mostly black congregations with them. They adopted the Methodist Doctrine and elected their first two bishops, William H. Miles of Kentucky and Richard H. Vanderhorst of South Carolina. Within three years, from a base of about 40,000, they had grown to 67,000 members, and more than te times <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> 50 years.|$|E
25|$|In late 1936 he {{was invited}} to join the {{influential}} Savoy Ballroom orchestra, led by the drummer Chick Webb. Based at New York's Savoy Ballroom, Webb's orchestra was renowned {{as one of the best}} big bands of its day and regularly beat all comers at the Savoy's legendary cutting contests. Jordan worked with Webb until 1938, and it proved a vital stepping-stone in his career—Webb (who was physically disabled) was a fine musician but not a great showman. The ebullient Jordan often introduced songs as he began singing lead; he later recalled <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the audience took him to be the band's leader, which undoubtedly boosted his confidence further. This was the same period when the young Ella Fitzgerald was coming to prominence as the Webb band's lead female vocalist; she and Jordan often sang duets on stage, and they later reprised their partnership on several records, by which time both were major stars.|$|E
25|$|While {{residents}} {{in and around}} the town still extract some lead and silver from the hillsides, the town is best known for being in middle of much of the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, with two sanctuaries open to the public nearby: Sierra Chincua and El Rosario. The town’s association with the butterflies came when magazines such as National Geographic and México Desconocido began promoting it, along with neighboring Ocampo. The town hosts an annual monarch butterfly festival each year in February to bid goodbye as the insects head north again. The festival consists of artistic and cultural events as well as those related to the region’s traditions and customs. Another annual cultural event is the Day of the Miner on 11 July, which is held to honor a way of life <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the town do not wish to lose. The rest of the municipality’s annual festivals are religious including the feasts of Santa Cruz on May 3, San Simon on October 28 and the Immaculate Conception on December 8.|$|E

500|$|The name [...] "the Peasants' Revolt" [...] {{emerged in}} the 18th and early 19th centuries, and its first {{recorded}} use by historians was in John Richard Green's Short History of the English People in 1874. Contemporary chronicles did not give the revolt a specific title, and the term [...] "peasant" [...] did {{not appear in the}} English language until the 15th century. The title has been critiqued by modern historians such as Miri Rubin and Paul Strohm, both on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the movements were not peasants, and that the events more closely resemble a prolonged protest or rising, rather than a revolt or rebellion.|$|E

Van der Byl's aristocratic background, military experience and academic credentials combined to give him an almost iconic status within the Rhodesian Front.

Writing in South Africa's Daily Dispatch, Michael Hartnack remarked <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> the Rhodesian Front believed him to be [...] "a 19th century-style connoisseur, a man of culture and an aristocrat-statesman", adding that [...] "poseurs are an incipient hazard in any unsophisticated society."

"Gay Power, Gay Politics" [...] {{continued}} to be a target of criticism by LGBT community leaders and authors, although some have acknowledged that the program included [...] "more than a few kernels of truth".

She further castigated the show for excluding lesbians and people of color (although she acknowledges that this to an extent mirrored the state of gay leadership at the time) and noted her belief that anti-gay attack videos produced in the 1990s were modeled on this broadcast.

[...] In the Quran itself, [...] "God often instructs Muhammad to be patient to those who insult him and, according to historical records, no action was taken against them during his years in Mecca." [...] Many Muslims said their anti-cartoon stance is against insulting pictures and not so much as against pictures in general.
