He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas in the mid-1960s, long before the personal computer revolution, at a time when most computers were inaccessible to individuals who could only use computers through intermediaries (see batch processing), and when software tended to be written for vertical applications in proprietary systems.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>the</b> {{problem of}} <b>on-line</b> scheduling two-machine open shops {{with the objective}} of minimizing the makespan. Jobs arrive independently over time, and the existence of a job is not known until its arrival. In <b>the</b> clairvoyant <b>on-line</b> model, <b>the</b> processing requirement of every job becomes fully known at the arrival of the job, while in <b>the</b> non-clairvoyant <b>on-line</b> model, this processing requirement is not known until the job is processed and completed. In both models, scheduling of a job is irrevocable. We study the two-machine open shop problem for both models in the preemptive and in the non-preemptive version. For each of the four variants, we provide an algorithm that is best possible with respect to the worst-case performance. In <b>the</b> clairvoyant <b>on-line</b> model, <b>the</b> best worst-case performance ratios are 5 / 4 (preemptive) and 3 / 2 (non-preemptive), and in <b>the</b> non-clairvoyant <b>on-line</b> model, they are 3 / 2 (preemptive and non-preemptive). ...|$|R

An example {{is the use of}} a marker-based program in the treatment of prostate cancer at Princess Margaret Hospital. Gold markers are implanted into the prostate to provide a surrogate position of the gland. Prior to each day's treatment, portal imaging system results are returned. If the center of the mass has moved greater than 3mm, then the couch is readjusted and a subsequent reference image is created. Other clinics correct for any positional errors, never allowing for >1mm error in any measured axes.|$|E

The metadata format used is the Dublin Core metadata standard. For metadata harvesting from <b>the</b> Agris <b>on-line</b> repository we use the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting standard, version 2. 0. Creators and administrators of <b>the</b> Agris <b>on-line</b> Papers in Economics and Informatics used their own solution for metadata storage and services for the metadata harvesting.
