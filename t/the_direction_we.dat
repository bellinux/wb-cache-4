According to Paul Ruditis, authors of Charmed novels and comics must maintain [...] "the rules for playing in that universe" [...] and [...] "the studio still has to approve <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>we</b> take" [...] as writers. Following these regulations, authors are given creative license but strictly [...] "couldn't go and rewrite history, killing off established characters or suddenly creating romantic pairings that we'd never see on the show".|$|E

We had largely all the elements of the episode in place and Fox called and said, 'Hey, how would you guys feel about if we asked you to have some musical element in the show? Anything, like just feature a song playing.' They didn't ask us to do Glee. And we instantly, before we got off the phone, said, 'Well, this is what we're thinking for the episode and here's an idea how that could work for us.' We turned their request into what felt like a positive for us and really deepened and sort of blew the episode out even further in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>we</b> were already taking it".|$|E

[...] "Shooting at the VLA was, of course, spectacular but {{also one of the most}} difficult aspects of our filming," [...] producer Steve Starkey said. [...] "It is a working facility, so in order for us to accomplish shots for the movie, we had to negotiate with the National Science Foundation for 'dish control' in order to move the dishes in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>we</b> needed to effect the most dramatic shot for the story." [...] After arduous first weeks of location shooting in New Mexico and Arizona, production for Contact returned to Los Angeles for five months' worth of location and sound stage shooting that used a total of nine soundstages at Warner Bros.Studios in Burbank, and Culver Studios. All together, the art department created more than 25 sets.|$|E
500|$|Pinkner {{thought the}} added musical element {{improved}} the episode, {{because it gave}} insights into each of the characters' psyches. According to Wyman and Pinkner, the [...] "episode {{was supposed to be}} a fantastical episode in the first place, and so the music supports the storytelling". Wyman continued in a different interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "Noirs traditionally are morality tales, and that's kind of what we're doing. We felt that that was a great way to get across Walter's mind frame and where his head is at right now, with his son missing". Other cast members also praised the added music. John Noble wrote [...] "It really deepened and blew the episode out even further in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>we</b> were already taking. We get [...] fractured take on the world and his condition now that Peter has left. The music really supports the storytelling". He added, [...] "It is like a mind-trip of Walter's. It is Walter trying to grapple with the fact that his son is gone". Jasika Nicole continued: [...] "I have a musical theater background, so I've been waiting for some moment in some realm of where I am in TV and film for this to happen and, you know, of course, when Glee came on the air I was like, 'Great, that was my chance,' and I'm in this show, which I love this show, but I'm never going to sing and dance in this show. And I did! It's so awesome!" [...] Swerling called it [...] "the longest and possibly most difficult episode of the season" [...] to create.|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, co-writer and {{producer}} of the song, Xavier [...] "Zaytoven" [...] Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song. Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so people can see I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>we</b> needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E

During the spring of 1982, they went on tour in Scandinavia with three tracks completed: [...] "Cascade", [...] "Painted Bird" [...] and [...] "Green Fingers". When they {{returned}} to the studio in July, the group embarked on a week of improvisation sparked off by a tape-looped section of the orchestral version of [...] "Fireworks", a non-album single they had released in May. Other numbers followed easily. Siouxsie didn't want to use synthesizers for the arrangements: [...] "Fireworks" [...] indicated <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>we</b> wanted for the album. We wanted strings [...] John [...] wanted a machine but Steve [...] and I said it had to be real strings. They give a real, earthy, rich sound.

We've always thought our songs would suit orchestration. Real strings have a very physical sound".|$|E
2500|$|Avatar: The Last Airbender co-creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko voiced {{their opinion}} within an {{interview}} regarding Shyamalan writing, directing, and producing the film. The two displayed much enthusiasm over Shyamalan's {{decision for the}} adaptation, stating that they admire his work and, in turn, he respects their material. Producer Frank Marshall explained that they have high hopes to stick to a PG rating. [...] "I'm not even sure {{we want to get}} in the PG-13 realm. Furthermore, Shyamalan said, [...] "A lot of the inspiration for <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>we</b> took comes from a friend of mine. A Nathan Blackmer helped shape this Idea into the film it became. I took away {{a little bit of the}} slapsticky stuff that was there for the little little kids, the fart jokes and things like that...We grounded Katara's brother...and that really did wonderful things for the whole theme of the movie." [...] Paramount's president Brad Grey said that despite the director's career being inconsistent, he [...] "believed in [...] vision and that he could execute it," [...] adding that [...] "It's a bold step because he had to create a potential new franchise." [...] The studio was willing to spend $250 million in a trilogy of films, one for each season. The Last Airbenders budget wound up being $150 million, with later over $130 million being spent on marketing costs, making it Shyamalan's most expensive film. During production, the name Avatar was removed from the title to avoid confusion with the highly-successful 2009 film Avatar.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly before halftime of the Saturday evening {{game between}} the Oklahoma Sooners and the Kansas State Wildcats, spectators inside the stadium heard an {{explosion}}. The explosion was reported as being heard up to five miles away, but people {{on the east side}} of the stadium heard only a rumble like a low-volume thunder, of the type that signals impending rain. A few heard nothing. [...] Spectators were not allowed to leave the stadium at half-time, which caused concern among fans who did hear the explosion. No stadium announcements were made until the third and fourth quarters of play, when bus drivers were asked to leave the stadium and meet at the northwest corner of the Asp Avenue Parking Facility. [...] During the last six minutes of the game, an announcement was made over the public address system in the stadium and over local radio to exit through the south and east gates and to avoid the area, known to students and fans as the South Oval, west of the stadium. [...] No further explanations were given to game attendees because university officials [...] "didn't want to start any kind of panic." [...] "Everyone in my [...] section heard it. We looked to the opposite side of the field though thinking it was thunder.

40|$|Abstract—Individuals with {{cognitive}} impairments are often prevented from independently living, working, and fully participating {{in their community}} due to wayfinding concerns.
