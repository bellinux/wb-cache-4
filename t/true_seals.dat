5|$|The walrus's {{body shape}} shares {{features}} with both sea lions (eared seals: Otariidae) and seals (true seals: Phocidae). As with otariids, it can turn its rear flippers forward {{and move on}} all fours; however, its swimming technique is more like that of <b>true</b> <b>seals,</b> relying less on flippers and more on sinuous whole body movements. Also like phocids, it lacks external ears.|$|E
5|$|The walrus is a mammal in {{the order}} Carnivora. It is the sole {{surviving}} {{member of the family}} Odobenidae, one of three lineages in the suborder Pinnipedia along with <b>true</b> <b>seals</b> (Phocidae) and eared seals (Otariidae). While there has been some debate as to whether all three lineages are monophyletic, i.e. descended from a single ancestor, or diphyletic, recent genetic evidence suggests all three descended from a caniform ancestor most closely related to modern bears. Recent multigene analysis indicates the odobenids and otariids diverged from the phocids about 20–26 million years ago, while the odobenids and the otariids separated 15–20 million years ago. Odobenidae was once a highly diverse and widespread family, including at least twenty species in the subfamilies Imagotariinae, Dusignathinae and Odobeninae. The key distinguishing feature was the development of a squirt/suction feeding mechanism; tusks are a later feature specific to Odobeninae, of which the modern walrus is the last remaining (relict) species.|$|E
500|$|Monk seals are {{earless seals}} (<b>true</b> <b>seals)</b> {{of the tribe}} Monachini. The tribe was first {{conceived}} by Victor Blanchard Scheffer in his 1958 book Seals, Sea Lions, and Walruses: A Review of the Pinnipedia. There are two genera of monk seals, Monachus and Neomonachus, comprising three species: the Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus), the Hawaiian monk seal (Neomonachus schauinslandi), and the Caribbean monk seal (Neomonachus tropicalis), which became extinct in the 20th century. All three monk seal species were classified in genus Monachus until 2014, when comparison of the species' mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA sequences led biologists to place the Caribbean and Hawaiian species in a new genus, Neomonachus.|$|E

2500|$|The genetically and {{visually}} related dark bay coat color, which also features black points and a near-black body, differs from <b>true</b> <b>seal</b> brown {{in the absence}} of tan markings. The term [...] "seal brown" [...] is to be distinguished from the term [...] "brown." [...] Another mimic is the liver chestnut, an all-over dark brown coat including mane and tail, that is sometimes confused with <b>seal</b> brown. However, <b>true</b> <b>seal</b> browns have black points characteristic of all bay horses, while liver chestnuts do not.|$|R
50|$|The {{ribbon seal}} (Histriophoca fasciata) is a {{medium-sized}} pinniped from the <b>true</b> <b>seal</b> family (Phocidae). A seasonally ice-bound species, {{it is found}} in the Arctic and Subarctic regions of the North Pacific Ocean, notably in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. It is distinguished by its striking coloration, with two wide white strips and two circles against dark brown or black fur.|$|R
500|$|Phocids {{are known}} as true or [...] "earless" [...] seals. These animals lack {{external}} ear flaps and are incapable of turning their hind-flippers forward, which makes them more cumbersome on land. In water, <b>true</b> <b>seals</b> swim by moving their hind-flippers and lower body from side to side. Phocids have thickened mastoids, enlarged entotympanic bones, everted pelvic bones and massive ankle bones. They also lack supraorbital processes on the frontal and have underdeveloped calcaneal tubers. A 2006 molecular study supports the division of phocids into two monophyletic subfamilies: Monachinae, which consists of Mirounga, Monachini and Lobodontini; and Phocinae, which includes Pusa, Phoca, Halichoerus, Histriophoca, Pagophilus, Erignathus and Cystophora.|$|E
500|$|The California {{sea lion}} was {{described}} by René Primevère Lesson, a French naturalist, in 1828. It is grouped with other sea lions and fur seals in the family Otariidae. Otariids, also known as eared seals, differ from <b>true</b> <b>seals</b> in having external ear flaps, and proportionately larger foreflippers and pectoral muscles. Along with the Galapagos sea lion and the extinct Japanese sea lion, the California sea lion belongs to the genus Zalophus, which derives from the Greek words za, meaning [...] "intensive," [...] and lophus, meaning [...] "crest." [...] This refers to the protruding sagittal crest of the males, which distinguishes members of the genus.|$|E
500|$|Pinnipeds (...) (from Latin pinna [...] "fin" [...] and pes, pedis [...] "foot"), {{commonly}} known as seals, are a widely distributed and diverse clade of carnivorous, fin-footed, semiaquatic marine mammals. They comprise the extant families Odobenidae (whose only living member is the walrus), Otariidae (the eared seals: sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (the earless seals, or <b>true</b> <b>seals).</b> There are 33 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic lineage (descended from one ancestral line). Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora and their closest living relatives are bears and musteloids (weasels, raccoons, skunks, and red pandas), having diverged about 50 million years ago.|$|E
2500|$|<b>True</b> <b>seal</b> {{brown is}} best {{described}} as a black or nearly-black coat with reddish or tan hairs on the [...] "soft parts": the muzzle, eyes, inner ears, underbelly, behind the elbow, {{and in front of}} the stifle. Like other coat colors, seal browns can range in shade. The very darkest are just about black except for their tan areas. Lighter examples are easily confused with dark bays. The mane, tail, and legs are always black.|$|R
5000|$|The Ross seal (Ommatophoca rossii) is a <b>true</b> <b>seal</b> (family Phocidae) {{with a range}} {{confined}} {{entirely to}} the pack ice of Antarctica. It is the only species of the genus Ommatophoca. First described during the Ross expedition in 1841, it is the smallest, least abundant and least well known of the Antarctic pinnipeds. Its distinctive features include disproportionately large eyes, whence its scientific name (Ommato- meaning [...] "eye", and phoca meaning [...] "seal"), and complex, trilling and siren-like vocalizations.|$|R
2500|$|The {{research}} {{behind the}} classification of seal brown as distinct from dark bay is quite new, and as a result, opinions vary on what constitutes a <b>true</b> <b>seal</b> brown. In Equine Color Genetics, Dan Phillip Sponenberg wrote [...] "In general, all dark colors with black points that are lighter than black but darker than bay are called brown." [...] In this text, he classifies black-pointed, clear reddish coats of any shade as bay, and black-pointed coats of any shade with black countershading as brown. These definitions, while precise, are no longer accurate in light of current research.|$|R
6000|$|... "The <b>true</b> <b>Seals</b> are short-necked, thick-bodied, {{and have}} rather round heads with no visible ears. The Walrus and Sea Lions can turn their hind {{flippers}} forward {{to use as}} feet on land, but this the <b>true</b> <b>Seals</b> cannot do. Therefore they are more clumsy out of water. Their front flippers are covered with hair.|$|E
50|$|Unlike otariids, <b>true</b> <b>seals</b> do not {{communicate}} by 'barking'. Instead, they {{communicate by}} slapping {{the water and}} grunting.|$|E
50|$|The Juan Fernandez {{fur seal}} {{is part of}} the group of eared seals. Fur seals in general have thick {{insulating}} fur that protects the skin from cold water, they have small ear flaps on the side of their head, and they hold their weight on their front flippers which are also used for land locomotion. Fur seals are different from <b>true</b> <b>seals</b> because they have the external ear flaps, but also <b>true</b> <b>seals</b> use their chest for support and movement, fur seals walk on their front flippers.|$|E
5000|$|Hadrokirus martini is an {{extinct species}} of <b>true</b> <b>seal</b> (Phocidae) that {{lived on the}} coast of Peru about 6 million years ago. It was found in the Pisco Formation, {{together}} with other marine animals such as crustaceans, sharks, coastal birds, whales and aquatic sloths. The main particularity of this seal dwells in its teeth: they are extremely robust, hence the name (hadros, [...] "stout" [...] in Greek; kiru, tooth in Quechua). It is assumed that Hadrokirus martini was durophagous, its diet probably comprised crustaceans, small bivalves and other shelled animals, as it is seen for instance in the living sea otter. The extant seals the most closely related to Hadrokirus martini are the Lobodontini (seals from Antarctica).|$|R
2500|$|Buckskin {{is also a}} {{well-known}} color, produced {{by the action of}} one cream gene on a bay coat. All red hairs in the base coat are diluted to gold.

The Baikal seal is the only species of exclusively freshwater seal.|$|E

5000|$|Enaliarctos {{has been}} heralded as the {{ancestor}} of all known pinnipeds, including the families Otariidae (fur seals and sea lions), Desmatophocidae (extinct seal convergent pinnipeds), Phocidae (<b>true</b> <b>seals),</b> and Odobenidae (walruses). Investigations of the biomechanics of Enaliarctos {{indicate that it}} used both its forelimbs and hindlimbs during swimming. Modern fur seals and sea lions only use their forelimbs, while <b>true</b> <b>seals</b> primarily use their hindlimbs for aquatic propulsion; lastly, the extant walrus uses both fore- and hindlimbs for swimming. It has been postulated that the condition in Enaliarctos is ancestral for all pinnipeds, and that forelimb swimming was lost in <b>true</b> <b>seals,</b> while hindlimb swimming was lost in fur seals and sea lions. This is significant {{because there has been}} considerable debate as to whether pinnipeds share common ancestry. Interpretation of Enaliarctos indicates that all pinnipeds share a common ancestor (which, if it was not Enaliarctos, must have been something very similar, such as the more newly discovered Puijila darwini.) ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>true</b> <b>seal</b> tribe Lobodontini, collectively {{known as}} the lobodontine seals, consist of four species of seals in four genera: the crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophaga), the leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), the Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli), and the Ross seal (Ommatophoca rossii). All lobodontine seals have {{circumpolar}} distributions surrounding Antarctica. They include both the world's most abundant seal (the crabeater seal) and the only predominantly mammal-eating seal (the leopard seal). While the Weddell seal prefers the shore-fast ice, the other species live primarily on and around the off-shore pack ice. Thus, though they are collectively the most abundant group of seals in the world, the combination of remote range and inaccessible habitat make them among the least well studied of the world's seals.|$|R
50|$|Common seals, or harbor seals, {{are nearly}} {{threatened}} <b>true</b> <b>seal</b> species, inhabiting temperate and Arctic marine coastlines of the Northern hemisphere. They {{are found in}} coastal waters of the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans {{as well as those}} of the Baltic and North Seas.Harbor seals are brown, tan, or gray, with distinctive V-shaped nostrils. An adult can attain a length of 1.85 meters (6.1 ft) and a mass of 132 kilograms (290 lbs). Females outlive males (30-35 years versus 20-25 years). Harbor seals stick to familiar resting spots, generally rocky areas where land predators can't reach them, near a steady supply of fish to eat. Their global population is 400,000 to 500,000, and subspecies in certain habitats are threatened. Seal hunting, once a common practice, is now mostly illegal.|$|R
50|$|Among mammals otariids (fur seals) swim {{primarily}} with their front flippers, using the rear flippers for steering, and phocids (<b>true</b> <b>seals)</b> move the rear flippers laterally, pushing the animal through the water.|$|E
50|$|In harbor seals, the {{structure}} of the vibrissal shaft is undulated (wavy) and flattened. This specialization is also found in most <b>true</b> <b>seals.</b> In contrast, the whiskers of the California sea lion are circular or elliptical in cross-section and are smooth.|$|E
5000|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{classified}} as carnivores and are divided between earless or <b>true</b> <b>seals</b> and eared seals. <b>True</b> <b>seals</b> {{do not have}} ears and cannot get their hind flippers underneath their bodies to crawl.

5000|$|The {{ringed seal}} is the {{smallest}} and most common seal in the Arctic, with a small head, short cat-like snout, and a plump body. Its coat is dark with silver rings {{on the back and}} sides with a silver belly, from which this seal gets its vernacular name. Depending on subspecies and condition, adult size can range from 100 to 175 cm and weigh from 32 to 140 kg. The seal averages about 5 ft long with a weight of about 50 - 70 kg. [...] This species is usually considered the smallest species in the <b>true</b> <b>seal</b> family, although several related species, especially the Baikal seal, may approach similarly diminutive dimensions.

2500|$|The crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophaga) is a <b>true</b> <b>seal</b> with a {{circumpolar}} distribution {{around the}} coast of Antarctica. They are medium- to large-sized (over 2 m in length), relatively slender and pale-colored, found primarily on the free-floating pack ice that extends seasonally out from the Antarctic coast, which they use as a platform for resting, mating, social aggregation and accessing their prey. They {{are by far the}} most abundant seal species in the world. While population estimates are uncertain, there are at least 7 million and possibly as many as 75 million individuals. [...] This success of this species is due to its specialized predation on the abundant Antarctic krill of the Southern Ocean, for which it has uniquely adapted, sieve-like tooth structure. Indeed, its scientific name, translated as [...] "lobe-toothed (lobodon) crab eater (carcinophaga)", refers specifically to the finely lobed teeth adapted to filtering their small crustacean prey. Despite its name, crabeater seals do not eat crabs. As well as being an important krill predator, the crabeater seal is {{an important component of the}} diet of leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx), which consume about 80% of all crabeater pups.|$|R
5000|$|The Weddell seal, Leptonychotes weddellii, is a {{relatively}} large and abundant <b>true</b> <b>seal</b> (family: Phocidae) with a circumpolar distribution surrounding Antarctica. Weddell seals have the most southerly distribution of any mammal, with a habitat that extends {{as far south as}} McMurdo Sound (at 77°S). It is the only species in the genus Leptonychotes, and {{the only member of the}} Antarctic tribe of lobodontine seals to prefer in-shore habitats on shore-fast ice over free-floating pack ice. Genetic evidence suggests that Weddell seal population numbers may have increased during the Pleistocene. [...] Because of its abundance, relative accessibility, and ease of approach by humans, it is the best-studied of the Antarctic seals. An estimated 800,000 individuals remain today. A genetic survey did not detect evidence of a recent, sustained genetic bottleneck in this species, which suggests that populations do not appear to have suffered a substantial and sustained decline in the recent past. Weddell seal pups leave their mothers at a few months of age. In those months, they are fed by their mothers' warming and fat-rich milk. They leave when they are ready to hunt and are fat enough to survive in the harsh weather.|$|R
