5|$|Although the art {{produced}} (particularly pottery, grave stelai and figurines) {{was used}} by {{a wider range of}} people than much Athenian literature was—including women and children—it is not known how accurately the iconography of classical art mapped <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> classical society.|$|E
5|$|Although the story's {{central theme}} is loneliness, it uses shoes and rain as motifs, along with Man'yōshū poetry and the Japanese garden {{in which it}} is set. Although rain is {{typically}} seen as sad and gloomy, in The Garden of Words it makes the world more vivid and protects the two main characters from <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> their lives and the limitations imposed by society. Shinkai also noted a parallel between love and rain—that neither can be controlled or stopped.|$|E
5|$|Based on Henry VIII's {{desire for}} an {{annulment}} {{of his marriage}} (first requested of Pope Clement VII in 1527), the English Reformation was at the outset more of a political affair than a theological dispute. <b>The</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> political differences between Rome and England allowed growing theological disputes {{to come to the}} fore.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1968 season, the MCC's public position followed the advice of Douglas-Home: it was unknown whether or not South Africa would accept D'Oliveira and it would be better not to press the issue. Even so, three key members of the MCC were aware of <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> the situation. Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.|$|E
5|$|Farm {{animals are}} {{widespread}} {{in books and}} songs for children; <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> animal husbandry is often distorted, softened, or idealized, giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life. The books often depict a rural idyll of happy animals free to roam in attractive countryside, which is completely {{at odds with the}} realities of the impersonal, mechanized activities involved in modern intensive farming.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{also has}} {{positive}} arguments {{in favour of}} <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> mental representations {{in terms of the}} LOT. He maintains that if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.|$|E

5|$|In the ONA's terminology, {{the terms}} Drecc and Niner refer to folk-based or gang-based culture or {{individuals}} {{who support the}} Order's aims by practical (including criminal) means rather than esoteric ones.

5|$|The Copenhagen interpretation, Part I ("There is no deep reality.")

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> {{defeat for}} Austria caused a reevaluation of {{internal}} divisions, local autonomy, and liberalism.

Through military victory, Prussia under Bismarck's influence had overcome Austria's active resistance {{to the idea of}} a unified Germany. Austria's influence over the German states may have been broken, but the war also splintered the spirit of pan-German unity: most of the German states resented Prussian power politics.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{observations}} of gravity-related phenomena during solar eclipses, especially during the period of totality.

5|$|According {{to friends}} and family, he had {{extensive}} historical knowledge and was deeply disillusioned with <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> communist Poland. He supported the protesting students during the March 1968 Polish political crisis in Poland, printing bibuła leaflets and asking his daughter to distribute them. According to health professionals, he was of sound mind, and fully rational, {{at the time of}} his suicide. Siwiec planned his self-immolation months in advance, writing out a last will in April, and leaving written and tape-recorded statements explaining his revulsion at both the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and the People's Republic of Poland's participation in it.|$|E

Both have up-and-down relationships with their two children: the intelligent-but-rebellious Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), and underachiever A.J. (i.e., Anthony, Jr.) (Robert Iler), whose everyday teenage issues are further complicated by their eventual knowledge of their father's criminal activities and reputation.|$|E
5|$|After {{missions}} discovered <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> {{the harsh}} {{nature of the}} planet's surface, attention shifted towards other targets such as Mars. There {{have been a number}} of proposed missions afterwards however, and many of these involve the little-known upper atmosphere. The Soviet Vega program in 1985 dropped two balloons into the atmosphere, but these were battery-powered and lasted for only about two Earth days each before running out of power. Since then, there has been no exploration of the upper atmosphere. In 2002, the NASA contractor Global Aerospace proposed a balloon that would be capable of staying in the upper atmosphere for hundreds of Earth days as opposed to two.|$|E
