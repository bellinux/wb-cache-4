Army and Air Force planes delivered 20,000 Thanksgiving rations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> left in temporary shelters. The United States military also airlifted generators to Kauai due to {{several days of}} power outages. By {{three weeks after the}} hurricane, utility crews restored power to nearly all major areas in Oahu, while 5,000 remained without power in Kauai. By around a month after the hurricane passed the island, utilities were restored to most of the entire island. All roads and highways were cleared, as well. One 25th Infantry Division soldier at Schofield Barracks died while cleaning up after the hurricane. Two people died in a traffic accident due to malfunctioning traffic lights. Following the storm, significant redevelopment occurred in Poipu, where the hurricane flooded areas several hundred feet inland. Hurricane Iniki struck the same area ten years later. Officials estimate a hurricane similar to Iwa striking Oahu in 1992 could cause up to $7.5billion in damage (USD).|$|E

She published several further papers on this work which {{has become part of the}} mainstream of the physics and chemistry of coal. This work was covered in a 1993 monograph, and in the regularly-published textbook Chemistry and Physics of Carbon.
