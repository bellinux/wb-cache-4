5|$|They {{travelled}} with a Baedeker guidebook, but the {{two women}} soon became lost after missing the turn for the main avenue, Allée des Deux Trianons. <b>They</b> <b>passed</b> this road, and entered a lane, where unknown to them <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> their destination. Moberly noticed a woman shaking a white cloth out of a window and Jourdain noticed an old deserted farmhouse, outside of which was an old plough.|$|E
5|$|In October, the intermediate-range {{committee}} received {{copies of}} the FACT language specification created by Roy Nutt. Its features impressed the committee so much that <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> a resolution to base COBOL on it.|$|E
5|$|The extratropical {{remnants}} of Mitch continued {{quickly to the}} northeast. On November6, <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> north of Bermuda, and the following day intensified slightly to winds of 70mph (110km/h). By November9, the remnants passed west of the British Isles, and were last monitored by the NHC later that day.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Al-Furqan Sura (chapter) of the Qur'an, Muslims are {{to avoid}} such things and pay them no mind; [...] "... if <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> by some evil play or evil talk, <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> by it with dignity".|$|R

5|$|As {{flagship}} of Nishimura's Southern Force, Yamashiro left Brunei at 15:30 on 22 October 1944, heading east {{into the}} Sulu Sea {{and then to}} the northeast into the Mindanao Sea. Intending to join Vice-Admiral Takeo Kurita's force in Leyte Gulf, <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> west of Mindanao Island into Surigao Strait, where they met a large force of battleships and cruisers lying in wait. The Battle of Surigao Strait would become the southernmost action in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.|$|E
5|$|Both the Do 17s and Ju 88s of the III./KG 76 {{encountered}} flak as {{they crossed}} Dover. The Do 17s were escorted by ZG 26 while III./JG 51 led by Hannes Trautloft escorted the Ju 88s. The German bombers had flown east of Canterbury and thereby avoided the main concentration of fighters on the Canterbury-Margate line. At 13:01 <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> over Ashford and had a clear 65km (40 mile) run before they reached Biggin Hill and its four defending squadrons.|$|E
5|$|By November 1885, Adler had a {{theatrical}} club of his own, the Princes Street Club, No. 3 Princes Street (now Princelet Street, E1), purpose-built, financed by a butcher named David Smith. It seated 300; playing every night except Friday, he was earning about £3 s.10 a week, {{but with a}} fame well {{out of proportion to}} the meagre money. Many of the most prominent figures in Yiddish theater, including Sigmund Mogulesko, David Kessler, Abba and Clara Shoengold, and Sara Heine (the future Sara Adler), gave guest performances when <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through London.|$|E

5|$|Edmund was not {{particularly}} popular while he was alive, nor did he enjoy a good reputation after his death. His unreliability in political issues, and repeated shifts in allegiance, might have contributed to this. His household was also said to behave {{in a way that}} caused popular resentment, taking provisions as <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through the countryside while offering little compensation. At the same time, it has been pointed out that Edmund showed a great deal of loyalty to Edward II, in spite of receiving relatively little rewards and recognition from his brother.|$|E
5|$|Firing {{began at}} 15:29 when Prudente {{unleashed}} a close range broadside at Centurion, followed immediately by {{fire from the}} ships of both sides. Centurion was damaged in the opening exchanges and by 16:00 had most of her sails and rigging torn. At this Renaud ordered his squadron to pull back to leeward out of range, each firing on Centurion as <b>they</b> <b>passed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Here {{came the}} Rabbi, his back bent, his face shaved... His mere {{presence}} among the deportees added {{a touch of}} unreality to the scene. It was like a page torn from some story book... One by one <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> in front of me, teachers, friends, others, all those I had been afraid of, all those I once could have laughed at, all those I had lived with over the years. They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs.|$|E

5|$|Karthik had {{a chance}} to score heavily in India’s two-Test tour of Bangladesh in December 2004. Against a team that had never won a Test, India {{encountered}} little difficulty in sweeping the series, winning both matches by an innings. <b>They</b> <b>passed</b> 500 in both matches, but Karthik was unable to join the high-scoring, managing only 25 and 11.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, two Bristol Blenheims of No. 114 Squadron RAF made {{an attack}} on Frecamp and Dieppe, {{dropping}} bombs from high altitude. The Germans recorded no damage at Frecamp, and the attack on Dieppe seems to have gone unnoticed. As the bombers headed home, <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> two Spitfires of the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU). These high-speed aircraft had been stripped of non-essential weight such as armament and radios and were fitted with cameras and extra fuel tanks. They photographed ports and airfields and then returned.|$|E
5|$|On his death-bed, Josquin {{asked that}} he be listed on the rolls as a foreigner, so that his {{property}} would not pass to the Lords and Ladies of Condé. This bit of evidence {{has been used to}} show that he was French by birth. Additionally, he left an endowment for the performance of his late motet, Pater noster, at all general processions in the town when <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> in front of his house, stopping to place a wafer on the marketplace altar to the Holy Virgin. Pater noster may have been his last work.|$|E

5|$|The Aquaman {{pilot was}} {{expected}} to debut in the fall schedule of 2006, but following the merger of the WB and UPN, the resulting CW Network opted not to buy the series. After <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> on the pilot, it was made available online through iTunes in the United States and became the number-one most downloaded television show on iTunes. It received generally favorable reviews, was later released on other online markets, and aired on Canadian television network YTV.|$|E
5|$|The Indiana Sanitary Commission, {{created in}} 1862, and soldiers' aid {{societies}} {{throughout the state}} raised funds and gathered supplies for troops in the field.

5|$|The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade reached Debabis on 8 August. As the 3rd Light Horse Brigade came up, <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> many dead Ottomans and Yeomanry; one dead Ottoman sniper had {{a heap of}} {{hundreds}} of rounds of empty cartridge shells beside him. Meanwhile, the Bikanir Camel Corps and a squadron of aircraft continued searching the desert sands for missing men.|$|E

5|$|The flotilla's second {{success was}} the night of 19/20 December 1941, again in the North Sea off the Dutch coast, when two boats engaged two R boats and one E boat. <b>They</b> <b>passed</b> twice at high speed before losing contact, but twice during the night they located them and {{eventually}} carried out depth charge attacks. Both Hichens and {{the commander of the}} other boat received a MID for this action.|$|E
5|$|The new coins {{began to}} enter {{circulation}} in late 1965, and alleviated the shortages. <b>They</b> <b>passed</b> {{side by side}} with their silver counterparts for a time, but the precious metal coins were hoarded beginning in 1967 as the Treasury ended its efforts to keep silver prices low. The act also banned the production of silver dollars until at least 1970.|$|E
5|$|The trio {{explored}} {{the world around}} them, experiencing a second childhood with no wives, jobs, or responsibilities. <b>They</b> <b>passed</b> the time by speculating about their fellow townspeople and testing inventions. Regular subplots {{in the first decade}} of the show included: Sid and Ivy bickering over the management of the café, Mr Wainwright and Mrs Partridge having a secret love affair that everyone knows about, Wally trying to get away from Nora's watchful eye, Foggy's exaggerated war stories, and Compo's schemes to win the affections of Nora Batty.|$|E
50|$|Waves are {{disturbances}} {{that carry}} energy as they move. Mechanical waves propagate through a medium - air or water, making it oscillate as <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> by. Wind waves are surface waves that create the chaotic {{patterns of the}} sea. As <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> over sand, such waves create patterns of ripples; similarly, as the wind passes over sand, it creates patterns of dunes.|$|R
