5|$|In biology, Holliday {{junctions}} {{are a key}} intermediate in {{many types}} of genetic recombination, {{as well as in}} double-strand break repair. These junctions usually have a symmetrical sequence and are thus mobile, meaning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> individual arms may slide through the junction in a specific pattern that largely preserves base pairing. Additionally, four-arm junctions similar to Holliday junctions appear in some functional RNA molecules.|$|E
5|$|On January 7, 1610, Galileo wrote {{a letter}} {{containing}} the first mention of Jupiter's moons. At the time, he saw only three of them, and he believed them to be fixed stars near Jupiter. He continued to observe these celestial orbs from January 8 to March 2, 1610. In these observations, he discovered a fourth body, and also observed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> were not fixed stars, but rather were orbiting Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|According to Congress, {{the federal}} court for the Western District of Arkansas was to meet in four {{separate}} terms each year: in February, May, August, and November. The court had such a large caseload <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> terms ran together. Parker's court sat {{six days a week}} {{in order to ensure that}} they tried as many cases as possible each term, and often up to ten hours each day. In 1883, Congress reduced the jurisdiction of the court, reassigning parts of the Indian Territory to federal courts in Texas and Kansas; however, the increasing number of settlers moving into the Indian Territories actually increased the court's workload.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the debate}} at large traces its roots {{back to the}} end of World War II, the current debate began in 1992 with the {{retirement}} of the last active Iowa-class battleship, , {{as a result of the}} reduced demand for naval artillery, the rise of ship and submarine-launched missiles and aircraft-launched precision guided munitions (such as laser-guided bombs, which can accurately strike and destroy an enemy target with a single strike). The most striking point of the debate in the United States centers on battleships: owing to the longtime maintenance and upkeep <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> completed Iowa-class battleships have undergone during their time in the navy's active and mothball fleets, many still view battleships as viable solutions for gunfire support, and these members have questioned if the navy can adequately replace the gunfire support provided by a battleship's main guns with the smaller guns on its current fleet of cruisers and destroyers.|$|E

5|$|Another {{change in}} the 1370s was the {{formalisation}} {{of the process of}} guarding and maintaining the walls. During the invasion scare of 1377, Edward instructed the mayor to review these processes; it appears <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> wards of the town were surveyed, and each property was assigned a piece of the wall to maintain, varying according {{to the size of the}} property. For these purposes, the walls were measured out in units called loupes, or embrasures. The four wards were also responsible for the security and policing of the town.|$|E
5|$|Bhagavata Purana further {{states that}} Prithu {{performed}} ninety-nine ashwamedha yagnas (horse-sacrifices), but Indra, kings of the demi-gods, disturbed Prithu's hundredth one. The yagya was abandoned, Vishnu gave Prithu his blessings and Prithu forgave Indra for the latter's theft of the ritual-horse. It also states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> Kumaras, the four sage-incarnations of Vishnu, preached Prithu about devotion to Vishnu. After governing his kingdom {{for a long}} time, Prithu left with his wife Archi, to perform penance in the forest in his last days. He experienced Samadhi and voluntarily gave up his body in the forest, and Archi went Sati on his funeral pyre.|$|E
5|$|Following the uprising, {{prominent}} {{figures in}} Scranton began advocating {{for a permanent}} militia, and within a week nearly a thousand dollars were raised to this effect.

On August 23 a piece ran in The Scranton Republican announcing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> companies had been formed, and would muster on September 11 for inspection by the governor. In 1878 the Pennsylvania legislature organized the group as the Thirteenth Regiment, Third Brigade, Pennsylvania National Guard. The brigade went on to see action in three other major strikes.|$|E

5|$|For two years, Bahá'u'lláh {{lived alone}} in the {{mountains}} of Kurdistan. He originally lived as a hermit, dressed like a dervish and used the name Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani. At one point someone noticed his penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local Sufi orders. As he began to take guests, he became noted for his learning and wisdom. Shaykh `Uthmán, Shaykh `Abdu'r-Rahmán, and Shaykh Ismá'íl, leaders of the Naqshbandíyyih, Qádiríyyih, and Khálidíyyih Orders respectively, began to seek his advice. It was to the second of these <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> Valleys was written. Bahá'u'lláh wrote several other notable books during this time.|$|E
5|$|Iron Duke {{remained}} {{on active duty}} {{for only a few}} more years; in 1930, the London Naval Treaty specified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> Iron Duke-class battleships be scrapped or otherwise demilitarised. Iron Duke was therefore converted into a gunnery training ship; her armour and much of her armament was removed to render her unfit for combat. She served in this capacity until the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, when she was moored in Scapa Flow as a harbour defence ship. In October, she was badly damaged by German bombers and was run aground to avoid sinking. She continued to serve as an anti-aircraft platform {{for the duration of the}} war, and was eventually refloated and broken up for scrap in the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Maureen Hindley married David Smith on 15 August 1964. The {{marriage}} was hastily arranged and performed at a register office.

The next day, Brady suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> take a day-trip to Windermere. This {{was the first time}} Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour. The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank. The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine. The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings. Hindley was apparently jealous of their relationship, but became closer to her sister.|$|E

5|$|Seyfert's Sextet is a {{group of}} six galaxies, four of which are {{interacting}} gravitationally and two of which simply appear {{to be a part of}} the group despite their greater distance. The gravitationally bound cluster lies at a distance of 190 million light-years from Earth and is approximately 100,000 light-years across, making Seyfert's Sextet one of the densest galaxy group known. Astronomers predict <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> interacting galaxies will eventually merge to form a large elliptical galaxy. The radio source 3C 326 was originally though to emanate from a giant elliptical galaxy. However, in 1990, it was shown that the source is instead a brighter, smaller galaxy a few arcseconds north. This object, designated 3C 326 N, has enough gas for star formation, but is being inhibited due to the energy from the radio galaxy nucleus.|$|E
