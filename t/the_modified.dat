40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to explain the nuances of <b>the</b> <b>MODIFY</b> {{statement}} and <b>the</b> KEY = option, which is available for both <b>the</b> <b>MODIFY</b> statement and <b>the</b> SET statement. It assumes the reader has used <b>the</b> <b>MODIFY</b> and SET statements and has a general understanding of the KEY = option. The article begins with <b>the</b> <b>MODIFY</b> statement by explaining and comparing the different access methods, one of which uses the KEY = option. In addition, the article contains examples of how to monitor your updates and how to use MODIFY and KEY = to update like-named variables. Then the article goes into more detail regarding the KEY = option for both <b>the</b> <b>MODIFY</b> and SET statements.

When <b>the</b> <b>modifying</b> enzymes operate outside the region of first-order kinetics, small percentage changes in the concentration of the effector controlling either of <b>the</b> <b>modifying</b> enzymes can give much larger percentage changes in <b>the</b> amount of <b>modified</b> protein. This amplification of the response to a stimulus can provide additional sensitivity in biological control, equivalent to that of allosteric proteins with high Hill coefficients...|$|R
