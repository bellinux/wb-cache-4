5|$|Between 1900 and 1940, fishers were {{threatened}} with near-extinction {{in the southern}} part of their range due to overtrapping and alterations to their habitat. In New England, fishers, along with most other furbearers, were nearly exterminated due to unregulated trapping. Fishers became extirpated in many northern U.S. states after 1930, but were still abundant enough in Canada to maintain a harvest of over 3,000 fishers per year (see figure). Limited protection was afforded in the early 20th century, but it was not until 1934 that <b>total</b> <b>protection</b> was finally given to the few remaining fishers. Closed seasons, habitat recovery, and reintroductions have restored fishers to much of their original range.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTo predict risk after {{elective}} {{repair of}} ascending aorta and aortic arch aneurysms, we studied 464 consecutive patients. MethodsAdverse outcome (stroke or hospital death) was analyzed in 372 patients who underwent proximal repair and 92 patients who underwent aortic arch replacement from 1986 to the present. Preoperative risk factors with a P value less than. 2 in a univariate analysis {{were entered into}} a multivariate model, and an equation incorporating independent risk factors was derived separately for proximal aorta and arch surgery. ResultsAge more than 65 years (P =. 04), diabetes (P =. 02), cause (P =. 01), and prolonged <b>total</b> cerebral <b>protection</b> time (duration of hypothermic circulatory arrest and selective cerebral perfusion, P =. 001) were significant univariate risk factors for elective proximal aortic repair. Diabetes (P =. 005, odds ratio 5. 1), atherosclerosis (P =. 003, odds ratio 4. 0), and dissection (P =. 048, odds ratio 2. 5) were independent factors. For elective arch surgery, female sex (P =. 07), age more than 65 years (P =. 04), coronary artery disease (P =. 02), diabetes (P =. 06), cause (P =. 07), and prolonged <b>total</b> cerebral <b>protection</b> time (P =. 025) were univariate risk factors. Female sex (P =. 05, odds ratio 4. 7), coronary artery disease (P =. 02, odds ratio 6. 5), diabetes (P =. 13, odds ratio 4. 0), and <b>total</b> cerebral <b>protection</b> time (P =. 03, odds ratio 1. 02 /min) were independent factors. To calculate risk of adverse outcome (P), enter 1 if factor is present, 0 if absent, and estimate <b>total</b> cerebral <b>protection</b> time (in minutes). Pproximal aorta = { 1 + exp [3. 06 − 1. 62 (diabetes) − 1. 37 (atherosclerosis) − 0. 91 (dissection) ]}− 1 Paortic arch= { 1 + exp [4. 93 − 1. 55 (female) − 1. 87 (coronary artery disease) − 1. 38 (diabetes) − 0. 024 (<b>total</b> cerebral <b>protection</b> time) ]}− 1 ConclusionIn this large series of patients, the presence of diabetes and manifestations of atherosclerosis emerge as extremely important risk factors for adverse outcome after ascending aorta or arch surgery, displacing age.

40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{sought to}} assess the optimal {{strategy}} for avoiding neurologic injury after aortic operations requiring hypothermic circulatory arrest. Methods: All 717 patients who survived ascending aorta–aortic arch operations through a median sternotomy since 1986 were examined for factors influencing stroke. Temporary neurologic dysfunction was assessed in all patients who survived the operation without stroke since 1993. Multivariate analyses were carried out to determine independent risk factors for neurologic injury. Results: Independent risk factors for stroke were as follows: age greater than 60 years (P <. 001; odds ratio, 4. 5); emergency operation (P =. 02; odds ratio, 2. 2); new preoperative neurologic symptoms (P =. 05; odds ratio, 2. 9); presence of clot or atheroma (P <. 001; odds ratio, 4. 4); mitral valve replacement or other concomitant procedures (P =. 055; odds ratio, = 3. 7); and <b>total</b> cerebral <b>protection</b> time, defined as the sum of hypothermic circulatory arrest and any retrograde or antegrade cerebral perfusion (P =. 001; odds ratio, 1. 02 /min). In 453 patients surviving operations without stroke after 1993, independent risk factors for temporary neurologic dysfunction included age (P <. 001; odds ratio, 1. 06 /y), dissection (P =. 001; odds ratio, 2. 2), need for coronary artery bypass grafting (P =. 006; odds ratio, 2. 1) or other procedures (P =. 023; odds ratio, 3. 4), and <b>total</b> cerebral <b>protection</b> time (P <. 001; odds ratio, 1. 02 /min). When all patients with <b>total</b> cerebral <b>protection</b> times between 40 and 80 minutes were examined, the method of cerebral protection did not influence the occurrence of stroke, but antegrade cerebral perfusion resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} incidence on temporary neurologic dysfunction (P =. 05; odds ratio, 0. 3). Conclusions: The occurrence of stroke is principally determined by patient- and disease-related factors, but use of antegrade cerebral perfusion can significantly reduce the occurrence of temporary neurologic dysfunction.

This decision affects both the insurance class {{of the city and the}} total cost of fire <b>protection.</b> <b>Total</b> fire <b>protection</b> cost is the sum of the tax dollars spent for fire department services (public expenditures) and fire insurance premiums paid by residents and businesses (private expenditures). This paper presents an integer programming model to minimize the sum of these two costs. Since insurance costs reflect only property losses the model does not explicitly include the consequences of loss of life or injury. Since the protection of persons is an important part of the fire protection mission it is important to realize that the model produces a lower bound for the value and level of fire department services. We go on to show how the results can be used to provide a method of inputing a life hazard benefit for decisions which produce more fire protection than suggested by the cost-minimizing model. The model was applied in Boulder, Colorado; the ways in which the results may be incorporated into the political decision process are also described. planning: urban, programming: integer, applications, government: services, fire...|$|R
