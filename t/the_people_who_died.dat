25|$|The Twin Towers of the World Trade Center {{collapsed}} on September 11, 2001, {{as a result}} of being struck by two jet airliners hijacked by 10 terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda, during the September 11 attacks. Two of the four hijacked airliners crashed into the Twin Towers, one into the North Tower (1 World Trade Center) and the other into the South Tower (2 World Trade Center). The collapse of the Twin Towers destroyed the rest of the complex, and debris from the collapsing towers severely damaged or destroyed more than a dozen other adjacent and nearby structures. The South Tower collapsed at 9:59am, less than an hour after being hit by the second hijacked airliner, and at 10:28am the North Tower collapsed. Later that day, 7 World Trade Center collapsed at 5:21pm from fires that had started when the North Tower collapsed. As a result of the attacks to the towers, a total of 2,763 people died. Of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>died</b> in the towers, 2,192 were civilians, 343 were firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers.

500|$|The hip hop {{group the}} Beastie Boys made a music video for their song [...] "Gratitude" [...] {{that appears to}} be a homage to the film. Shot by David Perez in New Zealand, in {{addition}} to copying its directorial style of slow horizontal tracking shots, overhead shots of the drums, close up shots of the bass and multiple shots of guitar filling the screen, the video shows a number of speaker cabinets that the group managed to purchase, still labelled [...] "Pink Floyd, London". The video ends with a message that reads, [...] "This video is dedicated to the memory of all <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>died</b> at [...] Pompeii." [...] The Beastie Boys claimed in interviews that the song and the video came about from their desire to progress from being a straightforward hip hop group and add vintage instruments and old sound equipment to their repertoire.|$|E
500|$|In {{the other}} boats, {{there was nothing}} the {{survivors}} could do but await the arrival of rescue ships. The air was bitterly cold {{and several of the}} boats had taken on water. The survivors could not find any food or drinkable water in the boats, and most had no lights. The situation was particularly bad aboard collapsible B, which was only kept afloat by a diminishing air pocket in the upturned hull. As dawn approached, the wind rose and the sea became increasingly choppy, forcing those on the collapsible boat to stand up to balance it. Some, exhausted by the ordeal, fell off into the sea and were drowned. It became steadily harder for the rest to keep their balance on the hull, with waves washing across it. Archibald Gracie later wrote of how he and the other survivors sitting on the upturned hull were struck by [...] "the utter helplessness of our position." [...] Some swimmers who had reached collapsible A had not enough strength to come aboard, and had to cling to the boat's sides. The bodies of the majority of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>died</b> during the night were lowered into the sea to make more room for the survivors.|$|E
500|$|After {{filming the}} {{underwater}} shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay.

[...] "I read everything I could. I created an extremely detailed timeline of the ship's few days and a very detailed timeline of {{the last night of}} its life," [...] he said. [...] "And I worked within that to write the script, and I got some historical experts to analyze what I'd written and comment on it, and I adjusted it." [...] He paid meticulous attention to detail, even including a scene depicting the Californians role in Titanic demise, though this was later cut (see below). From the beginning of the shoot, they had [...] "a very clear picture" [...] of what happened on the ship that night. [...] "I had a library that filled one whole wall of my writing office with Titanic stuff, because I wanted it to be right, especially {{if we were going to}} dive to the ship," [...] he said. [...] "That set the bar higher in a way – it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you'd gone back in a time machine and shot it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The May 1998 riots of Indonesia (...) , {{also known}} as the [...] 1998 Tragedy (...) or simply the 1998 event (...) were {{incidents}} of mass violence, demonstrations, and civil unrest of a racial nature that occurred throughout Indonesia, mainly in Medan in the province of North Sumatra (4–8 May), the capital city of Jakarta (12–15 May), and Surakarta (also called Solo) in the province of Central Java (13–15 May).

The emperor's troops evacuated their fortified position at Inda Iyesus a few days later. However, the city was heavily bombed by British fighter jets {{under the command of}} the emperor, and this is believed to have deteriorated the morale of the rebels.
