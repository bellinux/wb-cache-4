5000|$|Sunshine {{duration}} {{follows a}} general geographic pattern: dry {{areas in the}} subtropical latitudes (about 25° to 40° north/south) have the highest sunshine values, because these are <b>the</b> locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subtropical high pressure systems, associated with the large-scale descent of air from the upper-level tropopause. Many of the world's driest climates are found adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subtropical highs, which create stable atmospheric conditions, little convective overturning, and little moisture and cloud cover. Desert regions, with nearly constant high pressure aloft and rare condensation—like North Africa, the Southwestern United States, Western Australia, and the Middle East—are examples of hot, sunny, dry climates where sunshine duration values are very high.|$|R
