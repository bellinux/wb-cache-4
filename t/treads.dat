5|$|On {{the inside}} of the tower there are 96 steps leading to the gallery in 4 stages, the first 3 of the same grade and the last stage a bit steeper and narrower. The {{staircase}} is made of concrete with slate <b>treads</b> and cast iron and brass balustrade.|$|E
5|$|The {{standards}} and balusters {{of the stairs}} {{on the north side}} of the hall came from Eversley Manor House and probably date to the mid-17th century, although the <b>treads</b> are original to the house and possibly mid-16th century. The walls above the stairs and on the first-floor landing contain some very large paintings, including several portraits.|$|E

50|$|The word <b>tread</b> {{is often}} used casually {{to refer to the}} pattern of grooves molded into the rubber, but those grooves are {{correctly}} called the <b>tread</b> pattern, or simply the pattern. The grooves are not the <b>tread,</b> they are in the <b>tread.</b> This distinction is especially significant in the case of racing slicks, which have a lot of <b>tread</b> but no grooves.|$|R
5|$|There {{is also a}} woodland, {{a former}} Forestry Commission plantation, planted around 1960 in the {{north-eastern}} corner of the park on a small hill, which contains a circular folly tower, of three storeys, in the centre. The tower, built from red sandstone, is believed to date to the late 18th century. The northern side is considerably more eroded by the weather than the southern side. The tower is marginally wider at the base and has no internal floor structure, but contains holes for floor joists and stair <b>treads.</b> There are four windows on the ground floors and narrower windows higher up.|$|E
5|$|Stanton wanted EVE {{to be at}} {{the higher}} end of technology, and asked iPod {{designer}} Jonathan Ive to inspect her design. He was very impressed. Her eyes are modelled on Lite-Brite toys, but Pixar chose not to make them overly expressive as it would be too easy to have her eyes turn into hearts to express love or something similar. Her limited design meant the animators had to treat her like a drawing, relying on posing her body to express emotion. They also found her similar to a manatee or a narwhal because her floating body resembled an underwater creature. Auto was a conscious homage to HAL 9000 from , and the usage of Also sprach Zarathustra for the showdown between the captain and Auto furthers that. The manner in which he hangs from a wall gives him a threatening feel, like a spider. Originally, Auto was designed entirely differently, resembling EVE, but masculine and authoritative; the Steward robots were also more aggressive Patrol-bots. The majority of the robot cast were formed with the Build-a-bot program, where different heads, arms and <b>treads</b> were combined together in over a hundred variations. The humans were modelled on sea lions due to their blubbery bodies, as well as babies. The filmmakers noticed baby fat is a lot tighter than adult fat and copied that texture for the film's humans.|$|E

25|$|Caterpillar <b>treads</b> were used, {{with rubber}} bushed pins. The {{width of the}} tracks were 533mm or 610mm. The number of tracks in a tread was 80 {{and the length of}} the bearing surface was 4.2 m.|$|E

25|$|Before about 1960, most railway {{vehicles}} used {{brake shoes}} {{to stop the}} train by applying pressure on the wheel <b>treads.</b> Since then, disc brakes have increasingly been used, which means that cleaning the compressed leaf material from the wheel tread by abrasion no longer occurs.|$|E
5000|$|A non-zero {{slip angle}} arises because of {{deformation}} in the tire carcass and <b>tread.</b> As the tire rotates, the {{friction between the}} contact patch and the road results in individual <b>tread</b> 'elements' (finite sections of <b>tread)</b> remaining stationary {{with respect to the}} road. If a side-slip velocity u is introduced, the contact patch will be deformed. When a <b>tread</b> element enters the contact patch, the friction between the road and the tire causes the <b>tread</b> element to remain stationary, yet the tire continues to move laterally. Thus the <b>tread</b> element will be ‘deflected’ sideways. While it is equally valid to frame this as the tire/wheel being deflected away from the stationary <b>tread</b> element, convention is for the co-ordinate system to be fixed around the wheel mid-plane.|$|R

Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{the upper}} level {{received}} a major overhaul before the Bridge level reopened.

25|$|Metro's board {{awarded a}} $41.5 million {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} the Anacostia station to Kiewit Construction Co. in June 1985, and said the station would open in 1990. Ground was broken at the site on September 21, 1985. A significant number of prehistoric artifacts were found during the station's excavation. Rubble from the station's construction was dumped {{on the south side of}} Good Hope Road SE between 24th Street SE and Altamont Place SE (where the Woodmont Crossing housing project was built in 2002). Exit 3B (Howard Road) on southbound I-295 was closed to construct Anacostia station, blocking traffic from reaching South Capitol Street. Although above-ground construction ended in late 1989, the exit remained closed until December 1991 so that its reopening would coincide with the Anacostia station opening. In July 1991, Metro paid an additional $1 million to install stronger escalator <b>treads</b> at the nine planned Green Line stations (including Anacostia) as well as the Wheaton and Van Dorn Street stations after discovering that the escalator <b>treads</b> it had ordered were insufficiently strong.|$|E
25|$|The mainstaircase was {{flanked by}} smooth, {{variegated}} marble columns in antis. Ten marble steps {{lead up to}} a landing. In the east wall of the intermediate landing is a fountain. The stairs diverge at the intermediate landing, with nine more steps on {{the north and south}} leading to the second floor landing. The stringer, risers, and <b>treads</b> are all made of marble.
