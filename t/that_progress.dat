5|$|The league {{operates}} on three tiers – two Premier divisions (North and South) with 6 regional conferences {{in the lower}} two tiers – with most teams from the two Premier divisions competing in postseason Championship playoffs. A system of promotion and relegation is used between the three tiers.

5|$|Development of Jedi Knight {{was led by}} Justin Chin, who {{had also}} worked on the {{previous}} game. The most significant developments for Jedi Knight are the use of The Force and the lightsaber. The Force plays an integral role in how the player plays the game and shapes the way the game is played. The method of allocating credits to Force powers was designed with a role-playing video game style in mind, allowing the player the choice of which powers to improve. Chin said in an early interview <b>that</b> <b>progress</b> in the game {{is based upon the}} abilities the player develops.|$|E

5|$|Kreml, {{named after}} the Kremlin, was ordered on 20 April 1863 when a {{contract}} was signed with the Russian shipbuilder Semiannikov & Poletika for a total cost of 898,000 rubles. Construction had not yet begun when the Russian Admiralty Board amended the contract on 20 July to shorten the construction time by one year for a payment of an extra 48,000 rubles {{in response to the}} adverse foreign reaction to the brutal Russian suppression of the revolts in Poland and Lithuania that year. Fearing attack by Britain and France, the Board switched priority to the smaller s shortly afterwards in the belief that they could be completed more quickly so <b>that</b> <b>progress</b> on Kreml slowed to a crawl once construction began on 2 October. The ship was not formally laid down until 23 December and she was launched on 26 August 1865.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the lack}} of funds and unwillingness {{on the part of}} the council to commit to regeneration, by 1985 it {{appeared}} <b>that</b> <b>progress</b> was being made in solving the area's problems. Pressure from the Tenants' Association and the Youth Association forced the council to open a Neighbourhood Office. In 1983, a tenants' empowerment agency, Priority Estates Project, was appointed to coordinate residents' complaints and concerns, and residents were included on interview panels for council staff dealing with the area.|$|E
25|$|The 2006–2008 project {{repeatedly}} {{increased in}} cost, from NZ$23million to around NZ$43.5million, with some aspects (such as an improved entrance to Myers Park) falling {{victim to the}} blowout. While Council noted in June 2007 <b>that</b> <b>progress</b> had often been quicker than expected, the cost overruns, and the long duration of the construction works – which substantially affected pedestrian and motor vehicle traffic as well as retail sales – made the upgrade unpopular in public, at least during the duration. It also became a problem issue for Dick Hubbard in his failed campaign for re-election to Mayor of Auckland in 2007.|$|E

Agreed estimates of abundance could not be developed and preliminary estimates may only reflect major changes in abundance over a long time line. Problems were identified with age and mortality rate data. Krill-related work was welcomed but relatively little progress was made toward understanding the role of whales in the Antarctic ecosystem. Data on pollution was also welcomed but disagreement continued over the interpretation of the results. Levels of toxic pollutants were lower in Antarctic whales than those sampled in the Northern hemisphere.|$|E

Much of <b>that</b> <b>progress</b> was down to tyre development from Bridgestone coupled with significant improvements in aerodynamics and handling (overseen by Simon Phillips and Richard Frith respectively).

25|$|On 5 June 2014 it was {{announced}} that one of Scotland's top criminal lawyers Aamer Anwar was instructed by immediate members of Al-Megrahi's family. Although Al-Megrahi had died from cancer following his compassionate release from prison an application was still being lodged with the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission seeking to review his case and return it to the appeal court as a miscarriage of justice. Aamer Anwar was also instructed by 24 British relatives of passengers who died on the flight including Dr. Jim Swire. In December 2014 Frank Mulholland, the Lord Advocate (Scotland's senior law officer), restated his belief that al-Megrahi had been guilty of the bombing and that he was hopeful <b>that</b> <b>progress</b> might be made in the continuing investigation to find al-Megrahi's accomplices.|$|E
25|$|In London, {{he joined}} a small trade union, the Progressive Society of Carpenters and Joiners, {{to which he was}} elected {{secretary}} in 1854, and chairman in 1858. He believed <b>that</b> <b>progress</b> could be made if all trade unions representing the building trades were united in one society, so in 1859 organised the Building Trades Conference. At the conference, the unions agreed to demand a maximum working day of nine hours from their employers. The employers refused, resulting in strike action and a lockout. Eventually the unions conceded, but due to his actions Potter became a prominent figure in the New Model Unions movement. He was regarded as a more intellectual, 'respectable' trade unionist, due in part to his smart appearance and restrained public speaking style. He was made an executive member of the London Trades Council (LTC).|$|E
