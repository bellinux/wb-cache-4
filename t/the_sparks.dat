5|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} by Gaga in a similar choreography at the thirty-fifth season of NBC's late night comedy show Saturday Night Live. It was also present on the set list of Gaga's The Monster Ball Tour. She wore multiple donned braided extensions and was perched atop a railing. From each of her braids, a dancer was attached on the stage. A backdrop of stars were shown during the performance. During the revised shows of The Monster Ball, Gaga changed the concept {{and the performance of}} the song. She wore an emerald green dress by Thierry Mugler, and was attacked by a giant, mechanical Angler fish. Gaga then removed the dress to reveal a leotard of the same color and during the bridge she is lowered beneath the stage to acquire her pyro-technic bra. In the final chorus of the song Gaga returns and kills the monster with <b>the</b> <b>sparks</b> from the bra.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after passing}} the {{accident}} site at Parkside, the train passed {{a group of}} uniformed men walking along the railway carrying a variety of objects. It later transpired {{that this was the}} band, who had left their wagon when it had been commandeered to carry the injured Huskisson. The train which had carried the Duke of Wellington to Roby had not had space for them, and had left them to wait for the other trains which they believed were following. The band had eventually given up waiting and walked home, along a grass verge that was turning to mud under the heavy rain. As the train passed Sutton the three engines were unable to haul the combined weight of the train up an incline, and 400 of the men aboard were obliged {{to get out of the}} train and walk for a mile, illuminated only by <b>the</b> <b>sparks</b> flying from the locomotives, as the engines slowly hauled the empty carriages up the gradient. The train finally arrived in Liverpool at 10.30pm. Many of the guests had planned to return home in daylight following the completion of the journey, and set out into the pitch-black city in search of somewhere to sleep.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Formation {{mechanism}} of <b>the</b> micro-arc oxidation <b>spark</b> discharge {{is always a}} research problem; so far there isn’t a theoretical model for analyzing <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> discharge formation which is widely recognized. Based on analyzing the reaction phenomena and the coating feature in the different periods of <b>the</b> red <b>spark</b> discharge, <b>the</b> formation model of <b>the</b> red <b>spark</b> discharge was established. <b>The</b> <b>spark</b> discharge formation mechanism is shown that it causes <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> discharge formation that the electron bombards the gas layer wrapping the coating in the infancy of red spark discharge stage; at the later period the area of strong electric field generates <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> discharge where <b>the</b> coating of excessive polarization turns out easily...|$|R
25|$|A {{bench grinder}} is usually {{used to create}} <b>the</b> <b>sparks,</b> but {{sometimes}} this is not convenient, so a portable grinder is used. In either case, the grinding wheel must have adequate surface velocity, at least 23m/s (4500surface feet per minute (sfpm)), but should be between 38 and 58m/s (7500–11,500sfpm). The wheel should be coarse and hard, therefore aluminium oxide or carborundum often are employed. The test area should be {{in an area where}} there is no bright light shining directly into the observer's eyes. Moreover, the grinding wheel and surrounding area should be dark so that <b>the</b> <b>sparks</b> can be observed clearly. The test sample is then touched lightly to the grinding wheel to produce <b>the</b> <b>sparks.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{practical}} use, a V-6 engine {{would only}} need three coil packs instead of six.

40|$|Previous works {{employed}} pressure-based {{heat release}} analysis, spark-discharge current/voltage measurements, and cycle-resolved combustion imaging to identify four periods of stratified-charge spark-assisted compression ignition: spark discharge, early kernel growth (EKG), flame propagation, and compression ignition. While {{it was found}} that variability in the EKG, and not <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> discharge, influenced combustion phasing, the influence of <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> discharge on <b>the</b> EKG could not be assessed because the imaging system was incapable of recording both <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> discharge and <b>the</b> flame development from the same cycle. This limitation has been overcome here by recording images of both <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> discharge and combustion chemiluminescence during each engine cycle. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> discharge plasmas were recorded from two nearly-orthogonal views to assure that out-of-plane excursions were measured; such are not available from a single view. The results in this study demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> discharge event was not deterministic of the EKG. Circumstantial evidence is given to suggest that the fuel/air distribution and velocity at <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> plug dominate <b>the</b> EKG period variability, though this could not be confirmed definitively...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of triple GEM detector setups {{in an environment}} of high energetic showers is studied. To this end <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> probability in a shower environment is compared to <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> probability in a pion beam. The triple GEM detectors for the CBM muon chamber (MuCh) will be operated in a high rate environment of heavily ionizing particles due to the presence of thick iron absorber in the system. Therefore, the {{stability of}} the detectors needs to be tested. In a dedicated beam time double mask triple GEM detectors have been tested at CERN SPS/H 4. In this study pion beam of ~ 150 GeV/c has been used. Different methods to determine <b>the</b> <b>spark</b> has been described in this paper.

25|$|The wheellock took {{around a}} minute to load, prepare and fire.
