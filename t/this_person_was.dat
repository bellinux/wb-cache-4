5|$|Cape Verde was {{represented}} by one athlete at the 2008 Olympics in athletics. <b>This</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> Nelson Cruz a marathon runner. It was Cruz's Olympic debut but he had competed in two IAAF World Championships, in 2005 and in 2007. He competed on the 24 August in Beijing, and finished 48th out of 95 {{in a time of}} 2hours, 23minutes and 47seconds, more than 17minutes behind the winner, Samuel Kamau Wanjiru.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} for certain who the {{causeway}} is named after, but the figure was at the latest pre-Renaissance, {{and the majority of}} sources agree that it has its origins in the medieval period or earlier. The name Wade appears {{as one of the most}} common surnames in a 1381 poll tax register from Suffolk, and philologist P H Reaney reports multiple instances of it from the 11th and 12th centuries. The names Wade or Wada were common in pre-medieval English history and historian William Searle records around a dozen historic Wades in his Onomasticon of early Anglo-Saxon names. The earliest figure from the region identified as Wade in extant writings is Duke Wada, a historical personage of Saxon descent who is recorded in 1083 as having been a prominent figure living in the Yorkshire area around 798. It is possible that <b>this</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> either named after—or has been conflated over time with—one of several earlier, mythological figures known as Wade. Chadwick states that it is most probable that the causeway is named directly after a well-known mythological, rather than historical, Wada.|$|E

25|$|Controversy over Omari's {{identity}} erupted {{shortly after}} the attacks. At first, the FBI had named Abdul Rahman al-Omari, a pilot for Saudi Arabian Airlines, as the pilot of Flight 11. It was quickly shown that <b>this</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> still alive, and the FBI issued an apology. It was also quickly determined that Mohamed Atta was the pilot among the hijackers. The FBI then named Abdulaziz al-Omari as a hijacker.|$|E
25|$|After President Sinibaldi Castro resignation, the Guatemalan Assembly {{named the}} second presidential {{designate}} as interim President. <b>This</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> general Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián, who arrived to Guatemala City when general Barrios was {{being put to}} rest and demanded to general Barrundia —Secretary of War and main candidate to get the presidency after Sinibaldi's resignation— to be appointed president, and that he needed room and board {{for the thousands of}} troops that he had brought along and were waiting {{on the outskirts of the}} city. Barillas was governor of Quetzaltenango. The troops did not exist, but Barrundia did not know that and by the time he realized he had been taken, Barillas had been sworn as interim President.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth kept {{a female}} {{companion}} with her {{most of the}} time. <b>This</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> not exactly a servant, but she would act in that role. She {{would be expected to}} carry things and aid Elizabeth on her daily round. Barbara Schnorrenberg suggests that Sarah Scott was in this function and says that {{there is good reason to}} suggest that she married poorly to escape that situation (Schnorrenberg 723). After Elizabeth's mother died, her father moved to London with his housekeeper, giving no money at all to his children. When Sarah was removed from her bad marriage, Elizabeth's father (whose ward she was) not only gave her no financial help but forbade either Elizabeth or Matthew, her brother, from relieving her distress.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Tavis Morello , an Eagle Scout, {{and staff}} member working at Yawgoog Scout Reservation {{was fired for}} admitting he was gay to Scouting Official Gary Savignano, who then {{proceeded}} to confiscated Morello's Eagle Scout card. Director of the Narragansett Council at the time, Lyle Antonides, defended the action stating that “I think this young man is {{just trying to get}} a headline.” In response to the firing of their fellow staff member, {{the vast majority of the}} Reservations staff staged a sit-in as a sign of support, causing the camp to shut down. Following this, GLAD and the Rhode Island affiliate of the ACLU looked into the situation. ACLU Executive Director Steven Brown is quoted as saying, “Based on the information I’ve heard, <b>this</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> terminated because he acknowledged he was gay. And that’s illegal.” Due to mounting legal pressures and increasing amounts of negative publicity, by the end of the camping season, the Narragansett Council had reversed its decision and offered to reinstate Morello, both as an employee and as an Eagle Scout.|$|E
25|$|There are early {{hints that}} Seishirō {{may not be}} all that he appears. Hokuto jokes about him {{being a member of}} the family of Sakurazukamori, a clan of assassins who use onmyōjitsu to kill, and are {{pronounced}} to be the Sumeragis' opposite. Also, Subaru has dreams about having met someone under a cherry tree blooming out of season when he was but a small child, but he cannot quite recall what was being said. <b>This</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> actually Seishirō, upon whom Subaru stumbled when he had just performed a kill. According to the rules of the Sakurazukamori, Seishirō should have killed him, but impressed with the child's purity, he made a bet with him instead: He would meet Subaru again, and would then spend one year with him, protecting him and trying to love him. If, at the end of that year, he felt something for Subaru which distinguished him from a thing he could easily destroy, as he could not with any other person, then he would not kill him. To recognize him, he marked him with inverted pentagrams on both hands, the sign of the Sakurazukamori's prey. These marks are for most of the story hidden beneath the gloves Subaru continually wears on the direction of his grandmother, the previous family head, who recognized the marks and so hopes to conceal them with her magic.|$|E
25|$|On July 31 at Verano de Escándalo, Park faced La Sociedad stablemate and new AAA Mega Champion Jeff Jarrett and Dr. Wagner, Jr. in a {{three-way}} {{match for the}} title, with Konnan stating that Park's job was {{to ensure that the}} title stayed with Jarrett. After Wagner, Jr. was eliminated from the match, Jarrett pinned Park to retain his title, when someone masked as El Zorro interfered and hit him with a guitar. <b>This</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> later revealed as La Sociedad member Chessman, whom Konnan had sent to interfere in the match in order to have Park go after El Zorro instead of continuing to chase his stablemate's title. On October 9 at Héroes Inmortales, Park took part in the Copa Antonio Peña gauntlet match. After turning on Jeff Jarrett and eliminating him from the match, Park was once again attacked by a masked El Zorro, which led to Electroshock defeating him to win the match. Héroes Inmortales also saw La Parka turning on AAA and joining La Sociedad, which led to him and L.A. Park forming an unlikely tag team on December 1, when they defeated the team of Dr. Wagner, Jr. and Electroshock in the main event. On December 16 at Guerra de Titanes, Park defeated Dr. Wagner, Jr. for the AAA Latin American Championship. The rivalry between Park and Jeff Jarrett continued on March 18, 2012, at Rey de Reyes, where Jarrett's interference eliminated Park from the Rey de Reyes tournament. During the main event of the evening, Park in turn cost Jarrett the AAA Mega Championship in his match against El Mesías.|$|E

25|$|In February 2010, TNA {{restarted}} {{their working}} relationship with AAA and in early May 2011, Jarrett made his return to AAA television, announcing his and TNA's alignment with Dorian Roldán and his heel stable La Sociedad and their participation in Triplemanía XIX. Konnan, the co-leader of La Sociedad and former TNA worker, however, was against the idea of his former employer coming to AAA and believed that Roldán {{had made a mistake}} by inviting him to the promotion. Jarrett and Abyss arrived to AAA on May 18 for a confrontation with Konnan and La Sociedad. In the end, Jarrett and Konnan revealed that they were in fact on the same page with each other and turned on AAA Mega Champion El Zorro with Konnan announcing that Jarrett would be challenging for his title at Triplemanía XIX. On June 18 at Triplemanía XIX, Jarrett defeated El Zorro to become the new AAA Mega Champion. On July 31 at Verano de Escándalo, Jarrett successfully defended the title in a three-way elimination match against Dr. Wagner, Jr. and L.A. Park, when someone wearing El Zorro's old mask interfered and hit Park with a guitar. <b>This</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> later revealed as La Sociedad member Chessman, whom Konnan had sent to interfere in the match in order to have Park go after El Zorro instead of continuing to chase his stablemate's title. The storyline continued on October 9 at Héroes Inmortales, where both Jarrett and Park took part in the Copa Antonio Peña gauntlet match. After working together for the entire match, Park eventually turned on Jarrett and eliminated him. After a distraction from the Jarretts, Park was attacked by another masked El Zorro, costing him the match.|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, Lucy Lawless was {{revealed}} {{to be involved in}} the second season. At the San Diego Comic Con 2014, Lawless' role {{was revealed}} to be that of Isabelle Hartley, a longtime S.H.I.E.L.D. veteran. About the decision to cast Lawless as Hartley, who was always intended to be killed off at the end of the episode, Whedon said [...] "We wanted you to invest in the character and feel like <b>this</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> a real equal to Coulson.

500|$|Saari also posted another {{video on}} a Finnish social {{networking}} site, {{in which he}} pointed a gun at the camera and said in English [...] "You will die next", followed by firing four shots {{in the direction of}} the camera.

It was only afterwards that much more information came out." [...] Police said that Saari would have been detained if they had known about this video at the time of the questioning. Police said that they believed Saari's videos were shot by someone else, and that they were trying to identify who <b>this</b> <b>person</b> <b>was.</b> The Chief Investigator of the case, Jari Neulaniemi, speculated that the cameraman may have been the friend of Saari's who was murdered.|$|E

500|$|At the Coroner's Inquest {{into the}} death of the Princess, on 13 February 2008, {{speaking}} by video-link from France, Tomlinson conceded that, after the interval of 16 or 17 years, he [...] "could not remember specifically" [...] whether the document he had seen during 1992 had in fact proposed the use of a strobe light to cause a traffic accident as a means of assassinating Milošević, although use of lights for this purpose had been covered in his MI6 training. On being told that no MI6 file on Henri Paul had been found, Tomlinson said that it [...] "would be absurd after 17 years to say I can positively disagree with it, but...

500|$|The BBC {{radio show}} Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh, first {{broadcast}} in 1944, is sometimes stated in newspaper reports to have popularised the term [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] for correspondence to newspapers. There were also suggestions {{that the use}} of [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] came from one regular contributor of letters to The Times in the early 20th century, who would use a particular style of writing to oppose people and organisations who came to his attention. Despite being described as the [...] "quintessential Englishman" [...] and having his letters regularly published, his identity was never known because he would only identify himself as [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells". However, some reports have popularly rumoured that <b>this</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> a retired colonel who served in the British Indian Army during the British Raj. In 2014, the Kent and Sussex Courier claimed that the originator of [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] was the retired British Army colonel George Thomas Howe, who had developed a skill for letter writing after five years of observing apartheid in the Union of South Africa. Reportedly, his letters were popular reading and helped to sell newspapers that published them.|$|E
