5|$|Eventually Henderson leased two {{properties}} in Essex Street for £250 per year, {{at the site}} of the modern-day Esplanade Hotel. He used his convicts to convert the buildings into a temporary prison. Meanwhile, Henderson was looking for a site to build a permanent convict establishment. Whilst he favoured Mount Eliza due to its height, which gave it pleasing vistas and supposedly healthier air, Governor Charles Fitzgerald rejected <b>that</b> <b>proposal.</b> Henderson ultimately settled on the current site on a hill overlooking Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|In Tucson between April 2 and April 5, 1860, a {{convention}} of settlers from the southern half of the New Mexico Territory drafted a constitution for a provisional Arizona Territory, three years before the United States would create such a territory. This proposed territory consisted of the part of New Mexico Territory south of 33° 40' N. On April 2, they elected a governor, Lewis Owings. The provisional territory was to exist {{until such time as}} an official territory was created, but <b>that</b> <b>proposal</b> was rejected by the U.S. Congress at the time.|$|E

The ACLU directors rejected <b>that</b> <b>proposal.</b> Other ACLU members wanted the ACLU to shift focus into the political arena, and to {{be more willing to}} compromise their ideals in order to strike deals with politicians. This initiative was also rejected by the ACLU leadership.|$|E
5|$|The NCTA's November 1962 Transportation in the National Capital Region report {{included}} {{a proposal for}} an 89-mile (143km), $793 million rail system. The {{total cost of the}} proposed highway and rail system was less than the 1959 plan due to the elimination of controversial freeways. The plan was supported by President Kennedy, but opposed by highway advocates in Congress who reduced the rail system to only 23-miles (37km) within the District of Columbia. However, <b>that</b> <b>proposal</b> was defeated in Congress shortly after President Kennedy's death. The Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 passed Congress, which promised 66% federal funding for urban mass transportation projects. Encouraged by the new act, the NCTA recommended the formation of a private entity or a multi-state authority to operate the system using more non-federal funds. On September 8, 1965, President Johnson signed the National Capital Transportation Act of 1965 approving the construction of a 25-mile (40km) rapid transit system.|$|E
5|$|The {{educational}} opportunities for secondary modern pupils were limited compared to those at grammar schools, prompting criticism of the Tripartite system. In 1965, the Labour Government issued Circular 10/65 requesting Local Education Authorities implement comprehensive schooling. In 1971 Sleaford parents voted in favour of comprehensive education, but rejected the Council's proposals. A new plan which envisaged Carre's becoming a sixth form college was supported by parents in a vote (1,199 to 628), albeit with a 50% turnout; the County Council approved it but allowed governors a veto. Following negotiations with governors at Carre's, the scheme was revised so that Carre's would be an 11–18 school and adsorb Sleaford Secondary Modern's Church Lane site. Despite support from most staff and all three headteachers, Lincolnshire County Council voted to return the scheme for consultation in 1975. A new system was proposed which retained all three schools, and when the Government ordered the Council to choose a comprehensive scheme in 1977 it submitted <b>that</b> <b>proposal,</b> which had become popular with parents. The next year the government dismissed it on grounds that the Sixth Forms would be too small, but the council voted against the two-school system once more.|$|E

5|$|Mariano Moreno {{had several}} {{contacts}} with groups seeking {{the removal of}} Cisneros, but was not strongly involved with the May Revolution, which considered {{the fall of the}} Junta of Seville a reason to depose the viceroy and create a local junta. At the time, Moreno was still loyal to Álzaga. He attended the May 22 open Cabildo, but according to the father of Vicente Fidel López and the father-in-law of Bartolomé Mitre (both direct witness) he stayed silent at one side and did not join the debate. He voted for Saavedra's proposal: to remove viceroy Cisneros and replace him with a Junta. Manuel Hermenegildo Aguirre, captain of hussars, proposed that the Cabildo take the reins of government, with five men appointed as counselors, Moreno among them. However, nobody else voted for <b>that</b> <b>proposal,</b> and it {{was the only one that}} included him. Moreno felt betrayed when the Cabildo twisted the results of the open Cabildo and created a Junta that would be headed by Cisneros. He refused any further contacts with the revolutionaries and stayed home during the remaining events. The definitive members of the Junta came from a popular petition signed on May 25, which was given to the Cabildo. The reasons of Moreno's inclusion in the list are unclear, as with all other members of the Junta. A commonly accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists.|$|E
5|$|With Interstate funding assured, MDSHA {{commissioned}} the Baltimore–Annapolis Transportation Corridor Study in 1973 to figure out, among other things, the best route for the Baltimore–Annapolis Interstate. The study discovered a western route following the MD 3 and MD 178 corridors {{would be less}} disruptive and require fewer acquisitions of homes and businesses compared to {{an extension of the}} Arundel Expressway south along the MD 2 corridor. In June 1979, MDSHA announced plans for I-97. The original route numbering plan, which was approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) at its November 1975 meeting, was for I-97 to include its current route plus US 50 from Parole west to I-95 (Capital Beltway). <b>That</b> <b>proposal</b> included two auxiliary Interstate highways. I-197 would follow US 50 and US 301 east from I-97 to just west of the Severn River. I-297 would follow MD 3 between a pair of intersections with I-97 in Millersville and Bowie. AASHTO rescinded its approval of the 1975 plan at its June 1981 meeting, then approved what was essentially the original 1975 plan at its June 1982 meeting. The east–west segment of I-97 and I-197 was replaced by I-68. I-297 was withdrawn by request of the state of Maryland in 1983. The 1982 concept of I-68 became unsigned I-595 and I-68 was applied to the National Freeway in Western Maryland in 1991 after AASHTO approved the new designations at its June 1989 meeting.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} proposals for a railway to Doncaster was in 1890, and involved {{an extension of the}} Kew branch line in a tunnel under the High Street hill, then across the route of Outer Circle line to a terminus at Warrandyte, with a branch line running to Templestowe. In 1928 the Railways Standing Committee of the Victorian Parliament recommended a plan which also involved an extension of the Kew branch line, this time to terminate at Doncaster itself. <b>That</b> <b>proposal</b> was included in the Metropolitan Town Planning Commission's 1929 plan for Melbourne, together with the Glen Waverley railway line, which was subsequently constructed.|$|E
25|$|From its 1823 inception, the new {{federation}} (the United Provinces of Central America) faced {{a series}} of ultimately unresolvable problems. Instead of engendering a spirit of unity, Spanish rule had fostered divisions and local suspicions. In the case of Honduras, this divisiveness was epitomized by the rivalry between Tegucigalpa and Comayagua. There was even some sentiment for admitting these two cities as separate provinces within the federation, but <b>that</b> <b>proposal</b> was ultimately rejected. In addition, much of the region was suspicious of Guatemalan ambitions to dominate Central America and wished to retain all possible local authority rather than surrender any to a central government.|$|E

The National Constitution established the State with responsibility and obligation to regulate the handling of natural resources. The Civil Code recognizes water resources as a public good and this is subject to the rules that also govern the private ownership of land. The Code states that the consumption of water for irrigation purposes is not regulated and the extraction of groundwater is free.

25|$|Turner then {{served as}} Minister of Finance from 1972 until 1975. His {{challenges}} were severe {{in the face}} of global financial issues such as the explosive increase in the price of oil, collapse of the postwar trading system, slowing economic growth, soaring inflation, and growing deficits. His positions were more conservative than Trudeau's and they drew apart. In 1975 Turner surprisingly resigned from cabinet, reportedly due to personality conflicts with Trudeau. The Liberals had won the 1974 election by attacking Robert Stanfield's Progressive Conservatives over their platform involving wage and price controls. However, Trudeau decided to implement the wage and price controls in late 1975, so some have suggested that Turner quit rather than carry out <b>that</b> <b>proposal.</b> In a 2013 interview with Catherine Clark on CPAC Turner confirmed his resignation from cabinet was a direct result of refusing to implement wage and price controls, after campaigning against them in 1974.|$|E
25|$|At the Eighth Session, {{which took}} place on Friday 10 May, a {{proposal}} was introduced to ratify the amalgamation of the two colleges of cardinals.

The Bishop of Salisbury, Robert Hallam, made the fatuous objection that the cardinals of Gregory XII had formally withdrawn their obedience, whereas the cardinals of Benedict XIII had not done so, placing the two colleges on a different footing. Then it was proposed that a decree be issued that it was lawful, as well as the duty, for everyone to withdraw from both popes. Several cardinals objected to <b>that</b> <b>proposal,</b> but the Council voted in favor anyway.
