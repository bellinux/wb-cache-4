The wind-driven wavy gas-liquid interface is captured using an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method with boundary-fitted coordinates on moving grids. The results show that Langmuir circulations are generated on the liquid side below the sheared wind-driven gas-liquid interface. The marker particles on the gas-liquid interface, the <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddies</b> in the form of streamwise vortices on the liquid side (i. e., the typical horseshoe vortices associated with bursting motions), and the low scalar flux lines on the gas-liquid interface induced by the <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddies</b> on the liquid side tend to locally concentrate in the regions along the downward flows caused by the Langmuir circulations.

50|$|The world's oceans {{are made}} up of many {{different}} water masses. Each have particular temperature and salinity characteristics {{as a result of the}} location in which they formed. Once formed at a particular source, a water mass will travel some distance via large-scale ocean circulation. Typically, the flow of water in the ocean is described as turbulent (i.e. it doesn't follow straight lines). Water masses can travel across the ocean as <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddies,</b> or parcels of water usually along constant density (isopycnic) surfaces where the expenditure of energy is smallest. When these <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddies</b> of different water masses interact, they will mix together. With enough mixing, some stable equilibrium is reached and a mixed layer is formed. <b>Turbulent</b> <b>eddies</b> can also be produced from wind stress by the atmosphere on the ocean. This kind of interaction and mixing through buoyancy at the surface of the ocean also plays a role in the formation of a surface mixed layer.|$|R

40|$|A multiple-scale {{model for}} {{compressible}} turbulent flows is proposed. It {{is assumed that}} <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddy</b> shocklets are formed primarily by the 'collisions' of large energetic eddies. The extra straining of the large eddy, due to their interactions with shocklets, enhances the energy cascade to smaller eddies. Model transport equations are developed for the turbulent kinetic energies and the energy transfer rates of the different scale. The <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddy</b> viscosity {{is determined by the}} total turbulent kinetic energy and the rate of energy transfer from the large scale to the small scale, which is different from the energy dissipation rate. The model coefficients in the modeled turbulent transport equations depend on the ratio of the turbulent kinetic energy of the large scale to that of the small scale, which renders the model more adaptive to the characteristics of individual flow. The model is tested against compressible free shear layers. The results agree satisfactorily with measurements...|$|E

Do these concepts constitute an enticing poetry of dynamical universality or do these metaphors from physics generate more specific novel and relevant concepts and experiments in the neurosciences? Using six graphics and ten measures derived from the ergodic theory of dynamical systems, we study the magnetoencephalic, MEG, records of taskless, “resting” human subjects to find consistent evidence for turbulent (chaotic) dynamics marked by intermittent turbulent eddies. This brings up an apparent discrepancy via the juxtaposition of the superposition characteristics of magnetic fields and the non-superposition properties of turbulent flow. Treating this apparent inconsistency as an existent duality, we propose a physical model for how {{that might be the}} case.

This means that particles will settle unless the velocity is increased and the flow becomes turbulent (Poloski et al. 2009 a). Also, a higher velocity is necessary to suspend the particles as the viscosity increases. This boundary can be modeled using laminar to turbulent transition model.|$|R

40|$|There {{are quite}} a few studies {{investigating}} low Reynolds number turbulence models for predicting the near-wall flow over smooth walls. However, analogous work over rough walls is sparse despite the fact that many flows of practical interest, particularly in geophysical flows and hydraulic engineering, are over rough walls. This paper presents a priori and a posteriori evaluations of low Reynolds number Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) –based modeling approaches for flows over rough walls with the help of high-resolution large-eddy simulation (LES) data. The LES data allow the calculation of the vertical distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy, the dissipation rate, the specific dissipation rate, and the <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddy</b> viscosity, so that the assumptions inherent of RANS-based turbulence models can be tested a priori.

It is shown that the flow field in a test case, a nickel droplet levitated under microgravity conditions, is in the transitional regime between laminar and turbulent flow. Past research efforts have used laminar, enhanced viscosity, and k-epsilon turbulence models to describe the flow. The method highlighted in our study is the renormalization group (RNG) algorithm. We show that an accurate description of the <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddy</b> viscosity is critical {{in order to obtain}} realistic velocity fields, and that the <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddy</b> viscosity cannot be uniform in levitated droplets. The RNG method does not impose isotropic length or time scales on the flow field, thus allowing such nonuniform features to be captured.

40|$|Magnetic dynamo action {{caused by}} the magnetorotational {{instability}} is studied in the shearing-box approximation with no imposed net magnetic flux. Consistent with recent studies, the dynamo action {{is found to be}} sensitive to the aspect ratio of the box: it is much easier to obtain in tall boxes (stretched in the direction normal to the disk plane) than in long boxes (stretched in the radial direction). Our direct numerical simulations indicate that the dynamo is possible in both cases, given a large enough magnetic Reynolds number. To explain the relatively larger effort required to obtain the dynamo action in a long box, we propose that the <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddies</b> {{caused by the}} instability most efficiently fold and mix the magnetic field lines in the radial direction. As a result, in the long box the scale of the generated strong azimuthal (stream-wise directed) magnetic field is always comparable to the scale of the <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddies.</b> In contrast, in the tall box the azimuthal magnetic flux spreads in the vertical direction over a distance exceeding the scale of the <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddies.</b> As a result, different vertical sections of the tall box are permeated by large-scale nonzero azimuthal magnetic fluxes, facilitating the instability. In agreement with this picture, the cases when the dynamo is efficient are characterized by a strong intermittency of the local azimuthal magnetic fluxes. Comment: 7 pages, 9 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R

Good agreement has been obtained between the CFD model and the PIV measurements, which demonstrates the validity of extending the current CFD model to study the effect of various design parameters (e. g. inter-anode gap, insertion of a slot) on bath flow in an industrial cell.

The integral models of the mass, momentum and concentration fluxes are obtained and transformed to a set of ordinary differential equations using some similarity transformations. The resulting system is solved to determine the centerline quantities which are used to get the mean axial velocity, mean concentration and mean density of the jet. Therefore, the centerline and mean quantities are used together with the governing equation to determine some important turbulent quantities such as, cross-stream velocity, Reynolds stress, velocity- concentration correlation, <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddy</b> viscosity and <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddy</b> diffusivity.
