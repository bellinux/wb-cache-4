5|$|Abrahams Creek {{begins in}} Franklin Township.

It then turns southwest for more than a mile, entering Forty Fort and reaching its confluence with the Susquehanna River.|$|E
5|$|Abrahams Creek is {{the main}} source of {{flooding}} in West Wyoming, Forty Fort, and Swoyersville. Sheet flooding can occur when <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> floods over Eighth Street.

The Slocum Dam, which is upstream of West Wyoming, also helps to reduce flooding on <b>the</b> <b>creek.</b> However, localized flooding and ponding frequently affect its lower reaches. <b>The</b> <b>creek</b> has been experienced extensive modifications, such as narrowing and riprap installation, in The Hollow to accommodate West Eighth Street.|$|E
5|$|At one point, Eddy Creek {{flows through}} a {{restored}} channel at a reclaimed mining site. Further downstream, <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> flows through its natural channel and cuts across {{a number of}} rock ledges. However, {{by the time it}} crosses US Route 6, it has lost its flow. Nevertheless, its channel is still discernible and its gradient is shallower. <b>The</b> <b>creek</b> loses its channel completely at the intersection of an electric transmission corridor and the Eddy Creek Mine Tunnel. It eventually reappears, but disappears again in strip pits and sinks.

5|$|Buffalo Creek {{begins in}} Hartley Township, in Union County, near the Union County/Centre County border. It flows east and {{slightly}} north between Buffalo Mountain and Branch Mountain before falling steeply through two geographical features {{known as the}} Gooseneck and Buffalo Gap. <b>The</b> <b>creek</b> then turns southeast and flows out of Hartley Township. Upon leaving Hartley Township, <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> enters Lewis Township and meanders eastward, south of Jones Mountain.

Shortly before exiting West Buffalo Township, Buffalo Creek picks up its tributary North Branch Buffalo Creek and briefly turns northwards before turning eastward again and leaving the township.|$|E
5|$|Catawissa Creek enters Columbia County in Beaver Township. It {{immediately}} {{passes by}} Bunker Hill and makes several meanders and passes by Beaver Valley. An old Conrail railroad starts paralleling Catawissa Creek at this point. In {{the southern part}} of Beaver Township, <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> is situated between Buck Mountain to the east and Catawissa Mountain to the west. <b>The</b> <b>creek</b> takes a sharp turn westwards as it passes by Shumans, where Pennsylvania Route 339 crosses <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> and Beaver Run flows into it. <b>The</b> <b>creek</b> closely follows Catawissa Mountain for a short distance before turning northwards and passing close to McCauley Mountain.

50|$|For a {{substantial}} of its length, Leach <b>Creek</b> is in <b>the</b> vicinity of Pennsylvania Route 307.

5|$|Changes of {{sediment}} patterns in <b>the</b> <b>creek</b> have also created another problem. Stemming from {{the construction of}} structures interfering with stream flow, and increased runoff from the urban areas adjoining <b>the</b> <b>creek,</b> excessive erosion has created problems not limited to just <b>the</b> <b>creek.</b> <b>The</b> <b>creek</b> is eroding material from its bed and transporting it to the ocean, but naturally, sediment from the whole watershed flowed towards the main stem via a complex network of tributaries. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warned in a 1997 study that up to $4.2million in damage occurs per year {{as a result of}} the pollution of Aliso Creek and its neighbor San Juan Creek. This includes physical damage to creek banks, bridges, pipes and other creekside structures.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{responsible}} for the degradation of fish and shrimp in <b>the</b> <b>creek.</b> The sources for chlorine in urban runoff include irrigation and car washing.
