50|$|The term triaprism is {{coined by}} George Olshevsky, {{shortened}} from <b>triple</b> <b>prism,</b> similar to duoprism {{for the product}} of two polytopes. John Horton Conway proposed a similar name proprism for product prism, a Cartesian product {{of two or more}} polytopes of dimension at least two. The triaprisms are proprisms formed from exactly three polytopes.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} effect of {{pressing}} <b>triple</b> <b>prism</b> in correcting residual compensatory head posture in postoperative congenital nystagrnus children. METHODS: From March 2007 to October 2012, 28 congenital nystagrnus children with residual compensatory head posture after surgery including 19 males and 9 females were admitted to our department. The average age of these children was 8. 7 years old, ranging from 4 to 20. All of them were treated by pressing <b>triple</b> <b>prism.</b> Improvement of vision and compensatory head posture were {{used to evaluate the}} efficacy during the follow up. RESULTS: Twenty-seven children adhere to follow-up. One child failed to follow-up. 1) Symptoms: most children did not complain visual distortion, dizziness when wearing glasses. Comfort rate was reaching 96 %(26 / 27). 2) Visual improvement: vision rose from(0. 5 ± 0. 3) to(0. 6 ± 0. 2) after wearing glasses, however, the difference was not statistically significant(P > 0. 05). 3) Improvement of compensatory head posture: compensatory head posture was decreased after wearing glasses, from(9. 6 ± 2. 2) ° to(5. 7 ± 2. 2) ° with significantly difference(P CONCLUSION: Pressing <b>triple</b> <b>prism</b> is an effective way to cure residual compensatory head posture after congenital nystagmus surgery...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the differences between}} synoptophore and <b>triple</b> <b>prism</b> strabismometry and its possible cause. METHODS: There were 347 patients with horizontal concomitant strabismus involved, in which 76 patients were esotropia, 37 patients were male while 39 were female, with average age of 13. 27 ± 7. 77 years old. There were 271 patients with exotropia, 131 cases were male while 140 were female, with average age of 15. 43 ± 8. 42 years old. All the patients were examined by synoptophore and prism plus shaded strabismometry in a long distance of 6 m. Datas were analyzed by SPSS 17. 0. RESULTS: In the exotropia patients, the conversions of circular degree(°) and prism degree(△) were: 1 °= 0. 29 △ ～ 1. 78 △, which was statistically significant with intermittent strabismus(P = 0. 001). While in the esotropia patients, the conversions were: 1 °= 2. 01 △ ～ 2. 15 △. CONCLUSION: The diversity between the two methods is enlarged {{with the increase of}} squint angle for exotropia patients. While in esotropia patients, the diversity decreased with the increase of squint angle. Synoptophore equipped with + 7. 00 D, defects of the <b>triple</b> <b>prism</b> itself and proximal convergence during exam may be the reasons for the diversity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBy {{means of}} {{applying}} self-designed experimental system for flame acceleration, the paper investigated solid structure, blockage ratios, spatial layout and ignition distance of obstacles influence on flame speed and overpressure. In the experiments, five kinds of obstacles (plates, cuboids, <b>triple</b> <b>prisms,</b> quadruple prisms and cylinders) were adopted with {{three kinds of}} blockage ratios (20 %, 40 % and 60 %). For the same blockage ratios, results demonstrated that plates and <b>triple</b> <b>prisms</b> increased flame speed and overpressure much larger. cuboids were intermediate while effect of quadruple prisms and cylinders were comparatively limited. When obstacles were put in the place to form bifurcation channel, which would lead to flame speed and overpressure rose rapidly. Flame speed and overpressure at first increased and then minished with the augument of ignition distance. When obstacles were put at L/S≈ 6. 5 (length/side), fla me speed and overpressure were much influenced. flame speed was affected larger than overpressure in all above condition. The results were expected to have some help on preventing and controlling gas explosive and to provide reference for industry safety design...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the propagation characteristics of methane-air deflagration flames {{and in an}} obstacle-filled tube, a high-speed color video camera, photoelectric sensors, and pressure transducers were {{used to test the}} deflagration flame propagating parameters. The tests were run in a 1500 mm long plexiglass tube with a 100 × 100 mm square cross-section. The obstacles included four types of repeated baffles and five forms of solid structure obstacles. The results showed that: (1) the flame front was constantly distorted, stretched, and deformed by different types of obstacles and, consequently, the flame propagating parameters increased; (2) plates and <b>triple</b> <b>prisms</b> increased the speed of the flame and overpressure to the highest extent, whereas cuboids and quadrangulars exerted an intermediate effect. However, the effect of cylindrical obstacles was comparatively limited. It was suggested that the obstacle’s surface edge mutation or curvature changes were the main factors stimulating the flame acceleration; (3) the peak pressure of deflagration was relatively low near the ignition end, increased gradually until it reached the maximum at the middle of the tube, and decreased rapidly near the open end; and (4) the fixed obstacles in front of the flame exhibited a blocking effect on flame propagation during the initial stages; the flame speed and overpressure increased when the flame came into contact with the obstacles. This study is of significance because it explains the methane-air propagation mechanism induced by different types of obstacles. The findings have value for preventing or controlling gas explosion disasters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the range}} of {{frequency}} doubling wavelengths is analyzed through KTiOPO 4 (KTP) dispersion research. The best phase-matching angle of KTP crystal for frequency doubling at 1319 nm is calculated {{as well as the}} effective nonlinear coefficient. Thus the KTP cutting method is determined. In the experiments,we use the crystal which is 7 × 7 × 7 mm for frequency doubling at 1319 nm to achieve 660 nm red laser. Then we get the optical spectrum with a <b>triple</b> <b>prism</b> and measure the two wave energy with two pyroelectric detectors. The frequency doubling efficiency can reach 34. 3 %. This demonstrates that the experimental system is with good stability...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the clinical effect of surgical treatment on monocular serious cataract with exotropia. METHODS: Reviewed 45 patients diagnosed as cataract with exotropia who accepted cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation from Mar. 2010 to Dec. 2012 in our hospital. Preoperatively the visual acuity of 44 patients was RESULTS: One 2 -year old child couldn't {{cooperate with the}} examination. The other congenital cataract patient didn't acquire BSV and diplopia. Among 5 middle-aged patients, the BCVA of 3 cases were above 0. 6 with normal fundus and BSV, 2 cases were finger count with abnormal fundus and without BSV.

The main objective {{of the project was}} to obtain an accurate equilibrium beach profile at a location on Mustang Island, and to compare the actual profile to a predicted profile. The predicted profile is based on the median grain size diameter of sediment samples taken from the dune crest to approximately 4000 ft offshore. The survey was accomplished using an electronic total station with a standard surveying rod on land, and the underwater profile was measured with a sled towed behind a boat. A <b>triple</b> <b>prism</b> was attached to both the top of the rod and sled. The sled is an aluminum and steel structure equipped with two 12 ft long skids and a 36. 5 ft mast. The predicted profiles are based on two methods. One method uses Dean's equation for equilibrium beach profiles, z = Ax 2 / 3, where z is the water depth, A is the profile scale factor related to the sediment fall velocity, and x is the distance offshore. The other method involves a more complex analysis described by Dean and Dalrymple, which accounts for a variation in sediment size and profile scale factor, A, in the offshore direction. Both methods are described and compared in this report. This data will also be used by Dr. R. G. Dean of the University of Florida in a study he is conducting on equilibrium beach profile prediction[URL]...|$|E
