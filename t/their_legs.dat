5|$|In P. labiata and in {{some other}} species, {{contests}} between males usually last only 5 to 10seconds, and only <b>their</b> <b>legs</b> make contact.|$|E
5|$|At {{the high}} school, Shane and Otis split up after {{struggling}} against {{a horde of}} walkers. Both injure <b>their</b> <b>legs</b> while escaping, slowing their progress down. Shane and Otis seemingly are out of options for survival. They begin to limp back to their truck, eventually running low on ammo.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the worker}} and soldier castes lack wings and thus never fly, and the reproductives use their wings {{for just a}} brief amount of time, {{termites}} predominantly rely upon <b>their</b> <b>legs</b> to move about.|$|E
5000|$|Muscle Wire Driven: Utilise Nitinol (nickel - {{titanium}} alloy) wires for <b>their</b> <b>leg</b> actuators.|$|R
50|$|At the Scotiabank ATM, {{teams had}} to get <b>their</b> <b>leg's</b> money from the Automated teller machine.|$|R
50|$|For skiers in {{this class}} with above the knee amputations, how to fall {{properly}} is an important skill. They are taught {{to try to prevent}} the stump of <b>their</b> <b>leg</b> from hitting the snow as it can cause more damage to that leg than the one that is not partially missing. When working on side stepping, the skier is supported to keep the stump of <b>their</b> <b>leg</b> on the uphill side. Elite skiers are taught to avoid using outriggers as crutches. They are taught to turn using <b>their</b> <b>leg</b> instead of <b>their</b> ski poles. In getting on ski lifts, skiers {{in this class}}ification with amputations are taught to lift their outriggers off the ground and point them forward.|$|R
5|$|Divers are aquatic birds {{the size}} of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. They swim well and fly {{adequately}} but, because <b>their</b> <b>legs</b> are placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on land. They feed on fish and other aquatic animals.|$|E
5|$|Loons are aquatic birds {{the size}} of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. Their plumage is largely gray or black and they have spear-shaped bills. Loons swim well and fly {{adequately}} but, because <b>their</b> <b>legs</b> are placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on land.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse have small, pigeon like {{heads and}} necks, but sturdy compact bodies. They have long pointed wings and {{sometimes}} tails and a fast direct flight. Flocks fly to watering holes {{at dawn and}} dusk. <b>Their</b> <b>legs</b> are feathered down to the toes.|$|E
50|$|At the Scotiabank ATM, {{teams had}} to get <b>their</b> <b>leg's</b> money from the Automated teller machine, which were US$260.|$|R

5|$|These {{earliest}} tetrapods {{were not}} terrestrial. The earliest confirmed terrestrial forms are {{known from the}} early Carboniferous deposits, some 20 million years later. Still, they may have spent very brief periods out of water and would have used <b>their</b> <b>legs</b> to paw {{their way through the}} mud.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on <b>their</b> <b>legs</b> to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E
5|$|During Cook's second voyage, Forster brought two Tahitian Dogs {{aboard the}} ship to take home to England. They were tested with arrow poison at Malakula by having <b>their</b> <b>legs</b> opened with a lancet and {{inserted}} with the substance; both dogs recovered, though one later died from eating poisonous fish. However, {{the fate of the}} other dog and their remains is unknown.|$|E
50|$|Diversity {{were among}} the many torch bearers in London's 2012 Olympic Torch Relay, {{completing}} <b>their</b> <b>leg</b> of the journey on 22 July 2012.|$|R
5000|$|One Month Club: Males {{grow their}} beards out and females grow out <b>their</b> <b>leg</b> hair. The {{male and female}} with the longest hair wins.|$|R
50|$|Examples: Three-month-old infants {{lying under}} a mobile had a string {{attached}} to <b>their</b> right <b>leg</b> {{and then to}} the mobile so that when they moved <b>their</b> <b>leg</b> the mobile would move. When the string was switched to the left legs, the infants would easily shift to moving that leg to activate the mobile.|$|R
5|$|Females of P. labiata and P. schultzi try to {{kill and}} eat their mates during or after copulation, by {{twisting}} and lunging. The males wait until the females have hunched <b>their</b> <b>legs,</b> making this attack less likely. Males also try to abseil from a silk thread to approach from above, but females may manoeuvre to get the higher position. If the female moves at all, the male leaps and runs away.|$|E
5|$|Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through {{evaporation}} {{has been proposed}} {{as a reason for}} this behavior, but it does not make any sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. Because of this habit, <b>their</b> <b>legs</b> are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Loons are aquatic {{birds that}} are {{the size of a}} large duck, to which they are unrelated. Their plumage is largely gray or black, and they have spear-shaped bills. Loons swim well and fly adequately, but, because <b>their</b> <b>legs</b> are placed towards the rear of the body, are {{extremely}} poor at walking. Three species have been recorded in Maryland.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 94 renowned skiers or their {{descendants}} {{participated in the}} relay, the names of whom remained secret until they began <b>their</b> <b>leg</b> of the journey.|$|R
50|$|The wrestler {{drops to}} one knee and extends <b>their</b> other <b>leg,</b> then quickly pivots their body around, using <b>their</b> {{extended}} <b>leg</b> to knock away the opponent’s legs.|$|R
5000|$|Turn down: The rider will {{whip the}} bike out {{to one side}} and turn the handle bars into his or her legs {{wrapping}} them around <b>their</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|R
5|$|Loons are aquatic birds, {{the size}} of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. Their plumage is largely gray or black, and they have spear-shaped bills. Loons swim well and fly adequately, but are almost hopeless on land, because <b>their</b> <b>legs</b> are placed towards the rear of the body. Four species have been {{recorded}} in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Loons, {{known as}} divers in Europe, are aquatic birds {{the size of}} a large duck, to which they are unrelated. Their plumage is largely grey or black, and they have spear-shaped bills. Loons swim well and fly adequately, but, because <b>their</b> <b>legs</b> are placed towards the rear of the body, are almost {{helpless}} on land.|$|E
5|$|The diplosegments of millipedes {{have evolved}} in {{conjunction}} with their burrowing habits, and nearly all millipedes adopt a mainly subterranean lifestyle. They use three main methods of burrowing; bulldozing, wedging and boring. Members of the orders Julida, Spirobolida and Spirostreptida, lower their heads and barge {{their way into the}} substrate, the collum being the portion of their exoskeleton that leads the way. Flat-backed millipedes in the order Polydesmida tend to insert their front end, like a wedge, into a horizontal crevice, and then widen the crack by pushing upwards with <b>their</b> <b>legs,</b> the paranota in this instance constituting the main lifting surface. Boring is used by members of the order Polyzoniida. These have smaller segments at the front and increasingly large ones further back; they propel themselves forward into a crack with <b>their</b> <b>legs,</b> the wedge-shaped body widening the gap as they go. Some millipedes have adopted an above-ground lifestyle and lost the burrowing habit. This may be because they are too small to have enough leverage to burrow, or because they are too large to make the effort worthwhile, or in some cases because they move relatively fast (for a millipede) and are active predators.|$|E
50|$|Extend <b>their</b> front <b>legs</b> {{and tuck}} <b>their</b> rear <b>legs</b> {{so that they}} can rotate their rear half further while their front half rotates in the {{opposite}} direction less.|$|R
50|$|After {{a year of}} touring, <b>their</b> final <b>leg</b> {{was held}} in Dagupan on May 7, 2016. After <b>their</b> final <b>leg,</b> they decided to lean on acting as individuals.|$|R
50|$|KL2-class {{competitors}} have partial leg and trunk function alongside good arm strength. They {{may require a}} backrest and footboard to propel the canoe depending on <b>their</b> <b>leg</b> function.|$|R
5|$|The giraffe {{has also}} been used for some {{scientific}} experiments and discoveries. Scientists {{have looked at the}} properties of giraffe skin when developing suits for astronauts and fighter pilots because the people in these professions are in danger of passing out if blood rushes to <b>their</b> <b>legs.</b> Computer scientists have modeled the coat patterns of several subspecies using reaction–diffusion mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{lightness}} and rigidity of {{the blade}} compared to muscle and bone may allow blade runners to swing <b>their</b> <b>legs</b> faster than non-disabled runners. In comments on the article, Peter Weyand and biomechanist Matthew Bundle noted that {{the study found that}} Pistorius re-positioned his legs 15.7 percent faster than most world record sprinters, allowing for a 15 to 30 percent increase in sprint speed.|$|E
5|$|The spiders {{are unique}} in the {{flexible}} and teethed hook-like claws on the last segments (tarsus) of <b>their</b> <b>legs.</b> These elongated claws resemble those of spiders in the family Gradungulidae of Australia and New Zealand, but the two families are only distantly related. Hooked tarsal claws are also present {{to a lesser extent}} in the unrelated genera Doryonychus of Tetragnathidae, Hetrogriffus of Thomisidae and Celaenia of Araneidae.|$|E
25|$|When falling, skiers in {{this class}} with above the knee amputations are taught {{to try to prevent}} the stump of <b>their</b> <b>leg</b> from hitting the snow as it can cause more damage to that leg than the one that is not {{partially}} missing. When working on side stepping, the skier is supported to keep the stump of <b>their</b> <b>leg</b> on the uphill side. Elite skiers are taught to avoid using outriggers as crutches. Skiers are taught to turn using <b>their</b> <b>leg</b> instead of <b>their</b> ski poles. Skiers {{in this class}} can use the outrigger to assist in maintaining their balance as they turn on the hill. A skier with an above the knee amputation may have a better ability to complete turns on the opposite of their amputation. In getting on ski lifts, skiers with above the knee amputations in this classification should lift their outriggers off the ground and point them forward.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used kick in kickboxing due to its power and ease of use. In most styles, the instep is used to strike, though most Karate styles would allow the shin as official technique for a street fight. To execute, the attacker swings <b>their</b> <b>leg</b> sideways in a circular motion, kicking the opponent's side with the front of the leg, usually with the instep, ball of the foot, toe, or shin. Also performable is a 360-degree kick in which the attacker performs a full circle with <b>their</b> <b>leg,</b> in which the striking surface is generally either the instep, shin or ball of the foot.|$|R
50|$|Kick ball: Placing a small ball {{in front}} of the infant and {{encouraging}} them to kick it by picking them up by the arms and moving <b>their</b> <b>leg</b> towards the ball. This swinging action builds stomach and leg muscles.|$|R
