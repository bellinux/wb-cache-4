5|$|During the Burma Campaign in 1944–1945, the 3rd Commando Brigade {{participated in}} several coastal {{landings}} of the Southern Front offensive. These landings {{culminated in the}} battle of Hill 170 at Kangaw. Here Lieutenant George Knowland of No. 1 Commando was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. The Commandos' victory in the 36-hour battle for Hill 170 cut off the escape of the 54th Japanese Division. Further amphibious landings by the 25th Indian Infantry Division and the overland advance of the 82nd (West Africa) Division made the Japanese position in the Arakan untenable. A general withdrawal was ordered to avoid the complete destruction of the Twenty-Eighth Japanese Army. The Commando brigade was then withdrawn to India in preparation for Operation Zipper, the planned invasion of Malaya. <b>The</b> <b>Zipper</b> landings were not needed due to the Japanese surrender so the brigade was sent to Hong Kong for policing duties instead.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{wanted the}} Doctor to realise that Rose has {{something}} to offer to his cause. Their holding hands while running was meant to signify {{that they were a}} team, despite him not asking her yet, and they were not to question their relationship. The episode was intended to be presented from Rose's point-of-view. For audience identification purposes, Davies wanted the alien menace to be easily mistaken as human, so that it was possible for Rose to mistake the aliens for humans. Davies felt that {{there was no need to}} create a new monster, as the Autons met these criteria. The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were uncomfortable for the actors; which meant that frequent breaks from filming were needed. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used in post-production to cover up <b>the</b> <b>zipper</b> on the back of the necks of the Auton costumes. Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of shop windows from their first appearance in Spearhead from Space, although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in Spearhead.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>zipper</b> is {{a popular}} device for {{temporarily}} joining two edges of fabric. Zippers are found on trousers, jeans, jackets, and luggage. Whitcomb L. Judson was an American mechanical engineer from Chicago {{who was the first}} to invent, conceive of the idea, and to construct a workable zipper. Using a hook-and-eye device, Judson intended for this earliest form of <b>the</b> <b>zipper</b> to be used on shoes. He also conceived the idea of the slide fastener mechanism in conjunction with the invention of <b>the</b> <b>zipper.</b> Patents were issued to Judson for <b>the</b> <b>zipper</b> in 1891, 1894, and 1905.|$|E

25|$|Metal toothed {{watertight}} zippers rely {{on pressure}} {{between the two}} rubberized contact surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>zipper</b> tapes alongside the teeth for sealing. To get this pressure, the slider needs to press the two faces together while closing, and this increases friction between the slider and the teeth, so <b>the</b> <b>zipper</b> requires more force to close than regular zippers. If the two rows of open teeth are lined up and close together {{in front of the}} pull it will prevent misalignment which can permanently damage the sealing edge, and allow <b>the</b> <b>zipper</b> to be closed with less effort. Friction can be reduced by suitable lubrication which is usually done with a waterproof wax or grease which remains on <b>the</b> <b>zipper</b> when wet. There should not be an excessive buildup of lubricant which would stick to particles of grit and cause wear and additional friction. The plastic tooth zippers have less friction than the metal teeth and need less force to close.|$|E

25|$|Dressing into a {{dry suit}} is usually more {{time-consuming}} than a wet suit, and may require {{the assistance of}} another person to check the neck seal and close <b>the</b> <b>zipper.</b> In situations where the air is warm but the water cold, a prolonged time {{on the deck of}} a boat donning a dry suit and other gear can present a risk of overheating to the diver. This is a particular problem to relatively inexperienced divers, who may require more time to dress in. This problem can be mitigated by preparing all other equipment as far as possible before fully donning the suit and to wet the outside of the suit, and the hair and face after closing <b>the</b> <b>zipper,</b> to provide some evaporative cooling while on deck. Professional stand-by divers may have a similar problem, as they are required to be ready for deployment at all times while the working diver is in the water, which may involve waiting on deck for several hours. Wetting the outside of the suit, and seating the diver in shade and a breeze are the usual solution to this problem.|$|E
25|$|Snap front/legs : Some sleepers, {{especially}} in infant sizes, replace the usual front zipper with a front opening closing with snap fasteners. In infant sizes, this opening usually forks at the crotch, and extends down {{the insides of}} both legs to the ankles, {{in order to give}} access for diaper changes. This design tends to be less effective at eliminating drafts than <b>the</b> <b>zipper</b> closure, and is most often seen on lighter-weight sleepers designed for warmer weather.|$|E
25|$|DNA can be copied {{very easily}} and {{accurately}} because {{each piece of}} DNA can direct {{the creation of a}} new copy of its information. This is because DNA is made of two strands that pair together like the two sides of a zipper. The nucleotides are in the center, like the teeth in <b>the</b> <b>zipper,</b> and pair up to hold the two strands together. Importantly, the four different sorts of nucleotides are different shapes, so for the strands to close up properly, an A nucleotide must go opposite a T nucleotide, and a G opposite a C. This exact pairing is called base pairing.|$|E
40|$|Synapses {{vary widely}} in the {{probability}} of neurotransmitter release. We tested the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>zippered</b> state of <b>the</b> trans-SNARE (Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor) complex determines initial release probability. We tested this hypothesis at phasic and tonic synapses which differ by 100 - 1000 -fold in neurotransmitter release probability. We injected, presynaptically, three Clostridial neurotoxins which bind and cleave at different sites on VAMP to determine whether these sites were occluded by <b>the</b> <b>zippering</b> of <b>the</b> SNARE complex or open to proteolytic attack. Under low stimulation conditions, the catalytic light-chain fragment of botulinum B (BoNT/B-LC) inhibited evoked release at both phasic and tonic synapses and cleaved VAMP; however, neither BoNT/D-LC nor tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT-LC) were effective in these conditions. The susceptibility of VAMP to only BoNT/B-LC indicated that SNARE complexes at both phasic and tonic synapses were partially <b>zippered</b> only at <b>the</b> N-terminal end to approximately the zero-layer with the C-terminal end exposed under resting state. Therefore, the existence of <b>the</b> same partially <b>zippered</b> state of <b>the</b> trans-SNARE complex at both phasic and tonic synapses indicates that release probability is not determined solely by <b>the</b> <b>zippered</b> state of <b>the</b> trans-SNARE complex {{at least to the}} zero-layer...|$|R

25|$|At 20:22 UTC, Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 60 {{arrived in}} Toronto twelve minutes late. Some of the {{passengers}} and baggage, including the bag Singh had checked in, were transferred to Air India Flight 182. In response to threats from Sikh activists, Air India had requested extra security, leading Canada to assign extra policemen in terminals in Toronto and Montreal, and all baggage was to be checked by X-ray or by hand. But after the x-ray machine broke down that day, inspectors used a portable PDD-4 explosive sniffer. An Air India security officer had demonstrated that it made a loud scream when a lit match was held an inch away, and showed {{that it should be}} used {{around the edge of the}} bag being tested. Between 5:15 and 6:00, the sniffer was heard to beep at a soft-sided maroon suitcase with a zipper going all around; it beeped in a low volume near <b>the</b> <b>zipper</b> lock. But Air India was not informed since checkers were not instructed on how to react to only a short beep, so they allowed the bag to pass on its way. Later investigation would determine that the two containers that could have contained M. Singh's bag were placed close to the sensitive electronic bay of the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|On November 6, 1928, an {{electronic}} news ticker {{known as the}} Motograph News Bulletin (colloquially known as the [...] "zipper") was introduced near {{the base of the}} building. <b>The</b> <b>zipper</b> originally consisted of 14,800 light bulbs, with the display controlled by a chain conveyor system inside the building; individual letter elements (a form of movable type) were loaded into frames to spell out news headlines. As the frames moved along the conveyor, the letters themselves triggered electrical contacts which lit the external bulbs (<b>the</b> <b>zipper</b> has since been upgraded to use modern LED technology). The first headline displayed on <b>the</b> <b>zipper</b> announced Herbert Hoover's victory in that day's presidential election. <b>The</b> <b>zipper</b> was used to display other major news headlines of the era, and its content later expanded to include sports and weather updates as well.

40|$|<b>The</b> leucine <b>zipper</b> motif {{has been}} {{observed}} {{in a number of}} proteins thought to function as eucaryotic transcription factors. Mutation of <b>the</b> leucine <b>zipper</b> interferes with protein dimerization and DNA binding. We examined the effect of point mutations in <b>the</b> leucine <b>zipper</b> of c-Myc on its ability to dimerize in vitro and to inhibit Friend murine erythroleukemia (F-MEL) differentiation. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking studies failed to provide evidence for homodimerization of in vitro-synthesized c-Myc protein, although it was readily demonstrated for c-Jun. Nevertheless, whereas transfected wild-type c-myc sequences strongly inhibited F-MEL differentiation, those with single or multiple mutations in <b>the</b> leucine <b>zipper</b> were only partially effective in this regard. Since <b>the</b> leucine <b>zipper</b> domain of c-Myc is essential for its cooperative effect in ras oncogene-mediated transformation, this study emphasizes the close relationship that exists between transformation and hematopoietic commitment and differentiation. c-Myc may produce its effects on F-MEL differentiation through leucine zipper-mediated heterodimeric associations rather than homodimeric ones...|$|R
