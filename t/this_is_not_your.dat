He reminded the six men and three women that they were not politicians and it was not their job to protect the image of the country. You have been told that this will have an international ramification and will affect the image of Mauritius… <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>your</b> role, Fekna said. You must not allow yourself to be influenced by this, you are not politicians, you have to base yourself on what has happened.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by commentators; some reviewers praised it for its composition, while other critics {{felt that the}} lyrics were not profound. Billboard Chuck Taylor called the song [...] "instantly memorable" [...] and praised its instrumentation for being different [...] "from the scores of adolescent thrust-rockers currently dominating the scene." [...] Dubbing it [...] "elegant, timeless pop/rock", Taylor qualified it as [...] "one of the great discoveries of the year", while Pete Waterman, writing for The Guardian in 2007, stated it was [...] "one of [...] favourite songs of recent years". Eric R. Danton from the Hartford Courant [...] classified it as the best track on the album, while Erlewine called it [...] "the template {{for the rest of}} his debut". In contrast, Wilson Kung said the song [...] "pales in comparison to some of the truly strong songs" [...] on the album Daniel Powter. Alan Connor of BBC News Magazine said it is a typical sentimental song but that in [...] "Bad Day"'s case [...] "there's even less detail". He said the song [...] "is so low on the specifics, there are some couplets that feel like they've been translated from a foreign language, possibly by a computer". A writer for The Daily Edge called it [...] "a song so sweet it gave you a toothache", while a reviewer from The Scotsman called it a [...] "horrible song". Bill Lamb said it [...] "feels genuine" [...] but [...] "if you are looking for depth, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>your</b> song", Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times said the song is [...] "baleful but soulful", and People commented: [...] "'Bad Day' may be catchy enough to overcome its trite lyrics".|$|E

Jenkins stated, [...] "One {{of the biggest challenges}} was trying to create a score that was heavily steeped in 1980's while still trying to bring something new to the table... <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>your</b> typical film score, as it's mostly electronic based...

2500|$|An {{ongoing debate}} {{related to the}} [...] "new" [...] {{perspective}} has been over Paul's use of the Greek word pistis (πίστις, meaning [...] "trust", [...] "belief", [...] "faith", or [...] "faithfulness"). Writers with a more historic Lutheran and Reformed perspective have typically interpreted this word as meaning a belief in God and Christ, and trust in Christ for salvation with faith that he will save you. This interpretation is based on several passages from the Christian Bible, notably Ephesians 2:8–9, which reads, [...] "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>your</b> own doing; it is the gift of God, not {{as a result of}} works, so that no one may boast." [...] Interestingly, E. P. Sanders, notes that Ephesians 2:9 teaches the traditional perspectives.|$|E
2500|$|Songs for the Deaf {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} {{and is often}} cited {{as one of the}} band's greatest albums to date. On Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 from aggregated critic reviews, Songs for the Deaf is assigned a score of 89, indicating [...] "universal acclaim", making the album the third highest-rated on the site from 2002. Josh Tyrangiel of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "the year's best hard-rock album", giving it an A. Splendid said [...] "the bottom line is that QOTSA turns in another genre-demolishing, hard-as-titanium album in Songs for the Deaf. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>your</b> father's metal. It's better." [...] Mojo listed the album as the year's third best. Kludge ranked it at number six on their list of best albums of 2002. NME placed the album as the sixth best, with the three singles each making the magazine's [...] "Tracks of the Year" [...] list over the course of 2002/2003.

2500|$|A {{chapter of}} the work titled [...] "Revenge", focuses on obtaining {{retribution}} from perceived enemies. The chapter begins with a recounting of long-running argument between Trump and actress Rosie O'Donnell. Trump additionally writes of businessman Mark Cuban that he [...] "has absolutely zero television persona or personality" [...] and said of his appearance that he has [...] "the look of a Neanderthal" [...] and [...] "just doesn't get it". He praises Bill Clinton and criticizes Mario Cuomo, writing, [...] "Bill Clinton is a great guy with courage, Mario Cuomo is a disloyal guy without courage." [...] Trump comments, [...] "My motto is: Always get even. When somebody screws you, screw them back in spades." [...] Trump wrote that he, [...] "love to crush {{the other side and}} take the benefits." [...] He elaborated on the value of revenge, [...] "When someone intentionally harms you or your reputation, how do you react? I strike back, doing the same thing to them only ten times worse." [...] Trump cautions readers of the dangers of the planet, [...] "The world is a vicious and brutal place. We think we're civilized. In truth, it's a cruel world and people are ruthless." [...] Trump writes that those who do not seek revenge are remiss, [...] "I tell people, 'Get even!' <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>your</b> typical advice, get even, but this is real-life advice. If you don't get even, you are just a schmuck!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The film {{became a}} {{critical}} success garnering the best reception for a Disney animated film since Dumbo. In a personal letter to Walt Disney, director Michael Curtiz hailed {{the film as}} the [...] "masterpiece of all pictures you have done." [...] Producer Hal Wallis declared, [...] "If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>your</b> best, it {{is very close to}} the top." [...] Mae Tinee, reviewing for The Chicago Tribune, remarked [...] "The film not only is handsome, with imaginative art and glowing colors to bedeck the old fairy tale, but it also is told in a gentle fashion, without the lurid villains which sometimes give little lots nightmares. It is enhanced by the sudden, piquant touches of humor and the music which appeal to old and young." [...] However, the characterization of Cinderella received a mixed reception. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote, [...] "The beautiful Cinderella has a voluptuous face and form—not to mention an eager disposition—to compare with Al Capp's Daisy Mae." [...] However, criticizing her role and personality, Crowther opined, [...] "As a consequence, the situation in which they are mutually involved have the constraint and immobility of panel-expressed episodes. When Mr. Disney tries to make them behave like human beings, they're banal." [...] Similarly, Variety claimed the film found [...] "more success in projecting the lower animals than in its central character, Cinderella, who is on the colorless, doll-faced side, as is the Prince Charming." ...|$|E
