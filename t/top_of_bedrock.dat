40|$|Important {{controlling}} {{factors of}} mass movements are generally soil water and geometric-topographic terrain {{factors such as}} inclination, curvature type and degree, and the relative position of unstable slopes and embankments. In addition, various geologic parameters that have a direct or indirect connection to soil-mechanical properties of slide masses are also of importance. Some studies also emphasise tectonic parameters {{in the context of}} susceptibility to mass movements. This study considers the relevance of tectonic and structural parameters in bedrock formations for landslides in periglacial hillslope sediments on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bedrock.</b> The research area is part of the southern Solling anticline, a saddle structure in the Middle Bunter Sandstone formation in northern Hesse and southern Lower Saxony (Germany). In this geologic formation, sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone are interbedded with impermeable strata. Uplift of the Solling anticline, in particular during the Quaternary, resulted in a partially intensive dissection of the Bunter Sandstone plateau into separate blocks with disrupted, tilted, and partially rotated layers. The structural conditions have an indirect impact upon landslides in the superposed hillslope sediments. Water flow along strata and joints above water impermeable strata cause water infiltration and moistening of the periglacial hillslope sediments on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bedrock.</b> Mass movements are frequently linked to sites of outcrop springs and occur after long periods of rainfall. A GIS-based analysis was used to statistically evaluate possible factors controlling landslides. Factors were weighted and included in an empiric-statistical model that allows spatial description of hazard potentials due to mass movements. In addition to morphologic parameters, the structural parameters <b>of</b> the <b>bedrock</b> are <b>of</b> utmost importance for the occurrence of landslides...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the tunnel}} being {{designed}} and {{constructed in the}} 1950s, very little consideration was given to seismic factors. The river bed is a 600 m thick layer of sediment on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>bedrock.</b> This sedimentary layer may liquefy during a major earthquake, leaving the tunnel with nothing to rest on, and thus vulnerable to total collapse. In recent years, as the awareness {{of the effect of}} serious seismic activity developed, an engineering assessment and subsequent retrofit project was initiated to increase the survivability of the tunnel {{in the event of a}} significant earthquake. This retrofit project started in the fall of 2004 and had been completed by the spring of 2006.|$|E

5000|$|The bedrock surface {{cracked up}} further still, also outside the main fault lines, {{exacerbated}} by {{erosion by water}} and ice. Looser accretions that had settled on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bedrock</b> during the Cambrium, Ordovician and Silurian Periods eroded off during the following 200 million years, causing much <b>of</b> the <b>bedrock</b> to resurface. The final [...] "molding" [...] of the landscape of Ljan {{took place during the}} Quaternary Period—the recent 1½ million years—when the land was frozen under glaciers at least five times. Each time, when the ice melted, water seared into the thin fissures—weakness zones—that had originated in the three previous geological periods. At Ljan and neighboring Hauketo flat rock layers go horizontally, and this gave rise to the steep slope of the Ljanselva valley, Liadalen, as ice and water sheared straight down into the packed rock layers.|$|R
40|$|Geophysical {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} on the temperate glaciers of Sarenne (Alps) and Chacaltaya (Bolivia) using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) at medium frequency range (50 MHz), in order to evaluate the ice thickness. The results clearly show the reflection at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bedrock</b> at depths over 40 meters for Sarenne. For Chacaltaya, the ice thickness reaches 16 meters only. However, if intermediate reflectors are present, they can attenuate or even overshadow the deep reflection on the bedrock. These reflectors are attributed to some blocks of rock, crevasses or liquid water.

5000|$|Open hole completion: the MLS is {{inserted}} down a completely open borehole with no casing, except perhaps a surficial casing through overburden into the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>bedrock.</b> This installation method only works in intact rock or in borings drilled in overburden that stay open when the drill bit and rods are removed. This installation method {{runs the risk}} of cave in or blockage occurring during installation that may jeopardize the positioning of the sand packs and seals. The risk of borehole collapse is reduced when the borehole is filled with drilling fluid. However, installations of MLS systems in boreholes filled with drilling fluids require more vigorous well development, and, in some cases, jeopardizes the hydrochemistry. Complete removal of bentonite drilling fluids may not be possible due to the limited ability to vigorously develop engineered MLS systems.|$|E

40|$|A thin, {{dark brown}} rock varnish is {{described}} from ice-smoothed bedrock on the forefield of a glacier in North Norway. It occurs only in narrow strips (ca 100 mm or less wide) which run roughly {{parallel to the}} ice front and along the <b>top</b> edges <b>of</b> small treads of a series <b>of</b> <b>bedrock</b> steps. The varnish is hard, thin (&# 60; 10 μm) and consists of an iron/manganese deposit, greatly enriched in these elements compared with {{the composition of the}} underlying gabbroic bedrock. It is suggested that the varnish formation is due to localized changes in Eh/pH conditions in subglacial regelation ice and meltwater at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bedrock</b> steps. These changes may be due to CO 2 and/or O 2 degassing from water held at higher pressures under the ice than in cavities downstream where the ice is decoupled from the bedrock. Glacier retreat rates indicate that the varnish has remained exposed subaerially at the surface for about twenty years, and its restricted occurrence suggests that it is not of biological origin but rather is essentially authigenic. Possible subglacial origins for associated iron and silica precipitates are also suggested...|$|R
50|$|Edges of sloughs are {{layers of}} {{sediment}} deposited by a river over time. The {{development of this}} landscape is thought to occur by the preferential formation <b>of</b> peat in <b>bedrock</b> depressions.

Different rates of this peat accumulation could be triggered by variations in microtopography that alter plant production and vegetation type.

40|$|The Quaternary basins of the axial zone {{of central}} Apennines {{represent}} a key areas {{for a better}} understanding of the morphotectonic evolution of this sector of the chain, during the Pleistocene times.

These basins was raised by Pleistocene tectonic uplift and subsequently some of them were partially incised by fluvial network. In order to improve the knowledge on the evolution, and the extinction of these basins, morphotectonic features, such as relicts of ancient and more recent planation surfaces and drainage network arrangements, have been correlated to the distribution of the master faults which controlled the development of the intramontane basins of Umbria-Marche sector.

The {{aim was to}} assess the ability to identify variations in the depth of the bottom sediments, as well as variations in rock quality and the possible presence of weak zones in the rock. Reference data from a seismic survey and geotechnical drilling was used for evaluation the result. An underwater layout of 121 underwater and 37 land based electrodes at a separation of 5 m was used. Repeated measurements were made to assess the temporal variation in urban noise, which lead to doing the actual survey during the quiet night hours. The resistivity data are of good quality and the inversion results in low residuals. The invested section shows a low resistivity layer corresponding to sediments on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>bedrock</b> with varying resistivity, where the interpreted depth to bedrock is in good accordance with the reference data.
