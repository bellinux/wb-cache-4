5|$|Computer Gamer {{gave the}} Amstrad version 85%, praising the {{gameplay}} and graphics. <b>They</b> <b>noted</b> {{that it was}} an approachable flight simulator that can be played without reading the manual. Amstrad Action rated this version at 54% calling it challenging, but lacking in action. They described environmental detail and fighting as the high points, but criticized sound as poor and graphics as slow.|$|E
5|$|During a 2004 {{assessment}} of Texas waterways, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality found {{higher than normal}} levels of bacteria {{at the mouth of}} Carancahua Creek and alkaline pH levels, symptomatic of algal bloom. The issues discovered by the Commission were common in the water bodies examined for the study, and <b>they</b> <b>noted</b> that such issues would be addressed.|$|E
5|$|In {{their book}} Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live, authors Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad {{wrote that the}} sketch was writer Michael O'Donoghue's {{signature}} success on the television program. In addition, <b>they</b> <b>noted</b> that the staff of Saturday Night Live felt the sketch was among the best routines on the program.|$|E

50|$|Some Wold Newton {{theorists have}} {{suggested}} the French thief Arsène Lupin {{as the father}} of Nero Wolfe. <b>They</b> <b>note</b> that in one story Lupin has an affair with the queen of a Balkan principality, which may be Montenegro by another name. Further, <b>they</b> <b>note</b> that the name Lupin resembles the French word for wolf, loup.|$|R

5|$|Reviewers were {{consistent}} in their praises and {{criticism of the}} album. <b>They</b> <b>noted</b> the high production values {{and the quality of}} the original compositions and the performance of the orchestra. They also felt that the later tracks in the album were notably weaker than the early tracks, that the arrangements in general did not stray far from the source material, and that several of the track choices did not seem to fit as well as orchestral renditions as others.|$|E
5|$|The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) {{announced}} in 2010 that a biodiversity study from 2009 {{in the gallery}} forest of Ranobe near Toliara in southwestern Madagascar revealed a population of giant mouse lemurs previously unknown to science, and possibly a new species. <b>They</b> <b>noted</b> {{a significant difference in}} coloration between the two known species and the specimen they observed. However, further testing was required to confirm the discovery.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} well received by critics, who remarked on its diversity and significantly different musical style {{to that of}} drummer Crahan's other band Slipknot. <b>They</b> <b>noted</b> that it features music inspired by The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and Weezer, among others. However the album did not appear on any sales charts.|$|E
25|$|<b>They</b> <b>note</b> that Mas‘udi often {{encourages}} {{his readers}} to consult other books he has written, expecting these to {{be accessible to}} his readership. <b>They</b> also <b>note</b> the stark contrast between contemporary European conditions confronting say {{the author of the}} Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and this highly literate Islamic world.|$|R

5|$|The {{decision}} enhanced tribal self-determination because tribes {{could act}} {{even in the}} presence of related federal activity. <b>They</b> <b>noted</b> that Lara had been in numerous altercations with the tribal police at Spirit Lake for intoxication, spousal abuse, and resisting arrest. Only when the tribe ran out of options did it issue an exclusion order to bar him from the reservation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} and {{promotion}} of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo {{went to great lengths}} to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview. During this interview <b>they</b> <b>noted</b> that the use of cloth bags in particular had been a spontaneous decision, reflecting their willingness to experiment with their perceived image in the media.|$|E
5|$|GameSpot {{gave the}} game an 8 out of 10, praising the game's characters, art, voice acting and {{challenging}} gameplay. However, <b>they</b> <b>noted</b> {{that at times}} that spoken dialogue sometimes did not match the displayed text dialogue. A reviewer of PC Gamer scored the game 69 out of 100, noting that Space Run attempts to reverse the typical tower defense concept, but ultimately relies on memorizing missions rather than clever design. The reviewer considered {{the best part of}} the game to be the time bonus, which is necessary to earn full reputation.|$|E

5000|$|The Buffalo News {{describes}} the finale as a [...] "heart-pounding resolution", {{noting that the}} final moment between Sipowicz and Simone was [...] "also emotional despite its simplicity". <b>They</b> <b>note</b> that the medical ethics consideration outdoes ER. <b>They</b> <b>note</b> that the [...] "acting is uniformly excellent", praising Smits in particular for conveying emotion without much dialogue as well as Delaney for [...] "capturing Diane's anxiety and heartache". They praise the pigeon scenes' ability to complement to the symbolic achievement of the episode that {{lives up to its}} billing.|$|R
50|$|Some {{researchers}} have asserted that a mock execution of Smith was a ritual intended to adopt Smith into the tribe, but other modern writers dispute this interpretation. They {{point out that}} nothing is known of 17th-century Powhatan adoption ceremonies. <b>They</b> <b>note</b> that an execution ritual is different from known rites of passage. Other historians, such as Helen Rountree, have questioned whether there was any risk of execution. <b>They</b> <b>note</b> that Smith failed to mention it in his 1608 and 1612 accounts, and only added it to his 1624 memoir, after Pocahontas had become famous.|$|R
5|$|Lowe speculated in his 1927 paper that, in {{the absence}} of {{mammalian}} predators on the island, the brown skua would be the Inaccessible Island rail's only predator. A study of the diet of brown skuas on Inaccessible Island confirmed this, but found that although skuas do eat adults of this species, the rail and other landbirds formed {{only a small part of}} the diet of that seabird, especially compared to their abundance on the island. <b>They</b> <b>noted</b> that the landbirds alarm-called when brown skuas were seen. After hearing another rail make an alarm call, adult Inaccessible Island rails become alert, while chicks fall silent. Adults are rarely preyed upon, but the mortality of chicks is high and predation by Tristan thrushes is a major cause.|$|E
5|$|Many {{associations}} between adult oviraptorosaur skeletons or embryos with elongatoolithid eggs (including Macroolithus) demonstrate that Macroolithus and other elongatoolithids were laid by oviraptorosaurs. One oviraptorosaur skeleton from the Upper Cretaceous of China {{was described in}} 2005; two shelled elongatoolithid eggs were preserved inside of its pelvis. This suggests that oviraptorosaurs had two functional oviducts where both would produce eggs simultaneously. While Sato et al. did not refer the eggs specifically to Macroolithus, <b>they</b> <b>noted</b> that the eggs closely resemble M. yaotunensis, though with a thinner eggshell. The thin eggshell, however, could simply be because the shell had not finished forming when the mother died, or because of biochemical dissolution of the shell before fossilization.|$|E
5|$|Opponents in Brooktondale to the {{construction}} felt the removal of trees would ruin the village. Feeling that the village of Brooktondale was not likely to grow in population {{as a result of}} this project, they questioned its purpose. Ruining the scenic narrative of the area would be a waste of taxpayer dollars, since the road just ends at two dirt roads in Guideboard Corners. Despite the opposition, the state met with Caroline town officials and <b>they</b> <b>noted</b> that about 20 people were opposed to the project while a petition of 547 people supporting the job existed. In early July1962, the state gave the go-ahead for the project to begin, but that the job would begin as early as 1963.|$|E

5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} by Koepfli and Wayne in 1998 found the giant otter {{has the highest}} divergence sequences within the otter subfamily, forming a distinct clade that split away 10 to 14 million years ago. <b>They</b> <b>noted</b> that the species may be the basal divergence among the otters or fall outside of them altogether, having split even before other mustelids, such as the ermine, polecat, and mink. Later gene sequencing research on the mustelids, from 2005, places the divergence of the giant otter somewhat later, between five and 11 million years ago; the corresponding phylogenetic tree locates the Lontra divergence first among otter genera, and Pteronura second, although divergence ranges overlap.|$|E
5|$|Redhead and Smith {{placed the}} genus in the Strophariaceae, as {{the biology of}} the fruit bodies and spore print color fit the broad concept of that family envisaged by Robert Kühner in 1984. <b>They</b> <b>noted,</b> however, that the genus did not fit well in a more {{restricted}} concept of the family due to its lack of a germ pore and roughened spore walls. More recently, taxonomic authorities have placed the genus in the family Psathyrellaceae; molecular analysis shows it to be most closely allied to this group. Mythicomyces and Stagnicola form a clade that is sister {{to the rest of}} the family.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} the original ZX Spectrum Underwurlde release. <b>They</b> <b>noted</b> its expansive game world and appreciated the parts where Sabreman travelled by bubble. Later critics {{commented on the}} game's frustrating difficulty. While the Commodore 64 version {{was similar to the}} original, reviews were mixed—one critic thought the title had aged poorly in the year between releases. Your Sinclair placed Underwurlde within its top 20 for the ZX Spectrum, though their readers put it near the bottom of their top 100. The game was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{scholars}} {{have attempted to}} synthesize the methods available for the resolution, management or transformation of their ethnic conflict. John Coakley, for example, has developed a [...] of the methods of conflict resolution that have been employed by states, which he lists as: indigenization, accommodation, assimilation, acculturation, population transfer, boundary alteration, genocide and ethnic suicide. John McGarry and Brendan O'Leary have developed a taxonomy of eight macro-political ethnic conflict regulation methods, which <b>they</b> <b>note</b> are often employed by states in combination with each other. They include a number of methods that <b>they</b> <b>note</b> are clearly morally unacceptable.|$|R
5|$|The US, the UK, {{and most}} other NATO {{countries}} opposed efforts to require the U.N. Security Council to approve NATO military strikes, such as the action against Serbia in 1999, while France and some others claimed that the alliance needed UN approval. The US/UK side claimed that this would undermine {{the authority of the}} alliance, and <b>they</b> <b>noted</b> that Russia and China would have exercised their Security Council vetoes to block the strike on Yugoslavia, and could do the same in future conflicts where NATO intervention was required, thus nullifying the entire potency and purpose of the organization. Recognizing the post-Cold War military environment, NATO adopted the Alliance Strategic Concept during its Washington summit in April 1999 that emphasized conflict prevention and crisis management.|$|E
5|$|The {{authors of}} Kepler-14b's {{discovery}} paper noted that, {{had they not}} discovered that Kepler-14 was indeed a binary system, the parameters for Kepler-14b would have been extremely inaccurate. <b>They</b> <b>noted</b> that other planets discovered using radial velocity measurements might not have accounted {{for the possibility that}} their host stars were binary systems; the only way that this was definitely known in the case of Kepler-14 was through the use of high-resolution imaging. If the less prominent portion of the Kepler-14 binary system had not been detected, Kepler-14b's mass would have been incorrect by nearly 60%, and its radius too small by about 10%.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{intensification}} of Patricia was well-anticipated but poorly forecast. Meteorologists at the NHC indicated {{the possibility of}} such in the system's first advisory as a tropical depression. <b>They</b> <b>noted</b> the only inhibiting factor would be how quickly the storm could organize an inner core. Just {{before the onset of}} rapid intensification, the agency was unable to utilize the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme rapid intensification guidance due to technical errors. This likely contributed to even greater errors in the agency's forecast. Initial forecasts were consistently conservative with intensity and dramatic strengthening was not explicitly shown until rapid intensification was already underway.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{scientists}} regard {{with skepticism}} {{the contention that}} megalanias were the only, or even principal, predators of the Australian Pleistocene megafauna. <b>They</b> <b>note</b> that the [...] "marsupial lion" [...] (Thylacoleo carnifex) has been implicated with the butchery of very large Pleistocene mammals, while megalania has not. In addition, <b>they</b> <b>note</b> that megalania fossils are extremely uncommon, in contrast to Thylacoleo carnifex with its wide distribution across Australian Pleistocene deposits. Quinkana, a genus of terrestrial crocodile that grew up to 6m and was present until around 40,000 years ago, has also been marked as another apex predator of Australian megafauna.|$|R
