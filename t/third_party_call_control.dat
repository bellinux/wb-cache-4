50|$|In the {{traditional}} telephony context, <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>call</b> <b>control</b> allows one entity (which {{we call the}} controller) {{to set up and}} manage a communications relationship or telephone call between two or more other parties. <b>Third</b> <b>party</b> <b>call</b> <b>control</b> (referred to as 3pcc) is often used for operator services (where an operator creates a call that connects two participants together) and conferencing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Third</b> <b>party</b> <b>call</b> <b>control</b> is {{possible}} using only the mechanisms specified within RFC 37251. Indeed, many different call flows are possible, {{each of which}} will work with SIP compliant user agents. However, there are benefits and drawbacks {{to each of these}} flows. The usage of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>call</b> <b>control</b> also becomes more complex when aspects of the call utilize SIP extensions or optional features of SIP. In particular, the usage of RFC 3312 2 (used for coupling of signaling to resource reservation) with <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>call</b> <b>control</b> is non-trivial, and is discussed in Section 9 of RFC 3725 3. Similarly, the usage of early media (where session data is exchanged before the call is accepted) with <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>call</b> <b>control</b> is not trivial; both of them specify the way in which user agents generate and respond to SDP, and {{it is not clear how}} to do both at the same time. This is discussed further in Section 8.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} a methodology for the demand-side management (DSM) considering the Flexible, Reliable and Intelligent ENergy Delivery System (FRIENDS) {{proposed by the}} authors. The proposed DSM {{is based on a}} real-time pricing system executed by <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> <b>called</b> Quality <b>Control</b> Centers (QCC) in FRIENDS, which are allocated close to consumers. The economic use of distributed generators (DG) or distributed energy storage systems (ESS) installed in the QCC is also considered in the DSM. A logistic sigmoid function is used for modeling the real-time pricing system and a couple of parameters in the function are optimized using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) so that profit of the QCC is maximized. The effectiveness of the proposed DSM is ascertained by evaluating the profit or the load factor of QCC through simulations using model systems...|$|R

50|$|Similarly, many SIP {{services}} are possible through <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>call</b> <b>control.</b> These include the traditional {{ones on the}} PSTN, but also new ones such as click-to-dial.

50|$|<b>Third</b> <b>Party</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Control</b> is {{perfectly}} suited for delivery of 9-1-1 {{calls in a}} Next Generation 9-1-1 environment. It allows for re-connection of the media stream to an alternate end point if the original destination end point becomes unavailable without dropping the original emergency call (which has a separate media stream to the 3PCC server). Additionally, it minimizes bandwidth requirements between the 3PCC server and the emergency call handling end point because all mixed media uses the same RTP stream. Finally, it does not rely on a destination end point for end to end reliability but rather on a more robust centralized data center with several redundantly deployed servers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the near}} future, the Internet {{is likely to}} become an All-IP network that {{provides}} various multimedia services over wireless networks. Although the earliest VoIP applications did not consider the end-node mobil-ity, researchers have attempted to support mobility in current VoIP protocols, such as Session Initial Protocol (SIP) -based mobility. The SIP-based mobility is considered because it can readily support mobility. However, calling disruptions may occur in traditional SIP mid-call terminal mobility because handoff procedure may be required, depending on the implementation and the real network deployment considerations. In any case, issues in the combined SIP/RSVP for guaranteeing QoS of VoIP service under mobile environment are also considered to be crucial. Therefore, this study describes the solutions by devising novel hierarchy network architecture. Also, the mechanisms including help with neighboring users in adjacent cells and the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>call</b> <b>control</b> to over-come those issues are included. The simulation results indicate that the proposed technique is practical and better executive than conventional schemes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} network-initiated {{terminal}} mobility mechanism (NITM) to facilitate handover with the session initiation protocol (SIP) in 3 GPP Voice over WLAN (3 GPP VoWLAN). We design the E 2 E tunnel state model {{running on the}} packet data gateway (PDG) using the CAMEL concept, and introduce the mobility server (MS) as a SIP application server to re-establish sessions with <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>call</b> <b>control</b> (3 PCC). The MS is triggered to provide the terminal mobility service from the PDG by detecting the state transition of the E 2 E tunnel state model that represents the occurrence of a handover. This mechanism can advance the time to re-establish sessions. That is, our approach can provide smaller handover delay than mobileinitiated terminal mobility; moreover, it can handle mobility without additional support from the mobile host (MH). In addition, the handover missing problem (messages lost) might happen when the MH moves under communication.

40|$|Combining {{multiple}} {{fixed and}} mobile terminals {{to create a}} real-time communication session can be troublesome. 	 Consider the following scenario: Alice is at work, and wants to place a video call to Tom, who is not currently in his office. Since Alice is requesting a video conversation, Tom steps into the nearest video equipped meeting room. The available system {{in the room is}} sensed by his mobile terminal and enables Tom to setup a call between the room system and Alice. The call control remains on his mobile node. This and similar scenarioes raise several issues. Typical challenges include where to log in, where to initiate and terminate a call, and where to control call sessions. Media capabilities found on a mobile terminal is sometimes insufficient, for instance to handle video calls. Ubiquitous computing makes it possible to sense and utilize entities in the environment with minimal effort for the user. High quality video equipment is typically located at fixed locations due to their size. Thus, a Personal Area Network can be utilized to autonomously provide information regarding nearby equipment through distributed Service Discovery. The sensed equipment can be utilized in calls, to provide enhanced media capabilities, when needed. A call between two parties that is setup and controlled by a third party, is referred to as <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>call</b> <b>control</b> (3 PCC). 3 PCC can be facilitated to enable a low capability mobile node with higher capabilities for call setup, when such are sensed. RFC 3725 was used as a guideline for the 3 PCC component, and extended the features to allow incoming calls as well as outgoing calls. Another important feature is that core call control is kept on the mobile node. It can be argued that such a system should be compliant with basic SIP (as described in RFC 3261) for all communication across domains. Hence, the system will not put any restrictions on the far end, which is important to ensure interoperability with 3 rd party SIP equipment. This feature will also shorten the expected time-to-market for the system, as no standardization is required. The proposed solution consists of two components; a distributed service discovery component that senses nearby call enabled equipment, and a 3 PCC component that enables call setup and core call control. The solution is implemented and tested with standardized SIP equipment. </p...|$|E
