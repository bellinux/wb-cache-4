25|$|Thomas Zanzinger Morrow (September 3, 1836August 25, 1913) was a lawyer, judge, and {{politician}} from Kentucky. He {{was one of}} twenty-eight men {{who founded}} the Kentucky Republican Party. His brother-in-law, William O. Bradley, was elected governor of Kentucky in 1895, and his son, Edwin P. Morrow was elected <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> office in 1919.|$|E
25|$|A gun {{was found}} in his {{possession}} that was linked to a shooting. A Colt Police Positive revolver had been stolen in a burglary at the apartment of Guy Rodrick on December 3, 1945. Two nights later, a bullet crashed through the closed eighth-floor apartment window of Marion Caldwell, wounding her. Heirens had that gun in his possession and, according to the Chicago Police Department, the bullet that injured Caldwell was linked through ballistics <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> gun.|$|E
25|$|With Eastwick {{recently}} canceled, ABC began considering moving Ugly Betty to the Wednesday night 10:00PM Eastern/9:00PM Central timeslot, {{although there}} was talk of moving Lost <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> timeslot. On December 1, 2009, ABC, sensing a backlash from viewers over its decision to move Ugly Betty to Fridays, its sliding ratings, and praises from critics over the improved storylines, made the move to Wednesday official by announcing that it would start airing new episodes on its new night starting January 6, 2010.|$|E

25|$|One running gag has Sergeant Snorkel hanging helplessly from a {{small tree}} branch after having fallen off a cliff (first time August 16, 1956). While he is never shown falling off, or even walking {{close to the edge}} of a cliff, he always seems to hold on <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> branch, yelling for help. This gag may have spawned the segment of the children's show Between the Lions {{featuring}} a person named Cliff Hanger, who, like Sergeant Snorkel, is hanging from a cliff in each feature.|$|E
25|$|Using this Carnapian approach, Maher {{identifies}} {{a proposition}} which we intuitively (and correctly) {{know to be}} false, but which we easily confuse with the paradoxical conclusion. The proposition in question is the proposition that observing non-ravens tells us about the color of ravens. While this is intuitively false and is also false according to Carnap's theory of induction, observing non-ravens (according <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> theory) causes us to reduce our estimate {{of the total number}} of ravens, and thereby reduces the estimated number of possible counterexamples to the rule that all ravens are black.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 20th and early 21st century Metra {{experienced}} record ridership and expanded its services. In 1996 Metra organized its first new line, the North Central Service, running from Union Station to Antioch. By 2006 it added new intermediate stops <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> route, extended the Union Pacific / West Line from Geneva to Elburn and extended SouthWest Service from Orland Park to Manhattan. In 2012 it boasted 95.8% average on-time performance (measured {{only for a}} train's arrivals at its last station {{no more than six}} minutes late). It also posted its fourth highest volume in its history despite decreases in employment opportunities in downtown Chicago.|$|E

25|$|Miller {{established}} himself as a conservative on virtually all economic issues. He was the first Democrat in the Senate to publicly declare his support for the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, a broad-based tax cut which was criticized by opponents for favoring the rich and being fiscally irresponsible. Miller was the only Democrat to vote against an amendment <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> bill submitted by Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) to scale back portions of that tax cut in order to spend more on education and debt reduction. He strongly opposed the estate tax and voted a number of times for its repeal. He also advocated drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E

[...] The zeroes on {{the matrix}} main diagonal are {{a consequence of}} perfect matching – power input to any port is not reflected back <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> port.

500|$|Abbott is the {{inventor}} of a style of maze called logic mazes. A logic maze has a set of rules, ranging from the basic (such as [...] "you cannot make left turns") to the extremely complicated. These mazes are also called [...] "Multi-State mazes". [...] The reason for this name is that sometimes you can return to a position you were in before, but be traveling in a different direction. That change in direction can {{put you in a}} different state and open up different choices for you. One example, from the book SuperMazes, would be a rolling-die maze. Where you can move from a particular square depends on what number is facing up on the die. If you return <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> square, the die may be in a different state, with a different number on top. Thus, you would have different options than the first time.|$|E

500|$|Wilson's and Love's working {{relationship}} was briefly reestablished for the follow-up single [...] "Good Vibrations". [...] Wilson {{said that before}} its final mixdown, he had been confronted with resistance by unnamed members of the group. The subject of their worries and complaints was the song's length and [...] "modern" [...] sound: [...] "I said no, it's {{not going to be}} too long a record, it's going to be just right. ... They didn't quite understand what this jumping from studio to studio was all about. And they couldn't conceive of the record as I did. I saw the record as a totality piece." [...] Love was worried that the [...] "track itself was already so avant-garde, especially with the theremin, [...] I wondered how our fans were going to relate to it." [...] Shortly before the single's release, Wilson suggested: [...] "It's still sticking pretty close <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> boy-girl thing, you know, but with a difference. And it's a start, it's definitely a start." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Iwata took a {{position}} at Nintendo {{as the head of}} its corporate planning division and took a seat on the board of directors. Over the next two years, he sought to reduce the cost and length of game development while preserving quality. During his first two years at Nintendo, the company saw profit increases of 20 and 41percent, values which are at least partially attributable to his work. When Yamauchi, the company's president since 1949, retired on May24, 2002, Iwata succeeded as Nintendo's fourth president with Yamauchi's blessing. He was the first Nintendo president unrelated to the Yamauchi family through blood or marriage since its founding in 1889. Yamauchi left the company in Iwata's hands with a final request: [...] "that Nintendo give birth to wholly new ideas and create hardware which reflects that ideal. And make software that adheres <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> standard." [...] Iwata inherited a company that promoted individualism, with a policy established by Yamauchi to create new development positions as needed. However, this inhibited efficient collaboration between certain departments.|$|E
500|$|In a July 1966 {{advertisement}} for Pet Sounds in Billboard magazine, the band thanked {{the music industry}} for the sales of their album, and said that [...] "We're moved {{over the fact that}} our Pet Sounds brought on nothing but Good Vibrations." [...] This was the first public hint of the new single. Later in the year, Brian told journalist Tom Nolan that the new Beach Boys single was [...] "about a guy who picks up good vibrations from a girl" [...] {{and that it would be}} a [...] "monster". He then suggested: [...] "It's still sticking pretty close <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> boy-girl thing, you know, but with a difference. And it's a start, it's definitely a start." [...] Derek Taylor, who had recently been engaged as the band's publicist, is credited for coining the term a [...] "pocket symphony" [...] to describe the song. In a press release for the single, he stated: [...] "Wilson's instinctive talents for mixing sounds could most nearly equate to those of the old painters whose special secret was in the blending of their oils. And what is most amazing about all outstanding creative artists is that they are using only those basic materials which are freely available to everyone else." ...|$|E

500|$|Chilton took up {{electric}} guitar at thirteen, playing along with Beatles songs, later saying, [...] "I really loved the mid-sixties British pop music [...] all {{two and a}} half minutes or three minutes long, really appealing songs. So I've always aspired <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>same</b> format, that's what I like. Not to mention the rhythm and blues and the Stax stuff, too". Chilton abandoned his guitar-playing when with The Box Tops, then took up the instrument again; he met Roger McGuinn, guitarist for the Byrds, and developed particular interest in {{electric guitar}} and acoustic folk. Stephens enjoyed the music of Otis Redding, the Isley Brothers, the Who, the Kinks, and especially the Beatles. Hummel likewise was a member of more than one band during his early musical years, again influenced by the Beatles and other British Invasion acts. The bassist also played acoustic guitar for personal enjoyment, following the styles of Simon & Garfunkel and Joni Mitchell and using finger-picking techniques to play folk and bluegrass. Most songs on the first three albums are credited to either Bell/Chilton or Chilton, but some credit Hummel, Stephens and others, as either writer or co-writer. At the only seven live performances in the original era, the last of which took place before the second album's release, all four members contributed vocally.|$|E
