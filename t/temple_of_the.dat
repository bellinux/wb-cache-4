5|$|Apart from {{stimulating}} {{the development of}} urban areas, temples and religious buildings featured a number of unique aesthetic and structural features. The <b>Temple</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saintly Mother (圣母殿) and the Hall of Sacrifice of the Jin Temple (晋祠), located in a southeastern suburb of Taiyuan City, Shanxi province, are extant examples of early Song architecture. The <b>Temple</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saintly Mother is the main building of the Jin Temple, first built in the period between 1023 and 1032 and renovated in 1102. It has a double-eaved roof with nine ridges, and two dragon-heads with wide-open jaws biting {{the ends of the}} main ridge. The roof is supported by massive dougong brackets corresponding to drawings in Yingzao Fashi. The eaves of the <b>Temple</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saintly Mother curve upward slightly at each end, a characteristic of Song architecture. The columns of the façade, decorated with dragons that coil around the shafts, become progressively taller with increasing distance to either side of the central pair. The building has a porch around it, the sole example of such a structure; another unique feature of the site is a cross-shaped bridge that leads to the Goddess Temple.|$|E

5|$|After {{scouring}} the Great Sea, Link learns {{that he must}} use maps and clues hidden in the <b>Temple</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ocean King to find the Spirits of Courage, Wisdom, and Power, which in turn will help him locate the Ghost Ship. With {{the help of the}} Phantom Hourglass, Link finds the Spirits of Wisdom and Power. When Link asks Oshus where to find the Spirit of Courage, Oshus explains that it is in fact Ciela, after which she transforms into her true form. Now in possession of the three Spirits, Link, along with Ciela and Oshus, locate the Ghost Ship and find Tetra on board, who has been turned to stone. While Link determines how to save Tetra, Oshus reveals that he is the Ocean King and that he and Ciela had to change their appearances to hide from Bellum, a life-eating monster that Link must destroy to save Tetra. Oshus also mentions that Bellum was the one who created the Ghost Ship and turned Tetra into a statue, and that he has taken residence deep in the <b>Temple</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ocean King. Linebeck quickly readies to abandon their quest; outraged at the lack of treasure to be found.

5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural attractions, human involvement in the area is also responsible for making tourism {{a large part of}} the regional economy. Every year, around 6.5—7million people visit the Zenkō-ji Buddhist template in Nagano. It is believed that visiting the template will grant salvation. This has resulted in the head <b>temple</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tendai sect being a significant attraction for tourists throughout its 1,400-year history.|$|E

Furthermore, both pyramids were built into the sides of existing hills.
