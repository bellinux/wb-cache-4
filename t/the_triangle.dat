Shortly after Kyle picks it up, the guide identifies the writing on <b>the</b> <b>triangle</b> as Anasazi.

Cartman constantly pesters Kyle until he returns <b>the</b> <b>triangle</b> to him. Meanwhile, Leonard Maltin comes to South Park and asks Chef whether he has seen Barbra Streisand. Maltin, having seen Kyle and <b>the</b> <b>triangle</b> on television, tells Chef the boys are in great danger.|$|E
5|$|Bømlo Municipal Council voted {{unanimously}} {{in favor of}} <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> Link on 22 February 1988. Two days later, the issue was discussed in Stord Municipal Council. Olav Akselsen at first proposed supporting the pontoon bridge, but after a trial vote he withdrew the proposal and also Stord supported <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> Link. The following week, Sveio Municipal Council voted in favor <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> Link, without either a debate or dissent in the council. Fitjar Municipal Council voted on 15 March to work with both proposals. Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that {{two and a half}} years of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> Link was published in early 1989, estimating the costs at NOK890 million. It recommended that the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry remain, but the other four ferry services be terminated. The report concluded that the maintenance costs of the fixed link would be lower than the subsidies of the ferry, that the project would be economical of society and would reduce emissions.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-1940s {{through the}} 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> was the {{commercial}} and cultural heart of Jerusalem, with many upscale shops and restaurants operated by German-Jewish immigrant businessmen that appealed to an affluent clientele. Following the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 {{and the expansion of}} the city away from the downtown core, the commercial viability of <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> declined. The area was revitalized by the conversion of Ben Yehuda Street and the interior streets of <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> to an open-air pedestrian mall in 1982. Over the next two decades, outdoor cafes and souvenir shops moved in, cementing the reputation of <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> as a popular shopping and entertainment venue for tourists and young Israelis.|$|E
25|$|From an {{interior}} {{point in a}} reference <b>triangle,</b> <b>the</b> nearest points on the three sides serve as the vertices of <b>the</b> pedal <b>triangle</b> of that point. If the interior point is the circumcenter of <b>the</b> reference <b>triangle,</b> <b>the</b> vertices of <b>the</b> pedal <b>triangle</b> are <b>the</b> midpoints of <b>the</b> reference <b>triangle's</b> sides, and so <b>the</b> pedal <b>triangle</b> is called <b>the</b> midpoint <b>triangle</b> or medial <b>triangle.</b> <b>The</b> midpoint <b>triangle</b> subdivides <b>the</b> reference <b>triangle</b> into four congruent triangles which are similar to <b>the</b> reference <b>triangle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{center of}} a triangle's Steiner inellipse is <b>the</b> <b>triangle's</b> {{centroid}} — <b>the</b> intersection of <b>the</b> <b>triangle's</b> medians. <b>The</b> Steiner inellipse is the only inellipse whose center is at <b>the</b> <b>triangle's</b> centroid.|$|R
25|$|Further, every {{triangle}} has {{a unique}} Steiner circumellipse, which passes through <b>the</b> <b>triangle's</b> vertices and has its center at <b>the</b> <b>triangle's</b> centroid. Of all ellipses going through <b>the</b> <b>triangle's</b> vertices, it has the smallest area.|$|R

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{contributors}} to globalization was the Triangular Trade and how it connected the world.

50|$|The {{midpoint}} polygon of a <b>triangle</b> {{is called}} <b>the</b> medial <b>triangle.</b> It shares <b>the</b> same centroid and medians with <b>the</b> original <b>triangle.</b> <b>The</b> perimeter of <b>the</b> medial <b>triangle</b> equals <b>the</b> semiperimeter of <b>the</b> original <b>triangle,</b> and <b>the</b> area is {{one quarter of}} the area of <b>the</b> original <b>triangle.</b> This can be proven by the midpoint theorem of triangles and Heron's formula.

5|$|In his 1874 paper, {{entitled}} Note sur les propriétés du centre des médianes antiparallèles dans un triangle, Lemoine {{proved the}} concurrency of the symmedians of a triangle; the {{reflections of the}} medians of <b>the</b> <b>triangle</b> over the angle bisectors.

5|$|Manhattan {{has been}} the scene of many {{important}} American cultural movements. In 1912, about 20,000 workers, a quarter of them women, marched upon Washington Square Park to commemorate <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> Shirtwaist Factory fire, which killed 146 workers on March 25, 1911. Many of the women wore fitted tucked-front blouses like those manufactured by <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> Shirtwaist Company, a clothing style that became the working woman's uniform and a symbol of women's liberation, reflecting the alliance of labor and suffrage movements.|$|E
50|$|The {{circumcenter}} of <b>the</b> tangential <b>triangle</b> is on <b>the</b> reference <b>triangle's</b> Euler line, as is {{the center}} of similitude of <b>the</b> tangential <b>triangle</b> and <b>the</b> orthic <b>triangle</b> (whose vertices are {{at the feet of the}} altitudes of <b>the</b> reference <b>triangle).</b>|$|R

5|$|The 7th Infantry Division's Operation Showdown {{launched}} {{in the early morning}} hours of 14 October 1952, with the 31st Infantry and 32nd Infantry at the head of the attack.

The 7th Infantry Division was highly praised by commanders for its tenacity through the fight.|$|E
5|$|The Coastal Administration {{stated that}} they would not allow a pontoon bridge. SBT decided on 26 June 1987 to work towards {{receiving}} permission to collect advanced tolls on the ferry services. On 16 September, they unanimously supported the triangular proposal, which was estimated to cost NOK660 million. This was criticized by Hordaland Public Roads Administration, who stated that it would take longer time to plan—and thus complete—the Triangle Link. A poll from January 1988 showed that 78.6 {{percent of the population of}} Bømlo wanted <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> Link, while 8.6 percent wanted the pontoon bridge. On 6 January, SBT started negotiating loans with various banks to receive financial guarantees for <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> Link, and by February sufficient funding had been secured.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> heptagonal <b>triangle's</b> orthic triangle, with {{vertices}} at {{the feet}} of the altitudes, is similar to <b>the</b> heptagonal <b>triangle,</b> with similarity ratio 1:2. <b>The</b> heptagonal <b>triangle</b> is <b>the</b> only obtuse <b>triangle</b> that is similar to its orthic <b>triangle</b> (<b>the</b> equilateral <b>triangle</b> being <b>the</b> only acute one).|$|R

50|$|The {{orthocenter}} of <b>the</b> medial <b>triangle</b> {{coincides with}} <b>the</b> circumcenter of <b>triangle</b> ABC.

The nine-point circle circumscribes <b>the</b> medial <b>triangle,</b> and so <b>the</b> nine-point center is the circumcenter of <b>the</b> medial <b>triangle.</b>|$|R
5|$|The European immigrant-owned bookstores {{fueled the}} demand for detective fiction, {{historical}} reading, and periodicals from Germany and England. Steimatzky, which opened its first bookstore on Jaffa Road in <b>the</b> <b>Triangle</b> in 1925, identified the growing taste for imported newspapers and magazines and bought the franchises for many of them. The European immigrants also created a market for cold cuts and cheeses, with three competing delicatessens on King George and Ben Yehuda Streets.
