25|$|Urokinase is used {{clinically}} as a thrombolytic {{agent in}} the treatment of severe or massive deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and occluded intravenous or dialysis cannulas. It is also administered intrapleurally to improve the drainage of complicated pleural effusions and empyemas. Urokinase is marketed as Abbokinase or Kinlytic and competes with recombinant <b>tissue</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> (e.g., alteplase) as a thrombolytic drug in infarction. However, urokinase is not very selective for clot-bound plasminogen, unlike <b>tissue</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> (TPA) which preferentially interacts with clot-bound plasminogen. Because urokinase binds about equally to freely circulating plasminogen and clot-bound plasminogen, it causes significant fibrinogenolysis and clot fibrinolysis making its use less favorable than TPA.|$|E
25|$|PAI-1 is a serine {{protease}} inhibitor (serpin) that functions {{as the principal}} inhibitor of <b>tissue</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> (tPA) and urokinase (uPA), the activators of plasminogen and hence fibrinolysis (the physiological breakdown of blood clots).

Endothelin- 1 increased the <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> release and platelet activating factor formation, and induced subsequent gastric mucosal haemorrhagic change in a dose dependent manner. In addition CV- 6209, a selective platelet activating factor blocker, attenuated the activation of regional <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> and the development of mucosal damage induced by endothelin- 1. The results of this study showed that <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> activation may {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of endothelin induced mucosal injury of rat stomach, and suggest that the platelet activating factor may be involved in the process of regional fibrinolytic activation induced by endothelin- 1...|$|R

Tissue type and urokinase type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> activity (expressed as mIU/mg protein) and <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> inhibitor type- 1 antigen were assayed in homogenates of gastric and duodenal biopsy specimens taken from patients with: normal endoscopy (controls) (n = 14); active duodenal ulcer (n = 21); healed duodenal ulcer (n = 12); and active benign gastric ulcer (n = 15). In controls mean duodenal <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> activity was 4110 and urokinase type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> activity 150; gastric <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> was 2760 and urokinase type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> 170; <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> inhibitor type- 1 was generally undetectable. At the edge of active duodenal ulcers <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> was considerably reduced, 2220 (p < 0. 001) whereas urokinase type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> was raised, 290 (p < 0. 01).

40|$|Carcinogenesis in {{the human}} colon is {{associated}} with a marked increase of urokinase type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> and a decrease of <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator.</b> This study was performed to determine the concentrations of urokinase type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> and <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> in normal <b>tissue</b> and carcinomas along {{the upper part of the}} gastrointestinal tract. Activity and antigen levels of both activators were determined in homogenates of endoscopically obtained biopsies from normal and carcinomatous tissues. Although the concentrations of <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> and urokinase type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> in normal squamous epithelium of the oesophagus were low compared with those in columnar epithelium from the stomach, the urokinase type plasminogen activator/tissue type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> antigen ratio of the different locations showed hardly any difference. Significant but heterogeneous increases were found in urokinase type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> concentrations of biopsy specimens originating from carcinomas of both epithelial cell types. A decrease in <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> concentrations, as found in human colon carcinomas, could only be shown in carcinomas of columnar epithelium origin but not in squamous cell carcinomas of the oesophagus. The increase of urokinase type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> and urokinase type plasminogen activator/tissue type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> antigen ratio and the decrease of <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> in the carcinomas did not show a significant correlation with known prognostic determinants as differentiation grade, TNM classification, intestinal metaplasia, inflammation, and ulceration.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages on the fibrinolytic system and to assess whether these effects could help explain the relation between moderate alcohol consumption and reduced coronary heart disease. DESIGN [...] Four treatments were allocated in a randomised controlled order on four days {{over a period of}} 11 days. SETTING [...] Metabolic ward of research institute. SUBJECTS [...] Eight white healthy middle aged men. INTERVENTIONS [...] Subjects were provided with food for the 11 days. On the four study days mineral water or 40 g of alcohol in the form of beer, wine, or spirits was consumed at dinner early in the evening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] <b>Plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> inhibitor activity, <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> antigen, and <b>tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> activity one hour before and one, three, five, nine, and 13 hours after dinner with mineral water or alcoholic beverages. RESULTS [...] After dinner with alcohol <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> inhibitor activity rose from 53 (SD 19) % to a maximum of 667 (283 %) five hours after dinner (P < 0. 001). <b>Tissue</b> type <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> antigen levels rose from 5. 3 (2. 2) micrograms/l to a maximum of 10. 8 (3. 8) micrograms/l nine hours after dinner with alcohol (P < 0. 001). <b>Plasminogen</b> <b>activator</b> activity was reduced in the postprandial period (from 1387 (483) IU/l to 323 (288) IU/l five hours after eating; P < 0. 001) but was higher than normal early the next morning (1516 (809) IU/l after alcohol, 779 (516) IU/l after water; P = 0. 04).

Conversely, modern oral contraceptives are not associated with an increase in the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (heart attack) in healthy, non-smoking premenopausal women of any age, except in those with hypertension (high blood pressure).

40|$|Methods {{currently}} used in brain vascular disorder diagnostics are neither fast enough nor clear-out; thus, {{there exists a}} necessity of finding new types of testing which could enlarge and complete the actual panel of diagnostics or be an alternative to current methods. The discovery of sensitive and specific biomarkers of ischemic brain stroke will improve the effects of treatment and will help to assess the progress or complications of the disease. The relevant diagnosis of ischemic stroke (IS) within the first 4. 5 hours after the initial symptoms allows for the initiation of treatment with recombinant <b>tissue</b> <b>plasminogen</b> <b>activators</b> which limits the magnitude of negative changes {{in the brain and}} which enhance the final effectiveness of therapy. The potential biomarkers which are under investigation are substances involved in the processes of coagulation and fibrinolysis, and are of molecules released from damaged vascular endothelial cells and from nerves and cardiac tissue. The analyzed substances are typical of oxidative stress, apoptosis, excitotoxicity and damage of the blood brain barrier...|$|R
