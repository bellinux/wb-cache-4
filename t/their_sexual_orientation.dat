5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2013, Human Rights Watch carried out five weeks of {{fieldwork}} among Jamaica's LGBT community, reporting that over half of those interviewed had experienced violence {{as a result of}} <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> or gender identity, sometimes on more than one occasion.|$|E
5|$|Women in {{homosexual}} relationships {{responded to}} this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and identity that developed in Europe and the United States. Following World War II, {{during a period of}} social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals, women developed networks to socialize with and educate each other. Greater economic and social freedom allowed them gradually to be able to determine how they could form relationships and families. With second wave feminism and growth of scholarship in women's history and sexuality in the 20th century, the definition of lesbian broadened, sparking a debate about sexual desire as the major component to define what a lesbian is. Some women who engage in same-sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as bisexual as well, while other women's self-identification as lesbian may not align with <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> or sexual behavior; sexual identity is not necessarily the same as one's sexual orientation or sexual behavior, due to various reasons, such as the fear of identifying <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> in a homophobic setting.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and 1970s, gay bathhousesnow {{primarily}} gay-owned and operatedbecame fully licensed gay establishments which soon became major gay institutions. These bathhouses served as informal gay meeting places, places where friends could meet and relax. Gay bathhouses frequently threw parties for Pride Day and were usually open, and busy, on public holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, when some gay men, {{particularly those who}} had been rejected by their families due to <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation,</b> had nowhere else to go. The American writer Truman Capote was a regular at New York City baths in the 1970s, in particular the sauna at West 58th Street.|$|E

5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E
5|$|Berry was {{appointed}} Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, serving from 1997 to 2001. At the Interior Department, Berry improved credit union and continuing education options, oversaw {{the expansion of}} department programs to improve employees' work-life balance, and held town hall meetings with Interior employees and used their suggestions to upgrade a cafeteria and health center. These changes were partly funded through partnerships with federal employees, unions and other agencies to reduce costs for the department. Berry worked to create a complaint procedure for employees who experience discrimination because of <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation,</b> to expand relocation benefits and counseling services to domestic partners of employees, to establish a liaison to gay and lesbian workers, and to eliminate discriminatory provisions of the National Park Service's law enforcement standards. He helped establish an office supply store for Interior employees, which he staffed with disabled workers. Berry oversaw {{one of the largest}} budgetary increases in the department's history.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the lack of medical {{information}} on WSW is that medical professionals and some lesbians perceive lesbians as having lower risks of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases or types of cancer. When women do seek medical attention, medical professionals often fail to take a complete medical history. In a recent study of 2,345 lesbian and bisexual women, only 9.3% had claimed they had ever been asked <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation</b> by a physician. A third of the respondents believed disclosing their sexual history would result in a negative reaction, and 30% had received a negative reaction from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual. A patient's complete history helps medical professionals identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women. In a similar survey of 6,935 lesbians, 77% had had sexual contact with one or more male partners, and 6% had that contact within the previous year.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientation.</b> In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, gay men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E

40|$|Men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM) {{continue}} to be highly affected with the HIV infection worldwide. Studies have shown that organization of health care system and how the MSM perceive it, play a major role in granting or denying them access to health care services. Little is known in Tanzania with regards to barriers of MSM accessing health services in Tanzania. The study was geared towards determining the proportion of MSM who accessed health care and disclose <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientations</b> to health care workers (HCW). It also intended to find out the anticipated barriers from HCW’s if they were to disclose <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientations</b> to them and look into the types of social networks used when facing various challenges. The study employed both quantitative and qualitative methods. Participants were enrolled in the study Respondent Driven Sampling. Quantitative data was entered and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences v. 20. Qualitative data was collected using in-depth interviews read and interpreted to identify themes and create categories. These were manually analyzed and interpreted according to the study objectives. Majority of MSM (87. 7 %) in this study accessed health care services when sick, only 3. 4 % did nothing because they had no money to pay for the services. Only a third of them had ever disclosed <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientations</b> to HCW’s, due to perceived lack of confidentiality, fear of stigma and discrimination, shame and mistreatment at the health facilities and fear of HCW’s reaction after disclosure of <b>their</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>orientations.</b> MSM need to be empowered to overcome their perceived fears on HCW’s and health facilities. Efforts should be put in breaking the cycle of wrong information and perceptions MSM have on health care worker’s knowledge on dealing with same sex practices’ health related problems...|$|R
