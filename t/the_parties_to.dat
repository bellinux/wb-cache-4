The Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to apply for a declaration in an administrative law case, but it is possible they may adopt the test laid down in constitutional law cases. In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2012), the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist for a person have standing to bring a constitutional challenge: (1) he or she must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated.|$|E

5|$|A {{declaration}} is a pronouncement {{by a court}} {{stating the}} legal position between <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. Before 1 May 2011, {{it was not possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. Following that date, changes to Order 53 of the Rules of Court permitted an application for a declaration to be made together with an application for one or more prerogative orders. However, the application for a declaration cannot be made unless the court grants leave for the prerogative orders to be applied for.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> the negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not {{a major focus of}} Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E

5|$|Earp {{was named}} deputy sheriff {{in the area}} {{including}} newly incorporated Kootenai County, Idaho, which was disputing jurisdiction of Eagle City with Shoshone County. There were {{a considerable number of}} disagreements over mining claims and property rights, which Earp had a part in. On March 28, several feet of snow were still on the ground. Bill Buzzard, a miner of dubious reputation, began constructing a building when one of Wyatt's partners, Jack Enright, tried to stop the construction. Enright claimed the building was on part of his property. Words were exchanged and Buzzard reached for his Winchester. He fired several shots at Enright and a skirmish developed. Allies of both sides quickly took defensive positions between snowbanks and began shooting at one another. Deputy Sheriff Wyatt Earp and his brother James stepped {{into the middle of the}} fray and helped peacefully resolve the dispute before anyone was seriously hurt. Shoshone County Deputy W. E. Hunt then arrived and ordered <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> turn over their weapons.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to prerogative orders, the equitable remedy of a declaration {{can be employed}} to control an excess of legal authority. A declaration is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. In contrast to the prerogative orders which are termed public law remedies, the declaration is called a private law remedy as it was originally developed in court cases between private parties. Only the High Court may grant declarations in judicial review cases; although the Subordinate Courts are generally empowered by the Subordinate Courts Act to grant declarations, a District Court exercises no judicial review jurisdiction over acts or decisions of persons or authorities, and a Magistrate's Court cannot deal with any action {{in which there is}} no claim for any sum of money.|$|E

5|$|Statutory {{conspiracy}} {{consists of}} an agreement between two or more people to commit a criminal offence, under section 5(1) and (2) of the 1977 Act. For statutory conspiracies, there must be three elements: an agreement, to pursue a course of conduct which involves the commission of a crime, where <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> the agreement intended to commit the crime. Even if the parties later decide not {{to go through with}} the plan, since the actus reus is to reach an agreement, they can still be charged. There are certain categories of agreement which cannot amount to a criminal conspiracy, however; an agreement between a husband and wife is not a conspiracy, under section 2(2)(a) of the 1977 Act, and neither is an agreement with a person under the age of criminal responsibility, or with the intended victim of the crime.|$|E

Besides Tuđman and Izetbegović, the agreement was signed by President of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Krešimir Zubak, and the Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina Haris Silajdžić. It was mediated by Demirel. The agreement specifically stated that Croatia requested urgent military aid, especially for the Bihać area, and that <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> the agreement intended to coordinate their military activities.

5|$|Depending on the {{interest}} that the applicant seeks to represent, standing {{can be categorized}} as either private or public standing. Applicants must establish they have private standing if they seek to represent personal interests. In contrast, an applicant who seeks to represent {{the interest}}s of a larger group or {{the public at large}} must establish he or she has public or representative standing. Where private standing is concerned, the Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to obtain a declaration in an administrative law case, but where constitutional claims are concerned the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist: (1) the applicant must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated. The Court also suggested that the same test applied to applications for prerogative orders. The legal position on public standing in administrative law cases is indeterminate as, to date, no applicant has sought to rely on public standing to obtain leave for judicial review. In constitutional law cases, the Court has drawn a distinction between public and private rights, and held that people will not have standing to vindicate public rights unless they have suffered special damage and have genuine private interests to protect or further.|$|E
5|$|The ICSID {{does not}} conduct {{arbitration}} or conciliation proceedings itself, but offers institutional and procedural support to conciliation commissions, tribunals, and other committees which conduct such matters. The center has {{two sets of}} rules that determine how cases will be initiated and conducted, either under the ICSID's Convention, Regulations and Rules or the ICSID's Additional Facility Rules. To be processed {{in accordance with the}} ICSID Convention, a legal dispute has to exist between one of the center's contracting member states and a national of another contracting member state. It must also be of a legal nature and relate directly to an investment. A case can be processed under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules if one of <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> the dispute is either not a contracting member state or a national of a contracting member state. However, most cases are arbitrated under the ICSID Convention. Recourse to ICSID conciliation and arbitration is entirely voluntary. However, once the parties have consented to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, neither party can unilaterally withdraw its consent.|$|E
5|$|The players {{ultimately}} prevailed after a {{jury trial}} on their claims. That verdict, the pendency of other antitrust cases {{and the threat of}} a class action lawsuit filed by Reggie White, then with the Philadelphia Eagles, on behalf of all NFL players caused <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> settle the antitrust cases and to agree on a formula that permitted free agency. In return, the owners received a salary cap, albeit one tied to a formula based on the players' share of total league revenues. The agreement also established a salary floorminimum payrolls all teams were obliged to pay. The settlement was presented to and approved by Judge Doty, who had also heard the McNeil antitrust case in 1993. Once the agreement was approved, the NFLPA reconstituted itself as a labor union and entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the league. The NFLPA and the league extended the 1993 agreement five times. The final extension came in March 2006 when it was extended through the 2010 season after the NFL owners voted 302 to accept the NFLPA's final proposal.|$|E
