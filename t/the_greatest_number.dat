I first give a precise definition of interpersonal aggregation, which many non-utilitarians try to avoid. Then, I show that consequentialism and Scanlon can justify the case for <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> without interpersonal aggregation. However, I propose the Aggregation Approach, which justifies the case for <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> <b>number</b> in some cases and the case for tossing a fair coin in other cases. I conclude that interpersonal aggregation does not disrespect the separate person. ...|$|R
