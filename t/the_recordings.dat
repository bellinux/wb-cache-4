5|$|On 8 May 1962, Epstein {{visited the}} HMV store (owned by EMI) in 363Oxford Street, London {{to have the}} Decca tape {{transferred}} to 78rpm acetates. An HMV disc-cutter named Jim Foy liked <b>the</b> <b>recordings,</b> suggesting that Epstein should contact Sid Coleman, the head of EMI's record publishing division, which controlled the publishing company Ardmore & Beechwood. Coleman liked <b>the</b> <b>recordings</b> and sent Epstein to Martin, the A manager of Parlophone. On the next day, 9 May 1962, Epstein met Martin at EMI's Abbey Road Studios.|$|E
5|$|Soon after recording, Dolph sent an acetate disc of <b>the</b> <b>recordings</b> to Columbia in {{an attempt}} to {{interest}} them in distributing the album, but they declined, as did Atlantic Records and Elektra Records—according to Morrison, Atlantic objected to the references to drugs in Reed's songs while Elektra disliked Cale's viola. Eventually, the MGM Records-owned Verve Records accepted <b>the</b> <b>recordings</b> with the help of Verve staff producer Tom Wilson, who had recently moved from a job at Columbia.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the poor}} sound quality limits its {{commercial}} appeal, the album provides historic {{insight into the}} group's club act in the period after Ringo Starr joined but before the emergence of Beatlemania. The Beatles were unsuccessful in legally blocking the initial release of the album; <b>the</b> <b>recordings</b> were reissued in many forms until 1998, when the group were awarded full rights to the performances.|$|E
5|$|At dawn, Tanaka {{learned that}} the palace had been invaded. He went there and confronted the rebellious officers, berating them for acting {{contrary}} {{to the spirit of}} the Japanese army.

It remained on the chart for 83 weeks, until February 1, 2003, nearly two years after entering the chart.|$|E
5|$|Commentary on {{the album}} has {{included}} discussion of its minimal instrumentation and the interjection of unexpected sounds. Reviewers have described the lyrics on the songs as unconventional and dark, and noted the prominence of vocal harmonies between the Deal sisters. The reception of Title TK has been generally positive; appraisal has included commendation for Albini's contributions {{to the sound of}} the album, and for how <b>the</b> <b>recordings</b> isolate individual instruments.|$|E
5|$|Elgar's {{recordings}} {{were released}} on 78-rpm discs by both HMV and RCA Victor.

When they were reissued by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused surprise to many by their fast tempi, in contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors in the years since Elgar's death. <b>The</b> <b>recordings</b> were reissued on CD in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|In the {{original}} album credits, Harrison {{was listed as}} producer, writer and arranger but was not included among the performers, leading to an assumption {{that he did not}} play on <b>the</b> <b>recordings.</b> After consulting Barham in 2002 for his book While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Leng credited Harrison as a performing musician, and Spizer also recognised him in his track-by-track list, published in 2005. The performer credits in the 2014 reissue of Wonderwall Music rectified the situation, and list Harrison on piano and guitar.|$|E
5|$|Just Be Free is a demo album {{released}} by Warlock Records featuring music recorded by American recording artist Christina Aguilera. After finishing her run on The New Mickey Mouse Club, a then fifteen-year-old Aguilera began recording the album with New Jersey-based producers Roberts Alleca and Michael Brown. The pair gave Aguilera {{the opportunity to}} use a recording studio and presented her with demo music {{with the understanding that}} they could use the material for their own purpose, but also claiming they would not commercially release <b>the</b> <b>recordings.</b> Musically, the album consisted of dance style tracks as well as ballads, and saw Aguilera performing in Spanish language songs. The record was conceived to showcase Aguilera's vocals in an effort to reach out to record labels, a venture which actually backfired after <b>the</b> <b>recordings</b> were not very well received among critics. Six years after the completion of the album and Aguilera had achieved mainstream success, Brown and Allecca released the record and Just Be Free has sold over 128,000 copies in the United States.|$|E
