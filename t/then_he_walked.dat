And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} Oxford University in 1995, Beckinsale starred in Cold Comfort Farm as Flora Poste, a newly {{orphaned}} 1930s socialite sent {{to live with}} distant family members in rural England. The John Schlesinger-directed film was an adaptation of Stella Gibbons's novel and also featured Joanna Lumley, Eileen Atkins, Ian McKellen, Rufus Sewell and Stephen Fry. Beckinsale was initially considered too young, but was cast after she wrote a pleading letter to the director. Emanuel Levy of Variety was reminded of [...] "the strength of a young Glenda Jackson and the charm of a young Julie Christie." [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times classed the actress as [...] "yet another of those effortlessly skilled British beauties who light up the screen." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times felt she played the role [...] "with the perfect snippy aplomb." [...] The film grossed over $5 million at the US box office. Also in 1995, she appeared in Haunted, a ghost story in which Derek Elley of Variety felt she [...] "holds the screen, with both physical looks and verbal poise." [...] 1995 also saw Beckinsale's first professional stage appearance as Nina in The Seagull at Theatre Royal, Bath. She became romantically involved with co-star Michael Sheen after meeting during play rehearsals. [...] "He was the young lion of the theatre." [...] "I was all revved up to feel very intimidated. It was my first-ever play and my mother had cut out reviews of him in previous productions. And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> in ... It was almost like, 'God, well, I'm finished now. That's it, then.'... He's the most outrageously talented person I've ever met." [...] Irving Wardle of The Independent felt that [...] "the casting, including Michael Sheen's volcanic Kostya and Kate Beckinsale's steadily freezing Nina, is mainly spot-on." [...] In early 1996, she starred in two further plays; Sweetheart at the Royal Court Theatre and Clocks and Whistles at the Bush Theatre.|$|E

In 1916 she broke off their engagement, or perhaps Broun did: {{according}} to Fred Lieb, another sportswriter and a friend of Broun's at the time, Broun [...] "caught the enchanting Lydia Lapopka in the lap, so to speak, of her Russian director.... walked east on one street, knocking over every garbage and trash can he passed. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> west on the street giving it the same treatment. Just as he was getting really warmed up to the sport he ran {{into the hands of the}} law. Heywood spent the night in the hoosegow before friends bailed him out the next morning." ...|$|E
