5|$|C Company {{lands on}} Guadalcanal unopposed and marches to the {{interior}} of the island, encountering natives and evidence of the Japanese presence. They arrive near Hill 210, a key Japanese position. The Japanese have placed bunkers at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> and anyone attempting the climb will be cut down.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{have shown}} {{evidence}} of a 12th-century masonry building on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> which may be from the probable adulterine castle. The side of the mound may have been terraced for agricultural use due {{to much of the}} surrounding land flooded on a regular basis during the medieval period.|$|E
5|$|After {{about two}} hours, Marines reached and climbed Hill 148. Working from the top, the Marines began {{clearing}} the Japanese fighting {{positions on the}} hill, most of which still remained, with explosive charges, grenades, and hand-to-hand combat. From <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> the Marines were also able to put increased suppressive fire on Tanambogo. The Marine battalion commander on Gavutu radioed General Rupertus with a request for reinforcements before attempting to assault Tanambogo.|$|E

5|$|On June 2, C Company {{moved to}} capture Hill 543 {{near the village}} of Chipo-ri. The hill was {{protected}} by heavily entrenched Chinese infantry as well as mortars at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> During their first attempt to advance up the hill, the company took heavy casualties, and the 3rd Platoon leader was mortally wounded. Charlton took command of the platoon and reorganized it for another attack. Heavy fire eventually forced the company back down the hill.|$|E
5|$|A cube-shaped {{concrete}} {{building was}} constructed on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> {{next to the}} dome. This {{was intended to be}} used as the bomb-proof outlet for a ventilation and air conditioning shaft. It was an essential component of a facility where dangerous and explosive gases were expected to be used in large quantities on a daily basis. It was never finished, and the Allies found when they captured the site that the ventilation shaft had not been fully excavated. The building survived the bombing intact and is still prominently visible today.|$|E

5|$|After one {{intersection}} with 5900 South, which presently serves {{only the}} toll road company's headquarters {{and a single}} commercial building, private maintenance gives way to a four-lane city street with sidewalks just shy of 5800 South. The roadway continues northeasterly to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> near 5600 South, where pre-existing Adams Avenue (500 East) heads north, passing the Ogden Regional Medical Center to an intersection with Washington Boulevard (US-89) on the Washington Terrace-South Ogden border. Adams Avenue continues through South Ogden and into Ogden as a minor street one block east of US-89, with a gap near 4600 South and more north of downtown Ogden. In 2006 approximately 1,400cars traveled the parkway on an average weekday.|$|E
5|$|Hartshead Pike is a stone tower {{on top of}} Hartshead Hill {{overlooking}} Ashton and Oldham. The current {{building was}} constructed in 1863 {{although there has been}} a building on the site since at least the mid-18th century, although the original purpose is obscure. The pike may have been the site of a beacon in the late 16th century. It has a visitor centre and from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> it is possible to see the Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire, the Welsh hills, and the Holme Moss transmitter in West Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|NY424 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY380 {{in the town}} of Stockton. The route headed northeast, passing by forests and homes as it ascended Stockton Hill. Here, it intersected with Nelson Hill Road, a short alternate route of NY424. After reaching <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> NY424 became known as Stockton Hill Road and went through fields {{on its way to the}} village of Cassadaga. Once in the village limits, the highway intersected Putnam Road (CR71) in an area of Cassadaga known as Burnhams. NY424 continued on into the heart of the village, passing by homes and the southern end of Lower Lake before coming to an end at an intersection with NY60.|$|E

5|$|Several {{residential}} squares with terraces of three-storey {{houses were}} laid out around central gardens. An example is Portland Square, which was built between 1789 and 1820, and is now largely occupied by offices. In the 1830s, much of Queen Square was rebuilt following damage caused during the Bristol Riots, and {{to the north of}} the city, Kings Square. The most fashionable areas were at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> as in wet weather the cesspits overflowed down the hill. Further development, though in a less formal manner, continued along the radial roads to Stokes Croft and Cheltenham, towards Horfield and in the St Phillips, Redcliffe and Bedminster areas.|$|E
5|$|The Church of Ireland {{community}} had worshipped {{at the old}} church, which was in a ruinous state by 1829 when the new St. Paul's Church was built at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> overlooking the town. The new Catholic church of St. Rynagh's had been constructed some three years earlier and on land given by the Armstrongs, the most influential and wealthiest Protestant family in the area, who consistently and energetically advocated Catholic Emancipation and repeal of the Penal Laws. This situation demonstrated the friendly relations that existed between the two communities in Banagher during those difficult times for Catholics in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|At 4:00pm, {{following}} {{a period of}} artillery preparation, the commandos launched their attack. Amidst thick mist and heavy rain, the attack went badly from the start. Shortly after stepping off, No. 5 Troop was ambushed by a German force disguised as locals, reducing its strength to just five men. The main assault force pressed on, although by now it consisted of only 67 men due to earlier losses. Part of the assault force—No. 6 Troop—took heavy fire and lost forward momentum; however, the other two troops gained <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> and broke in to the German position. Upon reaching the summit they were greeted by an intense volume of heavy machine gun fire {{and at this point}} {{it became clear that the}} preparatory bombardment had not been successful. Calls for further artillery support were denied due to a shortage of ammunition amongst the field batteries and eventually after a number of unsuccessful attempts at taking the position the commandos were forced to retire.|$|E

5000|$|Squats can be {{performed}} to varying depths.

Confusingly, many other definitions for [...] "parallel" [...] depth abound, none <b>of</b> which represents <b>the</b> standard in organized powerlifting. From shallowest to deepest, these other standards are: bottom of hamstring parallel to the ground; the hip joint itself below <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee, or femur parallel to <b>the</b> floor; and <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper thigh (i.e., <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quadriceps) below <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee.|$|R
5|$|Completion of {{the station}} {{buildings}} was delayed for many years. Designed by the architect Charles Holden, the pre-war plans included a large entrance building at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> next to The Woodman public house {{with a pair of}} escalators between the entrance and the sub-surface concourse. These were to be enclosed in an inclined structure {{down the side of the}} cutting parallel with the surface tracks. Taking inspiration from the local legend, the building would have been topped by a statue of Dick Whittington and his cat. When works were finished in 1957, a single, upwards only, escalator was provided to take passengers from the sub-surface ticket hall up to a simple exit at the top of the cutting.|$|E
5|$|Fifty light {{infantry}} {{men were}} in pursuit of Mercer's men when a fresh brigade of 1,100 militiamen {{under the command of}} Cadwalader appeared. Mawhood gathered his men who were all over the battlefield and put them into battle line formation. Meanwhile, Sullivan was at a standoff with the detachment of the 55th Regiment that had come to assist the 40th Regiment, neither daring to move towards the main battle for risk of exposing its flank. Cadwalader attempted to move his men into a battle line but they had no combat experience and did not know even the most basic military maneuvers. When his men reached <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> and saw Mercer's men fleeing from the British, most of the militia turned around and ran back down the hill.|$|E
5|$|The {{flanking}} party {{consisted of}} Knowlton's Rangers, {{which had been}} reinforced by three companies of riflemen, in total about 200 men. As they approached, an officer accidentally misdirected the men, and the firing broke out on the British flank, not their rear. The British troops, realizing that they had almost been surrounded, retreated to a field, {{where there was a}} fence. The Americans soon pursued and, during the attack, Knowlton was killed. Despite this, the American troops pushed on; driving the British troops beyond the fence {{to the top of a}} hill. When they reached the hill, the British forces received reinforcements; including some artillery. For two hours, the British troops held their ground at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> until the Americans once again forced them to retreat, into a buckwheat field where Barnard College now stands.|$|E

5|$|With the {{collapse}} of Magaw's outer lines {{to the south and}} east of the fort, the general American retreat towards the perceived safety of the fort took place. To the south, the third defensive line had never been completed so Cadwalader had nowhere left to retreat to except the fort. To the north, the riflemen under Rawlings still held, but barely, as there were fewer riflemen than before and because the increased amount of firing had jammed some of the men's weapons, some of the men were forced to push boulders down the hill at the attacking Hessians. The American battery at Fort Washington was silenced by Pearl. By this time, the riflemen's fire had almost ceased, and the Hessians slowly advanced up the hill and engaged the Americans in hand-to-hand fighting. Overpowering the Americans, the Hessians reached <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> and swarmed into the redoubt with a bayonet charge, capturing it quickly.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} in the campaign, the Austrian command staff was in full confusion. Ferdinand began to openly oppose Mack's command style and decisions, {{charging}} that the latter spent his days writing contradictory orders that left the Austrian army marching back and forth. On 13 October Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north: one under Johann Sigismund Riesch headed towards Elchingen to secure the bridge there and the other under Franz von Werneck went north with most of the heavy artillery. Ney hurried his corps forward to reestablish contact with Dupont, who was still north of the Danube. Ney led Loison's division to the south of Elchingen on the right bank of the Danube to begin the attack. Malher's division crossed the river farther east and moved west toward Riesch's position. The field was a partially wooded flood plain, rising steeply to the hill town of Elchingen, which had a wide field of view. The French cleared the Austrian pickets from a bridge, then a regiment boldly attacked and captured the abbey at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> at bayonet point. During the Battle of Elchingen, the Austrian cavalry was also defeated and Reisch's infantry fled toward Ulm. Ney was given the title Duke of Elchingen for his impressive victory.|$|E
5|$|Klenau's {{victory was}} the {{singular}} success. On 14 October Mack sent two columns out of Ulm {{in preparation for}} a breakout to the north: one under Johann Sigismund Riesch headed toward Elchingen to secure the bridge there, and the other under Franz von Werneck went north with most of the heavy artillery. Recognizing the opportunity, Marshal Michel Ney hurried the rest of his VI Corps forward to re-establish contact with Dupont, who was still north of the Danube. In a two-pronged attack Ney sent one division to the south of Elchingen on the right bank of the Danube. This division began the assault at Elchingen. At the same time another division crossed the river to the east and moved west against Riesch's position. After clearing Austrian pickets from a bridge, the French attacked and captured a strategically located abbey at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> at bayonet point. The Austrian cavalry unsuccessfully tried to fend off the French, but the Austrian infantry broke and ran. In this engagement alone, the Austrians lost more than half their reserve artillery park, 6,000 (out of 8,000 total participants) dead, wounded or captured and four colors. Reisch's column also failed to destroy the bridges across the Danube.|$|E
