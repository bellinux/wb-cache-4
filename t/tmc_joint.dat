40|$|Purpose To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} {{that there is no}} difference in trapeziometacarpal (<b>TMC)</b> <b>joint</b> arthrosis-related symptoms and disability between patients seeking treatment for symptoms of TMC arthrosis and those with incidental <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> arthrosis. Methods We compared 64 patients presenting for care of <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> arthrosis with 64 with incidental <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> arthrosis. For both groups, the diagnosis was based on crepitation on examination. Bivariate and multivariate analyses assessed factors associated with symptoms and disability related to <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> arthrosis. Results In bivariate analysis, patients presenting for care of <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> arthrosis had significantly more symptoms and disability from <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> arthrosis than those with incidental <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> arthrosis. The best multivariate linear regression model for fewer <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> arthrosis-related symptoms and disability included patients with incidental <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> arthrosis, male sex, no other painful conditions, less catastrophic thinking, and fewer depressive symptoms and explained 74 % of the variability. Having incidental <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> arthrosis (25 %) and more adaptive coping strategies (less catastrophic thinking; 5 %) were the most important contributors to fewer symptoms and less disability. Conclusions Future studies are merited to determine whether training in better coping strategies (eg, less catastrophic thinking and fewer depressive symptoms) can decrease symptoms and disability in patients with <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> arthrosis.

40|$|The basal thumb joint or trapeziometacarpal (<b>TMC)</b> <b>joint</b> {{is crucial}} for the high {{mobility}} of the thumb. Its particular configuration {{has been described as}} a saddle joint with two principal axes of motion allowing extension-flexion and abduction-adduction. In addition, the thumb can rotate around its long axis, a movement also referred to as pronation-supination. During opposition of the thumb, which is typically used to score thumb mobility and functionality (i. e. Kapandji score), flexion, adduction and pronation are combined. With its unique configuration diplaying high intrinsic mobility and limited intrinsic stability, osteoarthritis (OA) of the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> is highly prevalent, making this joint the most common hand site for surgical joint reconstruction. Painful TMC OA is a highly disabling, age-related joint disorder with a large socioeconomic impact which is only expected to increase with the aging of the population. This major public health problem strengthens the need for further research in the field. The state of knowledge shows a lack of consistency, robustness and evidence for the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> ligaments anatomy and function. Available anatomical studies do not agree on the identification, nomenclature and stabilizing role of the ligaments. Early publications pointed the anterior oblique ligament (AOL) as the key stabilizing structure, while the dorsoradial ligament (DRL) has been put forward as the main <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> stabilizer in some more recent studies. This may have an important impact on the functional outcome of the available surgical procedures that were developed on early AOL-based concepts. Another major point in thumb function is that an accurate quantification of the kinematics of the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint,</b> but also of the more proximal joint, namely the scaphotrapezial (ST) joint, remains lacking. This is largely due to the fact that the existing body of literature on healthy and OA conditions only describe the first metacarpal (MC 1) kinematics with either a fixed trapezium or trapezium-based coordinate system. Despite the high value of these studies in elucidating the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> kinematics, the motion of the trapezium as well as of the scaphoid remain excluded from the analyses. Furthermore, many in vitro studies have been performed in the past years to understand the contact biomechanics of the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint,</b> with a strong inconsistency when comparing their respective results. One of the main limitations of these studies is the use of highly invasive techniques, only applicable on cadaver specimens. To date, experimental studies have not yet been able to define the behaviour of the MC 1 and trapezium articular surfaces during in vivo thumb motions, and the evolution of the contact biomechanics from a healthy to a diseased <b>TMC</b> <b>joint.</b> Another surprising fact is that, since over 40 years, <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> arthroplasty for OA has been performed using ball-and-socket implants inspired from hip implant concepts to replace a saddle-shaped joint, without any kinematical studies on the effect total joint replacement on the three-dimensional (3 D) motion capability of the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint.</b> This state of knowledge raises many questions. Where is the truth on <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> stabilizing ligaments? What about ligament reconstructive surgeries based on an earlier contested concept? What are we, as surgeons, supposed to do with these ligaments? Which ligaments to reconstruct? How do bones and joints move during thumb motions in daily activities? What is the pressure distribution inside the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint?</b> Is a ball-and-socket implant able to restore the native thumb mobility? Why do ball-and-socket implants work successfully and why do they fail? To address all these questions, we designed several studies, starting with the basics, i. e. ligament anatomy, then focusing on in vivo kinematics and contact biomechanics of the MC 1, trapezium and scaphoid. Understanding the thumb joints anatomy and function is of primordial importance in optimizing surgical procedures and treatment strategies, as well as our knowledge on OA pathogenesis. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{quantify}} {{the effect of}} osteoarthritis (OA) and total trapeziometacarpal (<b>TMC)</b> <b>joint</b> replacement on thumb kinematics during the primary physiological motions of the thumb. Methods We included 4 female patientswith stage III TMC OA. A computed tomography based markerless method was used to {{quantify the}} 3 -dimensional thumb kinematics in patients before and after <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> replacement surgery with the Arpe implant. Results Trapeziometacarpal OA led to a marked decrease of internal rotation and abduction of the first metacarpal (MC 1) during thumb flexion and a decrease of MC 1 adduction during thumb adduction. As a compensatory phenomenon, the trapezium displayed increased abduction. The absence of MC 1 translation in the ball-and-socket implant seems to induce a decrease of MC 1 adduction {{as well as a}} decrease of trapezium adduction during thumb adduction, compared with OA and healthy joints. Implant replacement displayed an unchanged MC 1 flexion during thumb flexion and seemed to slightly increase MC 1 axial rotation during thumb flexion and adduction. Abduction and adduction of the MC 1 are limited and compensated by this somewhat increased axial rotation, allowing more efficient thumb opposition. Conclusions The study highlights that advanced TMC OA mainly restricts the MC 1 mobility. We also showed that, whereas total joint arthroplasty is able to restore thumb function, it cannot fully replicate the kinematics of the healthy <b>TMC</b> <b>joint.</b> Clinical relevance The quantification of <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> kinematics in OA and implanted patients is essential to improve our understanding of TMC OA as well as to enhance the functionality of implant designs. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The trapeziometacarpal (<b>TMC)</b> <b>joint</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} joints in the human body. It provides the thumb with the ability to cross over the palm of the hand, thus enabling motions of pinch and grip essential in performing routine daily activities. In the case of repeated use of this joint, the articular cartilage may wear through a progressive joint disease known as osteoarthritis (OA). This disease is characterized by pain at the base of the thumb, decreased range of motion, thumb instability, and decreased grip and pinch strength leading to impairment in vocational activities, significantly affecting quality of life. Much of the research surrounding the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> has focused on development of non-surgical and surgical options for treatment of early and late stage OA. Unfortunately, the extent of research on characterizing the biophysical properties of the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> and surrounding tissue is limited. The following research will seek to identify the ligamentous structures hypothesized to act as primary stabilizers of the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> through advanced, high-resolution motion analyses. Mechanical properties of the primary ligamentous stabilizers will be obtained through uniaxial tensile testing of ligamentous tissue. This tissue will be further characterized through histology, staining for identification of the presence and orientation of essential proteins which may serve to support the argument for primary stabilizing tissue. Using results from the tissue characterization studies, two techniques are presented for the treatment of early and late stage <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> osteoarthris, which are designed to maintain and/or regain stability of this joint.

40|$|Purpose The {{respective}} {{roles of}} the dorsoradial (DRL) and anterior oblique (AOL) ligaments in stability of the highly mobile trapeziometacarpal (<b>TMC)</b> <b>joint</b> remain disputed. Earlier publications have pointed to the AOL as the key stabilizing structure; yet, more recent publications have challenged the stabilizing role of the AOL, favoring the DRL as the main <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> stabilizer. We executed an anatomical study of the ligaments, including detailed dissection to quantify the length, width, and thickness of the AOL and DRL and tested the material properties of these ligaments. Methods Thirteen fresh frozen cadaveric thumbs from 9 specimens were used. Length, width, and thickness of the AOL and DRL were measured on magnetic resonance imaging and/or after dissection. Next, the first metacarpal and trapezium were isolated together with both ligaments, and both bones were cut sagittally to isolate a first metacarpal-AOL-trapezium and first metacarpal-DRL-trapezium complex from each thumb. These samples were subjected to cyclic loading in displacement-controlled tests. The obtained force-displacement curves were used to calculate stiffness and hysteresis of each sample. Results Our {{results showed that the}} DRL is significantly shorter and thicker than the AOL, which is thin and ill-defined. Our results also indicate that the DRL has a higher stiffness than the AOL, making it a more likely candidate to provide joint stability. Conclusions Although the AOL has been asserted to be the primary restraint to dorsoradial subluxation, this view has been challenged over the past 10 years by several studies. These studies have shown the AOL to be relatively weak and compliant compared with the intermetacarpal and dorsoradial ligaments and have demonstrated that the DRL is the strongest and stiffest ligament of the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint.</b> Our studies confirm these findings. Clinical relevance This study indicates that the DRL is relatively stiff and thick, suggesting it should be repaired or reconstructed when disrupted to restore stability of the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint.</b> © 2014 ASSH Published by Elsevier, Inc.

Intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid may potentially meet the need for effective, minimally invasive intervention in patients not responding adequately to initial treatment. We aimed to confirm the safety and effectiveness of viscosupplementation with Durolane (NASHA nonanimal hyaluronic acid) in rhizarthrosis. Patients and methods: This was a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, open-label study with a 6 -month follow-up period. Eligible patients had Eaton–Littler grade II–III rhizarthrosis in one <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> with pain and visual analog scale (VAS) pain score ≥ 4 (scale: 0 – 10). A single injection of NASHA was administered to the affected <b>TMC</b> <b>joint.</b> The primary effectiveness variable was change from baseline in VAS pain score. Results: Thirty-five patients (mean age 60. 8 years; 85. 7 % female) received NASHA and completed the study. The least-squares mean change from baseline in VAS pain score over 6  months was – 2. 00, a reduction of 27. 8 % (p< 0. 001). The reduction in pain exceeded 25 % as early as month 1 (26. 5 %), and gradual improvement was observed throughout the 6 -month follow-up period. Secondary effectiveness parameters included QuickDASH (shortened version of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand [DASH]), Kapandji thumb opposition test, radial abduction, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint flexion, and pinch (clamp) strength. Most of these measurements showed statistically significant improvements from baseline over 6 months. Five adverse events (injection site reactions) were reported in four patients (11. 4 %), and there were no serious or allergic reactions. Conclusion: This study suggests that viscosupplementation using NASHA is effective and well tolerated in treating the symptoms of rhizarthrosis.

PRP was produced using the Double Syringe System (Arthrex Inc., Naples, Florida, USA). A total volume of 1. 47 ± 0. 25 [*]mL PRP was injected at the first injection and 1. 5 ± 0. 41 [*]mL at the second injection, depending on the volume capacity of the joint. Patients were evaluated using VAS, strength measures, and the Mayo Wrist score and DASH score after 3 and 6 months. VAS significantly decreased from 6. 2 ± 1. 6 to 5. 4 ± 2. 2 at six-month follow-up (P< 0. 05). The DASH score was unaffected; however, the Mayo Wrist score significantly improved from 46. 5 ± 18. 6 to 67. 5 ± 19. 0 at six-month follow-up (P= 0. 05).

40|$|Richards, James G. Thumb {{function}} {{accounts for}} up to 50 percent of total hand function with most of its function coming from the trapeziometacarpal (<b>TMC)</b> <b>joint,</b> located {{at the base of}} the thumb between the first metacarpal and trapezium. The <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> is unique in that it has two non-intersecting, non-orthogonal axes of rotation that generate three distinct motions; flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and pronation/supination. Past studies have analyzed overall ROM of the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> by simultaneously measuring maximal planar and composite motions, which together form a spherical surface area used to find the maximal workspace. However, none of these studies have compared their results with range of motion (ROM) or workspace measurements obtained during clinical tests such as the thumb opposition portion of the Modified Kapandji Index (MKI), which is designed to measure the thumb component of overall hand mobility. Analysis of TMC kinematics is also important in identifying potential risk factors of TMC osteoarthritis (OA), one of the most common diseases of the hand. TMC OA is believed to be caused by increased joint ROM, and has been shown to be more prevalent in the female population. However, past studies analyzing TMC kinematics between genders have shown mixed results, so it becomes imperative to determine if females display significantly greater TMC ROM and workspace than males. The purpose of this study was to determine the difference in ROM and workspace measurements at the trapeziometacarpal joint between genders using multiple measurement techniques. An eight camera motion capture system was used to track the location of retroreflective markers placed on the wrist, hand, and thumb. Based on these marker locations, coordinate systems for the wrist, hand, and thumb were built. TMC axis orientation and TMC workspace were then calculated using custom software written in LabVIEW and Matlab. Comparisons between the MKI task and Max TMC task showed that the MKI task displays significantly less abduction/adduction ROM (p=. 038) and workspace (p=. 045) than the Max TMC task. Comparisons between genders for each of the measured motions showed no significant differences in TMC ROM in either of the TMC axes. Comparisons between genders during each of the multi-movement tasks (MKI and Max TMC) showed no significant differences in TMC workspace. These results indicate that increased mobility is not a viable explanation for the increased likelihood of developing TMC OA in the female population, which raises further research questions aimed at determining the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> differences between genders which may explain the discrepancy in TMC OA development. These results also prove that the clinical MKI test is ineffective in measuring the entire ROM and workspace of the thumb. This means that it may need to be done in unison with other tests to ensure that the patient is exploring a greater amount of their available TMC abduction/adduction ROM and workspace. This information is important to both clinicians and patients as it may help to improve on the process of clinically measuring and evaluating thumb ROM and function in injured and pathological populations. While this research has proven beneficial in determining kinematic differences between healthy populations, future research should focus on the development of an accurate musculoskeletal model of the human thumb with the ability of assessing both kinematic and kinetic parameters. This would prove to be a valuable tool that could be used to track the onset and progression of thumb related pathologies as well as make comparisons between different subject populations, such as individuals with healthy TMC joints and individuals with osteoarthritic TMC joints. This future thumb model would also be a monumental tool which could be used by surgeons and clinicians to optimize pre-surgical planning and assess different treatment outcomes at an individual patient level.

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{very common}} {{degenerative}} joint disease that affects {{the integrity of the}} articular cartilage and which most important symptoms are pain and loss of mobility. This chronic disorder affects primarily the middle-aged and elderly population with a fast increasing prevalence with aging. Mechanical factors {{play an important role in}} the development of OA, but how joint loading, intra-articular contact patterns and joint morphology are interrelated and linked to the onset of OA has not been determined. The main objective of our project is to introduce new computational and experimental platforms to improve our understanding of OA occurrence mechanisms in the specific context of the human trapeziometacarpal (<b>TMC)</b> <b>joint.</b> The <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> is located at the base of the thumb and composed of the first metacarpal and trapezium. It has a concavo-convex structure allowing high thumb mobility and providing the human hand with unique prehension abilities. However, this joint is also prone to degenerative changes, with TMC OA occurring in more than one third of women/men above 60. The platforms developed in this project are based on biomechanical concepts that define the independent behavior of anatomical structures (e. g. cartilage and ligaments). The specificity of the developed platforms is that they combine these independent concepts in generic computational models and are associated with the most advanced mechanical testing and medical imaging technologies. The objectives are (1) to provide modeling tools to further understand the contact biomechanics, load-driven kinematics and dynamics of the healthy and arthritic human thumb during physiological motion and tasks of daily living; (2) to evaluate the impact of degenerative changes on the biomechanical behavior of the TMC joint; (3) to assess the role and biomechanical behavior of anatomical structures of the human thumb. Such insights will improve our understanding of articular structures and joint function, and will help us to assess their role in the pathomechanics of OA. This knowledge will contribute to better prevention and rehabilitation strategies for this highly disabling condition of the thumb. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. This study aims to, using {{diagnostic}} musculoskeletal ultrasound, {{investigate the}} presence of intra-articular gas bubbles in the trapeziometacarpal (<b>TMC)</b> <b>joint</b> cavity {{in the absence of}} an axial distractive load, after a high velocity low amplitude (HVLA) Chiropractic adjustment and assess the state of the gas bubble after a 20 minute refractory period. Using plain film radiography, several authors, (Roston and Wheeler Haines, 1947, Semlak and Ferguson, 1970, Unsworth, Dowson and Wright, 1971 and Watson, Kernohan and Mollan, 1989) have consistently demonstrated {{the presence of}} an intra-articular radiolucent space in an MCP joint after cavitation. The MCP joint was always manipulated with an axial distractive load. The singular radiolucent cavity was shown to be visible only if an axial distractive force was acting across the joint at the time of the post-manipulation radiograph. Cramer, Tuck, Todd Knudsen, Fonda, Schliesser, Fournier and Patel, (2000), have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate a significant increase in the lumbar zygapophyseal joint spaces (0, 7 mm) after an adjustment versus the control group (0, 0 mm increase). The observed increase in joint space was the primary aim of their research and no reference is made to the presence of an intra-articular gas bubble or any apparent changes in joint space density on post-adjustment MRI scans. They attribute this increase in joint space to breaking of intra-articular adhesions. Using computed tomography (CT) and Radiography, Cascioli, Corr and Till, (2002), reported that no gas bubbles were visualised in the cervical facet joints after an adjustment, with and without traction. This study consisted of 18 participants between the ages of 21 and 26. A pertinent physical examination and a regional examination of the forearm hand and wrist were conducted to ensure no significant pathologies would exclude them from the study. The TMC articular cavity was scanned by an experienced musculoskeletal ultrasonographer at three intervals: pre-adjustment, directly post-adjustment, and at 20 minutes post- adjustment. The ultrasonograms were saved as digital copies for subsequent reports which were correlated with reports compiled during dynamic visualisation of the articular cavity at the time of scanning.

40|$|The modern human thumb {{can be seen}} as a {{hallmark}} of human evolution. The unique anatomy of the human thumb makes it possible to carefully manipulate tools, powerfully grasp objects and even throw items with precision. These apparent contradictory functions of the thumb, high mobility for manual dexterity vs. high stability during forceful grasping, imply that daily activities impose a high strain on a relative instable joint. This makes the thumb susceptible to joint disorders such as osteoarthritis. Both systemic (e. g. genetics, hormones, obesity) and mechanical factors (e. g. joint loading) are important in the development of osteoarthritis, but the precise pathomechanism remains largely unknown. In this project, we focus on the mechanical factors in the disease process and use a multidisciplinary approach to develop, refine and apply a toolset that helps to further investigate the link between structure and (dys) function of the human thumb. First of all, we developed and validated a dynamic CT protocol that allows accurate quantification of 3 D bone motion using a limited radiation dose. This validated dynamic CT technique was then used to analyze thumb motion in patients with an unstable and painful trapeziometacarpal (<b>TMC)</b> <b>joint.</b> We compared the thumb base kinematics from patients before and after a dorsal ligament shortening operation. These kinematics were compared with age-and-sex-matched healthy controls. In addition, changes in contact patterns between the articular facets during the motion cycle were mapped to assess the impact of the surgery on joint mechanics. As mechanical loading of the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> is largely generated by contraction of thumb muscles, we also investigated thumb muscle activations during functional tasks using fine-wire electromyography. We found subject-specific muscle recruitment patterns which remained largely unchanged between tasks. Finally we expand on the anatomy in general. By using 7 T MRI, CT and detailed dissection, a 3 D digital model of the forearm and hand of a single, un-embalmed, specimen was created with full quantification of the muscle architecture, bone and cartilage geometry. This multifaceted approach has led to profound insights in the relation between form and function of the human thumb, as well as in the involvement of distinct anatomical and mechanical factors in the onset and development of osteoarthritis of the thumb joint. status: accepte...|$|E

Which ligaments are responsible for governing {{the stability of the}} TMC is still a source of controversy; the very naming of some of the ligaments is also in dispute. The overall aim of the experiments in this thesis is to explore the stabilization of the TMC ligaments during a specific positions (the neutral and full abduction positions), the mechanics of the attachment, the relaxing and stretching of the TMC ligaments, and the responsibilities of the TMC ligaments to prevent the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> subluxations such as dorsal subluxation, palmar subluxation, and lateral subluxation. An additional aim is to describe the orientation of the TMC ligaments (origin, insertion) and the ligament fibres’ directions. The study used development devices to render the TMC ligaments into 2 D reconstruction and 3 D modelling in the 3 D virtual environment such as Rhinoceros V 5, 3 D Landmark software, and 3 D Amira software. Length, width, area, volume, thickness, and cross-sectional measurements were assessed in the neutral and full abduction positions. The ligament stretcher was designed to stretch the TMC ligaments after the ligaments were cut away from the joint. Also used in the thesis is a new technique to develop staining procedures by combining two different stains with accurate timing and re-timing the procedures of the Miller’s Elastin Staining protocol. Also, the entheses investigations have been applied on the attachments of the TMC ligaments with trapezuim and first metacarpal bones (proximal and distal). Moreover, the technique of the high resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM) was used to identify the relation of the TMC ligaments fibres to the flexor retinaculum, especially at dorso-ulnar trapeziometacarpal ligament (DUTML). The layers of the palmar trapeziometacarpal ligament (PTML) were also investigated to identify the nature of this ligament. The osteological descriptions were noted for the first metacarpal and trapezium bones, the geometrical measurement experiments on the articular surface of both bones allowed for a description {{of the effects of the}} degenerative disease, especially osteioarthritis disease (OA), and comparisons between both genders, the right and left specimens, embalmed and fresh cadavers were investigated to achieve the most accurate and precise results. The index procedures against the third metacarpal assisted in describing the relation between the actual reading and index reading. Seven ligaments were shown in the 3 D virtual environment: radial trapeziometacarpal ligament (RTML), superficial palmar trapeziometacarpal ligament (sPTML), deep palmar trapeziometacarpal ligament (dPTML), palmo-ulnar trapeziometacarpal ligament (PUTML), dorso-ulnar trapeziometacarpal ligament (DUTML), palmar intermetacarpal ligament (PIML), and dorsal intermetacarpal ligament (DIML). Also, the results revealed that the PIML and DIML were the main stabilizers through the experiments, and the DUTML and PUTML served as associated ligaments to prevent <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> dislocation. The RTML prevented radial subluxation, while the superficial and deep layers of the PTML acted as a pivot for the movement of the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint</b> and assisted in preventing a palmar subluxation. In addition, there were no significant differences (p> 0. 05) between embalmed and fresh cadavers, but there were significant differences (p< 0. 05) between male and female cadavers as well as between the right and left hands, especially in the measurement investigations. Moreover, the TMC ligament attachments were found to be of the fibrocartilagenous type; this was found at both attachments, proximal and distal. The combination beginning with Miller Elastin stain (ME) was better than that starting with Modified Masson Trichrome stain (MME) and the colours were nearer to those of the MMT results; however, the MMT alone was clearest. Also, a re-timing of the ME stain revealed that the experiment involving 2. 5 hours of Miller’s Elastin and 15 seconds of Van Gieson Solution was the best of all experiments. The HREM technique revealed no connection between the collagen fibres of both the DUTML and the flexor retinaculum. The single coordination points of each of the first metacarpal (1 st MC) and trapezium (TM) bones revealed varieties of prominences and declines in the bones’ surfaces, especially the articular surface. New names of the TMC ligaments as following: Old Name	New Name Ulnar collateral ligament (UCL). 	Radial trapeziometacarpal ligament (RTML). Superficial anterior oblique ligament (sAOL). 	Superficial palmar trapeziometacarpal ligament (sPTML). Deep anterior oblique ligament (dAOL). 	Deep palmar trapeziometacarpal ligament (dPTML). Posterior oblique ligament (POL). 	Palmo-ulnar trapeziometacarpal ligament (PUTML). Dorso-radial ligament (DRL). 	Dorso-ulnar trapeziometacarpal ligament (DUTML). New osteological definitions were noted, such as the distal border of the 1 st MC facet, the distal and proximal ridge of the palmar surface of the 1 st MC, and eminences of the trapezial ridge of TM. Overall, the results of my studies suggested that the importance of the PIML, DIML, and RTML should be considered when planning surgeries involving ligament reconstruction of the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint...</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The trapeziometacarpal (<b>TMC)</b> <b>joint</b> of {{the human}} thumb {{is the second most}} common joint in the hand {{affected}} by osteoarthritis. TMC arthroplasty is a common procedure used to alleviate symptoms. No randomized controlled trials have been published on the efficacy of different post-operative orthotic regimes. Method: Fifty six participants who underwent TMC arthroplasty were allocated to either rigid orthotic or semi-rigid orthotic groups. Both groups started an identical exercise program at two weeks following surgery. Outcome measures were assessed by an assessor blinded to group allocation. The primary outcome was the Patient Rated Wrist and Hand Evaluation (PRWHE) and secondary outcomes included the Michigan Hand Questionnaire (MHQ), thumb palmar abduction, first metacarpophalangeal extension and three point pinch grip. Measures were taken pre-operatively, at six weeks, three months and one year post-operatively. Between-group differences were analyzed with linear regression. Results: Both groups performed equally well. There was no significant between-group difference for PRWHE scores (0. 47, CI − 11. 5 to 12. 4), including subscales for pain and function, or for any of the secondary outcomes at one year follow-up. Conclusion: We found no difference in outcomes between using a rigid or semi-rigid orthosis after TMC arthroplasty. Patient comfort, cost and availability may determine choice between orthoses in clinical practice. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhile {{modeling}} the trapeziometacarpal (<b>TMC)</b> <b>joint</b> for determination of tendon forces, the TMC {{has been considered}} frictionless and passive moments created by soft tissues neglected. This, however, becomes inaccurate when reaching the joint end range of motion and considering that the TMC is entirely crossed by a complex network of skin, ligaments, soft tissues, and tendons. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the passive moments with respect to joint posture in order to further include this relationship in biomechanical modeling. An experimental method was proposed to estimate in vivo a global passive moment including the sum of the actions of each passive anatomical structure. An external force was applied at the level of the metacarpophalangeal joint in various directions ranging from neutral position to full extension and full adduction to full abduction. The passive moment was computed and expressed as a function of the adopted joint angles. An exponential regression was then developed to fit the experimental data and to propose a generic passive moment model. Results showed a good agreement between the proposed exponential regression model and the experimental measures. Moreover, it was shown that joint stiffness could represent more than 60 % of the net joint moment during a typical pulp grip task. These results showed the necessity to include the data in biomechanical modeling. The results may help predict more realistic tendons force especially in abduction/adduction muscles.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{examines the}} reliability and reproducibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology in evaluating the anterior oblique ligament (AOL) of the trapeziometacarpal joint (TMC) of the thumb, {{in order to establish}} an effective imaging protocol to use in the early identification of conditions leading to degenerative arthritis. We used cadaver specimens, three hand surgeons independently rated from X-rays each specimen. The specimens were then scanned in a General Electric MRI machine with a standard wrist coil. An effort was made to reproduce the image of the AOL - with a unique technique to obtain images of the obliquely oriented thumb and its ligaments. Following the MRI, the specimens were dissected to expose the AOL and visualize the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint.</b> A standard MRI fiducial was sewn to the proximal and distal extent of the volar side of the AOL. The soft tissues were replaced and the skin was closed. They were then rescanned following the same protocol, and pre and post-dissection ligamentlabeled specimens were compared. Following dissection and tagging of the AOL ligament, a repeat MRI confirmed its location and validated the protocol in all cases. The open dissection and ligament tagging confirmed that what was visualized was in fact the structure of interest. This investigation demonstrated that with an appropriate MRI protocol it is feasible to guide the scanner to catch appropriate images of a ligament that is closely correlated with degenerative arthritis...|$|E
40|$|The thumb plays {{a crucial}} role in basic hand function. However, the {{kinematics}} of its entire articular chain have not yet been quantified. Such investigation is essential to improve our understanding of thumb function and to develop better strategies to treat thumb joint pathologies. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} quantify the in vivo kinematics of the trapeziometacarpal (TMC) and scaphotrapezial (ST) joints during flexion and adduction of the thumb. In addition, we want to evaluate the potential coupling between the TMC and ST joints during these tasks. The hand of 16 asymptomatic women without signs of thumb osteoarthritis were CT scanned in positions of maximal thumb extension, flexion, abduction, and adduction. The CT images were segmented and three-dimensional surface models of the radius, scaphoid, trapezium, and the first metacarpal were created for each thumb motion. The corresponding rotations angles, translations, and helical axes were calculated for each sequence. The analysis shows that flexion and adduction of the thumb result in a three-dimensional rotation and translation of the entire articular chain, including the trapezium and scaphoid. A wider range of motion is observed for the first metacarpal, which displays a clear axial rotation. The coupling of axial rotation of the first metacarpal with flexion and abduction during thumb flexion supports the existence of a screw-home mechanism in the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint.</b> In addition, our results point to a potential motion coupling between the TMC and ST joints and underline the complexity of thumb kinematics. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

40|$|SummaryBackground:The {{functional}} {{index for}} hand osteoarthritis (FIHOA), a 10 -item investigator-administered questionnaire, was validated in 1995. It is relevant, reliable and has good {{external and internal}} validities. Objective:To assess the sensitivity to change over time of the FIHOA. Patients/Methods:Patients: symptomatic [visual analog scale (VAS) ≥ 30 mm, FIHOA ≥ 5] hand OA patients [American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, ≥ 2 radiologically affected joints] were included in a 6 -month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Recorded parameters: Pain on VAS, FIHOA score, morning stiffness duration, grip strength. Statistical analysis: mean standardized response (MSR=Δ DO-M 6 /s. D of Δ) was calculated for each parameter in an intention-to-treat (ITT) population before breaking the randomization code. Results: 239 women, 22 men, mean age 61 ± 7. 5 years were recruited. Characteristics of HOA: 88 % of patients were right-handed, 48 % had {{a family history of}} hand OA. The location of OA was the first trapezo-metacarpal (<b>TMC)</b> <b>joint</b> (62 %), proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint (47. 5 %), distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint (67. 6 %). The mean number of painful flares (previous 12 months) was 4. 4, that of painful joints was 3. 7, that of nodal joints in the right hand 3. 1, and that of radiologically affected joints was 4. 4. Baseline symptomatic severity assessment gave pain on VAS= 54. 4 ± 14 mm, FIHOA score= 10. 4 ± 3. 7, morning stiffness duration = 20 ± 27. 6 min and grip strength= 59. 3 ± 21. 2 mm Hg. The MSR value was 0. 58 for the FIHOA and 0. 87 for pain on VAS. Conclusion:The sensitivity to change of the FIHOA over 6 months is high, but inferior to that of pain on VAS in this trial...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and purpose}} - Radiostereometric {{analysis}} (RSA) {{is an accurate}} method for measurement of early migration of implants. Since a relation has been shown between early migration and future loosening of total knee and hip prostheses, RSA {{plays an important role}} in the development and evaluation of prostheses. However, there have been few RSA studies of the upper limb, and the value of RSA of the upper limb is not yet clear. We therefore performed a systematic review to investigate the accuracy and precision of RSA of the upper limb. Patients and methods - PRISMA guidelines were followed and the protocol for this review was published online at PROSPERO under registration number CRD 42016042014. A systematic search of the literature was performed in the databases Embase, Medline, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, Cinahl, and Google Scholar on April 25, 2015 based on the keywords radiostereometric analysis, shoulder prosthesis, elbow prosthesis, wrist prosthesis, trapeziometacarpal joint prosthesis, humerus, ulna, radius, carpus. Articles concerning RSA for the analysis of early migration of prostheses of the upper limb were included. Quality assessment was performed using the MINORS score, Downs and Black checklist, and the ISO RSA Results - 23 studies were included. Precision values were in the 0. 06 - 0. 88 [*]mm and 0. 05 - 10. 7 ° range for the shoulder, the 0. 05 - 0. 34 [*]mm and 0. 16 - 0. 76 ° range for the elbow, and the 0. 16 - 1. 83 [*]mm and 11 - 124 ° range for the <b>TMC</b> <b>joint.</b> Accuracy data from marker- and model-based RSA were not reported in the studies included. Interpretation - RSA is a highly precise method for measurement of early migration of orthopedic implants in the upper limb. However, the precision of rotation measurement is poor in some components. Challenges with RSA in the upper limb include the symmetrical shape of prostheses and the limited size of surrounding bone, leading to over-projection of the markers by the prosthesis. We recommend higher adherence to RSA guidelines and encourage investigators to publish long-term follow-up RSA studie...|$|E
