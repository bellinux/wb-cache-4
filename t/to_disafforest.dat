50|$|During {{the medieval}} period, {{the hills and}} {{surrounding}} area {{were part of a}} Royal forest known as Malvern Chase. Riots by commoners and legal challenges from land owners ensued when King Charles I attempted <b>to</b> <b>disafforest</b> the Chase in 1630. Ultimately, only one third was disafforested, and commissioners were appointed to ensure any further encroachments did not leave the common lands as the most meagre in quality. This system lasted until the 1800s.|$|E
50|$|The Corporation of Leicester {{opposed the}} efforts of Charles I of England <b>to</b> <b>disafforest</b> the nearby Leicester Forest, believing them {{to be likely to}} throw many of its {{residents}} into poverty and need of relief. Sir Miles Fleetwood was sent to commission the disafforestation and division of lands being used in common. Riots destroyed enclosures in spring 1627 and 1628, following a pattern of anti-enclosure disturbances found elsewhere including the Western Rising.|$|E
50|$|Sales of Royal lands, {{especially}} the large expanses of under-developed Royal forests {{also contributed to}} finances. Courtiers were asked to survey the lands, to provide programmes <b>to</b> <b>disafforest</b> these areas. The focus of the programme was disafforestation and sale of forest lands for development as pasture and arable, {{or in the case}} of the Forest of Dean, development for the iron industry. This included providing compensation to people using the lands in common, especially manorial lords and their tenants. Others who had settled illegally were not entitled to compensation and frequently rioted. The discontent following a major wave of sales was known as the Western Rising.|$|E
50|$|Sir Miles Fleetwood was {{commissioned}} <b>to</b> survey and <b>disafforest</b> Leicester in December 1626 and March 1627. Commoners were to receive compensation {{where they could}} show a valid claim; many {{would not be able}} to, if they had settled of their own accord. The Attorney General then ensured that the arrangements were confirmed by the court of Exchequer in February 1628. The King then let 1,598 acres to nearby landowners for 'fines' of Â£7,760 and small annual rents.|$|R
5000|$|In 1662 {{the forest}} was granted {{to one of}} Charles II's closest allies, George Digby, Earl of Bristol, and it was {{formally}} <b>disafforested</b> <b>to</b> allow Bristol a free hand to improve it. His attempts to do so were however frustrated [...] "by the crossness of the neighbourhood"; the fences he erected were thrown down and the crops he sowed were trampled by cattle. He defaulted on his rental payments to the Crown and left. Subsequent Lords of the Manor suffered similar opposition from the commoners. Compromise proposals were made to divide up the forest that would leave sufficient common land {{to meet the needs}} of commoners, while giving the rest up for improvement.|$|R
5000|$|A royal {{forest was}} an area {{reserved}} {{by the king}} for hunting, and William the Conqueror introduced the concept of forest law in England in the 11th century. Until 1204 the whole of Devon was a royal forest, but in that year King John agreed (subject to the payment by the county's [...] of a [...] "fine" [...] of 5,000 marks) <b>to</b> <b>disafforest</b> all of Devon [...] "up to the metes of the ancient regardes of Dertemore and Exmore, as these regardes were {{in the time of}} King Henry the First". In other words, all of Devon except for Dartmoor and Exmoor was freed from forest law.|$|E
