25|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Norway in 1940 during World War II the mines at Løkken {{became an important}} resource for the Germans. To avoid having to bomb the entire Thamshavn and Løkken areas, the Norwegian government-in-exile chose instead to sabotage key areas instead of large areas, of consideration the civilian population. While the mining company chose {{to cooperate with the}} Germans, but secretly not performed planned production increases, Company Linge performed a total of four sabotage actions against the Thamshavn Line, led by Peter Deinboll. The first targeted the <b>transformer</b> <b>station</b> that was successfully blown up on 4 May 1942. But it was quickly rebuilt by the Germans and a new sabotage was necessary. In the fall of 1943 the idea was to blow up the lift in the mine, but instead the group decided to blow up the locomotives on the railway. On 31 October, four locomotives and one rail car was blown up. This was not enough for the Deinboll, and an attempt to hijack a train at Klingliene and blow up part of the rail at the same stop failed, killing the saboteur Odd Nilsen.|$|E

The lot is located above Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani's Mine 3 and is leased to KSAT. The facility is connected to Longyearbyen via a [...] long private road. When the road is closed because of avalanches and land slides, helicopter transport is used. There is a road connecting all the antennas to ease maintenance. Installations at SvalSat not related to satellite communication include a measuring station for radioactive particles in the air operated by Norwegian Seismic Array, a telecommunications installation operated by Telenor, a weather station operated by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, with information relayed to Svalbard Airport, Longyear, and a weather station operated by SvalSat.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to design {{measures}} of the distribution network in Brno to ensure a supply of electricity to its consumers in required quantity, quality and reliability. This project will be solved in the program called PAS DAISY Off-Line v. 4. 00 Bizon. At first we make {{an analysis of the}} steady state of the distribution network. We check load of <b>transformer</b> <b>stations</b> 110 / 22 kV, overhead and cable lines if they operate in allowed limits. Then we complete or correct reserved power drains of big consumers of electricity in the model of distribution system. From the calculation of the steady state of the distribution network we will probably find out that some parts of the system are overloaded. Therefore we suggest changes for it (like switching over circuits, installation of new <b>transformer</b> <b>stations</b> and circuits), which should ensure safety and reliability of operations in the distribution system...|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the electric current in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg comes from Germany via two double high-voltage 220,000 volt (220 kV) lines that {{are connected to the}} German network. Creation of an interconnection with Belgium is under way, and around 15% of the energy fed into the network is produced locally (biogas, cogeneration, wind turbines, hydroelectricity and photovoltaics) The electricity is transmitted to the six <b>transformer</b> <b>stations</b> (Flebour, Roost, Itzig/Blooren, Heisdorf, Bertange and Schifflange) where the voltage is reduced from 220 to 65 kV before being distributed to industries and large municipal distribution networks. The voltage is then reduced from 65 kV to 20 kV in more than 60 <b>transformer</b> <b>stations</b> distributed across the whole country. The electric energy obtained is distributed to SMEs, towns and villages where the transformers reduce the current voltage to 0.4 kV before distributing it to the end consumer. A control centre, known as Electricity Dispatching, remotely controls and manages these high and medium-voltage networks.|$|R
