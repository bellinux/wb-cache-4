5|$|All of {{the tracks}} are powered with a <b>third</b> <b>rail,</b> except Track 1. The station has two {{high-level}} side platforms, each eight cars long.|$|E
5|$|Vestgrensa {{was part}} of Holmenkolbanen's {{operating}} network until 1975, when the municipality of Oslo bought all the company's stock. In the early 1990s, the stations on the Sognsvann Line were upgraded to metro standard, which involved a heightening and lengthening of the platforms, and installation of a <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> power supply and a new signaling system. The electrified <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> {{made it impossible for}} passengers to cross at track level, and under- or overpasses had to be built at all stations.|$|E
5|$|Later, Scully {{comes to}} see Doggett in the hospital. Scully informs him that Bianco and Melnick are with plastic surgeons, {{the boy is}} with social services, and no {{criminal}} charges will be pressed against Karras since the electrical charge of the <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> destroyed the proof of the medusas in the tunnel.|$|E
50|$|Electric current {{collectors}} {{are used}} by trolleybuses, trams, electric locomotives or EMUs to carry electrical power from overhead lines or electrical <b>third</b> <b>rails</b> to the electrical equipment of the vehicles. Those for overhead wires are roof-mounted devices, those for <b>third</b> <b>rails</b> are mounted on the bogies.|$|R
2500|$|Because {{alternating}} current is used with high voltages, {{this method of}} electrification is only used on overhead wires, never on <b>third</b> <b>rails.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{tram-train}} {{model was}} based around {{the use of}} modified T2000 metro trains, which could both use overhead wires and <b>third</b> <b>rails</b> ...|$|R
5|$|SIRT {{discontinued}} passenger {{service on}} the North Shore Branch to Arlington at midnight on March 31, 1953, because of city-operated bus competition, though the branch continued to carry freight. The <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> on the line was removed by 1955.|$|E
5|$|The MX3000 {{introduced}} {{a number of}} technical innovations to the metro. Regenerative brakes allow the dynamic brakes to feed the braking energy back to the power system via the <b>third</b> <b>rail.</b> The passengers also have air conditioning. The driver's cabs are more ergonomic than in the older models, and the mirrors to monitor the platforms have been replaced with cameras and screens. The trains' livery is white with gray detailing, instead of the former models' red with blue detailing. For use in areas without a <b>third</b> <b>rail,</b> such as at depots, the trains are equipped with a 110V battery. This will remove the need for shunting at the depots and cut costs.|$|E
5|$|The line carries four tracks, in two pairs. The {{northern}} pair {{are reserved}} {{for use by the}} S-Bahn, and are electrifed using a <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> carrying 800V DC. The S-Bahn tracks have platforms at all eleven stations along the Stadtbahn.|$|E
50|$|All Guangzhou Metro {{lines in}} {{operation}} except the APM are powered by 1,500 V DC. For power transmission, Lines 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8 {{as well as}} Guangfo Line use overhead lines, while Lines 4, 5 and 6 use <b>third</b> <b>rails.</b> Future lines {{to be built in}} the short term, such as Lines 9 and 13, will also run on 1,500 V DC supplied by overhead lines. In contrast to the heavy-rail lines, the light-rail APM runs on 600 V AC supplied by <b>third</b> <b>rails.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In all {{the subways}} of post-Soviet countries, the contact rail {{is made to}} the same standard. In particular, because carbon {{impurities}} increase electrical resistance, all <b>third</b> <b>rails</b> are made using low-carbon steel.|$|R
25|$|Other {{accidents}} {{in the history}} of the subway do not involve trains; several people have been fatally electrocuted by the subway's <b>third</b> <b>rails,</b> and yet others have been fatally pushed onto the tracks.|$|R
5|$|At present, all Singapore lines {{run with}} fixed length trains {{between three and}} six cars, with the future Thomson-East Coast Line using four cars. Since the system's {{conception}} in 1987, all train lines have been powered by the 750 volt DC <b>third</b> <b>rail,</b> {{with the exception of}} the North East Line which is powered by 1500 volt DC overhead lines. The North South and East West lines uses an automatic train operation system that is similar to London Underground's Victoria line.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the {{stations}} on the Sognsvann Line were rebuilt. The platforms were lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains and the platform height was increased. The <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> {{made it impossible}} to cross the line at-grade; an underpass was therefore constructed at Berg station. The station was also redesigned in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds designed by architect Arne Henriksen.|$|E
5|$|Nordberg {{was part}} of Holmenkolbanen's {{operating}} network until 1975, when the municipality of Oslo bought all the company's stock. In the early 1990s, the stations on the Sognsvann Line were upgraded to metro standard, which involves a heightening and lengthening of the platforms, installation of <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> power supply and a new signaling system. The <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> {{made it impossible to}} cross the line in-grade, and under- or overpasses had to be built at all stations. The transport authorities decided to close Nordberg, arguing that the access roads to the station were steep and dangerous, and icy during the winter. The residents of Nordberg opposed the closure of the station, arguing that it had served the area well with its central position in the area. Nevertheless, the station was closed, along with the level crossing that formerly had allowed for car traffic to cross the tracks. An underpass for pedestrians was constructed.|$|E
50|$|Because {{alternating}} current is used with high voltages, {{this method of}} electrification is only used on overhead wires, never on <b>third</b> <b>rails.</b> Inside the locomotive, a transformer steps the voltage down {{for use by the}} traction motors and auxiliary loads.|$|R
50|$|Almost {{all modern}} monorails are powered by {{electric}} motors fed by dual <b>third</b> <b>rails,</b> contact wires or electrified channels attached to or enclosed in their guidance beams, but diesel-powered monorail systems also exist. Historically some systems, {{such as the}} Lartigue Monorail, used steam locomotives.|$|R
2500|$|In 1940, the New York City Board of Transportation {{proposed}} that the IRT Lenox Avenue Line be extended to the Bronx along the northern portion of the IRT Ninth Avenue Line, in turn connecting to the IRT Jerome Avenue Line at 167th Street. However, the tunnel from Sedgwick Avenue to Anderson–Jerome Avenues was built to elevated-railway standards, whose [...] "open" [...] <b>third</b> <b>rails</b> were shorter than the subway's [...] "covered" [...] <b>third</b> <b>rails</b> because the [...] "open" [...] rails {{did not have any}} protective covers on top. This incompatibility prevented the connection from being built. Another issue was that the Ninth Avenue Line could not carry subway cars, as it was only strong enough to carry the lighter elevated cars.|$|R
5|$|Service on {{the subway}} system is {{occasionally}} disrupted by flooding from rainstorms, even minor ones. Rainwater can disrupt signals underground and require the electrified <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> to be shut off. Every day, the MTA moves 13 {{million gallons of water}} when it is not raining. Since 1992, $357 million has been used to improve 269 pump rooms. By August 2007, $115 million was earmarked to upgrade the remaining 18 pump rooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{low level}} station {{remained}} open, although passenger numbers at that station also fell {{after the fire}} of 1936 and many services were diverted to serve London–Croydon routes instead of the Victoria–London Bridge route. Rail travel was in decline across the UK in the 1960s and 1970s when the Beeching Axe was imposed. During the 1970s, two outer platforms used by terminating trains were abandoned and the <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> was removed.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnant of}} the IRT Ninth Avenue Line at 155th Street would connect with the IRT Lenox Avenue Line, giving riders of the Jerome Avenue Line service to Manhattan's West Side. This project was never {{undertaken}} {{because of the high}} cost of modifying the <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> in the Sedgwick Avenue and Anderson–Jerome Avenues tunnel section to accommodate new subway cars.|$|E
50|$|Parry People Movers Ltd. (PPM) is a British company {{manufacturing}} lightweight trams and railcars {{that use}} {{flywheel energy storage}} (FES) to store energy for traction, allowing electric systems to operate without overhead wires or <b>third</b> <b>rails,</b> and railcars fuelled by small gas, diesel or hydrogen engines.|$|R
5000|$|Chicago: The Chicago Transit Authority has a three-quarter union at Tower 18, {{located on}} the {{northwest}} corner of The Loop. This union has the notable distinctions of not only being built entirely on elevated bridgework over the streets below, but also being fully equipped with <b>third</b> <b>rails</b> for power distribution.|$|R
25|$|The Sarmiento line {{is managed}} by Trenes de Buenos Aires (TBA). The {{mainline}} has two railway {{stations in the}} partido: Merlo and San Antonio de Padua. The journey takes 45 minutes to Estación Once in Buenos Aires. The line uses electric locomotives which are powered by electricity picked up from <b>third</b> <b>rails.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{solution}} adopted was electrical power, provided via a <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> {{beneath the}} train, but offset {{to the west}} of centre for clearance reasons. Although the use of electricity to power trains had been experimented with during the previous decade, and small-scale operations had been implemented, the C was the first major railway in the world to adopt it as a means of motive power. The system operated using electric locomotives built by Mather & Platt collecting a voltage of 500 volts (actually +500volts in the northbound tunnel and −500volts in the southbound) from the <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> and pulling several carriages. A depot and generating station were constructed at Stockwell. Owing to the limited capacity of the generators, the stations were originally illuminated by gas. The depot was on the surface, and trains requiring maintenance were initially hauled up via a ramp although, following a runaway accident, a lift was soon installed. In practice, most rolling stock and locomotives went to the surface only for major maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Though Line A ran on a {{different}} voltage {{to the rest of}} the network, it was converted to the 1500v used on the rest of the network when the 200 Series trains began to arrive. On the other hand, Line B has traditionally been the most troublesome of the network given its different voltage and the fact that it uses <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> electrification as opposed to the overhead lines used on the rest of the network, making it in effect a separate entity not capable of sharing its stock with other lines. Presently this line uses 1960's rolling stock acquired from Tokyo's Eidan Marunouchi Line, along with CAF 5000 and CAF 6000 stock acquired from Madrid which are to replace the aging Eidan stock. The line, along with its remaining <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> stock, is being converted to overhead lines at 1500v, after which the entire network will be standardised.|$|E
5|$|Although a cable haulage {{system had}} {{initially}} been considered, Ramsgate Olympia decided {{early in the}} line's planning to electrify the line. A <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> system was rejected due to concerns {{for the safety of}} the large numbers of children expected to use the line, and the locomotives had trolley poles drawing power from a single 400-volt DC overhead line running the length of the tunnel. The wire ran along the wall of the old tunnel, on brackets in the roof of the new tunnel, and was supported by poles at the open-air stations. The electricity was supplied by an electrical substation built by English Electric, inside the tunnel near the lower end.|$|E
50|$|The fixed {{nature of}} a rail line makes it {{relatively}} easy to power EVs through permanent overhead lines or electrified <b>third</b> <b>rails,</b> {{eliminating the need for}} heavy onboard batteries. Electric locomotives, electric trams/streetcars/trolleys, electric light rail systems, and electric rapid transit are all in common use today, especially in Europe and Asia.|$|R
50|$|First, at {{the start}} of the 20th century, there was a phase of testing and {{technological}} exploration. <b>Third</b> <b>rails</b> and overhead lines were on trial in some lines in France; different voltages where tried. Afterwards, in the 1920s, the main lines starting from Paris and lines in the Pyrenees were electrified with 1,500 V DC.|$|R
50|$|As of 2005, {{the total}} length of railway is 2706 km. Of that, 923 km are broad gauge (1,676mm) tracks (mostly {{in the western}} region), and the {{remaining}} 1822 km are metre gauge tracks (mostly in the central and eastern regions). The gauge problem is being addressed by adding <b>third</b> <b>rails</b> to the most important broad and metre gauge routes, so that they become dual gauge.|$|R
5|$|Corzine {{has been}} the only New Jersey {{governor}} in recent memory to make any headway in addressing the crisis of municipal funding. While not directly touching the <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> of New Jersey governance – property taxes – Corzine's reform of the school funding formula (passed and signed in January 2008) resulted in significant relief to many New Jersey towns with outsize school costs but limited tax base. The plan survived a legal challenge and was declared constitutional by the New Jersey Supreme Court on May 28, 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, the Oslo City Council {{decided to}} build a four-line metro to the new suburbs {{to the east of}} the city center. The plans would lead to the system opening in 1966, after the {{conversion}} of the Østensjø and the Lambertseter Line of the Oslo Tramway to metro standard, and supplemented with the new Furuset and Grorud Line. The system would feature higher and longer platforms, allowing step-free access to six-car trains, automatic train protection and <b>third</b> <b>rail</b> power supply. This would make the metro incompatible with the existing tramways.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the Sognsvann Line {{was closed}} {{during the summer}} {{vacations}} due to improvements of the track and <b>third</b> <b>rail.</b> In 2008, the line was closed for approximately one week, due to leaves that had covered the tracks. The operation of the line was replaced by buses that served temporary stops in Nordbergveien and Sognsveien. In 2010, a truck was stuck under the train bridge between Holstein and Kringsjå over Carl Kjeldsens vei. The bridge was damaged, and allowed for only one-way-traffic for two weeks. Half the trains had to stop at Berg in the meantime.|$|E
50|$|The {{more modern}} station {{subsequently}} {{built by the}} Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) consists of two long concrete, elevated side platforms with dark-green painted steel shelters. Between them are the four tracks of {{this section of the}} Hudson Line, all with <b>third</b> <b>rails.</b> The inside tracks carry express trains, and diesel-powered Amtrak and Metro-North trains bound for the non-electrified sections between Croton-Harmon and the northern end of the line at Poughkeepsie, none of which stop at Philipse Manor. A green overpass connects the two platforms.|$|R
50|$|Commuter rail {{trains are}} usually {{composed}} of multiple units, which are self-propelled, bidirectional, articulated passenger rail cars with driving motors on each (or every other) bogie. Depending on local circumstances and tradition {{they may be}} powered either by diesel engines located below the passenger compartment (diesel multiple units) or by electricity picked up from <b>third</b> <b>rails</b> or overhead lines (electric multiple units). Multiple units are almost invariably equipped with control cabs at both ends, which is why such units are so frequently used to provide commuter services, due to the associated short turn-around time.|$|R
50|$|Construction of the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railroad {{started in}} 1901. Nine {{railroad}} bridges were {{required for the}} construction of the railroad. Most of the bridges were made of concrete, but some of the largest ones were not. The grade of the railroad on hills was 3%. The rails used weighed 95 pounds per yard. These rails were 30 feet (9 meters) long and on top of 8-inch by 6-inch ties. The ties for the <b>third</b> <b>rails</b> were 9 feet (3 meters) long. Wooden cars were used until 1916, when they were replaced by steel cars.|$|R
