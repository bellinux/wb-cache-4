We will review some recent such developments related to combinatorial group testing. In its most basic setting, the aim of group testing is to identify a set of "positive" individuals in a population of items by taking groups of items and asking {{whether there is a}} positive in each group. In particular, we will discuss explicit constructions of optimal or nearly-optimal group <b>testing</b> <b>schemes</b> using "randomness-conducting" functions. Among such developments are constructions of error-correcting group <b>testing</b> <b>schemes</b> using randomness extractors and condensers, as well as threshold group <b>testing</b> <b>schemes</b> from lossless condensers.

However, in the more likely case that only a very small proportion of the men are infected, a much more efficient <b>testing</b> <b>scheme</b> can be achieved. The feasibility of a more effective <b>testing</b> <b>scheme</b> hinges on the following property: we can pool the soldiers into groups, and in each group we can combine blood samples together. We can then test the combined sample to check if at least one soldier in the group has syphilis. This is the central idea behind group testing. If one or more of the soldiers in this group has syphilis, then a test is wasted (more tests need to be performed to find which soldier(s) it was). On the other hand, if no one in the pool has syphilis then many tests are saved, since we can eliminate every soldier in that group with just one test.|$|E

40|$|Modern Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) posses small features, {{and have}} gained {{popularity}} in mission-critical systems. However, due to small FPGA features and harsh external conditions {{that can be}} faced by a mission-critical system, an FPGA chip can suffer from faults. This in turn raises the need to test an FPGA to ensure a reliable system performance. However, a mission-critical system requires that the test process should be non-intrusive, i. e., applications 2 ̆ 6 amp; FPGA regions that are not being tested remain unaffected. Hence, an online <b>test</b> <b>scheme</b> is required that not only verifies the correctness of an FPGA, but also does not degrade the performance of other, running FPGA applications.

Test-generator/circuit compatibility is identified as a significant factor in testing large filters.

The frequency-domain characteristics of some basic <b>test</b> generation <b>schemes</b> are examined, and guidelines for test generator selection are proposed.
