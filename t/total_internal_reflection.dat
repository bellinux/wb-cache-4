25|$|The {{emerging}} {{field of}} photonic crystals {{led to the}} development in 1991 of photonic-crystal fiber, which guides light by diffraction from a periodic structure, rather than by <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> <b>reflection.</b> The first photonic crystal fibers became commercially available in 2000. Photonic crystal fibers can carry higher power than conventional fibers and their wavelength-dependent properties can be manipulated to improve performance.|$|E

40|$|A {{dewpoint}} sensor is described, {{based on}} the evanescent field generated at {{the surface of a}} silicon wafer. The wafer, polished on both surfaces, is used as a slab waveguide for light of wavelength 1330 nm. The light is coupled into high-order modes and undergoes multiple <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> <b>reflections</b> at the silicon/air interface. The critical angle shifts in response to the change in refractive index associated with condensation of water vapour on the exposed surface. Consequently, the modes are no longer confined and the resultant reduction in transmitted intensity provides a sensitive measure of the onset of condensation. This alternative to the well-established chilled mirror hygrometer may prove more amenable to the production of miniaturised, integrated sensor systems...|$|R
25|$|In optical tweezers, a {{continuous}} evanescent field {{can be created}} when light is propagating through an optical waveguide (multiple <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> <b>reflection).</b> The resulting evanescent field has a directional sense and will propel microparticles along its propagating path. This work was first pioneered by S. Kawata and T. Sugiura, in 1992, who showed that the field can be coupled to the particles in proximity {{on the order of}} 100 nanometers.|$|E
25|$|An {{optical fiber}} is a {{cylindrical}} dielectric waveguide (nonconducting waveguide) that transmits light along its axis, {{by the process}} of <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> <b>reflection.</b> The fiber consists of a core surrounded by a cladding layer, both of which are made of dielectric materials. To confine the optical signal in the core, the refractive index of the core must be greater than that of the cladding. The boundary between the core and cladding may either be abrupt, in step-index fiber, or gradual, in graded-index fiber.|$|E
25|$|Fiber {{with large}} core {{diameter}} (greater than 10micrometers) may be analyzed by geometrical optics. Such fiber is called multi-mode fiber, from the electromagnetic analysis (see below). In a step-index multi-mode fiber, rays of light are guided along the fiber core by <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> <b>reflection.</b> Rays {{that meet the}} core-cladding boundary at a high angle (measured relative to a line normal to the boundary), greater than the critical angle for this boundary, are completely reflected. The critical angle (minimum angle for <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> <b>reflection)</b> {{is determined by the}} difference in index of refraction between the core and cladding materials. Rays that meet the boundary at a low angle are refracted from the core into the cladding, and do not convey light and hence information along the fiber. The critical angle determines the acceptance angle of the fiber, often reported as a numerical aperture. A high numerical aperture allows light to propagate down the fiber in rays both close to the axis and at various angles, allowing efficient coupling of light into the fiber. However, this high numerical aperture increases the amount of dispersion as rays at different angles have different path lengths and therefore take different times to traverse the fiber.|$|E

In a more recent version of this experiment, many more embedded parhelia have been found using commercially available hexagonal BK7 glass crystals. Simple experiments like these can be used for educational purposes and demonstration experiments.

Here a new phenomenon is reported of wave localization that is attributable to neither of the above light guiding mechanisms. It is found that {{what is known as}} the Dirac point within a photonic band structure can play the role of a photonic bandgap with the establishment of field confinement. The new localized mode occurs at a Dirac frequency that is beyond any complete photonic bandgap, and exhibits a unique algebraic profile. The features of this new wave localization will add new capabilities and more flexibility to the design techniques of novel photonic components and photonic chip architectures...|$|R

25|$|The {{electromagnetic}} waves in a (metal-pipe) waveguide may be imagined as travelling down the guide in a zig-zag path, being repeatedly reflected between opposite {{walls of the}} guide. For the particular case of rectangular waveguide, {{it is possible to}} base an exact analysis on this view. Propagation in a dielectric waveguide may be viewed in the same way, with the waves confined to the dielectric by <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> <b>reflection</b> at its surface. Some structures, such as non-radiative dielectric waveguides and the Goubau line, use both metal walls and dielectric surfaces to confine the wave.|$|E
25|$|When light travels from {{a medium}} {{with a higher}} {{refractive}} index to one with a lower refractive index, Snell's law seems to require in some cases (whenever the angle of incidence is large enough) that the sine of the angle of refraction be greater than one. This of course is impossible, and the light in such cases is completely reflected by the boundary, a phenomenon known as <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> <b>reflection.</b> The largest possible angle of incidence which still results in a refracted ray is called the critical angle; {{in this case the}} refracted ray travels along the boundary between the two media.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of an}} {{intermediate}} layer to form an anti-reflection coating {{can be thought of}} as analoguous to the technique of impedance matching of electrical signals.

Further reduced reflection could in theory be made by extending the process to several layers of material, gradually blending the refractive index of each layer between the index of the air and the index of the substrate.|$|E

Figure 3 b shows the cross-sectional distribution of the optical generation rate in a single nanowire for a same incident wave power of 100 mW/cm 2 with different wavelengths (λ = 400, 600, 800 nm). The optical generation rate for small wavelengths (e.g., 400 nm) is concentrated near the top and sides of the nanowire due to the strong wire-wire light scattering and short absorption length of GaAs at these photon energies. However, the generation rates {{for most of the}} solar spectrum (e.g., 600 and 800 nm) are concentrated near the core, demonstrating the internal absorption enhancement mode in the nanowire.

40|$|Radiative heat {{transfer}} at the nanoscale {{is becoming an}} important technological issue {{with the development of}} nano electromechanical systems (NEMS). In this article, we derive asymptotic expressions to compute near-field radiative {{heat transfer}} between two planes of silicon. We identify two physical mechanisms that give the dominant contribution at small gaps. For intrinsic and low-doped silicon, the main contribution is due to evanescent waves coming from propagating waves undergoing frustrated <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> <b>reflections</b> at the interfaces. For doping levels larger than N-e= 10 (16) cm(- 3) surface mode coupling contributes to the heat transfer. Asymptotic expressions are also given in that case. In all cases, we compare analytical formulas with exact numerical calculations when varying the temperature and the doping concentration. We also give their range of validity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{new type}} small-angle sensor based on {{multiple}} <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> <b>reflections</b> and attenuated <b>total</b> reflections in heterodyne interferometry is presented. The small-angle sensor is designed as a reflective elongated prism that is made of BK 7 glass. The shorter-side surface of the reflective elongated prism was coated with 2 nm Ti-film and 45. 5 nm Au-film, but the longer-side surface of that was not coated with metal films. With the new type small-angle sensor, the small rotation angle can be obtained only by measuring the phase difference between the p-and s-polarization lights due to the multiple attenuated total-internal reflections (MATRs) and total-internal reflections (TIRs) effects. Its angular resolution can reach 72. 95 10 − × radian at least. The new type small-angle sensor has some merits, e. g., high resolution, high sensitivity, stability, and in real-time test, etc...|$|R
25|$|When light {{traveling}} in an optically dense medium hits a boundary at a steep angle (larger than the critical angle for the boundary), {{the light is}} completely reflected. This is called <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> <b>reflection.</b> This effect is used in optical fibers to confine light in the core. Light travels through the fiber core, bouncing back and forth off {{the boundary between the}} core and cladding. Because the light must strike the boundary with an angle greater than the critical angle, only light that enters the fiber within a certain range of angles can travel down the fiber without leaking out. This range of angles is called the acceptance cone of the fiber. The size of this acceptance cone {{is a function of the}} refractive index difference between the fiber's core and cladding.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{cells are}} {{commonly}} encapsulated in a transparent polymeric resin {{to protect the}} delicate solar cell regions for coming into contact with moisture, dirt, ice, and other conditions expected either during operation or when used outdoors. The encapsulants are commonly made from polyvinyl acetate or glass. Most encapsulants are uniform in structure and composition, which increases light collection owing to light trapping from <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> <b>reflection</b> of light within the resin. Research has been conducted into structuring the encapsulant to provide further collection of light. Such encapsulants have included roughened glass surfaces, diffractive elements, prism arrays, air prisms, v-grooves, diffuse elements, as well as multi-directional waveguide arrays. Prism arrays show an overall 5% increase in the total solar energy conversion. Active coatings that convert infrared light into visible light have shown a 30% increase.|$|E

However, high Q cavities on the order of {{the same size as the}} optical wavelength have been difficult to produce due to the inverse relationship between radiation losses and cavity size. When dealing with a cavity {{much larger than}} the optical wavelength, it is simple to design interfaces such that light ray paths fulfill <b>total</b> <b>internal</b> <b>reflection</b> conditions or Bragg reflection conditions. For light confined within much smaller cavities near the size of the optical wavelength, deviations from ray optics approximations become severe and it becomes infeasible, if not impossible to design a cavity which fulfills optimum reflection conditions for all three spatial components of the propagating light wave vectors.|$|E
