25|$|The Guardian {{reported}} on 4 July 2011 that Scotland Yard had discovered Dowler's voicemail had been accessed by journalists {{working for the}} News of the World and the newspaper's private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. The Guardian also reported that, during the police investigation into that newspaper's phone hacking activities, detectives discovered that journalists had deleted some messages—potential evidence—in Dowler's voicemail box because it was full, in order to free up space for new messages, to which they could listen. The deletions after Dowler was missing led family and friends to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> still alive. It was later reported that Dowler's phone automatically deleted messages 72 hours after they were listened to.|$|E
25|$|Chaka Khan {{was raised}} as a Catholic. She {{attributed}} {{her love of}} music to her grandmother, who introduced her to jazz as a child. Khan became a fan of rhythm and blues music as a pre-teen and at eleven formed a girl group, the Crystalettes, which included her sister Taka. In the late 1960s, Khan attended several civil rights rallies with her father's second wife, Connie, {{a strong supporter of}} the movement, and joined the Black Panther Party after befriending fellow member, activist, and Chicago native Fred Hampton in 1967. Though many <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> given the name Chaka while in the Panthers she {{has made it clear that}} her name Chaka Adunne Aduffe Hodarhi Karifi was given to her at age 13 by a Yoruba Baba. In 1969, she left the Panthers and dropped out of high school, having attended Calumet High School and Kenwood High School (now Kenwood Academy). She began to perform in small groups around the Chicago area, first performing with Cash McCall's group Lyfe, which included her then boyfriend Hassan Khan.|$|E
500|$|Anderson {{believed}} {{it was a bad}} idea for his character to get involved with a work colleague. Oliver began to doubt the relationship, and on Penny's advice, convinced Chrissie to break up with him without ruining his career. Chrissie took the break up well, and Hobley told What's on TV that her character did not mind, as [...] "it was only a bit of fun. She never planned on settling down with him." [...] It was then announced Chrissie would become pregnant with Oliver's child. Hobley assessed that Chrissie was surprised to learn that she was pregnant, but pleased, as she had lost a baby five years previously and did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> capable of conceiving another. Oliver was displeased by the news, but Chrissie had no expectations that he should provide for her. Her father, nursing consultant Mark Williams (Robert Powell), urged him to [...] "stand up to the mark and be a proper man". However, soon after, Chrissie miscarried their unborn baby.|$|E

I believe that while Amanda Knox did not wield the knife herself, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> there, with her boyfriend, and that he did the deed, and that she egged him on. That's what I think happened...I just happen to know the facts...I'm not trying to get Amanda Knox's first interview because… my show does not pay for interviews...Second, I don't think she's going to tell the truth anyway, so what's the point?" ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{native of}} Nashville, Tennessee, Page lived in California {{in her early}} adult years before moving to New York City to pursue work as an actress. There, she began to find work as a pin-up model, and posed for dozens of photographers {{throughout}} the 1950s. Page was [...] "Miss January 1955", {{one of the earliest}} Playmates of the Month for Playboy magazine. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a remarkable lady, an iconic figure in pop culture who influenced sexuality, taste in fashion, someone who had a tremendous impact on our society," [...] said Playboy founder Hugh Hefner to the Associated Press in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 February 1722, [...] Captain Chaloner Ogle of the HMS Swallow {{came upon}} the pirate ships Royal Fortune, Ranger, and Little Ranger {{careening}} at Cape Lopez. The Swallow veered away to avoid a shoal, making the pirates <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a fleeing merchant ship. The Ranger departed in pursuit, commanded by James Skyrme. Once out of earshot of the other pirates, the Swallow opened her gun ports and opened fire. Ten pirates were killed and Skyrme had his leg taken off by a cannonball, {{but he refused to}} leave the deck. Eventually, the Ranger was forced to strike her colors and the surviving crew were captured.|$|E

2500|$|On June 24, 1937, Pickford {{married her}} third and last husband, actor and band leader Buddy Rogers. They adopted two children: Roxanne (born 1944, adopted 1944) and Ronald Charles (born 1937, adopted 1943, a.k.a. Ronnie Pickford Rogers). As a PBS American Experience {{documentary}} noted, Pickford's {{relationship with her}} children was tense. She criticized their physical imperfections, including Ronnie's small stature and Roxanne's crooked teeth. Both children later said their mother was too self-absorbed to provide real maternal love. In 2003, Ronnie recalled that [...] "Things didn't work out that much, you know. But I'll never forget her. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a good woman." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{think that}} the chorus was divided in two halves, who would each have their own leader; {{at the beginning and}} close of their performance, the two halves performed as a single group, but during most of the performance, each half would compete with the other, claiming that their leader or favorite was the best of all the girls in Sparta. [...] There is, however, little evidence that the chorus was in fact divided. The role of the other woman of Alcman's first partheneion, Aenesimbrota, is contested; some consider her indeed a competing chorus-leader, others <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> some sort of witch, who would supply the girls in love with magic love-elixirs like the pharmakeutria of Theocritus's Second Idyll, and others again argue that she was the trainer of the chorus like Andaesistrota of Pindar's Second Partheneion ...|$|E
2500|$|Tad is furious, however, that Dixie let him and JR <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{dead for}} four years without a word. He grows even angrier when he learns that she gave away Kate after letting Greg Madden {{convince}} her that Tad could not love a daughter, who, Madden claimed, would remind him of Dixie's death {{too much for him}} to love the child properly. Tad vents his anger while testifying at Dixie's trial when she stands accused of Greg Madden's murder. Afterwards, though, the two begin to reconcile. Tad invites her for a date one morning, and Dixie accepts. However, in 2007, she dies that day after eating poisoned pancakes that were meant for her daughter-in-law (Babe). Babe's attempted murderer is known as the Satin Slayer, a serial killer killing off the women of Fusion Cosmetics. Dixie's ghost/spirit later sees Tad playing with a little 4-year-old named Kathy and instinctively knows that the little girl is actually their lost daughter [...] Kate. At first, no one else in Pine Valley knows this but Dixie. Adam, however, later discovers the child alive and keeps the knowledge to himself. He is conflicted {{on a number of occasions}} on whether to tell Tad, but ultimately decides against it when he finds out that Tad has married the woman he loves, Krystal Carey.|$|E

2500|$|During December 1915 and January 1916 Lord Clive was {{stationed}} in the Thames Estuary to shoot down approaching German Zeppelins with shrapnel shells fired by her main guns, but she was denied a chance to waste ammunition when the Zeppelins never came within range. She bombarded German batteries at Westende on 26 January using the newly developed air-spotting techniques, but she only fired about eleven rounds during the half-hour bombardment. This was the last bombardment {{for the next seven}} months as the monitors were used to support British light forces, minefields and net defenses in the Channel. Lord Clive was refitted during this period with a pair of six-inch guns to enhance her armament against German ships. This came in handy on 8 June when she, along with other monitors and destroyers, rebuffed an attempt by a dozen German ships to clear the nets and sweep the minefields. Lord Clive participated in a deception operation on 8 July when she, as well as French [...] guns, fired blanks to cover the fire of the brand-new 12-inch Dominion Battery at Adinkerke bombarding the Tirpitz Battery. She was fitted with dummy second funnel to make the Germans <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a new monitor. The idea was to deceive the Germans as to the true origin of the shells landing around the battery, but the Germans were not totally deceived and retaliated against the French guns. Shortly afterwards they deployed a smokescreen to hide the battery which hampered spotting and they also located the Dominion Battery and fired against it.|$|E
