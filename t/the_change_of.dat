40|$|Background: Flavonoid is an {{antioxidant}} {{which can}} be found in celery (Apium graviolens). It is assumed that flavonoid has hepatoprotector effect. The purpose of this research is to verify the effect of flavonoid to liver function in male wistar applied with carbon tetrachloride. Method: This is an experimental study, using the post test only control group design. The samples were 20 male wistars which divided into 2 groups. The control group, 10 rats, given standard diet for a week then applied with carbon tetrachloride in the 8 th day. The treatment group, 10 rats, given standard diet plus celery extract for a week then applied with carbon tetrachloride in the 8 th day. The data obtained from this study was <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> SGOT/SGPT level. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the distribution was abnormal (p< 0, 05) so non parametric test was chosen (Mann-Whitney test). The result of Mann-Whitney test showed a significant difference (p< 0, 01). Result: From the control group, <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> SGOT level was 474, 50 and <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> SGPT level was 709, 40.

The analysis of Lithuanian and foreign literature showed that impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> economic situation on company results has been very poorly explored. The company bankruptcy valuation question is more popular among researchers, but we think, that the tasks to identify the circumstances that warn about <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> company results in advance, to adapt the company to new business conditions and to block the way to bankruptcy are more important. The aim {{of this article is}} to define how <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> economic situation in the state influence the results of Lithuanian companies and their bankruptcy risk. The general data that include all sectors and all companies in this country are used in this research. The correlation analysis and regression analysis are used in order to establish the relation between company results and <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> in economic situation that are reflected by <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> general domestic product (GDP). The investigation of the relationship between companies' results and <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> GDP showed that the number of companies and the number of bankruptcies in the state are directly dependent on <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> GDP in a year. The authors showed that there is strong linear dependence between <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> GDP and <b>the</b> main financial ratios <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company: <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> in sales, changes in gross profit and various profitability ratios.
