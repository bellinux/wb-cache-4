5|$|On February 25, 1970, the 11 Westinghouse-powered cars {{intended}} for Harrisburg service completed their performance testing. Penn Central {{refused to accept}} the cars, citing numerous technical issues with <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> their general unsuitability for the service. They had worse acceleration than the Silverliners already in service, tended to overheat when making numerous closely spaced stops, and had difficulty climbing the grade out of Suburban Station. Additionally, the corridor lacked high-level platforms to effectively use <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> 15 substations would require expensive modifications. The 11 cars were unused for some time before Penn Central ultimately decided to lease the cars for use on the core New York - Washington service. They were moved back to the Budd plant for modifications in April. In July, the state authorized $100,000 to upgrade Silverliners for the Harrisburg service instead.|$|E

He sold the company for £100,000 at the end of 1971 to British businessman Bernie Ecclestone, Rindt's former manager and erstwhile owner of the Connaught team. Tauranac stayed on to design <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> run the factory.|$|E

5|$|The shape I {{have adopted}} {{is that of}} an ellipse, formed by bisecting, on each side, the {{horizontal}} ordinates of a circle of 32 feet diameter, down to its center, below which the sides are to be made vertical, if no arch is necessary lower down; otherwise, the ellipse is to continue {{down to the bottom}} and to be shaped all round with bricks, stones, or iron, as may appear most eligible. This shape leaves ample room for <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> <b>and,</b> by contracting the roof, is more secure than a semicircle of 16 feet diameter.|$|E

40|$|Wind energy {{generated}} from the wake of moving cars has a large energy potential {{that has not yet}} been utilized. In this study, a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) was used to recover energy from the wakes of moving <b>cars.</b> <b>The</b> turbine was designed to be planted by the side of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> lane <b>and</b> driven by the wake produced by <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to evaluate the performance of the VAWT. The influence of two main factors on the performance of the VAWT, the velocity of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gap between <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rotor, were studied. The simulations confirmed the feasibility of this plan, and in the tested cases, the VAWT was able to generate a maximum energy output of 100. 49 J from the wake of a <b>car.</b> <b>The</b> results also showed that the performance of the VAWT decreased with the velocity of <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> increased gap between <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> VAWT...|$|R
5000|$|In December 1992, Detective Pautz of the Milwaukee Sheriff's Department was {{conducting}} drug interdiction {{when he noticed}} a 1981 two door Oldsmobile with California plates. [...] Pautz radioed his dispatcher to check the registration of <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> he ran <b>the</b> name of the owner, Miguel Ledesma Ornelas, through the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Information System (NADDIS). NADDIS reported that Ornelas was a heroin dealer. Two more officers arrived on the scene. An officer asked Ornelas {{if he had any}} contraband in <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> Ornelas responded negatively. Detective Hurrle requested permission to search <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> Ornelas consented.

5|$|After {{the arrival}} of the strikebreakers on the {{afternoon}} of November 2, Indianapolis Police Chief Martin Hyland had mounted city police escort them from Indianapolis Union Station to the company's maintenance and storage carhouses, one block south of the terminal building. The police broke a path through the strikers to allow the strikebreakers into the building so they could prepare to launch the cars. Organized labor leaders held two mass meetings and unions across the city agreed to send additional men to support the strikers against the strikebreakers. A riot began as the strikebreakers attempted to restore transit service. Whenever the strikebreakers launched a streetcar from the storage barns, the strikers attacked them with rocks and brick. They boarded the streetcars, dragged the crews from <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> lit the cars on fire. Many injuries occurred on both sides and ambulances were called to carry the injured to a hospital. After the destruction of six cars, the strikebreakers abandoned their attempts to restart service.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945 a trainload of 250 Jews who {{had been}} {{rejected}} as workers at a mine in Goleschau in Poland arrived at Brünnlitz. The boxcars were frozen shut when they arrived, and Emilie Schindler waited while an engineer from the factory opened the cars using a soldering iron. Twelve people were dead in <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> <b>and</b> the remainder were too ill and feeble to work. Emilie took the survivors into the factory and cared for them in a makeshift hospital {{until the end of}} the war. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the slaughter of his workers as the Red Army approached. On 7 May 1945 he and his workers gathered on the factory floor to listen to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announce over the radio that Germany had surrendered, and the war in Europe was over.|$|E
5|$|Quantum of Solace was {{the last}} in Ford Motor's three-film deal that began with 2002's Die Another Day. Although Ford sold over 90% of the Aston Martin company in 2007, the Aston Martin DBS V12 {{returned}} for the film's car chase around Lake Garda; Dan Bradley was hired as second unit director because of {{his work on the}} second and third Bourne films, so the film would continue the gritty action style begun in Casino Royale. He had intended to use Ford GTs for the opening chase, but it was replaced by the Alfa Romeo 159. After location filming in Italy, further close-ups of Craig, <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> the truck were shot at Pinewood against a blue screen. Originally three Alfa Romeos were in the sequence: but Forster felt the scene was running too long and re-edited the scene so it only looked like two Romeos were chasing Bond. Six Aston Martins were destroyed during filming, {{and one of them was}} purchased by a fan.|$|E

5|$|The game's visuals and {{spectacle}} were lauded {{by critics}} who suspected {{that it would}} amaze players. Reed questioned {{whether it was the}} best looking game to have ever been made. Critics observed that the use high frame rate and motion blur helped convey an incredible sense of speed. Other aspects such particle effects, reflections, and real-time deformation drew praise as well. Critics expressed approval over the sound design of <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> collisions. However opinions of the licensed soundtrack and DJ were less favourable. Some writers found the DJ's enthusiastic dialogue to be annoying and had mixed opinions on the songs included in the soundtrack, but were thankful for the available audio customisation options.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{has drawn}} {{influence}} {{from a number}} of musical genres. As a teenager, he mostly listened to 1960s folk and religious music, including the Christian singer-songwriter Larry Norman. For playing on his junior high baseball team, he was given Leon Russell's 1970 debut album, which he says influenced some of his vocalizing. Later in high school and in college, he discovered punk music (Black Flag), along with bands from other genres, such as the new wave band <b>The</b> <b>Cars</b> <b>and</b> the obscure Angst. While in Boston in 1984, before starting the Pixies, he listened to Hüsker Dü's Zen Arcade, The Spotlight Kid by Captain Beefheart, and I'm Sick of You, an Iggy Pop bootleg. Thompson was also greatly influenced by the Beatles self-titled 1968 release (known as White Album) with regards to the experimental nature of his compositions (especially those featured in Doolittle).|$|E
5|$|A {{technology}} demo for Forza Motorsport 4 {{was first}} revealed at Microsoft's E3 2010 press conference. The live demonstration showcased a passing challenge while driving the 2010 Ferrari 458 Italia. Using the Microsoft Kinect sensor the player steered {{the car to}} pass opponents. Forza Motorsport 4 was formally unveiled at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards. Turn 10 announced that the game would feature over 500 cars from 80 manufacturers, and confirmed that it will support Kinect as well as standard Xbox 360 controllers and racing wheels. Turn 10 officially partnered with the American Le Mans Series (ALMS) for two years from August 8, 2011. The partnership provides several in-game ALMS themed events to complement <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> tracks raced in the ALMS present in previous entries in the Forza Motorsport series. Unlike past games in the series, vehicles from the SCCA Pro Racing World Challenge were not present initially in Forza Motorsport 4 aside from a Mopar sponsored Dodge Viper. The Porsche download content pack added one World Challenge Porsche GT3. More known content was leaked during IGN's visit to E3 2011, which revealed {{that there will be}} the option to create car clubs and share garages within that club, and that the game will support 16 player online racing. Hockenheimring, Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Infineon Raceway were added as three more real world tracks to the Forza series.|$|E

5|$|At the start, several drivers {{made contact}} with one another into turn two. Sebastian Vettel {{was hit in the}} rear by Daniil Kvyat there and during turn three, the latter of which caused him to crash into the barrier and retire from the competition. Further back, Nico Hülkenberg was hit by Esteban Gutiérrez and {{collected}} Rio Haryanto, forcing both Hülkenberg and Haryanto into retirement as well. As the safety car came out to allow for <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> debris to be cleared from the track, several cars headed to the pit lane to repair damage, among them Daniel Ricciardo, Daniil Kvyat and Sergio Pérez. The order at the restart on lap four was: Rosberg, Räikkönen, Bottas, Massa and Hamilton, who had stayed clear of the incidents to move up to fifth. On the restart, Bottas moved ahead of Räikkönen, while Hamilton made a successful move on Massa into fourth. Kvyat's early pit stop left him in 15th at that point, and he soon served a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for his contacts with Vettel, dropping him to last. Meanwhile, Hamilton overtook Räikkönen to move into third on lap seven. Felipe Nasr came into the pit lane on lap 12 to replace a slow puncture on his tyres. The order at the front remained the same until Bottas became the first front runner to pit for fresh tyres on lap 17. Hamilton followed suit one lap later, but still emerged behind Bottas, overtaking him into turn two another lap later. On lap 20, Räikkönen made a pit stop as well, coming back out behind Hamilton, but ahead of Bottas. All the while, Rosberg led comfortably ahead of Max Verstappen, who made his first stop on lap 23 and dropped back.|$|E
5|$|Because Stretford is {{situated}} on the main A56 road between Chester and Manchester many travellers passed through the village, and as this traffic increased, more inns were built to provide travellers with stopping places. One of the earliest forms of public transport through Stretford was the stagecoach; the Angel Hotel, on the present day site {{of what used to}} be the Bass Drum public house, was one of the main stopping places for stagecoaches in Stretford, and the Trafford Arms was another. The stagecoach service through Stretford is believed to have ended some time in the 1840s, about the time that horse-drawn omnibuses arrived, in 1845. The Manchester Carriage Company's tramway from Manchester to Stretford was built in 1879, terminating at the Old Cock Hotel on the A56 road, next to which a small depot was built to house <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>and</b> horses. A 1900 timetable shows that trams left for Manchester every 10minutes between 8:00am and 10:15pm. The horse-drawn trams were replaced with electric trams in 1902, and after the Second World War the trams were replaced by buses.|$|E
