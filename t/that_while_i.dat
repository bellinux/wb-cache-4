500|$|Both Compton and Groves {{proposed}} that DuPont operate the semiworks. Williams counter-{{proposed that}} the semiworks be {{operated by the}} Metallurgical Laboratory. He reasoned that it would primarily be a research and educational facility, and that expertise was to {{be found at the}} Metallurgical Laboratory. Compton was shocked; the Metallurgical Laboratory was part of the University of Chicago, and therefore the university [...] would be operating an industrial facility [...] from its main campus. James B. Conant told him that Harvard University [...] "wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole", but the University of Chicago's Vice President, Emery T. Filbey, took a different view, and instructed Compton to accept. When University President Robert Hutchins returned, he greeted Compton with [...] "I see, Arthur, <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> was gone you doubled the size of my university".|$|E
500|$|Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a {{positive}} review, {{stating that the}} reveal was [...] "an effective narrative, and one which creates a [...] "satisfying" [...] resolution for the viewer {{as well as the}} character. Veronica Mars {{has done a good job}} of subverting expectations on a regular basis, but it’s still a TV show, with requirements for satisfying resolutions. [...] Which is my roundabout way of saying <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> wasn’t surprised by the reveal that it was Duncan Kane, I was impressed by how well it worked up to that point. It had to be Duncan or someone totally irrelevant and shocking." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A+", its fourth such rating for the series, after [...] "An Echolls Family Christmas", [...] "Clash of the Tritons", and [...] "M.A.D.".|$|E
500|$|The women held a vote as {{to whether}} Balukas {{should be allowed to}} play. She later {{explained}} that [...] "what hurt at Binghamton was <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> was trying to stand up for us being treated the same as men, the other girls held the tournament draw without me. By one vote, they kept me out. And some of the girls who are my best friends voted against me." [...] She did not agree at the time with the speculation of others that her professional rivals had their own self-interest at heart, knowing that with her out of the competition they would have a much better chance at the $5,000 first place prize award. Despite the women's snub and perceived chauvinistic terms, she nevertheless competed on the men's side, tying for ninth place. Not long afterward, she indicated to a reporter that she was [...] "thinking of dropping out of women's competition altogether." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrew Craigie {{bought the}} house in 1791; Craigie {{had been the first}} Apothecary General of the American army. In his ballroom, Craigie hosted Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the father of Queen Victoria. While living in the home, he married the {{daughter}} of a Nantucket clergyman, 22-year-old Elizabeth Craigie, 17 years her elder. Craigie overspent in trying to restore the home and, when he died in 1819, he left his wife Elizabeth in great debt; Mrs. Craigie took in boarders to support herself, most often people connected to nearby Harvard University. Short-term residents of the home included Jared Sparks, Edward Everett, and Joseph Emerson Worcester. Sparks, who moved into the home in April 1833, was then preparing a biography of Washington based on original documents. He recorded in his journal: [...] "It is a singular circumstance <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> am engaged in preparing for the press the letters of General Washington which he wrote at Cambridge after taking command of the American army, I should occupy the same rooms that he did at that time." [...] Another lodger was Sarah Lowell, an aunt of James Russell Lowell.|$|E
2500|$|Suffering financially, the Leader {{was sold}} on in March 1938 to Paul Holmes. Although no {{immediate}} changes {{were taken in}} the paper's editorial stance, editorialist John Work later recalled [...] "for a little while I could write socialist editorials, but it soon appeaered <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> could write socialist editorials, I was expected not to make much {{use of the word}} 'socialism.' I stayed on, knowing that I could still do some good work for the cause, and not knowing but that the socialists might again get control of the paper." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1889, Healy paid a {{courtesy}} {{call to the}} skipper of USRC Rush, Captain Leonard G. Shepard, in an intoxicated state, a serious breach of naval etiquette. Shortly thereafter, Shepard became the Chief of the Revenue Cutter Bureau and he wrote Healy warning {{him that if he}} could not control his drinking, he could face loss of command. Healy replied stating that he [...] "pledge to you by all I hold most sacred <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> live never to touch intoxicants of any kind or description....One thing I will hate and that is to give up my command of the Bear. I love the ship, tho [...] hard work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you then}} wish to {{take refuge in}} death?" [...] she asked darkly. [...] "Of this be sure, my guests, <b>that</b> never <b>while</b> <b>I</b> live shall you be allowed to cross the river which borders the slopes of yonder peak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say not so. I {{have named}} to-night for an {{interview}} with my agent, and I know thy maternal heart too well, to doubt thy being willing to spare me for <b>that</b> time, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> look to the interests of these dear ones." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{the change}} we see in him; this made him watch me, hoping I had forgotten, as I once said and believed. I should be glad, I will be glad, and let him see <b>that</b> even <b>while</b> <b>I</b> suffer I can rejoice in that which helps us both." ...|$|R
2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Gilby Clarke, {{who does}} not appear on the {{recording}}, noted that the recording foreshadowed his departure from the band, stating: [...] "They did <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> {{was on the road}} touring for my solo record. [...] I knew that that was the ending because nobody told me about it. Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me. That {{was one of the last}} straws for me, because nobody had said anything to me, and they recorded a song by one of my favorite bands. It was pretty clear I'm a big Rolling Stones fan, and they recorded the song without me. So I knew that was it." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{arrived at}} the University of Florida on my 25th {{birthday}} in September 1957. Having completed {{four years in the}} Air Force, I was anxious to move ahead quickly with my education, and get on to a working career. [...] …I was called in to be interrogated three or four times during the next two years. Each time, it was the same setting, and the same set of questions. Each time I was unceremoniously marched out of class, in front of the instructor and all my classmates, by a uniformed policeman. Once this occurred during a final exam in accounting. [...] …At each interrogation, I refused to tell them anything. [...] Each time I was amazed <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> was truly terrified by their tactics and their threats, I was able to stonewall their questions and refuse to give them the answers they were so desperate for. I came to realize that they, as a group, were really a very dumb bunch of redneck, illiterate people, clumsily wielding a vast amount of power over others.|$|E
2500|$|Jamie Anne Allman {{spoke about}} the shock of {{learning}} that her character Terry Marek was Rosie Larsen's killer: [...] "Veena Sud had called me a couple hours before I was going in to read for the table read for episode 13, the last episode, that I was the killer. When {{she gave me the}} news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure everybody on the cast was wondering if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved." [...] This scene was in the Ogi Jun episode.|$|E

60|$|I {{am being}} appealed to from Louisville against your {{withdrawing}} troops from <b>that</b> place. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> cannot pretend to {{judge of the}} propriety {{of what you are}} doing, you would much oblige me by furnishing me a rational answer to make to the governor and others at Louisville.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} {{hear you}} say so, Jean. It has been terrible waiting here, and knowing that you {{were in the midst of}} dangers, and <b>that</b> even <b>while</b> <b>I</b> thought of you, you might be lying dead.

6000|$|... "Fortunately I have my case of {{instruments}} with me," [...] said the doctor, spreading {{on the bench}} a long array of tiny, glittering implements of torture.

6000|$|... "I think I am," [...] {{he owned}} without reflection. [...] "The trouble is <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> may deserve it on general grounds, I'm {{unconscious}} of having done anything very reprehensible in particular." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then don't think I will. I 'm {{a pretty}} poor affair, Polly, but I 'm not mean {{enough to do}} <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> 've got a {{conscience}} {{and a pair of}} hands." ...|$|E
