It drew heavily on earlier research by Alan Kay, who had previously developed the Dynabook project. While the Dynabook was a concept for a <b>transportable</b> <b>computer</b> that was impossible to implement with available technology, the NoteTaker was intended to show what could be done.|$|E

By 1957, the C1102 had been used by a civilian sector customer. The BASICPAC AN/TYK 6V, COMPAC AN/TYK 4V, and LOGIPAC systems were built for the US Army as <b>transportable</b> <b>computer</b> systems for use with their Fieldata concept of integrated information management.|$|E

It favorably cited the {{improved}} keyboard, internal power supply, and Macintosh/IIGS-compatible serial port, but said that the computer [...] "isn't everything it could be", criticizing the lack of change from the IIc's memory capacity ("128K doesn't quite cut it") and difficulty in adding more. The magazine concluded, [...] "It's disappointing that a company as technologically sophisticated as Apple couldn't have gone a step further ... The IIc Plus is a nice system, but it's too little, too late". A separate editorial in the issue began [...] "What if you announced a new computer and nobody cared? Apple Computer could be facing such a dilemma". Even with an accompanying price increase for the IIGS, the magazine stated that [...] "unless you really want a small, easily <b>transportable</b> <b>computer,</b> there's little reason to buy the IIc Plus over the IIGS ... the improvements over the IIc simply aren't that significant". Regarding the 3.5-inch drive the magazine stated, [...] "there are thousands of good, affordable programs that won't be released in 3 1/2-inch format ... bargain hunters will want access to classic educational and entertainment programs that are available only on 5 1/4-inch disks". While praising Apple for continuing to support Apple II owners the editorial criticized the company for announcing [...] "a new product that uses old technology" [...] at a price {{higher than that of}} the Laser 128 EX/2 or an inexpensive PC clone, comparing the IIc Plus to the unsuccessful IBM PCjr. It concluded that [...] "the IIc Plus simply clouds the Apple II picture".|$|E

40|$|A dual {{underwater}} {{camera system}} connected, synchronized and powered via cable to a waterproof <b>transportable</b> <b>computer,</b> was developed. This device {{was used for}} acquiring tuna images during the transfer from fishing net to a floating cage, thus validating the potential advantages {{of the use of}} underwater video monitoring. Two images per second were recorded during tuna transfer and stored for biometric analyses, which were carried out by means of a software tool based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The ANN was trained to convert distance between pixels in each pair of images into distance between points in the real objects, automatically correcting the estimates for distance from the cameras and aspect. The ANN-based software tool allowed analysing tuna transfer images, providing biometric information of about 1000 tunas. The results were compared to conventional assessment methods.

40|$|Some {{fundamental}} principles for developing computer programs which {{are compatible with}} array-oriented computers are presented. The emphasis is on basic techniques for structuring computer codes which are applicable in FORTRAN and do not require a special programming language or exact a significant penalty on a scalar computer. Researchers who are using numerical techniques to solve problems in engineering can apply these basic principles and thus develop <b>transportable</b> <b>computer</b> programs (in FORTRAN) which contain much vectorizable code. The vector architecture of the ASC is discussed so that the requirements of array processing can be better appreciated. The "vectorization" of a finite-difference viscous shock-layer code is used as an example to illustrate the benefits {{and some of the}} difficulties involved. Increases in computing speed with vectorization are illustrated with results from the viscous shock-layer code and from a finite-element shock tube code. The applicability of these principles was substantiated through running programs on other computers with array-associated computing characteristics, such as the Hewlett-Packard (H-P) 1000 -F...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — {{the idea}} of this {{research}} is for the concern of Collaborative learning based mobile factors by applying via pharmacy students of the college. We focus on three features, computer mutual learning, learning process module, and student learning mode. In this paper, student-focused instruct module, student edge section, teacher interface section, learner section, solution problem section, curriculum section, control section, and diagnose section are planned. This system permits students to be sustained with a real time approach, non-real time approach, mixture approach. The devices used contain smart phone, PDAs, mobile devices, <b>transportable</b> <b>computers</b> and tablet PDAs. This system is to become a more capable student learning environment so that student can get student’s learning done more efficiently. The development of a collaborative learning combines the advantages of an adaptive learning environment with the advantages of mobile telecommunication and the suppleness of mobile devices.

40|$|We {{describe}} a methodology for constructing parallel algorithms that are <b>transportable</b> among parallel <b>computers</b> having different numbers of processors, different bandwidths of interprocessor communication and different periodicity of global synchronisation. We {{do this for}} the bulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) model, which abstracts {{the characteristics of a}} parallel machine into three numerical parameters p, g, and L, corresponding to processors, bandwidth, and periodicity respectively. The model differentiates memory that is local to a processor from that which is not, but, for the sake of universality, does not differentiate network proximity. The advantages of this model in supporting shared memory or PRAM style programming have been treated elsewhere. Here we emphasise the viability of an alternative direct style of programming where, for the sake of efficiency the programmer retains control of memory allocation. We show that optimality to within a multiplicative factor close to one ca [...] ...|$|R
