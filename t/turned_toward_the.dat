5|$|After {{reaching}} a position about 240mi (385km) {{northeast of the}} Turks and Caicos Islands, the depression <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> north after a trough created a weakness in the ridge. After a decrease in wind shear, deep convection redeveloped over the center, and Olga re-intensified into a tropical storm on December2.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{north of}} Taiwan, Rananim made {{landfall}} at peak intensity around 1300UTC on August12, near Wenling in Zhejiang province in China. The China Meteorological Administration {{reported that the}} typhoon was the strongest to hit Zhejiang since Typhoon Sally in 1956. Moving over land, the typhoon quickly weakened to tropical storm status as it <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> west. Early on August13, the JMA downgraded Rananim to a tropical depression and issued the last warning; by that time, the circulation was over Jiangxi. The depression lasted another two days before dissipating over northwest Hunan.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Fanele was {{the first}} cyclone of {{tropical}} cyclone status to strike western Madagascar since Cyclone Fame one year prior. It formed on January18, 2009 in the Mozambique Channel, and rapidly organized as it remained nearly stationary. Fanele ultimately <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> southwest Madagascar coastline, reaching peak winds of 185km/h (115mph), according to the Réunion Météo-France office (MFR). It weakened before moving ashore in Menabe Region southwest of Morondava, and rapidly weakened over land. Fanele briefly re-intensified after reaching open waters, only to become an extratropical cyclone by January23.|$|E

North of Waddy KY 395 crosses Interstate 64 at Exit 43 and continues north across US 60. It then travels through Bagdad and ends at KY 43 roughly 5.5 miles north of Bagdad in Elmburg. The entire route is located in primarily rural sections of Anderson and Shelby counties.|$|R
5|$|Despite being {{considered}} dissipated, a re-analysis of satellite imagery indicated {{the circulation of}} Olaf persisted as turned to the west toward open waters. Early on September 30, the system reached the Pacific, and it continued westward for about a week, during which it retained some convective activity. On October 5, Olaf <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> east, as it interacted with the large circulation of developing Hurricane Pauline. Later that day, the NHC resumed issuing advisories, while it was located about 560 miles (900km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The system turned to the southeast, and, failing to organize, the NHC discontinued advisories on October 8. Three days later, after the remnants of Olaf <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> north, the NHC again resumed advisories, when it was just 70 miles (115km) south-southwest of Tecomán, Colima. Late on October 12, the circulation of Olaf made its final landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, and it quickly dissipated. An associated area of thunderstorms moved over open waters again, but failed to redevelop.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Juliette was {{the strongest}} {{hurricane}} and final tropical cyclone of the inactive 1995 Pacific hurricane season. The tenth named storm of the season, Juliette formed on September16 from a tropical wave off the southwest coast of Mexico. For {{the majority of its}} track, the storm moved toward the west-northwest, and Juliette quickly intensified to major hurricane status. On September20, the hurricane reached peak winds of 150mph (240km/h). Later it <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northeast, briefly threatening the Baja California Peninsula, although the hurricane never affected land.|$|E
5|$|On February10, MFR began {{tracking}} {{a tropical}} disturbance in the Mozambique channel near Juan de Nova Island. The system tracked generally south-southwestward, gradually intensifying. Given the name Imboa, the storm reached peak winds of 95km/h (60mph) on February13 while passing near Europa Island. After executing a small loop, Imboa <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> southeastern African coastline {{and approached the}} eastern coasts of Mozambique and South Africa as a weakened system. A ridge caused the storm {{to turn to the}} east and northeast, dissipating on February19.|$|E

5|$|The remnant low of a {{depression}} emerged into the Arabian Sea off Kerala late on November 21 and {{developed into a}} new depression the next day as it moved west. The depression moved further west, and gradually <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> southwest, intensifying as it did so. It became a cyclonic storm on November 28 to the southeast of Socotra and reached its peak with 75km/h (25mph) winds soon after. The cyclone continued to move west-southwestwards and rapidly weakened into a remnant low pressure area off the Somalia coast the next day, ending the season.|$|E
5|$|When Tropical Storm Andres first {{turned to}} the northeast, {{tropical}} storm warnings were issued from Punta Galera, Mexico to the Mexico/Guatemala border. A tropical storm warning was later issued from Champerico, Guatemala to the Mexican border. All of the warnings were dropped when Andres <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> southeast. Later, a tropical storm watch was issued for Guatemala and El Salvador, but it was quickly canceled. Due {{to the threat of}} the storm, officials closed ports along the southern Mexican coastline, and also advised for small boats to excise caution.|$|E
5|$|A {{low-pressure}} area {{developed into}} a weak tropical depression on September24 off the north coast of Honduras in the western Caribbean Sea. It was initially disorganized, without a well-developed circulation. On September25, while still a tropical depression, the system was named Debbie. Without intensifying further, the depression crossed the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula on September26. The next day, the depression <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> north in the central Gulf of Mexico before beginning a northeast motion. On September28, Debbie intensified into a tropical storm, attaining peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). This occurred after the storm developed two distinct spiral rainbands.|$|E

5|$|A weak trough {{existed in}} the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September29. A {{circulation}} developed within the storm, becoming a tropical depression on October1. Later that day, the system intensified into Tropical Storm How. Initially, the tropical storm moved west-northwestward and its sustained winds peaked by October2, estimated at 45mph (75km/h). Officials advised small boats to remain at port along the Louisiana coast due to the storm. On October3, Tropical Storm How <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> southwest as it began weakening, {{and the next day}} it moved ashore near La Pesca, Tamaulipas as a tropical depression. About six hours after making landfall, How dissipated over the Sierra Madre Oriental in northeastern Mexico. How was the only named storm in the season not to attain hurricane status.|$|E
5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to the west-southwest upon {{entering}} the basin, Evrina gradually weakened as the eye gradually dissipated. It soon encountered the same cooler waters of the southern Indian that affected previous storms Chikita and Davina. By April2, Evrina had weakened below tropical cyclone status, just 30hours after it was at peak intensity. Around that time, the circulation became exposed from the deepest convection, and the track shifted more to the west. On April5, Evrina weakened to tropical depression status. Two days later, the system <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> south, moving in a circular track around the island of Rodrigues while remaining far enough away not to cause any effects. On April8, the circulation turned to the east, dissipating two days later {{to the south of}} Rodrigues.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Hattie first posed {{a threat}} to the Yucatán Peninsula and British Honduras on October30 when it <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> area. Officials at the Miami Weather Bureau warned of the {{potential}} for high tides, strong winds, and torrential rainfall. The warnings allowed for extensive evacuations in high-risk areas. Most people in the capital, Belize City, were evacuated or moved to shelters, and a school was operated as a refuge. A hospital in the city was evacuated, and over 75% of the population of Stann Creek fled to safer locations. After Hattie made landfall, officials in Mexico ordered the closure of ports along the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.|$|E
5|$|On October 29, {{the fifth}} and final known {{tropical}} cyclone of the season developed in the western Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave. It initially moved northwestward, but <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> east shortly thereafter. Drifting due eastward, the storm grew into a minimal hurricane on October 31 while passing over the Cayman Islands. The hurricane's center passed {{just north of the}} island of Jamaica later that day as it weakened back into a tropical storm. Eventually, the storm turned abruptly northeastward and crossed the eastern tip of Cuba. By November 3, it had emerged into the Atlantic and entered the southern Bahamas. Beginning to accelerate, the tropical storm passed to the west of Bermuda before becoming extratropical on November 6.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{reaching}} peak intensity, a {{sharp increase in}} wind shear caused Emilia to weaken quickly to winds of 50mph (85km/h). Operationally, the NHC initially continued to assess the storm as with winds of 70mph (115m/h), with hurricane status predicted. However, the decrease in strength became evident on July 24, when dry air became entrained in the circulation; at the same time, the convection became limited to the southern semicircle of the storm. On July 25, the wind shear decreased as the storm <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Baja California peninsula, despite that tropical cyclones affecting the Baja California peninsula in the month of July are rare. Convection increased in coverage, and an eye feature re-appeared early on July 26 as it again attained peak winds of 65mph (105km/h).|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} slowly intensified as it traveled offshore, {{continuing to}} strengthen {{throughout the day}} on June 17, eventually reaching Category 2 status by June 18. As the storm headed northeastward, the hurricane began to weaken, becoming a tropical storm by June 21. The system <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> east-southeast on June 21, later recurving towards the east-northeast on June 22. It weakened to a tropical depression by June 23, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone later that day. Impacts caused by the hurricane were minimal—a boat was partially dismantled at Key West, and a wharf at Coconut Grove was also damaged. In addition, the schooner Hidie Feroe sank, although her crew was later rescued.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Fengshen was {{the strongest}} storm of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season. It {{developed}} on July13 from the monsoon trough near the Marshall Islands, and quickly intensified due to its small size. By July15, Fengshen attained typhoon status, and after initially moving to the north, it <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northwest. On July18, the typhoon reached its peak intensity of 185km/h (115mph 10‑minute winds), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated peak winds of 270km/h (165mph 1‑minute winds), and the agency estimated that Fengshen was a super typhoon for five days. This broke the record for longest duration at that intensity, previously set by Typhoon Joan in 1997, and which was later tied by Typhoon Ioke in 2006.|$|E
5|$|A system {{developed}} {{within a}} convergence zone on January20 near {{the boundary between}} the South-West Indian Ocean and the Australia region. Its circulation became better defined, and MFR initiated advisories on January22. With a ridge to the south, it drifted to the southeast, approaching 90°E, but turning to the southwest before crossing over. On January23, the system intensified into a tropical depression. Slowly intensifying, the depression became Tropical Storm Eddy on January24. That day, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 11S, and it <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> south. After having experienced moderate wind shear, Eddy entered an area of more favorable conditions, and its convection gradually organized. Early on January26, MFR upgraded it to a tropical cyclone, later estimating peak winds of 130km/h (80mph). After that time, increasing wind shear weakened Eddy to a tropical storm, causing it to curve to the west. By January28, the circulation was exposed from the convection, and Eddy weakened to a tropical depression. It turned to the southwest the next day, and dissipated fully on January30.|$|E
