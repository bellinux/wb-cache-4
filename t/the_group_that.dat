5|$|Gilbert surveils Watts, {{finding that}} the latter has {{been in contact with}} Means. Black travels to where Means is living, where he {{remotely}} observes a cult-like ceremony in which Means is ritually inducted into the Group. He contacts Watts, divulging the results of his tests—they were injected with a vaccine while quarantined. Black warns Watts that the Group is dangerous; Watts neither confirms nor denies this, but predicts the arrival of an earthquake, urging Black that should this prediction come to pass, he should accept full membership of <b>the</b> <b>Group.</b> <b>That</b> night, Black answers a telephone call from Means, who tells him that the Group mean no harm. The line suddenly cuts, and the tremors of an earthquake begin just as Watts had predicted. Black moves through his home, noticing that his pet bird is dead in its cage, covered in blood.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, at {{a psychic}} event in California, Ruth was {{introduced}} to Ernest Norman, who told her that in a past life {{she had been the}} daughter of an Egyptian Pharaoh and had protected Moses. Members of the organization they later established, the Unarius Academy of Science, affirm that Ernest and Ruth married on the day they met, and the group celebrates their anniversary as February14, 1954. However, Diana Tumminia of California State University, Sacramento, notes in her 2005 study of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> Ruth was probably still married to George Marian in early 1954 and speculates that their divorce was a lengthy process; Tumminia posits that Ernest and Ruth married in 1956.|$|E

5|$|Mara soon {{realized}} that his purchase of the team did not yield a home field nor any players, coaches, or equipment. Harry March, {{who was part of}} <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> convinced Mara to buy the team from the league, helped him establish the team by taking a job as the team's secretary. March guiding him through the team's early years, handling the personnel decisions. Mara rented the Polo Grounds as the team's stadium, and March developed a strategy that hinged on acquiring college stars such as Jim Thorpe. At 37years old, Thorpe was a shadow of his former self, and although he signed with the team, his contract required that he only play parts of games during the early portion of the season, until he got into shape, at which point he would play full games. He played only the first regular season game however, before ending his Giants career due to injury. His absence would severely hurt the team's monetary outlook for the season.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{examine the effect of}} {{monitoring}} and self-regulation on skill acquisition, the present study asked novice chess players to provide judgments of learning (JOLs) and to select moves for restudy after studying an endgame of chess. In four <b>groups,</b> we varied <b>the</b> JOL instruction (present versus absent) and the selection instruction (free number of move selections versus selection of at least two moves per chess exercise). After four learning trials, participants were required to play against a chess computer. In the learning phase, participants who were forced to select moves for restudy outperformed those who were free to select moves for restudy when predicting the next computer move, even after controlling for the actual number of restudied moves. Although <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> did provide JOLs showed better self-regulatory behaviour, there were no or even negative performance differences between <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> did provide JOLs and <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> did not provide JOLs. This same pattern emerged in the test phase: Although no differences were found between <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> with and without JOLs, <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> were forced to select moves for restudy outperformed <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> were free in the number of move selections. These data show that, for novice chess players, the instruction to provide JOLs possibly places a high and ineffective load on working memory and therefore has no effect on learning a chess endgame. To examine the relation between prior knowledge and quality of self-regulation, further research is needed that examines the effect of the JOL and selection instruction in <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> differ in chess experience...|$|R
5|$|One of Groves' early {{problems}} {{was to find}} a director for Project Y, <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> would design and build the bomb. The obvious choice was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, but they could not be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb design concepts. However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a Nobel Prize, which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were Communists, including his brother, Frank Oppenheimer; his wife, Kitty; and his girlfriend, Jean Tatlock. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> {{would become}} the Round Table began meeting in June 1919 {{as the result of}} a {{practical}} joke carried out by theatrical press agent John Peter Toohey. Toohey, annoyed at The New York Times drama critic Alexander Woollcott for refusing to plug one of Toohey's clients (Eugene O'Neill) in his column, organized a luncheon supposedly to welcome Woollcott back from World War I, where he had been a correspondent for Stars and Stripes. Instead Toohey used the occasion to poke fun at Woollcott on a number of fronts. Woollcott's enjoyment of the joke and the success of the event prompted Toohey to suggest that the group in attendance meet at the Algonquin each day for lunch.|$|E
