5|$|Balcon {{disliked the}} film and his initial thought was <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>its</b> running time down to an hour and {{classify}} it as a second feature. He did not provide Mackendrick with another directoral role, but assigned him to second unit work. Another of Ealing's directors, Charles Crichton, added additional footage at Ealing Studios and re-edited the film; this version was the one released into cinemas.|$|E
5|$|It {{was very}} soon after their arrival that they {{learned of the}} death of Paul I. Louis hoped that Paul's successor, Alexander I, would {{repudiate}} his father's banishment of the Bourbons (which he later did). Louis XVIII then intended to set off to the Kingdom of Naples. The Count of Artois asked Louis to send his son, Louis Antoine, and daughter-in-law, Marie-Thérèse, to him in Edinburgh, but they did not at this time. Artois had an allowance from King George III of Great Britain and sent some money to Louis. Louis XVIII's court in exile was being spied on by French police. The court-in-exile was being financed mainly by interest owed from Francis II on valuables his aunt, Marie Antoinette, had removed from France and had <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>its</b> expenses significantly.|$|E
5|$|The film's scathingly bad {{reviews and}} poor word-of-mouth {{led to a}} precipitous falling-off in its grosses. Having earned $11,548,898 from 3,307 screens on its opening weekend, its take {{collapsed}} by 67 percent to $3,924,921 the following weekend, giving an average take of $1,158 per screen. The film made 85 percent of its entire domestic gross in its first 10 days and flatlined thereafter, with earnings dropping a further 75 percent {{by the end of}} its third week to $1million. The following week, facing earnings of just $205,745, Warner Bros. attempted <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>its</b> losses by slashing the number of screens at which the film was being shown. The number was reduced from 2,587 to 641. By its sixth weekend on release, the film was showing on 95screens and had made $18,993 in a week – less than $200 per screen.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} qualify for the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), Portugal agreed <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>its</b> fiscal deficit and {{undertake}} structural reforms. The EMU brought to Portugal exchange rate stability, falling inflation, and falling interest rates.

25|$|In 2009, Tri-Rail {{service was}} nearly cut drastically, {{with the threat}} of being shut down {{altogether}} by 2011, even as ridership was at a record high, as Palm Beach County withheld its funding of the system and looked <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>its</b> funding from $4.1million to $1.6million per year. This would mean that Broward and Miami-Dade counties would also have had to cut their support to $1.6million each to match. The state, which was also running a budget shortfall and did not pass a rental car tax increase to help fund Tri-Rail, would have had <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>its</b> support as well. This would have caused an immediate cut from 50 to 30 daily trains and a complete cutting weekend service, followed by additional cuts and possible shut down two years later. Schedules were decreased slightly, but service was never cut altogether, as dedicated federal funding was attained through the $2.5million grant as part of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009.|$|E
25|$|The Ellendale Town Council {{organized}} a police {{department in the}} 1970s. Due to fiscal constraints, the department was shut down in the 1980s.

25|$|The Super League war was {{triggered}} by a vision to cut Sydney sides, with Souths in the firing line. Souths remained in the ARL during the 1997 season, and then played in the National Rugby League, the merger of the Super League and ARL, from its first season in 1998.

25|$|Heinlein got {{the idea}} for the novel {{when he and his wife}} Virginia were {{brainstorming}} one evening in 1948. She suggested a new version of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1894), but with a child raised by Martians instead of wolves. He decided to go further with the idea and worked on the story on and off for more than a decade. His editors at Putnam then required him <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>its</b> 220,000-word length down to 160,067 words before publication. In 1962, it received the Hugo Award for Best Novel.|$|E

During this period, Sears will continue selling Craftsman products royalty-free under a licensing agreement.|$|E
25|$|The IMF was {{designed}} to advance credits to countries with balance of payments deficits. Short-run balance of payment difficulties would be overcome by IMF loans, which would facilitate stable currency exchange rates. This flexibility meant a member state {{would not have to}} induce a depression <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>its</b> national income down to such a low level that its imports would finally fall within its means. Thus, countries were to be spared the need to resort to the classical medicine of deflating themselves into drastic unemployment when faced with chronic balance of payments deficits. Before the Second World War, European nations—particularly Britain—often resorted to this.|$|E

Franco decided to attack the city from the north-west in order to cut off water and {{electricity}} supplies from the Sierra de Guadarrama and encircle the city. After a failed offensive in November, the Nationalists summoned a force of 17,000 men, led by General Orgaz, with four mobile brigades (led by García Escámez , Barron, Saenz de Buruaga and Monasterio), backed by heavy artillery and Ju-52 bombers. The Republican army had a few battalions led by Luis Barceló.|$|E

In this capacity, he led his {{regiment}} in all the major campaigns from 1805 to 1807 and fought at the Battle of Dürenstein in 1805. The 103rd Line was in Honoré Theodore Maxime Gazan's division of the V Corps at Dürenstein.

Then Murat led them in an attack that defeated the Russian cavalry in the center. By this time the 2nd Cuirassier Division had become isolated after carving a path through two lines of Russian infantry. Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières now led the Guard cavalry to the rescue. After being rebuffed by the Russian second line, Grouchy's troopers joined the Horse Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard and smashed their way through. Finally, the French reserve cavalry had <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>its</b> way {{out from behind the}} Russian lines, losing between 1,000 and 1,500 troopers altogether.|$|E
25|$|Construction between Rena and Støren {{commenced}} {{during the}} fall of 1872, and by the following summer of 1873 there were 900 people working on the line. the most demanding part was through Ålen where {{a large amount of}} blasting was needed. A challenge was that {{during the fall}} harvest many people returned to the farms, with only half the men left for construction work. By March 1874 the workforce peaked at 2,100 men. That year there was a short strike, following demands for higher wages, which had been set at 1.75 kroner per day. Construction problems were the most severe in Gauldalen and Drøyliene; at the latter the Tamlaget Tunnel had to be built. Another challenge was the reliable sourcing of lumber; forest owners were often not willing to sign contracts and the railway often had <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>its</b> own timber.|$|E
