40|$|As {{multicore}} chips become ubiquitous, {{the need}} to provide architectural support for practical parallel programming is reaching critical.

A promising solution to this dilemma is transactional memory (TM). 1 With TM, programmers declare code segments that must execute atomically and in isolation from all other code. Concurrency control becomes largely the system’s responsibility, with no additional programming burden. The system monitors transactions that are executing optimistically in parallel, detects accesses to shared data that violate atomicity, and potentially aborts and reexecutes some transactions to restore atomicity.

40|$|Today, over consumption, {{pollution}} and resource depletion <b>threaten</b> sustainability. <b>Waste</b> management policies frequently fail to reduce consumption, prevent pollution, conserve resources and foster sustainable products – {{as seen in}} the context of managing end-of-life refrigerators and appliances containing ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). However, waste policies are changing to focus on lifecycle impacts of products from the cradle to the grave by extending responsibilities of stakeholders to post-consumer management. Product stewardship and extended producer responsibility are two policies in use, with radically different results when compared for one consumer product, refrigerators. North America has enacted product stewardship policies that fail to require producers to take physical or financial responsibility for recycling or for environmentally sound disposal, so that releases of ozone depleting substances routinely occur, which contribute to the expanding the ozone hole. Conversely, Europe’s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires extended producer responsibility, whereby producers collect and manage their own post-consumer waste products. WEEE has resulted in high recycling rates of greater than 85 %, reduced emissions of ODSs and other toxins, greener production methods, such as replacing greenhouse gas refrigerants with environmentally friendly hydrocarbons and more reuse of refrigerators in EU compared to North America.

The study employed a range of methods including content analyses of policies and legislation, audits of waste arisings, field visits, stakeholder interviews and evaluation of treatment systems. The study estimated a production from clinics and hospitals of 683 kg/day of hazardous waste in the Gaza Strip, while the total health-care waste production was 3357  kg/day. A number of challenges was identified including lack of clear definitions and regulations, limited accurate data on which to base decisions and strategies and poor coordination amongst key stakeholders. Hazardous and non-hazardous waste was partially segregated and treatment facilities hardly used, and 75 % of the hazardous waste was left untreated. Recommendations for mitigating these challenges posed to patients, staff and the community in general are suggested. The outputs are particularly useful to support decision makers, and re-organize the system according to reliable data and sound assumptions. The methodology can be replicated in other humanitarian settings, also to other waste flows, and other sectors of environmental sanitation...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Over {{the last}} few years, the rising level of the Great Salt Lake has changed Utah. It has {{inundated}} vast waterfowl feeding areas, crippled the salt industry, required raising transcontinental freeways and railroads, <b>threatened</b> metropolitan <b>waste</b> treatment plants, caused a major electrical outage, and damaged many properties. If nothing is done, approximately $ 3. 6 billion of damages in 1985 dollars can be expected by 2050 (James et al, 1985, p. 4). This threat led the State Legislature to set aside $ 100 million (an amount approximating the damages that had then occurred) in January 1985 to identify, select, and implement remedial measures. The rise has slowed. However, the lake entered February 1986 at its highest level since 1877, and a large storm of tripical origins brought a record one-month rise, tying the high of the previous spring at 4209. 95, with heavy snowpacks {{in the mountains and}} at least three months of precipitation left before the normal date of the annual peak. Nevertheless, the legislature is diverting some of the funds to other purposes. As shown in Figure 2, the rise has greatly enlarged the surface area of a shallow water body. Table 1 shows how the historic variation has increased the lake surface area from 587, 000 to 1, 556, 0000 acres, a range that varies normal annual evaporation from 1, 470, 000 to 4, 800, 000 acre feet. The lake will rise as long as inflow exceed actual evaporation. Total inflows were 5, 300, 000 acre feet in 1983, 6, 200, 000 acre feet in 1984, and 3, 800, 000 acre feet in 1985.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to study and predict the {{self-purification}} capacity of River Atuwara. This was done primarily by measuring the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) downstream of a pre-selected pollution discharge point on River Atuwara and then predicting the same using the modified Streeter-Phelps equations. Other data gathered from each of the 17 sampling stations on River Atuwara and used in the analysis included Biochemical Oxygen Demand, (BOD), pH, stream velocity, stream depth and distance. Predicted DO deficit trend lines were first fitted by retaining the original re-aeration coefficient component, k 2, of the modified Streeter-Phelps equation (USGS equation) and subsequently by substituting it with Atuwara reaeration coefficient model. It was found that the latter displayed better predictive capacity. Results also demonstrated that the auto-purification capacity of the river which is already limited by the relatively low DO saturation level is further <b>threatened</b> by the <b>wastes</b> being discharged into it at varying intervals. Some of the wastes which are non-biodegradable and acidic were also found to be interrupting the auto-purification processes of the river.

40|$|Abstract: During {{the last}} decades, in most {{industry}} countries, {{a large number}} of old buildings has been demolished and million tons of construction demolition waste have been produced. Demolition waste around the cities not only is a serious threat to the environment and underground water sanitation, but results in unpleasant landscapes. At present approximately 5 % of bricks taken from demolition sites are being separated and recycled, while the proportion of concrete being recycled is up around 90 %. This low rate of brick recycling is {{due to a lack of}} research into the performance of crushed brick material in applications such as concrete aggregate and road base. On the other hand, the low quality of crushed brick such as high water absorption and low strength in comparison with rock makes it difficult to meet concrete specifications. The importance of recycling brick cannot be overemphasized, since clinker bricks make up a large portion of construction and demolition waste. Considering the environmental impacts, construction and demolition <b>waste</b> <b>threatens</b> the health and safety of large and developed cities. The investigations showed that, when properly organized, masonry clay bricks could be crushed, sieved and used as economically as aggregate to produce concrete products.
