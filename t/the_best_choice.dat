5|$|A CRA poll {{conducted}} throughout May 2013 continued to show declining support for Dunderdale, her government, and the PC Party. Only 21 per cent {{of those surveyed}} felt Dunderdale was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>choice</b> for premier, behind both Michael and Ball. Dissatisfaction with her government increased to 65 per cent, compared to 33 per cent who indicated they were dissatisfied a year earlier. Support for the Progressive Conservatives also fell to just 27 per cent. This was below both the NDP and Liberals who were statistically tied for first, at 37 per cent and 36 per cent respectively. The poll also showed that 35 per cent of respondents were undecided or did not plan to vote, a significant increase from 14 per cent in November 2011. Towards the end of 2013, satisfaction for the Dunderdale administration saw a significant increase, though support for her and the PC Party saw little change from the poll in May. According to a November CRA poll, satisfaction with the Dunderdale government was up 10 points from May to 42 per cent, while dissatisfaction was at 52 per cent. A quarter of decided voters thought Dundedale was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>choice</b> for premier, this was above Michael but 14 points below Ball. Due to a large drop in NDP support, down to 19 percent, the PC Party moved back into second place with 29 per cent of decided voters indicating that {{they would vote for}} the party in an election. The Liberal Party opened up a wide lead with 52 per cent of decided voters saying they would vote for the party in an election.|$|E

Mowry considered the character to be her first adult role and felt it emphasized her individuality and maturity.

She cited The Game as an example of women receiving more lead roles on television.|$|E
5|$|After {{three months}} of {{inactivity}} and regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to begin fighting again. The target chosen for the first attack was {{the northern city of}} Ruhengeri, which lies immediately south of the Virunga mountains. The city was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>choice</b> from a practical point of view, being the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise. Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, as well as his wife and her powerful family, came from the north west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region was as the heartland of the regime. An attack there guaranteed that the population would become aware of the RPF's presence, and Kagame hoped the attack would destabilise the government.|$|E

Ardolino had never directed a feature film, but was extremely passionate about the project; he even sent a message {{from where he was}} sequestered on jury duty, insisting that he was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>choice</b> as director. The team of Gottlieb, Bergstein, and Ardolino then presented their vision for the film to Vestron's president, Jon Peisinger, and the company's vice president for production, Mitchell Cannold. By the end of the meeting, Peisinger had greenlighted the project to become Vestron's first feature film production.

According to Hodder, New Line failed to provide him with a reason for the recasting, but Yu has explained he wanted a slower, more deliberate Jason, and less of the aggressive movements that Hodder had used in the previous films.

Eventually, the band decided Rubin would be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>choice</b> as a producer, and therefore hired him to produce what would become Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone that they felt confident to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty.

5|$|The Anglo-Norman was {{developed}} in the early 19th century, and along with Thoroughbred and local Norman blood, influences were seen from other breeds, including British and Russian trotting horses. By the mid-19th century, the Anglo-Norman was a popular breed throughout France, and in 1864 a breed association was founded. While often purchased by the French army and used as cavalry and artillery horses, there was controversy over whether the Anglo-Norman was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>choice</b> for the military. The late 19th century saw significant improvements in breeding programs, although there remained a dispute between the goals of breeders and the needs of the military. Mechanization in the early 20th century significantly reduced demand for the breed, and fighting during World War II and the German occupation of France resulted in major damage to breeding centers and the deaths of many horses. While rebuilding their herds, breeders turned away from draft and carriage horses and began breeding sport horses for equestrian competition.|$|E
5|$|Ziskin {{initially}} considered hiring Buck Henry {{to write}} the adaptation, finding Fight Club similar to the 1967 film The Graduate, which Henry had adapted.

He considered Peter Jackson <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>choice,</b> but Jackson was too busy filming the 1996 film The Frighteners in New Zealand. Bryan Singer received the book but did not read it. Danny Boyle met with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. David Fincher, who had read Fight Club and had tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. He hesitated to accept the assignment with 20th Century Fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 film Alien 3 for the studio.

5|$|By {{the time}} the provincial {{election}} was called in September 2011, support for Dunderdale, her government and the Progressive Conservatives had fallen in public opinion polls. However, her party entered the campaign with support levels in the high fifties and Dunderdale remained the top choice for premier. On October 11, 2011, Dunderdale led her party to victory winning 56 per cent of the popular vote, which was consistent with polling throughout the campaign. After an initial bounce in the polls following the election, support for Dunderdale would decline right up until her resignation as premier in 2014. Throughout 2012, Dunderdale saw her personal numbers take a big hit, while PC Party support and government satisfaction would also decline. In November 2012, 36 per cent of respondents to a CRA poll thought Dunderdale was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>choice</b> for premier, down from 59 per cent a year earlier. Although the Progressive Conservatives still remained in first place their support had fallen 14 points over the year to 46 per cent. While government satisfaction had fallen it remained high, with 58 percent of respondents either being completely or mostly satisfied. An Angus Reid poll released in December 2012, also showed declining support for Dunderdale over the year. Just 37 per cent of those polled approved of the job Dunderdale was doing as premier, while 55 per cent disapproved.|$|E
