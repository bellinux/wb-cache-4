It was revived in 1863 for a Russian ballerina, then dropped again in 1868. It was revived almost 50 years later in 1924 for the debut of Olga Spessivtzeva. This production was revived in 1932 and 1938.|$|E
5|$|Alkan's {{compositions}} for organ {{have been}} among the last of his works to be brought back to <b>the</b> <b>repertoire.</b> As to Alkan's pedal-piano works, due to a recent revival of the instrument, they are once again being performed as originally intended (rather than on an organ), such as by Italian pedal-pianist Roberto Prosseda, and recordings of Alkan on the pedal piano have been made by Jean Dubé and Olivier Latry.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his death}} (which {{according}} to persistent but unfounded legend {{was caused by}} a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected, supported by only a few musicians including Ferruccio Busoni, Egon Petri and Kaikhosru Sorabji.

5|$|In {{the years}} since its American premiere The Bartered Bride has entered the {{repertory}} of all major opera companies, and is regularly revived worldwide.

40|$|Although {{there is}} an {{increasing}} body {{of research on the}} formation/re-formation of language teacher identity, there are still contexts within the professional p ractice of language teachers that remain relatively unexplored. One such context is the oral examination situation undergone by language teachers in Poland as part of the procedure for professional promotion. During this examination, teachers are expected to present their work, taking the prescribed ministerial regulations as their reference point. As access to teacher identity can be obtained through teacher talk about themselves, the presentations can be treated as teacher-made identity texts. Drawing on the 3 A (affiliation, attachment, autonomy) Language Teacher Identity Framework (3 ALTIF), this qualitative study focuses on the narratives of 15 examinees, all of whom are in-service English teachers, with a view to discovering: (a) what interpretative <b>repertoires</b> <b>the</b> participants employ with regard to conceptualizations of the language teaching profession (affiliation) which, in turn, determine (b) how they conceptualize themselves as language teacher practitioners with regard to their repertoires (attachment), and (c) how they express their agency through canonical self-presentations and responses to examiners’ questions within the framework of their repertoires (autonomy). Based on the analysis of the study, five interpretative <b>repertoires</b> were identified: <b>the</b> examination-orientation <b>repertoire,</b> <b>the</b> self-positioning <b>repertoire,</b> <b>the</b> care-forothers <b>repertoire,</b> <b>the</b> change <b>repertoire,</b> and <b>the</b> making-a-difference <b>repertoire.</b> <b>The</b> obtained <b>repertoires</b> can be ‘read’ as the participants’ self-evaluations with regard to their perceived teacher roles and the ability to express themselves...|$|R

5|$|Meyerbeer's costly operas, {{requiring}} grand casts {{of leading}} singers, were gradually dropped from <b>the</b> <b>repertoire</b> {{in the early}} 20th century.

30|$|The {{characteristics}} of <b>the</b> TRA <b>repertoire</b> {{are similar to}} those of <b>the</b> TRB <b>repertoire,</b> indicating that both TRA and TRB experienced similar rearrangement processes regulated by recombination or selection mechanisms. Though <b>the</b> TRA <b>repertoire</b> was estimated to be less diversified than <b>the</b> TCRβ <b>repertoire</b> in whole blood (Arstila et al., 1999), we observed a higher diversity in <b>the</b> TRA <b>repertoire</b> than in <b>the</b> TRB <b>repertoire</b> within <b>the</b> sampled 50 mL PBMCs for any given donor (Table  1). This is consistent with the fact that during the period of 5 days between TRB and TRA rearrangement in the thymus, T cell proliferation results in a 1000 -fold expansion, i.e., ~ 1000 different TRAs may pair with one unique TCRβ (Arstila et al., 1999). Furthermore, dual TCRs caused by less stringent allelic exclusion of the TCRα may also contribute to the TRA-to-TRB pairing (Borgulya et al., 1992; Padovan et al., 1993).|$|R

5|$|Before {{pre-production}} began, songwriters Mike Stoller and Jerry Leiber {{were commissioned}} {{to integrate the}} film's soundtrack.

Presley recorded the soundtrack at Radio Recorders in Hollywood on April 30 and May 3, with an additional session at the MGM Soundstage on May 9. During post-production, the songs were dubbed into the films scenes, in which Presley mimed the lyrics.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, Shakespeare became {{associated}} with rising British nationalism, and Boydell tapped {{into the same}} mood that many other entrepreneurs were exploiting. Shakespeare appealed not only to a social elite who prided themselves on their artistic taste, {{but also to the}} emerging middle class who saw in Shakespeare's works a vision of a diversified society. The mid-century Shakespearean theatrical revival was probably most responsible for reintroducing the British public to Shakespeare. Shakespeare's plays were integral to the theatre's resurgence at this time. Despite the upsurge in theatre-going, writing tragedies was not profitable, and thus few good tragedies were written. Shakespeare's works filled the gap in <b>the</b> <b>repertoire,</b> and his reputation grew as a result. By the end of the 18th century, one out of every six plays performed in London was by Shakespeare.|$|E

5|$|Several {{types of}} cricket songs are in <b>the</b> <b>repertoire</b> of some species. The calling song attracts females and repels other males, and is fairly loud.

A triumphal song is produced {{for a brief period}} after a successful mating, and may reinforce the mating bond to encourage the female to lay some eggs rather than find another male. An aggressive song is triggered by contact chemoreceptors on the antennae that detect the presence of another male cricket.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} {{period for}} Giselle is not {{indicated in the}} story. Paul Lormier, the chief costume designer at the Paris Opéra, probably consulted Gautier on this matter.

These costumes were said to have been those from Rossini's William Tell (1829) and Berlioz's Benvenuto Cellini (1838). Lormier certainly designed the costumes for the principal characters.
