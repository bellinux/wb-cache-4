5|$|Some jumping spiders' {{visual acuity}} exceeds {{by a factor}} of ten that of dragonflies, which have by far the best vision among insects; in fact the human eye is only about five times sharper than a jumping spider's. They achieve this by a telephoto-like series of lenses, a four-layer retina and the ability to swivel their eyes and {{integrate}} images from different stages in the scan. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that the scanning and integrating processes are relatively slow.|$|E
25|$|Most hobs are single-thread hobs, but double-, and triple-thread hobs {{increase}} production rates. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> {{that they are}} not as accurate as single-thread hobs.|$|E
25|$|Again, {{with every}} doubling, <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> the {{increased}} latency. As with all DDR SDRAM generations, commands are still restricted to one clock edge and command latencies {{are given in}} terms of clock cycles, which are half {{the speed of the}} usually quoted transfer rate (a CAS latency of 8 with DDR3-800 is 8/(400MHz) = 20 ns, exactly the same latency of CAS2 on PC100 SDR SDRAM).|$|E
50|$|The Blower Bentley was born, more {{powerful}} than the 6½ Litre despite lacking the two additional cylinders. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> that Blower Bentleys consumed 4 litres of fuel per minute at full speed.|$|R
50|$|A V8 {{engine in}} the {{lightweight}} vehicle meant impressive performance for a truck. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> gruesome fuel consumption and from 1964 onwards the Snabbe was offered with a diesel engine as an alternative.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Bentley Blower" [...] was born, more {{powerful}} than the 6½ Litre despite lacking the two additional cylinders. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> that Blower Bentleys consume 4 liters of fuel per minute at full speed.|$|R
25|$|Riggers jump in to {{machines}} {{to control them}} with their mind. While jumped in {{they feel like they}} are the machine, using the vehicle or drone's sensors to replace their own. This allows the rigger to control the machine at Matrix speeds and with greater precision. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> if the machine takes damage the rigger {{will have to deal with}} dangerous levels of biofeedback. Likewise the rigger may have to engage in cybercombat with other hackers that are attempting to hijack their devices.|$|E
25|$|An {{adiabatic}} {{storage system}} does {{away with the}} intercooling during the compression process, and simply allows the gas to heat up during compression, and likewise to cool down during expansion. This is attractive, since the energy losses associated with the heat transfer are avoided, but <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that the storage vessel must be insulated against heat loss. It should also be mentioned that real compressors and turbines are not isentropic, but instead have an isentropic efficiency of around 85%, {{with the result that}} round-trip storage efficiency for adiabatic systems is also considerably less than perfect.|$|E
25|$|Pelagic spawners: {{a type of}} {{broadcast}} spawners, spawn in the open sea, mostly near the surface. They are usually pelagic fish such as tuna and sardines. Some demersal fish leave the bottom to spawn pelagically, particularly coral reef fish such as parrotfish and wrasses. Pelagic spawning means water currents widely disperse the young. The eggs, embryos and larvae of pelagic spawners contain oil globules or have a high water content. As a result, they are buoyant and are widely dispersed by currents. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that mortality is high, {{because they can be}} eaten so easily by pelagic predators or they can drift into unsuitable areas. Females compensate by spawning large numbers of eggs and extending their spawning periods. Pelagic spawners that live in or around coral reefs can spawn a small number of eggs almost daily over a period of months. These fishes have complex breeding behaviours including sex changes, harems, leks and territoriality. See also: Coral reef fish.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> that textures may {{not appear}} as sharp {{if they are}} {{included}} in the edge detection, and it must be applied before rendering the HUD elements of a game, lest it affect them too.|$|R
50|$|The Smith Carbine {{was unique}} in that it broke apart in the middle for loading and it used rubber {{cartridges}} which sealed the gases in <b>the</b> breech. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> that these cartridges were difficult to remove.|$|R
50|$|The Philadelphia Flyers {{become the}} first team to wear long pants. The idea was to create a more {{streamlined}} uniform with lighter padding, thus making the players faster. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> that <b>the</b> players hit the boards faster after being bodychecked.|$|R
500|$|Francis Iles, {{writing in}} The Guardian, noting the short-story format, [...] "thought {{it better than}} the novels" [...] and wrote that [...] "the first story is full of the old wild improbabilities, {{but one of the}} others has a {{positively}} Maughamish flavour." [...] Iles also thought that [...] "it seems that one must either enjoy the novels of Mr. Ian Fleming beyond reason or be unable to read them at all." [...] Writing in The Guardians sister paper, The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that [...] "our Casanovaesque cad-clubman secret agent is mellowing a bit now"; Richardson liked the format, saying that [...] "the short form suits him quite well" [...] although <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that [...] "if it checks the wilder fantasies it cuts short the love-affairs". Writing in The Spectator, Cyril Ray (under the pseudonym Christopher Pym) wrote that [...] "each episode of the Bond novels meant the adventure was less probable and more preposterous than the last, and now our hero seems to have lost, as well as any claims to plausibility, the know-how, the know-who, know-what and sheer zing that used to carry the unlikely plots along. Perhaps all that mattress pounding is taking it out of poor Bond".|$|E
2500|$|There is no flash {{produced}} so material {{savings are}} between 20 and 30% over conventional forging. The final product is a consistent [...] so air cooling {{will result in}} a part that is still easily machinable (the advantage being the lack of annealing required after forging). Tolerances are usually ±, surfaces are clean, and draft angles are 0.5 to 1°. Tool life is nearly double that of conventional forging because contact times are on the order of 0.06-second. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that this process is only feasible on smaller symmetric parts and cost; the initial investment can be over $10 million, so large quantities are required to justify this process.|$|E
2500|$|Multi-choice procedure. [...] A softer option, {{when the}} parties {{do not wish}} to commit {{themselves}} to a more dramatic termination procedure, the deadlock can often provide for a series of options, one of which the parties must agree on, if the deadlock cannot be resolved. [...] The benefit of an open textured clause like this is that, when faced with the draconian consequences of the next step, the parties are thought to be better able to compromise. [...] <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that if the parties are truly at loggerheads, it usually requires a third party adjudicator (often an arbitrator) to impose one of the options upon them.|$|E
50|$|Lazy copy {{looks to}} the outside just as a deep copy, but takes {{advantage}} of the speed of a shallow copy whenever possible. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>are</b> rather high but constant base costs because of the counter. Also, in certain situations, circular references can cause problems.|$|R
5000|$|A {{complete}} emulator {{provides a}} simulation of {{all aspects of}} the hardware, allowing all of it to be controlled and modified, and allowing debugging on a normal PC. <b>The</b> <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> expense and slow operation, in some cases up to 100 times slower than the final system.|$|R
25|$|While this {{machinery}} {{would prove}} capable of outperforming <b>the</b> opposition, <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> economy of operation. Fuel consumption for Baltic reached between 75 and 85 tons of coal per day, {{more than twice}} as much as the 35 to 45 tons a day for her Cunard Line competitors.|$|R
2500|$|The exact {{choice of}} engine systems remains {{somewhat}} controversial at this point. The concept was originally for an integrated power system (IPS) based on in-hull permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMMs), with Advanced Induction Motors (AIM) {{as a possible}} backup solution. The design was shifted to the AIM system in February 2005 {{in order to meet}} scheduled milestones; PMM technical issues were subsequently fixed, but the program has moved on. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that AIM technology has a heavier motor, requires more space, requires a [...] "separate controller" [...] to be developed to meet noise requirements, and produces one-third the amount of voltage. On the other hand, these very differences will force time and cost penalties from design and construction changes if the program wishes to [...] "design AIM out" [...] … ...|$|E
2500|$|Albuquerque has {{expanded}} greatly in area since the mid-1940s. During {{those years of}} expansion, the planning of the newer areas has considered that people drive rather than walk. The pre-1940s parts of Albuquerque are quite different in style and scale from the post 1940s areas. These older areas include the North Valley, the South Valley, various neighborhoods near downtown, and Corrales. The newer areas generally feature four to six lane roads in a 1mile(1.61km) grid. Each 1square mile(2.59km²) is divided into four [...] neighborhoods by smaller roads set 0.5miles(0.8km) between major roads. When driving along major roads in the newer sections of Albuquerque, one sees strip malls, signs, and cinderblock walls. The upside of this planning style is that neighborhoods are shielded from {{the worst of the}} noise and lights on the major roads. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that {{it is virtually impossible to}} go anywhere from home without driving.|$|E
2500|$|XM also {{provided}} data {{services such as}} weather information for pilots and weather spotters through its Sirius XM Weather & Emergency datacasting service. This up to the minute weather information could be displayed in the cockpit of an aircraft equipped with a satellite weather receiver. Unlike weather radar, which relies on the aircraft's own equipment, the satellite service could give a pilot information about weather anywhere in USA and Canada. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that the various weather streams (radar, cloud coverage, lightning, forecast, TAF, FA, etc...) took around 15 minutes to complete the data download, meaning that the information can be somewhat out-of-date {{by the time it}} is shown. In-cockpit radar and lightning receivers returned truly realtime information, but they cost thousands of dollars, did not provide forecasts, nor did they provide complete weather reports. FAA Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) were also available and shown. [...] Certain aircraft had the XM radio service provided to the aircraft's audio system, which allowed passengers to listen to XM radio while flying.|$|E
50|$|In {{its first}} appearance, Krypton was only {{depicted}} {{at the moment}} of its destruction. Soon, beginning in the Superman comic strip, Krypton was shown to have been a planet similar to Earth, only older by eons and possessed of all the beneficial progress that implied (though <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> hint that Krypton exploded due mainly to old age).|$|R
50|$|While setup {{costs are}} high, once ready to produce, {{injection}} molding produces stocks {{for less than}} the cost of the cheapest wood stocks. Every stock is virtually identical in dimension, and requires no bedding, inletting, or finishing. <b>The</b> <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> a lack of rigidity and thermal stability, which are side effects of the thermoplastic materials used for injection molding.|$|R
50|$|Baylor University had {{substantial}} land {{to offer}} {{on the banks}} of the Brazos River in Waco. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fact that Baylor is not in a major metropolitan area and would probably not attract nearly as many visitors annually as the library would if it were built somewhere in the Dallas area. Many Baylor students and faculty were supportive of the bid.|$|R
2500|$|Arriving at the Boarding House of Mystery, Howard and Beverly {{encounter}} Cain and Abel, {{the latter}} {{with a rock}} stuck in his head that allows him only moments of lucidity. [...] There, they are granted their every wish, including Howard's return to his true form, and Beverly never being tight again, and meet parodies of John Constantine, Wesley Dodds, The Endless, Spider Jerusalem, and Gerber's own Nevada (called Utah), all characters from DC Comics' Vertigo imprint. [...] <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that everyone staying in the place gets their every wish, so Che Guevara can have his revolution, but someone else can easily slaughter him. One tenant, a writer named Mr. Gommorah (a parody of Spider Jerusalem), takes Beverly and Howard {{to be on the}} Iprah Show with the topic [...] "Why Women Give It to Men Who Don't Get It", guest starring Dr. Phlip. [...] Upon leaving the house, Howard is once again transformed into a mouse. [...] Iprah has been merged with an experiment by the Angel Gabriel called Deuteronomy, intended to replace God, because God has been spending all his time in a bar in Hell since 1938. [...] Deuteronomy is a creature half id and half superego, while Iprah is an all-ego promoter of self-indulgent pop psychology. [...] Considering her dangerous, Gabriel sends the cherub Thrasher to resurrect Sigmund Freud, whose cigar blasts out half of Thrasher's brains (being immortal, this just makes him act drunk). [...] Iprah destroys Freud, but Howard blasts her with the cigar, separating her from Deuteronomy. [...] Puffing on the cigar, Howard disintegrates and arrives in Hell. He is eventually freed by Yah, a being who claims to be [...] "God". A few years later he was reunited with his parents and brother at a baseball game in Dakvorlde.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> the {{advanced}} {{erosion of the}} beach, some resorts meanwhile lack a beach at high tide, when the water directly reaches the sea wall.|$|E
50|$|Competitive {{swimming}} wetsuits {{are made}} of the most expanded foam; {{they have to be}} very flexible to allow the swimmer unrestricted movement. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that they are quite fragile.|$|E
5000|$|On <b>the</b> <b>downside,</b> BLAST <b>was</b> {{criticized by}} XMODEM {{developer}} Chuck Forsberg {{because of its}} proprietary nature, making it [...] "tightly bound to the fortunes of supplier".|$|R
50|$|Android Central's Andrew Martonik {{likes the}} Shield Tablet, praising its {{speakers}} and the Twitch streaming ability. <b>The</b> <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> that <b>the</b> tablet is heavier than its competitor (390g to the Nexus 7's 290g) {{and it may}} be too expensive for some (the tablet is $299 to $399, the controller is $59, and the cover is $39). The Shield Tablet K1 released in late 2015 comes without a charger or stylus.|$|R
50|$|These {{batteries}} {{could allow}} electric cars to travel 500 miles before recharging. Replacing the liquid electrodes could {{only take a}} few minutes while recharging batteries takes much longer. These batteries don't have the problems of short circuits and overheating. <b>The</b> <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> that nanoparticles degrade quickly, the technology is new and needs more development, they need to focus on cheaper production, and refilling stations would cost a lot to build.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> the {{logistical}} [...] "tail," [...] {{which means}} {{it takes a while}} to get parts. Further, the ship is software dependent, which is an independent source of failure.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} {{listener}} only knows the intended recipient from {{the context of}} the conversation. Requires moderate signal quality for the radio operator {{to keep track of the}} conversations.|$|E
50|$|However <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} staff at Review Centre {{do not appear to}} take {{negative}} reviews or their potential effects on businesses very seriously which leaves the system open to abuse.|$|E
25|$|An {{invitation}} for tenders was issued in 1947. Ateliers de Constructions Electriques de Charleroi offered to build a European adoption of the PCC streetcar, although the necessary licenses for Scandinavia were held by Svenska Järnvägsverkstäderna. The trams met all of Oslo Sporveier's demands, except their high power usage. However, <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> high price and that foreign production would require currency exchange licenses, which could be complicated because part of the price was for royalties.|$|R
50|$|OTPs {{have been}} {{discussed}} as a possible replacement for, as well as enhancer to, traditional passwords. On <b>the</b> <b>downside,</b> OTPs <b>are</b> difficult for human beings to memorize. Therefore, they require additional technology to work.|$|R
5|$|Describing {{the choice}} of {{developing}} a game based on the existing White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky said that although an original property lacked the constraints of an existing one, <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> {{that it had not}} been tested and could be rejected by its potential audience; an existing property was proven. Troika tried to stay {{as close as possible to}} the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to Bloodlines gameplay.|$|R
