2500|$|The Miracle at the Meadowlands is {{the term}} used by sportscasters and Philadelphia Eagles fans for a fumble {{recovery}} by cornerback Herman Edwards that he returned for a touchdown {{at the end of}} a November 19, 1978, NFL game against the New York Giants in Giants Stadium. It is considered miraculous because the Giants were ahead and could easily have run out the final seconds; they had the ball and the Eagles had no timeouts left. Everyone watching expected quarterback Joe Pisarcik <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> snap and kneel with the ball, thus running out the clock and preserving a 17–12 Giants upset. Instead, he botched an attempt to hand off the football to fullback Larry Csonka. Edwards [...] picked up the dropped ball and ran 26 yards for the winning score.|$|E
2500|$|On the field, the Expos won {{just four}} games {{more than they}} lost between 1986 and 1991 as the {{organization}} set about rebuilding its development system and acquiring {{a new generation of}} players. The team struggled to attract free agents to Montreal, and Bronfman had grown disillusioned with both the business of baseball and the challenge of drawing fans to Olympic Stadium for a middling ball club. He hoped <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> chance at winning a title, however, and in , the Expos made a push for a division title by acquiring start pitcher and pending free agent Mark Langston from the Seattle Mariners. [...] The price would ultimately prove to be a high one as the Expos gave up future Hall of Famer Randy Johnson and two other pitchers. The trade helped propel the Expos to first place in the NL East by the All-Star break. They held the top spot into August before Langston and the team collapsed. [...] The Expos finished fourth in the division with an 81–81 record, and Langston left Montreal as a free agent.|$|E

I did not think a guide necessary, but a boy took me up by a track near Gadmen, and left me to my Siegfried map some way up the great ridge of rocks that overlooks the Engstlen Alp. I a little overestimated my mountaineering, and it came about that I was benighted while I was still high above the Joch Pass on my descent. Some of this was steep and needed caution. I had to come down slowly with my folding lantern, in which a reluctant candle went out at regular intervals, and I did not reach the little inn at Engstlen Alp until long after eleven at night. By that time I was very tired and hungry.|$|E

60|$|This was {{the last}} {{battlefield}} on which Molly Pitcher appeared, but {{it had not been}} her first. Not long before, she had been with her husband in Fort Clinton when it was attacked by a very large force of the British. After a vigorous defense, the Americans found {{that it was impossible to}} defend the fort, and a retreat was ordered. As the soldiers were rushing out of the rear of the fort, Molly's husband turned away from his gun, threw down his match,--a piece of rope soaked in combustible substances, and slowly burning at one end, which was used in those days for discharging cannon,--and ran for his life. Molly prepared to follow him; but as she saw the glowing match on the ground, and knew that her husband's gun was loaded, she could not resist the desire <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> crack at the enemy. So she stopped for an instant, picked up the match, touched off the gun, and dashed away after her husband. The cannon which then blazed out in the face of the advancing British {{was the last}} gun which the Americans fired in Fort Clinton.|$|E
60|$|For a {{few minutes}} after he reached the deck, Mark was fully {{employed}} in executing his orders. Sail was shortened with great rapidity, the men working with zeal and alarm, for they believed their messmate when the captain had not. Although the vessel was under top-mast studding-sails when the command to take in the canvas was given, it was not long before Mark had her under her three topsails, and these with two reefs in them, and the ship on an easy bowline, with her head to the southward. When all this was done the young man felt a good deal of relief, for the danger he had seen was ahead, and this change of course brought it nearly abeam. It is true, the breakers were still to leeward, and insomuch most dangerously situated but the wind did not blow strong enough to prevent the ship from weathering them, provided time was taken by the forelock. The Rancocus was a good, weatherly ship, nor was there sufficient sea on to make it at all difficult for her to claw off a lee shore. Desperate indeed is the situation of the vessel that has rocks or sands under her lee, with the gale blowing in her teeth, and heavy seas sending her bodily, and surely, however slowly, on the very breakers she is struggling to avoid! Captain Crutchely had not been aloft five minutes before he hailed the deck, and ordered Mark to send Bob Betts up to the cross-trees. Bob had the reputation of being the brightest look-out in the vessel, and was usually employed when land was about to be approached, or a sail was expected to be made. He went up the fore-rigging like a squirrel, and was soon at the captain's side, both looking anxiously to leeward. A few minutes after the ship had hauled by the wind, both came down, stopping in the top, however, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> look to leeward.|$|E

50|$|The game {{starts off}} with two ships in reserve and three cluster bombs. The {{spaceship}} moves left-to-right, with the screen being at rest only at certain areas, such as boss battles. During enemy barrages, supply ships will periodically enter the screen {{near the top}} or bottom and, if shot, will release upgrades. Multiple pickups of the same color/upgrade will increase the potency of the weapon {{to a maximum of}} three levels, and allow the ship <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> extra hit per pickup to a maximum of three hits; with each hit, the ship will lose one level of weapon increase and will be destroyed if the ship is hit at a base weapon level.
