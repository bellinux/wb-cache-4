5|$|Acurad was a {{die casting}} process {{developed}} by General Motors {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, and dense. It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional solidification with the fast cycle times of the traditional die casting process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: <b>thermal</b> <b>analysis,</b> flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die castings, and indirect squeeze casting (explained below).|$|E
5|$|The <b>thermal</b> <b>analysis</b> was {{the first}} done for any casting process. This was done by {{creating}} an electrical analog of the thermal system. A cross-section of the dies were drawn on Teledeltos paper and then thermal loads and cooling patterns were drawn onto the paper. Water lines were represented by magnets of various sizes. The thermal conductivity was represented by the reciprocal of the resistivity of the paper.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} {{is widely used}} {{across a range of}} applications, both as a routine quality test and as a research tool. The equipment is easy to calibrate, using low melting indium at 156.5985 °C for example, and is a rapid and reliable method of <b>thermal</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} technique, which shares much {{in common}} with DSC, is differential <b>thermal</b> <b>analysis</b> (DTA). In this technique it is the heat flow to the sample and reference that remains the same rather than the temperature. When the sample and reference are heated identically, phase changes and other thermal processes cause a difference in temperature between the sample and reference. Both DSC and DTA provide similar information. DSC measures the energy required to keep both the reference and the sample at the same temperature whereas DTA measures the difference in temperature between the sample and the reference when the same amount of energy has been introduced into both.|$|E
2500|$|DSC is used widely for {{examining}} polymeric materials {{to determine their}} thermal transitions. [...] The observed thermal transitions can be utilized to compare materials, although the transitions do not uniquely identify composition. The composition of unknown materials may be completed using complementary techniques such as IR spectroscopy. [...] Melting points and glass transition temperatures for most polymers are available from standard compilations, and the method can show polymer degradation by the lowering of the expected melting point, Tm, for example. Tm depends on the molecular weight of the polymer and thermal history, so lower grades may have lower melting points than expected. The percent crystalline content of a polymer can be estimated from the crystallization/melting peaks of the DSC graph as reference heats of fusion {{can be found in}} the literature. DSC can also be used to study thermal degradation of polymers using an approach such as Oxidative Onset Temperature/Time (OOT), however, the user risks contamination of the DSC cell, which can be problematic. [...] Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) may be more useful for decomposition behavior determination. [...] Impurities in polymers can be determined by examining thermograms for anomalous peaks, and plasticisers can be detected at their characteristic boiling points. [...] In addition, examination of minor events in first heat <b>thermal</b> <b>analysis</b> data can be useful as these apparently [...] "anomalous peaks" [...] can in fact also be representative of process or storage thermal history of the material or polymer physical aging. Comparison of first and second heat data collected at consistent heating rates can allow the analyst to learn about both polymer processing history and material properties.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There are {{two ways}} of {{conventional}} <b>thermal</b> distortion <b>analysis.</b> One is <b>thermal</b> elasto-plastic <b>analysis</b> {{and the other is}} equivalent forces method based on inherent strain. The former needs exorbitant analysis time, while the latter cannot obtain stress results and requires more time with loads modeling on curved plates. To solve those time-consuming problems, a new kind of <b>thermal</b> distortion <b>analysis</b> method was developed. In this method, inherent strains are devised to be used as direct input factors as boundary conditions. Suggested analysis method was already adopted at welding distortion analysis of large hull block, which was considered as impossible...|$|R

50|$|A true {{workhorse}} for polymer characterization is <b>thermal</b> <b>analysis,</b> particularly Differential scanning calorimetry. Changes in the compositional {{and structural}} {{parameters of the}} material usually affect its melting transitions or glass transitions and these in turn {{can be linked to}} many performance parameters. For semicrystalline polymers it is an important method to measure crystallinity. Thermogravimetric analysis can also give an indication of polymer thermal stability and the effects of additives such as flame retardants.Other <b>thermal</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques are typically combinations of the basic techniques and include differential <b>thermal</b> <b>analysis,</b> thermomechanical analysis, dynamic mechanical <b>thermal</b> <b>analysis,</b> and dielectric <b>thermal</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

40|$|Heat transfer, thermal stresses, {{and thermal}} {{buckling}} {{analyses were performed}} on the unconventional wing structures of a Hyper-X hypersonic flight research vehicle (designated as X- 43) subjected to nominal Mach 7 aerodynamic heating. A wing midspan cross section was selected for the heat transfer and thermal stress analyses. <b>Thermal</b> buckling <b>analysis</b> was performed on three regions of the wing skin (lower or upper); 1) a fore wing panel, 2) an aft wing panel, and 3) a unit panel at {{the middle of the}} aft wing panel.
