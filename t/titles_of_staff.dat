40|$|In archival science, {{in theory}} and in practice, {{archives}} are fundamentally {{divided into two groups}} as 'public archives' and 'private archives'. Legal possession, right of usage and ownership of archival records underlie aforementioned grouping. In time, as private enterprises or capital stock have reached a remarkable level in state's production and governance, identifying private archives has come into prominence and numerous countries have been obliged to set new legal regulations in their national archival legislation. In this respect, amount and content of private archives have reached considerable dimensions. Archivists, when setting those regulations, have had to correlate some significant rights and freedoms such as the right of privacy, right to demand information and preserving public interests with each other. City archives are a type of private archives. Even though city archives have been operating for ages in Europe {{due to the fact that}} they are crucial in terms of handing down local culture to the next generations, it has been observed that in Turkey, they have just begun to serve under the leadership of local governments from 2000 s onwards. In this study, private archive legislation regulations from Turkey and other countries were examined and compared. In the light of data obtained, the elements needed to be included in National Archives Act regarding private archives were compiled. Concerning city archives, foreign-sourced archives were analyzed. In accordance with the aforesaid analysis, with a view to determine the current state of city archives in our country, a survey, which comprised 7 city archives established by provincial local governments, was conducted. In the view of the data collected from the survey, ' a city archive model ' which is on a national scale and holds international standard components, was created. Within the framework of this model, the components of the proposed model were elaborated under the <b>titles</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff,</b> archive buildings, supplying, preserving, storage, access and digitalising regarding the reconstruction of city archives. Furthermore, concepts of content, method, standards, institutional structuring and sustainability, which are to determine the operational system of the city archive, were discussed in the model...|$|E

50|$|Like their {{civilian}} counterparts, EAs {{are also}} a resource in decision-making, policy setting, and will have leadership oversight of the entire military and civilian staff supporting the civilian official, general officer, or flag officer. EAs are often interchangeable with other senior military officers of equivalent rank holding the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> chief <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> in other service organizations headed by a flag officer or general officer. In the case of unified combatant commands and service major commands, the Chief <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> is often a general officer or flag officer himself/herself, typically at the 1-star or 2-star level, but {{he or she should}} not be confused with the 4-star officers holding the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> Chief <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> <b>of</b> the Army or Chief <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> <b>of</b> the Air Force.|$|R

50|$|The <b>title</b> chief <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> {{identifies}} {{the leader of}} a complex organization, institution, or body of persons and it also may identify a principal staff officer (PSO), who is the coordinator <b>of</b> the supporting <b>staff</b> or a primary aide-de-camp to an important individual, such as a president or a senior military officer.|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{creation}} of the chief <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> position, the office was headed by the Prime Minister's Principal Secretary, a position which is now secondary to the chief <b>of</b> <b>staff.</b> People who held the position of principal secretary prior to 1987 were essentially de facto chiefs <b>of</b> <b>staff,</b> and may sometimes be informally referred to as chiefs <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> in some sources, but did not hold the formal <b>title</b> chief <b>of</b> <b>staff.</b> Bernard Roy, Brian Mulroney's principal secretary from 1984 to 1988, was the last principal secretary to act as head of the PMO before {{the creation}} of the chief <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> position.|$|R
50|$|In summer 950, {{the leading}} officials, because {{there had been}} {{constant}} Liao incursions that the northern circuits did not have coordinated responses to, discussed a plan to have an overall commander in the north to oversee the defenses against Liao. The decision was for Guo Wei to take up position at Yedu and oversee the operations. Shi Hongzhao advocated for Guo to continue to hold the chief <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> <b>title,</b> {{so that he could}} wield greater weight in his orders to the military governors. Su Fengji opposed, pointing out that there was no precedent for a chief <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> to leave the capital and continue to be chief <b>of</b> <b>staff,</b> but Liu Chengyou upheld Shi's proposal. Thereafter, Guo was made the defender of Yedu and military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (天雄, headquartered at Yedu), and continued to hold the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> chief <b>of</b> <b>staff,</b> with authority to authorize military movements and expenditures north of the Yellow River.|$|R

Unintended Consequences of Child Care Regulations The effects of regulations governing staff-child ratio, group size, and staff qualifications in child care centers are estimated, using data on a sample of centers. The data contain measures <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> characteristics and wages, price of the service, and the developmental quality of the child care provided. Regulations vary across states, but may be endogenous to these outcomes. Estimates with state fixed effects are feasible because regulations vary within states by age group of children and job <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff.</b> Estimates with state fixed effects show that tougher regulations have some impact on input use, but have little or no impact on price and quality. The most striking finding is that tougher regulations reduce staff wages, suggesting that the incidence of child care regulations is on employees of day care centers...|$|R

50|$|When Jonathan Powell stood down as Chief <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> {{at the end}} of the Blair Premiership in June 2007, {{incoming}} Prime Minister Gordon Brown temporarily appointed {{civil servant}} Tom Scholar as both Downing Street Chief <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> and Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister. This was again altered upon Scholar's scheduled departure in January 2008, when the <b>title</b> Chief <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> was divided amongst two posts in an attempt to split the political policy communication role from the management of civil servants within Number 10. As such, senior civil servant Jeremy Heywood replaced Scholar as Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, a position he had held under Tony Blair several years earlier, with the role of Chief of Strategy and Principal Advisor to the Prime Minister (effectively Chief <b>of</b> <b>Staff)</b> being given to political advisor Stephen Carter.|$|R

40|$|As of late, {{regulation}} and increased scrutiny of Higher Education (HIED) {{has caused a}} shift in campus operations, and, correspondingly, in HIED chief executives’ duties (Nelson, 2009). As {{a result of these}} demands, trends suggest that a new approach in supporting HIED executives now goes beyond that of a clerical staffer and instead demands a second in command—chief <b>of</b> <b>staff.</b> ^ According to the National Association of Presidential Assistants in Higher Education 2014 —Member Survey, 15 % of all members have the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> chief <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> (COS) on their campus. Those identifying as COS in this member survey increased 4 % from data collected in the 2012 survey. Being that this support role is growing and insignificant work has been done to professionalize it, an exploratory study was conducted. ^ The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the role of a chief <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> in the higher education setting within the organization and what traits and personalities does one need to be successful in the role. Thirteen higher education chiefs <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> who report to their campus president or chancellor were interviewed. Interviews were conducted to offer better understanding of the roles assumed by chiefs <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> in the office of the campus president/chancellor. The interviewees came from a variety of institutional types, size and location within the United States. ^ Findings from this study led to an initial typology of the position that was dependent on four themes extracted from data collected in interviews. The four themes are: Duties of the COS; Personality of the COS; Traits of the COS; and the COS in their Organization. Each theme, enhanced by multiple sub-themes, creates a basic understanding of the role <b>of</b> chief <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> and establishes a need for additional scholarly work in professionalizing the role <b>of</b> chief <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> in Higher Education. ...|$|R

The two Allied leaders decided that all available Allied forces should be concentrated in the United Kingdom, and that planning for the invasion of North-Western Europe should begin. A provisional target date of May 1944 was set with the code-name 'Overlord' decided upon. A joint Anglo-American planning staff was created under Lieutenant-General Frederick E.

50|$|Churchill was re-elected in 1951 and in {{addition}} to being Prime Minister, he also took the office of Secretary of State for Defence.

Jacob was less comfortable working for Alexander than for Churchill, but a new opportunity arose for him in June 1952, when Haley announced he was to leave the BBC to become editor of The Times.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, {{the title}} [...] "general in-chief" [...] {{was used to}} refer to the {{commanding}} general of the United States Army, who was the Army's senior-most officer.
