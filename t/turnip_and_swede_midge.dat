5000|$|Rutabaga {{has many}} {{national}} and regional names. Rutabaga is the common North American term for the plant. This comes from the old Swedish dialectal word rotabagge, from rot (root) + bagge (short, stumpy object; probably related to bag). In the U.S., the plant {{is also known as}} Swedish turnip or yellow turnip. The term swede is used instead of rutabaga in many Commonwealth Nations, including much of England, Australia, and New Zealand. The name turnip is also used in parts of Northern and Midland England, the West Country (particularly Cornwall), Ireland, Manitoba, Ontario and Atlantic Canada. In Wales, according to region it is variously known as maip, rwden, erfin, swedsen or swejen in Welsh [...] <b>and</b> as <b>swede</b> or <b>turnip</b> in English. In Scotland, it is known as <b>turnip,</b> <b>and</b> in Scots as tumshie or neep (from Old English næp, Latin napus). Some areas of south east Scotland, such as Berwickshire and Roxburghshire, still use the term baigie, possibly a derivative of the original Swedish rutabaga. The term turnip is also used for the white turnip (Brassica rapa ssp rapa). Some will also refer to both <b>swede</b> <b>and</b> (white) <b>turnip</b> as just turnip (this word is also derived from næp). In North-East England, <b>turnips</b> <b>and</b> <b>swedes</b> are colloquially called snadgers, snaggers (archaic) or narkies.|$|R

40|$|In Quebec, the <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> (Contarinia nasturtii), a newly {{invasive}} pest, {{was found}} {{for the first time}} in 2003. During a two year study (2004 - 2005) I studied the seasonal development of the <b>swede</b> <b>midge,</b> the presence of natural enemies and tested entomopathogenic nematodes for its control. Results showed that the overwintering generation of the <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> emerged during the second half of June. Based on adult captures and abundance of larvae in the field, there were three to four overlapping generations. Late transplants were more heavily attacked by the <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> <b>and</b> broccoli and cauliflower were the most susceptible crops. No parasitoids were found in the experimental sites during either year of the study and two polyphagous coccinellid predators (Harmonia axyridis and Coccinella septempunctata) were field-collected for further evaluation under laboratory conditions. Although these two coccinellid species fed on <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> larvae in plastic containers, further experiments demonstrated that H. axyridis was not able to prey on <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> larvae on infested broccoli plants. The susceptibility of <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> larvae to three species of entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernema feltiae, S. carpocapsae, and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora) was also evaluated in laboratory assays. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora was the only species that caused significant mortality to <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> larvae <b>and,</b> at a concentration of 1000 IJs/larva, caused 90 - 100 % mortality in loam, sandy loam, clay and muck soil. This is the first study describing the seasonal development of the <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> in Quebec. In addition, the potential use of entomopathogenic nematodes as biological control agents against the <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> is demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|With the <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> (Contarinia nasturtii) as {{our main}} model species, we study {{two types of}} {{olfactory}} cues that are of importance for gall midges: 1) the pheromones emitted by the female to attract the male; 2) and the host plant volatiles that the females use when finding a host for oviposition. We found that both the blend of compounds and the enantioisomeric form are important for male attraction in the wind tunnel and in the field. For pheromone reception, the gall midges use the sensillum type that display sexual dimorphism, male <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> use the gall midge specific sensilla circumfila while the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) use s. trichodea. In a detailed study of the female host finding behavior, we found that olfactory cues are important for the <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> host selection. However, this "first impression" can be modulated by later plant characters, such as the physical defense of the host plant, or which host plants are available. By using the electrophysiological technique GC-EAD, we compared the response of 12 gall midge species, including the <b>swede</b> <b>midge,</b> to a blend of 45 plant volatiles to explore the relative impact of host plant chemistry, life-history strategies and the midge phylogeny on the gall midge host plant recognition system. ...|$|R

50|$|Downy mildew is {{a disease}} of major {{importance}} on the horticultural Brassica species. It is most serious on the flowerhead types (cauliflower, broccoli), less serious on the leaf brassicas (cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and least serious on the root brassicas (<b>turnips,</b> <b>swedes)</b> <b>and</b> oil brassicas (rape). The pathogen persists as oospores in the soil. Attacks are most important in Brassica seedbeds, with infection appearing as yellow speckling of the upper surface of seedling leaves, and white mildew on the lower surface. Severely affected seedlings are stunted or killed. Similar symptoms appear on leaves in the field, causing premature senescence and favouring bacterial spoilage in the cold store after harvest. Affected Brussels sprouts show black spotting, which reduces their market quality. The heads of flowerhead brassicas can be severely affected, and become unmarketable.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{exclusion}} fences on the colonization of broccoli and kohlrabi by the <b>Swede</b> <b>midge,</b> Contarinia nasturtii (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). The <b>Swede</b> <b>midge</b> Contarinia nasturtii (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) {{is an important}} and wide spread pest in Europe. In Swiss organic vegetable production only the expensive product “Audienz“ (active matter: Spinosad) is permitted. In addition, netting the entire crop surface can exclude the <b>Swede</b> <b>midges</b> from crops, {{but it has a}} negative influence on the microclimatic conditions and the labour and capital cost are often too high. Since it is known, that several vegetable key pest species spread within the crop or only a few centimetres above it, the use of vertical exclusion fences has been developed in Canada. The objective of our study was to exclude C. nasturtii from the crops by using a similar, but cheaper prototype of exclusion fence. The studies were undertaken on two fields (broccoli and kohlrabi) and the effect of the fences (fenced in area: 15 x 20 m for broccoli, 7. 5 x 20 m for kohlrabi; height of fences: 1. 4 m with a 0. 25 m overhang; 4 replications each field) was compared with an untreated control and with a treatment of „Audienz“ (3 applications, 0. 5 l/ha). At harvest the damages were assessed by classifying the symptoms of 100 plants per treatment and replication in three (kohlrabi) or four (broccoli) categories. Inside the fences 100 plants near the fence and 100 plants in the centre were visually controlled. The exclusion fences significantly reduced the damages caused by the <b>Swede</b> <b>midge.</b> The treatment of “Audienz“ reduced the damages, too, but in the broccoli trial, “Audienz“ had a significantly lower effect than the fences.

He befriended two children, brother and sister John and Sue Peters, who often tried to clear up the messes he created. Worzel had a collection of interchangeable <b>turnip,</b> mangel wurzel <b>and</b> <b>swede</b> heads; each suiting a particular occasion or allowing him to perform a certain task. He also had his own language, Worzelese. Worzel's catchphrases were: [...] "A cup o' tea an' a slice o' cake", [...] "I'll be bum-swizzled" [...] and [...] "Bozzy MCoo".

50|$|Contarinia nasturtii, the <b>swede</b> <b>midge,</b> {{is a small}} fly, {{the larvae}} of which infest {{brassica}} plants, causing twisting and distortion of the leaf stems and foliage including death of the growing point in seedlings, or damage to developing flower heads. It is native to Europe and Turkey, and has been introduced into North America where it is regarded as an invasive species.|$|R
40|$|Early {{detection}} of pest infestation {{is a prerequisite}} for sustainable crop protection. However, many pest species are difficult to detect and thus infestation is diagnosed from damage observed on the respective crop. This diagnosis is often made too late for implementation of crop protection measures, and serious crop losses may result. The <b>swede</b> <b>midge,</b> Contarinia nasturtii Kieffer, is a major pest of Brassica L. (Brassicaceae) vegetables in Europe that has recently invaded North America. With its small size and short adult life-span, and the cryptic lifestyle of the larvae feeding at the growing points of its host plants, it is usually detected only after damage has already occurred. Furthermore, because field-trapped specimens are rarely fully intact, it is extremely difficult to identify. Therefore, we developed a species-specific molecular diagnostic method that enables reliable identification of <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> from various sources such as alcohol or sticky glue traps. The method enables large-scale screening of field-trapped specimens and is used to evaluate the attractiveness and specificity of pheromone traps that are currently under developmen...|$|R
500|$|As {{a fast-growing}} plant, {{diseases}} are not generally {{a problem with}} radishes, but some insect pests can be a nuisance. The larvae of flea beetles (Delia radicum) live in the soil, but the adult beetles cause damage to the crop, biting small [...] "shot holes" [...] in the leaves, especially of seedlings. The <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> (Contarinia nasturtii) attacks the foliage and growing tip of the plant and causes distortion, multiple (or no) growing tips, and swollen or crinkled leaves and stems. The larvae of the cabbage root fly sometimes attack the roots. The foliage droops and becomes discoloured, and small, white maggots tunnel through the root, making it unattractive or inedible.|$|R
50|$|Host {{plants for}} the <b>swede</b> <b>midge</b> include cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, {{kohlrabi}} {{and a number}} of wild plants in the brassica family including shepherd’s purse, field penny-cress, field peppergrass and yellow rocket. When a seedling or young plant is attacked, the larvae conglomerate and secrete saliva which softens the plant cuticle and epidermis, sucking in the resulting fluid. On a leaf stalk, this damages the tissues and results in the formation of a corky gall. The undamaged side of the stalk continues to grow normally which results in twisting and distortion. The growing point can be completely killed and secondary bacterial infections can occur. If the infection occurs in the flowering stage of cauliflower, it causes a stunted, multi-branched, tuft-like appearance of the flower-head.|$|R

The eggs need moisture to hatch and the larvae emerge in between one and ten days at [...] respectively. They feed for between one and three weeks, again depending on temperature, and produce a gall. When fully grown they descend to the soil and either pupate in an oval cocoon at a depth of about 5 cm or, in adverse weather conditions, become dormant in a globular cocoon buried deeper in the soil. The adults emerge one and a half to seven weeks after pupation and there are several generations each year.|$|R

For these purpose <b>turnip</b> <b>and</b> lettuce plants were cultivated in soil irrigated with wastewater then heavy metals content of the soil, plant growth, yield and the subsequent changes in biochemical constituents of plant were examined. Irrigation with wastewater was found to load the soil with heavy metals (Pb, Co, Ni and Cd) that were not detected in soil before irrigation. The magnitude of Cd in soils after irrigation with industrial wastewater exceeds the maximum allowable limit (3 mg Kg- 1). Both <b>turnip</b> <b>and</b> lettuce exhibited significant decreases in leaf area, fresh weight and dry weight of shoots and roots as well as all the measured yield components in response to wastewater irrigation. The magnitude of decrease was positively correlated with the amounts of heavy metals detected in the soil and the inhibitory effect on turnip was much more pronounced than in lettuce. Furthermore, heavy metals accumulation in soil resulted in an oxidative damage to <b>turnip</b> <b>and</b> lettuce as indicated by the significant increase in lipid peroxidation and H 2 O 2 levels in both plants comparing to control values. The significant increases in putrescine in lettuce <b>and</b> <b>turnip</b> shoots <b>and</b> roots and spermidine in lettuce roots as well as total phenolics and flavonoids in plants cultivated in soil enriched with heavy metals are believed to be defense mechanisms in <b>turnip</b> <b>and</b> lettuce plants to counteract the oxidative stress resulted from heavy metals contamination generated from irrigation with wastewater...|$|R
