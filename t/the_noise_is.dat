5|$|Michelle {{undergoes}} a session of regression hypnosis, where she {{claims to be}} twenty-four years old. She suddenly starts screaming in panic about someone trying to kill her, and the session is ended. Mulder reviews the video of the session, and {{is convinced that the}} girl is the reincarnation of Morris, having been conceived right around the time the detective was murdered. The tape contains a brief section of static noise just before Michelle begins screaming, which Mulder has an expert clean up. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> found to contain a grainy image of {{what appears to be a}} fish tank ornament of a man in an atmospheric diving suit. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Morris' autopsy findings, which show the presence of salt water in his respiratory tract, indicating he died of drowning. The agents realise from these findings that Morris was drowned in the exotic fish tank in Fiore's house.|$|E
25|$|A {{wall with}} porous surface {{material}} and sound-dampening content material can be absorptive where {{little or no}} noise is reflected back towards the source or elsewhere. Hard surfaces such as masonry or concrete {{are considered to be}} reflective where most of <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> reflected back towards the noise source and beyond.|$|E
25|$|Brown rats {{also produce}} {{communicative}} noises {{capable of being}} heard by humans. The most commonly heard in domestic rats is bruxing, or teeth-grinding, which is most usually triggered by happiness, but can also be 'self-comforting' in stressful situations, such as {{a visit to the}} vet. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> best described as either a quick clicking or 'burring' sound, varying from animal to animal.|$|E
40|$|Polarization {{fluctuations}} {{were measured}} in nanoscale volumes of a polymer glass during aging following a temperature quench {{through the glass}} transition. Statistical properties of <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>were</b> studied in equilibrium and during aging. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> spectral density had a larger temporal variance during aging, i. e. <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> more non-Gaussian, demonstrating stronger correlations during aging...|$|R
30|$|If {{the flat}} {{area of the}} image can be {{accurately}} extracted, then the variance of <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> can <b>be</b> evaluated. In a local flat area, assuming that <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> signal <b>is</b> Gaussian white <b>noise,</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> expectation <b>is</b> 0 and <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> variance <b>is</b> σ 2. The mean of the ideal signal is {{the mean of the}} signal, and the variance of the signal is 0.|$|R
5000|$|The {{signal and}} <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>are</b> {{statistically}} independent of each other.|$|R
25|$|Depictions of rats {{in fiction}} are {{historically}} inaccurate and negative. The most common falsehood is the squeaking almost always heard in otherwise realistic portrayals (i.e. nonanthropomorphic). While the recordings {{may be of}} actual squeaking rats, <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> uncommon – they may do so only if distressed, hurt, or annoyed. Normal vocalizations are very high-pitched, well outside the range of human hearing. Rats are also often cast in vicious and aggressive roles when in fact, their shyness helps keep them undiscovered for so long in an infested home.|$|E
25|$|Most older {{hearing aids}} have only an {{omnidirectional}} microphone. An omnidirectional microphone amplifies sounds equally from all directions. In contrast, a directional microphone amplifies sounds from one direction more than sounds from other directions. This means that sounds originating {{from the direction}} the system is steered toward are amplified more than sounds coming from other directions. If the desired speech arrives {{from the direction of}} steering and <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> from a different direction, then compared to an omnidirectional microphone, a directional microphone provides a better signal to noise ratio. Improving the signal-to-noise ratio improves speech understanding in noise. Directional microphones {{have been found to be}} the second best method to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (the best method was an FM system, which locates the microphone near the mouth of the desired talker).|$|E
500|$|The {{broadcast}} media industry is {{at a critical}} turning point in its development, with many countries moving from analog to digital broadcasts. This move is {{made possible by the}} production of cheaper, faster and more capable integrated circuits. The chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts. For television, this includes the elimination of problems such as snowy pictures, ghosting and other distortion. These occur {{because of the nature of}} analog transmission, which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the final output. Digital transmission overcomes this problem because digital signals are reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not affect the final output. In a simplified example, if a binary message 1011 was transmitted with signal amplitudes [...] and received with signal amplitudes [...] it would still decode to the binary message 1011 — a perfect reproduction of what was sent. From this example, a problem with digital transmissions can also be seen in that if <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> great enough it can significantly alter the decoded message. Using forward error correction a receiver can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message but too much noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the transmission.|$|E

2500|$|... where S is the power, at the receiver, of the {{incoming}} signal from said transmitter, I is the combined power {{of all the other}} (interfering) transmitters in the network, and N is the power of some thermal noise term. The SINR reduces to SNR when there is no interference (i.e. I=0). [...] In networks where <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> negligible, also known as [...] "interference limited" [...] networks, we N=0, which gives the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR).|$|E
2500|$|When pulse {{compression}} {{is carried out}} in digital signal processing, after the incoming signals are digitised by A/D converters, {{it is important that}} level of the noise floor is correctly set. [...] The noise floor at the A/D must be high enough to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> adequately characterised. [...] If the noise level is too low, Nyquist [...] will not be satisfied, and any embedded chirp will not be recovered correctly. [...] On the other hand, setting the noise level unnecessarily high will reduce the dynamic range capability of the system.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presence}} or absence of a guessing or pseudo-chance parameter is a major and sometimes controversial distinction. [...] The IRT approach includes a left asymptote parameter to account for guessing in multiple choice examinations, while the Rasch model does not because it is assumed that guessing adds randomly distributed noise to the data. As <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> randomly distributed, it is assumed that, provided sufficient items are tested, the rank-ordering of persons along the latent trait by raw score will not change, but will simply undergo a linear rescaling. [...] By contrast, three-parameter IRT achieves data-model fit by selecting a model that fits the data, at the expense of sacrificing specific objectivity.|$|E

2500|$|Many spiny {{lobsters}} produce rasping sounds to repel predators by rubbing the [...] "plectrum" [...] {{at the base}} of the spiny lobster's antennae against a [...] "file". <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> produced by frictional vibrations - sticking and slipping, similar to rubber materials sliding against hard surfaces. While a number of insects use frictional vibration mechanisms to generate sound, this particular acoustic mechanism is unique in the animal kingdom. Significantly, the system does not rely on the hardness of the exoskeleton, as many other arthropod sounds do, meaning that the {{spiny lobsters}} can continue to produce the deterrent noises even in the period following a moult when they are most vulnerable. The stridulating organ is present in all but three genera in the family (Jasus, Projasus, and the furry lobster Palinurellus), and its form can distinguish different species.|$|E
2500|$|In piano technology, swaging {{happens in}} several areas: key leads, underlever leads, and bass strings. Key leads which, in the piano's {{earliest}} history, were actually made using lead, are soft, round chunks that are inserted into holes drilled {{into the side}} of piano keys as a means of balancing actions. Key leads vary in size, generally small, medium, and large. Basically, key leads help to make a keyboard's touch light enough to play. Over time, due to fluctuations in humidity and as the wood ages in piano key-sticks and underlevers, space develops around leads causing them to rattle, tick, or knock. Loose leads in underlevers tend to be the most annoying to pianists because it's difficult to pinpoint where the noise (often a [...] "tick" [...] sound) is coming from. The remedy for <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> swaging—squashing the leads with a short steel rod. Swaging the lead fills the void and eliminates the noise.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, The KLF {{released}} a limited edition mail order only single containing {{a new version}} of [...] "3 a.m." [...] featuring the grindcore/crust punk band Extreme Noise Terror. The two bands also performed a live version of the song at that year's BRIT Awards ceremony. The Brits performance included by a limping, kilted, cigar-chomping Drummond firing blanks from an automatic weapon {{over the heads of the}} crowd. After viewing the rehearsals, the NME writer Danny Kelly said: [...] "Compared to what's preceded it, this is a turbo-powered metallic wolf breaking into a coop full of particularly sick doves... And the noise? Well, <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> hardcore punk thrash through a disco Techno hit played by crusties. All bases covered, brilliantly. Clever, clever bastards." [...] At the end of the performance, Scott Piering announced to a stunned crowd that [...] "The KLF have now left the music business". Within a few months, they did just that - their records were deleted and The KLF retired from the industry.|$|E

2500|$|The {{tone of the}} Moria {{sequence}} was altered. In the book, {{following the}} defeat on the Caradhras road, Gandalf advocates the Moria road against {{the resistance of the}} rest of the Fellowship (save Gimli), suggesting [...] "there is a hope that Moria is still free...there is even a chance that Dwarves are there," [...] though no one seems to think this likely. [...] Frodo proposes they take a company vote, but the discovery of Wargs on their trail forces them to accept Gandalf's proposal. [...] They only realize the Dwarves are all dead once they reach Balin's tomb. [...] The filmmakers chose instead for Gandalf to resist the Moria plan as a foreshadowing device. Gandalf says to Gimli he would prefer not to enter Moria, and Saruman is shown to be aware of Gandalf's hesitance, revealing an illustration of the Balrog in one of his books. The corpses of the dwarves are instantly shown as the Fellowship enter Moria. One detail that many critics commented upon is the fact that, in the novel, Pippin tosses a mere pebble into the well in Moria ("They then hear what sounds like a hammer tapping in the distance"), whereas in the film, he knocks an entire skeleton in ("Next, the skeleton ... falls down the well, also dragging down a chain and bucket. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> incredible.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Pupa. Suspended by {{the tail}} and a band that encircles it much nearer the head than is usual with Papilio pupae. In form stout, flattened, dilated in the middle, with head and thorax thrown back. Head {{somewhat}} angular and tuberculated; two of the abdominal segments each with a prominent dorsal pair of pointed tubercles. Colour usually light brown, with a strongly contrasting saddle of old gold. (After Davidson & Aitken) - Mr T. A. Sealy (Proc. Ent Soc. 1875 p.9) states- [...] "The pupa possesses the power of making a curious noise like pha-pha!, and makes it very loudly when touched; <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> accompanied (perhaps produced) by a short contraction of the abdominal segments. I thought {{at first it was}} merely produced by the rubbing of one ring of the pupa-case against the next, but the sound did not resemble a mere frictional sound, it was more like the sound of a rush of air through small holes. I tried to produce it with a dead chrysalis but failed: the pupa sometimes contracted on being touched without making the noise, and appeared unable to make the noise until some time was given to allow it to recover its vigour." [...] Messrs. Davidson and Aitken have also noticed this power in the pupa, but they speak of it [...] "as a husky squeaking noise, produced apparently by friction of the abdominal rings." ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Shrew, {{these lines}} are spoken by Katherina {{near the end}} of the play. Petruchio's {{response}} is to beat her and anally rape her as his [...] "gang" [...] hold her down. As she is being raped, a high-pitched whistle sounds, with Katherina's mouth open as if <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> her scream. At this point, the lights go down, and when they come back up, Katherina is dressed in an institutional gown. She delivers her final speech as if she has learned it, without any emotion or inflection, and requiring frequent prompting by Petruchio. As she finishes, she is flanked by the modern day couple, one on each side of her, both in wedding attire, posing for imaginary photographers, [...] "a juxtaposition suggesting that marriage legitimates psycho-social and psycho-sexual abuse." [...] The final image of the play is Katherina in a wedding gown, chained to the ground, as a funeral bell tolls. Foregrounding the themes of sadism and brain washing, in this version, the happy ending of Shakespeare's play thus takes on a disturbing irony. Marowitz described his intention in The Shrew as [...] "a head-on confrontation with the intellectual substructure of the play, an attempt to test or challenge, revoke or destroy the intellectual foundation which makes a classic the formidable thing it has become [...] combat the assumptions of a classic with a series of new assumptions, and force it to bend under the power of a new polemic." [...] Due to the extreme nature of the production, the play divided critics and audiences, but it was a huge box office success.|$|E
