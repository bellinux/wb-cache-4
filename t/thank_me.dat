However, at each venue her audiences dwindled and investors were non-existent. By 2002, Bryant and her second husband Charlie Dry had claimed bankruptcy in three states.

500|$|<b>Thank</b> <b>Me</b> Later has a languorous, ambient {{production}} and {{is characterized by}} subtle arrangements, obscured keyboards, skittering snare drums, reverbed percussion, sparse , moody synthesizers, and minor keys. Lyrically, <b>Thank</b> <b>Me</b> Later has moody, introspective subject matter, and mainly centers around Drake's introduction to fame and his romances. The Toronto Star describes the content as [...] "about the sorts of doubts, excesses, betrayals and creeping paranoid suspicions that arrive hand-in-hand with celebrity." [...] Music journalist Greg Kot describes the album as [...] "personal and eccentric, the journal of a flawed, self-doubting regular guy rather than a strutting icon-in-waiting." ...|$|E
500|$|Music writers liken <b>Thank</b> <b>Me</b> Later to Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak. Nathan Rabin writes that, [...] "musically, Drake favors warm washes of synthesizers {{that create}} a melancholy, fragile mood redolent of 808s & Heartbreak." [...] Comparisons are also drawn to Man on the Moon: The End of Day by Kid Cudi, a protégé of West. By contrast, Joshua Ostroff of The Globe and Mail feels that <b>Thank</b> <b>Me</b> Laters [...] "emotional navel-gazing lacks West's often-suffocating self-pity and offers a proper {{synthesis}} of rap and R" [...] Jeff Weiss of the Los Angeles Times views that the album ignores West's celebratory side [...] "in search of anthems for the easily alienated." ...|$|E

[...] Pitchfork critic Ryan Dombal said [...] "Drake vies for superstardom while embracing his non-drug-dealing, non-violent, non-dire history-- one that connects with most rap fans {{in a completely}} reasonable way." [...] In The A.V. Club, Rabin wrote that [...] "on his cohesive, bittersweet, assured debut, he proves himself worthy of the sometimes-blinding spotlight." [...] Rosen, writing for Rolling Stone, found Drake to be [...] "in total command of a style {{that would have been}} hard to imagine dominating hip-hop a few years ago". In the opinion of Ben Detrick from Spin, <b>Thank</b> <b>Me</b> Later had [...] "dynamics like few other hip-hop albums before it", and while [...] "Drake's personal anecdotes lack the bravado of bullet-wound boasts", they were [...] "intimate and lyrically detailed enough to draw blood." [...] Prefix critic Wilson McBee deemed it one of the few pop-rap records [...] "that comes close to being a classic".|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Freedom" [...] is a hip hop and R {{song that}} follows a similar style to other Minaj songs heard on her debut album, Pink Friday.

Lyrically, Minaj is still confrontational yet reflective, {{talking about her}} life in the spotlight and rise to fame.
