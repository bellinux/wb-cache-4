The Park, a spin-off game from The Secret World, has a sequence inspired by P.T., and the horror game Layers of Fear was heavily inspired by P.T. as well.|$|E
5|$|Edge of Darkness is a British {{television}} drama serial, {{produced by}} BBC Television {{in association with}} Lionheart Television International and originally broadcast in six fifty-five-minute episodes in late 1985. A mixture of crime drama and political thriller, it revolves around the efforts of policeman Ronald Craven (played by Bob Peck) <b>to</b> <b>unravel</b> <b>the</b> truth behind {{the murder of his}} daughter Emma (played by Joanne Whalley). Craven's investigations soon lead him into a murky world of government and corporate cover-ups and nuclear espionage, pitting him against dark forces that threaten the future of life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Nielsen briefly {{appeared}} on the World Wrestling Federation program {{in the summer of}} 1994 on WWF Monday Night Raw; capitalizing on Frank Drebin. Nielsen (and George Kennedy) were hired as sleuths <b>to</b> <b>unravel</b> <b>the</b> mystery of The Undertaker who had disappeared at January's Royal Rumble event. At SummerSlam 1994, in a Naked Gun parody, they were hot on the case (in fact, they were standing on a case). Although they did not find The Undertaker, the case had been closed (the literal case had been shut) and thus, they solved the mystery. In 1990, Nielsen appeared as a Frank Drebin character in advertisements in the United Kingdom for Red Rock Cider.|$|E
5|$|Silent Hill 3 {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} {{universe}} of the Silent Hill series. Seventeen years before the start of Silent Hill 3, in the year 1983, Harry Mason defeated a god brought forth by the resident cult of Silent Hill and at the ending, was given a baby girl to care for. The protagonist and player character of Silent Hill 3 is Heather, the teenaged adopted daughter of Harry. Claudia Wolf, the cult's priestess who plans to bring about a paradise on Earth, serves as the game's antagonist. As Heather attempts <b>to</b> <b>unravel</b> <b>the</b> reasons why the cult of Silent Hill is pursuing her, she encounters a private investigator named Douglas Cartland; Vincent, a member of the cult who detests Claudia; and Leonard Wolf, Claudia's abusive father.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of perspective {{was part of}} a wider trend towards realism in the arts. Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of Leonardo da Vinci, human anatomy. Underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and <b>to</b> <b>unravel</b> <b>the</b> axioms of aesthetics, with the works of Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists. Other notable artists include Sandro Botticelli, working for the Medici in Florence, Donatello, another Florentine, and Titian in Venice, among others.|$|E

5|$|A natural {{experiment}} permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families {{after the end}} of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting <b>to</b> <b>unravel</b> <b>the</b> effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.|$|E

5|$|After {{the events}} of the season six finale, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) are desperately {{attempting}} to find the truth behind the so-called alien object. Meanwhile, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still imprisoned by his own frenetic brain activity. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Skinner are unaware of FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley's (Mimi Rogers) duplicity—she is working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). Scully then travels to Africa <b>to</b> <b>unravel</b> <b>the</b> secrets of the alien artifacts, finding something that looks like a spaceship buried under the shoreline off the Côte d'Ivoire coast. The object may prove that life originated elsewhere, and all religion is based on the Navajo contact with alien life. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder in Washington, D.C., but instead she finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. Cigarette Smoking Man has taken Mulder to a place where all his problems seem to have disappeared. Fowley helps Scully locate Mulder, which leads to her death at the hands of Cigarette Smoking Man.|$|E
5|$|John's {{situation}} {{began to}} deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin {{authority in the}} south had been undermined by Richard's giving away of various key castles some years before. His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly eaten away his remaining support in this area too, which {{set the stage for}} a sudden collapse of Angevin power. John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard. In March 1204, Gaillard fell. John's mother Eleanor died the following month. This was not just a personal blow for John, but threatened <b>to</b> <b>unravel</b> <b>the</b> widespread Angevin alliances across the far south of France. Philip moved south around the new defensive line and struck upwards at the heart of the Duchy, now facing little resistance. By August, Philip had taken Normandy and advanced south to occupy Anjou and Poitou as well. John's only remaining possession on the Continent was now the Duchy of Aquitaine.|$|E

As retrotransposable elements, HERVs behave differently from stable genes, and cannot be studied with "Mendelian genetics" concepts only.

40|$|The {{study of}} Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) -infected rat cell clones offers a novel {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>unravelling</b> <b>the</b> mechanisms controlling eukaryotic gene expression. RSV-transformed rat cell clones frequently contain duplicated proviral sequences immediately upstream of an intact provirus. This category of proviral rearrangement is not seen in cells that remain untransformed after RSV infection nor in subsequently segregating transformants.

40|$|The {{aetiology}} of impaired spermatogenesis {{is unknown}} {{in the majority of}} subfertile men. From several studies of concordance for involuntary childlessness among men, we can conclude that there is a substantial familial component in male subfertility and that shared loci segregating through families can be assumed. We now know that deletions on the Y chromosome, which do not penetrate fully, account for some of these cases. There are good reasons to suspect that other cases result from mutations in genes located elsewhere in the genome. In this article, we discuss different approaches <b>to</b> <b>unravelling</b> <b>the</b> molecular basis of impaired spermatogenesis originating from genetic abnormalities in chromosomes other than the Y chromosome. Genetic mapping studies are in general a good approach to detect disease-causing genes that are segregating through a population; they can provide a short-cut <b>to</b> <b>unravelling</b> <b>the</b> biochemistry of a disease. In this paper, we explain our reasons for arguing that linkage and association studies are no promising means to identify the genes causing impaired spermatogenesis. We conclude that direct screening of candidate genes for mutations will be necessary to detect genes involved in impaired spermatogenesis. However, this approach requires studies of the biochemical pathways of normal and abnormal spermatogenesis. Since we have a poor understanding of these pathways, more research is needed into the biochemistry of spermatogenesi...|$|R
