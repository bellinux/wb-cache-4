5|$|Amid {{reports of}} looting, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} safety of the antiquities of the famous Egyptian Museum, near the epicenter of the Cairo protests. Egyptian state television announced in the evening that army commandos had secured the museum. Protesters joined soldiers in protecting the museum, situated beside the burning ruling party headquarters. Looters managed to enter during the night from <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> damage a number of small artifacts, and it was initially reported that they had ripped the heads off two mummies, but subsequent reports claimed that Egypt's top archaeologist had mistaken skulls from other skeletons, and that the mummies were intact.|$|E
5|$|Excavated between 1992 and 1995, it {{is located}} {{underneath}} the western sector of the palace {{at a depth of}} almost 6 meters. The tomb is composed of two rooms opened on each other's with lime plaster floors. Both rooms are rectangular in shape; the eastern room (L.6402) is 4 meters wide, more than 3,5 meters long (total length is unknown due to heavy damage) and west-east oriented. The western room (L.5762) is 5.20 meters long, 4 meters wide and west-east oriented. Limestone was used to build the walls and few blocks protruding from the sides toward the middle of the rooms suggest <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> have been a corbelled vault.|$|E

5|$|In 1685, the Duke of Monmouth led the Monmouth Rebellion {{in which}} Somerset people fought against James II. The rebels landed at Lyme Regis and {{travelled}} north hoping to capture Bristol and Bath, puritan soldiers damaged the west front of Wells Cathedral, tore lead from <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> make bullets, broke the windows, smashed the organ and the furnishings, {{and for a}} time stabled their horses in the nave. They were defeated in the Battle of Sedgemoor at Westonzoyland, the last battle fought on English soil. The Bloody Assizes which followed saw the losers being sentenced to death or transportation.|$|E
5|$|The Moody Blues {{were the}} first musical act to appear with Stevie Ray Vaughan opening, in November 1983, while Rod Stewart has made the most {{appearances}} in the Dome, 11. Many other top acts have made stops in the Saddledome, however the inability of <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> support the massive light, speaker and special effect rigs that some performers currently use has led the city to again be bypassed for some major tours.|$|E
5|$|The rebels, {{heading for}} Warminster {{got as far}} as Trowbridge, but royalist forces cut off the route and Monmouth turned back towards Somerset through Shepton Mallet, {{arriving}} in Wells on 1 July. The soldiers damaged the Bishop's Palace and west front of Wells Cathedral, tearing lead from <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> make bullets, breaking the windows, smashing the organ and the furnishings, and for a time stabling their horses in the nave.|$|E
25|$|Standing seam roofing is {{composed}} of preformed or field-formed pans. The pans run parallel to the slope of <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> and are joined to adjacent pans with double-locked standing seams.

Bin Laden's wife Amal was {{on the edge of}} the bed {{shouting}} in Arabic at the SEALs, and Osama bin Laden dived across the bed, shoving Amal at the same time, for an AKS-74U kept by the headboard. The SEALs fired four shots at bin Laden; the first missed, the second grazed Amal in the calf also missing bin Laden, and the final two hit bin Laden in the chest and head, killing him instantly. In Pfarrer's account, the total time elapsed from jumping on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> Osama bin Laden's death was between 30 and 90 seconds.|$|E
5|$|In 1661, after Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne, Robert Creighton, the king's chaplain in exile, was appointed dean and was bishop {{for two years before}} his death in 1672. His brass lectern, given in thanksgiving, {{can be seen in the}} cathedral. He donated the nave's great west window at a cost of £140. Following Creighton's appointment as bishop, the post of dean went to Ralph Bathurst, who had been chaplain to the king, president of Trinity College, Oxford and fellow of the Royal Society. During Bathurst's long tenure the cathedral {{was restored}}, but in the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, Puritan soldiers damaged the west front, tore lead from <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> make bullets, broke the windows, smashed the organ and furnishings, and for a time stabled their horses in the nave.|$|E
5|$|In total, 36% of all {{materials}} and labour costs were spent in Wales, with approximately 1,000tonnes (157,500 stone) of Welsh slate used. The environmental {{features of the}} building have allowed energy savings of between 30% and 50% compared to buildings without these features. The features include 27 pipes that were drilled 100m below ground, so that during cold spells, water is pumped through the pipes and heated to 14°C by geothermal energy. The hot water is then pumped {{back up to the}} slate floor to warm the building to a constant temperature. In warm spells, the same system helps to keep the building cool. A biomass boiler was installed to use wood chips from recycled waste wood to heat the building, and rainwater is collected from <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> flush the toilets in the building.|$|E

5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{investigate}} the fatal shooting of a man, who was apparently killed for a $1.49 pen. Lewis believes {{there must be}} more to the story, refusing to believe a pen is worth killing for. When they search suspect Mitchell Forman's (Sal S. Koussa) apartment, they find thousands of pens, many of which line the walls like bizarre decorations. Lewis later finds Forman at the police station, where he originally planned to turn himself in, but instead went up to <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide. Lewis lures Forman away from the ledge by enticing him with a beautiful golden pen, which belonged to Lewis' deceased grandmother. Forman is taken into custody. Later, Lewis still cannot believe someone would kill over a pen, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) suggests it is no worse than killing over a car or woman. Lewis, determined not to develop such a strong attachment to a material item, gives his grandmother's pen to Felton (Daniel Baldwin).|$|E
5|$|One day, the Philistine leaders {{assemble}} in {{a temple}} for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, {{one of their}} most important deities, for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson so that people can watch him perform for them. The temple is so crowded that people are even climbing onto <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> watch—and all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all. Samson is led into the temple, and he asks his captors to let him lean against the supporting pillars to rest. He prays for strength and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the people inside.|$|E
5|$|The REVA NXR {{exhibited}} in the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and the Nissan Leaf SV trim both have roof-mounted solar panels. These solar panels are designed to trickle charge the batteries when the car is moving or parked. Another proposed technology is REVive, by Reva. When the REVA NXR's batteries are running low or are fully depleted, the driver is able to send an SMS to REVive and unlock a hidden reserve in the battery pack. Reva has not provided details on how the system will work. The Fisker Karma uses solar panel in <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> recharge the 12-volt lead-acid accessory battery. The Nissan Leaf SL trim also has a small solar panel {{at the rear of}} the roof/spoiler that can trickle charge the auxiliary 12-volt lead-acid battery.|$|E

5|$|Jack {{receives}} {{a call from}} Hughes to say that Bradley {{is about to be}} arrested and urges Bradley to leave Walford as quickly as possible. Bradley and Stacey quickly pack their bags at home. Max Branning (Jake Wood) says an emotional goodbye to his son and Jack agrees to help them escape. They leave via the back door as Max delays the police at the front, and hide a few streets away. Jack also leaves by the back door but Marsden sees him and he is unable to meet Bradley and Stacey, who are nervously waiting. Bradley says they should go without Jack, but when they go to get a taxi to St Pancras railway station, Bradley realises he has left the passports at home and goes back to get them, leaving Stacey to wait. However, Stacey grows impatient and phones him. The police notice him when his phone rings, and in a bid to escape them, he runs up a fire escape and crawls across the roof of The Queen Victoria with an officer following him. He shouts at Stacey to run, but stumbles and falls backwards from <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>to</b> the ground, dying instantly. Max and Stacey are devastated, and he pulls her away from the body. She tells him it is her fault, as Bradley did not kill Archie, she did. The following day, Marsden says the police will no longer be pursuing the investigation. Stacey then goes missing, and on the day of Bradley's funeral, Jack receives news that a court has found Bradley guilty of Archie's murder.|$|E
