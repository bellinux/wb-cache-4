500|$|According to Vanderbilt's All-Southern halfback and 1924 captain-elect Gil Reese, [...] "He {{would never}} let them jump on me. Whenever anyone would {{threaten}} me, Bomar was always right there to say 'Keep your hands off that boy'. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> too. Bomar always looked after me, and he always called back to me when we started on end runs. No one could run interference like Bomar." [...] Bomar and Reese were on an all-time Vanderbilt team in the school's 1934 yearbook, and Bomar was chosen for an Associated Press Southeast Area all-time football team for the era from 1920 to 1969.|$|E
2500|$|After the Court of Arbitration for Sport {{turned down}} an appeal by Russian athletes, Isinbayeva wrote, [...] "Let all those pseudo clean foreign athletes breathe {{a sigh of relief}} and win their pseudo gold medals in our absence. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> fear strength." [...] She called for {{whistleblower}} Yuliya Stepanova to be [...] "banned for life".|$|E
60|$|Sir Isaac was {{understood}} to say vaguely that <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>did.</b> But {{he had become}} very indistinct.|$|E
6000|$|Every one laughed uproariously, as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> at {{an already}} {{admitted}} readiness, and Sir Walter, turning suddenly purple, shouted out: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Council muddled--quarreled. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>do.</b> <b>They</b> {{could not}} {{decide what to}} do with you. You know how they imprisoned you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, sure. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>do.</b> And you'll {{see them}} liven {{up when we}} get 'em in hand [...] . maybe. They're a measly lot, though." ...|$|R
60|$|Then the fairies were sad, {{because they}} could not play with their new brother, but <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> what they were told.|$|E
60|$|Owen {{left the}} room. Audrey was {{hovering}} in the neighbourhood of the door. She came quickly up to him, and his spirits rose, as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> {{at the sight of}} her.|$|E
60|$|I am old-fashioned, Lady Frederick; and {{my idea of}} {{a modest}} girl is that when certain topics are {{mentioned}} she should swoon. Swoon, madam, swoon. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> it when I was a lad.|$|E
6000|$|... "La, sweet your worship, one may lightly answer that, I ween. She {{will go with}} thee. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>do.</b> She {{will ride}} with thee." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{hours since}} she had left had gone very slowly--as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> to people that are waiting--and {{many of them had}} quite given up hope.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> {{make that}} discovery, bless them! Lady Jardine is now {{wrapped up in}} her baby boy. The mother of the cook {{recovered}} her health.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should like}} nothing better,' cried the monkey, his teeth chattering, as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> {{when he was}} pleased. 'But how could I get there? Not by water. Ugh! It makes me ill to think of it!' ...|$|E
60|$|The noisy group grew {{silent as}} <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> when {{their father was}} spoken of. He had died the year before, and since his death the little family had had a hard time. Keith, to hide his feelings, began to hector the rest.|$|E
60|$|But I {{thought of}} my mother, and would not commit myself further, and I rose to leave him; I had, however, waited too long. The mob were surging along the streets, as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> when the magistrates {{came home from the}} Parliament, howling, bellowing, and yelling round the unpopular ones.|$|E
60|$|But {{how pretty}} she is! she thought. Won't the folks around here stare at her! <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> at our boarders, but we've {{never had one}} like her.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] said Mara, quietly; [...] "but then grandpapa and grandmamma {{expected}} you, {{and they}} have gone to bed, as you know <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> after tea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O Lord, sir!' {{answered}} the girl, turning pale, which <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> when I show any sparks of anger, 'Don't {{put yourself in}} a passion--I'll put the letter in the post.|$|R
60|$|The Foxes {{arrived at}} Broadstone {{at the exact}} hour of the morning at {{which they had been}} expected. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> this; even trains which were {{sometimes}} delayed when other visitors came were always on time when they carried the Foxes. They were both perfectly well and happy, as they always were.|$|E
60|$|Bukawai, not {{yet ready}} to give his victim to the beasts, rushed upon the hyenas with his knob-stick. There was a short {{scrimmage}} in which the brutes came off second best, as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>did.</b> Tarzan watched it. He saw and realized the hatred which existed between the two animals and the hideous semblance of a man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your petitioners desire your Honours will tenderly {{consider}} the premisses, and suffer your said petitioners {{to continue their}} trade (those who set them at work, being still willing to employ them, though at lower rates) and your said petitioners will give security {{to make use of}} the same stuff, and dress it in the same manner, as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> and no other. And your petitioners" [...] &c.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course I did, my dear. They {{were quite}} {{conspicuous}} enough; {{but when people}} make {{a great deal of}} their poverty, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> break out in the most unexpected ways.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>do.</b> But I {{should like}} them to like the purely {{individual}} thing in themselves, which makes them act in singleness. And they only like to do the collective thing.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "For neatness, sureness of touch, {{economy of}} effort, John and Mary leave the rest standing. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> [...] [...] [...] {{they are as}} good at home as abroad." [...] New Statesman (c. 1947) ...|$|R
6000|$|Mara's eyes brightened, as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> at this prospect, and Mrs. Pennel said, [...] "Well, I'm glad to {{have the}} child go; she seems so kind o' still and lonesome since Moses went away; really one feels as if that boy took all the noise there was with him. I get tired myself {{sometimes}} hearing the clock tick. Mara, when she's alone, takes to her book more than's good for a child." ...|$|E
60|$|With this {{shadow on}} his mind {{he did not care}} to show himself in the village, and went homeward by a {{roundabout}} track behind a high hedge and across a pasture. Here he beheld scores of coupled earthworms lying half their length {{on the surface of the}} damp ground, as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> in such weather at that time of the year. It was impossible to advance in regular steps without crushing some of them at each tread.|$|E
6000|$|Again {{she walked}} back with him to Dillsborough, passing as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> across the little bridge. He seemed to be very silent as he went, more so than usual,--and as was her wont with him she only spoke {{to him when he}} {{addressed}} her. It was only when he got out on the road that he told her what was on his mind. [...] "Mary," [...] he said, [...] "how will it be with me if that poor fellow dies?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But why? Because it {{is a fine}} day. Englishmen {{say that}} the money of the Japanese comes from heaven, because <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> nothing--so you think. But look now, here is a pretty place." ...|$|R
50|$|Scientists had {{recently}} discovered that when elements combine to form compounds, <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> {{so in the}} same proportions, by weight. John Dalton thought that for this to happen, each element {{had to be made}} of its own unique building blocks, which he called atoms.|$|R
50|$|Northern Slavs {{in modern}} times often do not use the eight-tone music system - {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> use the book Octoechos - rather singing all hymns in the same scale but with different melodies for each tone for each of several types of classifications of hymns.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Pierston did not press her {{further on}} the subject, and Avice showed no {{disposition}} to continue it. They retired rather early, as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> but Pierston remained pacing about his studio a long while, musing on many things, {{not the least}} being the perception that to wed a woman may be {{by no means the}} same thing as to be united with her. The 'old friend' of Avice's remark had sounded very much like 'lover.' Otherwise why should the letter have so greatly disturbed her? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my dear, {{the place}} is taken. The thing is fixed," [...] said Mr Sudberry, with emphasis. Mrs Sudberry was a wise woman. When she was told by her husband that a thing was fixed, she {{invariably}} gave in with a good grace. Her powers of dissuasion having failed,--as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> fail,--she arose, kissed Mr Sudberry's forehead, assured him that she would {{try to make the}} most of it, since it was fixed, and left the room with the comfortable feeling, of having acted the part of a dutiful wife and a resigned martyr.|$|E
6000|$|... "Neil {{sat down}} by the roaring fire, looking quite well {{satisfied}} with himself. It was ten miles from Berwick to the bay shore, and a call at a half way house was just the thing. Then Donald brought out the whisky. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> that eighty years ago, you know. If you were a woman, you could give your visitors a dish of tea; {{but if you were}} a man and did not offer them a 'taste' of whisky, you were thought either very mean or very ignorant.|$|E
5000|$|Vietnam Television at {{late night}} gave a comment with {{quotation}} from Anothai Choopeng [...] "Except Indonesian here every single body finds who is worth winning. I am truly {{disappointed with the}} behaviours from the set of referees. <b>They</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> everything to make the host country win." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{height of}} the {{ambition}} of the less exalted ranks is to be noble, because they conceive to be noble implies to be superior; associating in their minds, as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> a pre-eminence over then equals. But to be noble among nobles, where is the preeminence?" ...|$|R
50|$|Ji-ha's band {{takes off}} with the sister as the lead singer and Doo-ri as a fan. The movie ends as Mr. Park finds the same photo studio and becomes young. He picks her up {{at a bus stop}} and rides off bickering good naturedly as <b>they</b> <b>always</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
