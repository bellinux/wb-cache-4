5|$|Insects {{and other}} {{invertebrates}} {{are a major}} portion of the nuthatch diet, especially during the breeding season, when they rely almost exclusively on live prey, but most species also eat seeds during the winter, when invertebrates are less readily available. Larger food items, such as big insects, snails, acorns or seeds may be wedged into cracks and pounded with the bird's strong bill. Unusually for a bird, the brown-headed nuthatch uses a piece of tree bark as a lever <b>to</b> <b>pry</b> <b>up</b> other bark flakes to look for food; the bark tool may then be carried from tree to tree or used to cover a seed cache.|$|E

Using a hammer, Jerry slams Tom's foot, causing him to lose grip and Butch's fingers to be crushed. Jerry plays [...] "Yankee Doodle" [...] on six of Butch's fingers as a {{keyboard}} and Butch releases them. By then, his fingers turn red as they swell up and pop his nails open, releasing steam with a train whistle sound. Butch instructs Tom to keep quiet and hands him a sledgehammer while he sneaks in through a grate and chases Jerry through {{the walls of the}} house, doing significant damage. Jerry pops out of the hole and Tom swings as instructed, but hits Butch's head instead.|$|R

50|$|Specialised schooners {{known as}} stonehookers would anchor close to shore. A barge {{would be sent}} out to gather the stone.

Reverend Cole (Tom Noonan) aids Bohannon in eluding The Swede, then instructs Bohannon to beg God's forgiveness {{before he is}} caught. Bohannon refuses, stating he does not deserve forgiveness, and leaves. Elam (Common) later hammers the chain free from Bohannon's wrists.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the canal}} was complete, {{navigation}} was {{open on the}} Columbia {{from the mouth of}} the river all the way <b>to</b> <b>Priest</b> Rapids, and, <b>up</b> the Snake River, to the mouth of the Grande Ronde River near Rogersburg. However, completion of the canal came too late to fend off competition from railroads had taken away most of the steamboat's business. Riverine transportation above Celilo never reached the hopes of the proponents of the canal. Only in the late 1930s did the development of wheat barge traffic, eventually driven by diesel towboats, become an important transport method on the Columbia River.|$|R

The {{high priest}} under the law, {{before they went}} into the holy place, there were to be clothed--with a curious garment, a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle, and they were to be made of gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen; and in his garment and glorious {{ornaments}} there must be precious stones, and on those stones there must be written the names of the children of Israel (read Exodus 28), and all this was to signify what a glorious High Priest Jesus Christ should be, and how in the righteousness of God He should appear before God as our High <b>Priest,</b> <b>to</b> offer <b>up</b> the sacrifice that was to be offered for our salvation to God His Father.

Von Klemment reveals that the second train is carrying German troops {{and is on the}} same schedule. Further, von Klemment is to receive orders at each railway station.

50|$|Sergeant Sadowski's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} at Valhey, France. On the afternoon of 14 September 1944, Sgt. Sadowski as a tank commander was advancing with the leading elements of Combat Command A, 4th Armored Division, through an intensely severe barrage of enemy fire from the streets and buildings of the town of Valhey. As Sgt. Sadowski's tank advanced through the hail of fire, it was struck by a shell from an 88-mm. gun fired at a range of 20 yards. The tank was disabled and burst into flames. The suddenness of the enemy attack caused confusion and hesitation among the crews of the remaining tanks of our forces. Sgt. Sadowski immediately ordered his crew to dismount and take cover in the adjoining buildings. After his crew had dismounted, Sgt. Sadowski discovered that 1 member of the crew, the bow gunner, had been unable to leave the tank. Although the tank was being subjected to a withering hail of enemy small-arms, bazooka, grenade, and mortar fire from the streets and from the windows of adjacent buildings, Sgt. Sadowski unhesitatingly returned to his tank and endeavored <b>to</b> <b>pry</b> <b>up</b> the bow gunner's hatch. While engaged in this attempt to rescue his comrade from the burning tank, he was cut down by a stream of machinegun fire which resulted in his death. The gallant and noble sacrifice of his life in the aid of his comrade, undertaken in the face of almost certain death, so inspired the remainder of the tank crews that they pressed forward with great ferocity and completely destroyed the enemy forces in this town without further loss to themselves. The heroism and selfless devotion to duty displayed by Sgt. Sadowski, which resulted in his death, inspired the remainder of his force to press forward to victory, and reflect the highest tradition of the armed forces.|$|E
60|$|General McClellan's theory {{from the}} first {{seems to have been}} that a large army would make a great general, though all history shows that the genius, decision, and {{confidence}} of a leader are the most powerful reinforcement of the troops under his command, and that an able captain makes a small army powerful by recruiting it with his own vigor and enthusiasm. From the time of his taking the command till his removal, he was constantly asking for more men, constantly receiving them, and constantly unable to begin anything with them after he got them. He could not move without one hundred and fifty thousand pairs of legs, and when his force had long reached that number, the President was obliged by the overtaxed impatience of the country <b>to</b> <b>pry</b> him <b>up</b> from his encampment on the Potomac with a special order. What the army really needed was an addition of one man, and that at the head of it; for a general, like an orator, must be moved himself before he can move others. The larger his army, the more helpless was General McClellan. Like the magician's famulus, who rashly undertook to play the part of master, and who could evoke powers that he could not control, he was swamped in his own supplies. With every reinforcement sent him on the Peninsula, his estimate of the numbers opposed to him increased. His own imagination faced him in superior numbers at every turn. Since Don Quixote's enumeration of the armies of the Emperor Alifanfaron and King Pentapolin of the Naked Arm, there has been nothing like our General's vision of the Rebel forces, with their ever-lengthening list of leaders, gathered for the defence of Richmond. His anxiety swells their muster-roll at last to two hundred thousand. We say his anxiety, for no man of ordinary judgment can believe that with that number of men the Rebel leaders would not have divided their forces, with one army occupying General McClellan, while they attempted the capital he had left uncovered with the other.|$|R
