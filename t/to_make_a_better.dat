5|$|The {{forecasting}} of the precipitation {{within the}} next six hours {{is often referred to}} as nowcasting. In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model. A human given the latest radar, satellite and observational data will be able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours. However, there is now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation, including evolution of those features in time.|$|E

5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, {{as the chief}} {{draftsman}} of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies...|$|E

Square Enix released another new trailer for the game, showing various aspects of the storyline, boss battles, along with cutscenes; the end of the trailer showed a then-correct release date for March 28, 2009, along with a price point of ¥5,980, which still stands.|$|E

25|$|Overland {{argued that}} the truth-in-evidence {{provisions}} of the California Constitution required that the long delay in bringing charges which adversely affected {{the quality of the}} evidence which might otherwise have allowed him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> case that there were other suspects, or that the evidence against Lazarus was not as solid as the prosecution claimed, be considered sufficiently negligent enough on the state's part to justify dismissing the case. For example, a witness who could have corroborated the prosecution's account of the confrontation between Rasmussen and Lazarus at the hospital had died in 2000. Prosecutors argued in response that Perry was required to apply federal standards, under which such a delay could only be considered prejudicial if it was shown to have been intentional. Perry agreed, and let the case proceed.|$|E
25|$|When Notre Dame {{athletic}} director Kevin White {{announced to the}} media that Davie would not be retained as head coach of Notre Dame, he cited a disappointing season with the Irish heading {{in the wrong direction}} on the field. A week after the firing of Davie, George O'Leary, seven–year head coach of Georgia Tech, was hired by Notre Dame for the head coaching position. Five days after being hired, however, O'Leary resigned from the position, because of discrepancies on his résumé about receiving a varsity letter and a master's degree while in school. While O'Leary was criticized for lying, some said it gave Notre Dame a chance <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> decision. Finally, two weeks after O'Leary resigned, Notre Dame signed Tyrone Willingham, the seventh–year coach of Stanford, to a six-year contract, ending the Bob Davie era at Notre Dame.|$|E
25|$|O'Leary {{was happy}} to accept what was called his dream job. Five days after being hired, however, O'Leary {{resigned}} from the position.

While O'Leary was criticized for lying, some in the media said that his resignation gave Notre Dame a chance <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> decision. Two weeks after O'Leary resigned, Notre Dame signed Tyrone Willingham, the seventh-year coach of Stanford, to a six-year contract. Willingham became the school's first African American head coach in any sport. He immediately made changes to the Irish program, including changing the long used Irish offense from an option attack to a West Coast type. He also made his first-year Fighting Irish team only the second in Notre Dame history to pick captains on a game-by-game basis.|$|E

500|$|Desson Thomson of The Washington Post {{praised the}} art {{direction}} and set design. [...] "Willis and Pitts's performances, Gilliam's atmospherics and an exhilarating momentum easily outweigh such trifling {{flaws in the}} script", Thomson reasoned. Peter Travers from Rolling Stone magazine cited the film's success on Gilliam's direction and Willis' performance. Internet reviewer James Berardinelli believed the filmmakers took an intelligent and creative motive for the time travel subplot. Rather than being sent to change the past, James Cole is instead observing it <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> future. Richard Corliss of Time magazine felt the film's time travel aspect and apocalyptic depiction of a bleaker future were clichés. [...] "In its frantic mix of chaos, carnage and zoo animals, 12 Monkeys is Jumanji for adults", Corliss wrote.|$|E

He continued training in the Keysi Fighting Method and performed many of his own stunts, but did not gain as much muscle {{as in the previous}} film because the new Batsuit allowed him to move with greater agility. Bale described Batman's dilemma as whether [...] " [...] something that has an end. Can he quit and have an ordinary life? The kind of manic intensity someone has to have to maintain the passion and the anger that they felt as a child, takes an effort after a while, to keep doing that. At some point, you have to exorcise your demons." [...] He added, [...] "Now you have not just a young man in pain attempting to find some kind of an answer, you have somebody who actually has power, who is burdened by that power, and is having to recognize the difference between attaining that power and holding on to it." [...] Bale felt Batman's personality had been strongly established in the first film, so it was unlikely his character would be overshadowed by the villains, stating: [...] "I have no problem with competing with someone else.

The rear portion of the forecastle deck was protected by an upward extension of the upper belt in the area of the forward barbettes and the upper casemates.

Behind the side armour was an inboard longitudinal splinter bulkhead that was [...] thick between the middle and lower decks. This decreased to [...] between the middle and upper decks. The bulkhead sloped away from the edge of the lower deck to the lower edge of the armour belt with a total thickness of 75mm. The slope was one 50mm plate of Krupp non-cemented armour (KNC) on a 25mm nickel-steel plate.
