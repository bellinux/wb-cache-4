40|$|Bronchus-associated {{lymphoid tissue}} (BALT) participates in airway immune responses. However, {{little is known}} about the lymphocyte–endothelial {{adhesion}} cascades that recruit lymphocytes from blood into BALT. We show that high endothelial venules (HEVs) in BALT express substantial levels of VCAM- 1, in marked contrast to HEVs in other secondary lymphoid tissues. BALT HEVs also express the L-selectin ligand PNAd. Anti–L-selectin, anti-PNAd, and anti–LFA- 1 mAbs almost completely block the homing of B and T lymphocytes into BALT, whereas anti–� 4 integrin and anti–VCAM- 1 mAbs inhibit homing by nearly 40 %. � 4 � 7 integrin and MAdCAM- 1 are not involved. Importantly, we found that mAbs against � 4 integrin and VCAM- 1 significantly block the migration of total T cells (80 % memory phenotype) but not naive T and B cells <b>to</b> <b>BALT.</b> These results suggest that an adhesion cascade, which includes L-selectin/PNAd, � 4 � 1 integrin/VCAM- 1, and LFA- 1, targets specific lymphocyte subsets <b>to</b> <b>BALT.</b> This high level of involvement of � 4 � 1 integrin/VCAM- 1 is unique among secondary lymphoid tissues, and may help unify lymphocyte migration pathways and immune responses in BALT and other bronchopulmonary tissues.

40|$|Abstract Background Bronchus-associated {{lymphoid tissue}} (BALT) is the {{secondary}} lymphoid tissue in bronchial mucosa and {{is involved in}} the development of bronchopulmonary immune responses. Although migration of lymphocytes from blood vessels into secondary lymphoid tissues is critical for the development of appropriate adaptive immunity, the endothelia and lymphocyte adhesion molecules that recruit specific subsets of lymphocytes into human BALT are not known. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine which adhesion molecules are expressed on lymphocytes and high endothelial venules (HEVs) in human BALT. Methods We immunostained frozen sections of BALT from lobectomy specimens from 17 patients with lung carcinoma with a panel of monoclonal antibodies to endothelia and lymphocyte adhesion molecules. Results Sections of BALT showed B cell follicles surrounded by T cells. Most BALT CD 4 + T cells had a CD 45 RO + memory phenotype. Almost all BALT B cells expressed α 4 integrin and L-selectin. In contrast, 43 % of BALT T cells expressed α 4 integrin and 20 % of BALT T cells expressed L-selectin. Almost all BALT lymphocytes expressed LFA- 1. HEVs, which support the migration of lymphocytes from the bloodstream into secondary lymphoid tissues, were prominent in BALT. All HEVs expressed peripheral node addressin, most HEVs expressed vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1, and no HEVs expressed mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule- 1. Conclusion Human BALT expresses endothelia and lymphocyte adhesion molecules that may be important in recruiting naive and memory/effector lymphocytes <b>to</b> <b>BALT</b> during protective and pathologic bronchopulmonary immune responses. </p...|$|E
40|$|Measles virus (MV) {{is highly}} infectious, and {{has long been}} thought to enter the host by infecting {{epithelial}} cells of the respiratory tract. However, epithelial cells do not express signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (CD 150), which is the high-affinity cellular receptor for wild-type MV strains. We have generated a new recombinant MV strain expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), based on a wild-type genotype B 3 virus isolate from Khartoum, Sudan (KS). Cynomolgus macaques were infected with a high dose of rMV(KS) EGFP by aerosol inhalation {{to ensure that the}} virus could reach the full range of potential target cells throughout the entire respiratory tract. Animals were euthanized 2, 3, 4 or 5 days post-infection (d. p. i., n = 3 per time point) and infected (EGFP(+)) cells were identified at all four time points, albeit at low levels 2 and 3 d. p. i. At these earliest time points, MV-infected cells were exclusively detected in the lungs by fluorescence microscopy, histopathology and/or virus isolation from broncho-alveolar lavage cells. On 2 d. p. i., EGFP(+) cells were phenotypically typed as large mononuclear cells present in the alveolar lumen or lining the alveolar epithelium. One to two days later, larger clusters of MV-infected cells were detected in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) and in the tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes. From 4 d. p. i. onward, MV-infected cells were detected in peripheral blood and various lymphoid tissues. In spite of the possibility for the aerosolized virus to infect cells and lymphoid tissues of the upper respiratory tract, MV-infected cells were not detected in either the tonsils or the adenoids until after onset of viremia. These data strongly suggest that in our model MV entered the host at the alveolar level by infecting macrophages or dendritic cells, which traffic the virus <b>to</b> <b>BALT</b> or regional lymph nodes, resulting in local amplification and subsequent systemic dissemination by viremi...|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} study we found that a local immune response did not develop in the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) of infected rat allografts. We hypothesized that the BALT in rat lung allografts was damaged after allotransplantation. Therefore, we investigated three prerequisites for a normal function of the BALT, i. e., its structure, the uptake of antigens, and the lymphocyte migration <b>to</b> the <b>BALT</b> in three groups of rats (n = 10 each) : (1) Brown Norway(BN) -to-Lewis (LEW) allografts; (2) LEW-to-LEW isografts; and (3) normal LEW rats. All rats were immunosuppressed with CsA (injected on days 2 and 3).

In the allografts the BALT was defective in all three investigated aspects. It was reduced in size and lymphocyte density and was largely replaced by fibrous tissue. Twenty-four h after administration no carbon particles and only a few labeled lymphocytes were found in the BALT. In contrast, in the syngeneically transplanted and nontransplanted lungs the BALT consisted of a large and dense collection of lymphocytes. In these BALTs large numbers of carbon particles and labeled lymphocytes were found. In conclusion, after allogeneic transplantation the BALT in the lung becomes defective in structure and function. The BALT is most likely damaged by rejection, since the BALT in syngeneic lung transplants was perfectly normal...|$|R

These motifs are presented in the framework of the conception of heaven. An attempt is made to offer some ideas, which might serve as a stimulus in defining the perspective of the solution of some mythological problems. Baltic traditions are compared with those of the Finno-Ugrian mythology. Though the Finno-Ugrians are not genetically related <b>to</b> the <b>Balts,</b> and their languages belong to different families, their cultures nevertheless share analogies, which could be accounted for by affinities of typological character or as a result of prolonged contacts between these two ethnic groups. The study of mythological archaisms in a wider area of dissemination has resulted in more accurate conclusions about the chronology, nature and semantics of the phenomena discussed. The Baltic idea of heaven, which has to do with God the Father - the male deity of the highest status -, is believed to date back to the Indo-European culture. However, such a mythologeme (`Heaven as God') can be treated as rather universal and widespread not only in Indo-European culture, but among other archaic cultures as well. Traces of this viewpoint are present also in the Finno-Ugrian tradition. In general, contacts between the Baltic culture and the Finno-Ugrian mythological traditions have not been subjected to any closer research yet, although the analysis of ages-long neighbourly relations would produce interesting results...|$|R

We examined the time course, distribution, and dependence on vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) - 2 /VEGFR- 3 signaling of lung lymphatics in sustained inflammation. Lymphatics in mouse lungs were examined under baseline conditions and 3 to 28 days after Mycoplasma pulmonis infection, using prospero heomeobox 1 –enhanced green fluorescence protein and VEGFR- 3 as markers. Sprouting lymphangiogenesis was evident at 7  days.  Lymphatic growth was restricted to regions of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), where VEGF-C–producing cells were scattered in T-cell zones. Expansion of lung lymphatics after infection was reduced 68 % by blocking VEGFR- 2, 83 % by blocking VEGFR- 3, and 99 % by blocking both receptors. Inhibition of VEGFR- 2 /VEGFR- 3 did not prevent the formation of BALT. Treatment of established infection with oxytetracycline caused BALT, but not the lymphatics, to regress. We conclude that robust lymphangiogenesis occurs in mouse lungs after M. pulmonis infection through a mechanism involving signaling of both VEGFR- 2 and VEGFR- 3. Expansion of the lymphatic network is restricted <b>to</b> regions of <b>BALT,</b> but lymphatics do not regress when BALT regresses after antibiotic treatment. The lung lymphatic network can thus expand in sustained inflammation, but the expansion is not as reversible as the accompanying inflammation...|$|R

Njihovo širenje prema zapadu i jugu trajalo je 400 godina, a imali su snažnu asimilirajuću moć. Stoga je moguće da je njihova domovina izvorno obuhvaćala samo mali teritorij. Pravni oblik asimilacije stranaca bila je tzv. vrv (uže) kao simboličko- društveni fenomen. Primjer sela Police u Sloveniji ukazuje na to da je potrebna sinteza triju interpretativnih modela - autohtoni, alohtoni i kul- turna asimilacija- kako bi razumjeli etnogenezu Slavena. With {{texts of}} Žitie Konstantina (The Life of Constantine, Chapter XIV) and Žitije Metodija (The Life of Methodius, Chapters II and V) from the 9 th century, {{it can be}} {{determined}} that a founda- tion of self-understanding of the Slavs was their language. Therefore, the ethnogenesis of the Slavs is {{to a large extent}} the history of their language. According to research done by linguists, is the Slavic language structurally derived from an older Baltic-Slavic linguistic stage, which was common <b>to</b> subsequent <b>Balts</b> and Slavs. This happened on the southern edge of the territory that was once inhabited by speakers of the Baltic-Slavic langua- ge. River-names indicate a youngest stage of this territory. It overlaps with a group of archaeological cultures {{in the third quarter of}} the rst Millennium BC. At the end of this period moved from Poland to Ukraine a group of people, called Venethi by their western Germanic neighbors. This process resulted in a separation of Slavic language from the Baltic- Slavic language community. In the 4 th century A. D., Goths included Slavs in their tribal confederation, which was dissolved in 375, with the arrival of the Huns. Then began the gradual expansion of the Slavs to the west and sou- th, which was following a withdrawal of Germanic tribes. A relatively uniform Slavic language began to crumble. This expansion ended only 400 years later, when the Slavs settled in the vast area from Hamburg in Germany to Peloponnese in Greece. Belief of researchers that the Slavs settled in this part of Europe very quickly and in large quantities is therefore wrong. It is quite possible that the ho- meland of the Slavs was originally a small territory. The colonisation was gradual and associated with partial assimilation of indigenous peoples, called Vlachs by the Slavs. Power of assimilation of the Slavs was in their free way of life, without taxes. The legal framework for this assimilation was offe- red by the institution of a so-called vrv (rope) as a symbolic-social phenomenon. The territory between the Danube and the Adriatic Sea, the Slavs began to settle in the second half of the 6 th century. This is corroborated with both written sources as well as archaeological n- ds and their radiocarbon dates. An example of Bled in northwestern Slovenia demonstrates that in the 7 th century, new immigrants organized space anew and gave it new names. This topographic names are Slavic, which means that the Slavs brought with them the Slavic language. Folk narrative in a village Police (Western Slovenia) has preserved the memory of the strange newcomers who have settled in the village area, af- ter all residents, except one, died of plague. In the eyes of neighboring inhabitants in the 19 th century, these immigrants were labeled as Gypsies. This is not consistent with the genesis of the village set- tlement, which shows a constant development sin- ce the Early Middle Ages. Folk narrative re ects strong social conditions either from the time of its origin or from the record time. Narrator namely al- ter a story to t his own views on life and his level of comprehension. Looking from this point of wiev, the explanation is quite simple. The name Gypsies is quite recent. In the consciousness of the people it replaced a much older term that had previously designated foreigners, newcomers, those of diffe- rent ethnic origin. These were the ones who created the division of land that has been preserved to the present. In wiev of its place names, they were of Slavic origin. It is therefore most likely that in the area of present-day Police there had been an older settlement inhabited by the Vlachs, which by the Early Middle Ages had been almost depopulated. The new, Slavic settlers had thus chanced upon the 31 Andrej PLETERSKI Etnogeneza Slavena – metode i proces remaining villager and some cultivated land. In the eyes of neighboring Vlachs the Slavic settlers had certainly been viewed as newcomers. The highly interesting notion of us as opposed to the Gypsies, which is inherent in the popular traditi- on of the region, equals to the relation of the Vlachs toward the Slavs-meaning we, the Vlachs against the Gypsies, the Slavs. It denotes that the prevai- ling notion of us, the majority, originates from the indigenous tradition of the Vlachs. This con rms an autochthonous model of Slavic ethnogenesis. Later on these oldsettlers changed their language to the Slavic. This con rms the model of cultural assi- milation. That the folk tradition preserved explicit memory of the Slavic colonization, would not have been possible, if it would not have actually occurred in the Early Middle Ages. This con rms an allocht- honous model of Slavic ethnogenesis. Example of village Police therefore suggests that to understand the ethnogenesis of the Slavs a synthesis of three in- terpretative models–autochthonous, allochthonous, cultural assimilation-is needed...|$|R
