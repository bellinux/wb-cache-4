A few scraps of textile have been recovered by archaeologists, but the best evidence for <b>textile</b> <b>art</b> is where they are represented in other media, such as painted murals or ceramics.

25|$|The {{recorded}} {{history of art}} in Bangladesh {{can be traced to}} the 3rd century BCE, when terracotta sculptures were made in the region. In classical antiquity, a notable school of sculptural Hindu, Jain and Buddhist art developed in the Pala Empire and the Sena dynasty. Islamic art evolved since the 14th century. The architecture of the Bengal Sultanate saw a distinct style of domed mosques with complex niche pillars that had no minarets. Mughal Bengal's most celebrated artistic tradition was the weaving of Jamdani motifs on fine muslin, which is now classified by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage. Jamdani motifs were similar to Iranian <b>textile</b> <b>art</b> (buta motifs) and Western <b>textile</b> <b>art</b> (paisley). The Jamdani weavers in Dhaka received imperial patronage. Ivory and brass were also widely used in Mughal art. Pottery is widely used in Bengali culture.|$|E

25|$|Spinning is {{an ancient}} <b>textile</b> <b>art</b> in which plant, animal or {{synthetic}} fibres are drawn out and twisted together to form yarn. For thousands of years, fibre was spun by hand using simple tools, the spindle and distaff.

Mass production only arose in the 18th century with the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution. Hand-spinning remains a popular handicraft.|$|E

25|$|A popular form of <b>textile</b> <b>art</b> in Japan is shibori (intricate tie dye), {{found on}} some of the more {{expensive}} kimonos and haori kimono jackets. Patterns are created by minutely binding the fabric and masking off areas, then dying it, usually by hand. When the bindings are removed, an undyed pattern is revealed. Shibori work can be further enhanced with yuzen (hand applied) drawing or painting with textile dyes or with embroidery; it is then known as tsujigahana. Shibori textiles are very time-consuming to produce and require great skill, so the textiles and garments created from them are very expensive and highly prized.|$|E
25|$|Scanian culture, as {{expressed}} {{through the medium}} of <b>textile</b> <b>art,</b> has received international attention during the last decade. The art form, often referred to as Scanian Marriage Weavings, flourished from 1750 for a period of 100 years, after which it slowly vanished. Consisting of small textile panels mainly created for wedding ceremonies, the art is strongly symbolic, often expressing ideas about fertility, longevity and a sense of hope and joy. The Scanian artists were female weavers working at home, who had learned to weave at a young age, often {{in order to have a}} marriage chest filled with beautiful tapestries as a dowry.|$|E

A wide range of <b>textile</b> <b>art</b> techniques, including dyeing and weaving, is particularly associated with Pukatja, South Australia (formerly known as Ernabella), but in the mid-2000s the community also developed a reputation for fine sgraffito ceramics.

2500|$|Around 1901, {{inspired}} by the Paris World Fair, Tzigara and other Romanian ethnographers first took into consideration {{the establishment of a}} permanent ethnographic collection.

In similar terms, ethologist Ioana Popescu notes: [...] " [...] collections were to become the argument and the source of inspiration for the national ideology and creation." [...] His project came after a similar attempt on the part of art collector Nicolae Minovici, founder of the private folk art museum Casa Minovici, and an even earlier <b>textile</b> <b>art</b> archive, endorsed by Maiorescu (1875).|$|E

The embroiderer develops the embroidery manually, using the machine's settings for running stitch and fancier built-in stitches. In this way, the stitches form an image {{on a piece of}} fabric. An embroiderer can produce a filled-in effect by sewing many parallel rows of straight stitching. [...] A machine's zigzag stitch can create thicker lines within a design or be used to create a border. Many quilters and fabric artists use a process called thread drawing (or thread painting) to create embellishments on their projects or to create <b>textile</b> <b>art.</b>|$|E

2500|$|According to {{international}} collectors and art scholars, the Scanian patterns are {{of special interest}} for the striking similarities with Roman, Byzantine and Asian art. The designs are studied by art historians tracing how portable decorative goods served as transmitters of art concepts from culture to culture, influencing designs and patterns along {{the entire length of}} the ancient trade routes. The Scanian textiles show how goods traded along the Silk Road brought Coptic, Anatolian, and Chinese designs and symbols into the folk art of far away regions like Scania, where they were reinterpreted and integrated into the local culture. Some of the most ancient designs in Scanian <b>textile</b> <b>art</b> are pairs of birds facing a tree with a [...] "great bird" [...] above, often symbolized simply by its wings. Regionally derived iconography include mythological Scanian river horses in red (...) , with horns on their foreheads and misty clouds from their nostrils. The horse motif has been traced to patterns on 4th- and 5th-century Egyptian fabrics, but in Scanian art it is transformed to illustrate the Norse river horse of Scanian folklore.|$|E
