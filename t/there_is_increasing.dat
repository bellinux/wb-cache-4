5|$|It {{has long}} been presumed {{that there is a}} common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's {{characteristic}} triad of symptoms.

5|$|Although {{antidepressants}} with anxiolytic properties {{have been}} introduced, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasing</b> {{awareness of the}} adverse effects of benzodiazepines, prescriptions for short-term anxiety relief have not significantly dropped. For treatment of insomnia, benzodiazepines are now less popular than nonbenzodiazepines, which include zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone. Nonbenzodiazepines are molecularly distinct, but nonetheless, they work on the same benzodiazepine receptors and produce similar sedative effects.|$|E

40|$|In {{the area}} of {{international}} trade {{few studies have examined}} whether fluctuation in exchange rate is base on macro variables that are used in this study. Basically the study is conducted in Pakistan. As it has <b>been</b> noticed that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> continuously <b>increasing</b> in exchange rate since last 20 years. This paper investigate that foreign direct investment, inflation and supply of money have strong relationship with exchange rate. This means that if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>increase</b> in foreign direct investment then the exchange rate will decrease, if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>increase</b> in supply of money then the exchange rate will grow and if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>increase</b> in inflation then the exchange rate will increase and vice versa...|$|R

5|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) is {{a useful}} treatment when OCD is present, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasing</b> evidence supporting the use of habit reversal (HRT) {{in the treatment of}} tics.

5|$|Various {{inflammatory}} {{processes and}} cytokines {{may also have}} a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation is a general marker of tissue damage in any disease, and may be either secondary to tissue damage in AD or a marker of an immunological response. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasing</b> evidence of a strong interaction between the neurons and the immunological mechanisms in the brain. Obesity and systemic inflammation may interfere with immunological processes which promote disease progression.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasing</b> worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, slate {{quarrying}} began to expand rapidly, {{most notably in}} north Wales. The Penrhyn Quarry, opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant, was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century, and along with Dinorwic Quarry, it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying {{has been described as}} 'the most Welsh of Welsh industries', it is coal mining which has become the single industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw a boom in its demand. As the south Wales coalfield was exploited, mainly in the upland valleys around Aberdare and later the Rhondda, the ports of Swansea, Cardiff and later Penarth, grew into world exporters of coal and, with them, came a population boom. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal. As well as in south Wales, there was also a significant coalfield in the north-east of the country, particularly around Wrexham. As Wales was reliant on the production of capital goods rather than consumer goods, it possessed few of the skilled craftspeople and artisans found in the workshops of Birmingham or Sheffield in England and had few factories producing finished goods – a key feature of most regions associated with the Industrial Revolution. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasing</b> support that the industrial revolution was reliant on harnessing the energy and materials provided by Wales and, in that sense, Wales was of central importance.|$|E
