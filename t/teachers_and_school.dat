5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E
5|$|The book {{contains}} {{content from}} twenty-nine contributors, including psychologists, counselors, <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> therapists. It also includes content from Brown and Logan. General topics {{discussed in the}} work include family, alcohol abuse, relationships, self-esteem, sex and gender, and personality. Specific topics {{in the field of}} psychology include clinical psychology, cognition, abnormal psychology, evolutionary psychology, gambling addiction, Pavlovian conditioning and family therapy. Contributor Denis M. McCarthy, assistant {{professor of psychology at the}} University of Missouri, analyzes risk factors for alcoholism presented in The Simpsons. McCarthy cites Bart's passive-avoidance learning as a risk factor, and notes that Maggie is at a high risk for substance abuse due to violent tendencies.|$|E

40|$|This study uses {{longitudinal}} student-level {{test score}} data {{to examine the}} effectiveness of elementary <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>schools</b> in Los Angeles. The results show that teacher effectiveness varies widely both across the Los Angeles <b>school</b> district <b>and</b> within district <b>schools.</b> Controlling for student background and preparation, we find only modest difference across schools in improving student achievement. We explore the sensitivity of <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> effectiveness measures to alternative regression controls. We find that <b>teacher</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> effectiveness measures are relatively insensitive to detailed controls for student and peer heterogeneity. ...|$|R
30|$|All {{that can}} be said with {{certainty}} is that some <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>schools</b> search for each other based on observable characteristics. Other teachers are content to stay at their school (for the time being, at least). Some <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>schools</b> succeed in matching, and these are observed as transfers in the data. Other <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>schools</b> fail to match, in which case there is no movement. The process is decentralized, with the state providing only a platform for both sides of the markets to post their availability 9.|$|R

25|$|Many <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> districts {{oppose the}} idea of homeschooling. However, {{research}} has shown that homeschooled children often excel in many areas of academic endeavor. According to a study done on the homeschool movement, homeschoolers often achieve academic success and admission into elite universities. There is also evidence that most are remarkably well socialized. According to the National Home Education Research Institute president, Brian Ray, socialization is not a problem for homeschooling children, many of whom are involved in community sports, volunteer activities, book groups, or homeschool co-ops.|$|E
25|$|Discipline in {{educational}} institutions {{from high school}} and up (including vocational schools) are the responsibility of military officers stationed at the individual schools (as opposed to elementary and junior high school where <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> administrators were responsible for discipline). In addition to the normal subjects, students are also required to attend a military education class covering issues such as civil defense, military drills, national defense, and basic firearms. In the past, high (and vocational) school students were expected to take on civil defense duties in the event of national emergency. Boys and girls were trained to use firearms and hurl grenades.|$|E

25|$|A {{call for}} {{additional}} ammunition for {{police officers in}} case of a shootout came at 12:20p.m. The killers had ceased shooting just minutes earlier. Authorities reported pipe bombs by 1:00p.m., and two SWAT teams entered the school at 1:09p.m., moving from classroom to classroom, discovering hidden students and faculty. All students, <b>teachers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> employees were taken away, questioned, and offered medical care in small holding areas before being bussed to meet with their family members at Leawood Elementary. By 3:00p.m., Dave Sanders had died of his injuries before SWAT officers could take him to get medical care. He was the only teacher to die in the shooting. Officials found the bodies in the library by 3:30p.m.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{students}} were evacuated to the countryside, {{or at least to}} towns outside of the larger and more industrialized cities, many students went to work in factories where unskilled labor was needed under the official “Labor Mobilization Policy” and “Student Mobilization Policy”. In most cases students were genuine volunteers who petitioned their <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> principals as a group to allow them to work in factory complexes that could accept them. Students then entered dorms near the factory complex; strict daily schedules ensured that the children woke, cleaned their quarters, ate meals, went to and from their work shifts, and had time for evening hygiene in cohorts. Parents were reluctant to protest because it was believed that the military-funded factories could provide the children with more nourishing meals and because such protests would draw the attention of the secret police and suspicions of disloyalty or subversion.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Katsuhisa Fujita, {{a retired}} teacher in Tokyo, was {{threatened}} with imprisonment and fined 200,000 yen (roughly 2,000 US dollars) {{after he was}} accused of disturbing a graduation ceremony at Itabashi High School by urging the attendees to remain seated during the playing of the anthem. At the time of Fujita's sentence, 345 teachers had been punished for refusing to take part in anthem related events, though Fujita is the only man to have been convicted in relation to it. On September 21, 2006, the Tokyo District Court ordered the Tokyo Metropolitan Government to pay compensation to the teachers who had been subjected to punishment under the directive of the Tokyo Board of Education. The then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi commented, [...] "It is a natural idea to treat the national anthem importantly". The ruling has been appealed by the Metropolitan Government. Since October 23, 2003, 410 <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> workers have been punished for refusing to stand and sing the anthem as ordered by school principals. Teachers can also be punished if their students do not stand while [...] "Kimigayo" [...] is played during school ceremonies.|$|E

2500|$|Aside from students, <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> <b>school</b> staff {{also face}} their own {{obstacles}} {{in working with}} refugee students. They have concerns {{about their ability to}} meet the mental, physical, emotional, and educational needs of students. One study of newly arrived Bantu students from Somalia in a Chicago school questioned whether schools were equipped to provide them with a quality education that met the needs of the pupils. The students were not aware of how to use pencils, which caused them to break the tips requiring frequent sharpening. Teachers may even see refugee students as different from other immigrant groups, {{as was the case with}} the Bantu pupils. Teachers may sometimes feel that their work is made harder because of the pressures to meet [...] state requirements for testing. With refugee children falling behind or struggling to catch up, it can overwhelm teachers and administrators.|$|E
