2500|$|Sodium {{chloride}} is {{the principal}} extinguishing agent in fire extinguishers (Met-L-X, Super D) used on combustible metal fires such as magnesium, potassium, sodium, and NaK alloys (Class D). Thermoplastic powder {{is added to the}} mixture, along with waterproofing (metal stearates) and anti-caking materials (tricalcium phosphate) to form the extinguishing agent. When it is applied to the fire, the salt acts like a heat sink, dissipating heat from the fire, and also forms an oxygen-excluding crust to smother the fire. The plastic additive melts and helps the crust maintain its integrity until the burning metal cools below its ignition temperature. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinguisher</b> was invented in the late 1940s as a cartridge-operated unit, although stored pressure versions are now popular.

2500|$|The soda-acid {{extinguisher}} {{was first}} patented in 1866 by Francois Carlier of France, which mixed {{a solution of}} water and sodium bicarbonate with tartaric acid, producing the propellant CO2 gas. A soda-acid extinguisher was patented in the U.S. in 1881 by Almon M. Granger. His extinguisher used the reaction between sodium bicarbonate solution and sulfuric acid to expel pressurized water onto a fire. A vial of concentrated sulfuric acid was suspended in the cylinder. Depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinguisher,</b> the vial of acid could be broken {{in one of two}} ways. One used a plunger to break the acid vial, while the second released a lead stopple that held the vial closed. Once the acid was mixed with the bicarbonate solution, carbon dioxide gas was expelled and thereby pressurized the water. [...] The pressurized water was forced from the canister through a nozzle or short length of hose.|$|E
50|$|In 1975 Chubb Fire {{launched}} their new range of extinguishers {{under the banner}} 'Seize and Squeeze'! These extinguishers, fitted with a new style of head, enabled them to be operated by simply withdrawing a pin and squeezing a lever-no matter which <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinguisher</b> in the Chubb range was being used. Previously, different operating methods were needed for different fire fighting media and the new concept ensured that training, especially where multi-purpose risks were involved, became extremely simplified, reducing the possible confusion at a critical time when immediate action is necessary to control a fire outbreak. Operating instructions were made clearer for instant response and colour codes ensured immediate identification of the right <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinguisher</b> for the appropriate risk. This range of extinguishers was launched at 'Interfire' exhibition in Olympia in July 1975 and in 1976 won the Design Council Award.|$|E
25|$|Basic service: All <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinguisher</b> {{require a}} basic {{inspection}} annually to check weight, externally validate the correct pressure, and find {{any signs of}} damage or corrosion. Cartridge extinguishers are to be opened up for internal inspection, {{and to have the}} weight of the cartridge tested. Labels must be inspected for legibility, and where possible, dip tubes, hoses and mechanisms must be tested for clear, free operation.|$|R

The extinguisher is checked that it has the correct volume and pressure of extinguishing agent, that it is within the required hydrotest and internal maintenance intervals, that it is in good condition, and that all external parts are still serviceable. Dry chemical and dry powder types may also be hit on the bottom with a rubber mallet to make sure the powder is free-flowing. After inspection, the tech will attach a new tamper seal and yearly service tag around the pin.|$|R

50|$|Air {{pressurized}} water (APW) <b>extinguishers</b> are a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> fire <b>extinguisher</b> that use ordinary water (H2O) to suppress fire. The water is propelled by ordinary air (atmosphere), pressurized in the extinguisher. They are also {{known by the}} slang term water can.

In order {{to prevent them from}} severe consequences of potential explosions, active protection systems, which use various kinds of suppressing materials, like suppressing powders and water, are increasingly widely applied [3, 4, 5, 6].

Currently, lithium ion batteries are the preferred <b>types</b> <b>of</b> batteries aboard international spacecraft and therefore are routinely installed, collectively forming a potentially devastating fire threat to a spacecraft and its crew.

Only one <b>of</b> each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> equipment can be equipped at once. Primary equipment consists of an oxygen mask and tank and three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> fire <b>extinguishers</b> that correspond to the different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> fires that can be encountered in the game; regular, chemical, and electrical. These fires and their extinguishers are red-orange, green, and blue, respectively. As these are used, a counter goes from 99 to 0. The counter <b>of</b> the regular <b>extinguisher</b> rapidly increases back to 99 after {{a brief period of}} inactivity, while the oxygen tank and mask and the other extinguishers can only go back to 99 after being resupplied by allies in the level. Secondary equipment consists of a trusty fireman's axe, a rope for crossing gaps, a metal pole to reveal holes by checking for weak places in the floor, plastic explosives to blow through debris and certain wall sections, and CO2 bombs to extinguish large areas of fire. Only five plastic explosives and CO2 bombs can be carried at one time and can be replenished by an ally on the map.|$|R

Carbon tetrachloride was suitable for liquid and electrical fires and the extinguishers were fitted to motor vehicles. Carbon tetrachloride extinguishers were withdrawn in the 1950s because of the chemical's toxicity – exposure to high concentrations damages the nervous system and internal organs. Additionally, when used on a fire, the heat can convert CTC to phosgene gas, formerly used as a chemical weapon.|$|R
