5|$|After Libyan {{intelligence}} operatives {{were charged}} with the Lockerbie bombing, Gaddafi tried <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from terrorism. Abu Nidal was expelled from Libya in 1999, and in 2002 he returned to Iraq. The Iraqi government later said he had entered the country using a fake Yemeni passport and false name.|$|E
5|$|The robbery {{also made}} the Bolshevik Centre unpopular more widely among European social democrat groups. Lenin's desire <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from {{the legacy of the}} robbery may {{have been one of the}} sources of the rift between him and Bogdanov and Krasin. Stalin distanced himself from Kamo's gang and never publicized his role in the robbery.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they were}} still allies, San Martín began <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from Alvear, who {{controlled}} the Assembly and the lodge. Alvear opposed the merchants and the Uruguayan caudillo José Gervasio Artigas, San Martín {{thought that it was}} risky to open such conflicts when the royalists were still a threat. The Army of the North, which was operating at the Upper Peru, was defeated at the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, so the triumvirate appointed San Martín to head it, replacing Manuel Belgrano.|$|E

In one of his delusions, Shogun appears as an old man in a wheelchair and tells him that more people will die unless he wakes up.|$|E
5|$|Gilmour had {{recorded}} his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, {{and he used}} it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels {{was educated}} at a Christian Gymnasium, where he {{completed}} his Abitur (university entrance examination) in 1917. He {{was the top}} student of his class and was given the traditional honor {{to speak at the}} awards ceremony. His parents initially hoped that he would become a Catholic priest, and Goebbels seriously considered it. He studied literature and history at the universities of Bonn, Würzburg, Freiburg, and Munich, aided by a scholarship from the Albertus Magnus Society. By this time Goebbels had begun <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from the church.|$|E
50|$|Despite his sympathies for the Fenian movement, Boyle, {{through his}} paper, opposed any Irish {{invasion}} of Canada. His failure <b>to</b> fully <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from the movement {{led to a}} break between him and Irish-Canadians headed by Thomas D'Arcy McGee, James George Moylan, and Archbishop John Joseph Lynch.|$|R
500|$|The King's Speech {{from the}} Throne on 21 February made {{reference}} to introducing measures restricting the Lords' power of veto to one of delay, but Asquith inserted a phrase [...] "in the opinion of my advisers" [...] so the King could be seen <b>to</b> be <b>distancing</b> <b>himself</b> from the planned legislation.|$|R

5|$|In 1998, Griffin {{was convicted}} of distributing {{material}} likely to incite racial hatred, for which he received a suspended prison sentence. In 2006 he was acquitted of separate charges of inciting racial hatred. Griffin has been criticised for many of his comments on political, social, ethical and religious matters, but after becoming leader of the BNP he sought <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from some of his previously held positions, which include Holocaust denial. In recent years, events where Griffin has been {{invited to participate in}} public debates or political discussions have proven controversial and often resulted in protests and cancellations.|$|E
5|$|Isolated {{inside the}} Tower, the royal {{government}} {{was in a}} state of shock at the turn of events. The King left the castle that morning and made his way to negotiate with the rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him. The King left Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety or because Richard had decided it would be safer <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from his unpopular ministers. Along the way, several Londoners accosted the King to complain about alleged injustices.|$|E
5|$|O'Malley {{initially}} supported Bell's candidacy. Bell urged O'Malley {{to endorse}} him, and offered him {{the job of}} city solicitor {{in exchange for his}} support. However, O'Malley began <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from Bell, not appearing at Bell's campaign announcement, due to disagreements on several bills debated at the City Council. Bell's supporters attempted to convince O'Malley to run for City Council President, but O'Malley announced his decision to run for mayor in June, becoming the first major candidate in the race who was Caucasian. He began the campaign largely unknown outside of Northeast Baltimore.|$|E
50|$|A palace {{was built}} for him at Fukuhara, and Kiyomori also oversaw {{considerable}} improvements to the harbor there, to further his wider goals of expanding trade within the Inland Sea.

50|$|Ziemomysł {{recovered}} his lands only in 1278 as {{a result}} of an agreement between Bolesław the Pious and Leszek II the Black in Ląd, where Leszek II returned Inowrocław to his brother only after he promised <b>to</b> take <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from all his German advisors.

5000|$|When Paul VI {{confirmed}} the Catholic Church's total rejection {{of birth control}} by [...] "artificial methods" [...] in his Humanae vitae in 1968, Peeters was greatly disappointed and angry.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his time}} at the college Ketèlbey wrote lighter, mostly mandolin-based, compositions. As he still aspired to be a serious composer, he adapted the {{pseudonym}} Raoul Clifford in an effort <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from the genre. On leaving the college he became one of its examiners in harmony. He wrote piano pieces as part of his role, and used the pseudonym Anton Vodorinski for the work; he subsequently used the name for more serious works, which he published with French titles.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} {{it has caused}} for his family, Gregor finds it hard <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from the Underland. When he receives word that a plague has broken out and his bond Ares {{is one of the}} victims, he heads down to help with yet another of Bartholomew of Sandwich's prophecies. His mother, however, hates the Underland and only allows Boots and Gregor below on the condition that she comes with them. The humans' plague expert, Dr. Neveeve, explains that there is a plant called starshade growing deep in the Vineyard of Eyes which can be distilled into a cure. In the midst of the meeting, a dying bat infected with the plague inadvertently one of the delegates—Gregor's mother.|$|E
5|$|Discontent with Richard's actions {{manifested}} itself in the summer after he {{took control of the}} country, as a conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper. Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son as a candidate for the throne. The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke's motive in joining the plot, although historian Charles Ross proposes that Buckingham was trying <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people. Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king.|$|E
50|$|As {{time went}} by and Ivo Sanader's {{policies}} became less popular, and there were apparent setbacks for Croatia's prospects for entry into the EU, so Glavaš began <b>to</b> publicly <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from Sanader. Glavaš expressed Euroscepticism with regard to how the EU would handle the Croatian accession negotiations, and was critical towards the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).|$|R

5|$|During Jean-Marie Le Pen's presidency, {{the party}} has also been active in {{establishing}} extra-parliamentary confederations. During the FN's 1997 national congress, the FN established the loose Euronat group, which consisted {{of a variety of}} European right-wing parties. Having failed to cooperate in the European Parliament, Le Pen sought in the mid-1990s to initiate contacts with other far-right parties, including from non-EU countries. The FN drew most support in Central and Eastern Europe, and Le Pen visited the Turkish Welfare Party. The significant Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) refused to join the efforts, as Jörg Haider sought <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from Le Pen, and later attempted to build a separate group. In 2009, the FN joined the Alliance of European National Movements; it left the alliance since. Along with some other European parties, the FN in 2010 visited Japan's Issuikai ("right-wing") movement and the Yasukuni Shrine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Coca-Cola wanted Selena {{to become one}} of their spokespeople in Texas. The jingle used in her first two {{commercials}} for the company were composed by A.B. and Chris Pérez—the latter of whom had joined Selena y Los Dinos several months earlier as the band's new guitarist. Pérez began having romantic feelings for Selena, despite having a girlfriend in San Antonio. After a trip down to Mexico with the band, Pérez thought it would be best for them both <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from her, but he found that impossible and chose to try to build a relationship with her. They expressed their feelings for each other at a Pizza Hut restaurant, and shortly afterwards became a couple. Pérez and Selena hid their relationship, fearing Quintanilla, Jr. would try to break it up.|$|E
5|$|Jameson did {{not regard}} this {{ambiguity}} as a proper answer, and impatiently waited for further {{word from the}} king. After standing by for the specified two days and receiving nothing, he correctly concluded that Lobengula was stalling him, and using the extra time <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from his former capital. Jameson therefore made good on his pledge, and called for volunteers; he assembled a host of about 470 men, mixed together from the Mashonaland Mounted Police, the Bechuanaland Border Police, and Raaff's Rangers, an independent unit led by the eponymous Commandant Piet Raaff. This force was placed under Forbes's command, with three Maxim guns attached. Jameson told the major to scout the area between Shiloh and Inyati for spoor, with the ultimate objective of capturing Lobengula, and sent him out just before sunset on 14 November 1893.|$|E

5000|$|Gabrielle 'Gabbe' Givens - Gabbe {{is a very}} {{beautiful}} and graceful fallen angel at the school. Luce dislikes Gabbe at first because she believes that she is dating Daniel, though Gabbe is unerringly gracious towards her and is {{actually one of the}} few people telling Daniel <b>to</b> stop <b>distancing</b> <b>himself</b> from Luce. She has the stereo-typical angelic appearance and is describes as having a southern accent. She chose to side with God.|$|R
5|$|One of Metternich's first tasks was to {{push for}} the {{marriage}} of Napoleon to Archduchess Marie Louise {{rather than to the}} Tsar's youngest sister Anna Pavlovna. Metternich would later seek <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from the marriage by claiming it was Napoleon's own idea, but this is improbable; in any case, he was happy to claim responsibility at the time. By 7 February Napoleon had agreed and the pair were married by proxy on 11 March. Marie Louise left for France soon after and Metternich followed by a different route and unofficially. The trip was designed, Metternich explained, to transport his family (stranded in France by the outbreak of war) home and to report to the Austrian Emperor about Marie Louise's activities.|$|E
5|$|The Peasants' Revolt {{became a}} popular {{literary}} subject. The poet John Gower, who had {{close ties to}} officials involved in {{the suppression of the}} revolt, amended his famous poem Vox Clamantis after the revolt, inserting a section condemning the rebels and likening them to wild animals. Geoffrey Chaucer, who lived in Aldgate and may have been in London during the revolt, used the rebel killing of Flemings as a metaphor for wider disorder in The Nun's Priest's Tale part of The Canterbury Tales, parodying Gower's poem. Chaucer otherwise made no reference to the revolt in his work, possibly because as he was a client of the King it would have been politically unwise to discuss it. William Langland, the author of the poem Piers Plowman, which had been widely used by the rebels, made various changes to its text after the revolt in order <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from their cause.|$|E
5|$|The harder line now {{developing}} in Russian politics led Quisling <b>to</b> <b>distance</b> <b>himself</b> from Bolshevism. The Soviet government had rejected outright his Armenian proposals, and obstructed {{an attempt by}} Nansen {{to help with the}} 1928 Ukrainian famine. Quisling took these rebuffs as a personal insult; in 1929, with the British now keen to take back control of their own diplomatic affairs, he left Russia. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to Britain, an honour revoked by King George VI in 1940. By this time, Quisling had also been awarded the Romanian Crown Order and the Yugoslav Order of St. Sava for his earlier humanitarian efforts.|$|E

5000|$|Chris premieres {{his film}} Cleaver {{at a private}} {{screening}} with other Soprano associates, looking to having it distributed nationwide. He also tries <b>to</b> <b>distances</b> <b>himself</b> from the criminal lifestyle and stays away from the Bada Bing. When Tony begins grooming Bobby Bacala for the position Chris once held, {{it is clear that}} their relationship has cooled. Given Chris' resentment towards Tony about Adriana's death, and his continued desire to enter the film business, the two continue to drift apart. When he relapses to drinking after yet another confrontation with Paulie, he becomes very angry with the crew and leaves. He later ends up at his [...] "friend" [...] J.T. Dolan's home, looking for someone to talk to. When J.T. foolishly made explicit mention of Chris' membership in the Mafia, and refuses to let Chris talk out his problems that night, Chris shoots him in the head and leaves.|$|R
