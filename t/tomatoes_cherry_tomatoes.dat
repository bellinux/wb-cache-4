40|$|In {{this paper}} a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of {{protected}} crops was carried out. In particular, {{energy and environmental}} performances of peppers, melons, <b>tomatoes,</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes</b> and zucchini in different typologies of greenhouses (tunnel and pavilion) were assessed. The study aimed at assessing the eco-profile of each product and the share of each lify-cycle step on the total environmental impacts. The related process flow chart, the relevant mass and energy flows and the key environmental issues were identified for each product. Collection of primary data was conducted {{by means of a}} detailed questionnaire distributed to a producer company in southern Italy. The analysis was developed according to the LCA standards of the ISO 14040 series. The results showed that for all the examined vegetables the packaging step and the greehouse structures have a relevant share in the environmental impact distribution. Further tunnel and pavilion greenhouses are characterized by comparable ecoprofiles and both of them are characterized by lower energy consumptions than greenhouses in the North of Europe, due to the non-use of auxiliary heating systems in the former...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) {{methodology}} {{was applied to}} evaluate the energy consumption and environmental burdens associated with the production of protected crops in an agricultural district in the Mediterranean region. In this study, LCA {{was used as a}} ‘support tool’, to address local policies for sustainable production and consumption patterns, and to create a ‘knowledge base’ for environmental assessment of an extended agricultural production area. The proposed approach combines organisation-specific tools, such as Environmental Management Systems and Environmental Product Declarations, with the environmental management of the district. Questionnaires were distributed to producers to determine the life cycle of different protected crops (<b>tomatoes,</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> peppers, melons and zucchinis), and obtain information on greenhouse usage (e. g. tunnel vs. pavilion). Ecoprofiles of products in the district were also estimated, to identify supply chain elements with the highest impact in terms of global energy requirements, greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication, water consumption and waste production. These results of this study enable selection of the ‘best practices’ and ecodesign solutions, to reduce the environmental impact of these products. Finally, sensitivity analysis of key LCA issues was performed, to assess the variability associated with different parameters: vegetable production; water usage; fertiliser and pesticide usage; shared greenhouse use; substitution of plastics coverings; and waste recycling...|$|E

The average yield was 28, 500 pounds (14. 25 tons) per acre (10). ● The average price paid for packed and loaded fresh tomatoes in 1997 was $ 0. 27 per pound. The total cash value of the 1997 crop was $ 313, 956, 000 (10). This would equate to an average cash value (gross) of $ 7, 695 per acre.

Host plants tested for T. evansi were <b>tomato,</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>tomato,</b> eggplant, nightshade, and pepper while host plants tested for T. urticae were strawberry, jack bean, cotton and Gerbera. Oviposition rate of the mites on each plant was determined to infer host plant suitability while host-switching determined antibiosis effect on fungal activity. T. evansi had a high oviposition on eggplant, tomato and nightshade but not on <b>cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> and pepper. T. urticae on jack bean resulted in a higher oviposition than on strawberry, cotton and Gerbera. Attachment of capilliconidia to the T. evansi body, presence of hyphal bodies in infected T. evansi and mortality from fungal infection were significantly higher on pepper, nightshade and tomato. The highest level of T. evansi mummification was observed on tomato.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of ultrasound treatment combined with commercial sanitizers in the decontamination step of minimally processed <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> Previously selected <b>cherry</b> <b>tomatoes</b> were treated with ultrasound (45 kHz) for 10 min in the presence of 20 and 200 mg/L sodium dichloroisocyanurate, 5 % hydrogen peroxide, 10 mg/L chlorine dioxide or 40 mg/L peracetic acid.

40|$|Tomato {{production}} in the Republic of Macedonia is present on more than 5700 hectares, being the leading vegetable crop {{in the region of}} Strumica. <b>Cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> however, is poorly present at our fields, mainly due to the traditional habits of the consumers and the commercial tomato producers to grow tomato varieties with large fruit. <b>Cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> - Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. var. cerasiforme (Dunal) is a tomato variety with small fruit, with different shapes and colors and it is used mainly for fresh consumption. The characteristic of this variety are its sweetness and aroma, which further enriches the taste of food. During this research, a comparative analysis of the morphological traits in this type of tomato in outdoor production conditions and in protected environment was done. The possibilities for production and maintenance in plant cell cultutre were researched as well, with the goal of future improving the morphological and biological features of <b>cherry</b> <b>tomato.</b> The characterization and comparative evaluation of the genotypes was done according to the modified descriptors for tomato of Bioversity International (formerly International Plant Genetic Resources Institute-IPGRI).

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the digitization and visualization of potted greenhouse tomato plants in indoor environments. For the digitization, an inexpensive and efficient commercial stereo sensor—a Microsoft Kinect—is used to separate visual information about tomato plants from background. Based on the Kinect, a 4 -step approach that can automatically detect and segment stems of tomato plants is proposed, including acquisition and preprocessing of image data, detection of stem segments, removing false detections and automatic segmentation of stem segments. Correctly segmented texture samples including stems and leaves are then stored in a texture database for further usage. Two types of <b>tomato</b> plants—the <b>cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> variety and the ordinary variety are studied in this paper. The stem detection accuracy (under a simulated greenhouse environment) for the <b>cherry</b> <b>tomato</b> variety is 98. 4 % at a true positive rate of 78. 0 %, whereas the detection accuracy for the ordinary variety is 94. 5 % at a true positive of 72. 5 %. In visualization, we combine L-system theory and digitized tomato organ texture data to build realistic 3 D virtual tomato plant models that are capable of exhibiting various structures and poses in real time. In particular, we also simulate the growth process on virtual tomato plants by exerting controls on two L-systems via parameters concerning the age and the form of lateral branches. This research may provide useful visual cues for improving intelligent greenhouse control systems and meanwhile may facilitate research on artificial organisms...|$|R
