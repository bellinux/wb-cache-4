50|$|Silicon wafers are {{cut from}} a solid ingot of nearly-pure (99.9999999%) silicon. This is done {{through the process of}} Czochralski growth, which is diagramed in the image on the right, and {{produces}} a single intact diamond cubic silicon crystal. Due to its structure, monocrystalline silicon is anisotropic, which gives it different structural and electrical properties in different plane directions. Using miller indexes to denote the different plane orientations, the (1,0,0) and the (1,1,1) faces are typically used in silicon wafers (see image). The silicon ingot is oriented and cut along one these planes to expose that surface for processing through photolithography. The reason to use either of these planar faces depends on the application for which the silicon wafer will be used, or how it will be processed. At any rate, <b>this</b> <b>depends</b> <b>of</b> the use of etchants, photoresist, and acids to treat the surface, and the chemical interactions of these chemicals with the crystal surface depends on the surface properties of that crystalline face.
