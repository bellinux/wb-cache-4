60|$|He fooled Daylight completely. At {{the end of}} {{half an hour of}} goodness, Daylight, lured into confidence, {{was riding}} along at a walk and rolling a cigarette, with slack knees and relaxed seat, the reins lying on the animal's neck. Bob whirled {{abruptly}} and with lightning swiftness, pivoting on his hind legs, his fore legs just lifted clear of the ground. Daylight found himself with his right foot out of the stirrup and his arms around the animal's neck; and Bob took advantage of the situation <b>to</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> the road. With a hope that he should not encounter Dede Mason at that moment, Daylight regained his seat and checked in the horse.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we did pretend {{as well as}} we could; but {{everybody}} hugged the port side o’ the ship, and was ready <b>to</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> below at the shortest notice; and at last, when the beast got craning its neck up over the side as though it was looking for something, we gave it some more grub. We thought if we didn’t give it he might take it, and take it off the wrong shelf, so to speak. But, as the mate said, it was encouraging it, and long arter it was dark we could hear it snorting and splashing behind us, until at last it ’ad such an effect on us the mate sent one o’ the chaps down to rouse the skipper.|$|E
60|$|Though {{amid all}} the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship's decks, like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved, ready <b>to</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> every killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other's live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away under {{the table at the}} dead meat; and though, were you to turn the whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing, that is to say, a {{shocking}} sharkish business enough for all parties; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or two other like instances might be set down, touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea. If you have never seen that sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of devil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the devil.|$|E
50|$|An {{optical bench}} or optical rail is a simpler piece of {{hardware}} that provides a linear (or sometimes curved) track along which to mount optical elements. They are often used for simple experiments, especially for classroom demonstrations. Such rails are typically made of steel and designed to be very stiff, with features that allow holders for optical components <b>to</b> be <b>bolted</b> <b>down</b> and easily shifted {{along the length of}} the rail.|$|R
5000|$|Modern optical {{tables are}} {{typically}} made of {{top and bottom}} sheets of steel, aluminum, or carbon fiber, separated by a thick honeycomb lattice structure. The surface usually has a grid of threaded holes which allow the components <b>to</b> be <b>bolted</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> fit the optical system layout. Components may also be held to the steel surface by magnetic bases. Often, the table's legs are pneumatic vibration dampers. For even more accurate setups, one also prevents air movements and temperature gradients by enclosing the surface in a box of transparent plastic such as Plexiglas. One may also use a [...] "flowbox", a device which produces a laminar stream of air flowing downwards, kept at constant temperature by special air conditioning.|$|R
2500|$|Barton's design {{called for}} a spherical vessel, as a sphere is the best {{possible}} shape for resisting high pressure. [...] The sphere had openings for three [...] windows made of fused quartz, the strongest transparent material then available, as well a 400-pound/181.436 kilogram entrance hatch which was <b>to</b> be <b>bolted</b> <b>down</b> before a descent. [...] Initially {{only two of the}} windows were mounted on the sphere, and a steel plug was mounted in place of the third window. [...] Oxygen was supplied from high-pressure cylinders carried inside the sphere, while pans of soda lime and calcium chloride were mounted inside the sphere's walls to absorb exhaled CO2 and moisture. [...] Air was to be circulated past these trays by the Bathysphere's occupants using palm-leaf fans.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{ran like}} a buck, still keeping {{hold of my}} gun, however. My idea, so far as I {{could be said to}} have any fixed idea, was <b>to</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> the pathway up which I had come, like a rabbit down a burrow, trusting that he would lose sight of me in the {{uncertain}} light. I sped across the glade. Fortunately the bull, being wounded, could not go full speed; but wounded or no, he could go quite as fast as I could. I was unable to gain an inch, and away we went, with just about three feet between our separate extremities. We were at the other side now, and a glance served to show me that I had miscalculated and overshot the opening. To reach it now was hopeless; I should have blundered straight into the elephant. So I did the only thing I could do: I swerved like a course hare, and started off round the edge of the glade, seeking for some opening into which I could plunge. This gave me a moment's start, for the bull could not turn as quickly as I could, and I made the most of it. But no opening could I see; the bush was like a wall. We were speeding round the edge of the glade, and the elephant was coming up again. Now he was within about six feet, and now, as he trumpeted or rather screamed, I could feel the fierce hot blast of his breath strike upon my head. Heavens! how it frightened me! ...|$|E
5000|$|July 13, 1882: In Plumas County, {{the stage}} from La Porte to Oroville. This stage {{was loaded with}} gold and George Hackett was armed. Bart lost his derby as he fled the scene when it was {{determined}} that the Wells Fargo agent in LaPorte had supplied hardware <b>to</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> the strongbox. His derby was traced to him eventually through the laundry mark. The same stage was again held-up in Forbestown and Hackett blasted the would-be robber into the bushes. This was mistakenly blamed on Bart.|$|E
50|$|The pair {{then began}} {{some of the}} get-ahead tasks mission {{managers}} had hoped to complete. The two spacewalkers installed a computer network cable on the Unity node that was to permit astronauts in the U.S. segment of the station to command systems in the Russian segment and opened the Hydrogen vent valve on the Destiny laboratory installed by Mission Specialist James Reilly during EVA 3. Swanson and Forrester also attempted <b>to</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> two debris shield panels {{that could not be}} put back in place during an earlier spacewalk. since the two were also not able to get it anchored, they tethered the panels on the space station's service module.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{development}} of the horizontal stationary engine in the mid 19th century, the requirements were no longer to support a single heavy beam but now to provide accurate alignment between the cylinders and crankshaft of a medium-speed engine. These foundations were substantial, going down perhaps three-dozen courses of brickwork below the engine bed. Deep iron anchors were provided within the brickwork for the engine <b>to</b> be <b>bolted</b> <b>down.</b> Rough local stone was no longer rigid enough and so foundations were constructed of many layers of hard engineering brick, as this was cheaper and more easily available than a cut ashlar stone of equal rigidity. As these engine ran at faster speeds than the beam engines, their vibration could also be higher requiring a foundation that could withstand such. Alignment between slideways and crankshaft depended upon the original care with which the foundation had been built.|$|R
50|$|When Circe {{called upon}} her unseen lover for aid, a {{powerful}} {{bolt of lightning}} {{came down from the}} sky. Wonder Woman used both her bracelets to deflect the lightning, but they were fused together. As she had just had her bracelets bound by a man, she was rendered powerless until she persuaded Griggs, trapped {{in the form of a}} ram/man hybrid, to charge her and use the force of his collision to break the bracelets apart. Wonder Woman deflected more lightning bolts, unwittingly sending the fiery <b>bolts</b> <b>to</b> burn <b>down</b> Circe's patch of immortality-granting herbs. Tezcatlipoca then imprisoned Circe in his obsidian mirror, turned Wonder Woman into a powerless Diana Prince, and revealed himself.|$|R

50|$|The sleepers, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} bi-bloc sleepers, are U41 twin block reinforced concrete, 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in.) wide, and weigh 245 kg (540 lb) each. They {{are equipped with}} hardware for Nabla RNTC spring fasteners, and a 9 mm (3/8 in.) rubber pad. (Rubber pads are always used under the rail on concrete sleepers, to avoid cracking). Next, a rail threader is used to lift the rails onto their final position on the sleepers. This machine rides on the rails just like the gantry cranes, but can also support itself directly on a sleeper. By doing this, it can lift the rails, and shift them inwards over {{the ends of the}} sleepers, to the proper gauge (standard gauge). It then lowers them onto the rubber sleeper cushions, and workers use a pneumatically operated machine <b>to</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> the Nabla clips with a predetermined torque. The rails are canted inward at a slope of 1 in 20.|$|E
50|$|Just {{before the}} start of Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign in the spring of 1864, Kilpatrick {{conducted}} a raid toward Richmond and through the Virginia Peninsula, hoping to rescue Union prisoners of war held at Belle Isle and in Libby Prisons in Richmond. Kilpatrick took his division out on February 28, sneaking past Robert E. Lee's flank and driving south for Richmond. On March 1, they were within 5 miles of the city. Defenses around the city were too strong however and numerous squads of Confederate militia and cavalry nipped at their heels the whole way, including some of General Wade Hampton's troopers dispatched from the Army of Northern Virginia. Unable to get at Richmond or return to the Army of the Potomac, Kilpatrick decided <b>to</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> the Virginia Peninsula where Ben Butler's Army of the James was stationed. Meanwhile, the general was dismayed to find out that Ulric Dahlgren's brigade (detached from the main force) had not made it across the James River. Eventually 300 of the latter's troopers stumbled into camp, Dahlgren and the rest seemingly vanished into thin air. The survivors reported that they'd made a nightmarish journey through the countryside around Richmond in darkness and a sleet storm, the woods filled with enemy troops and hostile civilians at every turn. Dahlgren and the 200 cavalrymen he was accompanying had been told by a slave of a place where the James was shallow and could be forded. When they got there, the river was swelled up and cresting. Convinced he'd been tricked, Dahlgren ordered the slave hanged. They went back north and found that Kilpatrick was gone and they were alone in a hostile country. The troopers battled their way to the Mattaponi River, crossed, and appeared to be safe from danger, but in the dark they ran into a Confederate ambush. Dahlghren was shot dead along with many of his men, the rest being taken prisoner. His body was then displayed in Richmond as a war trophy. Papers found on the body of Dahlgren shortly after his death which described the object of the expedition, and they were apparently altered to read that he wanted to burn and loot Richmond and assassinate Jefferson Davis and the whole Confederate cabinet.|$|E

50|$|A {{torque to}} yield {{fastener}} (TTY) is mounting hardware {{in the form}} of a fastener which is torqued beyond the state of elasticity and therefore undergoes plastic deformation, causing it to become permanently elongated. Torquing a fastener to yield results in a high preloading of the fastener which, depending on the load frequency and amplitude, can significantly increase the fatigue life of the fastener. When the applied load doesn't surpass the clamping force of the fastener, the strain of the fastener will be lower than when the preloading is smaller than the applied load. It is therefore beneficial in high-frequency high-load situations with a higher risk of fatigue related failure, like a <b>bolted</b> <b>down</b> cylinder head, <b>to</b> use torque <b>to</b> yield <b>bolts.</b>|$|R
50|$|More {{than a year}} later, {{the second}} test took place {{a few days after}} President Kennedy's assassination. The {{redesigned}} Centaur stage functioned without any problems and performed a single burn to geosynchronous orbit, where it remains today. Because the problem of jettisoning the insulation panels had still not been solved, Abe Silverstein ordered them simply <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> the side of the Centaur. Vibration data obtained during the flight also proved that the panels would have failed {{in a manner similar to}} AC-1 had they not been <b>bolted</b> <b>down.</b> The ultimate fix to the panel problem added more weight to Centaur, further dropping its payload capacity.|$|R
