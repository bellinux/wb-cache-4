25|$|During the 1950s {{there were}} many {{attempts}} to design aircraft that could fly conventionally after a vertical take-off and then land vertically. As the thrust-to-weight ratio of turbojet engines increased sufficiently for a single engine be able to lift an aircraft, designers began to investigate ways of maintaining stability. Beginning in 1956, the French engine manufacturer SNECMA built a series of wingless <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> called the Atar Volant, as precursors to a winged aircraft. Only {{the first of these}} was unpiloted and the second flew freely, both stabilized by gas jets on outrigger pipes. The third had a tilting seat to allow the pilot to sit upright when the fuselage was level and had the lateral air intakes planned for the free flying aircraft, though it always operated attached to a movable cradle. The pilot for these experiments was Auguste Morel.|$|E

500|$|As the Comet {{represented}} {{a new category}} of passenger aircraft, more rigorous testing was a development priority. From 1947 to 1948, de Havilland conducted an extensive research and development phase, {{including the use of}} several stress <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> at Hatfield for small components and large assemblies alike. Sections of pressurised fuselage were subjected to high-altitude flight conditions via a large decompression chamber on-site, and tested to failure. However, tracing fuselage failure points proved difficult with this method, and de Havilland ultimately switched to conducting structural tests with a water tank that could be safely configured to increase pressures gradually. The entire forward fuselage section was tested for metal fatigue by repeatedly pressurising to [...] overpressure and depressurising through more than 16,000 cycles, equivalent to about 40,000hours of airline service. [...] The windows were also tested under a pressure of , [...] above expected pressures at the normal service ceiling of [...] One window frame survived , about 1,250 percent over the maximum pressure it was expected to encounter in service.|$|E
500|$|With Sinclair's new {{specifications}} in hand, Ogle {{worked on}} a three-wheeled design dubbed the C5, which bore similarities with the earlier three-wheeled Bond Bug – another Ogle design. The vehicle's handlebar steering {{was the brainchild of}} Wood Rogers, who decided at the outset that a steering wheel would not be practicable as it would make it impossible for a driver {{to get in and out}} easily – a serious safety disadvantage. He comments that [...] "putting the bars at the driver's sides made it easy to steer and felt very natural". A prototype was presented to 63 families in the A, B, C1 and C2 demographic groups in suburban and town environments to determine that the controls were correctly positioned; this was the only external research carried out on the C5. In the autumn of 1983, Wills brought in Lotus Cars to finish the vehicle's detailing, build prototypes and <b>test</b> <b>rigs,</b> carry out testing and take forward the programme to production. The development of the C5 took place over 19 months in conditions of great secrecy, with testing carried out at the Motor Industry Research Association's proving ground in Leicestershire.|$|E

2500|$|Production {{aircraft}} were {{powered by}} various {{models of the}} Rolls-Royce Avon engine. This power-plant was initially rated as capable of generating [...] of dry thrust, but when employing the four-stage afterburner this increased to a maximum thrust of [...] Later models of the Avon would feature, in addition to increased thrust, a full-variable reheat arrangement. A special heat-reflecting paint containing gold was used to protect the aircraft's structure from the hot engine casing which could reach temperatures of 600°C. Under optimum conditions, a well-equipped maintenance facility would take four hours to perform an engine change so specialised ground <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> were developed to speed up maintenance and remove the need to perform a full ground run of the engine after some maintenance tasks. The stacked engine configuration complicated maintenance work, and the leakage of fluid from the upper engine was a recurring fire hazard. The fire risk was reduced, but not eliminated, following remedial work during development. For removal the lower No.1 engine was removed from below the aircraft, after removal of the ventral tank and lower fuselage access panels, by lowering the engine down, while the upper No.2 engine was lifted out from above via removable sections in the fuselage top.|$|E
