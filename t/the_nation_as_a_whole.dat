5|$|Yarralumla is a {{comparatively}} wealthy suburb with a 2016 median weekly personal income of $1,347; this compares to an ACT-wide figure of $998 and an Australia-wide figure of $662. The public service or defence force employed around 21.7% of the workforce, somewhat {{less than the}} ACT average of 23.6%. This compared to 1.9% for Australia as a whole. The higher incomes were derived from the suburb's white-collar base; 63.5% of Yarralumla's workforce was employed as professionals or in managerial posts, compared to 35.2% nationally. In contrast, only 3.4% were engaged in blue-collar occupations, compared with 15.8% for <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> The {{proportion of the population}} working as tradesmen and technicians was almost four times lower than average across Australia.|$|E

5|$|Financially the Militia was {{neglected}} also. Despite the upturn in {{the economic}} situation in the early 1930s there was little financial respite for the Militia in this time. As the situation continued to improve, however, the defence vote was increased steadily after 1935. Indeed, in 1938 the government decided to double {{the strength of the}} Militia as war clouds began to loom on the horizon, and late in the year a recruiting campaign was launched that saw the size of the Militia increase from 35,000 to 43,000 men over the space of three months. This trend continued into 1939 and by midway through the year there were over 80,000 men serving on a part-time voluntary basis. Nevertheless, there was a serious shortage of equipment and as a result, when World War II broke out in September 1939 the Militia was by no means an effective fighting force and <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> was not as well prepared for war as it had been in 1914.|$|E

5000|$|National mysticism (German Nationalmystik) {{is a form}} of {{nationalism}} which raises <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> to <b>the</b> status of numen or divinity.

The idea of <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> divine entity was presented by Johann Gottlieb Fichte. National mysticism is closely related to Romantic nationalism, but goes beyond the expounding of romantic sentiment, to a mystical veneration of <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> transcendent truth.

25|$|White {{concludes with}} a mixed verdict. The transcontinentals did open up the West to settlement, brought in many {{thousands}} of high-tech, highly paid workers and managers, created thousands of towns and cities, oriented the nation onto an east–west axis, and proved highly valuable for <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> On the other hand, too many were built, and they were built too far ahead of actual demand. The result was a bubble that left heavy losses to investors, and led to poor management practices. By contrast, as White notes, the lines in the Midwest and East supported by a very large population base, fostered farming, industry and mining while generating steady profits and receiving few government benefits.|$|E

25|$|Motivations {{behind the}} {{volunteering}} nature were not solely patriotic, but also commonly economic. Many men who joined as volunteers {{and went on}} to serve with the regular army were unemployed urban dwellers, and prospects of a standard income were better than none at all. Tradesmen could be sure to make a tidy profit from selling their wares to the soldiers, and sutlers often became camp followers, following a regiment, whilst on campaign. Certainly more applicable to the landed and wealthy gentlemen, fears of invasion also persuaded many to serve; not so much to support <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> but to preserve their own interests, money and property which could be lost if the enemy succeeded.|$|E
