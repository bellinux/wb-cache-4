50|$|The {{life cycle}} of the {{subdivision}} is dimorphic and it consists of two phases in the life cycle. One saprobic haploid phase and a parasitic (biotrophic) dikaryotic phase.The saprobic phase is initiated by the production of haploid yeasts, which fuses with another spore and produce the n+n hyphae which will infect the host. The infection happens with {{the production of a}} structure called appressoria, which is a specialized cell that is used to penetrate the host cuticle. Inside the host, the fungi will produce hyphae and another specialized structure called haustoria. This will take nutrition from the plant, and is a parasitic feature. Almost all of the Ustilaginomycotina will then sporulate inside the host, and this happens with the spore becoming thick-walled and will separate, now called a <b>teliospore.</b> The <b>teliospore</b> is the most conspicuous part of the individual and represent the smut syndrome.

50|$|Infection of {{the wheat}} occurs during {{germination}} {{of the plant}} seed and is favored by cool, wet conditions. Optimum conditions for spore germination are soil temperatures {{in the range of}} 5-15 °C (41-59 °F). Bunt fungi overwinter as dikaryotic <b>teliospores</b> typically on seed and occasionally in soil. The fungus infects the shoots of wheat seedlings before the plants emerge from the soil. After karyogamy, the <b>teliospores</b> germinate to form a basidium, on which 8-16 haploid basidiospores (primary sporidia) will develop. There are two mating types of basidiospores (+ and -) and they fuse to form H-shaped structures to establish a dikaryon. This dikaryon then will yield infectious hyphae which can either produce more hyphae or more secondary sporidia. The pathogen grows within the terminal meristem via mycelium and completes its life cycle by transforming the mycelial cells into <b>teliospores.</b> The smutted wheat kernels that are full of <b>teliospores</b> break open and release upon harvest, which allows for the <b>teliospores</b> to overwinter on the seed and are blown away by currents onto the soil, thus completing the life cycle.|$|R

40|$|The European Commission {{requested}} EFSA {{to provide}} a scientific opinion on the USDA APHIS quantitative pathway analysis on likelihood of Karnal bunt introduction with importation of US wheat for grain into EU and desert durum wheat for grain into Italy. EFSA was also requested to indicate whether the US bunted kernel standard would provide equivalent protection against introduction of Tilletia indica into EU, compared to the existing EU import requirement. The Panel on Plant Health reviewed pathway scenarios, model and parameters and found several shortcomings regarding model equations and parameter values, particularly a lack of scientific evidence for the infection threshold. Simulations were computed, for importations of US wheat into EU and desert durum wheat into Italy, based on original model and an updated model with revised parameter values. Model output was <b>teliospores</b> number per hectare on soil surface of each EU country. Simulated <b>teliospores</b> numbers entering EU were lower with the updated than with the original model. These results showed a high uncertainty, underestimated with the original model, over the number of <b>teliospores</b> entering each EU country. Sensitivity analysis showed several key parameters (proportion of bunted kernels in Arizona regulated counties, number of Arizona positive hectares and number of <b>teliospores</b> per bunted kernel) strongly influencing number of <b>teliospores</b> entering the EU. In addition, high sensitivity indices were obtained with the updated wheat model for several parameters related to EU country characteristics. Further {{research is needed to}} refine parameter values, to reduce uncertainty and to determine relationship between <b>teliospores</b> number on soil surface and number of bunted kernels resulting from infection of a wheat plant. The Panel concluded that the US bunted kernel standard does not provide a level of protection equivalent to EU requirements and that such level of protection could only be warranted by measures which include testing at harvest and before shipment to detect T. indica <b>teliospores...</b>|$|R

50|$|Control of Tilletia indica {{has proven}} {{challenging}} for many reasons. First, since teliospores do not infect kernels systematically, chemical control via seed treatments {{has not been}} a viable solution. Several other methods, such as delaying planting so as to avoid the weather conditions which favor <b>teliospore</b> germination, have been proven to be effective to some extent, but also pose the risk of reducing yield. Other cultural controls such as crop-rotation may be practical as the planting of non-host species for several years may reduce the number of teliospores in given field significantly.|$|E
50|$|The most {{effective}} and widely used management strategy for common bunt is to treat seed with fungicide before planting. According to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources, it is recommended to buy certified, fungicide-treated seed or have it cleaned and treated by a commercial seed conditioner. There are ways that farmers can manipulate {{the severity of the}} infection to a certain extent. For example, they can plant the seed when the soil temperature is higher than what is ideal for <b>teliospore</b> germination, e.g., above 68 °F. For winter wheat this means planting in early fall and for spring wheat planting in late spring. This tactic can reduce the amount of smut that occurs, but it typically does not completely eliminate the disease. Typically, smut poses more of a problem in winter wheat than in spring wheat because in autumn, when winter wheat is planted, there is a longer period of more favorable temperatures for <b>teliospore</b> germination than compared to the planting season for spring wheat. There are no current wheat cultivars on the market with good resistance to common bunt. However, there have been research efforts that utilize DNA marking of resistant cultivars in the attempt to understand the specific genes that code for resistance against common bunt. This may be applied for future breeding of commercially available resistant wheat crop.|$|E
50|$|The smuts are {{multicellular}} fungi {{characterized by}} their {{large numbers of}} <b>teliospores.</b> The smuts get their name from a Germanic word for dirt because of their dark, thick-walled, and dust-like <b>teliospores.</b> They are mostly Ustilaginomycetes (of the class Teliomycetae, subphylum Basidiomycota) and can cause plant disease. The smuts are grouped with the other basidiomycetes because of their commonalities concerning sexual reproduction.|$|R
40|$|Orange rust of Rubus is an {{interesting}} disease {{because of the fact}} that it can be caused by three different rust fungi that produce virtually identical symptoms. One is Gymnoconia peckiana (Howe in Peck) Trotter, which is a demicyclic species, while the other two are endocyclic forms historically referred to as Gymnoconia nitens (Schwein.) Kern 2 ̆ 6 H. W. Thurston. Although the spores produced on infected Rubus leaves by these latter two forms are morphologically identical to the aeciospores of G. peckiana, they actually function as <b>teliospores.</b> However, the <b>teliospores</b> of one of the forms gives rise to two-celled promycelia that bear only two basidiospores, while <b>teliospores</b> of the other produce four-celled promycelia bearing four basidiospores. Here, we examined the <b>teliospores</b> of the four-spored form along with the sequence of events that lead to basidiospore development. Developing and mature <b>teliospores</b> were binucleate, and we saw no evidence that karyogamy occurred in these spores. Upon germination, both spore nuclei migrated into the promycelium and underwent mitosis to form a total of four nuclei. Four transverse septa then developed, creating four uninucleate cells. A tapered sterigma arose from each cell and gave rise to a basidiospore. These findings indicate that the basidiospores of the four-spored form of G. nitens were formed in an asexual fashion...|$|R

5000|$|Maize head smut {{occurs in}} most maize-growing areas, {{including}} many regions of North America, Australia, Asia, and southern Europe. It causes tremendous loss of yield during outbreaks {{due to the}} replacement of the ear with large smut sori. [...] To infect maize roots, S. reilianum f. sp. zeae must form a dikaryotic parasitic hypha which results for the mating of two compatible haploid strains. The infection always occurs in soil via the root, unlike Ustilago maydis, another maize smut, which infects maize plants via aerial parts. Temperatures of 23-30 °C are optimal for field infection of corn, suspected to be due to maximum <b>teliospore</b> germination.|$|E
5000|$|The sex organs in the induced {{hermaphroditic}} flowers become sterile as {{a result}} of infection, a process known as [...] "parasitic castration".

Consequently, both male and female reproductive organs within induced hermaphroditic flowers of buffalograss become parasitically castrated, but for different reasons.

At the apex of this structure, then, can be found 65-180 primary sporidia. Secondary sporidia can then either bud from the primary sporidia or from the fungal threads of the mycelium itself. These secondary sporidia are responsible for infecting young host plants through the ovary wall in the flowering stage. Secondary sporidia accomplish this by penetrating the epidermis of host glumes via germ tubes. Sporidia are then able to enter the maturing kernels and leave vast numbers of teliospores where healthy kernel tissue used to be. During harvest teliospores fall from the kernels to the soil from which point they may be carried elsewhere by wind or tools, thereby restarting the disease cycle.|$|E
