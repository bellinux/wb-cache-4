5|$|After {{the capture}} of Sevastopol, Hitler felt Manstein was the right man to command the forces at Leningrad, which had been under siege since September 1941. With {{elements}} of the 11th Army, Manstein {{was transferred to the}} Leningrad front, arriving on 27 August 1942. Manstein again lacked the proper forces to storm the city, so he planned Operation Nordlicht, a bold plan for a thrust <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> Leningrad's supply line at Lake Ladoga.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{resolution}} {{was not as}} strong as Mason had liked—he wanted Virginia to threaten <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> tobacco—Mason worked in the following years for non-importation. The repeal of most of the Townshend duties (excepting that on tea) made his task more difficult. In March 1773, his wife Ann died of illness contracted after another pregnancy. Mason was the sole parent to nine children, and his commitments made him even more reluctant to accept political office that would take him from Gunston Hall.|$|E

5|$|In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway {{to protect}} {{shipments}} of iron ore from Sweden, which the Allies were attempting <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> by unilaterally mining neutral Norwegian waters. Denmark capitulated {{after a few}} hours, and despite Allied support, during which the important harbour of Narvik temporarily was recaptured from the Germans, Norway was conquered within two months.

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to lure out and destroy {{a portion of the}} Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet {{departed}} the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May 1916 in support of Hipper's battlecruisers which were to act as bait. Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation, so the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet to sortie the night before <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> and destroy the High Seas Fleet.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Scheer's fleet, {{composed}} of 16 dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts, six light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats departed the Jade {{early on the}} morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Hipper's five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The British navy's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation, and so sortied the Grand Fleet, totaling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, the night before in order <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> and destroy the High Seas Fleet.|$|E

When French lookouts spotted distant topsails, Villaret de Joyeuse decided that Cornwallis's actions meant that a British fleet was approaching to support him, and called off the pursuit. There was no British fleet in the vicinity; the topsails were those of a convoy of British merchantmen.|$|E
