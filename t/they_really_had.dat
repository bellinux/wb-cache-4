25|$|The fusion really worked, {{and after}} two days of intense rehearsals we had an amazingly tight piece, {{although}} we had problems with twenty dancers being covered in bruises! In order to get the attitude across and the intensity with the choreography <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> to slap each other.

25|$|Ichthyosaurs {{became even}} more popular in 1854 by the {{rebuilding}} at Sydenham Hill of the Crystal Palace, originally erected at the world exhibition of 1851. In the surrounding park, life-sized, painted, concrete statues of extinct animals were placed, which were designed by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins {{under the direction of}} Richard Owen. Among them were three models of an ichthyosaur. Although it was known that ichthyosaurs had been animals of the open seas, they were shown basking on the shore, a convention followed by many nineteenth century illustrations with the aim, as Conybeare once explained, of better exposing their build. This led to the misunderstanding that <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> an amphibious lifestyle. The pools in the park were at the time subjected to tidal changes, so that fluctuations in the water level at intervals submerged the ichthyosaur statues, adding a certain realism. Remarkably, internal skeletal structures, such as the scleral rings and the many phalanges of the flippers, were shown at the outside.|$|E
25|$|His {{attitude}} toward the Kabbalah is determined by his conservative standpoint. Its elements, {{as far as they}} {{can be traced back to}} the Talmud, he considered to be true. When the inhabitants of Fez made inquiries regarding the proportions of God, he answered, as one of the signers of the responsum, that God is above any corporeal qualification and that the Talmud forbids the public discussion of these things. His answer to the question regarding the interpretation of the Talmudic tradition that four men entered paradise is interesting, and has caused much discussion. He refers to the opinion of various scholars that specially favored persons could attain, by means of castigation and the reciting of psalms, to an ecstatic state in which they might behold the heavenly halls ("hekalot") as vividly as if <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> entered them. Contrary to his father-in-law, Samuel ben Hofni, gaon of Sura, he followed former scholars in deeming it not impossible that God should reveal the marvels of heaven to the pious while in this state of ecstasy. But all the elements of the later Kabbalah not found in Talmudic tradition, as the belief that miracles could be performed with the names of God, he designated as foolishness not credited by any sensible man.|$|E

500|$|As {{reported}} in the German magazine Der Spiegel, the première (and only performance to date) on 15 November 1969 of Stockhausen's work Fresco for four orchestral groups (playing in four different locations) {{was the scene of}} a scandal. The rehearsals were already marked by objections from the orchestral musicians questioning such directions as [...] "glissandos no faster than one octave per minute" [...] and others phoning the artists union to clarify whether <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> to perform the Stockhausen work as part of the orchestra. In the backstage warm-up room at the premiere a hand-lettered sign could be seen saying: [...] "We're playing, otherwise we would be [...] ". During the première the parts on some music stands suddenly were replaced by placards reading things like [...] "Stockhausen-Zoo. Please don't feed", that someone had planted. Some musicians, fed up with the monkeyshines, left after an hour, though the performance was planned for four to five hours. Stockhausen fans protested, while Stockhausen foes were needling the musicians asking: [...] "How can you possibly participate in such crap?" [...] ("Wie könnt ihr bloß so eine Scheiße machen!"). At one point someone managed to switch off the stand lights, leaving the musicians in the dark. After 260 minutes the performance ended with nobody participating any more [...]|$|E

In relation to [...] "This Time Around", Hunter described it as a [...] "dynamite jam" [...] that's [...] "ripe for remixes" [...] and described [...] "Scream" [...] and [...] "Tabloid Junkie," [...] as being [...] "adventurous" [...] while noting that [...] "Earth Song" [...] as a [...] "noble sentiments" [...] that sounds [...] "primarily like a showpiece". Jim Farber of the New York Daily News gave the album a generally mixed review and commented that he would give the album's first disc three stars if it was released on its own. Jon Pareles of The New York Times believed that Jackson [...] "muttered" [...] lyrics such as [...] "They thought <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> control of me". Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times said of [...] "This Time Around", [...] "a tough, rhythm-guitar-driven track co-written and co-produced by hit-maker Dallas Austin that sports one of the album's better grooves".|$|E

On May 25, 2011 Lockheed Martin agreed to purchase a D-Wave One system. Lockheed and the University of Southern California (USC) will house the D-Wave One at the newly formed USC Lockheed Martin Quantum Computing Center. D-Wave's engineers designed the chips with an empirical approach, focusing on solving particular problems.

Later work showed that classical models are insufficient when all available data is considered. Experts remain divided on the ultimate classification of the D-Wave systems though their quantum behavior was established concretely with a demonstration of entanglement.|$|E
