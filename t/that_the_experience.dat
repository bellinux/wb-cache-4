5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.|$|E
5|$|Harmon {{thought that}} Far Cry 4 was an {{improvement}} over Far Cry 3, but {{he thought that the}} game felt and played too similarly to Far Cry 3, and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for Far Cry 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> delivered by Far Cry 4 did not stray far away from Far Cry 3. Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to Far Cry 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> offered by Far Cry 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.|$|E

At the same time he served as Secretary to the first Commonwealth Committee which allocated federal funds to universities for research. Madgwick later explained that these experiences at the federal government level influenced his belief that adult education programs should be decentralised to the state level.

5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory of Mind {{may play a role}} in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability to know <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|After it was shelved by Jive Records for two years, Miguel {{released}} his debut album All I Want Is You in November 2010. It sold poorly {{at first and}} was underpromoted by Jive, amid the label's dissolution. However, as its singles attained radio airplay and Miguel toured in its promotion, the album became a sleeper hit and helped him garner an audience and commercial standing. He also garnered a following with his fervent concert performances. After Jive was shut down and absorbed by RCA Records, Miguel acquired a new marketing team to develop himself {{as more than a}} typical urban artist, having felt pigeonholed into being marketed as one by Jive. He said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of balancing creativity and business sense on his first album made him more confident in his approach on Kaleidoscope Dream.|$|E
40|$|When we {{read books}} or see noble sights, our states are emotionally moved (Tokaji, 2004). Japanese people call these states as 2 ̆ 2 kandoh 2 ̆ 2.

However, {{it is unclear}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> of kandoh in childhood influence self-consciousness of children.

We administered questionnaire to 389 children on the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> of kandoh and self-efficacy or self-esteem. Our results showed that: (a) <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> of kandoh was constructed by one factor, (b) <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> of kandoh had a positive effect on self-efficacy, and (c) <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> of kandoh had a positive effect on self-esteem.

30|$|In our study, {{participants}} made a “normal/abnormal” {{decision to}} briefly presented upright and inverted mammograms. In order {{to rule out}} any age-related inversion effect, {{participants were asked to}} judge the facial expressions (e.g., neutral/happy) of briefly presented upright and inverted faces. Recognition of facial expressions, like facial identity, recruits holistic perception that is disrupted by inversion (Calder & Jansen, 2005). We made three predictions: First, given that virtually everyone is an expert in holistic expression perception, we expected <b>that</b> both <b>the</b> <b>experienced</b> and resident radiologists would show an inversion effect in their perception of expression (i.e., better detection of happy expressions in upright faces than inverted faces). Second, we hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>experienced</b> radiologists (<[*] 5  years of radiology practice) would be more accurate in their discriminations of upright mammograms than novice radiology residents. Finally, as evidence of their holistic strategies, we predicted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>experienced</b> radiologists should show a greater inversion effect to mammograms (i.e., difference between upright and inverted recognition) than the resident radiologists.|$|R

The Great Depression had resulted in Burnet's salary being cut from 1000 to 750 pounds, and the National Institute {{had been given a}} large grant from the Rockefeller Foundation that allowed them to hire Burnet at 1000 pounds per annum. The National Institute's Director Sir Henry Dale gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet's job for him when he returned and felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> would make Burnet—whom he saw as the Hall Institute's brightest young scientist—better equipped to expand operations when he returned to Melbourne. Dale also paid for Burnet's sister to travel to England to help look after her brother's young children.|$|E
5|$|Having {{worked with}} Cary Guffey on Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Spielberg felt {{confident}} {{in working with}} a cast composed mostly of child actors. For the role of Elliott, he auditioned hundreds of boys before Jack Fisk suggested Henry Thomas for the role because Henry had played the part of Harry in the movie Raggedy Man which Jack Fisk had directed. Thomas, who auditioned in an Indiana Jones costume, did not perform well in the formal testing, but got the filmmakers' attention in an improvised scene. Thoughts of his dead dog inspired his convincing tears. Robert MacNaughton auditioned eight times to play Michael, sometimes with boys auditioning for Elliott. Spielberg felt Drew Barrymore had the right imagination for mischievous Gertie after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band. He enjoyed working with the children, and he later said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> made him feel ready to be a father.|$|E
5|$|Deficits in {{cognitive}} abilities are {{widely recognized as}} a core feature of schizophrenia. The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is a predictor of how functional an individual will be, the quality of occupational performance, and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment. The presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia {{has been reported to}} be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms. The deficits impacting the cognitive function are found in a large number of areas: working memory, long-term memory, verbal declarative memory, semantic processing, episodic memory, attention, learning (particularly verbal learning). Deficits in verbal memory are the most pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia, and are not accounted for by deficit in attention. Verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in individuals with schizophrenia to semantically encode (process information relating to meaning), which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long-term memory. When given a list of words, healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently (known as the Pollyanna principle); however, individuals with schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their connotations, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> of anhedonia impairs the semantic encoding of the words. These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent. First-degree family members of individuals with schizophrenia and other high-risk individuals also show a degree of deficit {{in cognitive}} abilities, and specifically in working memory.A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence, or as early as childhood. The deficits which an individual with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients, or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables.|$|E
