50|$|The <b>turbopause</b> {{marks the}} {{altitude}} in the Earth's atmosphere below which turbulent mixing dominates. The region below the <b>turbopause</b> {{is known as}} the homosphere, where the chemical constituents are well mixed and display identical height distributions; in other words, the chemical composition of the atmosphere remains constant in this region for chemical species which have long mean residence times. Highly reactive chemicals tend to exhibit great concentration variability throughout the atmosphere, whereas unreactive species will exhibit more homogeneous concentrations. The region above the <b>turbopause</b> is the heterosphere, where molecular diffusion dominates and the chemical composition of the atmosphere varies according to chemical species.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Turbopause</b> was {{a series}} of spaceflights {{conducted}} by Clemson University to research the upper atmosphere. Four Terrier-Orion rockets were launched from Poker Flat on 18 February, at 09:52, 10:29, 10:59 and 11:47 GMT. [...] The rockets released trimethyl aluminium vapours into the upper atmosphere to study turbulence at high altitudes.|$|E
50|$|Turbulence {{causes the}} air within the lower {{atmospheric}} regions below the <b>turbopause</b> at about 110 km to be {{a mixture of}} gases that does not change its composition. Its mean molecular weight is 29 g/mol with molecular oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) as the two dominant constituents. Above the <b>turbopause,</b> however, diffusive separation of the various constituents is significant, so that each constituent follows its own barometric height structure with a scale height inversely proportional to its molecular weight. The lighter constituents atomic oxygen (O), helium (He), and hydrogen (H) successively dominate above about 200 km altitude and vary with geographic location, time, and solar activity. The ratioN2/O which {{is a measure of}} the electron density at the ionospheric F region is highly affected by these variations. These changes follow from the diffusion of the minor constituents through the major gas component during dynamic processes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{homosphere}} and heterosphere {{are defined}} by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed. The surface-based homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lowest part of the thermosphere, where the chemical composition of the atmosphere {{does not depend on}} molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence. This relatively homogeneous layer ends at the <b>turbopause</b> found at about 100 km, the very edge of space itself as accepted by the FAI, which places it about 20 km above the mesopause.|$|E

This is also around the same altitude as the <b>turbopause,</b> below which different chemical species are well mixed due to turbulent eddies. Above this level the atmosphere becomes non-uniform; the scale heights of different chemical species differ by their molecular masses.|$|E

50|$|The line {{is named}} after Theodore von Kármán (1881-1963), a Hungarian-American {{engineer}} and physicist, who was active primarily in aeronautics and astronautics. He {{was the first person}} to calculate that the atmosphere around this altitude becomes too thin to support aeronautical flight, since a vehicle at this altitude would have to travel faster than orbital velocity to derive sufficient aerodynamic lift to support itself. The line is approximately at the <b>turbopause,</b> above which atmospheric gasses are not well-mixed. The mesopause atmospheric temperature minimum has been measured to vary from 85 to 100 km, which places the line at or near the bottom of the thermosphere.|$|E

50|$|The F1 {{layer is}} the lower {{sector of the}} F layer and exists from about 150 to 220 km above {{the surface of the}} Earth and only during {{daylight}} hours. It is composed of a mixture of molecular ions O2+ and NO+, and atomic ions O+. Above the F1 region, atomic oxygen becomes the dominant constituent because lighter particles tend to occupy higher altitudes above the <b>turbopause</b> (at ~100 km). This atomic oxygen provides the O+ atomic ions that make up the F2 layer.The F1 layer has approximately 5 &times; 105 e/cm3 (free electrons per cubic centimeter) at noontime and minimum sunspot activity, and increases to roughly 2 &times; 106 e/cm3 during maximum sunspot activity.

5000|$|In the interview, {{published}} in 1977 by Kansan Uutiset and Uusi Suomi, the employee of Nurmijärvi geophysical observatory Matti Kivinen assumed that an unidentified object over Finland {{could be the}} remnant of a launch vehicle or satellite. James Oberg attributed the Petrozavodsk object to {{the launch of the}} Soviet satellite Kosmos-955 from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, which took place on September 20 at about 3:58 local time. According to James Oberg, because Kosmos-955 was launched in the north-eastern direction, the residents of Petrozavodsk (located to the south-west from Plesetsk) observed the blaze trail from the satellite's nozzles, which caused the phenomenon. Oberg's view was endorsed particularly by the IZMIRAN fellow Yuli Platov in 1984. According to Platov, the appearance of a shining spot was associated with the flare of the satellite's engine. [...] The formation of an extended glowing area reportedly coincided with the satellite's leaving the Earth's shadow. Platov further linked the development of the radiant structure to the passage of Kosmos-955 through the <b>turbopause</b> boundary, [...] "above which the scattering of combustion products occurs without the damping effect of the atmosphere". In 1985 Platov's view was published by Soviet magazine Nauka v SSSR. In a later article Platov noted that [...] "a number of additional effects, that accompanied the Petrozavodsk phenomenon, was associated with the unsuccessful test launch of a ballistic missile, that was conducted in the same region almost at the same time". Nonetheless, since the inconclusive Soviet investigation, the Kosmos-955 argument remains contested. Referring to his 18-year service experience at Kapustin Yar site, Ukrainian researcher Oleh Pruss said: [...] "I know firsthand, what a spectacular in the sky occurs during the rocket launches - it's quite an impressive view. However, there was something completely different over Petrozavodsk".|$|E
40|$|The {{occultation}} of {{the star}} Beta Scorpii by Jupiter was observed at high time resolution in three wavelength channels. The results imply a temperature of 220 K at an altitude in the Jovian atmosphere corresponding to 100 trillion molecules per cubic centimeter, and temperature fluctuations of 2 to 10 K over vertical scales of 2 to 10 kilometers. They suggest that the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient near the <b>turbopause</b> has a lower limit of 700, 000 square centimeters per second, and that the <b>turbopause</b> lies above the altitude where the density is 50 trillion molecules per cubic centimeter. Below the <b>turbopause,</b> the ratio of hydrogen to helium is consistent with cosmic abundances...|$|E
40|$|Climatologies {{of gravity}} waves, quasi-stationary {{planetary}} waves, and tides are compared {{in the upper}} stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere. Temperature standard deviations from zonal means are used as proxies for wave activity. The sum of the waves is compared to directly measured total temperature fluctuations. The resulting difference {{is used as a}} proxy for traveling planetary waves. A preliminary climatology for these waves is proposed. A ranking of the four wave types in terms of their impact on the total wave state of the atmosphere is achieved, which is dependent on altitude and latitude. At extratropical latitudes, gravity waves mostly play a major role. Traveling planetary waves are found to play a secondary role. Quasi-stationary planetary waves and tides yield a lesser contribution there. Vertical profiles of total temperature fluctuations show a sharp vertical gradient change("kink" or "bend") in the mesosphere. This is interpreted in terms of a change of wave damping, and the concept of a "wave turbopause" is suggested. The altitude of this wave <b>turbopause</b> is found to be mostly determined by the relative intensities of gravity waves and planetary waves. The <b>turbopause</b> is further analyzed, including earlier mass spectrometer data. It is found that the wave <b>turbopause</b> and the mass spectrometer <b>turbopause</b> occur rather close together. The <b>turbopause</b> forms a layer about 8 km thick, and the data suggest an additional 3 km mixing layer on top...|$|E
40|$|The <b>turbopause</b> {{region is}} {{characterized}} by transition from the mean molecular mass (constant with altitude) to the mean mass (dependent on altitude). The former is provided by eddy turbulence, and the latter is induced by molecular diffusion. Competition between these processes provides {{the transition from the}} homosphere to the heterosphere. The <b>turbopause</b> altitude can be defined by equalizing the eddy and molecular diffusion coefficients and can be located in the upper mesosphere or the lower thermosphere. The height distributions of chemical inert gases very clearly demonstrate the transition from turbulent mixing to the diffusive separation of these gases. Using the height distributions of the chemical inert constituents He, Ar, and N 2 given by the MSIS-E- 90 model and the continuity equations, the height distribution of the eddy diffusion coefficient in the <b>turbopause</b> region can be inferred. The eddy diffusion coefficient always strongly reduces in the <b>turbopause</b> region. According to our results, eddy turbulence above its peak always cools the atmosphere. However, the cooling rates calculated with the eddy heat transport coefficient equaled to the eddy diffusion coefficient were found to be much larger than the cooling rates corresponding to the neutral temperatures given by the MSIS-E- 90 model. The same results were obtained for the eddy diffusion coefficients inferred from different experimental data. The main cause of this large cooling is the very steep negative gradient of the eddy heat transport coefficient, which is equal to the eddy diffusion coefficient if uniform turbulence takes place in the <b>turbopause</b> region. Analysis of wind shear shows that localized turbulence can develop in the <b>turbopause</b> region. In this case, eddy heat transport is not so effective and the strong discrepancy between cooling induced by eddy turbulence and cooling corresponding to the temperature given by the MSIS-E- 90 model can be removed...|$|E
40|$|A {{method by}} means of which the {{characteristics}} of atmospheric turbulence can be determined is discussed. Turbulent diffusivity deduced from ionospheric sporadic E in different altitudes above the ionospheric stations at Bekescsaba and Juliusrah are given. Seasonal variations in different altitudes above Bekescsaba are shown. An {{attempt was made to}} determine the variation of the turbulent diffusivity during and after geomagnetic disturbances by computing the horizontal wind velocity from the thermal wind equation. It is argued that the change of the turbulent diffusivity below the <b>turbopause</b> is opposed to that above the <b>turbopause...</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>turbopause</b> is the {{demarcation}} between atmospheric mixing by turbulence (below) {{and molecular}} diffusion (above). When studying concentrations of trace {{species in the}} atmosphere, and particularly long-term change, it may be important to understand processes present, together with their temporal evolution that {{may be responsible for}} redistribution of atmospheric constituents. The general region of transition between turbulent and molecular mixing coincides with the base of the ionosphere, the lower region in which molecular oxygen is dissociated, and, at high latitude in summer, the coldest part of the whole atmosphere. This study updates previous reports of <b>turbopause</b> altitude, extending the time series by half a decade, and thus shedding new light on the nature of change over solar-cycle timescales. Assuming there is no trend in temperature, at 70 ◦ N there is evidence for a summer trend of ∼ 1. 6 km decade− 1, but for winter and at 52 ◦ N there is no significant evidence for change at all. If the temperature at 90 km is estimated using meteor trail data, it is possible to estimate a cooling rate, which, if applied to the <b>turbopause</b> altitude estimation, fails to alter the trend significantly irrespective of season. The observed increase in <b>turbopause</b> height supports a hypothesis of corresponding negative trends in atomic oxygen density, [O]. This supports independent studies of atomic oxygen density, [O], using mid-latitude time series dating from 1975, which show negative trends since 2002...|$|E
40|$|The {{mesopause}} region can {{be considered}} a "boundary region" between the neutral atmosphere, where atmospheric constituents and momentum are transported mainly by winds and turbulent eddies, and the ionosphere, where the main transport mechanism is molecular diffusion. In the mesopause, complex interactions between dynamics and photochemistry occur, and we are far from a complete understanding of these interactions. This thesis aims to better understand the processes responsible for the large temperature fluctuations we observe in the polar mesopause region, especially the effects of atmospheric circulation and wave activity from lower atmospheric layers. Investigations of trends have also been conducted. To carry out these investigations, we have derived and examined mesopause temperatures from two high-latitude locations: Tromsø (70 °N, 19 °E) and Longyearbyen (78 °N, 16 °E), and <b>turbopause</b> height only from Tromsø. A long-term change in <b>turbopause</b> height may be important for understanding processes that are responsible for redistribution of atmospheric constituents. We examined winter season variations in the hydroxyl (OH*) airglow temperature record from Longyearbyen and identified local temperature maxima in mid-January and mid-February, as well as a minimum in the transition between December and January. We also identified a number of statistically significant periodic oscillations in temperatures derived from the Nippon/Norway Tromsø Meteor Radar, with periods ranging from 9 days to a year. The seasonal variation showed higher temperatures and variability during winter compared to summer. We also found local temperature enhancements just after spring equinox and summer solstice. Temperature variability and seasonal variation may, to a large extent, be explained by the large-scale circulation in the middle atmosphere and corresponding wave activity. The trends for the Longyearbyen OH* airglow winter temperature series and meteor radar derived temperatures from Tromsø, both annual and summer trends, were estimated to be near-zero or slightly negative. The Tromsø winter trend was negative, (- 11. 6 ± 4. 1) K/decade. We derived <b>turbopause</b> altitude from turbulent energy dissipation rates obtained from the Tromsø medium-frequency radar and found an increasing height in summer, (1. 6 ± 0. 3) km/decade, during the time period from 2002 until 2015, while in winter <b>turbopause</b> height did not change significantly. We investigated the response of the change in <b>turbopause</b> height to a change in temperature, but a changing temperature did not alter trends significantly, irrespective of season...|$|E
40|$|The "wave turbopause" {{is defined}} as the mesospheric {{altitude}} level where the temperature fluctuation field indicates a substantial increase in wave amplitudes in the vertical direction. The <b>turbopause</b> altitude is analyzed on the basis of four years of SABER data (2002 - 2005, Version 1. 06). Substantial seasonal and latitudinal variations are found, with some interannual variability also present. Seasonal changes are annual at high latitudes, semi-annual at low latitudes, and a mixture of both at middle latitudes. Southern hemisphere data are similar as in the North if shifted by half a year. Latitudinal variations show a minimum in the tropics and two relative maxima at middle latitudes. The "wave turbopause" is found near to zero-wind lines or low-wind zones (zonal wind). It is compared to rocket and other measurements, and interesting similarities are obtained. The wave <b>turbopause</b> can also be found in the HAMMONIA GCM.

Often, separating the components and sources of variability in observations is a challenging task. Thus, following their observations of an SSW, Kurihara et al.

40|$|Recently, an {{increasing}} number of modelling and observational studies have looked at the signatures of small-scale waves, such as gravity waves (GWs) of meteorological origin, in the upper atmosphere. General circulation models require an appropriate GW parameterisation to reproduce a realistic global circulation. Existing schemes implemented into GCMs lack a physically proper wave dissipation mechanism above the <b>tur,bopause.</b> For more self-consistent wave propagation in GCMs, and to estimate their dynamic and energetic importance in the upper atmosphere, it is crucial to account for realistic upper atmospheric dissipation processes. The UCL Coupled Middle Atmosphere-Thermosphere- 2 (CMAT 2) general circulation model was developed in order to investigate atmospheric vertical coupling. This model is an updated version of its predecessor CMAT. Three GW parameterisations of different characteristics have been implemented into CMAT 2. While they all, to some extent, reproduce the necessary mesosphere and lower thermosphere (ML T) dynamics, artificial dissipation above the <b>turbopause</b> is a problem in all these schemes.. Therefore, an extended spectral non-linear GW parameterisation, which incorporates more physically realistic GW dissipation, has been developed. Using an offline column model, the sensitivity of GW propagation and dissipation in the thermosphere-ionosphere has been studied. Considerable GW propagation into the upper atmosphere is demonstrated. The associated wave forcing and heating are significant. This new extended scheme has been implemented in CMAT 2. Its dynamical effects on the circulation of the upper atmosphere have been investigated. Results demonstrate the importance of GW momentum flux divergence in the thermosphere-ionosphere. The extended scheme improves the model simulations markedly with respect to an empirical model. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
