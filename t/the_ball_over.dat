5|$|The {{difference}} in the game came from special teams and turnovers. Virginia Tech turned <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> three times, while Kansas turned <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> just once. Kansas converted its three takeaways into 17points, giving the Jayhawks an enormous advantage on the scoreboard. Virginia Tech failed to convert its sole turnover recovery into any points.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{began their}} next drive {{at their own}} 26-yard line, but went three-and-out. Buffalo punter Peter Fardon kicked <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> the head of UConn {{returner}} Jasper Howard; rather than let the ball go, he ran backwards chasing after it. Trying to grab <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, he muffed the catch, and the ball bounced into the end zone, where it was recovered by Buffalo's Ray Anthony Long for a Bull touchdown. The special-teams miscue by Howard allowed Buffalo {{to tie the game}} at 10–10 with 11:36 remaining in the second quarter.|$|E
5|$|In the Purdue game, Robinson turned <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> {{four times}} (two interceptions and two lost fumbles) in heavy rain and gusting wind. Robinson was also {{held to a}} season-low 68 rushing yards against Purdue.|$|E
25|$|In 1889 <b>the</b> immemorial four <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> was {{replaced}} by a five <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> and then this was changed to <b>the</b> current six <b>balls</b> an <b>over</b> in 1900. Subsequently, some countries experimented with eight <b>balls</b> an <b>over.</b> In 1922, <b>the</b> number of <b>balls</b> per <b>over</b> was changed from six to eight in Australia only. In 1924 <b>the</b> eight <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> was extended to New Zealand and in 1937 to South Africa. In England, <b>the</b> eight <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> was adopted experimentally for the 1939 season; the intention was to continue the experiment in 1940, but first-class cricket was suspended for the Second World War and when it resumed, English cricket reverted to <b>the</b> six <b>ball</b> <b>over.</b> <b>The</b> 1947 Laws of Cricket allowed six or eight <b>balls</b> depending on <b>the</b> conditions of play. Since the 1979/80 Australian and New Zealand seasons, <b>the</b> six <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> has been used worldwide and the most recent version of the Laws in 2000 only permits six <b>ball</b> <b>overs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A goal is scored when <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is hit or pushed {{from within}} the opponents' {{defensive}} zone, and then passes into or through the opponents' goal. If <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> goes <b>over</b> <b>the</b> side line, the opposing team shall have a free push {{at the point where}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> crossed <b>the</b> line. If <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> goes <b>over</b> <b>the</b> back line, the opposing team shall have a free push on the 10 metre line opposite the point where <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> went <b>over</b> <b>the</b> back line.|$|R
5000|$|Successful {{field goals}} now must travel between the uprights; {{previously}} {{a field goal}} was declared good if <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> went <b>over</b> an upright. This was a point of dispute in the 1974 Ohio State-Michigan game, as Michigan's game-winning field goal attempt was declared no good due to <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> going <b>over</b> <b>the</b> left upright. Michigan claimed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> curled just inside the left upright.|$|R
5|$|The Lobos gained {{three more}} first downs on their final drive, but {{were unable to}} score again before turning <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> on downs. The Midshipmen ran one more quarterback kneel play to run out the clock, winning {{the game with a}} final score of 34–19.|$|E
5|$|The pass fell incomplete, and Tech turned <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> on downs {{with four}} seconds remaining. Rather than attempt to {{score on the}} final play of the half, the Tide offense took a knee and ended the half with Virginia Tech leading, 107.|$|E
5|$|The try at goal failed, but the ball, {{instead of}} going to the Cliftons behind the line, fell into the field and into the hands of one of the Academy team. By a quick decisive run, he again got <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> the Cliftons goal line and scored a touchdown.|$|E

25|$|A scrum can {{be awarded}} {{following}} a forward pass, knock on or <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> going <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sideline and into touch.|$|R
5|$|Virginia Tech turned <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> twice—once on {{a fumble}} and once on an interception. The two {{turnovers}} resulted in twotouchdowns for Florida State, {{and the resulting}} 14 points were greater than Florida State's margin of victory. The Seminoles did not turn <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> during the game. Both teams were highly penalized during the game. Virginia Tech finished with 17penalties for 143yards, while Florida State was penalized 12times for 114yards. The penalties affected each team's ability to convert third downs, as Virginia Tech was only able to convert 9of 20third-down attempts, while Florida State was successful on just 3of its 13attempts. Despite trailing {{for much of the}} game and running a pass-heavy offense, Virginia Tech dominated the game's time of possession, controlling the ball for over 35of the game's 60minutes.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's leading rusher was Eddie Hunter, {{who carried}} the ball 12times for 75yards. Tech quarterback Mark Cox {{finished}} the game having completed just {{six of his}} 17passes for 50passing yards and one interception. In total, Tech turned <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> four times—twice via interceptions and twice via lost fumbles.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the punt, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan connected on a 31-yard pass to wide receiver Brandon Robinson. As before, however, the offense stalled. On 4th-and-1 from the Virginia Tech 30-yard line, Ryan attempted a pass that fell incomplete, turning <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> on downs. As {{a result of}} pressure applied by the Boston College defense, the Hokies continued to have difficulty moving the ball.|$|E
5000|$|... if <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> knocks <b>over</b> two pins, {{the throw}} is worth seven points; any extra pin is worth an {{additional}} point ...|$|R
5000|$|Hit - To touch <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> as an {{offensive}} player, {{one of three}} [...] "hits" [...] allowed a team in getting <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> back <b>over</b> <b>the</b> net.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>ball</b> passes <b>over</b> <b>the</b> player's {{court or}} beyond his end line without {{touching}} his court, after {{being struck by}} the opponent.|$|R
5|$|Bolton Wanderers hosted Arsenal at the Reebok Stadium in {{the sixth}} round of the competition. Ljungberg scored the only goal of the tie after just three minutes; he had an {{opportunity}} to extend Arsenal's lead in stoppage time, but hit <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> from six yards. Arsenal faced Blackburn Rovers in the semi-final which was played at the Millennium Stadium. Two goals from Van Persie and one from Pirès gave Arsenal a 3–0 win, in a match marred by Blackburn's aggressive tactics.|$|E
5|$|Both teams' {{defenses}} {{controlled the}} third quarter, allowing no points to be scored. Navy's McKee completed three more pass plays before his first incompletion, which came on his fourteenth attempt. Washington's offense had little {{success in the}} third quarter, being held to {{only a few yards}} gained and turning <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> once. In the fourth quarter, after several unsuccessful drives by each team, Navy made a major error. After being stopped on their own 26-yard line, Navy improperly lined up in a punt formation, and the center snapped <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> the punter's head. The ball was recovered by Washington on the Navy ten-yard line. Washington lost two yards in three plays, and faced a fourth down from the Navy 12-yard line. Washington stacked their offensive line, allowing their left guard, James Bryan, to become an eligible receiver. Fred Abel passed the ball to Bryan, who caught it just short of the goal line and walked into the end zone for the touchdown. Washington's kicker then converted the extra point, tying the game at 14.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut {{dominated}} Buffalo statistically in {{the first}} half, gaining 225yards to the Bulls' 94, led by Donald Brown's 208yardsrushing. Buffalo won the turnover battle however, recovering five UConn fumbles. The Bulls scored 20points off UConn turnovers {{in the first}} half, but were held scoreless {{in the second half}} when the Huskies stopped turning <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E
60|$|Again Tom wound up, and <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> shot <b>over</b> <b>the</b> plate. This {{time the}} batsman swung for it, {{but failed to}} connect.|$|R
5000|$|A {{successful}} kick {{is deemed}} to be one where <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> crosses <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bar and between the posts prior to touching the ground.|$|R
5000|$|After <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was <b>over,</b> after <b>the</b> {{break of}} morn,After the dancers' leaving, after {{the stars are}} gone;Many a heart is aching, if you could read them all;Many the hopes that have vanished, after <b>the</b> ball.After <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was <b>over,</b> Bonnie took out her glass eye,Put her false teeth in the water, hung up her wig to dry;Placed her false arm on the table, laid her false leg on the chair;After the party was over, Bonnie was only half there! ...|$|R
5|$|Florida State's offense {{began work}} from its 36-yard line, but ran four plays without gaining {{a first down}} and turned <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> on downs. Virginia Tech, whose offense began at the Florida State 45-yard line, {{proceeded}} to run down the clock. In eight plays, Tech advanced 21 yards and drained 3:22, then turned <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> on downs at the Seminole 26-yard line. Florida State's offense entered the game one final time and conducted a 12-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a 20-yard pass from Manuel to running back Chris Thompson for a touchdown. The score and subsequent extra point made the score 44–33, but only seven seconds remained in the game. The Seminoles attempted an onside kick {{in an attempt to}} have another opportunity for offense, but the Hokies recovered the kick and proceeded to run out the final seconds, earning a 44–33 victory.|$|E
5|$|Geen excelled athletically at Oxford, earning four Blues between 1910 and 1913. However, {{in three}} {{successive}} Varsity Matches, {{he failed to}} score after dropping <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> the tryline. In the holidays, he played club rugby for Newport, and {{he was part of}} the team that defeated the touring South African side of 1912–1913. He was also a decent cricketer keeping wicket for Oxford University Authentics and Monmouthshire.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{kicked the}} game off, and also {{fashioned}} {{the first chance}} of the game; Ronaldo beat Lauren on the left wing to put over a cross, only for Scholes to head <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> the crossbar after losing his marker. Two minutes later, a break from José Antonio Reyes had Carroll scampering across from his goal to meet the Spaniard, forcing Reyes wide enough to allow the United defence time to get back.|$|E
6000|$|... "One strike!" [...] {{cried the}} umpire as <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> whizzed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> plate. [...] "Ball one!" [...] came a moment later. [...] "Strike two!" [...] was {{immediately}} added.|$|R
50|$|At other times, {{when the}} Ringmaster is not visible, but <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> passes <b>over</b> him and hits a WOW target, the magnet will switch on {{and change the}} path of <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> and trigger a response.|$|R
50|$|Jamieson {{made his}} {{international}} debut for the Cook Islands in 2000.In 2007, Jamieson became infamous after sitting with <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> for <b>over</b> minute during a 2-0 defeat to Fiji.|$|R
5|$|Manchester United's {{opponents in}} the fourth round was Middlesbrough. Rooney scored twice in the team's 3–0 victory – he lobbed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer for his first goal and volleyed it for his second. Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren {{credited}} Rooney's performance afterwards and said he made {{the difference in the}} tie. Everton hosted Manchester United in the next round at Goodison Park. A goal apiece from Quinton Fortune and Ronaldo in either half ensured a 2–0 win.|$|E
5|$|Texas A {{had their}} first three-and-out of the game to begin the fourth quarter. Oklahoma {{achieved}} one first down on their subsequent drive before turning <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> on downs. Texas A scored for the final time of the game on their ensuing drive via a 34-yard touchdown pass from Manziel to Nwachukwu to make the score 41–13. Oklahoma and Texas A then exchanged punts before the final drive of the game by Oklahoma which lasted four plays prior to time running out.|$|E
5|$|After {{each team}} traded punts {{on their first}} {{possession}}s, Arkansas long snapper Will Coleman snapped <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> the head of punter Dylan Breeding that gave Alabama possession at the Razorbacks' six-yard line. On the next play, Eddie Lacy scored on a six-yard run for a 7–0 Crimson Tide lead. The Razorbacks responded with an eight-play, 51-yard drive, but failed to score any points after a 41-yard Zach Hocker field goal hit the left upright. Each team again traded punts before the Crimson Tide extended their lead to 10–0 {{early in the second}} quarter on a 51-yard Cade Foster field goal.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hi! stop that, or we'll fire at you!" [...] {{came from}} the launch, and then a pistol rang out and <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> whistled <b>over</b> <b>the</b> deck of the Dora.|$|R
60|$|When Reddy Ray {{stepped out}} it was to meet a rousing cheer, and then the {{thousands}} of feet went crash! crash! crash! Reddy fouled <b>the</b> first <b>ball</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> grand-stand. Umpire Kern threw out a new one, gleaming white. The next two pitches were wide; the following one Reddy met with the short poke he used when hitting to left field. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> went <b>over</b> Martin's head, scoring Homans with the first run of the game. That allowed the confident Wayne crowd {{to get up and}} yell long and loud. Weir fouled out upon <b>the</b> first <b>ball</b> pitched, and Blake, following him, forced Reddy out at second on an infield hit.|$|R
50|$|Under rainy {{and muddy}} conditions, the Redskins forced 6 turnovers, held <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> for <b>over</b> 36 minutes, and scored {{two touchdowns in}} a span of 3:11 in the second quarter.|$|R
