People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a nice <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>to</b> put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E

500|$|When Wodehouse {{heard of}} the furore the {{broadcasts}} had caused, he contacted the Foreign Office—through the Swiss embassy in Berlin—to explain his actions, and attempted to return home via neutral countries, but the German authorities refused to let him leave. In Performing Flea, a 1953 collection of letters, Wodehouse wrote, [...] "Of course I ought {{to have had the}} sense to see that it was a loony <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> use the German radio for even the most harmless stuff, but I didn't. I suppose prison life saps the intellect". The reaction in America was mixed: the left-leaning publication P.M. accused Wodehouse of [...] "play Jeeves to the Nazis", but the Department of War used the interviews as an ideal representation of anti-Nazi propaganda.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his time}} in the Senate, Edwards co-sponsored 203 bills. Among them was Lieberman's 2002 Iraq War Resolution (S.J.Res.46), which he co-sponsored along with 15 other senators, but which did not go to a vote. He voted for {{replacement}} resolution (H.J Res. 114) in the full Senate to authorize {{the use of military force}} against Iraq, which passed by a vote of 77 to 23, On October 10, 2002, he stated that: [...] He defended his vote on an October 10, 2004, appearance on Meet the Press, saying [...] "I would have voted for the resolution knowing what I know today, because it was the right <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> give the president the authority to confront Saddam Hussein...I think Saddam Hussein was a very serious threat. I stand by that, and that's why [...] stand behind our vote on the resolution". However, he subsequently changed his mind about the war and apologized for that military authorization vote. Edwards also voted in favor of the Patriot Act.|$|E
2500|$|The entire {{matter was}} called [...] "a terrible <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> the American people" [...] by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The {{rapid growth of}} {{television}} as a new technology in the 1950s occurred at such a rate that laws and prohibitions could not keep up. This medium was so new that people recognized neither its dangers nor its potential for manipulation. All of the regulations regarding television at that time were defined under the Federal Communications Act of 1934, which dealt with the advertising, fair competition, and labeling of broadcast stations. The Act and regulations written by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) were indefinite in regards to fixed television programs. Due {{to the fact that}} there were no specific laws regarding the fraudulent behavior in the quiz shows, it is debatable whether the producers or contestants alike did anything wrong. Instead, it could be inferred that the medium was ill-used.|$|E

2500|$|Keselowski {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win {{of the season in}} front of 102,000 people who attended the race. Keselowski also earned $186,770 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "This car here, this brand-new car that Penske Racing built -- everybody back at the shop did a phenomenal job. The last few races have been really good, and I knew we had a shot at winning one if we closed the deal. Matt didn't make it easy." [...] Kenseth, who finished second, said, [...] "I was thinking I could run outside of him , but he would roll through there so fast you could never get a run on him. I think he liked the bottom of [...] 1 and 2, but I could never get around on the bottom of [...] 1 and 2, so that was the right <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>to</b> start on the top and leave me on the bottom -- for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{garden was}} the place where my {{appearance}} as a cyclist at the Vélodrome d’Hiver was thought up. Gleizes and Villon claimed that I wouldn’t be able to cycle 100 kilometres without putting a foot on the ground. I bet them that I could {{for the price of}} a lunch. It’s actually a pretty hard <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> keep going over 100 kilometres on country roads. Neither of my opponents had a car and they didn’t want to chase after me on one of those velocipedes. A journalist from our circle of friends suggested cycling in a velodrome which is actually just as tiring, especially for someone who is not used to it. But I agreed. A few days later, one morning at ten, I began my laps in the Vélodrome d’Hiver. An hour went by and then another. The spectators, Fernand Léger was among them, cheered me on with increasing enthusiasm until quite unexpectedly the sound of a gong brought me to a halt. I had won my meal by my honourable average speed. (Metzinger) ...|$|E

There was never any doubt that I'd do it for Mike [...] and it's not something that's really been done — I don't think someone's ever died off-screen and then they've done the funeral on-screen. I think everyone was quite wary because it's quite an odd <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> have attended his real funeral and then go back to film it all over again. There was some trepidation about how it was going to work. But as soon as we arrived, it was like 11 years of your life had been wiped out and you'd been there the day before [...] I had this really lovely scene with Sid [...] where I said: [...] "Isn't it strange, you imagine you’d come back and everything would be here waiting for us just like it was."
