30|$|It can {{optimize}} and {{supplement the}} backup protection function, including supplementing the tripping failure protection function of 110 kV circuit breaker, adding the accelerated overcurrent protection on low-voltage {{side of the}} main transformer, and shortening the time for fault elimination of backup protection. Also, the simple bus protection functions of 35 kV and 10 kV buses are constructed based on the GOOSE information on the protection starting and operation of each bay. According to circuit breaker operating mode in the substation, one zone of transformer backup protection operation logic is added: if this logic judges that the bus coupler (or bus sectioning) CB is in <b>trip</b> <b>state</b> before protection tripping, the time delay of tripping circuit breakers at both sides of transformer will be shortened.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{carbonization}} pattern and operation characteristics of an MCCB. The MCCB is consisted of the actuator lever, actuator mechanism, bimetallic strip, contacts, up and down operator, arc divider or extinguisher, metal operation pin, terminal part, etc. When the actuator lever of the MCCB is at the top or the internal metal operation pin is in contact with the front part, the MCCB is turned on or off. It means <b>trip</b> <b>state</b> if the actuator lever or the internal metal operation pin moves to back side. In the UL 94 vertical combustion test, white smoke occurred from the MCCB when an average of 17 ~ 24 seconds elapsed after the MCCB was ignited and black smoke occurred when an average of 45 ~ 50 seconds elapsed. It took 5 ~ 6 minutes for the MCCB surface to be half burnt and took an average of 8 ~ 9 minutes for the MCCB surface to be entirely burnt. In the UL 94 test, the MCCB trip device operated when an average 7 ~ 8 minutes elapsed. If the MCCB trip has occurred, it may have been caused by an electrical problem such as a short-circuit, overcurrent, etc., as well as fire heat. From the entire part combustion test according to KS C 3004, it was found that the metal operation pin could be moved t...|$|E
