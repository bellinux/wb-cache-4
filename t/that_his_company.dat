5|$|Healy {{assessed}} <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>company</b> {{had encountered}} {{a force of}} at least company-size. Later {{it became apparent that}} they had indeed contacted Company 238 which was tasked with protecting the U1 headquarters and to carry out operations in the Bien Hoa region. Throughout the day Viet Cong reconnaissance parties, perhaps including those that had been contacted intermittently, had observed the approaching Australian force on a line leading directly to the U1 headquarters. During the fighting the Viet Cong company commander—Nguyen Van Bao—had split his force into two, allocating one platoon to fight the advancing Australians, and the other two to protect the headquarters. Following the Australian withdrawal Van Bao had also withdrawn, pre-empting the ensuing barrage, yet the U1 base remained in communist hands.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} {{security}} imposed on the planning for the raid was so high that when Major Frost was first briefed by a liaison officer from the headquarters of 1st Airborne Division, he was informed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>company</b> was {{to take part in}} an airborne warfare demonstration for the War Cabinet. He was also informed that C Company would be divided into four sections for the exercise, which was contrary to a plan Frost had devised for the exercise and confused him. It was only after Frost raised several objections with a more senior officer at headquarters that he was informed of the intended raid, after which the Major dropped his objections and turned his attention to training the company.|$|E
5|$|The British mission {{consisting}} of Akers and fifteen British experts arrived in December 1943. This {{was a critical}} time. Severe problems had been encountered with the Norris-Adler barrier. Nickel powder and electro-deposited nickel mesh diffusion barriers were pioneered by American chemist Edward Adler and British interior decorator Edward Norris at the SAM Laboratories. A decision {{had to be made}} whether to persevere with it or switch to a powdered nickel barrier based upon British technology that had been developed by Kellex. Up to this point, both were under development. The SAM Laboratory had 700 people working on gaseous diffusion and Kellex had about 900. The British experts conducted a thorough review, and agreed that the Kellex barrier was superior, but felt that it would be unlikely to be ready in time. Kellex's technical director, Percival C. Keith, disagreed, arguing <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>company</b> could get it ready and produce it more quickly than the Norris-Adler barrier. Groves listened to the British experts before he formally adopted the Kellex barrier on 5 January 1944.|$|E

25|$|On 18 July 1857, U.S. Army Captain Stewart Van Vliet, an {{assistant}} quartermaster, {{and a small}} escort were ordered to proceed directly from Kansas to Salt Lake City, ahead of {{the main body of}} troops.

However, Harney's letter did not mention that Young had been replaced as governor, nor did it detail what the mission of the troops would be once they arrived and these omissions sparked even greater distrust among the Saints. On his journey, reports reached Van Vliet <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>company</b> might be in danger from Mormon raiders on the trail. The Captain therefore left his escort and proceeded alone.|$|E

25|$|The attack was, however, no more {{successful}} than the concurrent Red Army offensive. Lieutenant Marsh reported at 2:00 AM <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>company</b> was lost, his horses were belly-deep in the snow, {{and that he could}} not proceed, thus neutralizing a main element in the attack until it returned to the main road, far from its objective, at 5:10 AM. The Poles had suffered heavy casualties by this time, forcing them to withdraw temporarily. Company A was partially surrounded at 6:10 AM and forced to yield ground. Lieutenant Goodloss assumed command when Captain Bailey was killed and subsequently ordered a retreat. Lieutenant , leading a platoon from Company H, 339th Infantry, rushed up from the reserves to cover the British retreat. Lt.

25|$|In total, nine {{affidavits}} {{were submitted}} by the applicant to substantiate his claims that the goods had indeed been exported. The state counsel submitted that the evidence which had been provided after December 1988 (when the application for an order of prohibition was taken out) could not be taken into consideration. While Justice Chan doubted the validity of such a submission, he nevertheless proceeded to assess the affidavits provided before this date. The applicable evidence {{was made up of}} two statements: a statement made by the applicant <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>company</b> had arranged for shipment of the goods directly with the shipowner (which explained why the vessel's agents testified that they were not aware that any goods had been loaded on to the vessel), and a statement by TKM accompanied with copies of invoices that showed he had received the goods and paid for them. Such evidence could have proved the export of the goods, and was in direct conflict with the affidavits {{submitted by the}} DG. There was thus a serious dispute as to whether the goods had in fact been exported.|$|E
25|$|In December 1984, Thomas S. Murphy, chief {{executive}} officer of Capital Cities Communications, contacted Leonard Goldenson about a proposal to merge their respective companies. On March 16, 1985, ABC's executive committee accepted the merger offer, which was formally announced on March 18, 1985, with Capital Cities purchasing ABC and its related properties for $3.5 billion and $118 for each of ABC's shares as well as a guarantee of 10% (or $3) for a total of $121 per share. To finance the purchase, Capital Cities borrowed $2.1 billion from a consortium of banks, which sold certain assets that Capital Cities could not acquire or retain due to FCC ownership rules for a combined $900 million and sold off several cable television systems, which were sold to The Washington Post Company (forming the present-day Cable One). The remaining $500 million was loaned by Warren Buffett, who promised <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>company</b> Berkshire Hathaway would purchase $3 million in shares, at $172.50 apiece. Due to an FCC ban on same-market ownership of television and radio stations by a single company (although the deal would have otherwise complied with new ownership rules implemented by the FCC in January 1985, that allowed broadcasters to own a maximum of 12 television stations), ABC and Capital Cities respectively decided to sell WXYZ-TV and Tampa independent station WFTS-TV to the E. W. Scripps Company (although Capital Cities/ABC originally intended to seek a cross-ownership waiver to retain WXYZ and Capital Cities-owned radio stations WJR and WHYT).|$|E
