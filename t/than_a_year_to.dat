5|$|In 1899 William Henry Pickering {{discovered}} Phoebe, {{a highly}} irregular satellite {{that does not}} rotate synchronously with Saturn as the larger moons do. Phoebe was the first such satellite found and it takes more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> orbit Saturn in a retrograde orbit. During the early 20th century, research on Titan led to the confirmation in 1944 {{that it had a}} thick atmosphere – a feature unique among the Solar System's moons.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{passed by}} the Massachusetts {{legislature}} in 1933 {{made it easier for}} police officers who had been off the force for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> apply for reinstatement. It was expected that this would lead to an effort by the former strikers to be rehired, but several subsequent appeals for reinstatement were denied. In 1937, Massachusetts Governor Charles F. Hurley, after meeting with some of the 1919 strikers, backed the decision of Police Commissioner Joseph Timilty not to reinstate them.|$|E
5|$|Two of the American pilots, James McGovern, Jr., and Wallace Buford, {{were killed}} in action during the siege of Điện Biên Phủ. On 25 February 2005, the seven still living American pilots were awarded the French Legion of Honor by Jean-David Levitte, the French {{ambassador}} to the United States. The role that the American pilots played in this battle had remained little known until 2004. The American historian Erik Kirsinger researched the case for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> establish the facts.|$|E

5|$|In 1940 Horrocks {{commanded}} a battalion during the Battle of France, {{the first time}} he served under Bernard Montgomery, the most prominent British commander of the war. Montgomery later identified Horrocks as one of his most able officers, appointing him to corps commands in both North Africa and Europe. In 1943, Horrocks was seriously wounded and took more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> recover before returning to command a corps in Europe. It is likely that this period out of action meant he missed out on promotion; his contemporary corps commanders in North Africa, Oliver Leese and Miles Dempsey, went on to command at army level and above. Horrocks' wound caused continuing health problems and led to his early retirement from the army after the war.|$|E
5|$|Meat, {{mainly from}} farmed animals, {{is a major}} source of dietary protein around the world, {{averaging}} about 8% of man's energy intake. The actual types eaten depend on local preferences, availability, cost and other factors, with cattle, sheep, pigs and goats being the main species involved. Cattle generally produce a single offspring annually which takes more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> mature; sheep and goats often have twins and these are ready for slaughter in less than a year; pigs are more prolific, producing more than one litter of up to about 11 piglets each year. Horses, donkeys, deer, buffalo, llamas, alpacas, guanacos and vicunas are farmed for meat in various regions. Some desirable traits of animals raised for meat include fecundity, hardiness, fast growth rate, ease of management and high food conversion efficiency. About half of the world's meat is produced from animals grazing on open ranges or on enclosed pastures, the other half being produced intensively in various factory-farming systems; these are mostly cows, pigs or poultry, and often reared indoors, typically at high densities.|$|E
25|$|When {{elections}} for chief of state were convoked among the towns, Cornejo was the winner. He took {{possession of the}} government (still a state within the federation) on January 30, 1829 and governed {{for a little more}} <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>to</b> February 16, 1830.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 2010 many Maersk {{container}} ships {{had been}} built at Maersk's Odense Steel Shipyard in Denmark, but Asian builders had become more competitively priced. Maersk had approached several different builders in Asia, having ruled out European shipbuilders on grounds of cost, and Chinese on technological grounds. DSME builds three Triple-Es at a time, and it takes little more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> produce a ship.|$|E
25|$|The Congress {{took more}} <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> draft a new {{constitution}} and an electoral law for the 1981 presidential and congressional elections. The work went slowly, and the elections originally scheduled for August 1981 had to be postponed until November.

25|$|In December 2007, {{the hotel}} closed for a {{complete}} renovation, the cost of which was budgeted at £100million. The hotel conducted a sale of 3,000 pieces of its famous furnishings and memorabilia. The projected reopening date was delayed more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> October 2010, as structural and system problems held up construction. The building's façade required extensive stabilisation, {{and the cost of}} the renovations grew to £220million. The new energy-efficient design reduced the hotel's electricity usage by approximately 50% and reuse and recycling increased.|$|E
25|$|The British Army {{believed}} {{that the use of}} gas was needed, but did not use mustard gas until November 1917 at Cambrai, after their armies had captured a stockpile of German mustard-gas shells. It took the British more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> develop their own mustard gas weapon, with production of the chemicals centred on Avonmouth Docks. (The only option available to the British was the Despretz–Niemann–Guthrie process). This was used first in September 1918 during the breaking of the Hindenburg Line with the Hundred Days' Offensive.|$|E
25|$|Following 2000's Metal for the Brain, Alchemist {{went off}} the road for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> work on Austral Alien, which was {{released}} by Chatterbox in May 2003. This latest album showed a mellower side of Alchemist, with highly polished production and a heavily electronic sound. Influenced by the rock band Midnight Oil, the lyrics of the semi-conceptual album focused on environmental issues affecting their country, specifically the impact of man on the ecology. Alchemist added a fifth member, Nick Wall, to provide samples during live shows.|$|E

25|$|Instead, a much smaller, less {{powerful}} generator may be included {{which will take}} much longer to generate the total energy needed. This lower power is only sufficient to accelerate a tiny amount of fuel per second, and would be insufficient for launching from Earth. However, over long periods in orbit {{where there is no}} friction, the velocity will be finally achieved. For example, it took the SMART-1 more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> reach the Moon, whereas with a chemical rocket it takes a few days. Because the ion drive needs much less fuel, the total launched mass is usually lower, which typically results in a lower overall cost, but the journey takes longer.|$|E
25|$|The regime {{permitted}} non-deported Romanian Jews and American charities to send {{humanitarian aid}} into Transnistrian camps, a measure {{it took an}} interest in enforcing in late 1942. Deportations of Jews ceased altogether in October of the same year. A common explanation historians propose for this reassessment of policies is the change in Germany's fortunes on the Eastern Front, with mention that Antonescu was considering using the Jewish population as an asset in his dealings with the Western Allies. It nevertheless took the regime more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> allow more selective Jewish returns from Transnistria, including some 2,000 orphans. After Transnistria's 1944 evacuation, Antonescu himself advocated the creation of new camps in Bessarabia. In conversations with his cabinet, the Conducător angrily maintained that surviving Jews were better off than Romanian soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Watson {{then spent}} {{a very brief}} period selling sewing {{machines}} for Wheeler and Wilcox. According to Tom Watson, Jr., in his autobiography: One day my dad went into a roadside saloon to celebrate a sale and {{had too much to}} drink. When the bar closed, he found that his entire rig—horse, buggy, and samples—had been stolen. Wheeler and Wilcox fired him and dunned him for the lost property. Word got around, of course, and it took Dad more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> find another steady job. Watson would later enforce strict rules at IBM against alcohol consumption, even off the job. According to Tom Jr.: This anecdote never made it into IBM lore, which is too bad, because it would have helped explain Father to {{the tens of thousands of}} people who had to follow his rules.|$|E
