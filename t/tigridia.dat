500|$|Cash {{notes that}} when {{constructing}} his orrery, Horsefield asked a local man to manufacture a golden ball {{to represent the}} sun and the man replied that [...] "Aw'll mak' thee one an' charge thee now't for't; but, let me tell thee, fancy folk like thee 're a'lus poor". Indeed, he was: all of his interests were indulged despite a background of dire poverty, and he remarked of his celebrity in botanical circles that [...] "fame is not bread". He remained a gingham weaver and during his lifetime the sole financial benefit from his interests came when he raised a new hybrid lily– <b>Tigridia</b> conchiflora– in his garden and sold it to a Manchester nurseryman, Thomas Watkinson, for £10. His poverty caused him to be exempted from contributing to the book fund of the Prestwich Botanical Society from the mid-1820s, and he was later exempted from paying into the liquor funds of both that society and the wider-based group. These concessions demonstrate the extent to which his knowledge was appreciated and occurred despite the teetotal Hobson having to pay into a liquor fund of which by definition he took no advantage. Horsefield received £13 10s. from a subscription that was started in 1853 in another attempt to alleviate his penurious state. After his death on 6 March 1854, Esther, with whom he had six sons and five daughters, received £37 from this fund, and he left 37 bulbs of one of the earliest hybrid daffodils to be cultivated, Narcissus horsefieldii, that raised another £2 11s (£2.55). N. horsefieldii {{became one of the most}} popular and extensively grown varieties of daffodil.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tigridia</b> , {{the peacock}} flowers, tiger-flowers or shell flowers, is a genus of bulbous or cormous plants, {{belonging}} to the family Iridaceae. They have large showy flowers and one species, <b>Tigridia</b> pavonia, is often cultivated for this. The approximately thirty five species in this family grow in the Western Hemisphere, from Mexico to Chile. The <b>tigridia</b> flower is short lived, each often blooming for only one day, but often several flowers will bloom from the same stalk. Usually they are dormant during the winter dry-season. Its roots are edible and were eaten by the Aztecs of Mexico who called it cacomitl and its flower ocēlōxōchitl [...] "Jaguar flower". The genus name means [...] "tiger-like" [...] and alludes to the coloration and spotting of the flowers of the type species <b>Tigridia</b> pavonia.|$|E
