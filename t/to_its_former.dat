5|$|Christchurch's {{town centre}} {{encompasses}} {{a mixture of}} traditional public houses, restaurants, coffee shops, antiquated cottages and historic listed buildings. The older part of the town dates from Saxon times and retains its Saxon street layout. The Grade II listed Mayor's Parlour was built as the market hall in 1745 {{at the far end}} of the High Street but was moved to its present position in 1849. It was enclosed and extended, and used as the town hall until the civic offices were built in the mid-1970s.

5|$|In 1961, {{when the}} I-96/US16/M-50 freeway was {{extended}} to the northwest in Grand Rapids, the old M-50 routing around the city became M-11 and M-50 was returned <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>former</b> alignment along Lake Michigan Drive and Fulton Street, supplanting Bus. M-50. In 1964, {{the western end of}} M-50 was truncated from its junction with US31 back to I-96 south of Lowell at exit52. The former alignment from exit40 to Agnew was given the M-45 designation.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, US163 was {{designated}} along SR464 in Arizona and SR47 in Utah {{as part of}} a re-alignment of U.S. highways in the Four Corners region. With the re-alignment, US160 was re-routed into Arizona instead of Utah. US163 also absorbed the former route of US160 <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>former</b> terminus at Interstate 70 at Crescent Junction. In 1981, AASHTO approved a new iteration of U.S. Route 191 that absorbed much of the alignment of US163. Utah truncated US163 at Bluff. The truncation was made without approval from AASHTO, as the AASHTO logs placed the northern terminus of US163 at I-70 at Crescent Junction.|$|E

5|$|Melatonin is a {{powerful}} antioxidant. Melatonin easily crosses cell membranes and the blood–brain barrier. Unlike other antioxidants, melatonin does not undergo redox cycling, which {{is the ability of}} a molecule to undergo repeated reduction and oxidation. Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as pro-oxidants and promote free radical formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>former</b> state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.|$|E
