This erratum is submitted in order to correct an error in the <b>tap</b> <b>sequence</b> of the filtering function in Decim- 128 specifications. 1 Erratum to the Decim- 128 specifications An error in the Decim- 128 specifications [3] was recently noticed. The choice of taps for the filtering function in Decim- 128 does not fulfill the guidelines from both Decim [1] and Decim v 2 [2], stating that ”each difference between two positions of bits that are input to f should appear only once; ”- meaning that the <b>tap</b> <b>sequence</b> of the filtering function must be a full positive difference set. Indeed, in the <b>tap</b> <b>sequence</b> of the filtering function in Decim- 128, the pairs of tap positions (203, 263) and (227, 287) both have distance 60, so the <b>tap</b> <b>sequence</b> is not a full positive difference set.

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} is to focus on {{reducing}} test pattern with effective Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) reseeding. Test data volume of modern devices for testing increases rapidly corresponding to the size and complexity of the Systems-on-Chip (SoC). LFSR is a good pseudorandom pattern generator, which generates all possible test vectors with the help of the <b>tap</b> <b>sequence.</b> It can achieve high fault coverage by reducing correlation between the test vectors. Reseeding is a powerful method for reducing the test data volume and storage. This study presents a new LFSR reseeding technique for efficient reduction of test pattern. A new encoding technique is proposed in this study which is used to reduce the size of the test data. Size of the test data can be reduced by LFSR clock which is inactive for several clock cycles after the input seed is given. When the clock goes to inactive state, a rotate right shift operation is done on the seed to get all the remaining possible values. After getting all the possible values for that seed a new seed is given by making the clock active. Test data volume is reduced by storing the data only when the clock is active. With in the reduced clocks, rest of all the remaining test vectors was derived. A special Control logic is used to make the clock active as well as inactive. Experimental results are targeted to ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits...|$|E

H 577 M RS 2016 Wangxi, 125 pages :color illustrationsSensorimotor {{processing}} begins from stimulus onset to movement onset {{and contains}} separate but partially overlapping stages, including stimulus perception, response selection, and motor response generation. Different factors may modulate {{different stages of}} sensorimotor processing. The current study aimed to explore the changes in stimulus-induced motor preparation and execution associated with aging and how different factors, such as laterality and complexity of sequence finger movements, modulate these age-related changes on movement preparation. We hypothesized that aging would affect performance on finger-tapping tasks in the late response selection stage and that the motor response generation stage and factors, such as sequence length and complexity, would affect motor preparation processing. We studied a total of 41 right-handed volunteers [20 younger subjects aged (mean ± SD) 24. 1 ± 3. 6 years and 21 older subjects aged 63. 4 ± 3. 1 years]. Both block-based choice-reaction and simple-reaction tasks were used in this study. Reaction time (RT), accuracy rate (ACC), and electroencephalography (EEG) were recorded during task performance. The behavioral results of the CRT tasks showed an overall slowness in RT in the older groups compared with the younger groups (p 0. 050). The s-LRP results suggested that would influence less on the association of the shape-and-arrow configurations with the specific finger <b>tapping</b> <b>sequence,</b> {{as well as the}} response selection processes. The age-related difference in the onset latency of r-LRP suggests that aging may have had an effect on the motor response generation stage. For the right-handinitiated <b>tapping</b> <b>sequence,</b> extra-neural activity from the contralateral motor cortex was required for movement execution in older subjects. The prolonged onset latency of r-LRP on the left-hand-initiated <b>tapping</b> <b>sequence</b> of older group demonstrated that the contralateral brain cortex was recruited more for non-dominant hand side movement in the older group when movement planning and execution processes were needed for a given task. The longer r-LRP raising time for right-hand-initiated movements represented a stronger facilitation for left hand movement that originated from the right hemisphere. The delayed latency and reduced amplitude of r-LRP with aging may indicate a top-down regulation and functional facilitation. The results of the r-LRP also suggested decreased inter-hemispheric differences due to increased inhibitory control from the contralateral hemisphere. Department of Rehabilitation SciencesM.

40|$|There is now convincing {{evidence}} that the human Tap protein plays {{a critical role in}} mediating the nuclear export of mRNAs that contain the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus constitutive transport element (CTE) and significant evidence that Tap also participates in global poly(A) + RNA export. Previously, we had mapped carboxy-terminal sequences in Tap that serve as an essential nucleocytoplasmic shuttling domain, while others had defined an overlapping <b>Tap</b> <b>sequence</b> that can bind to the FG repeat domains of certain nucleoporins. Here, we demonstrate that these two biological activities are functionally correlated. Specifically, mutations in Tap that block nucleoporin binding also block both nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and the Tap-dependent nuclear export of CTE-containing RNAs. In contrast, mutations that do not inhibit nucleoporin binding also fail to affect Tap shuttling. Together, these data indicate that Tap belongs to a novel class of RNA export factors that can target bound RNA molecules directly to the nuclear pore without the assistance of an importin β-like cofactor. In addition to nucleoporins, Tap has also been proposed to interact with a cellular cofactor termed p 15. Although we were able to confirm that Tap can indeed bind p 15 specifically both in vivo and in vitro, a mutation in Tap that blocked p 15 binding only modestly inhibited CTE-dependent nuclear RNA export. However, p 15 did significantly enhance the affinity of Tap for the CTE in vitro and readily formed a ternary complex with Tap on the CTE. This result suggests that p 15 may {{play a significant role in}} the recruitment of the Tap nuclear export factor to target RNA molecules in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} of the two cerebral hemispheres for temporal processing was investigated in two experiments concerned with sensory and motor processing, respectively. The temporal processing of sensory information was examined in a task requiring simultaneity judgement of pairs of tactile stimuli delivered unimanually or bimanually. Unimanual stimulation permitted presentation of both events to the same hemisphere while bimanual stimulation involved both hemispheres and necessarily required interhemispheric communication to compare stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). The order of presentation of asynchronous pairs determined which cerebral hemisphere was activated first. Pairs of stimuli were judged as simultaneous at longer SOAs in the bimanual than the unimanual conditions whilst unimanual left and right simultaneity thresholds did not differ. These {{results suggest that the}} two hemispheres are equally capable of temporally resolving a pair of simple tactile stimuli. A structural model proposing that temporal comparisons are carried out in the hemisphere receiving the second stimulus provides the best account of the results. The temporal processing of motor information was examined in a task requiring the planning and execution of sequences of finger movements. A predetermined number of double-tap responses with the index and middle fingers of a given hand were required in response to a visual cue in the ipsilateral visual field. The restriction of the performance cue in each trial to the hemisphere controlling the response permitted assessment of the contribution of each cerebral hemisphere to differences in hand skill. Movement time increased linearly for both hands with increasing length of <b>tap</b> <b>sequence</b> and did not differentiate hand performance. Response preparation time, however, increased linearly with increasing task load for the preferred hand but varied quadratically for the non-preferred hand. These results indicate that differences in hand skill may be determined by the mode of response preparation within the contralateral hemisphere. They also suggest that studies of hand differences involving fixed levels of motor demand would not properly differentiate hand performance. Together, these studies indicate that both cerebral hemispheres are capable of the temporal processing of sensory and motor information but that the hemisphere primarily involved is determined by side of stimulus or response, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Cytotoxic T {{lymphocytes}} (CTLs) are activated to kill virally infected cells by {{the recognition}} of viral peptides presented on the cell surface by major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecules. Peptides are generated by proteasOIpal degradation of viral proteins in the cytosol, and then translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Here, peptides are loaded onto newly synthesised MHC class I molecules, before trafficking ') to the cell surface. Clearly it is advantageous' for viruses to inhibit cell- surface expression of MHC class I, as this enables them to avoid a CTL response. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes US 6, an ER resident glycoprotein that inhibits peptide translocation by TAP. HCMV US 6 prevents ATP binding by TAP, effectively starving the transporter of its energy source, and cutting off the supply of peptides for loading onto MHC class I molecules. The mechanism through which HCMV US 6 inhibits ATP binding by TAP is poorly understood, nor is it clear how HCMV US 6 localises to the ER. Thus the aims {{of this study were}} three-fold. ' Firstly, to further investigate HCMV US 6 inhibition of MHC class I cell surface expression, in particular its interactions with TAP. Secondly, to characterise a chimpanzee cytomegalovirus (CCMV) homologue of HCMV US 6, in order to identify conserved residues required for TAP inhibition. Thirdly, to ~nvestigate interactions that may mediate HCMV US 6 localisation to the ER. A flow cytometricÃ‚Â· assay for TAP activity was developed in which cell surface expression of the TAP-depe. ndent allele HLA-B 2705 was measured. Using a series of HCMV US 6 truncations and site directed mutants in this assay it was demonstrated that that residues 89 - 104 ofHCMV US 6 are required for TAP inhibition. Additionally, two separate regions of HCMV US 6 stabilise the interaction with TAP; one at the Nterminus comprising residues 81 - 89, and another at the C-terminus ofHCMV US 6. In contrast CCMV US 6 had no effect on HLA-B 2705 expression and could not inhibit ATP binding by human <b>TAP.</b> <b>Sequence</b> alignments indicated that CCMV US 6 differs from HCMV US 6 in seven of the sixteen residues required for TAP inhibition, corresponding to residues 89 - 104 ofHCMV US 6. Site directed mutagenesis was used to create a CCMV US 6 molecule that was identical to HCMV US 6 in fifteen of the sixteen residues required for TAP inhibition. Significantly this chimeric US 6 protein reduced cell surface expression of HLA-B 2705, and inhibited ATP binding by TAP. Overall, these data provide further insight into the molecular interactions between HCMV US 6 and TAP, from which a possible mechanism ofinhibition can be proposed. Previously published work revealed that HCMV US 6 binds both TAP and the ER chaperone calnexin. To investigate if either of these interactions was required for HCMV US 6 localisation to the ER, TAP-deficient, and calnexin-deficient cell lines were utilised. In both of these cell types HCMV US 6 localised to the ER, suggesting that neither TAP nor calnexin was, by itself, required to retain HCMV US 6 in the ER. Additionally, the intracellular localisation of a HCMV US 6 truncation series was assessed to map the sequence requirements for ER localisation; however this could not be conclusively defined.

MethodsSixteen young men participated in two experimental conditions, each of which lasted for 3 consecutive days and nights in our laboratory: a short sleep schedule (4. 25 -h sleep opportunity per night) versus a normal sleep schedule (8. 5 h per night). In the evening after two experimental nights, participants learned locations of 15 card pairs (spatial memory task) and a procedural finger <b>tapping</b> <b>sequence</b> task. Post-sleep retrieval of both memory tasks was tested the next morning. ResultsThe short sleep schedule, compared with the normal sleep schedule, considerably altered sleep characteristics, e. g. the proportion of time in slow-wave sleep increased across the three experimental nights. In contrast, neither learning in the evening of day 2, nor subsequent overnight memory consolidation (i. e. concerning the change in memory performance between pre-sleep learning on day 2 and post-sleep retrieval on day 3) differed between the normal and short sleep schedule conditions. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that learning in the evening and subsequent sleep-dependent consolidation of procedural and spatial memories are unaltered in young men living under a fixed short sleep schedule. Future studies are warranted to validate our findings in other groups (e. g. adolescents and older subjects) and after more prolonged chronic sleep loss paradigms...|$|R
