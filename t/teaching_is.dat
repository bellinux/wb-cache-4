There are also many private music schools and workshops for instrument building and repair. Private <b>teaching</b> <b>is</b> also quite common in Italy. Elementary {{and high school students}} can expect to have one or two weekly hours of music teaching, generally in choral singing and basic music theory, though extracurricular opportunities are rare. Though most Italian universities have classes in related subjects such as music history, performance is not a common feature of university education.|$|E

Local NGO interlocutors confirmed that although students took part in a prayer session each morning, it was nondenominational and not compulsory.|$|R

25|$|<b>Teaching</b> <b>is</b> undervalued and underpaid as a {{profession}} and this was not helped by the selection procedure. Prior to 2010, students with lower achievement at grade 10 {{could go to a}} Teacher Training Institute (TTI) or a College of Teacher's Education (CTE) for a certificate or diploma. If students passed the EHEEE, education faculties took students with lower GPAs than other faculties. <b>Teaching</b> <b>is</b> hard work with high mean pupil/teacher ratios in primary schools and many operating a double shift. Many teachers lack motivation and 60% would move to another job if given the opportunity.|$|E
