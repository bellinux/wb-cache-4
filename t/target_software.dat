50|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} to virtualize disk and tape targets. Rather than representing an actual physical device, an emulated virtual device is presented. The underlying implementation can deviate drastically from the presented target as is done with virtual tape library (VTL) products. VTLs use disk storage for storing data written to virtual tapes. As with actual physical devices, virtual targets are presented by using iSCSI <b>target</b> <b>software,</b> external bridges, or controllers internal to the device enclosure.|$|E
