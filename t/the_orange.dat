50|$|In {{linguistic}} typology, object-verb-subject (OVS) or object-verb-agent (OVA) {{is a rare}} permutation of word order. OVS {{denotes the}} sequence object-verb-subject in unmarked expressions: Oranges ate Sam, Thorns have roses. While the passive voice in English {{may appear to be}} in the OVS order, this is not an accurate description. In an active voice sentence, for example Sam ate <b>the</b> <b>oranges,</b> <b>the</b> grammatical subject, Sam, is the 'agent', who is acting on <b>the</b> 'patient,' <b>the</b> <b>oranges,</b> which are <b>the</b> object of the verb ate. In the passive voice, <b>The</b> <b>oranges</b> were eaten by Sam, the order is reversed so that patient is followed by verb, followed by agent. However, <b>the</b> <b>oranges</b> become <b>the</b> subject of the verb were eaten which is modified by the prepositional phrase by Sam, which expresses the agent, maintaining the usual subject-verb-(object) order.|$|R
5|$|The Hokies played <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Bowl without {{starting}} linebacker Lyndell Gibson, who fractured {{his shoulder}} {{in the second}} quarter of the ACC Championship Game.

The Hokies also returned a player from injury for <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Bowl. Linebacker Barquell Rivers, who had been predicted to be Tech's starting middle linebacker, suffered a torn quadriceps tendon in offseason workouts, causing him to miss every game. Heading into <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Bowl, coaches were optimistic that he had healed enough to be able to play.|$|E
5|$|As {{champions of}} the Atlantic Coast Conference, Virginia Tech was awarded an {{automatic}} bid to <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Bowl game.

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the regular season before <b>the</b> <b>Orange</b> Bowl, Virginia Tech's offense was ranked among the worst in Division I, 107th among 119teams.
