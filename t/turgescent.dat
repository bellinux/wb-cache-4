50|$|The {{species is}} adapted to sunny and warm sites on dry, mostly on sandy and stony loamy soil. During the first {{vegetation}} period, only the leaf rosette is developed, flowering follows during the second vegetation period. Therefore, especially during the first year, {{there is a high}} resistance against water stress (drought stress). Indeed, the leaves remain <b>turgescent</b> even under very low leaf water potential, due to osmotic adaptation by synthesis of non-ionic substances in the leaves. The drought induced diminishing of photosynthesis is reversible after a few hours following watering of the plants. Drought stress also reduces the quantum yield of photosystem 2. More than 70 bitter glycosides with cardiac activity, with five different aglyconees digitoxigenin, gitoxigenin, digoxigenin, diginatigenin and gitaloxigenin in the leaves act as a protection against herbivores. Yield and concentration of these cardiac glycosides are enhanced by greenhouse cultivation through enhanced temperature and enhanced carbon dioxide concentration.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo follow {{endocytosis}} in BY- 2 cells we {{made use}} of fluorescent nano beads. Beads with 20 nm in diameter were internalised rapidly and accumulated partially in compartments also labelled by the endocytic marker FM 4 - 64. Studies in BY- 2 cells and protoplasts revealed that larger beads (100 nm) were excluded from uptake into <b>turgescent</b> and plasmolysed cells while protoplasts were able to internalise beads with a diameter of up to 1000 nm. Endocytosis of beads was only partially inhibited by the clathrin-specific inhibitor Ikarugamycin and strongly blocked by wortmannin. These results imply that uptake of beads involves clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytic mechanisms and supports the hypothesis that clathrin-independent endocytosis plays a general role in plants...|$|E
40|$|This {{study reveals}} {{in detail the}} {{mechanism}} of self-repair during secondary growth in the vines Aristolochia macrophylla and Aristolochia ringens based on morphological data. For a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms during the self-repair of lesions in the sclerenchymatous cylinder of the stem, which are caused by internal growth stresses, a classification of morphological changes in the cells involved in the repair process is required. In {{an early stage of}} self-repair, we observed morphological changes as a mere extension of the <b>turgescent</b> cortex cells surrounding the lesion, whereby the cell wall extends locally through visco-elastic/plastic deformation without observable cell wall synthesis. Later stages involve typical cell growth and cell division. Several successive phases of self-repair were investigated by light microscopy of stained samples and confocal laser-scanning microscopy in fluorescence mode. The results indicate that A. macrophylla and A. ringens respond to lesions caused by internal growth stresses with a sophisticated self-repair mechanism comprising several phases of different repair modes...|$|E
40|$|The enzymatic texture loss during apple {{maceration}} was {{studied by}} two micro-mechanical techniques. The first technique {{consisted of a}} 5 % strain compression cycles at a strain rate of 4. 5 x 10 4 s - 1. The second technique consisted on micro-puncture of the apple parenchyma with a small needle. The first technique led to the peripheral tissues degradation modelling with a first order kinetic reaction or a more pertinent Weibull function. The second technique evidenced that the jagged part of the load vs penetration curve corresponded to an interaction between the needle tip and the <b>turgescent</b> apple texture and the fractal dimension of this jagged part {{was chosen as the}} texture parameter. Modelling the enzyme diffusion phenomenon with the second Fick’s law and taking into account the model previously established on peripheral tissues allowed the estimation of an equivalent enzyme diffusivity through the apple parenchyma varying between 3. 5 x 10 - 11 and 5. 5 x 10 - 11 m 2 s- 1...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous {{growth of}} {{isolated}} inner tissue from the etiolated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) hypocotyl growing zone was investigated. A new preparation technique allowed measurements starting 3 s after excision. Elongation {{with respect to}} the <b>turgescent</b> and plasmolized state was quantified in terms of relative growth rates, facilitating comparison to growth in situ. Turgor and turgor-induced strain were determined. Overall longitudinal strain in inner tissues in situ was positive, indicating that compressive forces exerted by peripheral tissues are outweighed by turgor-dependent tensile stress. Inner tissue expansion following isolation depended on water uptake. Extreme plastic extension rates occurred immediately after excision, suggesting that mechanical parameters of inner tissue in situ cannot be extrapolated from the mechanics of excised sections. In the long term, excised inner tissue autonomously established values of turgor, turgor-induced strain, and relative growth rates similar to values in the living plant. These results support historic models of tissue cooperation during organ growth, in which inner tissues actively participate in the control of growth rates...|$|E
40|$|Relative {{changes in}} cell turgor of leaves of well-watered tomato plants were {{evaluated}} using the leaf patch clamp pressure probe (LPCP) under dynamic greenhouse climate conditions. Leaf patch clamp pressure changes, a measure for relative changes in cell turgor, were monitored at three different heights of transpiring and non-transpiring leaves of tomato plants on sunny and cloudy days simultaneously with whole plant water uptake. Clear diel patterns were observed for relative changes of cell turgor of both transpiring and non-transpiring leaves, which were stronger on sunny days than on cloudy days. A clear effect of canopy height was also observed. Non-transpiring leaves showed relative changes in cell turgor that closely followed plant water uptake throughout the day. However, {{in the afternoon}} the relative changes of cell turgor of the transpiring leaves displayed a delayed response in comparison to plant water uptake. Subsequent recovery of cell turgor loss of transpiring leaves during the following night appeared insufficient, as the pre-dawn <b>turgescent</b> state similar to the previous night was not attaine...|$|E
40|$|Neem (Azadirachta indica) is a {{valuable}} multipurpose tree of tropical arid and semi-arid regions. The use of its seeds is hindered by their short storage longevity. The possible causes of rapid loss of viability were investigated on different seed lots during exposure to 32 % and 75 % RH at 20 °C. Within 6 months the seeds almost lost germinability at 75 % RH, whereas at 32 % RH viability decreased only slightly. On rehydration, the axis cells from nongerminable seeds had lost turgor, whereas those from viable seeds were <b>turgescent</b> as visualized by low temperature scanning electron microscopy images of fractured axes. Glutathione oxidation status was used to estimate oxidative stress during storage. Oxidative stress was much higher at 75 % RH storage than at 32 % RH, mainly caused by the rapid loss of reduced glutathione at 75 % RH. Oligosaccharides and phospholipids decreased, and free fatty acids increased during storage at the high RH but remained at a constant level at the low RH. However, the degree of fatty acid unsaturation between viable and nonviable seed lots was similar. During the (slow) dehydration of fresh seeds, total glutathione, oligosaccharides and phospholipids accumulated, particularly in the initially more hydrated seeds. We interpret this accumulation as a post-maturation process associated with acquisition of the capability for long-term survival in the dry state. The mass ratio of oligosaccharides to sucrose was 0. 19 on average in dehydrated neem seeds. The {{data suggest that the}} storage behaviour of neem seeds has features that characterize it as orthodox...|$|E
40|$|Drought is a serious, {{worldwide}} {{problem for}} crop production and also affects yields of barley and wheat, {{together with other}} stressors such as frost, viral diseases, or fungal pathogens. Although a number of candidate genes have been identified by transcriptome approaches in recent years, only very few have been tested in functional assays for a beneficial effect on drought tolerance. Here, a transient assay system in microprojectile-bombarded barley leaves is described that allows the functional testing of dehydration stress-related candidate genes by RNA interference (RNAi) or overexpression. Cellular stress or damage in dedydrated leaves is reported by a reduced accumulation of slowly maturing, native red-fluorescing protein DsRed that {{is known to be}} sensitive to denaturing conditions. After a dehydration-stress period of 4 [*]d during which the relative fresh weight of leaves was kept at 60 – 66 % of initial fresh weight, a reproducible reduction of normalized DsRed fluorescence was observed. In order to obtain proof of concept, a number of barley mRNAs homologous to drought response genes were selected and targeted by transient induced gene silencing (TIGS). TIGS of four tested genes resulted in a significantly stronger decrease of normalized DsRed fluorescence in dehydration-stressed leaves, whereas they had no effect in fully <b>turgescent</b> control leaves. These genes encode barley drought-responsive factor HvDRF 1 (DREB 2 -like), dehydrin 6, late embryogenesis-abundant protein HVA 1, and the vacuolar sodium/proton antiporter HvHNX 1. The four targeted transcripts were also found to accumulate rapidly in dehydration-stressed barley leaf segments. The results suggest a value of the TIGS system for functional pre-screening of larger numbers of drought or dehydration stress-related candidate genes in barley...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} sexual behaviour and the ovarian cycle in a group-living primate, Papio h. hamadryas. Of particular interest is whether females modify their ovarian cycle {{in a manner that}} is expected increase their reproductive success. The study was conducted on a captive colony where the resident males (RM) had been vasectomised prior to start of the study resulting in all mature females undergoing repeated ovarian cycling throughout the study period. This made the analysis of sexual behaviour relative to fine scale changes in the ovarian cycle possible. One year of ovarian cycle data and 280 hours of behavioural data was collected via observational sampling during the study. RM vasectomisation did not alter the archetypal one male unit social structure nor the typical socio-spatial organisation of wild hamadryas populations. Females were found to be more promiscuous than in wild populations, however, presumably because of the confounding effect that the high number of simultaneously cycling females had on RM herding (Chapter 1). RMs dominated copulations over the optimal conceptive period of the ovarian cycle, while the majority of extra-OMU copulations occurred outside this period and were rarely solicited by females. This pattern supports a dual paternity concentration/paternity confusion strategy, and not female choice or fertility insurance strategies (Chapter 2). Females were not found to synchronise or asynchronise their cycles over the 1 year study period, although a review of the literature on hamadryas breeding patterns suggests that they may be able to do so over shorter periods (Chapter 3). Females did, however, appear to regulate the length of the <b>turgescent</b> phase of their ovarian cycle in a manner that would facilitate a paternity confusion strategy and maximise their expected fitness payoff (Chapter 4). Consequently, this study provides empirical evidence that female hamadryas baboons manipulate their ovarian cycle {{in a manner that is}} expected to increase their reproductive success...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} flower bulbs and {{herbaceous}} perennials in consumer packages declines rapidly due to sprouting and drying out. The {{present study was}} undertaken to develop Modified Atmosphere Packages (MAP) with suitable filling materials for a prolonged shelf life of different species of flower bulbs (e. g., Lilium, Anemone, Erythronium) and herbaceous perennials (e. g., Hemerocallis, Hosta, Phlox). As filling materials peat moss and Toresa (wood fiber) were tested. So-called continuous MA films were used, i. e., without laser holes, {{which means that they}} are virtually impermeable to water. The shelf life of plants and bulbs was tested in packages produced from these films after addition of filling materials with different moisture contents. The shelf life was determined in a climate chamber at 23 °C with a high ventilation rate. The same products were packed in traditional packages with microperforation for comparison. The shelf life of bulbs and perennials was extended dramatically from 3 to 4 weeks in the traditional package with microperforation to 2 to 3 months by the use of MA packaging. It was however not the low oxygen level inside the packages that caused this effect but the reduction of water loss by using MA films. In microperforation packages the products dried out completely in 3 to 4 weeks, whereas in the MA packages the products remained <b>turgescent</b> and vital for 2 to 3 months. Sprouting was inhibited by using dry filling materials. The term Modified Humidity Packaging therefore seems to be more appropriate for this type of packaging. To prevent too low oxygen levels inside MA packages it is recommended to use an MA film with a high permeability for oxygen. This also enables the use of one film {{for a wide range of}} products...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} {{mycorrhizal}} activity {{was conducted in}} a mature Norway spruce ((Picea abies) [L. ] Karst.) stand subjected to soil treatments of liming and acidification for six years (Hoglwald research project). Samples were collected five times during one growing season using a soil corer. All the <b>turgescent,</b> not shriveled mycorrhizal tips were sorted out and identified on the fungal species level as far as yet possible. The proportion of each mycorrhizal type on the plots was calculated. The results revealed {{a shift in the}} mycorrhizal communities caused by both acid rain and liming. Data are in agreement with the findings of the more comprehensive study on the mycorrhizal communities carried out by another research group on the same plots (Taylor et al., submitted). The activity of the predominant types of mycorrhizas, Piceirhiza gelatinosa, Piceirhiza nigra, Russula achraleuca-P. abies, Tuber puberulum-P. abies, Tylospora sp. -P. abies, Xerocomus badius-P. abies, was investigated by staining hand sectioned tips with FDA and their fluorescence. Different FDA-hydrolysing activities of the mycorrhizal types had been found in a previous-year study on the same plots and were confirmed during the second year. The proportion of the different stages of activity of the mycorrhizal tissues was calculated on the type level and in connection to the soil treatments. X. badius-P. abies and R. ochroleuca-P. abies displayed the most active fungal tissues and proportion increased on the acidic plots while Tuber puberulum-P. abies and Piceirhiza nigra were the most active types and occurred in higher proportion after liming. Thus, the overall activities of the mycorrhizas were only slightly changed by the treatments. In addition to the mycorrhizal effect acidification reduced while liming enhanced the meristematic activity of the short root tips. The same tendency was found by studying root production on the same plots (Hahn and Marschner, 1998). Although nearly 3000 mycorrhizal tips were studied, the data are still limited, allowing no statistical validation. This is, however, the first investigation connecting overall activity of the mycorrhizal tissues with the proportion of the mycorrhizal types as influenced both by alterations of the forest soil caused by acid rain and liming. The results are interesting and reasonable but further investments are necessary to validate the general conclusions...|$|E
40|$|The {{roles of}} the cell wall and {{cytoskeleton}} in cell differentiation of Metarhizium anisopliae were examined by treating germlings with antagonists of wall formation or with drugs which bind to microtubules and filamentous actin. Evidence for the greater plasticity of the appressorial wall compared with nongrowing regions comes from differential staining with fluorescent brighteners (Uvitex and Calcofluor) and fluorescently labeled wheat germ agglutinin; agents which detect chitin. Sorbose, which interferes with primary wall formation, was a potent inhibitor of differentiation which indicates that formation of appressoria involves addition of materials to the wall which matches the wall extension. Treatment with the anti-microfilament agent, cytochalasin A, disrupted polar growth and produced “ballooning” of the hyphal tip, indicating that actin stabilizes the tip against turgor pressure and {{may be involved in}} the transition to nonpolar growth of appressoria. Flooding differentiated germlings with 0. 5 % acetic acid produced bursting of appressoria and extrusion of the cytoplasm, indicating that growing appressoria are also <b>turgescent</b> and that internal hydrostatic pressure is a component in their growth. The effects of anti-microtubule agents are consistent with the well-known role for microtubules in the transport of vesicles. Taken together, our studies indicate that the microtubule-microfilament network is involved in the mediation of extracellular signals but not in initial reception. Inhibition of differentiation by vanadate (an inhibitor of the plasma membrane ATPase) and gadilonium (a blocker of stretch-activated ion channels) implies that changes in membrane potential {{may play a role in}} signal reception. We propose a model for the sequence of events during differentiation in which an induction signal, perhaps involving a localized change in transmembrane potential produced by deformation of the plastic hyphal tip, disrupts the apical Ca 2 + gradient required for maintenance of polar growth and the actin cytoskeleton, the consequent differential redistribution of Ca 2 + in the cell enlargement zone initiates germ tube swelling and appressorium formation by turgor pressure against an expanded area of the cell wall produced by disruption of exocytosis at the original apex and randomly dispersed intussusception of new wall material over the entire cell surface. A possible role for the Spitzenkörper (vesicle generating apparatus) is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Texture is an {{important}} quality parameter in fresh horticultural products. However, its complexity and variability entails that instrumental analyses describe it only partial whereas various properties are involved. For example, product water status, cell wall physical properties and tissue structure interdependently determine compressive and tensile strength, and elastic properties, which all together characterise texture. Furthermore, short-term effects on texture under unfavourable conditions during shelf five may be functionally different from those occurring during long-term storage. During recent years, new methods such as the acoustic impulse-response technique have become available to non-destructively analyse the elastic texture components. In addition, water potential, osmotic potential and turgor can be non-destructively assessed with the pressure bomb in combination with pressure volume analyses in many products. An experiment was designed to comprehensively {{study the effects of}} water status on different tissue elastic parameters. Water potential (Psi), fresh mass, apparent elastic modulus (E, quasi-static compression test), and stiffness factor (S, acoustic impulse-response test) were repeatedly determined on radish tubers during desiccation by free transpiration. E showed a two-phased linear relationship with Psi. At water potentials beyond the turgor-loss-region, the slope of this relationship largely declined. In <b>turgescent</b> tubers a considerable part of the variation of E could be explained by water potential. S showed a less clear two-phased relation and wilting seems to exhibit only minor effects on stiffness. Both E and S increased linearly with pressure potential but S showed a weaker correlation with turgor. While the decline in acoustic stiffness with increasing relative water deficit seemed to follow an exponential model, the correlation between E and RWD could be best described by a power function. E and S increased with increasing volumetric modulus of elasticity (epsilon) in a curvilinear manner. When E and S were compared directly, a curvilinear correlation was found. These results show that S is a good indicator for changes in produce water content. Both parameters are useful to indicate postharvest texture changes. However, the results point toward the possibility, that S is less related to short-term changes of product rigidity than E. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Stem {{sap flow}} (Q) and leaf turgor {{pressure}} (P c) were measured simultaneously on 4 -year-old, 2. 4 m tall 'Arbequina' olive trees in a hedgerow orchard. Measurements {{were performed on}} well-watered control trees {{as well as on}} 60 RDI and 30 RDI trees (RDI=regulated deficit irrigation). The 60 RDI trees received 59. 2 % of the crop water needs (ET c), and the 30 RDI trees received 29. 4 % of ET c. P c was determined non-invasively using the magnetic leaf patch clamp pressure probe (ZIM probe). The patch pressure P p measured by the probe is inversely correlated with turgor pressure at P c>ca. 50 kPa. P c is coupled with xylem pressure; thus P p yields information about the development of tension in xylem. In the case of the control trees a positive correlation between Q and P p was generally found, i. e. Q increased usually with increasing P p and decreased with decreasing P p, as expected. However, Q peaking did not always coincided with P p peaking at noon. Occasionally, Q peaking preceded or followed P p peaking with a time difference of up to 3 h in both cases. Under some circumstances, the onset of Q after sunrise was greatly delayed, even though a pronounced increase of P p was observed. A delayed onset of Q after sunrise resulted in hysteresis phenomena, i. e. the linear increase of Q and P p in the morning hours did not coincide with the corresponding decrease of Q and P p in the afternoon. The development of severe water stress (P c<ca. 50 kPa) associated with the increase in the intercellular spaces of the spongy tissue in the leaves resulted in inverted diurnal P p curves, i. e. minimum P p values were recorded at noon and maximum P p values during the night on the 30 RDI trees. The effects were reversible as shown by re-watering. By contrast, the magnitude of Q decreased continuously from the <b>turgescent</b> state to the state of severe water stress; maximum Q values were still recorded around noon. The data suggests that short-range tension forces are responsible for water lifting in olive trees and that water uptake from water storage reservoirs must {{play an important role in}} the supply of the leaves with water. Furthermore, for setting of irrigation thresholds the finding of shape changes of the P p curves upon severe water stress seems to be a useful indicator. Such shape changes are detected and monitored more sensitively than changes in the magnitude of sap flow rates or of turgor pressure. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Stomata {{are found}} in the {{epidermis}} of photosynthetic active plant organs. They are formed by pairs of guard cells which create a pore to facilitate CO 2 and water exchange with the environment. In order to control this gas exchange, guard cells actively change their volume and, consequently, surface area to alter the aperture of the stomatal pore. These changes are achieved by an uptake or release of K+ through K+-selective channels followed by the respective osmotic water fluxes. The quantification of such osmotically driven changes on 3 D reconstructions revealed that guard cells of open and closed stomata of Vicia faba L., which show a 50 % change in aperture, differ in volume and surface area by 25 % and 15 %, respectively. Since biological membranes only have a limited elasticity of about 2 %, such excursions in surface area during stomatal movement require an addition or retrieval of membrane to or from the plasma membrane (PM). However, the relevance of endocytosis in plants has frequently been questioned on the basis of energetic considerations, because high turgor poses a barrier on the budding of the PM into vesicles. To investigate this process in highly <b>turgescent</b> guard cells, the dynamics of the PM were examined by monitoring with confocal microscopy the fate of membrane-affine styryl dyes (FM 4 - 64, FM 2 - 10, FM 1 - 43) and the fluid-affine dye Alexa 488 hydrazide under natural and constant osmotic conditions. As a third marker, a relevant transporter for stomatal function was observed by following the retrieval of a fluorescent chimera of the K+-channel KAT 1 (KAT 1 ::GFP). Over some minutes of incubation in FM-dyes, endocytic vesicles in the cortical cytoplasm beneath the PMwere fluorescently labelled. The identification was based on the observation that the size distribution of these structures is very similar to that of endocytic vesicles obtained from patch-clamp capacitance recordings. All markers, whether membrane- (FM-dyes, KAT 1 ::GFP) or fluid-phase-affine (Alexa 488 hydrazide), are taken up into structures of diffraction-limited size and similar localisation in the cortical cytoplasm. The calculated size of Alexa 488 hydrazide labelled structures was 60 - 80 nm. This is well in accordance with sizes reported for clathrin-coated vesicles in plants. Moreover, a subset of single vesicles was labelled with the externally supplied membrane marker FM 4 - 64 and the intracellular produced KAT 1 ::GFP. Consequently these vesicles carry K+-channels, which had already been delivered to the PM and are now retrieved via endocytosis. To summarize, the data provide strong evidence that turgid guard cells undergo vigorous constitutive endocytosis and retrieve membrane including the K+-channel KAT 1 from the PM via endocytic vesicles...|$|E
