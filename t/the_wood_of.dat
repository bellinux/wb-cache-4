5|$|The {{only other}} species of Leucopholiota, L.lignicola, may be {{distinguished}} from L.decorosa by the following characteristics: free gills in L.lignicola compared with adnexed gills in L.decorosa; L.lignicola tends to grow on <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Birch, and preferably in old-growth forests; L.lignicola is restricted to boreal forest, compared to L.decorosa that grows in temperate regions; L.lignicola has a wide distribution throughout northern coniferous forests in Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> the bending part of {{the limb}} ("dustar") must endure intense {{shearing}} stress, and denser woods such as hard maples are normally used in Turkish bows. Bamboo, and wood of the mulberry family, are traditional in China. Some composite bows have nonbending tips ("siyahs"), which need to be stiff and light; they may be made of woods such as Sitka spruce.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> different trees, {{the effects}} of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. <b>The</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. <b>The</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E
5|$|Wood is pulped {{for paper}} {{and used in}} the {{manufacture}} of cardboard and made into engineered wood products for use in construction such as fibreboard, hardboard, chipboard and plywood. <b>The</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> conifers is known as softwood while that of broad-leaved trees is hardwood.|$|E
5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Hapalopilus nidulans {{causes a}} white rot in its host. Fruit {{bodies of the}} fungus grow singly, in groups, or in fused and overlapping clusters on <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> dead and decaying deciduous trees. Preferred hosts include Quercus (oak), Fagus (beech), and Betula (birch), although on rare occasions it has been recorded on conifer wood as well. In central Europe, its preferred host is oak, while in northern Europe it is found most commonly on Corylus and Sorbus. Fruiting typically occurs from early summer to autumn, but the tough fruit bodies are persistent and may be encountered out of the usual growing season.|$|E

5|$|At {{the hill}} of Puigpardines, Juigné was being already harassed by 80 armed peasants {{of the local}} somatent–a type of militia–, when the arrival of Sala's, Mas' and Baliart's miquelets {{convinced}} him to withdraw. When they tried to cross back the Fluvià, however, they found the way blocked. Juigné decided then attempting to escape to Olot across <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Malatosquera and through the bridge of Sant Roc, but the Catalans anticipated him. Sala divided his miquelets in two groups of 300 men each one, and while Josep Mas de Roda, leading the first one, pursued and attacked the French troops across the wood, he blocked the bridge of Sant Roc ahead the second group. During the running fight under the trees Juigné's force lost 25 men and abandoned part of its ammunitions.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, Cedar Point {{was in need of}} {{financial}} help. <b>The</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> the Cyclone roller coaster was rotting, the boardwalk was cracked in many places, and the fishing dock was in need of repair. In 1946, Cedar Point's oldest still-existing ride, the Midway Carousel, was installed. By 1951, the Cyclone coaster was razed because of its poor condition, leaving the resort without a roller coaster. As the Cyclone was being removed, the Laff-in-the-Dark, Rocket Ships, and Loop-A-Plane attractions were installed. Cedar Point Causeway was built in 1957, and is still in use. The president of Cedar Point, Bernie Zeiher, was replaced by George Roose around 1958, and Emile Legros was elected chairman that same year.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{deterioration}} of <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> the exterior balconies over time, Queen RanavalonaII commissioned James Cameron to reinforce and encase the original structure in a stone shell in 1867. Cameron's exterior replaced the wooden balconies with stone walls three stories high. On {{each of the three}} floors, seven arched windows run the length of the two longer side walls while five windows illuminate the shorter front and back walls. A square tower stands at each of the four corners of the stone shell, extending above the level of the walls and forming their junction. A clock and bells were installed in the north-eastern tower.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena adscendens are found {{scattered}} to grouped together in twos or threes on fallen twigs, bark, and woody debris of hardwoods {{during the spring}} and autumn; it fruits less frequently on <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> conifers. Fruitings are most common after periods of wet weather. They are also found growing on hazel nuts that have fallen to the ground; two other Mycenas known to grow on this substrate include M.discopus and M.nucicola. In the United States, it is known from Washington to California. It {{is also found in}} Europe, and has been collected in Amasya Province, Turkey. The variety carpophila, originally described from Denmark, was reported from Japan in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Galerina marginata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, obtaining nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. It {{is known to}} have most of the major classes of secreted enzymes that dissolve plant cell wall polysaccharides, and {{has been used as a}} model saprobe in recent studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Because of its variety of enzymes capable of breaking down wood and other lignocellulosic materials, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is currently sequencing its genome. The fungus is typically reported to grow on or near <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> conifers, although it has been observed to grow on hardwoods as well. Fruit bodies may grow solitarily, but more typically in groups or small clusters, and appear in the summer to autumn. Sometimes, they may grow on buried wood and thus appear to be growing on soil.|$|E
5|$|Mutualism is {{well known}} in a few beetles, such as the ambrosia beetle, which {{partners}} with fungi to digest <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> dead trees. The beetles excavate tunnels in dead trees in which they cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition. After landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery, so the weevils and the fungus both benefit. The beetles cannot eat the wood due to toxins, and uses its relationship with fungi to help overcome the defenses of its host tree in order to provide nutrition for their larvae. Chemically mediated by a bacterially produced polyunsaturated peroxide, this mutualistic relationship between the beetle and the fungus is coevolved.|$|E

5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{has been}} {{recorded}} growing on the fallen wood of oaks of the subgenus Cyclobalanopsis, as well as <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> other flowering plants. The species favours the trunks of trees, where it feeds as a saprotroph, causing white rot. P.ellipsoideus fruit bodies are perennial growers, allowing them to, in the correct circumstances, grow very large. The species {{is found in the}} tropical and subtropical areas of China; it {{has been recorded}} in Fujian Province and Hainan Province. It is not a common species, and fruit bodies are only occasionally encountered.|$|E
5|$|Plectania nannfeldtii is {{typically}} found at higher elevations in coniferous forests growing on wet twigs or other rotting woody debris, often {{in or near}} snow. It often begins its development underneath the snow, reaching maturity as the snowbank recedes to expose it; one source suggests that its metabolic heat may help it melt a path through snow as it grows. It may grow singly, scattered or in clusters, and has been noted to have a preference for <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa {{as well as other}} conifers. In North America, it is found in the Western United States and Canada, where it fruits from late May to early August; it is common in the Sierra Nevada and in higher elevations of the Pacific Coast Ranges. Its distribution also includes China and Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} more bloody fight {{took place at}} <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Malatosquera and the bridge of Sant Roc, where the French lost 500 men killed or wounded. Defeated, Juigné and his {{remaining}} troops fled to Olot, where they entrenched themselves in a convent. The Catalans forced the French to surrender by setting the building on fire. At the slight cost of 7 men killed and 5 wounded, the miquelets and peasants under Sala i Saçala killed 260 French soldiers and took 826 prisoners. Juigné was among the first. This French defeat was followed, just a month later, by the blockade by Spanish troops, miquelets and armed peasants, of the French garrisons of Castellfollit and Hostalric, which the French command decided to demolish and evacuate on July under the impossibility of keeping both positions.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> B.integrifolia is pink to red, with {{inconspicuous}} {{rings and}} conspicuous rays. It is spongy and porous, with a density of around 530 kilograms per cubic metre (33lb/ft3). It is considered highly decorative, but it warps badly on drying, has poor load-bearing qualities, and {{is susceptible to}} termite attack; it is therefore unsuitable for most construction purposes. It is sometimes used for cabinet panelling and in ornamental turnery, and natural bends were once sought after for making boat knees. It is a useful firewood.|$|E
5|$|Auricularia auricula-judae grows upon <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> {{deciduous}} {{trees and}} shrubs, favouring elder. In up to 90% of cases, the mushroom is found on elder, {{but it is}} often incorrectly assumed to grow exclusively on elder. It has also been recorded on Acer pseudoplatanus (known in the United Kingdom as sycamore), beech, ash, spindle, and in one particular case, the sycamore draining board of an old sink in Hatton Garden. Recently, A. auricula-judae has been recorded from semi-evergreen to evergreen and wet evergreen shola forests in the Western Ghats, India. This species occurs scattered and in clusters on dead or dying branches of trees, on main trunk, decaying logs, etc. This species occurs during the monsoon period in large imbricate clusters and under high humid conditions produces exceptionally large sized basidiomes. A. auricula-judae growing in wet evergreen and shola forests shows remarkable variation in size, shape and colour. In Australia, it is found in Eucalyptus woodland and rainforests; in the rainforests, it can grow in very large colonies on fallen logs. It favours older branches, where it feeds as a saprophyte (on dead wood) or a weak parasite (on living wood), and it causes white rot.|$|E
5|$|Cheddar Wood and {{the smaller}} Macall's Wood form a {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest from what remains of <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> the Bishops of Bath and Wells in the 13thcentury and of King Edmund the Magnificent's wood in the 10th. During the 19thcentury, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make strawberry fields. Most of these {{have been allowed to}} revert to woodland. The wood was coppiced until 1917. This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of calcareous grassland and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Cheddar Wood is one of only a few English stations for starved wood-sedge (Carex depauperata). Purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum), a nationally rare plant, also grows in the wood. Butterflies include silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia), dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), holly blue (Celastrina argiolus) and brown argus (Aricia agestis). The slug Arion fasciatus, which has a restricted distribution in the south of England, and the soldier beetle Cantharis fusca also occur.|$|E
