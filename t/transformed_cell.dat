40|$|Abstract c-Myc {{oncogene}} is {{an important}} regulator of cell cycle and apoptosis, and its dysregulated expression is associated with many malignancies. Myc is instrumental in directly or indirectly regulating the progression through the G 1 phase and G 1 /S transition, and transformation by Myc results in perturbed cell cycle. Also contributory to the control of G 1 is the Ras effector pathway Raf/MEK/ERK MAP kinase. Together with GSK 3, ERK {{plays an important role}} in the critical hierarchical phosphorylation of S 62 /T 58 controlling Myc protein levels. Therefore, our main aim was to examine the levels of MAPK in Myc <b>transformed</b> <b>cells</b> in light of the roles of ERK in cell cycle and control of Myc protein levels. We found that active forms of ERK were barely detectable in v-Myc (MC 29) <b>transformed</b> <b>cells.</b> Furthermore, we could only detect reduced levels of activated ERK in c-Myc <b>transformed</b> <b>cells</b> compared to the non-transformed primary chick embryo fibroblast cells.

40|$|The chicken anemia virus protein Apoptin {{selectively}} induces apoptosis in <b>transformed</b> <b>cells</b> {{while leaving}} normal cells intact. This selectivity {{is thought to}} be largely due to cell type-specific localization: Apoptin is cytoplasmic in primary cells and nuclear in <b>transformed</b> <b>cells.</b> The basis of Apoptin cell type-specific localization and activity remains to be determined. Here we show that Apoptin is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein whose localization is mediated by an N-terminal nuclear export signal (NES) and a C-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS). Both signals are required for cell type-specific localization, since Apoptin fragments containing either the NES or the NLS fail to differentially localize in <b>transformed</b> and primary <b>cells.</b> Significantly, cell type-specific localization can be conferred in trans by coexpression of the two separate fragments, which interact through an Apoptin multimerization domain. We have previously shown that Apoptin interacts with the APC 1 subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), resulting in G 2 /M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in <b>transformed</b> <b>cells.</b> We found that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity is critical for efficient APC 1 association and induction of apoptosis in <b>transformed</b> <b>cells.</b> Interestingly, both Apoptin multimerization and APC 1 interaction are mediated by domains that overlap with the NES and NLS sequences, respectively.

50|$|RhoA as well {{as several}} other members of the Rho family are {{identified}} as having roles in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and cell division. RhoA plays a pivotal role in G1 cell cycle progression, primarily through regulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p21 and p27) expression. These regulation pathways activate protein kinases, which subsequently modulate transcription factor activity. RhoA specifically suppresses p21 levels in normal and <b>transformed</b> <b>cell</b> lines via a p53-independent transcriptional mechanism while p27 levels are regulated using effector Rho-associated kinases.Cytokinesis is defined by actomyosin-based contraction. RhoA-dependent diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) localize to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis while stimulating local actin polymerization by coordinating microtubules with actin filaments {{at the site of the}} myosin contractile ring.Differences in effector binding distinguish RhoA amongst other related Ras homologs GTPases. Integrins can modulate RhoA activity depending on the extracellular matrix composition and other relevant factors. Similarly, RhoA’s stimulation of PKN2 kinase activity regulates cell-cell adhesion through apical junction formation and disassembly.Though RhoA is most notably recognized from its unique contributions in actin-myosin contractility and stress fiber formation, new research has also identified it as a key factor in the mediation of membrane ruffling, lamellae formation and membrane blebbing. A majority of this activity occurs in the leading edge of cells during migration in coordination with membrane protrusions of breast carcinoma.|$|E
5000|$|Tumours {{are formed}} by carcinogenesis, {{a process in}} which {{cellular}} alterations lead to the formation of cancer. Multistage carcinogenesis involves the sequential genetic or epigenetic changes to a cell's DNA, where each step produces a more advanced tumour. It is often broken down into three stages; initiation, promotion and progression, and several mutations may occur at each stage. Initiation is where the first genetic mutation occurs in a cell. Promotion is the clonal expansion (repeated division) of this <b>transformed</b> <b>cell</b> into a visible tumour that is usually benign. Following promotion, progression may take place where more genetic mutations are acquired in a sub-population of tumor cells. Progression changes the benign tumor into a malignant tumor. A prominent and well studied example of this phenomenon is the tubular adenoma, a common type of colon polyp which is an important precursor to colon cancer. The cells in tubular adenomas, like most tumors which frequently progress to cancer, show certain abnormalities of cell maturation and appearance collectively known as dysplasia. These cellular abnormalities are not seen in benign tumors that rarely or never turn cancerous, but are seen in other pre-cancerous tissue abnormalities which do not form discrete masses, such as pre-cancerous lesions of the uterine cervix. Some authorities prefer to refer to dysplastic tumors as [...] "pre-malignant", and reserve the term [...] "benign" [...] for tumors which rarely or never give rise to cancer.|$|E
