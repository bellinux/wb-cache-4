5|$|Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine (1635–1708) oversaw a {{substantial}} remodelling {{of the house}} in 1684, and much of the existing south facade dates from that time. The end bays were heightened, and the central porch was rebuilt with stone quoins and pilasters, a balustraded <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> small tower and cupola. A plan from 1684 shows the hall in the house's centre, with service rooms to the west and the main parlour to the east. On the first floor, the dining room was over the hall, the main bedchamber over the kitchen, and a lady's chamber over the porch.|$|E

5|$|Manchu shamans {{typically}} wore an apron, a feathered cap denoting {{their ability}} to fly to the spirit world, and a belt with dangling bells, and carried a knife, two wooden sticks with bells affixed to the <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> drum they used during ceremonies. These attributes could still be observed among shamans from Manchuria and Mongolia {{in the early twentieth}} century.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} {{was originally}} in the highway median at the Toronto terminus of the highway, {{dedicated to the}} 1939 visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and known as the Lucky Lion. The column, with a crown at the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> lion at the base, was designed by W. L. Somerville and sculptors Frances Loring and Florence Wyle for C$12,000 (in 1940, $ adjusted for inflation). The monument was removed in 1972 {{in order to accommodate}} widening of the original QEW, and relocated in August 1975 to the nearby Sir Casimir Gzowski Park along Lake Ontario, {{on the east side of}} the Humber River.|$|E
5|$|Behind the incisors and canines, {{there were}} no {{additional}} teeth in the jaw. Where teeth would be located in therocephalians that do have teeth behind the canines, there is instead a large depression, or fossa, {{on the side of}} the maxilla, which is also bounded below by part of the lacrimal and possibly part of the jugal. This fossa is 48% the length of the jaw in the type specimen, and 38% in the second skull. In both skulls, this fossa is divided into two parts: a shallower ridge on <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> larger and deeper depression on the bottom. A wide furrow beginning behind the canine contacts the bottom of the fossa and then passes into the interior of the mouth. The bottom portion of the fossa is strongly pitted and bears a small opening, or foramen, on both the front and back surfaces.|$|E

5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod {{foremast}} {{was positioned}} behind the forward funnel {{to allow the}} vertical leg {{to serve as a}} support for the boat-handling derrick. This meant that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The Bellerophons had the foremast moved forward of the funnels to reduce the problem in the spotting <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be positioned in front of the aft funnel to do that, which rendered the aft spotting top almost useless as it could be exposed to the exhaust plumes from both funnels under certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Brown enters another room {{surrounded}} by people in animal heads, and performs the third dance sequence in the video with his backup dancers. Towards {{the end of the}} chorus, Brown and his dancers appear back inside the main room and continue dancing. At one point, the video is slowed down as Brown and his dancers do flips. In other scenes, he is seen dancing alone with a cane in a rain-filled room, wearing white dress pants, a black tank <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> fedora. Brown then splits into three people, comes back together, takes off his shirt and throws it at the camera, causing its lens to crack.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was filmed under the {{direction}} of Hype Williams to promote the single. The dance sequence was choreographed by George Hubela (known as GEO) and the video takes place in a futuristic spaceship-like setting where Simpson performs an intricate dance choreography with four male and four female dancers. She wears a rainbow-colored tank <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> mini skirt in the video. At one part, the dancers perform in pairs with Simpson in front of them. Later, Simpson dances beside a male dancer while wearing sunglasses and a white top with a bedazzled American flag. In the video's final scene, Simpson, accompanied by the same dancers from the beginning, perform choreography in a red room, and dance with futuristic pole-stands. The music video also features her younger sister Ashlee Simpson as one of the background dancers.|$|E

5|$|Verena Dietzel, {{creator of}} the fashion label V-Couture, who specializes in {{different}} kinds of corsets, were enlisted to create clothing for the video, {{as well as a}} Grammy Awards performance. Dietzel explained that she had initially thought Madonna's e-mail as spam, however after confirmation from the singer's assistant stylist, B. Åkerlund, she started working on the designs. Within 48 hours she sewed a new corset, as well as created two new ones, by basing them on the only information provided to her, that of Madonna's bra-size. She had to search on Google for deducing the rest of the singer's proportions. In total four different corsets were shipped off to Madonna. Lebanese designer Shady Zeineldine was also contacted by Åkerlund, who visited the designer's press conference in Los Angeles, and asked him to send his ideas and sketches for the video. After the deal was finalized, he created a custom made matador jacket which Madonna wore in the video. Another dress was a bodysuit, featuring a nude satin-stretch corset covered in three different types of lace, a black chiffon silk <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> satin tie. There was also a red velvet bolero jacket.|$|E

25|$|To about 1620, {{the fashionable}} hat was the capotain, {{with a tall}} conical crown rounded at the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> narrow brim.

25|$|After the war the U.S. Army {{issued a}} series of kepi undress caps, characterised by their {{increasing}} smartness and decreasing practicality. The last model was issued in 1896. When the United States introduced a revised blue dress uniform in 1902, the kepi was discontinued in favour of a conventional visor cap with wide <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> steep visor.|$|E
25|$|The skirtini, which {{features}} a bikini <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> small, skirted bottom, is an innovation for bikini-style clothes with more coverage.

In 2011, The Daily Telegraph identified the skirted bikini {{as one of the top}} 10 swimwear design of the season.|$|E
