5|$|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle a spiritualist who {{supported}} the mediumship of Home stated that he was unusual in that he had four different types of mediumship: direct voice (the ability to let spirits audibly speak); trance speaker (the ability to let spirits speak through oneself); clairvoyant (ability <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>things</b> {{that are out of}} view); and physical medium (moving objects at a distance, levitation, etc., which was the type of mediumship in which he had no equal).|$|E
5|$|Carol buys a car, and the McCoys {{drive to}} an {{electronics}} store. As Doc buys a portable radio, he switches {{off the television}} set near the proprietor's desk broadcasting {{the news of the}} earlier incidents they were involved in. Suddenly, all the television sets in the store show Doc's picture, prompting him to leave immediately. The proprietor gets a glimpse of the picture, and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun, followed by several shoot-outs and police chases. The couple escape by hiding in a large trash bin, only to end up {{in the back of a}} garbage truck that dumps its load at the local landfill.

25|$|Ehrman {{examines}} the historicity of Jesus and includes some criticism of Christ mythicists. As {{he does in}} other works such as Forged and Jesus, Interrupted, he disregards an apologetics-based or otherwise religiously-charged approach to aim at looking at the New Testament using historical-critical methodology. He argues that a specific historical Jesus {{is likely to have}} really existed in the 1st century AD. Even as accounts about that figure later on brought in additional misinformation and legendary stories, Ehrman states, multiple reasons still remain <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>things</b> as framed around a flesh-and-blood actual person, at least at first.|$|E
25|$|Fixed: The fixed {{signs are}} Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius. A native with mainly fixed signs has the {{strength}} and endurance <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>things</b> through and to uphold the status quo.

A subject lacking fixed signs cannot stick with anything or see anything through, and will tend {{to walk away from}} problems. They may be too easily bored or too busy chasing rainbows ever to make anything substantial happen. Planets in the 2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th houses, or an emphasis on earth in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

500|$|The {{central issue}} in Chinese Zen {{philosophy}} of mind {{is in the}} difference between the pure and awakened mind and the defiled mind. Chinese Chan master Huangpo described the mind as without beginning and without form or limit while the defiled mind was that which was obscured by attachment to form and concepts. [...] The pure Buddha-mind is thus able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>things</b> [...] "as they truly are", as absolute and non-dual [...] "thusness" [...] (Tathatā). This non-conceptual seeing also includes the paradoxical fact that there is no difference between a defiled and a pure mind, as well as no difference between samsara and nirvana.|$|E
500|$|Descartes' {{argument}} crucially {{depends on}} the premise that what Seth believes to be [...] "clear and distinct" [...] ideas in his mind are necessarily true. Many contemporary philosophers doubt this. For example, Joseph Agassi suggests that several scientific discoveries made since the early 20th century have undermined the idea of privileged access to one's own ideas. Freud claimed that a psychologically-trained observer can understand a person's unconscious motivations better than the person himself does. Duhem has shown that a philosopher of science can know a person's methods of discovery better than that person herself does, while Malinowski has shown that an anthropologist can know a person's customs and habits better than the person whose customs and habits they are. He also asserts that modern psychological experiments that cause people <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>things</b> that are not there provide grounds for rejecting Descartes' argument, because scientists can describe a person's perceptions better than the person herself can.|$|E
500|$|Edward Bernays, {{a nephew}} of Sigmund Freud, is also {{sometimes}} referred to as the father of PR and the profession's first theorist for his work in the 1920s. He took the approach that audiences had to be carefully understood and persuaded <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>things</b> from the client's perspective. He wrote the first textbook on PR and taught the first college course at New York University in 1923. Bernays also first introduced the practice of using front groups in order to protect tobacco interests. In the 1930s he started the first vocational course in PR. Bernays was influenced by Freud's theories about the subconscious. He authored several books, including Crystallizing Public Opinion (1923), Propaganda (1928), and The Engineering of Consent (1947). He saw PR as an [...] "applied social science" [...] that uses insights from psychology, sociology, and other disciplines to scientifically manage and manipulate the thinking and behavior of an irrational and [...] "herdlike" [...] public.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the images}} connect back to his earlier works. The images of life as boat adrift with a leak {{is similar to the}} [...] "Death by Water" [...] section of The Waste Land. Like images about old age and {{experience}} found in East Coker, this image reinforces the {{need to look at the}} whole of life and try <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>things</b> beyond the limitations of time. Men are supposed to progress, but they aren't supposed to focus on what they can gain in the future. The prayer to the Virgin Mary is intended to help guide the journey which would end with understanding eternity and the Annunciation. It is Mary who will guide the metaphorical sailors to their proper harbour. While connecting back to his earlier works, Eliot also connects back to his family's past; the [...] "Dry Salvages" [...] was part of the landscape his ancestor Andrew Eliott travelled to in 1669.|$|E
500|$|Nolan's work explores existential, {{ethical and}} {{epistemological}} themes such as subjective experience, distortion of memory, human morality, {{the nature of}} time, causality and construction of personal identity. [...] "I'm fascinated by our subjective perception of reality, {{that we are all}} stuck in a very singular point of view, a singular perspective on what we all agree to be an objective reality, and movies are one {{of the ways in which}} we try <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>things</b> from the same point of view". Film critic Tom Shone described Nolan's oeuvre as [...] "epistemological thrillers whose protagonists, gripped by the desire for definitive answers, must negotiate mazy environments in which the truth is always beyond their reach." [...] In an essay titled The rational wonders of Christopher Nolan, film critic Mike D'Angelo argues that the filmmaker is a materialist dedicated to exploring the wonders of the natural world. [...] "Underlying nearly every film he's ever made, no matter how fanciful, is his conviction that the universe can be explained entirely by physical processes." ...|$|E

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, actor John Noble noted he liked how the story ultimately ended with having the two Walters [...] "perhaps negotiate a truce and put their minds together" [...] through a [...] "very inventive intervention by Peter, who basically took control of destiny and forced his two fathers to look {{each other in the}} eye, as if telling them: Sort it out, gentlemen.'" [...] He later noted, [...] "We finish [...] in a very dramatic place." [...] Joshua Jackson praised the role-reversal of his character with Walter's, [...] "You had Peter wracked with guilt over the circumstances tied to the decision he made [...] and clinging to hope that there might be some way out. I can’t have made a cosmically bad decision! There must be some way to put this right! Which is fascinating, because that’s basically been Walter for as long as we’ve known him. So I loved how Peter ceases to be so stubborn when it comes to Walter, comes to understand him and even begins <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>things</b> the way he does." ...|$|E
