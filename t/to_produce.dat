An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that it would be impossible <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> more of both goods.|$|E

The study found that total cost <b>to</b> <b>produced</b> bricks paving using using moderat production pattern is Rp. 338. 000, total cost using wavy pattern is Rp. 242. 000, and constant pattern is Rp 30. 400. Total cost <b>to</b> <b>produced</b> culverts is Rp. 900. 000 using moderat pattern, total cost using wavy pattern is Rp. 205. 000 and total cost using constant pattern is Rp. 507. 500. Total cost <b>to</b> <b>produced</b> hexagon pavingblocks using moderat production pattern is Rp. 730. 000, total cost using wavy production pattern is Rp. 450. 000, and total cost using constant pattern is Rp. 125. 000.

5|$|Although it is {{important}} in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis. This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release {{only a small amount}} of energy. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> NADH directly. As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a nitrite oxidoreductase <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH.|$|E
