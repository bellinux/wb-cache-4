All three members of what {{came to be known as}} the Brundage Commission were from the Western Hemisphere and met in New Orleans in January 1949. The commission found that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gained by recognizing the 1906 games as Olympic, and it might set an embarrassing precedent. The full IOC endorsed the report when it met later that year in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E

He told BBC Sport, [...] "I've said before, I'd much rather not score and be able to lift the UEFA Cup, than to score twice and finish up on the losing side. There's nothing to be happy about, but now we have to find a way to lift ourselves for the league game on Sunday." ...|$|E

She returned twice, and her doctor subsequently sent her for tests that confirmed the lump was cancerous, nine months after she discovered it. Continuing {{her role in the}} production Paige did not miss a show, and stated, [...] "When I did the show I became very emotional. Some of the lyrics suddenly took on an entirely different meaning. Words like, 'as if we never said goodbye' became more real". [...] Paige went in for day surgery on a Sunday due to her theatre commitments, had five years of medical treatment and completed a radiation programme. She spoke for the first time of her encounter with breast cancer in a 2004 interview, and has since described the period as [...] "the most awful thing that's happened to me in my life".|$|E
500|$|In late 1730, {{news came}} to Paraguay {{that a third}} {{replacement}} governor was on the way, Ignacio de Soroeta. [...] Rumors spread that Soroeta {{was a friend of}} the Jesuits and Reyes. [...] Mompó rallied his followers, called the comuneros, and raised a force of 300 outside the city. [...] A delegation of the comuneros sent to the cabildo demanded that the new governor be denied entry. [...] Barúa demanded that the comuneros disband; when they refused, he resigned his post in frustration. [...] The comuneros demanded new elections of the cabildo, which, unsurprisingly, they won. [...] Only those members who had accepted the rebel line were re-elected, while the other cabildo members were replaced by comuneros. [...] When Soroeta arrived, he was informed he was not wanted, and only allowed to stay in Asunción for four days under virtual house arrest. [...] Convinced <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done, Soroeta left; Barúa and Bishop Palos of Asunción also left. [...] The city was entirely under comunero control. [...] Despite the new comunero influence on the cabildo, Mompó desired an even more radical shift. [...] He apparently felt that he could not abolish the cabildo directly; instead, he created his own parallel governmental structure, [...] the Junta Gobernativa, whose members were elected by the people.|$|E

Massow subsequently described the experience as uplifting, stating that [...] "The prospect of dying wasn't frightening, as I'd thought, but calm and full of relief.

The Whirlwind helicopter had been dispatched from RAF Leuchars in Fife and the pilot attempted to fly up the line of Glen Shee but turbulence meant he had to reduce airspeed to [...] with groundspeed less than walking pace. At Pools of Dee he {{was reduced to a}} hover and was unable to ascend to the plateau so he took a wide detour to Glenmore Lodge from where the crew was asked to make an airborne check of various shelters, without any delay for refuelling.

2500|$|On 22 December, Trigger sighted a ship {{approaching}} from Uraga {{and made a}} surface attack. A spread of three torpedoes produced one hit forward of the bridge, and the target started to settle by the bow. The submarine fired one more torpedo into the ship and, when last seen, Teifuku Maru was awash forward with her screws nearly {{out of the water}}. On 31 December 1942, she attacked a cargo ship loaded with planes. Trigger fired three torpedoes from extremely close range , and watched two hit. The target began to list to starboard and was down by the bow. Sound reported a heavy secondary explosion. The submarine came up to periscope level and saw the freighter with her stern high {{out of the water and}} a destroyer approaching. Trigger went deep and when she next came up for a look, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen. (The sinking was not confirmed by JANAC postwar.) ...|$|E
2500|$|McCulloch was {{the editor}} of The Scotsman of Edinburgh; he replied cuttingly in a review printed {{on the front page}} of his {{newspaper}} in March, 1827. He implied that Malthus wanted to dictate terms and theories to other economists. McCulloch clearly felt his ox gored, and his review of Definitions is largely a bitter defence of his own Principles of Political Economy, and his counter-attack [...] "does little credit to his reputation", being largely [...] "personal derogation" [...] of Malthus. The purpose of Malthus's Definitions was terminological clarity, and Malthus discussed appropriate terms, their definitions, and their use by himself and his contemporaries. This motivation of Malthus's work was disregarded by McCulloch, who responded that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gained [...] "by carping at definitions, and quibbling about the meaning to be attached to" [...] words. Given that statement, it is not surprising that McCulloch's review failed to address the rules of chapter 1 and did not discuss the definitions of chapter 10; he also barely mentioned Malthus's critiques of other writers.|$|E
2500|$|Trigger {{stood out}} of Midway on 13 February to patrol off the Palau Islands. Two weeks later, she {{launched}} four torpedoes at a freighter, but the target managed to steer between them. Heavy air cover prevented a second attack. On 4 March, the submarine attacked a freighter in a rain squall, but all three of her torpedoes missed. On 15 March, Trigger sighted a convoy steaming in two columns. There were two freighters in the right hand column and three in the left, with an escort on the outboard bow of each column. Trigger worked her way between the two columns and launched three torpedoes {{at each of the}} leading ships. She hit the lead freighter in the left hand column twice but missed her target on the right because it unexpectedly changed course. Trigger then fired three more torpedoes at the right lead ship at just [...] and observed two hits before the escorts forced her to go deep. When she surfaced again, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen. Trigger was later officially credited with having sunk Momoha Maru, a 3,103ton cargo ship.|$|E

2500|$|On 27 November 1958, {{over the}} {{opposition}} of the Emperor, Crown Prince Akihito announced his engagement to Shōda Michikio, which {{marked the first time}} that a member of the House of Yamato had married a commoner or had married for love. For the Japanese people, the idea that a member of the Imperial family would marry a commoner for love was revolutionary as such thing had never happened in Japan before, and the marriage proved very popular with the public. In February 1959, a public opinion showed 87% of the Japanese people approved of Akihito's choice of bride. The Shinto clergy disapproved of the wedding because Michikio was a Roman Catholic while traditionalists in general led by the Emperor himself were opposed to the idea of the Crown Prince marrying a commoner for love as this was out of line with Japanese tradition, but given the level of public support, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done to stop the wedding. Kishi saw the Imperial wedding as a chance to divert attention from the unpopular security treaty, and gave his approval to the engagement. As the nation was caught in Imperial wedding fever, the so-called [...] "Mitchii" [...] crave as Michikio became the most popular woman in Japan, the issue of the security treaty vanished and Kishi mistakenly assumed the matter was over. On 10 April 1959, before a TV audience of 15 million people, Crown Prince Akihito married Michiko while half-million people showed up to watch the wedding in person. After the wedding, the matter of the security treaty returned to the public mind while Kishi thought the public had forgotten about the treaty. At the same time, right-wing terrorism which had flourished in the 1930s returned to Japan. The prospect of the children of a commoner sitting one day on the Chrysanthemum Throne energized the far-right in Japan, and left-wing opponents of the revised security treaty were threatened and sometimes assassinated. The most gory killing of the terrorist campaign of 1958-61 occurred when Inejiro Asanuma, the leader of the Socialist Party was killed while giving a speech on live television by a right-wing fanatic who stabbed him to death with his samurai sword. Kishi does seem not to ordered the killings, but he fostered a climate of opinion when anyone who criticized his government was seen as a traitor, and the police proved remarkably ineffective at stopping the far-right in their campaign of intimation and assassination against critics of the Kishi government. In 1959, Kishi visited Buenos Aires, Argentina.|$|E
