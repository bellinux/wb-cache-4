5|$|Proposals for {{building}} a planetarium in Toronto date back to 1944, but serious planning only started in 1962, thanks to a bequest made by {{a former member of}} the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC). In May 1964 the Chairman and the President of the University of Toronto gave their support for the idea to the RASC, and suggested a site near the existing Royal Ontario Museum, adding that significant financial support would have to come from outside the University <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Linnaeus {{returned}} to Sweden on 28 June 1738, {{he went to}} Falun, where he entered into an engagement to Sara Elisabeth Moræa. Three months later, he moved to Stockholm to find employment as a physician, and thus <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to support a family. Once again, Linnaeus found a patron; he became acquainted with Count Carl Gustav Tessin, who helped him get work as a physician at the Admiralty. During this time in Stockholm, Linnaeus helped found the Royal Swedish Academy of Science; {{he became the first}} Praeses in the academy by drawing of lots.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Bruce Perens {{assumed the}} project leadership. Perens was a {{controversial}} leader, regarded as authoritarian and strongly attached to Debian. He drafted a social contract and edited suggestions from a month-long discussion into the Debian Social Contract and the Debian Free Software Guidelines. After the FSF withdrew their sponsorship {{in the midst}} of the free software vs. open source debate, Perens initiated the creation of the legal umbrella organization Software in the Public Interest instead of seeking renewed involvement with the FSF. He led the conversion of the project from a.out to ELF. He created the BusyBox program <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to run a Debian installer on a single floppy, and wrote a new installer. By the time Debian 1.2 was released, the project had grown to nearly two hundred volunteers. Perens left the project in 1998.|$|E

Halacha mandates that the kohen be a distance of four amahs from a grave unless separated by a fence.

5|$|Siglinda Scarpa {{says she}} had issues with {{communication}} as a child, stating that “people were not seeing me, that they were talking, but never to me.” It was not until her father brought a stray kitten home and placed it under her sheets that Scarpa felt she could communicate with someone. The kitten was a year old when he became very ill and died. After his death, Scarpa decided to take in as many cats as possible, with the hopes of eventually creating {{a safe haven for}} cats. Scarpa created the Goathouse Refuge in 2007, naming it after an old goat who came with the dilapidated plantation house and the 16 acre property. Originally, the land was just intended for her pottery studio. After the house and studio burned down Scarpa rebuilt it with plans that included a sanctuary for cats, using personal resources and proceeds from her pottery sales <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) {{restricts the}} use of Highway 82 through the pass. Most {{significant}} is the winter closure. The road is typically closed after the first significant winter snowfall, or by November 7 at the latest (but there have been exceptions.). CDOT tries to reopen just before Memorial Day weekend in late May, the traditional beginning of summer in the United States, when enough of the accumulated snowpack has melted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to clear and repair the road. Some years, after light winters, the pass has reopened as early as May 12. Two gates, just east of Aspen on the west end and west of the remaining buildings of the stage stop of Everett on the east, prevent motor vehicles from passage. When the road is closed, Aspen is isolated from the east and Highway 82 up the valley from Glenwood Springs becomes the only vehicular access to the city during its busy ski season.|$|E

25|$|Medical imaging is the {{technique}} and {{process of creating}} visual representations of {{the interior of a}} body for clinical analysis and medical intervention, as well as visual representation of the function of some organs or tissues (physiology). Medical imaging seeks to reveal internal structures hidden by the skin and bones, as well as to diagnose and treat disease. Medical imaging also establishes a database of normal anatomy and physiology <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to identify abnormalities. Although imaging of removed organs and tissues can be performed for medical reasons, such procedures are usually considered part of pathology instead of medical imaging.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Specification and Description Language (SDL) is a do-main {{specific}} {{language that}} is well-established in the telecommunication sector since many years, but only a small set of SDL tools is available. In contrast, for the Unified Modeling Language (UML) {{a wide range of}} different kinds of tools can be used for various purposes, such as model transformation. In order <b>to</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> specify SDL compliant models with UML, a profile for the combined use of SDL and UML was standardized. This profile also embraces a textual notation for the action language of SDL-UML, which is a subset of the concrete syntax of SDL. Unfortunately, a formal specification of that textual notation is not spec-ified. In order to remedy this gap, in this paper, a model-based approach for the formalization of the textual notation for SDL-UML is presented...|$|R
