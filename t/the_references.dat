40|$|A {{reference}} frequency distribution system is disclosed for transmitting a {{reference frequency}} from a reference unit {{to a remote}} unit while keeping <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> frequency at <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> unit and <b>the</b> remote unit in phase. A fiber optic cable connects <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> unit to <b>the</b> remote unit. A frequency source at <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> unit produces a reference frequency having an adjustable phase. A fiber optic transmitter at <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> unit modulates a light beam with <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> frequency and transmits the light beam into the fiber optic cable. A 50 / 50 reflector at the remote unit reflects a first portion of the light beam from <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> unit back into the fiber optic cable to <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> unit. A first fiber optic receiver disposed at the remote unit receives a second portion of the light beam and demodulates <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> frequency to be used at the remote unit. A second fiber optic receiver disposed at <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> unit receives <b>the</b> first portion of the light beam and demodulates a reference frequency component. A phase conjugator {{is connected to the}} frequency source for comparing the phase of <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> frequency component to the phase of <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> frequency modulating <b>the</b> light beam being transmitted from <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> unit to maintain a conjugate (anti-symmetric) relationship between <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> frequency component and <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> frequency modulating <b>the</b> light beam where virtually no phase difference exists between the phase of <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> frequency component and the phase of <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> frequency modulating <b>the</b> light beam...|$|R

50|$|A table (called <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> table) {{can refer}} to a column (or a group of columns) in another table (<b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> table) by using a foreign key. <b>The</b> <b>referenced</b> column(s) in <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> table must be under a unique constraint, such as a primary key.

The Ramayana {{does not}} record any formal {{marriage}} or any ritual purification—like the trial by fire Sita had to undergo when she is reacquired by Rama from Ravana—that Tara must undertake to marry Sugriva or return to Vali following his return from the dead. The lack of the description of formal marriage suggests, according to some critics, that Tara's relationship to Sugriva is neither widow re-marriage nor polyandry, but simply appropriation by Sugriva. In <b>the</b> <b>references</b> of the coronation of Sugriva as king, Angada is also described as the heir-apparent crown prince, while Tara is mentioned as Sugriva's wife. The Adhyatma Ramayana declares that Sugriva acquires Tara.|$|E

The Norwegian subjugation of the Isles, and subsequent capture of Lǫgmaðr, are recounted by several sources. For instance, Orkneyinga saga states as much; whilst Morkinskinna further specifies that Lǫgmaðr fled southwards and out to sea, as Magnús' fleet advanced, only to be captured and kept in the Norwegian king's company for some time afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Blazing Lazers, {{known as}} Gunhed in Japan, is a shoot 'em up video game {{developed}} by Hudson Soft and Compile. It {{was released in}} Japan and North America in 1989 for the TurboGrafx-16.

In the game, a fictional galaxy is under attack by an enemy space armada called the Dark Squadron, and this galaxy's only chance for survival is the Gunhed Advanced Star Fighter, who must destroy the Dark Squadron and its Super Weapons. The gameplay features fast vertical scrolling and a wide array of weapons for the player to use.|$|E

5|$|Leonard Robinson {{argues that}} the {{popularity}} of Musidora reflects a change in art buyers.

These new buyers lacked the classical education to understand <b>the</b> <b>references</b> in history paintings, but could appreciate Musidora as a skilful execution and as a work of beauty in its own right.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} on the stronger-sacramental end of {{the spectrum}} assess the sacraments as being of great importance to the evangelist. However, perhaps counterintuitively, some scholars who find fewer sacramental references, such as Udo Schnelle, view <b>the</b> <b>references</b> that they find as highly important as well. Schnelle in particular views John's sacramentalism as a counter to Docetist anti-sacramentalism. On the other hand, though he agrees that there are anti-Docetic passages, James Dunn views the absence of a Eucharistic institution narrative as evidence for an anti-sacramentalism in John, meant to warn against a conception of eternal life as dependent on physical ritual.|$|E

5|$|The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter: A Treasury of Myths, Legends, and Fascinating Facts is a {{guide to}} the fictional Harry Potter universe, written by David Colbert. It explores <b>the</b> <b>references</b> to history, legends, and {{literature}} in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels. Colbert conceived the idea for The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter while quizzing his nephew and nieces about the mythological references in the novels. He later wrote the book while teaching a seminar on self-publishing to graduate students at the University of North Carolina. The book was published in March 2001, without approval from Rowling, and has since received positive reviews from critics. An updated version of The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter was published in 2004 by Berkley Books.|$|E
5|$|The film {{utilized}} fascist imagery throughout, including {{portraying the}} Terran Federation's personnel wearing uniforms strongly reminiscent of those {{worn by the}} SS, the Nazi paramilitary. Verhoeven stated in 1997 that the first scene of the film—an advertisement for the Mobile Infantry—was adapted shot-for-shot from a scene in Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935), specifically an outdoor rally for the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Other references to Nazism include the Albert Speer-style architecture and the propagandistic dialogue ("Violence is the supreme authority!").
