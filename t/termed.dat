40|$|AbstractWe {{review the}} concept of <b>term</b> graph {{narrowing}} as an approach for solving equations by transformations on <b>term</b> graphs. <b>Term</b> graph narrowing combines <b>term</b> graph rewriting with first-order <b>term</b> unification. This mechanism is complete for all <b>term</b> rewriting systems over which <b>term</b> graph rewriting is normalizing and confluent. This includes, in particular, all convergent <b>term</b> rewriting systems.

5|$|As {{the number}} of known {{specimens}} increased, scientists began to analyze the variation between individuals and discovered {{what appeared to be}} two distinct body types, or morphs, similar to some other theropod species.

Several morphological differences associated with the two morphs were used to analyze sexual dimorphism in Tyrannosaurus rex, with the 'robust' morph usually suggested to be female. For example, the pelvis of several 'robust' specimens seemed to be wider, perhaps to allow the passage of eggs. It was also thought that the 'robust' morphology correlated with a reduced chevron on the first tail vertebra, also ostensibly to allow eggs to pass out of the reproductive tract, as had been erroneously reported for crocodiles.|$|E
