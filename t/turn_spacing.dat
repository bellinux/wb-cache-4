40|$|Abstract – A novel {{dual-band}} planar {{helical antenna}} is proposed. The antenna {{is in the}} form of a rectangular helix, and is obtained by printing a plurality of linear metal strips on both sides of a dielectric substrate and then connecting the strips at their ends by shorting pins through via-holes in the substrate. The total length of the rectangular helix controls the antenna’s first or fundamental resonant frequency, and by adjusting the first <b>turn</b> <b>spacing</b> of the helix, the antenna’s second resonant frequency can be adjusted. A constructed prototype with its first two resonant frequencies excited at about 2. 4 and 5. 2 GHz suitable for WLAN operation is presented and studied. [Report and Opinion. 2009; 1 (2) : 78 - 79].

40|$|Q-factor {{constraints}} {{are usually}} imposed on conductor loops employed as proximity range High Frequency Radio Frequency Identification (HF-RFID) reader antennas to ensure adequate data bandwidth. However, pairing such low Q-factor loops in inductive energy transmission links restricts the link transmission performance. The contribution {{of this paper}} is to assess the improvement that is reached with a two-stage design method, concerning the transmission performance of a planar square loop relative to an initial design, without compromise to a Q-factor constraint. The first stage of the synthesis flow is analytical in approach, and determines the number and spacing of turns by which coupling between similar paired square loops can be enhanced with low deviation from the Q-factor limit presented by an initial design. The second stage applies full-wave electromagnetic simulations to determine more appropriate <b>turn</b> <b>spacing</b> and widths to match the Q-factor constraint, and achieve improved coupling relative to the initial design. Evaluating the design method in a test scenario yielded a more than 5 % increase in link transmission efficiency, as well as an improvement in the link fractional bandwidth by more than 3 %, without violating the loop Q-factor limit. These transmission performance enhancements are indicative of a potential for modifying proximity HF-RFID reader antennas for efficient inductive energy transfer and data telemetry links...|$|E
40|$|Helical antennas {{have been}} widely used as simple and {{practical}} radiators over the last few decades. The reason of this demand is that, these antennas are having remarkable and unique properties such as naturally providing circularly polarized radiation and also they have been so much popular in applications from VHF to microwaves requiring circular polarization, especially in case of satellite communications where more gain is required and that can be provided by adopting a helical antenna alone, a helical antenna can also be used as a feed for a parabolic dish for higher gains. As compared to the microstrip antenna, helical antennas are having a large bandwidth. Although gain of helical antenna is sufficient for communication purpose, but for applications like satellite communication, space communication etc., these antennas require high gain. The antenna performance is optimized by varying antennas geometrical parameters for narrowband and broadband design. So in this paper we have tried to increase the gain of helical antenna by decreasing the spacing between the turns of coil. Calculation and measurement for this new antenna have been done with the help of software MATLAB and also from HELICAL ANTENNA DESIGN CALCULATOR. In this paper by effecting the <b>turn</b> <b>spacing</b> we are able to increase the gain by 8. 75 % successfully...|$|E

40|$|In English Question+Answer (Q+A) pairs, {{periodicity}} typically emerges across <b>turn</b> <b>space,</b> to {{a degree}} of precision matching standards of music perception. Interactionally- aligned Q+A pairs display such shared periodicity across the turn, while unaligned pairs do not. Periodicity is measured as temporal location of f 0 maxima or minima, ‘pikes’, in successive accented syllables. This study asks whether periodicity of pikes across a turn is accompanied by systematic use of musical pitch intervals across the <b>turn</b> <b>space.</b> Recordings of 77 Q+A pairs from 8 pairs of native English speakers talking naturally. Ratios of f 0 in the last pike of the Question and {{the first of the}} Answer fell more reliably into Western musical interval categories when the Q+A pair’s turn transition was periodic (the Answer was aligned or preferred, re the Question) than when it was aperiodic (disaligned, dispreferred). Similar results were found for ratios of modal f 0. Such pitch ratios are better described by musical interval categories of Western tuning systems than by those of three non-Western systems, and best of all by semitones, suggesting close connections between culturally-specific uses of pitch in conversation and in music. Judgments of arousal/valence suggest weak relations with specific pitch intervals. Theoretical implications are discussed...|$|R
