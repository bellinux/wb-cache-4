40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} two models of West African {{architecture}} [...] the Mosque at Zaria, Nigeria and the Mosque at Dingueraye, Guinea. It will also attempt to illustrate implicit patterns of creative expression, both literal and allegorical, in the space-making {{processes of the}} Hausa and Fulani peoples. In passing, some attention will also {{be given to the}} cultural and building traditions of the Mande people. The notion of space and place in much of sub-Saharan Africa oscillates in a realm which is neither absolutely rational nor ethereal. Culture, it could be argued, can offer us an opportunity to investigate an analytical <b>taxonomy</b> <b>through</b> <b>which</b> we can compare and discover particular attributes of space and the phenomenological dimensions of built form. Culture, as a layered accumulation of historical events, visual vocabularies, and architectural expression, is subject {{at one time or another}} to an ethos which may have had a syncretic origin. Among the Hausa and Fulani, the image which exists within the architectural paradigm can be described as a language, or code or a method of explaining spatial concepts related to concrete space and traditional culture. The Hausa and Fulani spatial schemes are concerned with the nature of space as a context and metaphor for experience, inner and outer, hidden and manifest. by Akel I. Kahera. Thesis (M. S.)

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, Brazil has pioneered an {{innovative}} model of branchless banking, known as correspondent banking, involving distribution partnership between banks, {{several kinds of}} retailers {{and a variety of}} other participants, which have allowed an unprecedented growth in bank outreach and became a reference worldwide. However, despite the extensive number of studies recently developed focusing on Brazilian branchless banking, there exists a clear research gap in the literature. It is still necessary to identify the different business configurations involving network integration through which the branchless banking channel can be structured, as well as the way they relate to the range of bank services delivered. Given this gap, our objective is to investigate the relationship between network integration models and services delivered through the branchless banking channel. Based on twenty interviews with managers involved with the correspondent banking business and data collected on almost 300 correspondent locations, our research is developed in two steps. First, we created a qualitative <b>taxonomy</b> <b>through</b> <b>which</b> we identified three classes of network integration models. Second, we performed a cluster analysis to explain the groups of financial services that fit each model. By contextualizing correspondents' network integration processes through the lens of transaction costs economics, our results suggest that the more suited to deliver social-oriented, "pro-poor'' services the channel is, the more it is controlled by banks. This research offers contributions to managers and policy makers interested in understanding better how different correspondent banking configurations are related with specific portfolios of services. Researchers interested in the subject of branchless banking can also benefit from the taxonomy presented and the transaction costs analysis of this kind of banking channel, which has been adopted in a number of developing countries all over the world now.

40|$|Taxonomy {{is widely}} used {{in many of the}} website and {{directory}} navigation schemes for content/knowledge retrieval. However, information or content navigation support <b>through</b> <b>taxonomy</b> is often constrained due to its inability {{to take into account the}} full nomenclature and cultural nuances of knowledge seekers. The emergence and increasing adoption of collaborative tagging (social bookmarking) tools have provided lightweight and informal conceptual structures called folksonomies for knowledge retrieval. As for folksonomies, they reflect the vocabulary of the users. Hence, integrating folksonomies into a taxonomy combines the best of the two schemes as the resultant structure enhances taxonomy navigation with personsalisation for knowledge search and retrieval. This paper presents TaxoFolk, an algorithm for deriving hybrid taxonomy-folksonomy classification for enhanced knowledge navigation. The algorithm integrates folksonomy with a <b>taxonomy</b> <b>through</b> several unsupervised data mining techniques with augmented heuristics. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R

I first discuss the lack of systematic, scholarly attention to theatrical doubling in general and develop a new taxonomy of doubling, incorporating two main categories: opractical doublingo and osignificant doublingo. Practical doubling stems from economic necessity; significant doubling, consisting of six subcategories, is employed by directors and actors as a vehicle of meaning.

40|$|Knowledge {{representations}} using {{semantic web}} technologies often provide information which translates to explicit term and predicate taxonomies in relational learning. We show how {{to speed up}} the propositionalization by orders of magnitude, by exploiting such <b>taxonomies</b> <b>through</b> a novel refinement operator used in the construction of conjunctive relational features. Moreover, we accelerate the subsequent propositional search using feature generality taxonomy, determined from the initial term and predicate taxonomies and θ-subsumption between features. This enables the propositional rule learner to prevent the exploration of conjunctions containing a feature together with any of its subsumees and to specialize a rule by replacing a feature by its subsumee. We investigate our approach with a deterministic top-down propositional rule learner, and propositional rule learner based on stochastic local search...|$|R

We qualitatively evaluated {{the impact of}} the Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (Oxford BRC), a university-hospital partnership, on the effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare in local hospitals. Effectiveness and efficiency are conceptualised in terms of impacts perceived by clinicians on the quality, quantity and costs of patient care they deliver. First, we reviewed documentation from Oxford BRC and literature on the impact of research activity on patient care. Second, we interviewed leaders of the Oxford BRC's research to identify the direct and indirect impacts they expected their activity would have on local hospitals. Third, this information was used to inform interviews with senior clinicians responsible for patient care at Oxford's acute hospitals to discover what impacts they observed from research generally and from Oxford BRC's research work specifically. We compared and contrasted the results from the two sets of interviews using a qualitative approach. Finally, we identified themes emerging from the senior clinicians' responses, and compared them with an existing <b>taxonomy</b> of mechanisms <b>through</b> <b>which</b> quality of healthcare may be affected in research-active settings. We were able to interview 17 research leaders at the Oxford BRC and 19 senior clinicians at Oxford's acute hospitals.

We found the existing taxonomy of benefit types to be helpful in organising the findings, and propose modifications to further improve its usefulness. Impacts from research activity on the effectiveness and efficiency of patient care at the local acute hospitals, as perceived by senior clinicians, were more often beneficial than harmful.

The history portion {{examines the}} development of <b>taxonomy</b> <b>through</b> the works of many naturalists and biologists. One biologist in particular, Carl Linnaeus, established guidelines and the framework for nomenclature of all organisms. The present applications of taxonomy focus on the developments of taxonomy when it is integrated with evolutionary theory. This integration, named systematics, focuses on determining ancestor-descendent relationships among organisms. The present portion also examines what characteristics a taxonomist might use to determine an organism's classification. Finally the future portion of this thesis focuses on current issues that might affect taxonomy in future years. This includes taxonomy's role in species conservation, DNA taxonomy, taxonomic databases and an alternative system of nomenclature called the PhyloCode. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{advances}} of smartphone technology {{in recent years}} is leading to the uptake of a new class of Internet-based Indoor Navigation (IIN) services, which might soon diminish the need of Satellite-based technologies in urban environments. IIN services rely on geolocation databases that store indoor models comprising of floor-maps and points-of-interest along with wireless, light and magnetic signals used to local-ize users. Developing IIN services creates a new spectrum of information management challenges ranging from crowdsourcing indoor models, acquiring and fusing big-data velocity signals, localization algorithms, location privacy of custodians and others. In this work, we present the current landscape of academic and industrial IIN services using a multi-dimensional taxonomy of emerging topics in this domain, including location, crowdsourcing, privacy and modeling. We present the dimen-sions of our <b>taxonomy</b> <b>through</b> the lens of an open, modular, extensible and scalable IIN architecture, coined Anyplace, concluding with open challenges...|$|R

40|$|Relational data {{representations}} {{have become}} an increasingly important topic due to the recent proliferation of network datasets (e. g., social, biological, information networks) and a corresponding increase {{in the application of}} statistical relational learning (SRL) algorithms to these domains. In this article, we examine a range of representation issues for graph-based relational data. Since the choice of relational data representation for the nodes, links, and features can dramatically affect the capabilities of SRL algorithms, we survey approaches and opportunities for relational representation transformation designed to improve the performance of these algorithms. This leads us to introduce an intuitive taxonomy for data representation transformations in relational domains that incorporates link transformation and node transformation as symmetric representation tasks. In particular, the transformation tasks for both nodes and links include (i) predicting their existence, (ii) predicting their label or type, (iii) estimating their weight or importance, and (iv) systematically constructing their relevant features. We motivate our <b>taxonomy</b> <b>through</b> detailed examples and use it to survey and compare competing approaches for each of these tasks. We also discuss general conditions for transforming links, nodes, and features. Finally, we highlight challenges that remain to be addressed...|$|R
