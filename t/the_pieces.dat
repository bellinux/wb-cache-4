5|$|At Wollstonecraft's {{death in}} 1797, the {{manuscript}} was incomplete. Godwin published all of <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> {{of the manuscript}} in the Posthumous Works, adding several sentences and paragraphs of his own to link disjunct sections.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{requires}} a deep fryer or other device {{in which the}} chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat. The process of deep frying is basically placing food fully in oil and then cooking it {{at a very high}} temperature. <b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> are prepared as described above. The fat is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature. <b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> are added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.|$|E
5|$|Development: This is the {{technique}} of placing <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> (particularly bishops and knights) on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the game.|$|E
50|$|Capturing <b>the</b> {{checking}} <b>piece,</b> {{with either}} <b>the</b> king or another <b>piece.</b> If <b>the</b> checking <b>piece</b> is on a square {{next to the}} king, the king can capture <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> if <b>the</b> king does not move into a new check, i.e. if <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> is not protected by another enemy <b>piece.</b> Note that <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> which is pinned to the king cannot capture <b>the</b> checking <b>piece</b> because such a move will place the king in a check from <b>the</b> pinning <b>piece.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>piece</b> {{begins with}} a memorable main theme that Chopin varies {{from time to time}} in order to {{maintain}} <b>the</b> <b>piece’s</b> interest. <b>The</b> trio section of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> is very similar to the main theme, providing little contrast. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> concludes with an interesting coda, full of accidentals and chromatic harmonies and finishing on a tonic chord, repeated 4 times.|$|R

5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E
5|$|Reviews of {{the soundtrack}} album were positive, with critics praising both {{the variety of}} styles and quality of <b>the</b> <b>pieces.</b> Several critics noted Mizuta's work as {{possibly}} his finest to date. Reviewers of the game were more mixed, with some feeling {{that some of the}} styles of music did not match where they were played in the game. Critics were also mixed in their opinions of the arranged album, feeling that several of <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> were simply inferior versions of the original tracks. Both of the albums and the single sold well enough to place on the Japanese Oricon charts, with the original soundtrack album reaching a peak of #13 and remaining on the charts for eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|The new eagles entered {{circulation}} around November 4, 1907, although Leach did {{not receive}} formal approval to issue <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> until December 19.|$|E
50|$|Throughout <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>the</b> melodies develop until Gottschalk brings <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> to an {{end with}} a {{brilliant}} pair of variations, containing Stephen Foster's Camptown Races.|$|R
50|$|Rust Mirror is <b>the</b> eighth <b>piece</b> in {{a series}} of works that Rozin has created since 1999 called ‘mechanical mirrors’. In this series Rozin creates {{large-scale}} displays that recreate the viewer’s reflection by means of the manipulation of a multitude of tiles in a variety of materials, in effect turning these into physical pixels. Rust Mirror creates the viewer’s image by tilting tiles of rusted steel up and down in relation to a light source above <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> As a person interacts with <b>the</b> <b>piece,</b> a trickle of ‘rain’ starts to flow onto <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> in <b>the</b> form of sequences of moving tiles. The more the person interacts with <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>the</b> more it rains, until finally the storm of rain droplets completely overcomes the image of the viewer, accompanied by a loud rumble of rain produced by the motors and tiles. When the viewer steps out, <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> gradually settles down and returns to a still state. Rusted steel is one of the least reflective of materials, and also a material that suggests outdoor dilapidation rather than precise digital accuracy and control. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> is presented on a bed of gravel that produces a crunching sound as the viewer interacts with <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> and emphasizes <b>the</b> outdoor/architectural style that <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> implies. To interact with <b>the</b> <b>piece,</b> stand in front of it at a distance of a few meters, see yourself reflected on its surface, note that the more you move in front of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>the</b> more it ‘rains’, move closer to <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> to get a more ‘zoomed-in’ image of your reflection.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>piece</b> {{has seven}} {{different}} sections, usually {{of a different}} tempo and occasionally key. The first half of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> is in D minor, then modulates to D major, back to D minor, and then finally finishes in D major. The first section is Andante - Largo, followed by a large increase in speed to Allegro vivo. This then slows down to Molto meno. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> then slows down more to Meno, quasi lento. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> then suddenly picks up in pace and is at Allegro vivace. It then slows down to Allegretto and finally to Molto più vivo. The tempo changes make <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> exciting and interesting, but even {{with all of these}} tempo changes, it is generally expected that there should be some rubato to add feeling to <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> There are also many different dynamic changes in <b>the</b> <b>piece,</b> ranging from pianissimo to fortissimo.|$|R
5|$|This is a {{dissection}} puzzle {{similar to}} a Tangram, and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the Archimedes Palimpsest. Archimedes calculates {{the areas of the}} 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a square. Research published by Dr. Reviel Netz of Stanford University in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> could be assembled into the shape of a square. Dr. Netz calculates that <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> can be made into a square 17,152 ways. The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection have been excluded. The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in combinatorics.|$|E
5|$|After Hamilton's {{death in}} 1804, Elizabeth {{endeavored}} {{to preserve his}} legacy. She re-organized all of Alexander's letters, papers, and writings {{with the help of}} her son, John Church Hamilton, and persevered through many setbacks in getting his biography published. She was so devoted to Alexander's memory that she wore a small package around her neck containing <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> of a sonnet which Alexander wrote for her during the early days of their courtship.|$|E
5|$|Artefacts in the {{collection}} include stone sculptures, ceramics and artefacts sculpted from bone, shell, obsidian and flint. <b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> in the museum graphically depict {{the two sides of}} the power exercised by Toniná, on the one hand with sculptures of the city's rulers and on the other with its depictions of bound prisoners of war.|$|E
2500|$|For example, if [...] {{represents}} {{the position of}} a chess <b>piece</b> — [...] <b>the</b> row and [...] the column, then the joint entropy of the row of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> and <b>the</b> column of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> will be <b>the</b> entropy of the position of <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>piece</b> size {{in regular}} torrents is a {{tradeoff}} between {{the size of}} the [...]torrent file itself and <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> size. Often, for files that are 4 GB, <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> size is 2 or 4 MB, just to avoid making the [...]torrent file too big.|$|R
50|$|Pieces from xiangqi {{are usually}} {{circular}} disks, labeled or engraved with a Chinese character identifying <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> Pieces from shogi (Japanese chess) are usually wedge-shaped chips, with kanji characters identifying <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|R
5|$|Besides {{the basic}} moves of <b>the</b> <b>pieces,</b> rules also govern the {{equipment}} used, time control, conduct and ethics of players, accommodations for physically challenged players, and recording of moves using chess notation. Procedures for resolving irregularities {{that can occur}} during a game are provided as well.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{is concerned with}} evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term {{plans for the future}} play. During the evaluation, players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> on the board, control of the center and centralization, the pawn structure, king safety, and the control of key squares or groups of squares (for example, diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares).|$|E
5|$|In 1834, the United States Government {{intended}} {{to present a}} set of then-current US coins to four Asian rulers the US had either made agreements with or else hoped to treat with. Neither the silver dollar nor the eagle had been struck since 1804, {{but they were still}} considered current coins. Putting the date of striking on <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> would make them appear to be in violation of Jefferson's prohibition which remained in force. Mint Director Moore decided to strike 1804-dated dollars and eagles for the sets, and four 1804 eagles were struck. They differ from <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> struck thirty years earlier, lacking a crosslet {{on the right side of}} the crossbar of the 4. Two were presented, to the Sultan of Muscat and the King of Siam, before the diplomat in charge of the expedition, Edmund Roberts, died of disease in Macao, and his mission was abandoned. The remaining two sets were returned to the United States.|$|E
50|$|As {{the full}} title of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> denotes, <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> is scored for a solo organ, timpani {{and a string}} orchestra. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> uses such {{comparatively}} small forces, relative to Poulenc's other concertos (the Concert champêtre used a full orchestra as accompaniment), so that <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> could be played in a quite small space with an organ, such as Princess Edmond's salon, that were quite popular in France at <b>the</b> time. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> would have been premiered on a Cavaillé-Coll instrument, as the company supplied many organs to private customers, {{one of whom was}} the princess.|$|R
5000|$|Blair Johnston {{calls the}} main cadence, {{near the end}} of <b>the</b> <b>piece,</b> [...] "one of the most glorious moments in Chopin's entire output". Johnston also calls <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> [...] "one of Chopin's most graceful essays in fioritura {{ornamental}} practices". Huneker states that <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> [...] "really contains but one subject, and is a song of the sweet summer of two souls, for there is obviously meaning in the duality of voices." [...] He also claims that <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> is [...] "harmonically most interesting". Friskin states that <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> contains [...] "broken rhythms and slurs which require a delicate hand touch".|$|R
5000|$|The {{opening for}} [...] "The Grid" [...] begins with slow {{sustained}} notes on brass instruments. The music builds in speed and dynamics throughout <b>the</b> <b>piece's</b> 21 minutes. When <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> {{is at its}} fastest, it {{is characterized by a}} synthesizer playing <b>the</b> <b>piece's</b> bass line ostinato.|$|R
5|$|In 1994, {{the museum}} {{director}} Anne Hawley {{received a letter}} that promised the return of <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> for $2.6 million. If interested, the museum had to get The Boston Globe to publish a coded message in a business story. The message was published, but the writer disappeared after law enforcement got involved.|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, 20th Century Fox {{announced}} that Pitt and Norton were {{cast in the}} film. The actors prepared for their roles by taking lessons in boxing, taekwondo, grappling, and soapmaking. Pitt voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off so his character would not have perfect teeth. <b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> were restored after filming concluded.|$|E
5|$|In response, editor Cathy Kuhlmeier {{and reporters}} Leslie Smart and Leanne Tippett {{filed suit in}} January 1984 {{with the aid of}} the American Civil Liberties Union. Kuhlmeier later said that the idea for <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> had come from old issues of The Spectrum, and that she had been looking to update them.|$|E
50|$|Many American {{patriotic}} tunes, such as Yankee Doodle are quoted during <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> In <b>the</b> {{last two}} measures of <b>the</b> <b>piece,</b> <b>the</b> national anthem resolves to an unexpected, dissonant chord.|$|R
5000|$|When {{capturing}} <b>the</b> opponent's <b>piece.</b> <b>The</b> {{score is}} obtained by calculating the number value of player's <b>piece</b> which captures <b>the</b> opponent's <b>piece</b> and <b>the</b> captured <b>piece.</b> <b>The</b> mathematical operation used depends where <b>the</b> player's <b>piece</b> lands after <b>the</b> capture.|$|R
5000|$|Each of {{the eight}} {{surrounding}} squares determines <b>the</b> directions <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> can move. If a square has a stone, <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> can move in the direction indicated by the square's location relative to the central square; if a square is unoccupied, <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> cannot move in that direction.|$|R
5|$|Lombardy {{noted the}} shock that Spassky was in after he resigned:While Fischer dashed for his car, Spassky {{remained}} glued to his seat. A sympathetic Lothar Schmid came over, {{and the two}} shifted <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> about with Boris demonstrating his careless mistakes. The two were left wondering how Bobby could have squeezed a win from a position which a night of competent analysis by a renowned Soviet team had showed to be a guaranteed draw.|$|E
5|$|Major {{pieces were}} created at Crawfords Casting foundry in Enfield in Sydney's inner western suburbs. Although the foundry would {{fabricate}} {{the elements of}} the sculptures, Oliver would still undertake the initial stages, training foundry staff and supervising their activity. Some of <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> assembled to create the sculptures were made using copper rod, while others were formed using the lost-wax casting technique. Individual pieces would take up to two months to complete.|$|E
5|$|Martorana placed <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> {{of marble}} {{in a way}} that looked artistic. In 1947, a {{pedestal}} of granite taken from the Mellon Mansion was erected on the northern end of the oval. On top of it was placed a life-size bronze statue of Christ with open arms. On Armistice Day, November 11, 1951, the monument was dedicated to the defenders of the United States.|$|E
50|$|The {{theme of}} <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> is stated in {{measures}} 34-57. The orchestration includes a flexatone. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> features <b>the</b> BACH motif (B-A-C-B).|$|R
50|$|The {{workpiece}} is manually clamped to a lathe dog, {{powered by}} the faceplate, that holds <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> in between two centers and rotates <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> and <b>the</b> grinding wheel rotate in opposite directions and small bits of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> are removed as it passes along the grinding wheel. In some instances special drive centers {{may be used to}} allow the edges to be ground. The workholding method affects the production time as it changes set up times.|$|R
50|$|A player's {{promotion}} zone {{consists of}} the furthest one-third of the board - the three ranks occupied by <b>the</b> opponent's <b>pieces</b> at setup. <b>The</b> zone is typically delineated on shogi boards by two inscribed dots. When a piece is moved, if part of <b>the</b> <b>piece's</b> path lies within the promotion zone (that is, if <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> moves into, out of, or wholly within the zone; but not if it is dropped into the zone - see Drops), then the player has the option to promote <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> at <b>the</b> end of the turn. Promotion is indicated by turning <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> over after it moves, revealing the character of <b>the</b> promoted <b>piece.</b>|$|R
