2500|$|Volenti non fit injuria is Latin for [...] "to the willing, no {{injury is}} done". It {{operates}} when the claimant either expressly or implicitly consents {{to the risk}} of loss or damage. For example, if a regular spectator at an ice hockey match is injured when a player strikes the puck in the ordinary course of play, causing it to fly out of the rink and hit him or her, this is a foreseeable event and regular spectators are assumed to accept that risk of injury when buying a ticket. A slightly more limited defence may arise where the defendant has been given a warning, whether expressly to the plaintiff/claimant or by a public notice, sign or otherwise, that there is a danger of injury. The extent to which defendants can rely on notices to exclude or limit liability varies from country to country. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of policy as to whether defendants should not only warn of a known danger, but also take active steps to fence the site and take other reasonable precautions to prevent the known danger from befalling those foreseen to be at risk.|$|E

He goes on to say that the character acceleration and deceleration [...] "isn't as quick as it could be" [...] but that his biggest complaint is the way the game handles player movement between foreground, middleground and background on the 2.5D plane. He says that [...] "there are instances where it doesn't do what you want it to do, and these points stick out like a sore thumb." [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> that has been raised by Media Molecule's co-founder Mark Healey who stated in an interview that [...] "The Z [...] movement is an incredibly hard thing for us to get right.

2500|$|As {{additional}} tests are discussed for {{addition to the}} panels, issues arise. [...] Many question if the expanded testing still falls under the requirements necessary to justify the {{additional tests}}. [...] Many of the new diseases being tested for are rare and have no known treatment, {{while some of the}} diseases need not be treated until later in life. [...] This raises more issues, such as: if there is no available treatment for the disease should we test for it at all? And if we do, what do we tell the families of those with children bearing one of the untreatable diseases? Studies show that the more rare the disease is and the more diseases being tested for, the more likely the tests are to produce false-positives. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> because the newborn period is a crucial time for the parents to bond with the child, and it has been noted that ten percent of parents whose children were diagnosed with a false-positive still worried that their child was fragile and/or sickly even though they were not, potentially preventing the parent-child bond forming as it would have otherwise. As a result, some parents may begin to opt out of having their newborns screened. Many parents are also concerned about what happens with their infant's blood samples after screening. The samples were originally taken to test for preventable diseases, but with the advance in genomic sequencing technologies many samples are being kept for DNA identification and research, increasing the possibility that more children will be opted out of newborn screening from parents who see the kept samples as a form of research done on their child.|$|E
2500|$|... {{on behalf}} of some 132 cosponsors, {{introduced}} this measure. I {{would also like to}} thank Mr. Lampson from Texas as the Chairman of the Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, and Mr. Ose from the State of California, who have devoted much of their time to raising our level of awareness of the growing problem of international child abduction. [...] We are taking action on this measure {{on behalf of}} the parents of our abducted and wrongfully retained children. These left-behind parents have put their faith and trust in an international agreement, The Hague Convention, which is clear and explicit on the obligation of signatory governments to return an abducted or wrongfully retained child to his or her country of habitual residence. Nevertheless, we have found that in a number of nations, for a variety of reasons, this does not occur, and the resultant frustration, heartbreak and outrage has led us to act on the measure before us today. [...] I should also add that we need to have our State Department do more to promote compliance with The Hague Convention. The return of an abducted or illegally retained child should be on the top of the Secretary’s meetings with any official of a country involved in such cases. [...] This is not a problem that should be handled as a routine exchange of diplomatic notes or phone calls by junior U.S. officials to their foreign counterparts. We need to see some concern and some concrete actions by the highest levels of our government to redress what is, evidently, a growing international problem. [...] It is our hope that by adopting this resolution, and sending it to the floor for speedy action, we will send a strong signal that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> that we care deeply about. We need to get the attention of the Governments of Germany, Sweden, Austria, Mexico, and Honduras that they cannot expect The Hague Convention to be a one-way street.|$|E
2500|$|Senegal {{people are}} not prosecuted for their sexual {{orientation}}. Sexual orientation in Senegal is a purely private matter. It is a private matter, nothing more. For many years now, we have seen homosexuality in our country and that has never lead to situations where homosexuals are harassed, persecuted, or prosecuted. What {{has happened is that}} there have been sutiations where shocking behavior which ran counter to our religious beliefs and morality which [...] punishes unnatural sexual relations. I would ask you to understand the social realities of our country. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> which is very complex. It is a very complicated issue in Senegal. Let me say once again in Senegal homosexuals lead freely ... we even had a federal republic to authorize a homosexual to have their name changed to a woman's name in order to emphasize their feminine side. No one was shocked when the president authorized the man to adopt the woman's name. But when homosexuality becomes blatantly public, it leads to embarrassing situations. You have to understand that we are a country with a particularly tolerant form of Islam. And that is why we must avoid, we must avoid the development of fundamentalism. We must ensure social cohesion. We must also take measures to protect the lives of homosexuals. That is why I ask you to bear in mind our society, our sociological realities. This is a perfectly complicated issue for us where there are some problems but we are aware of them. ... I would like {{to go back to a}} very important issue. We are all struggling for the independence of our judges, for the independence of our justice system. If the courts hand down a decision, you cannot say the government is responsible for that court decision. The ... independent justice system which hands down a decision. And that is what the courts did in the case of the trials of these homosexuals. And I must say ... for 25 years I was a lawyer at the bar. I know the Senegalese justice system from the inside. ... Over those years there have been three cases where homosexuals were brought before the courts. The first case was an organized homosexual marriage with a lot of fuss, a lot of publicity. The police arrested them and the court case led to an acquittal. The second case of homosexuals related to a foreign national who was already rather elderly who married a young Senegalese boy. And I would like to warn you ... that if an elderly man marries a young boy, the young boy does it so that he can emigrate and go in live in France or some other country abroad, that is the interest of the young person in getting married. This led to a conviction and an appeal was made against the conviction and ... the foreigner was able to leave the country after they were acquitted on appeal. And the third case ... is the case of homosexuals who joined together again with a great deal of fuss, carried out activities which led to disturbances in the neighborhood. The neighbors complained and the police acted. This has already been tried in the first instance, and an appeal has been made against that judgment, and the justice system is now dealing with this case independently on appeal.|$|E
