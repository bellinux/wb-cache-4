5|$|Waters pitched Tipping <b>the</b> <b>Velvet</b> to ten British publishers, {{but after}} they all {{rejected}} it, she began considering American publishing houses.

By the time Tipping <b>the</b> <b>Velvet</b> was accepted by Virago Press—one of the ten that had previously passed on the project—Waters had already begun work on her second novel.|$|E

5|$|During battle, {{the player}} can {{converse}} with enemies, {{though they are}} restricted to a single set of dialogue options instead of four as in the original Persona. If the player succeeds in talking with the enemy using the right character, it both causes the enemy to leave the battlefield and gains a spell card (a Tarot card linked {{to one of the}} Arcanum or family of Personas), which can be used to create Personas in a location called <b>the</b> <b>Velvet</b> Room. In <b>the</b> <b>Velvet</b> Room, the player can summon a new Persona that belongs to a spell card's particular Persona family group. As a character gains experience levels, more powerful Personas from a spell card's group become available. In addition to pre-set spell cards, the player can also obtain blank skill cards by forming contracts with enemies through the right conversation. These blank skill cards can be tailored to fit a chosen Persona family.|$|E

5|$|Several reviewers {{compared}} Tipping <b>the</b> <b>Velvet</b> to Jeanette Winterson's Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit for {{a similar}} story of a woman's sexual awakening.

5000|$|Virgil Lewis Johnson (December 29, 1935 [...] February 24, 2013) was an African American deejay, {{formerly}} {{at radio}} station KDAV in Lubbock. He {{was the lead}} singer of <b>The</b> <b>Velvets,</b> a 1950s and 1960s vocal quintet from Odessa, also in West Texas. They are best remembered for their 1961 hit [...] "Tonight (Could Be the Night)", which peaked at No. 26 on the Billboard pop charts. The song refers to a young woman waiting {{to fall in love}} or perhaps for her intended to propose marriage and present her with a ring of commitment. <b>The</b> <b>Velvets</b> can be heard chanting [...] "doo-wop" [...] as a refrain in a song. Doo wop is considered to have originated in 1955 with The Turbans' [...] "When You Dance". However, <b>the</b> <b>Velvets</b> were a special type of doo-wop group because their sound was highly polished, and the backing usually included stringed instruments.|$|R
30|$|There {{seem to be}} {{types of}} dyes which {{specifically}} characterize <b>the</b> <b>velvets</b> of each culture, as well as types of dyes commonly found in velvets of both cultures. Dyes typical of Persian velvets are cochineal and yellow larkspur, while lac and turmeric are characteristic of Indian <b>velvets.</b> <b>The</b> dyes commonly found are a combination of yellow larkspur and indigo dye in green, as well as safflower, indigo dye, soluble redwoods, and tannin dye. There were exceptions however. Because of those exceptions, examining the range of dyes used in <b>the</b> <b>velvets</b> would be important in differentiating <b>the</b> <b>velvets.</b> Metal used for wrapping the threads was in all cases found to be silver of fairly high purity, the majority {{of which had been}} gilded. The silver from Persia metal threads showed very slightly higher copper content, while Indian threads showed nearly pure silver. This is the first extensive comparative study of dyes and metal threads of Safavid and Mughal velvets: the first evidence of yellow larkspur being the most used yellow dye in Persia, and of the possible differences in the two cultures’ metal threads.|$|R

5|$|The {{popularity}} {{of her first}} novel cast a standard for Affinity to follow, which Waters consciously made darker, set in a women's prison with a character who connects with spirits of the dead. Waters found it daunting to follow the success of Tipping <b>the</b> <b>Velvet</b> and reviewers marked {{the differences in the}} main characters: where Nan adventurously seeks out and states her desires, Margaret in Affinity is compelled by desire, but internally struggles with it.|$|E
