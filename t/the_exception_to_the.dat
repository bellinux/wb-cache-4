5|$|The Code sought {{not only}} to {{determine}} what could be portrayed on screen, but also to promote traditional values. Sexual relations outside of marriage could not be portrayed as attractive and beautiful, presented {{in a way that}} might arouse passion, nor be made to seem right and permissible. All criminal action had to be punished, and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience. Authority figures had to be treated respectfully, and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains. Under some circumstances, politicians, police officers and judges could be villains, {{as long as it was}} clear that they were <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rule.|$|E

25|$|There was no fixed {{process for}} papal {{selection}} before 1059. Popes, {{the bishops of}} Rome {{and the leaders of}} the Catholic Church, were often appointed by their predecessors or secular rulers. While the process was often characterized by some capacity of election, an election with the meaningful participation of the laity was <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rule, especially as the popes' claims to temporal power solidified into the Papal States. The practice of papal appointment during this period would later give rise to the jus exclusivae, a veto right exercised by Catholic monarchies into the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|On 7 June 2017, the IBF granted Joshua an {{exception}} for him to rematch Klitschko instead of fighting mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev. At this point, it was not said that the rematch would take place. Klitschko said he needed time to review his situation before agreeing to a rematch. It was only weeks after the fight, when Eddie Hearn filed the paperwork to the IBF to request <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mandatory defense. IBF explained that the rematch must take place no later than 2 December 2017 and the winner must fight Pulev next with no exceptions.|$|E

25|$|Also {{writing in}} 1971, Hugh M. Richmond offered {{an entirely new}} view of the play's love story lines. He argued that what passes for love in this play is {{actually}} a self-destructive expression of passion. He argued that the play's significant characters are all affected by passion and by a sadomasochistic type of sexuality. This passion prevents the lovers from genuinely communicating with each other. At {{the same time it}} protects them from the disenchantment with the love interest that communication inevitably brings. <b>The</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rule is Bottom, who is chiefly devoted to himself. His own egotism protects him from feeling passion for anyone else. Richmond also noted that there are parallels between the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe, featured in this play, and that of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.|$|E
25|$|The law {{provides}} {{for the right to}} bail, except in cases involving narcotics, violent crimes, and firearms violations. Although the bail system was used, civil rights groups claimed that judges were more likely to order the holding of indicted suspects in preventive or pretrial detention than to allow suspects to remain free pending their trial. In November 2008 the highest penal court broadly ruled that pretrial detention should be <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rule, except in cases where a suspect represents a flight risk or may act to obstruct justice. Detainees are allowed prompt access to counsel, and public defenders were provided for detainees unable to afford counsel, although such access sometimes was delayed due to an overburdened system. Strong demand and a lack of resources for the Public Defender's Office results in an excessive caseload for public defense attorneys.|$|E
25|$|He {{attended}} the official university lectures, but complained that most were stupid and boring, {{and found himself}} too sensitive {{to the sight of}} blood. He was disgusted by the dull and outdated anatomy lectures of professor Alexander Monro tertius, and later regretted his failure to persevere and learn dissection. Munro's lectures included vehement opposition to George Combe's daringly materialist ideas of phrenology. As <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> general dullness, the spectacular chemistry lectures of Thomas Charles Hope were greatly enjoyed by the brothers, but they did not join a student society giving hands-on experience. Darwin regularly attended clinical wards in the hospital despite his great distress about some of the cases, but could only bear to attend surgical operations twice, rushing away before they were completed due to his distress at the brutality of surgery before anaesthetics. He was long haunted by the memory, particularly of an operation on a child.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The paper {{examines}} {{case law}} and statutory provisions related <b>to</b> lifting <b>the</b> corporate veil. The aim of <b>the</b> paper is <b>to</b> explore recent case law {{in order to}} determine whether courts have moved away from an overly restrictive approach when dealing with cases relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corporate personality. <b>To</b> offer a full account of <b>the</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corporate personality doctrine, this paper also examines cases where the veil of incorporation is lifted due to a breach of a statutory provision. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews recent case law and statutory provisions relating <b>to</b> lifting <b>the</b> corporate veil. The paper critically reviews <b>the</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corporate personality doctrine which amount <b>to</b> lifting <b>the</b> corporate veil. Findings – The paper finds that courts are more willing <b>to</b> lift <b>the</b> corporate veil compared to before. They have moved away from the restrictive approach and this is demonstrated by <b>the</b> tendency <b>to</b> find new <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corporate personality doctrine such as the interests of justice argument or lifting the veil in tort cases. Originality/value – The paper offers an up-to-date assessment of <b>the</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corporate personality doctrine and highlights <b>the</b> growing tendency <b>to</b> finding new ways of lifting the corporate veil...|$|R

25|$|The Tennessee Constitution {{requires}} each {{county to}} elect a sheriff to a four-year term. In all Tennessee counties except one, the sheriff is an official with full police powers, usually county-wide, although Tennessee sheriffs and their deputies generally perform the patrol portion of their duties primarily in unincorporated areas of their counties if the municipalities have their own police departments. <b>The</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rule is Davidson County. In Davidson County, the sheriff has the primary responsibility of serving civil process and jail functions without the common law powers to keep the peace. Protection of the peace is instead {{the responsibility of the}} Metropolitan Nashville Police Department under the county's Metropolitan Charter. The Metropolitan Charter did not remove the Davidson County Sheriff's status as a Law Enforcement officer however. It is simply not his or her primary function as it was prior to the consolidation of the City of Nashville and Davidson County.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} state (solid, liquid, or gas) of a reactant {{is also an}} important factor of the rate of change. When reactants are in the same phase, as in aqueous solution, thermal motion brings them into contact. However, when they are in different phases, the reaction is limited to the interface between the reactants. Reaction can occur only at their area of contact; {{in the case of a}} liquid and a gas, at the surface of the liquid. Vigorous shaking and stirring may be needed to bring the reaction to completion. This means that the more finely divided a solid or liquid reactant the greater its surface area per unit volume and the more contact it with the other reactant, thus the faster the reaction. To make an analogy, for example, when one starts a fire, one uses wood chips and small branches — one does not start with large logs right away. In organic chemistry, on water reactions are <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rule that homogeneous reactions take place faster than heterogeneous reactions.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{contemporary}} critical {{opinion was}} largely positive. Bob Martin, editor of Fangoria, reviewed the film before its formal premiere and proclaimed that it [...] "might be <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> usual run of low-budget horror films". The Los Angeles Times called the film an [...] "instant classic", proclaiming it as [...] "probably the grisliest well-made movie ever."

500|$|A {{cardinal}}-nephew ( [...] ; [...] ) is {{a cardinal}} elevated by a pope {{who is that}} cardinal's uncle, or, more generally, his relative. The practice of creating cardinal-nephews originated in the Middle Ages, and reached its apex during the 16th and 17th centuries. The word nepotism originally referred specifically to this practice, when it appeared in the English language about 1669. From {{the middle of the}} Avignon Papacy (1309–1377) until Pope Innocent XII's anti-nepotism bull (a papal charter), Romanum decet pontificem (1692), a pope without a cardinal-nephew was <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rule. Every Renaissance pope who created cardinals appointed a relative to the College of Cardinals, and the nephew was the most common choice, although one of Alexander VI's creations was his own son.|$|E

HipHopDX listed the track as one of [...] "the classics that created" [...] the album's hype, and Pitchfork Media stated it was [...] "chock-full-of-clever". Vibe magazine wrote that [...] "West's sideways approach to music making stands out" [...] on the track and the [...] "raw, teeth-clenching narrative falls in line with his gutwrenching soul beats."

500|$|Gould also {{discusses}} {{the possibility that}} what Morrell sighted was [...] the eastern coast of Graham Land, the so-called [...] "Foyn Coast", despite its being 14° further west from position of the New South Greenland sighting. [...] Gould asserts that {{the features of the}} peninsula's eastern coast corresponds [...] closely with [...] Morrell's description of Nw South Greenland. This theory supposes that Morrell miscalculated the ship's position, perhaps because he lacked the chronometer necessary for proper navigational observation. In his account Morrell writes that he was [...] "destitute of the various nautical and mathematical instruments", although other parts of his narrative seem to indicate that the occasional dead reckoning calculation was <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> norm. A longitudinal error of 14° is very large, and the additional distance of about [...] to the Foyn coast seems too great to have been covered within the ten-day voyage from the South Sandwich Islands, where the ship's position is recorded accurately. Even so, Gould suggests that a [...] "balance of evidence" [...] shows that what Morrell saw was the Foyn coast.|$|E

500|$|James {{continued}} {{to ask that}} she and her family be given the ordinance of adoption so that they could be sealed together forever. Her justification for asking to be <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church's rule was Emma Smith's offer in 1844 to have her sealed to the Smith family as a child. James was now reconsidering her decision, and asked to be sealed to the Smiths. Her requests were again refused. Instead, the First Presidency [...] "decided she might be adopted into the family of Joseph Smith as a servant, which was done, a special ceremony having been prepared for the purpose." [...] The ceremony took place on May 18, 1894, with Joseph F. Smith acting as proxy for Joseph Smith, and Bathsheba W. Smith acting as proxy for James (who was not allowed into the temple for the ordinance). In the ceremony, James was [...] "attached as a Servitor for eternity to the prophet Joseph Smith and in this capacity be connected with his family and be obedient to him in all things in the Lord as a faithful Servitor".|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court {{decision}} in United States v. U.S. District Court (1972) left {{open the possibility}} for a foreign intelligence surveillance exception to the warrant clause. Three United States Courts of Appeals have recognized a foreign intelligence surveillance exception to the warrant clause, but tied it to certain requirements. <b>The</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fourth Amendment was formally recognized by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review in its 2008 [...] decision. The lower court held that, [...] "a foreign intelligence exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement exists when surveillance is conducted to obtain foreign intelligence for national security purposes and is directed against foreign powers or agents of foreign powers reasonably believed to be located outside the United States." [...] Despite the foregoing citation the Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures nonetheless apply to the contents of all communications, whatever the means, because, [...] "a person's private communications are akin to personal papers." [...] To protect the telecommunication carriers cooperating with the US government from legal action, the Congress passed a bill updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to permit this type of surveillance.|$|E
500|$|... "I Miss You" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. Heather Phares of Allmusic complimented [...] "I Miss You", and categorized {{it as one}} of the tracks on Meet Miley Cyrus that bared much resemblance to Hannah Montana songs. Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote that [...] "I Miss You" [...] is [...] "as doleful as it gets". Andy Spletzer of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer believed the track had a level a sincerity that was void from the remainder of Cyrus' repertoire at the time. He added, [...] "The songs are more guitar-driven, the outfits more adult, and the lyrics imply a string of bad boyfriends -- but it feels like imaginary drama taken from high school poetry, as if she's pretending to be older than she is." [...] In a similar note, Elysa Gardner of USA Today stated the song was <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] "heavy on flash and fantasy" [...] that characterized Cyrus at the time. Joseph P. Kahn of the Boston Globe mentioned the song while remarking that Cyrus' songs surpass much of the music played on Radio Disney. Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide believed the track was a clear demonstration of how affectionate Cyrus was with her grandfather. Kelly Jane Torrance of The Washington Times said [...] "I Miss You" [...] was an unpredictable effort, which, according to her, was both empathetic and executed properly, from Cyrus.|$|E
