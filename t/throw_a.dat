5|$|Bart and his sister, Lisa, {{enter the}} empty ring {{and decide to}} settle their lifelong feud then and there. As they {{approach}} each other to <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> punch, the credits begin, but the scene immediately returns to depict Lisa easily punching Bart to the ground.|$|E
5|$|He was {{the first}} {{starting}} pitcher to <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> complete game without giving up an earned run against the Yankees in Game1 of a postseason series.|$|E
5|$|After Ellis {{defeated}} the Reds by {{a score of}} 1-0 in a 1973 game, Joe Morgan claimed that Ellis threw a spitball. Anderson had the umpire check Ellis, but found no evidence. In his 1980 book, Ellis admitted that wearing hair curlers produced sweat on his hair, which he used to <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> modified version of a spitball.|$|E
5000|$|Martin {{is listed}} at 6 ft and [...] He <b>throws</b> <b>a</b> fastball that averages 95 mph. He also <b>throws</b> <b>a</b> slider and a cut fastball.|$|R
50|$|Cassidy {{primarily}} <b>throws</b> <b>an</b> 88-90 MPH fastball, and an 78-81 MPH slider. He <b>throws</b> <b>an</b> occasional changeup around 80 MPH, and a curveball around 77 MPH.|$|R

5|$|Capturing Pokémon {{is another}} {{essential}} element of the gameplay. During a battle with a wild Pokémon, the player may <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> Poké Ball at it. If the Pokémon is successfully caught, it will come under the ownership of the player. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon {{and the type of}} Poké Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{proposes to}} Cooder, {{that if he}} can <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> hula hoop onto the chimney, they get their house back. If he misses, he will sign the deed over to Cooder. Cooder agrees and steps onto the lawn to watch Homer's attempt. Homer {{stretches}} and warms up, as if about to throw, but instead {{he and his family}} suddenly rush into the house, leaving Cooder and Spud dumbfounded.|$|E
5|$|Humber {{became the}} seventh {{former member of}} the Mets to go on to <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> no-hitter for another team. The other six are Nolan Ryan, Tom Seaver, Mike Scott, Dwight Gooden, Hideo Nomo and David Cone. The New York Mets, at the time of Humber's perfect game, had never had a no-hitter thrown by a player in the 50-year history of the {{franchise}} (Johan Santana has since accomplished this feat).|$|E
50|$|Van Mil <b>throws</b> <b>a</b> fastball that averages 95 mph, {{which has}} been {{recorded}} as fast as 99 mph. Van Mil also <b>throws</b> <b>a</b> slider and a change-up.|$|R
5000|$|Alternately, [...] could <b>throw</b> <b>an</b> {{exception}} (but {{depending on}} the language, this may also require that the original author of [...] declare that it may <b>throw</b> <b>an</b> exception).|$|R
60|$|And {{then as the}} Glaring-at-Gotham car {{rolled away}} she turned and <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> kiss--his wife <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> kiss--at some one {{high up on the}} seats of the Rubberneck.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Kenneth is {{planning}} a party. Knowing this, Liz recounts past parties of Kenneth's to Tracy, telling {{him that she was}} the only other person who attended those parties. Feeling pity for Kenneth, Tracy tells the biggest gossips on TGS with Tracy Jordan, Grizz and Dot Com (Grizz Chapman and Kevin Brown), that T.I. will be attending. They persuade other people to attend by telling various other lies. The resulting party is so outrageous that Kenneth decides never to <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> party again.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{returns from}} his Jamaican {{vacation}} rejuvenated, and directs the Party Planning Committee to <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> luau-themed {{party in the}} warehouse to accompany the annual inventory. When Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) notices Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) {{in the margins of}} a photo from Michael's vacation, he admits to the documentary crew that he and Jan went to Jamaica together.|$|E
5|$|Pennock {{made his}} major league debut with the Athletics during the 1912 season on May 14, {{allowing}} one hit in four innings pitched. He {{was the youngest}} person {{to play in the}} American League (AL) that season. Former major leaguer Mike Grady, a neighbor of Pennock's in Kennett Square, took Pennock under his wing, while Bender taught Pennock to <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> screwball.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though the}} Padres never had <b>a</b> pitcher who <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> perfect game, Mat Latos <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> one hitter in a 1-0 {{win over the}} Giants on May 13.|$|R
5000|$|September 18, 1951: Allie Reynolds <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> no-hitter {{to clinch}} the American League pennant. It {{was the first}} time that <b>a</b> pitcher <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> no-hitter to clinch a pennant.|$|R

5|$|The Mets added deGrom {{to their}} 40-man roster on November 20, 2013, {{to protect him}} from being {{eligible}} in the Rule 5 draft. During the offseason, deGrom improved his mechanics, and learned to <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> curveball. He began the 2014 season with Las Vegas, and had a 4–0 win–loss record and a 2.58 ERA in his first seven games started.|$|E
5|$|The {{incendiary}} liquids of {{the ancient}} and medieval periods were also developed, and have their modern equivalents. World War I saw {{the development of the}} flamethrower, a modern version of the Byzantine siphons, which used gas under pressure to squirt a mixture of inflammable oil and petrol, ignited by a burning taper. Similarly, the carcass projectile found new use in the Livens Projector, a primitive mortar that could <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> large canister of inflammable liquid (it was soon used for poison gas instead).|$|E
5|$|A year later, David Cone, {{one of the}} {{key players}} in the then-most recent Yankee dynasty, started for the Red Sox against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium to the sound of a {{standing}} ovation despite playing for the arch-rival Red Sox. It marked Cone's first return to Yankee Stadium since leaving the team. Cone would later take part in another notable game later that year when he went up against newly acquired Yankee pitcher Mike Mussina. Mussina had come within one strike of pitching a perfect game against the Red Sox at Fenway Park. Carl Everett's 9th-inning two-out, two-strike single was the only baserunner allowed by Mussina in a 1–0 Yankee win. Coincidentally, David Cone was the last Yankee pitcher to <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> perfect game, in 1999.|$|E
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Rohan Davey <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> 3-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Tommy Banks, as LSU got within 14-9.

50|$|Some of Bradstock's {{throwing}} feats include: <b>Throwing</b> <b>a</b> vinyl records 112.10 meters, a {{golf ball}} 170 yards, a cell phone 132 yards, a soccer ball 82 yards and <b>throwing</b> <b>an</b> iPod classic 154 yards.|$|R
5|$|According to {{the later}} Chronicle of Polish Dukes by Gallus, the battle {{occurred}} by accident: When Bolesław decided to <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> feast to boost his army's morale, Yaroslav's archers and scouts {{decided to create}} trouble for the Polish servants who were gutting the animals and preparing them near the river. However, they only annoyed them enough that the servants themselves crossed the relatively shallow river and chased away Yaroslav's surprised troops, who had been guarding the river. Bolesław learned of the skirmish sooner than Yaroslav, and managed to move most of his army across the river, defeating the surprised Yaroslav.|$|E
5|$|After the Ice King captures Princess Bubblegum, Finn and Jake {{manage to}} save her. Bubblegum is {{so happy that}} she decides to <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> party for Finn as a thank you. Finn makes a Paper Crane for Bubblegum as a gift, but Jake says that Finn has a crush on her, which Finn denies. When they arrive at the party, however, no one notices them; everyone, {{including}} Bubblegum, is too preoccupied with a heart-shaped man named Ricardio. He and Bubblegum begin discussing scientific topics on the dance floor, which leaves Finn feeling jealous.|$|E
5|$|Before 1920 if {{one player}} {{approached}} another player to <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> contest, {{there was a}} very good chance he would not be informed upon. Now, there was an excellent chance he would be turned in. No honest player wanted to meet the same fate as Buck Weaver... Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E
50|$|The Redskins {{responded with}} a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Graham Gano. The Patriots added to their lead, with quarterback Tom Brady <b>throwing</b> <b>an</b> 11-yard {{touchdown}} pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski. The Redskins countered, with Grossman <b>throwing</b> <b>a</b> 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jabar Gaffney, then grabbed the lead {{early in the second}} quarter, with wide receiver Brandon Banks <b>throwing</b> <b>a</b> 49-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Santana Moss.|$|R
50|$|There {{were many}} {{competitions}} for <b>throwing</b> <b>a</b> cricket ball the furthest distance, {{particularly in the}} earlier years of the game. Wisden describes how the record was set around 1882, by one Robert Percival at Durham Sands Racecourse, at 140 yards and two feet. Former Essex allrounder Ian Pont <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> ball 138 yards in Cape Town in 1981. There are unconfirmed reports that Jānis Lūsis, once <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> ball 150 yards.|$|R
50|$|Peter Jackson {{gave himself}} a cameo {{appearance}} {{as one of}} the Rohirrim; he <b>throws</b> <b>a</b> javelin at the Uruks. Producer Barrie Osborne has a similar cameo, as <b>a</b> Rohirrim <b>throwing</b> <b>a</b> rock down on them.|$|R
5|$|Bret Hart was {{scheduled}} to defend his title against Bob Backlund at Survivor Series 1994. The stipulations stated {{that the only way}} to win was to force the person in your opponent's corner to <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> towel into the ring. Davey Boy Smith was in Bret's corner, while Owen Hart was in Backlund's corner. Smith chased Owen around the ring until Smith suffered a kayfabe injury, leaving nobody to throw in Bret's towel. As Backlund performed the crossface chickenwing on Bret, Owen pretended to show remorse. He convinced his mother, Helen, to throw in Bret's towel. After Backlund was awarded the belt, Owen celebrated his success in costing Bret the title.|$|E
5|$|Catching Pokémon {{is another}} {{essential}} element of the gameplay. While battling with a wild Pokémon, the player may <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> Poké Ball at it.

Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon {{and the type of}} Poké Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture. The ultimate goal of the games is to complete the entries in the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 151 creatures.|$|E
5|$|Cueto walked Murphy {{with two}} outs in the ninth before getting Cespedes to fly out to right to finish the {{complete}} game, becoming the first AL pitcher to accomplish this feat in the World Series since Jack Morris in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series, as the Royals defeated the Mets and took a two games to zero lead in the series. Cueto became the first AL pitcher since Jim Lonborg in the 1967 World Series to <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> World Series complete game while allowing two hits or fewer.|$|E
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Charlie Whitehurst <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> 10-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Ben Hall to make it 34-9. B.J. Symons <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> 2-yard {{touchdown pass to}} Carlos Francis to make it 41 - 9, Texas Tech.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>throwing</b> axe is <b>a</b> weapon {{used during}} the Middle Ages by foot {{soldiers}} and knights occasionally. Usually, they are <b>thrown</b> in <b>an</b> overhand motion (much like <b>throwing</b> <b>a</b> baseball) {{in a manner that}} causes the axe to rotate as it travels through the air.|$|R
50|$|Lidle <b>threw</b> <b>an</b> 88-90 mph fastball with cut and sink. He <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> low-70s curveball to keep hitters off balance, and a low-80s slider. He was a finesse {{pitcher who}} {{had to rely on}} {{changing}} speeds and pinpoint location.|$|R
