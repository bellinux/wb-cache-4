They also face the common problem that, as yet, {{there is no}} way to put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests (and thus to decide between the candidates where their predictions vary), although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>hope</b> for this to change as future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments becomes available.|$|E
5|$|The album's lyrics {{have been}} {{described}} as an anthematic examination of the struggles of the American working class and politically liberal. Along with highlighting the struggles of blue-collar America, the lyrics portray the idea that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>hope</b> even when things appear to be bleak and that giving up is not an option. While there are Christian themes throughout the songs, neither Christian nor secular reviewers found them to be preachy.|$|E

25|$|Critics of MINUSTAH's goal of {{providing}} security {{say that the}} provision of increased police presence is coming with the unfortunate consequence of neglecting the vast socioeconomic problems in the area, the lack of effort in addressing infrastructure improvement, the joblessness and the pervasive poverty. In 2009, with the appointment of former U.S. President Bill Clinton as the UN Special Envoy, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>hope</b> that the international donor community will provide increased aid. MINUSTAH renewed its commitment to Haiti, and $3 billion for projects has been pledged by the international community, much of this for rebuilding after the hurricanes. However, in Cité Soleil, {{there are signs of}} a desire for political independence that the international community would rather ignore.|$|E

Two weeks after {{escaping}} Heavenly Host, Ayumi and Naomi go to investigate the Shinozaki estate, Sachiko's birthplace, believing <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>hope</b> in reviving their dead friends since Naho and Kou Kibiki's existences were not erased like the other victims. At the estate, Ayumi discovers that she is of the same lineage as Sachiko. Hearing an eerie voice, Ayumi uncovers a magical tome known as the Book of Shadows. Ayumi and Naomi perform a resurrection spell for Mayu, but fail. As compensation for using black magic, the book unleashes its rage upon Ayumi until her older sister Hinoe Shinozaki rushes in and saves Ayumi, {{at the cost of}} her own life.|$|E

He said his stepdaughter had developed a significant emotional bond with Garrido, and the two daughters cried when they learned of their father's arrest. Dugard's aunt, Tina Dugard, said Dugard's daughters are clever, articulate, curious girls who have a bright future ahead of them. Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said Dugard's reappearance is an important event for families of other long-term missing children, because it shows that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>hope</b> even in long-term cases. Notable abduction survivor Elizabeth Smart has {{stressed the importance of}} focusing on the future with a positive attitude as an effective approach to accepting what has happened. Shawn Hornbeck, another abduction survivor, also commented on the case, noting: [...] "Coming out of what she's had to endure is like entering a new world. It's like a door has opened for her and she's emerged from a world that's black and white into one that's full of color."
