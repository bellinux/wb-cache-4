25|$|The {{military}} cannot {{continue to}} be an organization with unmatched institutional reach and political influence, while limiting state capacity, because in doing {{so it will be}} evermore challenging for civilian supremacy to take a stance, thus establishing effective civil-military relations. If these problems are not addressed properly, as long as civil-military relations of countries continue to interact within undefined boundaries, without clear subordination and authority and with the constrictions of limited budgets, it is unlikely that countries that still struggle with the concept will achieve a stable and efficient civil-military relationship, something <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> damage state capacity and stability.|$|E
25|$|As stated earlier, the CO2 {{released}} by soil respiration is a greenhouse gas <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> trap energy {{and increase the}} global mean temperature if concentrations continue to rise. As global temperature rises, so will the rate of soil respiration across the globe thereby leading to a higher concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, again leading to higher global temperatures. This {{is an example of}} a positive feedback loop. It is estimated that a rise in temperature by 2 degrees Celsius will lead to an additional release of 10 Pg carbon per year to the atmosphere from soil respiration. This is a larger amount than current anthropogenic carbon emissions. There also exists a possibility that this increase in temperature will release carbon stored in permanently frozen soils, which are now melting. Climate models have suggested that this positive feedback between soil respiration and temperature will lead to a decrease in soil stored carbon by the middle of this century.|$|E
