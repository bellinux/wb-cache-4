5|$|The {{psychoanalyst}} Richard Sterba {{wrote in}} 1982 that Reich {{had been a}} brilliant clinician and <b>teacher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s; even the older analysts had wanted to attend his technical seminars in Vienna.

50|$|The {{regression}} {{result can}} be interpreted as: The mean salary of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West (base group) is about $26,158, the salary of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North is lower by about $1734 ($26,158.62 − $1734.473 = $24.424.14, which is the average salary of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North) and that of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South is lower by about $3265 ($26,158.62 − $3264.615 = $22,894, which is the average salary of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South).|$|R

50|$|The {{expected}} values can {{be interpreted}} as follows: The mean salary of public school <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West is equal to the intercept term α1 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> multiple regression equation and the differential intercept coefficients, α2 and α3, explain by how much the mean salaries of <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North and South Regions vary from that of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West. Thus, the mean salaries of <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North and South is compared against the mean salary of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West. Hence, the West Region becomes the base group or the benchmark group,i.e., the group against which the comparisons are made. The omitted category, i.e., the category to which no dummy is assigned, is taken as the base group category.|$|R

The estimated slope coefficient for the North is not statistically significant as its p value is 23 percent; however, that of the South is statistically significant at the 5% level as its p value is only around 3.5 percent. Thus the overall result is that the mean salaries of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West and North are not statistically different from each other, but the mean salary of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South is statistically lower than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West by around $3265.

5|$|These {{effects were}} not felt uniformly, however. For example, {{by the end}} of the Brezhnev era, blue-collar workers had higher wages than {{professional}} workers in the Soviet Union. For example, the wage of a secondary school <b>teacher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union was only 150 rubles while a bus driver's wage was 230. As a whole, real wages increased from 96.5 rubles a month in 1965 to 190.1 rubles a month in 1985. A small minority benefited even more substantially. The state provided daily recreation and annual holidays for hard-working citizens. Soviet trade unions rewarded hard-working members and their families with beach vacations in Crimea and Georgia. Workers who fulfilled the monthly production quota set by the Soviet government were honored by placing their respective names on the factory's Roll of Honor. The state awarded badges for all manner of public services, and war veterans were allowed to go to the head of the shop queues. All members of the USSR Academy of Sciences were given a special badge and their own chauffeur-driven car. These awards, perks and privileges made it easier for some to find decent job placements, though they did not prevent the degeneration of Soviet society. Urbanization had led to unemployment in the Soviet agricultural sector, with most of the able workforce leaving villages for the local towns.|$|E

Serah is aided by Noel Kreiss, who tells her of Lightning's fate and his own mission. After Serah accepts Noel's offer to be brought to Lightning, the two embark on a journey across time to find her sister. In the process, Serah encounters Caius Ballad, while learning from Paddra Nsu-Yeul that she possesses the same detrimental ability as her to see the future. Despite learning that she would die herself if she continues seeing visions of the future, Serah resolves to change the future for everyone's sake. However, after Caius's defeat and returning to Gran Pulse five hundred years in her future, Serah has another vision and dies moments before Gran Pulse is infected by Valhalla's chaos. Serah appears to Lightning in Valhalla as a spirit, telling her she knew that she could have died from her visions but still took the risk regardless. Serah promises Lightning that they will see each other again as long as Lightning promises to remember her. In Lightning Returns, Serah's soul, which has been kept safe within Lightning, is removed and cast away by Bhunivelze. Lumina acts as a shelter for Serah's soul, resulting in the two being similar in appearance. Bhunivelze also creates a false version of Serah to keep Lightning in line. This false Serah, who develops feelings for her 'sister' arrives when Lightning intends to become the protector of the new world and persuades her to accept her vulnerabilities and call for aid. The real Serah reunites with Lightning and her allies, and travels with them to the new world.|$|E
