2500|$|Although {{some of the}} {{population}} of male gamers have been the source of harassment towards female gamers and over-sexualization of the characters, there are many men in the gaming industry who agree that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> female over-sexualization in gaming. There are also male gamers who argue that some of the sexualization of women in video games also applies to men in video games and that portraying a man or woman in a video game in a sexual way can be acceptable if done in the right context. [...] Perceptions about stereotypes concerning gamers themselves also vary among genders, as well as playing frequency of game genres. A study in the Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media said that women who play a lot of video games disagree more with stereotypes concerning gender in gaming and are more strongly drawn towards specific gaming genres than men, regardless of the men's gaming frequency.|$|E
2500|$|Emergency brakes do {{not stop}} very well, as the {{stopping}} force provided by the emergency brake {{is less than half}} the force of normal braking and takes much longer to stop a vehicle. For vehicles with manual transmissions, the mechanical emergency brake is routinely used to assist in hill starts as this frees both feet for use on the accelerator and clutch pedals. Even an unskilled motorist can get started without rolling backwards. It is inadvisable to use rear wheel emergency brakes when the standard brakes are available, unless <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the front wheels such as a tire blowout or slippery conditions risking a loss of control. Using the emergency brake while driving changes the traction balance between the front and rear of the vehicle, if over applied may lock the back wheels and skid the car into a handbrake turn. Handbrake turns are often used in street racing to initiate rear wheel drift. In conditions near freezing where it is both wet and icy, the emergency brake mechanics may freeze and be impossible to release until thawed. If only using the [...] "park" [...] function on a transmission to hold the car parked, there is no freezing problem.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 June 2016, Mohammad El Halabi, {{manager of}} World Vision in Gaza, {{was arrested at}} the Erez border {{crossing}} and charged by Israeli prosecutors with channeling its funds directly to Hamas, a listed terror organization. [...] A senior official with Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency, stated that Halabi was recruited by the military wing of Hamas in 2004 and instructed to penetrate World Vision. According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Halabi transferred cash to Hamas to help it in digging military tunnels and purchasing weapons. Muhammad Mahmoud, Halabi's lawyer, told Haaretz that his client {{has nothing to do}} with Hamas and that the fact that the investigation had lasted 55 days proves that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> evidence. Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence agency claims that about $48 million of World Vision resources were funneled to Hamas in just six years and another $80,000 was used for building a Hamas position in Beit Hanon and for paying salaries of Hamas members who fought against Israel in the 2014 war. World Vision confirmed that its funds are spent in accordance with legal requirements that contribute to peace and that the charity works closely with the UN and Red Cross. The charity initially defended Halabi as a “humanitarian”.|$|E

She then started working on her biography, titled Beloved Witch: An Autobiography. The book tells how she came to be a Wiccan and how she had carried on the tag of being a [...] "witch" [...] in a society where witches are still feared and hated. The book, after its release in November 2000, won critical acclaim. Nona Walia of The Times of India commented, [...] "Roy Chakraverti knows that it is unusual for well-bred Bengali girls to become witches and acknowledges her gratitude to her mother for allowing her the right to choose. After all, she says, every strong woman can be a witch in her own right, and that is perhaps the truest message that the book holds for the reader.

Later, Cannonball expresses his frustration about there only being a memorial for dead X-Men, including their brother Jay, in the faculty lounge and that he doesn't understand how Paige agrees with this decision when she can't even look at Jay's picture. Casting off Sam's feelings, Paige announces she has class and needs to change. In reply to this, Sam states that she sheds her skin every time she's unhappy and her power isn't an antidepressant. At that moment, the school is attacked, and Paige is instructed to go teach as normal. During her class, Rogue interrupts and informs Paige that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the [...] "heating system."

2500|$|At that time, the {{imperial}} administration was selecting many officials to fill its posts, {{and there were}} many officials who received positions after lying about their lineages or past experiences. [...] Emperor Taizong issued an edict ordering the officials to admit to their falsehoods, promising to spare them if they did so before a deadline, but stating that they would be executed if their falsehoods were discovered after the deadline. [...] When some officials were indeed discovered after the deadline to have falsified their lineages or past experiences, Emperor Taizong ordered that they be executed, but Dai rejected the order and instead sentenced them to exile. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "I issued an edict that those who did not admit would be executed, but you, lord, sentenced them only to exile. [...] This made my words not stand up to the people. [...] Are you betraying justice, lord?" [...] Dai responded, [...] "If Your Imperial Majesty had killed them on the spot, there would be nothing I could do. [...] Now that you have sent them to the supreme court, I have to follow the law." [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "You, lord, are following the law, but you are making me lose credibility." [...] Dai responded, [...] "The law is how the empire can keep its credibility. [...] Your Imperial Majesty made your words based on your feelings at that time, and you declared executions based on your anger. [...] By repudiating your action and putting them {{in the hands of the}} law, you are showing that you can hold back your anger and respect the state's credibility.

[...] Emperor Taizong was pleased and responded, [...] "I now know that if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the law, you, Duke, will correct it.

[...] It was said that Dai often spoke against Emperor Taizong's wishes in this way, and that as a result, people were not falsely convicted or punished while he was serving.|$|E
