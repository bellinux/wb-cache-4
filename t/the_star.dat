5|$|Many Christians believe <b>the</b> <b>star</b> was {{a miraculous}} sign {{to mark the}} birth of the Christ (or Messiah). Some theologians claimed that <b>the</b> <b>star</b> {{fulfilled}} a prophecy, known as <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> Prophecy. Astronomers have made several attempts to link <b>the</b> <b>star</b> to unusual astronomical events, such as a conjunction of Jupiter and Venus, a comet or a supernova.|$|E
5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting {{in an increase in}} the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause <b>the</b> <b>star</b> to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus <b>the</b> <b>star</b> forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Among Jehovah's Witnesses <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> of Bethlehem {{is seen as}} {{a product}} of Satan, rather than a sign from God, since <b>the</b> <b>star</b> led the astrologers to Jerusalem where they met King Herod's plan to kill Jesus.|$|E

5|$|As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 is {{much less}} massive than the Sun: {{estimates}} suggest it has only 32% {{of the mass of}} the Sun. The surface temperature of Gliese 876 is cooler than the Sun and <b>the</b> <b>star</b> has a smaller radius. These factors combine to make <b>the</b> <b>star</b> only 1.24% as luminous as the Sun, and most of this is at infrared wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of such dynamics, Pleione {{exhibits}} prominent long-term photometric and spectroscopic variations encompassing a period of about 35 years. In fact, during the last 100 years, Pleione has demonstrated notable phase changesas a Be phase until 1903, a B phase (1905–1936), a B-shell phase (1938–1954), and another Be phase (1955–1972). It then entered a Be-shell phase in 1972. Then, <b>the</b> <b>star</b> developed many shell absorption lines in its spectrum. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>star</b> showed a decrease in brightness, beginning at the end of 1971. After reaching the minimum brightness in late 1973, <b>the</b> <b>star</b> gradually brightened. In 1989, Pleione entered a Be phase and stayed as a Be star until the summer of 2005.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} shell burning produces more helium, the core increases in mass and temperature. In a red giant {{of up to}} 2.25 , {{the mass of the}} helium core becomes degenerate prior to helium fusion. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a helium flash, and <b>the</b> <b>star</b> rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and moves to the horizontal branch of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and <b>the</b> <b>star</b> spends some time in the red clump, slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and <b>the</b> <b>star</b> then moves to the horizontal branch.|$|E

5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than the Sun and significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years.

5|$|Estimating {{the age and}} {{metallicity}} of cool {{stars is}} difficult due {{to the formation of}} diatomic molecules in their atmospheres, which makes the spectrum extremely complex. By fitting the observed spectrum to model spectra, it is estimated that Gliese 876 has a slightly lower abundance of heavy elements compared to the Sun (around 75% the solar abundance of iron). Based on chromospheric activity <b>the</b> <b>star</b> is likely to be around 6.5 to 9.9 billion years old, depending on the theoretical model used. However, the low rotational period of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> as well as its membership among the young disk population suggest that <b>the</b> <b>star</b> is between 0.1–5 billion years old.|$|E
