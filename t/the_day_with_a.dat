5|$|Foundation Day: Celebrated every 6 November. Initially the Barnard Run {{was held}} on this day. Before 1892 the {{tradition}} was to celebrate <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> paper chase, but this was replaced after Lord Barnard donated the Barnard Cup.|$|E
5|$|Paciorek, {{who was the}} {{starting}} right fielder, began <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> walk in the second inning. He then had a single in the fourth inning, which drove in Rusty Staub and Bob Aspromonte. After singling and again bringing home Aspromonte in the fifth, Paciorek had {{a walk in the}} sixth, and ended <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> leadoff single in the eighth. In total, he went to the plate five times and hit three singles and had two walks, scoring four runs en route to a 134 Houston victory over the New York Mets. He had a perfect major league career batting average and on-base percentage of 1.000 {{as a result of his}} performance that day, something no one else with as many plate appearances as Paciorek has done.|$|E
5|$|In GT1, the No. 63 Corvette {{recorded}} the fastest time of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 3:49.207, {{followed by the}} No. 007 Aston Martin and the second factory Corvette.

5|$|On January 28, Khánh {{flew from}} Huế to Saigon dressed in {{civilian}} clothes on a commercial airliner. He covered for his ruse by claiming that he was travelling with United States military adviser Colonel Jasper Wilson and stating {{that he had come}} for a dental appointment. This came after Duc had arrived in I Corps earlier in <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> message from the other plotters that Khánh was to be in Saigon to lead the coup on the day after. What Khánh had actually done was to send Wilson to Saigon earlier in the day to check with the embassy and confirm that Washington did support the coup.|$|E
5|$|The Dominion of India {{became an}} {{independent}} country as official ceremonies {{took place in}} New Delhi. Nehru assumed office as the first prime minister, and the viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, continued as its first governor general. Gandhi's name was invoked by crowds celebrating the occasion; Gandhi himself however took no part in the official events. Instead, he marked <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 24-hour fast, during which he spoke to a crowd in Calcutta, encouraging peace between Hindu and Muslim.|$|E

50|$|In week 8, {{another trip}} {{to play the}} Carolina Panthers saw the Seattle defense allow 9 points and 266 yards, just enough for the 13-9 win. Marcus Burley, a 5th corner forced into action due to injuries, was the key member of the Legion on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{interception}} and 24-yard return.|$|R
5|$|Until 1999, a draw in {{the final}} {{would result in the}} match being replayed at a later date; since then the final has always been decided on <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> penalty shootout as required. As of 2017 a penalty {{shoot-out}} has been required on only two occasions, in the 2005 and 2006 finals. The competition did not take place during the First and Second World Wars, other than in the 1914–15 season, when it was completed, and the 1939–40 season, when it was abandoned during the qualifying rounds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Alonso set the fastest lap of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> time of 1:39.283; Red Bull drivers Vettel and Webber {{finished with the}} second and third-fastest times. Rosberg was fourth, ahead of Hamilton and Kubica. Massa, Adrian Sutil, Button and Barrichello followed in the top-ten. Massa caused the session to be disrupted after spinning in the fourth corner and narrowly avoided making contact with the barrier. The session was red-flagged to allow Massa's car {{to be removed from}} the centre of the track to be taken to the pit lane. Timo Glock's lost the use of his car's fifth gear and pulled {{over to the side of}} the track at turn twelve which prematurely ended his running. Vitaly Petrov spun at the exit of turn 14 and reversed his car to rejoin the circuit, avoiding the need for a red-flag. Vettel was the fastest driver in the final practice session with a lap of 1:38.052; Webber was third-fastest. Kubica separated the two Red Bull drivers in second, with Sutil fourth. Alonso was fifth-fastest, and Barrichello was sixth. Vitantonio Liuzzi, Massa, Button and Hamilton rounded out the top ten.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Bräck set the fastest time of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lap of 31:676 seconds, ahead of Junqueira and Tracy. Tagliani was fourth-fastest; Memo Gidley was fifth and Shinji Nakano sixth. Carpentier, Bryan Herta, Takagi and da Matta {{followed in the}} top ten.

50|$|Playbills {{and posters}} {{were created by}} leading artists of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unglamorized, gritty realism that {{reflected}} {{the spirit of the}} theatre and its repertoire. Among the artists that produced the most memorable works for its plays were Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Édouard Vuillard, Paul Signac, George Auriol, Adolphe Willette, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.|$|R
30|$|In all the 3  years, {{seasonal}} variations are clearly seen {{in both the}} daily R-T growth rate and EPB occurrence, which are maximum in the two equinoxes.

50|$|Flora Eaton was {{a member}} of the Toronto Hunt Club. In 1929, it split into the Eglinton Hunt Club and the Toronto and North York Hunt Club. Hunters of the latter held regular outings, meeting for breakfast at Eaton Hall, riding in the {{adjacent}} Pellatt Estate, then ending <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> afternoon tea at Eaton Hall.|$|R
5|$|Paul Thompson had {{a disappointing}} day as he {{completed}} {{only three of}} his twelve passing attempts {{for a total of}} 39yards. A's Stephen McGee was slightly better completing 8 of 18 for 63yards, though he was picked off by Marcus Walker in the third quarter; Garrett Hartley kicked a field goal after the Sooners offense could not advance the ball after the turnover. The Aggies forced two fumbles of their own (one from Patrick and one from Thompson), but they were forced to punt after their own offense was also stymied. The player of the game was Allen Patrick, who finished <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> career-high 173yards on 32 carries and one touchdown. However, he suffered a sprained ankle during the last minutes of the game. Coach Wilson questioned whether he would be 100% for the next game. Texas A coach Dennis Franchione dropped to 04 against the Sooners.|$|E
5|$|Periods of rain {{impacted}} the British Isles {{early in}} the morning of 10 January, progressing from west to east. Wet and windy weather was seen across the region during <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wintry mix of precipitation falling across northern sections of Britain. Within the area of wintry mix, the wind combined with the ongoing snowfall led to blizzards across most of Scotland. Precipitation became more showery in nature during the evening hours. Thunderstorms were observed despite the near-freezing temperature readings. Wind and waves associated with this storm were too much for the tanker MV Braer, which had become lodged on rocks in the Shetland Islands nearly a week beforehand. The tanker broke up and her remaining cargo of 84,500tons of light crude oil spilled into the ocean surrounding the islands. The rough conditions caused by this storm led to the rapid breakup of visible oil slicks.|$|E
5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were {{held on the}} Friday before the race: each lasted for an hour. A third session, also an hour long, {{took place on the}} Saturday morning prior to qualifying. Franchitti was fastest in the first practice session with a time of one minute and 3.0885 seconds; Dixon was second and Power third. Hélio Castroneves was fourth-fastest, ahead of Justin Wilson and Paul Tracy. Ryan Briscoe, Ryan Hunter-Reay, E. J. Viso and Takuma Sato rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. The session was stopped twice: firstly for Milka Duno who lost control of her car and went into the turn ten tire barrier damaging her front wing, and then Bertrand Baguette spun after hitting a chicane kerb which caused to him to drive through an advertising billboard. In the second practice session, Power set the fastest time of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lap of one minute and 1.6689 seconds, with his teammates Briscoe in second and Castroneves third. Franchitti recorded the fourth-quickest time; Sato was fifth and Dixon sixth. Wilson, Viso, Tracy and Tony Kanaan followed in the top ten. Three caution flags came out; Baugette crashed, Duno stalled after she spun and Tomas Scheckter slid into a tire barrier.|$|E

50|$|Day Three, 6-7 hours, 16.5 km. <b>The</b> <b>day</b> begins <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{moderate}} {{climb back}} to Emerald Lakes then down a relatively steep descent to Oturere Hut. One can see many abstractly formed lava formations on the way. Passing Oturere Hut the track fades into field of gravel lacking vegetation. <b>The</b> <b>day</b> finishes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> valley crossing and ascent through forest, then a descent to Waihohonu hut.|$|R

5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, a further four stoppages occurred; Alex Zanardi slid and made light {{contact with the}} turn eight tire barrier and did not restart, metal debris was spotted in between turns three and four, Max Wilson stalled his car after he spun in the third turn, and Franchitti and Memo Gidley made contact in turn five and the latter was sent into the tire barrier which heavily damaged his right-hand suspension while Franchitti's right-front wheel broke. De Ferran set the fastest lap of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> time of 58.400 seconds, ahead of Fittipaldi and Franchitti. Kanaan was fourth-fastest; ahead of Andretti and his teammate Tracy. Da Matta, Tagliani, Max Papis and Adrián Fernández followed in the top ten. Shinji Nakano paced the final practice session {{with a time of}} 58.133 seconds; Kanaan was second and Junqueira third. De Ferran was fourth-quickest, ahead of Andretti and da Matta. Oriol Servià was seventh-fastest, Bryan Herta eighth, Fernández ninth and Maurício Gugelmin completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. The session was stopped four times: firstly for Vasser who stalled on the circuit; the second for Kanaan because his engine failed heading towards the start-finish line, the third was for Bräck who slid and hit the turn eight outside tyre wall with his left front wheel and his suspension was broken. The final red-flag was for Vasser who locked his brakes and spun 360 degrees into the turn eight run off area.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the track}} dried up despite a light rain shower before the second {{practice}} session and drivers recorded more lap times {{to make up for}} the lack of running in the first session. Some drivers also went off the circuit. Alonso set the fastest lap of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> time of 1:16.265; Massa finished with the third-fastest time. The two Red Bull drivers were second and fourth (with Vettel ahead of Webber). All of the top four quickest drivers set their fastest lap times on the super-soft dry compound tyre. Rosberg was fifth-fastest (despite damaging his front wing after he collided with a kerb bollard), ahead of his Mercedes teammate Michael Schumacher in sixth. Hamilton, Kubica, Barrichello and Hülkenberg followed in the top ten. A heavy rain shower hit the circuit on Saturday morning which stopped before the final practice session started. Drivers were initially forced to use intermediate tyres before switching later to dry-weather conditions and the teams worked on car set-up for qualifying. Vettel set the fastest lap, a 1:15.503; Webber finished with the third-fastest time. They were separated by the Ferrari drivers in second and fourth (with Alonso ahead of Massa). Rosberg duplicated his second-session result in fifth, with Hamilton in sixth. Schumacher, Barrichello, Kubica and Hülkenberg completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Sutil was unable to record a lap time when his Force India's driveshaft broke though he managed to return to his garage and lost 45 minutes of running.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Hostetler {{converted}} his third fourth down of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 9-yard scramble on fourth and 6, and eventually finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown run, putting his team up 24-3. Chicago {{responded with a}} drive to the Giants 5-yard line. On fourth and goal, Muster caught a pass at the 1, but was dropped by linebackers Pepper Johnson and Gary Reasons {{before he could get}} across the goal line. In the fourth quarter, Giants defensive back Everson Walls returned an interception 37 yards to the Giants 49. The Giants then went on a grueling 51-yard drive consisting of 16 running plays, the last a 1-yard touchdown plunge by fullback Maurice Carthon, that ate up a staggering 10:30 of play time.|$|E
25|$|An {{autogyro}} (from Greek αὐτός + γύρος, self-turning), {{also known}} as gyroplane, gyrocopter, or rotaplane, {{is a type of}} rotorcraft that uses an unpowered rotor in autorotation to develop lift, and an engine-powered propeller, similar to that of a fixed-wing aircraft, to provide thrust. While similar to a helicopter rotor in appearance, the autogyro's rotor must have air flowing through the rotor disc to generate rotation. Invented by the Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva to create an aircraft that could fly safely at low speeds, the autogyro was first flown on 9 January 1923, at Cuatro Vientos Airfield in Madrid. De la Cierva's aircraft resembled the fixed-wing aircraft of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> front-mounted engine and propeller in a tractor configuration to pull the aircraft through the air.|$|E
