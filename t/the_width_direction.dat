40|$|A set of {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine {{the characteristics of the}} combustion species emissions and heat transfer from an premixed slot butane/air Bunsen flame jet impinging on a cold flat plate. The Reynolds numbers were selected to be 1200 and 1700, which were the representative of the laminar and the transitional flame, respectively. The dimensionless nozzle-to-plate distances were 2 and 6, representing small and moderate distances, respectively. All the tests were carried out under an equivalence ratio of 1. It was found that the enhancement of heat transfer of Reynolds number was significant only in the impingement and the early wall jet regions because combustion occurred solely in this region. Beyond this, no combustion was observed. The flame reaction zone occurred around the stagnation point for the transitional flame under moderate nozzle-toplate distance because of the increased turbulence and the considerable high velocity when the flame impinged on the plate. A cool central core with low heat fluxes and a great amount of unburnt hydrocarbon and oxygen was found when either the flame became laminar or the nozzle-to-plate distance was small. The rectangular nozzle shape determined a nonuniform fuel/air gas flow with more gas exiting along <b>the</b> nozzle <b>width</b> <b>direction</b> than <b>the</b> nozzle length direction.

30|$|As {{suggested}} {{in our previous}} studies, the formation mechanism of the Mn silicide NWs {{can be attributed to}} the anisotropic lattice mismatch between the Mn silicide and the Si(110) substrate [20, 21]. In <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>direction</b> of NWs (i.e., Si[001] direction), the lattice mismatch has a relatively large value, and the adatoms are not easily attached to the two long edges of the NWs because of the high strain energy, leading to the limited growth along this direction. However, with extension of deposition time, more Mn atoms are supplied, and this will introduce dislocations in the NWs [9, 27, 28], resulting in the fragmentation of NWs and, finally, the reduction in their lengths. Meanwhile, the dislocations can relax the high strain along <b>the</b> <b>width</b> <b>direction</b> of NWs and thus make the adatoms attach to the wire edges more easily, leading to the increase in the wire width and height. The ‘A’-type change of the NWs shown in Figure 5 c,d can be considered as a result induced by the dislocations. On the other hand, the appearance of ‘B’-type change of the NWs at a deposition time of 25 min (Figure 5 c) indicates that the growth of NWs at this stage undergoes Ostwald ripening. Compared to large 3 D islands, NWs have a large surface-to-volume ratio and thus a high chemical potential. According to the Gibbs-Thomson principle, the atoms would dissolve from thin NWs, diffuse over the surface, and finally attach to the large 3 D islands, making the 3 D islands become larger and the NWs become thinner until they disappear.|$|E
