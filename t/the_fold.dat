5|$|The adipose fin, {{which is}} present in over 6,000 teleost species, is often thought to have evolved once in the lineage and to have been lost {{multiple}} times due to its limited function.

40|$|Molecular chaperones {{are known}} to be {{essential}} for avoiding protein aggregation in vivo, but it is still unclear how they affect protein folding mechanisms. We use single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer to follow <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> of a protein inside the GroEL/GroES chaperonin cavity over a time range from milliseconds to hours. Our results show that confinement in the chaperonin decelerates <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> of <b>the</b> C-terminal domain in the substrate protein rhodanese, but leaves <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> rate of <b>the</b> N-terminal domain unaffected. Microfluidic mixing experiments indicate that strong interactions of the substrate with the cavity walls impede <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> process, but <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> hierarchy is preserved. Our results imply that no universal chaperonin mechanism exists. Rather, a competition between intra- and intermolecular interactions determines <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> rates and mechanisms of a substrate inside the GroEL/GroES cage...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>folding</b> of {{ribonuclease}} A (RNase A) {{has been}} extensively studied by characterizing the disulfide containing intermediates using different experimental conditions and analytical techniques. So far, some aspects still remain unclear such as {{the role of the}} loop 65 - 72 in <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> pathway. We have studied <b>the</b> oxidative <b>folding</b> of a RNase A derivative containing at position 67 the substitution Asn [...] > isoAsp where the local structure of the loop 65 - 72 has been modified keeping intact the C 65 -C 72 disulfide bond. By comparing <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> behavior of this mutant to that of the wild-type protein, we found that the deamidation significantly decreases <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> rate and alters <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> pathway of RNase A. Results presented here shed light {{on the role of the}} 65 - 72 region in <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> process of RNase A and also clarifies the effect of the deamidation on the folding/unfolding processes.

The signing was sharply criticized by local and national media, though reaction amongst fans was mixed as polls suggested only a minority opposed the moves.|$|E

40|$|A full {{structural}} description of transition state ensembles in protein <b>folding</b> includes <b>the</b> specificity of the ordered residues composing <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> nucleus {{as well as}} spatial density. To our knowledge, the spatial properties of <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> nucleus and interface of specific nuclei have yet to receive significant attention. We analyze folding routes predicted by a variational model {{in terms of a}} generalized formalism of the capillarity scaling theory that assumes the volume of <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> core of <b>the</b> nucleus grows with chain length as Vf ≈ N 3 ν. For 27 two-state proteins studied, the scaling exponent ν ranges from 0. 2 to 0. 45 with an average of 0. 33. This average value corresponds to packing of rigid objects, although generally the effective monomer size in <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> core is larger than the corresponding volume per particle in the native-state ensemble. That is, on average, <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> core of <b>the</b> nucleus is found to be relatively diffuse. We also study the growth of <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> nucleus and interface along <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> route in terms of the density or packing fraction. The evolution of <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> core and interface regions can be classified into three patterns of growth depending on how the growth of <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> core is balanced by changes in density of the interface. Finally, we quantify the diffuse versus polarized structure of the critical nucleus through direct calculation of the packing fraction of <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> core and interface regions.

5|$|Peter then {{returned}} to Constantinople with letters from Theodahad and the Roman Senate to the imperial couple, bearing pleas for a peaceful solution, {{but by the time}} he reached the imperial capital, Emperor Justinian had resolved on war and was preparing his forces. Consequently, Peter returned to Italy in the summer of 535 conveying an ultimatum: only if Theodahad abdicated and returned Italy to imperial rule, could war be averted. A two-pronged Byzantine offensive followed soon thereafter, attacking the outlying possessions of the Ostrogothic kingdom: Belisarius took Sicily, while Mundus invaded Dalmatia. Upon hearing these news, Theodahad despaired, and Peter was able to secure wide-ranging concessions from him: Sicily was to be ceded to the Byzantine Empire; the Gothic king's authority within Italy was severely restricted; a gold crown was to be sent as an annual tribute and up to 3,000 men were to be provided for the imperial army, underlining Theodahad's subject status. Theodahad, however, fearing that his first offer would be rejected, then instructed Peter, under oath, to offer the cession of all Italy, but only if the original concessions were rejected by Justinian. In the event, Justinian rejected the first proposal, and was delighted to learn of the second one. Peter was sent back to Italy with Athanasius, bearing letters to Theodahad and the Gothic nobles, and for a time it seemed as if the cradle of the Roman Empire would return peacefully to <b>the</b> <b>fold.</b> It was not to be: upon their arrival in Ravenna, the Byzantine envoys found Theodahad in a changed disposition.
