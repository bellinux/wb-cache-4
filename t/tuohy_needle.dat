40|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{results with}} regard to the use of catheter-based techniques for continuous paravertebral block. Local anaesthetic spread within the paravertebral space is limited and the clinical effect is often variable. Discrepancies between needle tip position and final catheter position can also be problematic. The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to assess the reliability of placing a newly developed coiled catheter in human cadavers. Sixty <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needles</b> and coiled catheters were placed under ultrasound guidance, three {{on each side of the}} thoracic vertebral column in 10 human cadavers. Computed tomography was used to assess needle tip and catheter tip locations. No catheter was misplaced into the epidural, pleural or prevertebral spaces. The mean (SD) distance between catheter tips and needle tips was 8. 2 (4. 9) mm. The median (IQR [range]) caudo-cephalad spread of contrast dye injectate through a subset of 20 catheters was 4 (4 - 5 [3 - 8]) thoracic segments. All catheters were removed without incident. Precise paravertebral catheter placement can be achieved using ultrasound-guided placement of a coiled catheter...|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, a {{two-level}} {{approach may}} be undertaken. The epidural space is first {{located in the}} standard manner. Then, at another level, a standard spinal is performed. Finally, the epidural catheter is threaded through the <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needle.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} epidural pack may be {{used with}} a standard spinal needle. However, the standard length of a spinal needle (90mm) may be insufficiently long to reach the subarachnoid space through the <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needle.</b> An extra-long needle (e.g. 120mm) may be required.|$|E
5000|$|For some procedures, the {{anaesthetist}} {{may choose}} to combine the rapid onset and reliable, dense block of a spinal anaesthetic with the post-operative analgesic effects of an epidural. This is called combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia (CSE). The practitioner may insert the spinal anaesthetic at one level, and the epidural at an adjacent level. Alternatively, after locating the epidural space with the <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needle,</b> a spinal needle may be inserted through the <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needle</b> into the subarachnoid space. The spinal dose is then given, the spinal needle withdrawn, and the epidural catheter inserted as normal. This method, known as the [...] "needle-through-needle" [...] technique, {{may be associated with}} a slightly higher risk of placing the catheter into the subarachnoid space.|$|E
40|$|Background: Epidural {{anaesthesia}} {{is being}} increasingly {{used to provide}} anaesthesia for surgery on the lower abdomen, perineum and lower extremities. However success of the epidural technique depends upon the correct identification of epidural space. [2] We conducted a study to find the distance from skin to the epidural space and its correlation with body mass index, to improve the success rate. Patient and Methods: 120 adults patients belonging to ASA physical status I and II in {{the age group of}} 18 - 70 years, scheduled for surgery and or pain relief under epidural block, were taken up for the study. 60 patients of either sex were further subdivided into 2 subgroups of 30 patients each having BMI less than 30 or more than 30. The distance from skin to epidural space was measured as the distance between rubber marker and tip of <b>Tuohy′s</b> <b>needle.</b> Results: It was found that with increase in Body mass Index, the distance from skin to the epidural space also increases. The distance from the skin to the epidural space does not depend on the age or the sex of the patients. Conclusions: We formulated predictive equation of depth of epidural space from skin in relation to BMI based on linear regression analysis as: Depth (mm) = a + b (BMI).

40|$|Background: Differences in needle design may impact nerve localization. This study {{evaluates the}} {{electrical}} properties of two insulated <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needles</b> using computational finite element modeling. Methods: Three-dimensional geometric computer-based models were created representing two 18 -gauge, insulated Tuohy needles: (1) with an exposed metal tip and (2) with an insulated tip. The models were projected in simulated human tissue. Using finite element methodology, distributions of current-density were calculated. Voltages in the modeled medium were calculated, and activation patterns {{of a model}} nerve fiber around the tip of each needle were estimated using the activating function. Results: Maximum current density on the exposed-tip needle occurred {{along the edge of}} the distal tip; the distal edge was 1. 7 times larger than the side edges and 3. 5 times larger than the proximal edge. Conversely, maximum current density occurred along the proximal edge of the insulated-tip Tuohy opening; the proximal edge was 1. 9 times larger than the side edges of the opening and 3. 5 times larger than the distal edge of the opening. Voltages generated by the exposed-tip needle were larger and had a wider spatial distribution than that of the insulated-tip needle, which restricted to the area immediately adjacent to the opening. Different changes in threshold were predicted to excite a nerve fiber as the needles were rotated or advanced toward the modeled nerve. Conclusions: The needles displayed different asymmetric distributions of current density and positional effects on threshold. If this analysis is validated clinically, it may prove useful in testing stimulating needles before clinical application. (C) 2009 American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc...|$|R

A member of the study group (either EB or HG) performed all procedures. Briefly, a 20 Gauge catheter (B.Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) was inserted 3  cm into the paravertebral space at thoracic level 3 – 4, using an 18 Gauge <b>Tuohy</b> cannula <b>needle.</b> After a test dose of 3  ml ropivacaine 0.75 %, a total dose of 0.25  ml/kg ropivacaine 0.75 % was injected.

The Netherlands) via the catheter.|$|R
5000|$|Variants {{like the}} Brace needle, a Crawford variant; the Lutz {{epidural}} needle (1963), with a pencil-point design for single-shot epidural use; the Scott needle (1985), a <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needle</b> with a Luer lock hub; and the Eldor needle (1993), {{designed for use}} with combined spinal epidural anesthesia.|$|E
50|$|The caudal {{approach}} to the epidural space {{involves the use of}} a <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needle,</b> an intravenous catheter, or a hypodermic needle to puncture the sacrococcygeal membrane. Injecting local anaesthetic at this level can result in analgesia and/or anaesthesia of the perineum and groin areas. The caudal epidural technique is often used in infants and children undergoing surgery involving the groin, pelvis or lower extremities. In this population, caudal epidural analgesia is usually combined with general anaesthesia since most children do not tolerate surgery when regional anaesthesia is employed as the sole modality.|$|E
5000|$|In 1921, Spanish {{military}} surgeon Fidel Pagés (18861923) {{developed the}} modern technique of lumbar epidural anesthesia, which was popularized in the 1930s by Italian surgery professor Achille Mario Dogliotti (18971966).

The epidural space was identified using hanging drop or loss of resistance technique and 10  mL of 0.25  % bupivacaine was administered as a bolus into the space. Afterwards, an epidural catheter (Perifix-Katheter, B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) was inserted 2 – 4  cm into the epidural space. The level of anesthesia was determined by loss of pinprick sensation (Th 1 –Th 10). Then, continuous epidural infusion using plain 0.25  % bupivacaine was applied with a rate of 7 – 10  mL/h {{till the end of}} surgery. After epidural puncture GA was induced and maintained using isoflurane in the same dosage as in the GA group. When required additional sufentanil was administered according to the pain response.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{methods for}} haptic modelling of soft and hard tissue with varying stiffness. The model provides visualization of deformation and calculates force feedback during simulated epidural needle insertion. A spring-mass-damper (SMD) network is configured from {{magnetic resonance image}} (MRI) slices of patient’s lumbar region to represent varying stiffness throughout tissue structure. Reaction force is calculated from the SMD network and a haptic device is configured to produce a needle insertion simulation. The user can feel the changing forces as the needle is inserted through tissue layers and ligaments. Methods for calculating the force feedback at various depths of needle insertion are presented. Voxelization is used to fill ligament surface meshes with spring mass damper assemblies for simulated needle insertion into soft and hard tissues. Modelled vertebrae cannot be pierced by the needle. Graphs were produced during simulated needle insertions to compare the applied force to haptic reaction force. Preliminary saline pressure measurements during <b>Tuohy</b> epidural <b>needle</b> insertion are also used {{as a basis for}} forces generated in the simulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to report our experience and illustrate our technique in the use of fibrin glue in the treatment of post-operatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks and collections following different neurosurgical procedures. In a 3 -year period, 40 subjects underwent endoscopic endonasal approach for different sellar and skull base lesions (three tuberculum sellae meningiomas, six craniopharyngiomas, three Rathke's cleft cysts and 28 pituitary macroadenomas), in which an intraoperative CSF leakage was evident. In such subjects, the fibrin glue was used as a first step of the final phase of the procedure-i. e. the reconstruction of the skull base defect-followed by the other materials employed. Furthermore, ten other patients, who had undergone transsphenoidal (four cases), spinal (two cases), posterior fossa (three cases) and transcortical intraventricular tumour removal (one case) neurosurgical procedures and developed CSF leaks or collections, were conservatively treated by single or repeated in situ injections of "modified" fibrin glue under local anaesthesia according to different described techniques. In total, 50 patients constitute the clinical material of the present study. In the cases where the fibrin glue was used during the reconstruction phase of the procedure (40 cases), the glue was injected inside the tumour cavity to fill the dead space left by the removal of the lesion. In case of post-operative CSF leak or CSF fluid collection (ten cases), after discarding 50 - 80 % of the thrombin solution to obtain prevalence of the product's adhesive properties, fibrin glue was injected directly in the path of the CSF leak or into the collection cavity after aspiration of the collection's content. This was performed with the provided application system or through lumbar or <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needles.</b> Applications were repeated every 48 h until the disappearance of the leak. In all the treated cases, the disappearance of CSF leaks or collections was obtained with a number of applications ranging from one to five. Successful results are stable with a follow-up ranging from 6 months to 3 years. In our experience, the injection of fibrin glue has proved to be effective in filling or sealing post-operative "dead spaces" and treating minor or initial CSF leaks resulting from procedures of transsphenoidal, cranial and spinal surgery, adding another possibility in the management of many of these dreadful complications...|$|R
50|$|The subject {{may be in}} the seated, lateral or prone positions. The {{level of}} the spine at which the {{catheter}} is best placed depends mainly on the site and type of an intended operation or the anatomical origin of pain. The iliac crest is a commonly used anatomical landmark for lumbar epidural injections, as this level roughly corresponds with the fourth lumbar vertebra, which is usually well below the termination of the spinal cord. The <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needle</b> is usually inserted in the midline, between the spinous processes. When using a paramedian approach, the tip of the needle passes along a shelf of vertebral bone called the lamina until just before reaching the ligamentum flavum and the epidural space.|$|E
50|$|The first {{described}} placement of a lumbar epidural catheter {{was performed by}} Pío Manuel María Martínez Curbelo (5 June 19061 May 1962) on January 13, 1947. Curbelo, a Cuban anesthesiologist, introduced a 16 gauge <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needle</b> into the left flank of a 40-year-old woman with a large ovarian cyst. Through this needle, he introduced a 3.5 French ureteral catheter made of elastic silk into the lumbar epidural space. He then removed the needle, leaving the catheter in place and repeatedly injected 0.5% percaine (cinchocaine, also known as dibucaine) to achieve anesthesia. Curbelo presented his work on September 9, 1947, at the 22nd Joint Congress of the International Anesthesia Research Society and the International College of Anesthetists, in New York City.|$|E
50|$|Permanent lead {{placement}} may {{be carried}} out under general anesthetic or local anesthetic with sedation. First, a small incision is made {{at the base of}} the skull, then a <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needle</b> is advanced under fluoroscopic guidance towards the location of the greater occipital nerve and lesser occipital nerve on one side of the head. When the lead is adequately positioned through the needle under fluoroscopic guidance, the needle is carefully removed and the lead is fixed in place. Since most patients require two leads, a second lead is usually inserted and fixed in place on the other side of the head in the same way. The lead(s) are then tunneled to a neurostimulator device which is usually implanted the buttock, chest, low abdomen, beneath the shoulder blade or below the clavicle.|$|E
5000|$|In most cases, a trial (test) lead {{placement}} {{is performed}} {{in order to}} assess whether the stimulation will work as expected. Local anesthetic is applied {{to the back of the}} neck and a <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needle</b> is advanced towards the location of the greater occipital nerve and lesser occipital nerve under fluoroscopic guidance. When the location is confirmed, a temporary lead is placed through the needle before the needle is carefully removed. Electrical impulses are sent through the lead and its position is adjusted until the patient reports a [...] "pins-and-needles" [...] sensation, called paresthesia, across the areas of the nerves. If paresthesia is successfully achieved in the right place, permanent leads are usually implanted at a later date. In some cases, the trial leads are left in for up to one week to see whether there is any relief of symptoms.|$|E

30|$|Breakage of a {{catheter}} usually occurs during insertion or removal procedures. In this case, {{analysis of the}} fragment revealed that the catheter had been severed by {{the cutting edge of}} the <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needle</b> or the suture needle.

To prevent movement or removal, once the catheter is placed, it should be fixed to the skin with sutures, surgical tapes, or skin glue. Although secure fixation can be achieved with sutures, the suture needle may damage the catheter. Therefore, {{to reduce the risk of}} damage to the catheter, it is necessary to consider the method of catheter fixation. After removal of a catheter, its tip should be checked to ensure that the entire catheter has been completely removed. In this case, it is likely that the tip of the catheter was not checked after catheter removal.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Detecting {{inadvertent}} dural puncture during labour epidural insertion can {{be difficult}} when using a loss of resistance to saline technique. Testing fluid for glucose that leaks from a <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needle</b> may confirm the presence of cerebrospinal fluid and infer inadvertent dural puncture. This study compared the glucose content of intrathecal fluid obtained during spinal anaesthesia for elective caesarean delivery with that of fluid from a <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needle</b> or epidural catheter when establishing epidural analgesia for labour. METHODS: Women aged ≥ 18 years undergoing elective caesarean delivery and labouring parturients who requested epidural analgesia were recruited prospectively in a tertiary referral centre over a three-month period. Fluid was collected into a sterile container either during spinal anaesthesia or from a labour epidural needle. Glucose content was evaluated using a bedside blood glucometer and laboratory colorimetric analyzer. RESULTS: Of the 118 women approached, 115 participated. All 40 women having spinal anaesthesia and 2 / 75 (2. 7 %) women having epidural analgesia, in whom inadvertent dural puncture was subsequently confirmed, had fluid samples testing positive for glucose. Median [range] laboratory glucose readings were 2. 9 [1. 3 - 5. 1] mmol/L for cerebrospinal fluid and < 0. 3 mmol/L in fluid that leaked from a <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needle</b> (P= 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: When using a loss of resistance to saline technique for epidural catheter placement, bedside glucometer testing of fluid leaking from the epidural needle may be of value in the early detection of inadvertent dural puncture.

40|$|Abstract Background Paravertebral {{catheters}} {{are generally}} inserted and removed without complications. However, catheter breakage occurs rarely. This {{is the first}} report describing breakage of a thoracic paravertebral catheter and retention of the catheter fragment within the patient. Case presentation A 65 -year-old female patient complained of an unusual sensation in her back during postoperative chemotherapy for lung cancer. A catheter fragment was identified in the soft tissues of the back on computed tomography. The paravertebral catheter had been placed 20 years prior left lower lobectomy. The patient had neither neurological symptoms nor infection signs around the fragment. However, the potential side effects of chemotherapy, including coagulopathy and immunosuppression, increased the risk of late-onset hematoma and abscess formation around the fragment. Therefore, we surgically removed the catheter fragment. Analysis of the fragment revealed that the catheter had been severed by {{the cutting edge of}} the <b>Tuohy</b> <b>needle</b> or the suture needle. Conclusion In this report, a paravertebral catheter fragment was retained in the posterior mediastinum for 20 years. The catheter was likely damaged during the insertion procedure.
