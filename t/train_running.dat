5|$|The Coast Starlight began {{operating}} with Superliners in January 1981. The Sunset Limited, a long-distance <b>train</b> <b>running</b> {{along the southern}} border of the United States between Los Angeles and New Orleans, gained them in February, resulting in a commendation from the Texas State Legislature.

Superliner assignments became permanent in the 1990s. Amtrak estimated that reequipping a train with Superliners boosted ridership on it by 25%. The last car of the order, a sleeper delivered in July 1981, was also the last car ever built by Pullman, and was {{named in honor of}} the company's founder, George Mortimer Pullman.|$|E
5|$|Beacon Hill Station {{opened to}} the public on July 18, 2009 during a weekend of free service celebrating the inaugural day of Central Link service. The line's opening was delayed from its {{projected}} July 3 date due in part to slowdowns in Beacon Hill construction. The year after the line opened, nine air pockets above the tunnel, caused by soil slides above the tunnel boring machine, were discovered and filled with cement to prevent sinkholes. Service to the southbound platforms at Beacon Hill and Mount Baker were suspended for a daylong emergency drill in November 2010, briefly restricting service to the northbound platform while maintaining a 10-minute headway. During a winter storm in January 2012, an overnight <b>train</b> <b>running</b> to keep the overhead catenary free of ice stalled inside the Beacon Hill Tunnel, allowing for ice build up that canceled Link service for several hours. In late 2013, Beacon Hill Station was closed for two hours after the discovery of smoke in the tunnel, station, and nearby Mount Baker Station, coming from a homeless encampment {{on the west side of}} Beacon Hill. The incident prompted Sound Transit to hold meetings with the Seattle Fire Department on preventing a total system shut-down in the event of an electrical fire.|$|E
5|$|Ray {{gathered}} an inexperienced crew, {{although both}} his cameraman Subrata Mitra and art director Bansi Chandragupta {{went on to}} achieve great acclaim. The cast consisted of mostly amateur actors. He started shooting in late 1952 with his personal savings and hoped to raise more money once he had some passages shot, but did not succeed on his terms. As a result, Ray shot Pather Panchali over three years, an unusually long period, based on when he or his production manager Anil Chowdhury could raise additional funds. He refused funding from sources who wanted a change in script or supervision over production. He also ignored advice from the government to incorporate a happy ending, but he did receive funding {{that allowed him to}} complete the film. Ray showed an early film passage to the American director John Huston, who was in India scouting locations for The Man Who Would Be King. The passage was of the vision which Apu and his sister have of the <b>train</b> <b>running</b> through the countryside, the only sequence which Ray had yet filmed due to his small budget. Huston notified Monroe Wheeler at the New York Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) that a major talent was on the horizon.|$|E
