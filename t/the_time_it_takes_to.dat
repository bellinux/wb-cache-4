Symantec funded the benchmark test and provided scripts used to benchmark each participating antivirus software. Tests {{were conducted in}} Windows Vista running on a dual core processor. PC Magazine found the suite added 15 seconds to the boot time, with a baseline of 60 seconds. Norton added less than 5 percent to <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> complete file operations. 25 percent more time was taken to unzip and zip a set of files.|$|E
5|$|The {{gravitational}} attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth. The {{same effect}} on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period {{is the same as}} <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator.|$|E

The first stations are planned to be deployed along Interstate 5 in California where, according to Tesla, {{a large number of}} Model S sedans make the San Francisco-Los Angeles trip regularly. These will be followed by the Washington, DC to Boston corridor.|$|E

25|$|Word naming task: During a word naming task, a {{participant}} is {{presented with a}} drawing or object and is asked to name the drawing or the object.

Sometimes response accuracies are recorded as well. An example of this word naming task is the Boston Naming Test, which has been used on various studies that examine the bilingual lexical access.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{organizations}} and institutions, most Mexican artisans are impoverished with little access to quality materials or designs, {{because of lack}} of cultural knowledge. Artisans also must compete with goods manufactured in large factories and copies of Mexican artesania imported from places like China. This keeps prices down, and <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> make authentic artesanía puts the Mexican craftsmen at an economic disadvantage. This is one reason why younger generations have less interest in the craft tradition.|$|E

25|$|The sight {{distance}} {{needed for a}} given situation is the distance travelled during the two phases of a driving maneuver: perception-reaction time (PRT), and maneuver time (MT). Perception-reaction time is {{the time it takes}} for a road user to realize that a reaction is needed to a road condition, decided what maneuver is appropriate, and start the maneuver. Maneuver time is <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> complete the maneuver. The distance driven during perception-reaction time and maneuver time is the {{sight distance}} needed.|$|E
25|$|Kepler's third law {{describes}} {{the motion of}} two bodies orbiting a common center of mass. It relates the orbital period (<b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> complete one full orbit) with {{the distance between the}} two bodies (the orbital separation), and the sum of their masses. For a given orbital separation, a higher total system mass implies higher orbital velocities. On the other hand, for a given system mass, a longer orbital period implies a larger separation and lower orbital velocities.|$|E
25|$|Scaling of {{distances}} (including {{sizes of}} bodies, {{while keeping the}} densities the same) gives similar orbits without scaling the time: if for example distances are halved, masses are divided by 8, gravitational forces by 16 and gravitational accelerations by 2. Hence velocities are halved and orbital periods remain the same. Similarly, when an object is dropped from a tower, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> {{fall to the ground}} remains the same with a scale model of the tower on a scale model of the Earth.|$|E
