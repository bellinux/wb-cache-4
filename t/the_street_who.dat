5|$|Nora Belahcen Fitzgerald first {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} of creating an organization to help Morocco's underprivileged women through career training in 2006 after meeting a single mother begging on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>who</b> lived on 2030 dirhams per day (about €2.70, $3.40 in 2006). Belahcen Fitzgerald was inspired by the Association Solidarité Féminine, which helps single mothers overcome poverty and social stigma by providing them with shelter, counselling, and vocational training. She decided to begin helping women by teaching them to make baked goods in her family's language center. This proved to be successful, and the participants were able to make more money using their new skills than by begging. In 2008, Belahcen Fitzgerald began hiring underprivileged Moroccan women to cook for events she organized for her friends.|$|E

2500|$|During World War II, Ohio State {{was one of}} the few colleges able {{to field}} a marching band for every home game. The band was able to field 100 to 120 musicians {{throughout}} the war.

The Marching Band was no longer an eligible activity, and in 1952, the Marching Band officially ended ties with the ROTC department. Cadets in the band could continue to try out and participate in band, but they would no longer receive ROTC credit.
