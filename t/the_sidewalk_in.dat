5|$|Sarria {{was honored}} in 2005 with the San Francisco LGBT Pride Celebration Committee's Lifetime Achievement Grand Marshal Award. On May 25, 2006, Sarria's {{lifetime}} of activism was commemorated {{when the city}} of San Francisco renamed a section of 16th Street in the Castro to José Sarria Court. A plaque outlining Sarria's accomplishments is embedded in <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of the Harvey Milk Memorial Branch of the San Francisco Public Library, which is located at 1 José Sarria Court.|$|E
5|$|When Milk's friends {{looked in}} his closet for a suit for his casket, they learned how much he had been {{affected}} by the recent decrease in his income as a supervisor. All of his clothes were coming apart; all of his socks had holes. He was cremated and his ashes were split, most of them scattered in San Francisco Bay by his closest friends. Some of them were encapsulated and buried beneath <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of 575 Castro Street, where Castro Camera had been located. There is a memorial to Milk also at Neptune Society Columbarium, ground floor, San Francisco, California. Harry Britt, one of four people Milk listed on his tape as an acceptable replacement should he be assassinated, was chosen to fill that position by the city's acting mayor, Dianne Feinstein.|$|E

25|$|Bates also {{sponsored}} and {{campaigned for}} {{the passage of}} Measure S in 2012, a sit-and-lie ordinance which would have made sitting on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> certain commercial districts illegal and subject to citation and/or arrest depending on number of repeated violations. Bates and Measure S supporters unsuccessfully argued that threatening legal sanction would encourage persistently homeless individuals to access social services.|$|E

50|$|The bridge {{originally}} had standard metal panels along <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1990s, they were replaced with new railings, {{but these were}} replaced again with metal lattice railings in the mid-1990s {{through the efforts of}} Edith Gilbert.|$|R
50|$|Some laws {{prohibit}} bicycle {{riding in}} commercial areas, such as on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> front of stores. In other places a sign erected {{by a government}} must be followed, such as with no-riding zones in a college campus.|$|R
25|$|On May 14, 2008 Markham-Cousins {{sent letters}} to {{students}} and family members explaining {{the reasons for the}} Fresh Start. She cited graduation rates and college preparation as two reasons why the program had to go forward. The same day, students staged a walk-out in protest of the program. Student drew with chalk on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of the school in support of the teachers.|$|E
25|$|Half of Flint's {{fourteen}} tallest {{buildings were}} built during the 1920s. The 19-story Genesee Towers, formerly the city's tallest building, {{was completed in}} 1968. The building became unused in later years and fell into severe disrepair: a cautionary sign warning of falling debris was put on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of it. An investment company purchased the building for $1, and it was demolished (by implosion) on December 22, 2013.|$|E
25|$|The narrow axis of {{the plan}} faces {{the street to the}} east, and the main {{entrance}} lies midway along the long side of the plan. The use of hip roofs includes a very large cantilevered hip roof over the living room terrace. The pitch of the main hip roof is shallow enough to give the passer-by on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of the house the impression that it is a flat roof.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} several pedestrian-only trails that travel between various parks and roadways. Hiking along these trails, {{as well as}} on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> Signal Hill is very popular. Some {{sections}} can be found that are between a 15% and 25% grade.|$|R
25|$|The west facade {{consisted}} of a glass curtain wall which sloped slightly inward. The facade projected outward (imitating bays and turrets) at points, and at points it featured a gabled roof. On the south corner of the building, a circular street plaza sliced into <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> the west (providing a few parking spaces) while cutting an arc into {{the facade of the}} building. This helped create a transition from the flat southern facade to the more diverse western facade.|$|E
25|$|Through the {{combined}} efforts of two Phoenix philanthropists, Walter Bimson and Lewis Ruskin, Waddell received a commission in 1970 {{to create a}} major work for downtown Phoenix. When completed in 1974, Dance consisted of eleven life-sized figures in various dance positions and another figure playing the flute. Although the piece has been moved from its original location in the Phoenix Civic Plaza to <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of the Herberger Theater, it remains Waddell’s tour de force in his adopted home of Arizona.|$|E
25|$|On March 6, 1978, {{during a}} legal battle related to {{obscenity}} in Gwinnett County, Georgia, Flynt and his local lawyer, Gene Reeves Jr., were returning to the courthouse when they were shot on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of 136 South Perry Street in Lawrenceville by a sniper standing near an alley across the street. The shooting left Flynt partially paralyzed with permanent spinal cord damage, {{and in need of}} a wheelchair. Flynt's injuries caused him constant, excruciating pain and he was addicted to painkillers until multiple surgeries deadened the affected nerves. He also suffered a stroke caused by one of several overdoses of his analgesic medications. He recovered but has had pronunciation difficulties since.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{people moved}} to Portland {{following}} the fair, {{which is why}} many houses around Portland {{were built in the}} years that followed. [...] There were also many street paving and <b>sidewalk</b> projects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years that followed the fair, and many of <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> Portland (East Portland especially) are dated from 1910 to 1920.|$|R
50|$|At first {{pedestrians}} climbed ladders to go between {{street level}} and <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> building entrances. Brick archways were constructed {{next to the}} road surface, above <b>the</b> submerged <b>sidewalks.</b> Skylights with small panes of clear glass (which later became amethyst-colored because of manganese in the glass) were installed, creating the area now called the Seattle Underground.|$|R
25|$|KSTP-TV's {{studios and}} offices are located at 3415 University Avenue, {{precisely}} on the Minneapolis-St. Paul boundary. <b>The</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> the adjacent {{photo of the}} building is on the city line. The principal production facilities, including the news studio, are on the Minneapolis side of the building. However, the business and advertising offices are on the St. Paul side. The station utilizes a St. Paul mailing address (55114-2099) as a result. The large tripod transmitting tower behind the station has one leg in each city, with the third leg precisely on {{the city and county}} line. This tower is primarily used to relay the station's signal to the Telefarm paired tower setup in Shoreview (shared with KSTP-FM, WCCO-TV, KARE, and WUCW). The tower also houses the transmitter for KEC65, the NOAA Weather Radio station serving the Twin Cities area.|$|E

500|$|In July 1937, the Williams and McNeil {{families}} {{opened a}} boarding house on South Perry Street in downtown Montgomery. It {{was at this}} time that Williams decided to change his name informally from Hiram to Hank, a name he said was better suited to his desired career in country music. During the same year he participated in a talent show at the Empire Theater. He won the first prize of $15, singing his first original song [...] "WPA Blues". Williams wrote the lyrics and used the tune of Riley Puckett's [...] "Dissatisfied." [...] He never learned to read music and, {{for the rest of his}} career, based his compositions in storytelling. After school and on weekends Williams sang and played his Silvertone guitar on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of the WSFA radio studios. His recent win at the Empire Theater and the street performances caught the attention of WSFA producers who occasionally invited him to perform on air. So many listeners contacted the radio station asking for more of [...] "the singing kid" [...] that the producers hired him to host his own 15-minute show twice a week for a weekly salary of US$15 (equivalent to US$0 in [...] ).|$|E
50|$|Chosewood Park is {{the pilot}} site for Edible Neighborhood. In February 2013 two dozen fruit and nut trees were planted along <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> of Chosewood Park. This was the {{beginning}} of the pilot project. The trees were followed by hundreds of edible flowers planted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> strips. <b>In</b> March 2013 three dozen herbs were planted: rosemary, oregano, thyme. All planted along <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> and curbsides of Chosewood, available to everyone to take a snip for cooking. The following winter saw the planting of blueberries, raspberries, grapes, and figs along <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks.</b> <b>In</b> February of 2017 another planting of 2 dozen apple, plum, pear, persimmon, and fig trees was provided for all neighbors who want to host a fruit tree for the neighborhood.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} stage, <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> steel bridge area were replaced. Also the {{existing}} 1.00 m high aluminum railings without ropes were replaced with 1.20 m high steel railings with ropes {{in order to}} satisfy current safety codes. The old rubber seals on the expansion joints were also replaced.|$|R

2500|$|Musician Jack Kelson {{recalled}} <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> {{front of}} the Dunbar as the most desirable place to hang out on the city's coolest street. He said, [...] "That's my favorite spot on Central Avenue, that spot in the {{front of the}} Dunbar Hotel, because that to me was the hippest, most intimate, key spot of all the activity. [...] That's where all the night people hung out: the sportsmen, the businessmen, the dancers, everybody in show business, people who were somebody stayed at the hotel. … y far that block, that Dunbar Hotel, for me was it. [...] And it was it for, it seemed to me, everybody else. [...] Sooner or later you walked in front of that hotel, and that's where everybody congregated." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{pedestrian}} scramble {{may be used}} {{where large}} numbers of pedestrians are expected, and they will also have enough space to gather on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> larger numbers. Under certain circumstances, pedestrian scrambles could reduce safety, as the average waiting times for pedestrians and car drivers are increased, thus creating more likelihood of people disobeying the signals.|$|R
