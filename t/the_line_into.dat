5|$|A second KKS {{line was}} opened on 27 March 1900, from Nybrua, {{located on the}} KSS's Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, via Trondheimsveien to Rodeløkka. Named the Rodeløkka Line, the {{southern}} section would later {{become part of the}} Sinsen Line. From Nybrua to the city centre, KSS track was used. The depot was located at Rodeløkka. A third line opened on 28 August 1900, from Tollbugaten in the city centre southwards to Festningsbryggen at Vippetangen—the Vippetangen Line. Again, KSS track was needed to connect <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>into</b> the city centre. Twenty cars and twelve trailers were bought from Busch with electric components delivered from Schuk—stock that remained in service until 1967. The company failed to make any profits, and was sold to KSS in 1905.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s and 1980s {{decaying}} {{infrastructure and}} {{the withdrawal of}} subsidies brought the future of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>into</b> doubt. As one of its last acts the Greater London Council paid for the replacement of two bridges on the line, allowing operations to continue. The centenary of the line in 1989 saw a renewal of interest and an upgrading of the trains between Chalfont& Latimer and London Marylebone station made commuting more practical, and usage of the line stabilised. The introduction of London Underground S Stock in 2010 led to {{the replacement of the}} shuttle service with half-hourly through trains to and from London.|$|E
5|$|Public {{transport}} in Shaw and Crompton is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester. Shaw and Crompton had {{a railway}} line and station between 1863 and 2009, opened initially for haulage, but later used for passenger and commuter journeys. Shaw and Crompton railway station {{was used by}} passenger trains running between Rochdale and Manchester on the Oldham Loop Line. After initially being rejected in the early 2000s, plans to turn <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>into</b> part of the light-rail Metrolink system were accepted by the government on 6 July 2006. Shaw and Crompton railway station closed on 3 October 2009, {{so that it can}} be converted from use with heavy rail to Metrolink. Shaw and Crompton Metrolink station opened on 16 December 2012.|$|E

5|$|Lewis died in 1893, and in {{the next}} decade the DL built no new lines. However, a group of investors bought the company, {{including}} the Dayton terminal property, in 1901 for $250,000 from Lewis's heirs. The first segment of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>into</b> downtown Dayton was completed in late 1902, branching off the main line at Hempstead and ending at Lambeth, site of the Dayton State Hospital. Unable to obtain a franchise from Dayton, and still unprofitable, the DL entered receivership in January 1905, and was sold at foreclosure in April 1907 and reorganized in May as the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad and Terminal Company. The bondholders who had organized the new company succeeded in obtaining the franchise, and sold the stock to a new group of investors in January 1909. Construction was restarted in April, and in November the branch reached the intersection of Brown and Caldwell Streets and the National Cash Register plant. Finally, after completing the cuts and fills required along the east bank of the Great Miami River, the DL opened its new main line in 1912, to a passenger depot {{on the north side of}} Washington Street, several blocks south and west of the city's main Union Station. A freight depot was located just to the north, at Eaker Street, and just beyond was an interchange track (not part of the original line) connecting to the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (B system) and, via that line, the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Panhandle Route, part of the Pennsylvania system).|$|E

25|$|Speculative {{residential}} development encouraged {{the construction of}} a line to Barnton, west of Edinburgh. The branch line opened on 1 March 1894; the terminus was named Cramond Brig at first.

25|$|In December 2015 {{new federal}} {{legislation}} was introduced allowing Amtrak {{to operate the}} NEC as a financially separate entity, thus able to re-invest profits from <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>into</b> new infrastructure. The legislation also provided for more low interest loans through changes in the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing and Capital Investment Grant (New Starts) federal funding programs. In March 2016, Amtrak and PANYNJ committed $35 million each for design and engineering work. Additional funding has not been identified.|$|E

The blue squadron in the French van was commanded by Châteaurenault; Victor-Marie d'Estrées commanded the rear white and blue squadron.

25|$|In 1940, the City of New York {{purchased}} the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, and began integrating <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>into</b> the system. The railroad {{north of the}} city line to White Plains and Port Chester was quickly dismantled. The section below East 180th Street to Greens Farm Junction was once used to interchange with the New Haven (and later Penn Central and Conrail) to bring subway cars and other equipment on and off the system. That section has since been removed, isolating this part of the subway from the interchange.|$|E
25|$|One can {{visualize}} this {{by drawing}} the n samples on a line, which divides <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>into</b> nnbsp&+nbsp&1 sections (nnbsp&minus&nbsp&1 segments between samples, and 2 intervals going to infinity at both ends), and noting that X'n+1 has an equal chance of landing {{in any of}} these nnbsp&+nbsp&1 sections. Thus one can also pick any k of these sections and give a k/(nnbsp&+nbsp&1) prediction interval (or set, if the sections are not consecutive). For instance, if nnbsp&=nbsp&2, then the probability that X3 will land between the existing two observations isnbsp&1/3.|$|E
25|$|From the outset, {{the rival}} Glasgow and South Western Railway had {{intended}} to build an independent line to Carlisle from Gretna, but this was forbidden by Parliament during the authorisation process. The G was required to make a junction with the Caledonian main line at Gretna Junction, and to run over <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>into</b> Carlisle. That arrangement started in 1850, and the former G still operates, making the connection at Gretna Junction as before. All the other branches referred to in this section have closed, {{with the exception of}} the Lanark branch.|$|E
