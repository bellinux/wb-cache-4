40|$|A {{distributed}} {{online learning}} framework for support vector machines (SVMs) is presented and analyzed. First, the generic binary classification problem is decomposed into multiple relaxed subproblems.

This computation can be performed by individual processing units, such as separate computers or processor cores, in parallel and possibly having access to only {{a subset of the}} data. Convergence properties of continuous- and discrete-time variants of the proposed parallel update schemes are studied. A sufficient condition is derived under which synchronous and asynchronous gradient algorithms converge to the approximate solution. Subsequently, a class of stochastic update algorithms, which may arise due to distortions in the information flow between units, is shown to be globally stable under similar sufficient conditions. Active set methods are utilized <b>to</b> <b>decrea</b> se communication and computational overhead.

In functional assays on cell lines, association of SATB 1 with tumour cell behaviour was investigated. Results: Nuclear expression of SATB 1 was seen in 17. 8 % of the cancers.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purposes}} of this study were to understand the general hospital nurses' work stress, burn out and turnover intention and to identify the factors that influence on turnover intention. Methods: This study was conducted through a survey of 283 nurses having at least 6 months of work experience of 4 general hospitals in Seoul. Data were collected from September to October 2009. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and stepwise multiple regression test with SPSS WIN 14. 0. Results: The score for turnover intention was 3. 57 out of 5. Turnover intention was significantly correlated with work stress, burn out, and working position. The factors influencing turnover intention were organizational system, depersonalization, physical environment, work position, and occupational climate. The predict variables accounted for 27. 9 % of turnover intention. Conclusion: The results of this study show that factors influencing turnover intention are organizational system, depersonalization, physical environment, work position, and organizational climate. Therefore, nursing managers should understand the organization's climate and establish a reasonable organization system <b>to</b> <b>decreas...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} to {{identify}} the relationship among clinical nurse's job overload, self-efficacy, emotional exhaust and turnover intention. Methods: The study was conducted through a survey on 537 clinical nurses in five general hospitals. The data were collected by self-reporting questionnaires and analysed by the SPSS/WIN 17. 0 program using descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson correlation coefficient and stepwise multiple regression. Results: The mean score of turnover intention was 3. 04. Turnover intention according to age, total career, job objective, and work off showed significant differences. The significant positive correlations between emotional exhaust and turnover intention (r=. 531, p<. 001), job overload and turnover intention (r=. 514, p<. 001) were found. The significant factors influencing turnover intention were emotional exhaust (β=. 488, p<. 001), ca-reer (β=. 175, p<. 001), job overload (β=. 119, p =. 003), and number of night (β=. 117, p =. 002), which accounted for 40. 3 % of the variance. Conclusion: Thought this result, nursing managers should analyze the reasons for high turnover intention, focusing on the main factors affecting turnover intention and consider the solutions <b>to</b> <b>decreas...</b>|$|E
40|$|Approximately {{half of all}} HER 2 /neu-overexpressing {{breast cancer}} {{patients}} {{do not respond to}} trastuzumab-containing therapy. Therefore, there remains an urgent and unmet clinical need for the development of predictive biomarkers for trastuzumab response. Recently, several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the inflammatory tumor microenvironment is a major contributor to therapy resistance in breast cancer. In order to explore the predictive value of inflammation in breast cancer patients, we measured the inflammatory biomarkers serum ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) in 66 patients immediately before undergoing trastuzumab-containing therapy and evaluated their progression-free and overall survival. The elevation in pre-treatment serum ferritin (. 250 ng/ml) or CRP (. 7. 25 mg/l) {{was a significant predictor of}} reduced progression-free survival and shorter overall survival. When patients were stratified based on their serum ferritin and CRP levels, patients with elevation in both inflammatory biomarkers had a markedly poorer response to trastuzumab-containing therapy. Therefore, the elevation in inflammatory serum biomarkers may reflect a pathological state that decreases the clinical efficacy of this therapy.
