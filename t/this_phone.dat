2500|$|Goodfellas {{is based}} on New York crime {{reporter}} Nicholas Pileggi's book Wiseguy. Martin Scorsese {{did not intend to}} make another mob film until he saw a review of Pileggi's book, which he then read while working on the set of Color of Money in 1986. He had always been fascinated by the Mob lifestyle and was drawn to Pileggi's book because it was the most honest portrayal of gangsters he had ever read. After reading Pileggi's book, the filmmaker knew what approach he wanted to take: [...] "To begin Goodfellas like a gunshot and have it get faster from there, almost like a two-and-a-half-hour trailer. I think it's {{the only way you can}} really sense the exhilaration of the lifestyle, and to get a sense of why a lot of people are attracted to it." [...] According to Pileggi, Scorsese cold-called the writer and told him, [...] "I've been waiting for this book my entire life", to which Pileggi replied, [...] "I've been waiting for <b>this</b> <b>phone</b> call my entire life".|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} custom ROM images {{exist for the}} P500, notably Cyanogenmod 7.2 [...] First Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) Images are {{available}} at xda-developers, yet these still have video playback performance issues due to missing libraries for hardware assisted decoding. It is also possible to run Android 4.4.1 (KitKat) on <b>this</b> <b>phone.</b> LG has released two different Baseband driver versions, the one {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "old baseband" [...] was shipped with the official Android 2.2 ROM images, while the [...] "new baseband" [...] is shipped with the official Android 2.3 ROMs. Depending on the custom ROM one wants to use, the matching baseband has to be installed on the device (for instance the official Cyanogenmod 7.2 ROM-Image uses the new baseband, the unofficial Cyanogenmod 7.1 Image requires the old one). The easiest way to change between baseband versions is to install the corresponding official firmware. To be able to install custom ROM images one has to get root access to the phone, voiding warranty in the process. The Android 2.2 firmware shipped by LG suffers a severe security vulnerability that can be exploited for this purpose by an app named Gingerbreak. On the official Android 2.3 ROM images rooting by an Android App does not seem to work, yet with a PC connected by USB, SuperOneClick and the Android Debug Bridge one can get root access as well. The easiest way to install a custom ROM from the SD-Card is to flash it through ClockworkMod recovery.|$|E
