5|$|From 1933 to 1946, Branham was {{the pastor}} of the Branham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville. He also moonlighted as a game warden during this <b>time</b> <b>because</b> his {{pastoral}} salary did no meet his financial needs.|$|E
5|$|He died on March 29, 1829. He {{was taken}} to the {{cemetery}} by his sons. There was no state funeral at the <b>time,</b> <b>because</b> Juan Lavalle made a coup against the governor Manuel Dorrego and executed him, starting a period of civil war. Lavalle was defeated by Juan Manuel de Rosas, who was appointed governor. Once he restored peace, Rosas made a state funeral for Saavedra, on January 13, 1830.|$|E
5|$|I Bonaparte {{chose to}} ride across the alps on a mule (obtained at a convent at Martigny) {{rather than a}} steed, the typical gentleman's mount at the <b>time,</b> <b>because</b> the mule was {{considered}} to be more sure-footed on the slippery slopes and narrow passes of the Alps, and to be more sturdy and hardy while making such a perilous journey on such volatile terrain.|$|E

5|$|On 15 August 2008, 1FLTV, {{licensed}} by Liechtenstein's Government, {{became the first}} broadcaster based in Liechtenstein. This would allow the country to begin competing at the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time, should they decide to join the EBU, a pre-requisite for entering the contest. Shortly after its foundation however, the broadcaster announced {{that they were not}} interested in joining the EBU or Eurovision at that <b>time</b> <b>because</b> they had no budget for membership.|$|E
5|$|Since the Victorian era the Thames {{has been}} {{extensively}} embanked, {{and many of its}} London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding. The threat has increased over <b>time</b> <b>because</b> of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-glacial rebound.|$|E
5|$|The Tyrian shekel weighed four Athenian drachmas, about 14grams, {{more than}} earlier 11-gram Israeli shekels, but was {{regarded}} as the equivalent for religious duties at that <b>time.</b> <b>Because</b> Roman coinage was only 80% silver, the purer (94% or more) Tyrian shekels were required to pay the temple tax in Jerusalem. The money changers referenced in the New Testament Gospels (Matt. 21:12 and parallels) exchanged Tyrian shekels for common Roman currency.|$|E

5|$|The convoy, {{moving at}} , was not {{detected}} for some <b>time,</b> <b>because</b> of two tropical storms that struck the Solomon and Bismarck Seas between 27 February and 1 March, but at about 15:00 on 1 March, {{the crew of}} a patrolling B-24 Liberator heavy bomber spotted the convoy. Eight B-17 Flying Fortresses {{were sent to the}} location but failed to locate the ships.|$|E
5|$|The gaps are {{not seen}} in a simple {{snapshot}} of {{the locations of the}} asteroids at any one <b>time</b> <b>because</b> asteroid orbits are elliptical, and many asteroids still cross through the radii corresponding to the gaps. The actual spatial density of asteroids in these gaps does not differ significantly from the neighboring regions.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{scheduled}} to be completed by May 16, 2016, but the estimated completion date was pushed back to October 2016. In October 2016, concerns arose that the station might not open on <b>time</b> <b>because</b> workers had only installed 10 of the station's 13 escalators. However, the 86th Street station passed all required systems testing by December 18, 2016. The station opened on January 1, 2017.|$|E

5|$|This type of {{profile is}} common for dives at sites {{where there is a}} flat sea-bed or where the diver remains at the same place {{throughout}} the dive to work. It is the most demanding profile for decompression for a given maximum depth and <b>time</b> <b>because</b> inert gas absorption continues at maximum rate for most of the dive. Decompression tables are drawn up {{based on the assumption that}} the diver may follow a square profile.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} genetically {{discrete}} subpopulations {{have been identified}} across the northern range of the Pacific angelshark. Several subpopulations exist along the coast from Point Conception northward to Alaska. In the Southern California Bight, {{there are at least}} three separate subpopulations off the mainland and northern and southern Channel Islands. The subpopulation along the Pacific coast of Baja California are distinct from those in the Gulf of California. These subpopulations have diverged from one another over <b>time</b> <b>because</b> Pacific angelsharks do not undertake long migratory movements outside of their preferred home areas, and deep waters serve as effective geographical barriers to population mixing. Heterozygosity, a measure of genetic diversity, is higher in the Pacific angelshark than in other shark species that have been examined.|$|E

5|$|A worm whose ruleset {{begins with}} 0 {{continues}} {{in a straight line}} forever. This is a trivial case, so it is usually stipulated that the worm must turn when it encounters a point with only uneaten gridlines. Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image symmetrical duplicates, the worm's first turn must be a right hand turn. A worm dies if it returns to its origin a third <b>time,</b> <b>because</b> there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm.|$|E
5|$|According to the Augustan History, Odaenathus {{was assassinated}} by a cousin named Maeonius. In Augustan History, Odaenathus' son {{from his first}} wife was named Herodes and was crowned co-ruler by his father. The Augustan History claims that Zenobia conspired with Maeonius for a <b>time</b> <b>because</b> she did not accept her stepson as his father's heir (ahead of her own children). The Augustan History does not suggest that Zenobia was {{involved}} in the events leading to her husband's murder, and the crime is attributed to Maeonius' moral degeneration and jealousy. This account, according to historian Alaric Watson, can be dismissed as fictional. Although some modern scholarship suggests that Zenobia {{was involved in the}} assassination due to political ambition and opposition to her husband's pro-Roman policy, she continued Odaenathus' policies during her first years on the throne.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of these}} disappointments, No. 6 Commando's first major {{action as a}} formed unit came in November 1942 when, along with No. 1 Commando, it formed part of the {{spearhead}} for the Allied landings in Algeria as part of Operation Torch. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Iain McAlpine, the commando embarked upon HMT Awatea in October 1942 in Glasgow along with some United States Army Rangers that were also {{taking part in the}} operation. Tensions were high between the British and the Vichy French at this <b>time</b> <b>because</b> of a number of clashes and as a result the decision was made for the commandos to be equipped with American weapons and uniforms in an effort to placate the defenders.|$|E

5|$|Because the Moon is {{continuously}} blocking {{our view}} of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky, the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view. In this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same <b>time.</b> <b>Because</b> of the precession of the lunar orbit, each year different stars are occulted.|$|E
5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} had a {{much harder}} <b>time,</b> <b>because</b> the country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay. The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E
5|$|Ericsson's revolutionary turret, {{although}} not without flaws, {{was a unique}} concept in gun mounting that was soon adapted and used on naval ships around the world. His Monitor design employed over forty patented inventions and was completely {{different from any other}} naval warship at the <b>time.</b> <b>Because</b> Monitor was an experimental craft, urgently needed, hurriedly constructed and almost immediately put to sea, a number of problems were discovered during her maiden voyage to Hampton Roads and during the battle there. Yet Monitor was still able to challenge Virginia and prevent her from further destroying the remaining ships in the Union flotilla blockading Hampton Roads.|$|E
