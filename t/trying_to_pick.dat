5|$|While {{the weather}} was fine, the wind whipped up {{to such an extent}} at pitch level that the ball was taken out of its proper flight on occasion. In the third minute Sheffield United were nearly a goal up after Arsenal goalkeeper Wilson dropped the ball to the ground and fumbled at it <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> it up. United players Barclay and Dodds both charged in to take advantage, but an Arsenal defender cleared the ball away before they could turn the {{opportunity}} into a goal. During the first fifteen minutes, United were the superior team with the work of their forwards only failing against the work of Arsenal's full backs and goalkeeper with Wilson continuing to looking not entirely safe. Arsenal's defenders eventually settled with Crayston and Copping stepping up for their team.|$|E
5|$|Just days later, Yankee {{right fielder}} Gary Sheffield's cap was knocked {{off by a}} Red Sox fan while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up a fair ball in right field during the 8th inning at Fenway Park. In response, Sheffield pushed the fan. The {{conflict}} was quickly stopped by security guards. The fan was not ejected from the game, although left the park voluntarily. Fan interference was not called and Sheffield's reaction resulted in a run scoring Triple for the Red Sox' Jason Varitek. It was the game-winning RBI. Contrary to most media reports, the fan is still a season ticket holder today. The season ended with both teams, already with guaranteed playoff berths, playing {{each other for the}} division crown {{on the last day of}} the season in a game that had the Yankees come out on top. Both teams wound up losing in the 2005 ALDS, the Yankees to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and the Red Sox to the eventual World Series champion that year, the Chicago White Sox.|$|E

25|$|Accusations and recriminations flew around. Some {{civilians were}} {{angry at the}} Germans, some at the British for abandoning them and many at other civilians for how they had behaved. Investigators turned up looking for war crimes. The bulk of civilians went looking for work, {{rebuilding}} their strength with the improved food and medicines now available and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up their lives {{after five years of}} occupation. There was also {{a lot of work to}} do repairing damaged houses.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the command}} of Captain Peter Nicol, Loch Sloy was on passage from Glasgow to Adelaide and Melbourne with a load of general cargo and seven passengers, {{including}} 2 women; David Kilpatrick, a cook from Glasgow (25), George Lamb, a clerk from Edinburgh, (30), Robert Logan, a piano tuner from Inverness, (40), Alexander McDonald, an engineer from Aberdeen (34), Captain Osmond Leicester (30) and Mrs Leicester (real name Blanche Sophia Meyer-Edmunds, 26, but listed as 30; Osmond's real wife Fermina had been abandoned) of Liverpool, and Rosalind Cartlidge (25). In {{the early hours of}} 24 April 1899, she met with disaster on the coast of Kangaroo Island {{at the mouth of the}} Investigator Strait, South Australia. The ship overran her distance when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up the light at Cape Borda. She was too close inshore and the light was hidden by the cliffs between Cape Bedout and Cape Couedie. In the darkness of the morning she ran full on to a reef 300 yards from shore to the north of the Casuarina Islets in Maurpetuis Bay.|$|E
25|$|The next {{match was}} the Tag Team Turmoil {{match for the}} World Tag Team Championship. Tajiri and William Regal were the champions heading into the match. The teams would come out at random, and it was The Heart Throbs who entered first, with the champions Tajiri and Regal coming out next. Tajiri {{utilized}} a lot of kicks and then locked in the Tarantula. The Heart Throbs then kept Tajiri isolated, but Tajiri pinned Antonio with a sunset flip. Simon Dean and Maven entered into the match next, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> apart the weakened Tajiri. Their inclusion in the match did not last very long as Regal made the tag and cleaned house, putting Dean away with a knee to the head. La Résistance came in next, but Regal and Tajiri tried to fight back. Regal was then rolled up, {{with a handful of}} tights, eliminating he and Tajiri and guaranteeing new champions. Rosey and The Hurricane were the last two men to enter the match. Hurricane was then smashed on the turnbuckle post. Hurricane and Rosey got the pin when Hurricane leapt off the shoulders of Rosey, who was perched on the top rope to grab the win.|$|E

The short version of the video is seven minutes and fifty-four seconds long and the full version is nine minutes and thirty-three seconds long. The video begins {{with a group of}} men <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up women, but failing. One of the men (Michael Jackson) is told to go home and not to hang around with the other guys anymore. When the man walks home, an elderly man (played by Joe Seneca), who is sitting on the steps of his house, tells him to just be himself. The man notices a woman, played by model/dancer Tatiana Thumbtzen, walking down the streets alone.|$|E
500|$|As well as {{the scale}} of the response, critics {{questioned}} the criteria against which patients were selected for evacuation. At first the UK was challenged over its decision to include only children in the transports while tens of thousands of adults remained wounded in the city. Sylvana Foa, spokesperson for the UNHCR, commented that Sarajevo should not be regarded as a [...] "supermarket" [...] of photogenic potential refugees, asking [...] "Does this mean Britain only wants to help children? Maybe it only wants children under six, or blond children, or blue-eyed children?" [...] Patrick Peillod, head of the United Nations medical evacuation committee, said that the UK had treated Bosnian children [...] "like animals in a zoo" [...] and was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> and choose evacuees to suit a public relations agenda. When the government revised its approach and included adults on flights out of the city, claims were made that wounded combatants had been among those taken to the UK, Sweden, and Italy, and that patients had paid bribes {{to be included in the}} transports.|$|E
500|$|Spencer Stone {{was born}} in 1992 in Sacramento, California, United States to Brian Stone and Joyce Eskel. He has an older brother named Everett, a California Highway Patrolman in Redwood City, California, and younger sister named Kelly. Growing up in Carmichael, California, Stone met his now-best friends Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler while {{attending}} Freedom Christian School in Fair Oaks, California, continuing their friendship into adulthood. All three men are described as sharing [...] "a deeply religious background and a belief in service to their community" [...] His mom stated {{that he wanted to}} become a soldier, watching countless Navy Seal videos with him. Stone later attended Del Campo High School where he played football, lacrosse, and other contact sports. Del Campo High School teacher and basketball coach Dave Nobis, remembers Stone as he played basketball in junior year through to senior year when he was also in Nobis' psychology class. Nobis said that Stone was always looking out for family and friends, [...] ""His blue-collar attitude and how he cared about others, he would have been the one to step up rather than curl into a ball." [...] and that [...] "He was always <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up his teammates, giving them a high five.

2500|$|McLaren's absence was {{formally}} registered at 4:00am (local time) and sparked a massive manhunt that drew in friendly forces {{from outside of}} the UK military sphere. McLaren's disappearance coincided with a visit to Afghanistan by the then British Prime Minister David Cameron. Cameron {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "throw everything you have got at <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up this young man", rather than being taken of a tour around the district.|$|E
2500|$|At about 9:30 PM, Patrolmen Thomas Smith and Ernest Rowell {{attempted}} to help Sgt. Sam Levy, who was pinned down by sniper fire near the car where he'd first been shot.

[...] "A big convention without 'Jimmy' Montague at the press table would seem scarcely legal," [...] the World magazine wrote in 1919. Montague also covered the 1924 conventions and election, which was notable for the split within the Democratic Party.

2500|$|The {{line had}} a good safety record: {{there was only one}} {{reported}} accident on the line. On 1 September 1897 at Tooth's Bank, 2 miles north of Heathfield, the 08:18am service from Eastbourne was running around 4 minutes late and was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up time in order to meet a connecting train at Groombridge. As the train entered the curve at around 40mph it left the tracks. Driver James McKinlay was killed and Fireman Lewis Minns seriously injured, whilst 30 passengers suffered minor injuries. At the subsequent inquiry, Lt. Col. G. W. Addison reported that the main cause of the accident was excessive speed as the driver was attempting to make up lost time {{in order to make a}} connection at [...] The track itself was in poor shape with many rotten sleepers and [...] "curves having irregular elevation" [...] which contributed to the accident. Following the inquiry, much of the track was relaid and the train scheduling was altered.|$|E
2500|$|Liz is {{generally}} portrayed {{as something of}} a [...] "geek". So, while she is an apparently skilled writer, she seems to have very few social skills (in [...] "Rosemary's Baby", Jack describes her as [...] "socially retarded"). For example, while she was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up men at a karaoke bar, a man asked her if the seat next to her was taken, leading her to ask him why she should have to move her coat just so he could sit there. Liz is often shown to be generally insecure and holds a strong concern for how she is perceived by others. Liz is sometimes dismissive of others, a personality flaw that can be connected to her lack of social skills. Assessing Liz's personality up to near the end of season 3, Jonah Weinerslav described her as [...] "an eternal 13-year-old tomboy—scared of sex, obsessed with Star Wars and meatball subs" [...] and as [...] "cling to a fantasy of presexual, junk-food-munching adolescence".|$|E
