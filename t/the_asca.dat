25|$|In 2012, the CSCORE {{assisted}} in evaluating and publishing six statewide research studies assessing {{the effectiveness of}} school counseling programs based on statewide systemic use of school counseling programs such as <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> National Model and their outcomes in Professional School Counseling. Research indicated strong correlational evidence between lower school counseling ratios and better student success academically, in terms of career and college access/readiness/admission, and for various personal/social issues including school safety, reduced disciplinary issues, and better attendance in schools with fully implemented school counseling programs.|$|E
40|$|Recently {{analysis}} of variance (ANOVA) -simultaneous component analysis (ASCA) has been introduced as an explorative tool for the {{analysis of}} multivariate data with an underlying experimental design [Smilde et al. Bioinformatics 2005; 21 : 3043 - 3048]. This paper focuses on the general methodological framework of <b>ASCA.</b> <b>The</b> drawbacks of other methods {{for the analysis of}} this type of data are discussed, as well as <b>the</b> advantages of <b>ASCA</b> above these other methods. Three case studies are used to illustrate <b>the</b> use of <b>ASCA.</b> <b>The</b> relationship between <b>ASCA</b> and several other multivariate data analysis techniques is demonstrated.

25|$|But school {{counseling}} in the 1980s and early 1990s was absent from educational reform efforts. The profession was facing irrelevance as the standards-based educational movement gained strength with {{little evidence of}} systemic effectiveness for school counselors. In response, consulted with elementary, middle, and high school counselors and created <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> Student Standards with three core domains (Academic, Career, Personal/Social), nine standards, and specific competencies and indicators for K-12 students. A year later, the first systemic meta-analysis of {{school counseling}} was published focused on outcome research in academic, career, and personal/social domains.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, most provinces {{have adapted}} K-12 {{comprehensive}} {{school counseling programs}} similar to those initiated by and adapted in <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> National Model. School counselors reported in 2004 {{at a conference in}} Winnipeg on issues such as budget cuts, lack of clarity about school counselor roles, high student to school counselor ratios, especially in elementary schools, and how using a comprehensive school counseling model helped to clarify school counselor roles with teachers and administrators and strengthen the profession. In 2009, The Canadian Counselling Association (CCA) became the Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association (CCPA). Three Canadian provinces require school counseling.|$|E
25|$|Coady, like Raiffeisen, Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch and Alphonse Desjardins {{was part}} of a global {{movement}} in co-operative microfinance. Due to the poor performance of many community-based credit unions in the developing world, this movement lost its momentum in the 1970s, to be replaced by the more centralized approach characteristic of the microcredit movement. However, the main successes in microcredit have been confined to urban or very densely populated rural areas. In recent years there has been a revival of interest in village-based and participatory approaches, such as the SHG movement in India and <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> movement in Africa {{to address the problem of}} financial services for poor rural farmers.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the American Kennel Club (AKC) is {{the primary}} {{registry}} for purebred dogs, and first recognized the Australian Shepherd in 1991 {{as a member of}} the Herding group. However, many Aussie breeders felt the AKC put too much emphasis on breed conformity and not enough on performance, so <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> declined to join the AKC. Those breeders who felt that AKC membership had its advantages split off from ASCA to form their own Australian Shepherd club, the United States Australian Shepherd Association, created their own breed standard, and joined the AKC in 1993. The decision about affiliation with the AKC remains controversial, as it does with many performance breeds.|$|E
25|$|A {{framework}} for appropriate and inappropriate school counselor responsibilities and roles is outlined in <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> National Model (Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005; ASCA, 2012). School counselors, in most USA states, {{usually have a}} master's degree in school counseling from a Counselor Education graduate program. In Canada, they must be licensed teachers with additional school counseling training and focus on academic, career, and personal/social issues. China requires {{at least three years}} of college experience. In Japan, school counselors were added in the mid-1990s, part-time, primarily focused on behavioral issues. In Taiwan, they are often teachers with recent legislation requiring school counseling licensure focused on individual and group counseling for academic, career, and personal issues. In Korea, school counselors are mandated in middle and high schools.|$|E

In the softest X-ray bands monitored by ROSAT (0. 1 ‚Äì 0. 4 keV, 0. 5 ‚Äì 1. 0 keV) the source flux remained constant throughout the observing period.

40|$|Baker‚Äôs/brewer‚Äôs yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{has been}} used as an {{alternative}} to antibiotic growth promoters to improve growth performance in animals. In humans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is among the most commonly detected fungi in fecal samples and likely originates from food. Recently, an association between anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and obesity in humans was suggested, but the cause of <b>the</b> elevated <b>ASCA</b> levels is not clear. Our aim was to study ASCA in morbidly obese subjects and explore potential associations with anthropometrics, diet, co-morbidities and biomarkers of inflammation and gut permeability. Methods Subjects with morbid obesity referred to a specialized hospital unit were included. Diet and clinical data were recorded with self-administered questionnaires. Main dietary sources of baker‚Äôs/brewer‚Äôs yeast (e. g. bread and beer) were used as a proxy for the intake of yeast. Laboratory analyses included ASCA, serum zonulin (reflecting gut permeability), C-reactive protein and a routine haematological and biochemical screening. Results One-hundred-and-forty subjects; 109 (78 %) female, 98 with dietary records, mean age 43 years and BMI 42 kg/m 2 were included. <b>The</b> number of <b>ASCA</b> positive subjects was 31 (22 %) for IgG, 4 (2. 9 %) for IgA and 3 (2. 1 %) for IgM. Age, body fat mass and C-reactive protein were significantly higher in IgG-positive compared to IgG-negative subjects (P < 0. 05). A borderline significant association was found between elevated zonulin and ASCA IgG-positivity (P = 0. 06). No association was found between yeast-containing food and ASCA IgG-positivity, or between yeast-containing food and fat mass. Conclusions The findings indicate that ASCA IgG-positivity may be linked to the generalized inflammation commonly seen with increased adiposity, but not to dietary yeast intake. Other potential causes for <b>the</b> raised <b>ASCA</b> IgG concentrations, such as genetic predisposition, deviations in the gut microbiota and cross-reactivity of ASCA with other antigens, were not explored...|$|R
