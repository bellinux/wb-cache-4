25|$|After {{ascending}} to {{the presidency}} in 1977, Carter named Strauss as U.S. Trade Representative. The position enjoyed cabinet level status, while allowing Strauss to apply his considerable negotiating skills to America's troubled relations with its trading partners. As Trade Representative, Strauss successfully completed the <b>Tokyo</b> <b>Round</b> of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, and secured the agreement's ratification by the US Congress in the Trade Act of 1979. Then, Carter asked Strauss to undertake an even more challenging task, as his Personal Representative to the Middle East. Carter's previous efforts had already resulted in the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, and Carter hoped that Strauss {{would be able to}} build on the success. The handshake of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Al Sadat on the White House lawn was a high point of Carter's presidency, but dark clouds were gathering on the horizon.|$|E
2500|$|Seven {{rounds of}} {{negotiations}} occurred under GATT. The first real GATT trade rounds concentrated on further reducing tariffs. Then, the Kennedy Round in the mid-sixties {{brought about a}} GATT anti-dumping Agreement and a section on development. The <b>Tokyo</b> <b>Round</b> during the seventies {{was the first major}} attempt to tackle trade barriers that do not take the form of tariffs, and to improve the system, adopting a series of agreements on non-tariff barriers, which in some cases interpreted existing GATT rules, and in others broke entirely new ground. Because these plurilateral agreements were not accepted by the full GATT membership, they were often informally called [...] "codes". Several of these codes were amended in the Uruguay Round, and turned into multilateral commitments accepted by all WTO members. Only four remained plurilateral (those on government procurement, bovine meat, civil aircraft and dairy products), but in 1997 WTO members agreed to terminate the bovine meat and dairy agreements, leaving only two. Despite attempts in the mid-1950s and 1960s to create some form of institutional mechanism for international trade, the GATT continued to operate for almost half a century as a semi-institutionalized multilateral treaty regime on a provisional basis.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} tariff phase-outs in multilateral and preferential agreements. The paper {{finds that}} early GATT rounds primarily were over bindings of existing rates {{and that it}} was not until the 1962 - 67 Kennedy Round's 50 % reduction in manufactured goods tariffs that time paths of tariff reductions became a substantive part of GATT agreements. Existing empirical work has demonstrated that U. S. industries with high initial tariffs tended to receive long periods for tariff adjustment or tended to be exempted from agreed reductions in both the Kennedy and <b>Tokyo</b> <b>Rounds.</b> This paper demonstrates that high U. S. tariffs and little intra-industry trade are associated with long NAFTA phase-out periods for U. S. imports from Mexico. Mexico's phase-outs are correlated, on the other hand, with those of the United States but not generally with Mexico's tariffs. ...|$|R

40|$|Increasingly {{throughout}} the 1970 's and 80 's protectionist external-trade policies have proliferated {{in both the}} advanced and developing worlds. This new protectionism {{has been attributed to}} a variety of causes: the world recession, intensified by the two oil crises of 1973 and 1979; to the emergence of new economic powers, mainly Japan and other Asian countries; to technological change; and to the introduction of a floating exchange rate regime. More accurately it should be described as renewed protectionism. During the period 1950 to 1970 the most obvious symptoms of protectionism subsided, but by no means disappeared, and {{the last decade or so}} has seen a reversal of this trend. Nonetheless, the tariff reductions painfully negotiated under the aegis of the Kennedy and <b>Tokyo</b> <b>Rounds</b> have been retained, so resort to non-tariff barriers has been greater.

40|$|International trade {{relations}} between {{developed and developing}} countries have been accommodated by means of multilateral trade negotiations. These negotiations ensured the birth of GATT in 1948. GATT has eight rounds of trade negotiations. The last one is the Uruguay Round (1986 - 1994). The principle of reciprocity of obligation (MFN) is well established in these trade rounds, {{as it is a}} central principle in traditional international trade law. This principle has negative effect on developing countriesand prejudice their interests. Developing countries made claims against this classical concept. They argued that the {{trade relations}}need a remedy to ensure their development and trade needs. A suitable solution to this critical issue is to grant special status and treatmentto countries at lower stages of development. This thesis contains five chapters. The method adopted in it is a historical, analytical and a critical approach. Chapter one deals with Uruguay Round and the establishment of WTO as a result of multilateral trade negotiations. It gives a historical background to all rounds before Uruguay Round. The study goes further to explain issues dealt with during the Uruguay Round. These include trade in goods, services and IPRs. The chapter also defines WTO and deals with categorization of WTO members. WTO recognizes four groups of members: developed, developing, least- developed countries and transitional economics. However, it defines one category (LDCs) as it is recognized by UN system. Moreover, the chapter deals with the notion of special and differential treatment in international trade law as an exception to the general rule of reciprocity. It explains developing countries’ efforts to express their views and legitimize their development and trade needs through the concept of special and differential treatment. These efforts institutionalized the concept in a number of amendments and decisions to the original GATT. WTO Agreements contain also about 145 provisions. Chapter two deals with special and differential treatment in pre- Uruguay Round. The main fields thathad this principle are Articles XVIII, Part IV, <b>Tokyo</b> <b>Rounds</b> Codes and the enabling clause. Chapter three explains the main provisions on special and differential treatment in WTO Agreements. They include provisions to enhance opportunities for developing countries to access markets of developed countries; safeguard developing countries’ interests by adopting national or international measures; provide longer transitional periods; and grant technical and financial assistance. Chapter four explains implementation of provisions on special and differential treatment. It focuses on difficulties that faced developing countries and prevented them from gaining the benefits of special and differential treatment under WTO Agreements. Chapter five deals with conclusion and recommendations for the concept of special and differential treatment in WTO Agreements. It suggests proposals to solve problems that have been facing developing countries and provides recommendationsto be observed in the future WTO negotiations...|$|R

40|$|In {{multilateral}} trade negotiations, trade-offs {{usually are}} made within the issue-areas {{that are on}} the agenda. In the absence of cross-issue trade-offs (linkages), agreement may not be possible. To maximize both the potential gains from trade and the scope for agreement, negotiators need to be willing and able to consider the feasibility of issue linkages. This raises the practical problem of determining when such trade-offs are likely to be necessary. Although quantitative methods of policy analysis have been developed, they have not been widely used by policymakers, in part owing to the fact that negotiations focus largely on nontariff measures. This article proposes a qualitative approach to the problem and applies it to the <b>Tokyo</b> and Uruguay <b>Round</b> negotiations on safeguards to protect domestic industries from problems related to increases in import...|$|R
40|$|From 1975 through 1993, five US presidents {{were granted}} {{fast-track}} trade negotiating authority by the Congress. This authority has {{enabled them to}} submit legislation implementing trade agreements to Congress under procedures that assure an up-or-down vote, without amendments, within a limited time period. Congress sets guidelines for the substance of negotiations and requires notification and consultation at key stages. The assurance of prompt congressional action on the results {{makes it possible for}} US trade negotiators to speak credibly for the United States. The fast track procedure has proved a remarkable success, making possible the completion of four major trade agreements: the multilateral <b>Tokyo</b> and Uruguay <b>Rounds,</b> the Free Trade Agreement with Canada, and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In 1994, however, this authority lapsed, and President Bill Clinton has lacked the ability to deliver on trade-negotiating commitments such as the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). Congress is expected to consider his specific fast-track renewal proposal this coming fall. In this timely analysis, Destler analyzes experience with fast-track procedures since their enactment. He comes out strongly in favor of fast-track renewal but argues for changes in the process to curb abuses and ensure that Congress retains the ability to decide on major new trade liberalizing initiatives. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} {{achievements of}} peoples bear {{a close relationship}} with their cultures and level of development of their civilization. Until the 16 th century, the major world civilizations were similar in stage of development in being feudalistic, authoritarian and religious. Since then with the Enlightenment, the age of Reason and the control of nature through mastery of science, Western civilization has taken a quantum leap in creating the modern industrial world and achieved wealth through colonization and globalization. In stagnating for centuries, Asians paid dearly at the feet of Western hegemony. Nevertheless, through the embrace of techno-science whilst retaining traditional values, Asians are now catching up fast. East Asians have happily discovered that practicing their cultural heritage of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism has been to their advantage. This thesis has been reinforced by Communist China s phenomenal success in the global economy. At the same time East Asia has found cultural consonance with the philosophy of Constructive post-modernism. This has been a movement in the West which questions the precepts of modernism, its materialism and lack of spirituality, its failure to achieve harmony in society and amongst nations, and its excessive exploitation of Mother Nature. Constructive post-modernism movement has placed its biggest hope in the harmonious rise of Marxist China. An East Asian champion of globalization has been Singapore. Initially thought too small to exist as a country, Singapore has surprised in reaching the ranks of a global city well within a life span. SINGAPORE [...] Celebrating globalization and fusion of civilizations Singapore is currently ranked 7 th in position as a global city, joining in wealth and influence New York, London and <b>Tokyo.</b> Caux <b>Round</b> Table, a global index of social capital in 2009 ranked Singapore 14 th among 200 countries. Singapore was top in Asia and ahead of the United States and Britain. Singapore s exciting fusion of Western and Asian civilizations started in 1819 when the British East India Company set up a trading post at the sparsely populated island off the Southern tip of Malaya at the strategic Straits of Malacca. When colonial initiatives made Malaya into the world s biggest producer of rubber and tin, the port city grew into the New York of Malaya. Following the usual rhetoric of newly independent countries against colonial exploitation, the Republic of Singapore was pragmatic in remaining closely aligned to the Western world. The elevation of English to be the first language of instruction in all schools not only helped unify multi-lingual Singapore, but also facilitated linkage with the global economy and progress in techno-science. English speaking workers together with other positive factors such as hard work ethics, freedom from labor strikes and corruption attracted MNC investment. Since the 1960 s Singapore has become the biggest MNC hub in the world. In 2007, over 7000 foreign companies account for $ 15 billion or 85 % of fixed asset investment and 44. 5 % of the GDP. Besides MNCs, Western talents in top level management, finance, academia and research have all been recruited. International Advisory Panels (IAP) continue to assist Government and statutory bodies. Unlike much of Asia, a key element in Singapore s success has been winning the war against corruption through political will, tough anti-corruption laws and paying ministers and civil servants well. Transparency International has consistently ranked island-State as one of the least corrupt countries in the world. The livability of Singapore has for past decades been significantly improved by clearance of slumps, clean tree-lined and crime-free streets, decent housing, and access to high quality education and healthcare.
