At that time, mechanical reduction gears for such high power applications were not available. The core idea of hydrodynamic <b>torque</b> <b>converters</b> and fluid couplings is to provide wear free power transmission using a hydraulic closed pump and turbine cycle. In the following decades, hydrodynamic <b>torque</b> <b>converters</b> experienced significant improvements driven by the automotive industry, and their use spread into various applications. Today, <b>torque</b> <b>converters</b> are commonly used in cars, busses, locomotives, construction equipment, and gas compression as a means of (i) smooth power transmission, (ii) to provide torque amplification during startup conditions, and (iii) to act as a damper for driver and driven equipment torsional disturbances and shock loads. In the oil and gas industry, <b>torque</b> <b>converters</b> are often used as integrated components in drive transmissions for electric motor driven compressors or pumps trains. They provide step-less speed variation along with progressive torque increase towards low speed. For example, <b>torque</b> <b>converters</b> and hydraulic couplings can be used to drive a variable speed centrifugal compressor using a fixed speed electric motor without the need for a variable frequency drive. In recent years, <b>torque</b> <b>converters</b> in combination with planetary gearboxes have been successfully demonstrated as a viable technology for variable speed electric motor driven centrifugal compressor applications. <b>Torque</b> <b>converters</b> are also used as soft starters between generators and gas or steam turbines.
