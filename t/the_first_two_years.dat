5|$|Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet {{was largely}} {{obsolete}} at {{the outbreak of}} World War I, and over <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> of the war the Austro-Hungarian Navy focused its efforts on building a U-boat fleet for local defense within the Adriatic.

5|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some {{children with autism}} reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.|$|E

The Muslims were probably preoccupied with organizing their new province, while the Byzantines were too weak to react, and could not expect any reinforcements: the Empire faced mounting pressure in the East, where the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun launched repeated invasions of the Byzantine borderlands and threatened to march on Constantinople itself until his sudden death in August 833.|$|E

5|$|Priestley {{eventually}} {{decided to}} return to his theological studies and, in 1752, matriculated at Daventry, a Dissenting academy. Because he had already read widely, Priestley was allowed to skip <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> of coursework. He continued his intense study; this, together with the liberal atmosphere of the school, shifted his theology further leftward and he became a Rational Dissenter. Abhorring dogma and religious mysticism, Rational Dissenters emphasised the rational analysis of the natural world and the Bible.|$|E

5|$|After commissioning, Schlesien was {{assigned}} to the I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. She served with the fleet throughout <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> of World War I; by this time she had been transferred to the II Battle Squadron alongside her four sister ships. Schlesien was present at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916, where she was actively engaged only briefly. After Jutland, she was relegated to guard duties before being withdrawn altogether in 1917, when she became a training ship. The Treaty of Versailles permitted the German navy to retain eight obsolete battleships, which included Schlesien, to defend the German coast. She saw extensive service with the reorganized Reichsmarine; in the 1920s and 1930s the ship was rebuilt and eventually converted back into a training ship.|$|E
