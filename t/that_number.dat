5|$|Due to the {{withdrawal}} of U.S. forces under the policy of Vietnamization, from 1 November 1968 until 23 February 1973, Barrel Roll competed for a share of diminishing U.S tactical air assets. In December 1968, approximately 700 American strike aircraft had been available in-theater. By the spring of 1972, <b>that</b> <b>number</b> had fallen to 313. On 18 July, the Nakhon Phanom-based 22nd Special Operations Squadron was disbanded. Its sister squadron, the 602nd Special Operations Squadron, closed out on 20 December, leaving only the 1st Special Operations Squadron at Nakhon Phanom to support Royal Laotian ground operations. The RLAF attempted {{to make up for}} the diminishing number of American sorties. During 1968 the Laotians flew 10,000 strike sorties. During 1970 through 1972 <b>that</b> <b>number</b> increased to over 30,000 in each year.|$|E

40|$|Studying human’s {{ability to}} {{estimate}} temporal durations {{could lead to}} a greater understanding of our cognitive abilities as well as the processes that underlie temporal estimation. It has been shown through previous research <b>that</b> time and <b>number</b> may be interconnected cognitively and that the magnitude of one may alter the perception of the other, which could be tested by using numerical anchors. I proposed that larger single digit anchors will cause overestimation of duration and smaller single digit anchors will cause underestimation of duration in both the millisecond and second ranges. A total of six experiments were completed testing the idea <b>that</b> <b>numbers</b> can anchor duration judgments. The first two experiments tested the ability of numbers to alter time perceptions in the millisecond range. The last four experiments tested the ability of numbers to alter time perceptions in the second range. Overall only durations lasting for a matter of milliseconds showed significant results implying <b>that</b> <b>numbers</b> could alter the perception of time in the millisecond range. These experiments could further support the idea <b>that</b> <b>numbers</b> can alter the perception of millisecond timing. These experiments do not support the idea <b>that</b> <b>numbers</b> can alter the perception of second timing...|$|R

Starting in May 1945, MacArthur used his Australian troops in the invasion of Borneo. He accompanied the assault on Labuan, and visited the troops ashore. While returning to GHQ in Manila, he visited Davao, where he told Eichelberger that no more than 4,000 Japanese remained alive on Mindanao.

5|$|As December began, the Japanese {{experienced}} considerable {{difficulty in}} keeping their troops on Guadalcanal resupplied because of Allied air and naval {{attacks on the}} Japanese supply chain of ships and bases. The few supplies delivered to the island were not enough to sustain Japanese troops, who by 7 December were losing about 50men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks. The Japanese had delivered almost 30,000 army troops to Guadalcanal since the campaign began, but by December only about 20,000 of <b>that</b> <b>number</b> were still alive, and only about 12,000 remained more or less fit for combat duty, with the rest incapacitated by battle wounds, disease, or malnutrition.|$|E

The new Ford factory producing aircraft engines was bombed only a few days after its opening in May 1941. Trafford Hall was severely damaged by bombing, and was demolished shortly after the war ended. At the outbreak of war in 1939 there were an estimated 50,000 workers employed in the park.
