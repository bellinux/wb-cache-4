5|$|A {{planning}} {{office was}} established in 1962, initially led by Erik Himle. The final plans for the route were passed by parliament in 1968, and construction started in 1971. <b>The</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> building of the station was that Frogner was to be developed as a dense, commercial district. However, to cut costs with the Oslo Tunnel, {{it was decided that}} parts of Nationaltheatret would not be built yet, and that Elisenberg Station would not open until after the tunnel was completed. By 1978, the platform area had been built, but the access way had not. The investments cost 30 million Norwegian krone (NOK), 75 mill. of 1998 standard. The Oslo Tunnel opened, without Elisenberg Station, on 1 June 1980.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, some {{shows have}} moved their Tuesday show time {{an hour earlier}} to 7:00p.m. <b>The</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> move was that since fewer {{tourists}} take in shows midweek then the Tuesday attendance, in particular, depends on the local audience.

Some shows, especially those produced by Disney, change their performance schedules fairly frequently depending on the season. This is done in order to maximize access to their target audience.|$|E

25|$|Kingship was a {{key element}} of Egyptian religion, through the king's role as link between {{humanity}} and the gods. Myths explain the background for this connection between royalty and divinity. The myths about the Ennead establish the king as heir to the lineage of rulers reaching back to the creator; the myth of divine birth states that the king is the son and heir of a god; and the myths about Osiris and Horus emphasize that rightful succession to the throne is essential to the maintenance of maat.

25|$|Lord Diplock {{explained}} that <b>the</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> section 15 presumption was {{the difficulty in}} proving the purpose of trafficking. In drug trafficking cases, the strongest attainable evidence {{was likely to be}} the act of transporting the drugs. Regardless of this, his Lordship held that {{even in the absence of}} section 15, it could be inferred that the transportation of a large quantity of drugs was for trafficking purposes. As a matter of common sense, the larger the quantity, the more likely it is for trafficking. Therefore, the appellants' argument that the Court of Criminal Appeal had erred in construing the presumption created by section 15(2) of the MDA was rejected.|$|E

25|$|In 328 BC, Alexander The Great of Macedonia and now {{the king}} of Persia, had conquered much of the former Satraps of the Achaemenid Empire up to Bactria. The {{remaining}} satraps lay in the Indus Valley, but Alexander ruled off invading the Indus until his forces were in complete control of the newly acquired satraps. In 327 BC, Alexander married Roxana (a princess of the former Bactria satrapy) to cement his relations with his new territories. Now firmly under Macedonian rule, Alexander was free to turn {{his attention to the}} Indus Valley. <b>The</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Indus campaign is usually said to be Alexander's desire to conquer the entire known world, which the Greeks thought ended around the vicinity of the River Indus.|$|E

25|$|The Union-Garratt did {{not enjoy}} {{the success of the}} {{standard}} Garratt. It was soon evident that mechanical stokers could function perfectly across the connection between a Garratt's boiler and engine unit, making <b>the</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Union-Garratt obsolete. The Union-Garratts' extended boiler frames and the position of the bunker and hind water tank upon those frames meant that they suffered from many of the problems which beset the Mallet design; the SAR U and GH classes had much heavier axle-loadings than Garratts of comparable size, weight and power, and the movement of water at the extreme ends of the long main frames generated high wear on the hind pivot between the boiler and engine unit. The Union-Garratt, like the Golwe and Modified Fairlie, was not perpetuated on anything like the scale of the Garratt, and no known examples survive.|$|E

[...] <b>The</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> proposal {{was that it would}} be an overall shorter route and would cost much less to construct. [...] The proposal was met with stiff opposition including all four U.S. senators from California and Arizona sending the Secretary of Commerce letters requesting that the routing through Needles be retained. [...] This proposal was eventually abandoned in 1966 and the routing through Needles was kept.|$|E
500|$|Three of the Blacks' {{leaders had}} already been {{captured}} during {{the passage of the}} Act, although one later escaped, and a series of raids captured a total of 32 Blacks who were tried after the Act's passage in Reading. Four were sentenced to death for the killing of the gamekeeper's son, with the executions occurring on 15 June 1723. Trials for the others continued into 1724, and 7 more were captured and tried on 7 December. This marked the effective end of the Blacks as an organised group. At the time, it was thought that the Blacks were Jacobites, with Sir Robert Walpole encouraging these ideas to advance his own interests; <b>the</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Act has been described as [...] "at least {{as much to do with}} the hysteria induced by Walpole...as with any need for new powers to fight deer-stealing".|$|E
500|$|The Ostend Manifesto, [...] Ostend Circular, was a {{document}} written in 1854 that described <b>the</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United States to purchase Cuba from Spain while {{implying that the}} U.S. should declare war if Spain refused. Cuba's annexation had long been a goal of U.S. slaveholding expansionists, and {{was supported by a}} faction in Cuba itself. At the national level, American leaders had been satisfied to have the island remain in weak Spanish hands so long as it did not pass to a stronger power such as Britain or France. The Ostend Manifesto proposed a shift in foreign policy, justifying the use of force to seize Cuba in the name of national security. It resulted from debates over slavery in the United States, Manifest Destiny, and the Monroe Doctrine, as slaveholders sought new territory for slavery's expansion.|$|E

500|$|In May 1865, {{while still}} serving on Grant's staff, Comstock {{was called to}} serve {{as one of the}} nine {{military}} commissioners to oversee the trial of the conspirators in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. [...] At first, Comstock was eager to see the prosecution of the conspirators, writing that, for them, [...] "death is too good." [...] However, as the trial proceeded, Comstock became disturbed by the secrecy of the military proceedings. [...] Concerned about the violation of the defendants' rights, he began to openly argue for the case to be transferred to a civilian court. [...] President Andrew Johnson removed Comstock from the commission due to Comstock's protests. [...] <b>The</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> removal, as explained to Comstock by Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, was that Grant had also been a potential target of the conspirators and the commissioners felt that Comstock, due to his closeness to Grant, could not be counted on to act impartially.|$|E
500|$|The Royal Navy was {{thinking}} along similar lines. A design had been circulated in 1902–03 for [...] "a powerful 'all big-gun' armament of two calibres, viz. four 12-inch and twelve 9.2-inch guns." [...] The Admiralty {{decided to build}} three more s (with a mixture of 12-inch, 9.2-inch and [...] ) in the 1903–04 naval construction programme instead. The all-big-gun concept was revived for the 1904–05 programme, the [...] Restrictions on length and beam meant the midships 9.2-inch turrets became single instead of twin, thus giving an armament of four 12-inch, ten 9.2-inch and no 6-inch. The constructor for this design, J.H. Narbeth, submitted an alternative drawing showing an armament of twelve 12-inch guns, but the Admiralty {{was not prepared to}} accept this. Part of <b>the</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> decision to retain mixed-calibre guns was the need to begin the building of the ships quickly because of the tense situation produced by the Russo-Japanese War.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of the}} Potato Sack ARG {{came from}} Valve {{president}} Gabe Newell sometime around December 2010. Following {{on the success of}} the first ARG, he saw a way to promote both the highly anticipated Portal 2 release along with several independent games through a [...] "Cross Game Design Event". Dejobaan Games' Leo Jaitley believed that Valve targeted developers that had proven track records of working with other developers, and not necessarily for the sales or popularity of the specific games. Valve invited the twenty independent developers to their headquarters on December 16, though did not explain <b>the</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> visit. Only there did Valve explain the promotion, with the ultimate goal being the early release of Portal 2 {{at the conclusion of the}} ARG, according to Gaijin Games' CEO Alex Neuse. According to Rob Jagnow of Lazy 8 Studios, Valve assured the developers of an open relationship, stating that they had [...] "No constraints. No NDAs." [...] and that the project was [...] "built on trust and mutual respect". Jaitley commented [...] "most studios got involved knowing that there was likely to be some payoff, but without anything upfront or any promises of riches".|$|E
