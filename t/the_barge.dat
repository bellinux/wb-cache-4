5|$|Bedell {{sponsored}} several bold initiatives {{during his}} tenure in the United States House of Representatives. One initiative, which came from his constituents' problems with <b>the</b> <b>barge</b> industry, focused on waterway usage fees. He introduced legislation in 1977 that would require <b>the</b> <b>barge</b> industry to pay a fee for using the waterways which, Bedell pointed out, the Government paid {{millions of dollars to}} create and maintain. Bedell's original plan set the rate <b>the</b> <b>barge</b> industry paid as directly related to the amount the Government spent on waterway projects. This would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects, and it was the same plan proposed by Pete Domenici in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|They were hauled by two {{or three}} margoulins, men who walked on the towpaths pulling <b>the</b> <b>barge</b> with a harness over their shoulder. It took about 18 hours to pull a barge through the canal. A marinier stood {{on the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>barge</b> {{steering}} it with a wooden pole. Lock-keepers operated the locks and helped manoeuver the barges using a boat hook. Porters loaded and unloaded the barges. They were called crocheteurs after the iron hooks that they used to move bales of goods.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1974, one of the barges began to take on water, {{dragging}} down the other two. No part of <b>the</b> <b>barge</b> is visible above water. Elmer S. Dailey is listed in the U.S. Registry as #166315.|$|E
25|$|After a {{few more}} hours, the strikers {{attempted}} to burn <b>the</b> <b>barges.</b> They seized a raft, loaded it with oil-soaked timber and floated it toward <b>the</b> <b>barges.</b> <b>The</b> Pinkertons nearly panicked, and a Pinkerton captain had to threaten to shoot anyone who fled. But the fire burned itself out before it reached <b>the</b> <b>barges.</b> <b>The</b> strikers then loaded a railroad flatcar with drums of oil and set it afire. The flatcar hurtled down the rails toward the mill's wharf where <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> were docked. But the car stopped at the water's edge and burned itself out. Dynamite was thrown at <b>the</b> <b>barges,</b> but it only hit the mark once (causing a little damage to one <b>barge).</b> At 2:00p.m., <b>the</b> workers poured oil onto the river, hoping the oil slick would burn the barges; attempts to light the slick failed.|$|R
5000|$|Suea Class <b>Barges</b> are <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> with <b>the</b> {{painting}} of a tiger, Suea Thayan Chon and Suea Kamron Sin. The names of <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> are clearly written on the bow in red lettering.|$|R
50|$|From Pauillac, the A380 {{parts are}} transported by <b>barge</b> through <b>the</b> centre of Bordeaux on the River Garonne. <b>The</b> <b>barges</b> carry <b>the</b> parts to Langon, where a special dock {{has been built}} to permit the {{offloading}} of <b>the</b> <b>barges.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Berkshire No. 7 has {{historical}} importance {{because of}} its design, which reflects the construction of 19th-century canal boats. However, {{there is no record}} that <b>the</b> <b>barge</b> was ever used on a canal. <b>The</b> <b>barge</b> is one of two surviving wooden-hulled canal boats in existence. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1978. Its nomination and listing is unusual because the Berkshire No. 7 was not yet 50 {{years old at the time}} of its nomination, and it sank in 1974. It and the other two barges that sank with it are the only shipwrecks in Connecticut listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Washington Irving was {{valued at}} $1,000,000 but insured for much less. <b>The</b> <b>barge</b> {{suffered}} only $8,000 of damages. At {{the time of}} the sinking, Alexander McKinney was the head porter. He had joined the Day Line in 1905 and continued in their service till at least 1964.|$|E
5|$|While {{wandering}} in the woods, Finn and Jake fall down two separate holes. Finn {{lands in the}} Kingdom of Huge, where he is greeted by its sovereign, King Huge. The king lavishes Finn with food and asks that he stay and watch the chiming of his cuckoo clock. However, it soon becomes apparent that King Huge is insane; he demands that Finn remain and watch every time the clock chimes the hour. Meanwhile, Jake lands on <b>the</b> <b>barge</b> of a bear named Seven. According to Seven, <b>the</b> <b>barge</b> has been falling for years, and he warns Jake not to try and escape, lest he die.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Google <b>barges</b> were a {{group of}} four {{floating}} barges built between 2010 and 2012, intended by Google to serve as [...] "an interactive space where people can learn about new technology", possibly as luxury showrooms for Google Glass and other products on an invitation-only basis. Google halted work on <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> in late 2013 and began selling off <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> in 2014.|$|R
2500|$|The Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Barges</b> or Day of <b>the</b> <b>Barges</b> ( [...] ) {{was fought}} on October 24, 869 near Basra. It {{was one of}} the first major engagements of the Zanj Rebellion, taking place less than two months after the {{outbreak}} of the revolt.|$|R
25|$|The strikers {{continued}} to sporadically fire on <b>the</b> stranded <b>barges,</b> and an {{attempt was made}} to sink <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> with a cannon. When the Pinkertons tried to disembark again at 8:00a.m., a firefight broke out and four more strikers were killed. The strikers attempted to burn <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> several times during the day, but failed. At 5:00p.m., the Pinkertons surrendered and were handed over to the sheriff.|$|R
5|$|A wooden {{bridge was}} {{built over the}} Kennet at Newbury in 1726, {{replaced}} in stone between 1769 and 1772 by James Clarke, and {{now known as the}} Town Bridge or Water Bridge. As there is no tow path, a line to haul <b>the</b> <b>barge</b> had to be floated under the bridge and then re-attached to the horse where the tow path resumed.|$|E
5|$|Construction, {{such as the}} North-South Arterial Highway project, {{supports}} the public-sector job market. Although passenger and commercial traffic on the Erie Canal has declined greatly since the 19thcentury, <b>the</b> <b>barge</b> canal still allows heavy cargo to travel through Utica at low cost, bypassing the New York State Thruway and providing intermodal freight transport with the railroads.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Finn has enough, {{and knocks}} the king's clock from the wall. It crashes into the kingdom's huge stove, {{knocking}} over {{a pot of}} water. The water puts out the fire, which causes the warm updraft going into the chimney to cease; this updraft was actually holding Seven's barge in stasis all of this time. <b>The</b> <b>barge</b> comes crashing down into the kingdom, and Jake uses his stretching powers to save Finn. Thence, Finn, Jake, and Seven escape.|$|E
2500|$|The strikers then huddled {{behind the}} pig and scrap iron in the mill yard, while the Pinkertons cut {{holes in the}} side of <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> so they could fire on any who approached. [...] The Pinkerton tug {{departed}} with the wounded agents, leaving <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> stranded. <b>The</b> strikers soon set to work building a rampart of steel beams further up the riverbank from which they could fire down on <b>the</b> <b>barges.</b> Hundreds of women continued to crowd on the riverbank between the strikers and the agents, calling on the strikers to 'kill the Pinkertons'.|$|R
25|$|In the meantime, {{the men on}} <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> {{that had}} been pushed past the entry point by the river's current had {{struggled}} {{to bring them back}} to a landing. More citizens rushed out to defend the city against the new group of marauders. Schenck's force, divided and beset at all sides, was pushed back to the river. Several of the soldiers managed to push <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> into <b>the</b> river, and pull some of their comrades to safety, but it was difficult work: the darkness and the swiftness of the current made steadying <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> difficult, and <b>the</b> angry citizens of Nijmegen were firing arrows and small arms at the marauders. Eventually the soldiers forwent the ropes and scaling hooks, and simply jumped into the river, hoping to swim to <b>the</b> <b>barges.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1860s, Alfred Castle used to moor his {{vessels in}} Sharp's Green Bay (see more later), to collect chalk {{from a nearby}} quarry in Twydall, before heading across the water to his two cement works on Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey. The chalk was carted to <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> from <b>the</b> quarry, then <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> would be loaded at low tide, as the draught (draft (hull) of the vessel would require more water under the keel to float off the mud. Due to tidal constraints, <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> were loaded by hand. Castle later built a wooden jetty further down the channel leading to a small {{peninsula}} in the river. This then allowed <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> to load at high and low tides. Later, to improve the speed of loading, he built a narrow gauge horse-drawn railway from the quarry to the new wooden jetty. Trucks on the railway had side-tippers, so could just tip their loads into <b>the</b> <b>barges.</b> <b>The</b> chalk was then transported to Queenborough via seven barges, owned by Alfred and his brother James. The works produced 400 tons of cement a week.|$|R
5|$|In 1851 the Earl of Ellesmere {{hosted a}} visit to Manchester by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. They stayed at Worsley Hall, {{with a view of}} the canal, and were given a trip between Patricroft railway station and Worsley Hall, on state barges. Large crowds had {{gathered}} to cheer the royal party, which apparently frightened the horses drawing <b>the</b> <b>barge</b> so much that they fell into the canal.|$|E
5|$|On 18 February 1928, Siboney rammed {{and sank}} the coal barge Seneca off Ambrose Light during a snowstorm; <b>the</b> <b>barge</b> {{had been cut}} down in 1915 from SSSeneca, coincidentally, a former Ward Line ship. Bad luck {{continued}} for Siboney on 5January 1929, when she rammed and sank the Bauer Towing Company tug Phillip Hoffman off the Battery, killing the tug’s engineer.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>barge</b> {{was used}} to {{transport}} materials between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, and after the diesel engines were added, {{it was able to}} push another barge. It was in service between 1941 and 1972, and afterwards was moored in Bridgeport Harbor together with the Berkshire No. 7 and Priscilla Dailey, two other barges.|$|E

5|$|The tug Atlantic Elm {{lost its}} tow to the {{unmanned}} barge Portland Star on October19. <b>The</b> <b>barge</b> was carrying over 18,000 tonnes of cement and diesel fuel {{and was later}} reported to have sunk in the Fortune Bay. Damage was reported to numerous pleasure craft around the bay due to the waves; two sailboats were toppled. Also, ferry service between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia was disrupted. Several offshore buoys and ships reported high winds and low barometric pressure, as well as waves of up to 16.9m (55ft).|$|E
5|$|Currently {{the only}} barge in use, the Vernon C. Bain Center {{is the third}} prison barge that the New York Department of Corrections has used. In its history, the prison has served {{traditional}} inmates, juvenile inmates and is currently used as a holding and temporary processing center. The added security of the prison being on water has prevented at least four attempted escapes. <b>The</b> <b>barge</b> is named in memorial for warden Vernon C. Bain who died in an automobile accident. In 2014, the prison barge was named the world's largest prison barge in operation by the Guinness World Records.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the {{historic}} {{status of the}} barges was {{a concern for the}} Port Authority of Bridgeport Harbor, as the sunken ships interfered with a billion-dollar redevelopment project. Over the years, the barges had deteriorated so that a salvage operation would likely result in them breaking apart. No action had been taken by 2003, but a report noted that prior to any activity of the Berkshire No. 7, the Federal Transit Administration and/or the City of Bridgeport should document <b>the</b> <b>barge</b> with photos and a technical description. Specifics regarding the documentation based on the activity would be archived at the State Historic Preservation Office and the Mystic Seaport Museum.|$|E

5|$|For three hours, Experiment battled <b>the</b> <b>barges,</b> sinking two {{and killing}} {{a great many}} of the picaroons. During this time two of <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> left <b>the</b> warship and {{attacked}} the merchant ships. These barges managed to protect themselves from Experiment by sailing behind the schooner Mary, which was between <b>the</b> two <b>barges</b> and <b>the</b> warship. The Haitians boarded Mary and killed her captain. Many of the crew jumped into the sea, and the rest hid in the hold. <b>The</b> second <b>barge</b> attempted to take Daniel and Mary but was sunk by fire from Experiment. Once the Haitians had boarded Mary, Experiment opened fire upon her with grapeshot, driving the picaroons off.|$|R

5|$|In this episode, the half-Klingon, half-human B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) has a near-death {{experience}} and {{is sent to}} the Klingon version of Hell known as Gre'thor. There she encounters her Klingon mother Miral (Karen Austin), who is damned because of Torres' refusal to fully accept her own identity as a Klingon. After being resuscitated by the Voyager crew, Torres becomes intent on revisiting Gre'thor to save her mother. The episode also guest stars Eric Pierpoint as Kortar, who ferries the souls of the dishonored on <b>the</b> <b>Barge</b> of the Dead, and Sherman Augustus as the dead Klingon Hij'Qa.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, gales {{from the}} former {{hurricane}} swept across the Great Lakes. Hundreds of spectators lined the shores of Lake Michigan at Chicago, Illinois, to watch the enormous waves. A schooner was torn from its moorings at Chicago, and crashed into nearly a dozen smaller vessels while being blown about. The schooner Belle from Racine, Wisconsin, went missing amid the storm, while <b>the</b> <b>barge</b> Sumatra broke up and capsized near Milwaukee, taking the lives of four crew members; the captain, first mate, and cook were safely rescued. The storm damaged around $75,000 worth of property on the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|Priscilla Dailey, {{previously}} {{known as}} the Elizabeth E. Newell, is a wooden canal boat constructed in 1929 in Whitehall, New York. <b>The</b> <b>barge</b> was used to transport bulk cargo in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut harbors. It sunk in 1974 along with the Elmer S. Dailey and the Berkshire No. 7 in the harbor of Bridgeport, Connecticut {{on the west side}} of the Pequonnock River. The sunken boat has deteriorated to the point that a salvage operation could result in it breaking apart. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1978.|$|E
25|$|The {{deportees}} {{were kept}} below decks on <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> and apparently fed a daily ration of 200 grams of bread per person. Twenty tons of flour - about four kilos per person - were also transported, but <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> contained no other food, cooking utensils, or tools. All supervisory personnel, two commanders and fifty guards, were newly recruited. The guards had no shoes or uniforms.|$|R
50|$|On 21 January 1943, Tui and Moa {{came across}} four Japanese landing barges stopped close inshore. When Tui and Moa closed in, those aboard <b>the</b> <b>barges</b> opened fire {{with machine guns}} and small arms, and got under way. At close range Moa fired on <b>the</b> leading <b>barge,</b> but a fluke shot passed through the 4-inch gun aperture, ignited a cordite charge and injured all seven in the gun crew. Moa managed to silence <b>the</b> first <b>barge</b> and sink <b>the</b> last in line with 20mm fire, then withdrew and {{attended}} to the cordite fire and injuries. Tui then opened fire on <b>the</b> <b>barges,</b> sinking one with her 4 inch gun, and the remaining two escaped inshore in the darkness.|$|R
