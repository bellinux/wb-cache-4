40|$|BACKGROUND: Reducing {{treatment}} delay improves {{outcomes in}} breast cancer. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine factors influencing patient- and system-related delays in commencing breast cancer treatment in different countries. METHODS: A total of 6588 female breast cancer patients from 12 countries were surveyed. Total <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> was determined as the sum of the patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> (time between onset of the first symptoms and the first medical visit) and system-related <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> (time between the first medical visit and the start of therapy). RESULTS: The average patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> and total <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> were 4. 7 (range: 3. 4 - 6. 2) weeks and 14. 4 (range: 11. 5 - 29. 4) weeks, respectively. Longer patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> were associated with distrust and disregard, and shorter patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> were associated with fear of breast cancer, practicing self-examination, higher education level, being employed, having support from friends and family and living in big cities. The average system-related <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> was 11. 1 (range: 8. 3 - 24. 7) weeks. Cancer diagnosis made by an oncologist versus another physician, higher education level, older age, family history of female cancers and having a breast lump as the first cancer sign were associated with shorter system-related <b>delay</b> <b>times.</b> Longer patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> and higher levels of distrust and disregard were predictors of longer system-related <b>delay</b> <b>times.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The <b>delay</b> in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer remains a serious problem. Several psychological and behavioural patient attributes strongly determine both patient-related <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> and system-related <b>delay</b> <b>time,</b> but their strength is different in particular countries...|$|R

40|$|An optimal discrete-time direct output-feedback control {{algorithm}} is developed with {{the consideration of}} sampling period and appropriate <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> in its control force action. Optimal-delayed output-feedback gains are derived through a variation process and will be complementarily arranged {{with respect to the}} applied <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> by either altering their magnitude or phases to assure the efficacy and stability of the delayed direct digital control system. Parametric studies of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems with different feedback types demonstrate the relationships of the delayed gains and the modal properties corresponding to the sampling period used and the intentionally <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> added. The maximum allowable <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> defined at the onset of instability of controlled system can be the optimal <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> that reaches the optimal control performance if the <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> is considered in the delayed feedback gains. The inclusion of sampling period and <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> in the optimization process for discrete-time control illustrates the beneficial effect under the same <b>delay</b> <b>time.</b> Numerical simulation results of proposed direct digital control principles on a three-degree-of-freedom (3 DOF) shaking table structure model show that the efficacy of the collocated control cases with optimal <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> to reduce the dynamic responses subjected to earthquake excitations is assured.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> {{effects on the}} {{stability}} and performance of active feedback control systems for engineering structures. A computer algorithm is developed for stability analysis of a SDOF system with unequal <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> pair in the velocity and displacement feedback loops. It is found that there may exist multiple stable regions in {{the plane of the}} <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> pair, which contain <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> greater than the maximum allowable values obtained by previous studies. The size, shape and location of these stable and unstable regions depend on the system parameters and the feedback control gains. For systems with multiple stable regions, the boundaries between the stable and unstable regions in the plane of the <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> pair are explicitly obtained. The <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> pairs that forms these boundaries are called the critical <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> pairs at which the steady-state response becomes unbounded. The conclusions are valid for both large and small <b>delay</b> <b>times.</b> For any system with multiple stable regions, preliminary guidelines obtained from an explicit formula are given to find the desirable <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> pair(s). When used, these desirable <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> pair(s) not only stabilize an unstable system with inherent <b>time</b> <b>delays,</b> but also significantly reduce the system response and control force. For any system with multiple stable regions, these desirable <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> pair(s) are above the maximum allowable <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> obtained by previous studies.

40|$|The average <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of the nodes (intersections and roundabouts) in dynamic {{traffic flow}} {{is one of}} the key {{elements}} of predicting travel time. However, determining and updating the average <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of the dynamic traffic flow as regards to the calculation of travel time has received very limited attention, even though most of the current techniques uses historical data for the statistical calculations. Average <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of the intersections and roundabouts needs to be updated due to the changing of the dynamic traffic conditions. The aim of this study is to propose a method allowing to find a formula for determining the average dynamic <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of intersections and roundabouts. The proposed method calculates the dynamic average <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> by using the output of the SIDRA intersection software (micro simulation transportation one) and finds the relationships among the effective parameters and their effect on the average <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> by using optimized GMDH software.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that small changes in concentration of higher hydrocarbons in natural gas can severely reduce ignition <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of methane-based fuels. To increase the database of auto-ignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> for methane-based fuel mixtures characteristic of natural gas, experiments to measure auto-ignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> have been performed for a variety of gaseous fuels in an atmospheric flow reactor. Autoignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> were measured for pure fuels in air including methane, ethylene, ethane, and propane. The effect of higher hydrocarbon addition on methane-based fuel ignition delay was then investigated for fuel mixtures composed of methane/ethylene, methane/ethane, and methane/propane where methane composition varied from 25 - 95 % by volume. Autoignition <b>delay</b> <b>times</b> were also measured for multi-component methane-based fuels composed of methane/ethane/propane and air. Finally the effect of CO 2 addition on methane autoignition was investigated. For all experiments, equivalence ratios for the experiments ranged between 0. 5 and 1. 25 and temperatures ranged from 931 - 1137 K. The most dramatic decrease (30 - 60 %) in auto-ignition <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of binary methane-based fuels occurred with the addition of the first 5 - 10 % of a higher hydrocarbon. Further addition of a higher hydrocarbon continued to reduce auto-ignition <b>delay</b> <b>time,</b> but less dramatically. Similarly, addition of small concentrations of methane to higher order hydrocarbons dramatically increased auto-ignition <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> as compared with the auto-ignition <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of the pure higher-order hydrocarbon. This trend was found for all binary mixtures of methane/ethylene, methane/ethane, and methane/propane. CO 2 addition of 5 - 10 % decreased auto-ignition <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of fuel mixtures, but the effect was minimal. The measurements made in this study will benefit the combustion community by both providing valuable insight into the effects of additives on methane ignition as well as validation data for chemical kinetic mechanisms for predicting ignition of methane-based fuels...|$|R

The ignition <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> of each pulse is investigated by recording the voltage signal and the light emission signal.

This indicates that residual active species produced in the previous discharge {{play a role in the}} next one. With the decrease in the frequency, both <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> and ignition <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> increase. This is due to the decay of the reactive species densities in the pulse-off time.
