25|$|The same banking {{agencies}} {{that are responsible}} for supervising depository institutions are also the {{agencies that}} conduct examinations for CRA compliance. These agencies are the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). In 1981, to help achieve the goals of the CRA, each of the Federal Reserve banks established a Community Affairs Office to work with banking institutions and the public in identifying credit needs within the community and ways to address <b>those</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{regulatory}} process for TCPL proved long and arduous. After rejecting proposals twice, Alberta finally granted its permission to export {{gas from the}} province in 1953. At first, the province waited for explorers to prove gas reserves sufficient for its thirty-year needs, intending to only allow exports in excess of <b>those</b> <b>needs.</b> After clearing this hurdle, the federal government virtually compelled TCPL into a merger with Western pipelines. When this reorganized TCPL went before the Federal Power Commission for permission to sell gas into the United States, the Americans greeted it coolly. The FPC proved sceptical of the project's financing and unimpressed with Alberta's reserves.|$|E

25|$|Located {{less than}} one and {{one-half}} miles from downtown, Upper Monroe encompasses 17 streets with 1,400 households and approximately 3,300 residents. Cobbs Hill Park, with its beautiful reservoir, tennis courts and athletic fields, forms the southeastern boundary of this neighborhood. Highland Park, world-renowned for its annual Lilac Festival, also is within walking distance. The Upper Monroe Neighborhood Association (UMNA) is a not-for-profit advocacy group representing the residents and property owners of the Upper Monroe neighborhood. Its goals are to ascertain the needs and concerns of the neighborhood and take positive action to address <b>those</b> <b>needs</b> and concerns. The neighborhood {{is also home to}} a number of small, local businesses including: Hardpact, Huey's Hair Company, Monty's Krown, Jeremiah's Tavern, and Park Ave. Pets.|$|E
500|$|Progressive Era reformers {{sought to}} improve {{municipal}} government by such changes as the commission system, city planning, and zoning controls. The interests of white business and residential districts were protected, but sometimes {{at the expense}} of blacks who lived in segregated neighborhoods. Fairbanks (1999) explores the changing assumptions about city planning and government among the city's leaders. [...] Dissatisfied with its haphazard development they endorsed centralized planning and wrote and secured the adoption of a new charter and set up a board of commissioners. The commission structure, however, caused government officials to view the city in separate parts rather than as a whole. By the 1920s supporters of comprehensive planning were calling for a program that included adoption of council-manager government, a citywide zoning policy, and public funds for improvements in parks, sewers, schools, and city streets. Voters approved the bond proposals and charter amendments in 1927 and 1930. Dallas thus achieved a more coordinated government which was theoretically more aware of the city's needs and more able to treat <b>those</b> <b>needs</b> equally {{for the benefit of the}} city as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Barry was {{distinguished}} in {{the subsequent}} case R. v. East Sussex County Council, ex parte Tandy (1998), in which the reduction of home tuition services provided by East Sussex County Council to a young myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome) sufferer was challenged. The services were reduced due to {{a cut in the}} authority's home tuition budget. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, speaking for the House of Lords, noted that the statute in question in Barry had required the decision-maker to assess the [...] "needs" [...] of disabled people and whether arranging for home care services to be provided was [...] "necessary in order to meet" [...] <b>those</b> <b>needs.</b> The statute only listed the services that could be provided, and did not define what [...] "needs" [...] meant. Thus, it was [...] "perhaps not surprising" [...] that the court had laid down the availability of resources as a criterion for determining what should be considered [...] "needs". On the other hand, in Tandy the statute involved imposed on the authority a duty to arrange to provide [...] "suitable education" [...] to the applicant, which was defined according to [...] "wholly objective educational criteria". Financial resources were not mentioned at all. In the circumstances, the judge held that the extent of the latter was not a consideration relevant to the authority's decision. He also commented that since it had not been submitted that the authority lacked resources to perform its duty, this was a situation of the authority preferring to spend money on other matters. Thus, the authority could divert funds from discretionary matters and apply them to fulfil its statutory duty.|$|E

2500|$|The content {{theory was}} one of the {{earliest}} theories of motivation. Content theories can also be referred to needs theories, because the theory focuses on the importance of what motivates people (needs).

2500|$|The terms {{corporate}} finance and corporate financier are {{also associated with}} investment banking.

2500|$|Baudrillard {{came to this}} {{conclusion}} by criticising Marx's concept of [...] "use-value". Baudrillard thought that both Marx's and Adam Smith's economic thought accepted the idea of genuine needs relating to genuine uses too easily and too simply. Baudrillard argued, drawing from Georges Bataille, that needs are constructed, rather than innate. He stressed that all purchases, because they always signify something socially, have their fetishistic side. Objects always, drawing from Roland Barthes, [...] "say something" [...] about their users. And this was, for him, why consumption was and remains more important than production: because the [...] "ideological genesis of needs" [...] precedes the production of goods to meet <b>those</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Emotional {{support is}} just as {{important}} in employee health as it is in non-work related circumstances. [...] It is important for POS to be high because an employee's feeling of belonging, respect, and support raises his or her morale, which has a positive effect on performance. [...] It is similar to the feeling of support from family and friends. [...] However, although each employee most likely has some need to be fulfilled, <b>those</b> <b>needs</b> are not necessarily all the same. [...] Also, some employees might need more support than others. [...] Some might have higher socioemotional needs. [...] An example given in an article on POS was about police officers. [...] The police officers who needed more [...] "approval, esteem, emotional support, or affiliation" [...] issued more speeding tickets and arrested more people for driving under the influence when their POS was high.|$|E

As the Forestry Service began to develop its lookouts in Arizona forests, the men and animals needed to man those lookouts could sometimes be accommodated at local ranches/farms. [...] However the isolation of the Lake Mountain lookout necessitated the construction of structures to see to <b>those</b> <b>needs.</b> The station was constructed in 1909-10, the first to be built in the Lakeside district, on 240 acres east of Pinetop-Lakeside, Arizona. The station was built to house a fireguard, who rode to the to the nearby Lake Mountain Lookout to watch for forest fires.|$|E

As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited {{him to stay in}} his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: [...] "Being with them made me so much more sophisticated.
