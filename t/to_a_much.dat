5|$|Upon {{his return}} and owing to a {{shortage}} of officers, a short diversion from his teaching duties during 1893 saw Shaw Jeffrey join the Volunteer battalion of the Royal West Kent Regiment.

5|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between {{the growth rate of}} newly metamorphosed juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes, the specimens studied being from Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. At first the growth rates for males and females was identical. By the time they became mature their growth rate had slowed down to about 21% of the initial rate and they had reached 95% of their expected adult size. Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time. Adjusting for differences in temperature and the length of the growing season, the toads grew and matured at much the same rate from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years for males and 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> greater size taking an average 1.77 years for males and 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.|$|E

5|$|Although most of {{the storms}} {{impacted}} land, overall effects were minimal. Ana caused minor flooding and wind damage in the Carolinas and left two dead in North Carolina. Tropical Storm Bill and its remnants caused flooding primarily in the South Central, Midwestern, and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, while its precursor also left flooding in Central America and Mexico. The storm resulted in two deaths in Honduras, two in Guatemala, one in Mexico, and three deaths in the United States. Additionally, the United States suffered about $17.9million (2015USD) in damage. Claudette and Danny left very minimal impact on land. In late August, Tropical Storm Erika brought heavy rainfall to Dominica, leading to devastating floods. Erika caused nearly $500million in damage and 30fatalities, making it the island's deadliest natural disaster since Hurricane David in 1979. The storm also flooded other nearby islands, but <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> lesser degree, such as Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola. Five additional deaths occurred in Haiti.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} similar atomic radii, {{rubidium}} and caesium {{in the body}} mimic potassium and are taken up similarly. Rubidium has no known biological role, but may help stimulate metabolism, and, similarly to caesium, replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency. Partial substitution is quite possible and rather non-toxic: a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of rubidium, {{and an increase in}} this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. Rats can survive up to 50% substitution of potassium by rubidium. Rubidium (and <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> lesser extent caesium) can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia; while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems, caesium is never able to do so. There is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for rubidium being possibly essential in goats; even if this is true, the trace amounts usually present in food are more than enough.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} run, the Navy {{decided to move}} the Chance Vought factory from Stratford, Connecticut <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> larger facility in Dallas, Texas which had been vacant {{since the end of}} World War II; this badly disrupted {{the production}} of the Pirate. The airframes were built in Stratford and trucked to Dallas where government-furnished equipment, such as the engines and afterburners, were installed. The completed aircraft were then taxied around the new plant's airfield, but the runway was deemed too short to handle jets. The aircraft had to be disassembled and trucked to an abandoned airfield at Ardmore, Oklahoma with a runway long enough for acceptance testing.|$|E

5|$|In February 2008, Paramount {{announced}} they would move Star Trek from its December 25, 2008 release date to May 8, 2009, as the studio felt more people {{would see the}} film during summer than winter. The film was practically finished {{by the end of}} 2008. Paramount's decision came about after visiting the set and watching dailies, as they realized the film could appeal <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> broader audience. Even though the filmmakers liked the Christmas release date, Damon Lindelof acknowledged it would allow more time to perfect the visual effects. The months-long gap between the completion of the production and release meant Alan Dean Foster was allowed to watch the whole film before writing the novelization, although the novel would contain scenes absent from the final edit. Quinto narrated the audiobook.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{wings are}} {{fundamental}} in identifying and classifying species {{as there is}} no other set of structures in studying insects more significant. Each order and insect family has distinctive wing shapes and features. In many cases, even species may be distinguished from each other by differences of color and pattern. For example, just by position one can identify species, albeit <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> lesser extent. Though most insects fold their wings when at rest, dragonflies and some damselflies rest with their wings spread out horizontally, while groups such as the caddisflies, stoneflies, alderflies, and lacewings hold their wings sloped roof-like over their backs. A few moths wrap their wings around their bodies, while many flies and most butterflies close their wings together straight upward over the back.|$|E

5|$|Marine mammals were hunted by coastal {{aboriginal}} humans historically {{for food}} and other resources. These subsistence hunts still occur in Canada, Greenland, Indonesia, Russia, the United States, and several nations in the Caribbean. The effects of these are only localized, as hunting efforts were on a relatively small scale. Commercial hunting took this <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> greater scale and marine mammals were heavily exploited. This led to the extinction of the †Steller's sea cow (along with subsistence hunting) and the †Caribbean monk seal. Today, populations of species that were historically hunted, such as blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and the North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica), are much lower than their pre-whaling levels. Because whales generally have slow growth rates, are slow to reach sexual maturity, and have a low reproductive output, population recovery has been very slow.|$|E
5|$|On February 8, 1992, the Ulysses solar probe flew past Jupiter's {{north pole}} at a {{distance}} of 451,000km. This swing-by maneuver was required for Ulysses to attain a very high-inclination orbit around the Sun, increasing its inclination to the ecliptic to 80.2 degrees. The giant planet's gravity bent the spacecraft's flightpath downward and away from the ecliptic plane, placing it into a final orbit around the Sun's north and south poles. The size and shape of the probe's orbit were adjusted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> smaller degree, so that its aphelion remained at approximately 5AU (Jupiter's distance from the Sun), while its perihelion lay somewhat beyond 1AU (Earth's distance from the Sun). During its Jupiter encounter, the probe made measurements of the planet's magnetosphere. Since the probe had no cameras, no images were taken. In February 2004, the probe arrived again at the vicinity of Jupiter. This time the distance from the planet was much greater—about 240 million km—but it made further observations of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Prague-born Wilhelm Steinitz {{beginning}} in 1873 described {{how to avoid}} weaknesses in one's own position and how to create and exploit such weaknesses in the opponent's position. The scientific approach and positional understanding of Steinitz revolutionized the game. Steinitz {{was the first to}} break a position down into its components. Before Steinitz, players brought their queen out early, did not completely develop their other pieces, and mounted a quick attack on the opposing king, which either succeeded or failed. The level of defense was poor and players did not form any deep plan. In addition to his theoretical achievements, Steinitz founded an important tradition: his triumph over the leading German master Johannes Zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship. Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> younger player, the German mathematician Emanuel Lasker, who maintained this title for 27years, the longest tenure of all World Champions.|$|E

5|$|Relatively {{inactive}} during daytime, the sparsely-spotted stingaree preys {{mainly on}} crustaceans, and <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> lesser extent on polychaete worms {{and other small}} benthic organisms. It is aplacental viviparous, with the mother provisioning her young with histotroph ("uterine milk"). Life history differs between the eastern and western subpopulations: eastern females bear litters of up to six pups with a twelve-month gestation period, while western females bear litters of {{only one or two}} pups with a ten-month gestation period. Also, western rays mature later and live longer than eastern rays. The venomous sting of the sparsely-spotted stingaree is potentially injurious to humans, and it has been reported to react aggressively if disturbed. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern, as there is little fishing activity over the majority of its range.|$|E
5|$|Scholar-officials {{who entered}} civil service through {{examinations}} acted as executive officials <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> larger body of non-ranked personnel called lesser functionaries. They outnumbered officials by four to one; Charles Hucker estimates {{that they were}} {{perhaps as many as}} 100,000 throughout the empire. These lesser functionaries performed clerical and technical tasks for government agencies. Yet they {{should not be confused with}} lowly lictors, runners, and bearers; lesser functionaries were given periodic merit evaluations like officials and after nine years of service might be accepted into a low civil service rank. The one great advantage of the lesser functionaries over officials was that officials were periodically rotated and assigned to different regional posts and had to rely on the good service and cooperation of the local lesser functionaries.|$|E
