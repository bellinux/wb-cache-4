60|$|A {{review of}} the counts in the {{indictment}} I have brought against private medical practice will show that they arise out of the doctor's position as a competitive private tradesman: that is, out of his poverty and dependence. And it should be borne in mind that doctors are expected to treat other people specially well whilst themselves submitting to specially inconsiderate treatment. The butcher and baker {{are not expected to}} feed the hungry unless the hungry can pay; but a doctor who allows a fellow-creature to suffer or perish without aid is regarded as a monster. Even if we must dismiss hospital service as really venal, the fact remains that most doctors do a good deal of gratuitous work in private practice all through their careers. And in his paid work the doctor is on a different footing to the tradesman. Although the articles he sells, advice and treatment, are the same for all classes, his fees have to be graduated like the income tax. The successful fashionable doctor may weed his poorer patients out from time to time, and finally use the College of Physicians to place it out of his own power to accept low fees; but the ordinary general practitioner never makes out his bills without considering the <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity</b> of his patients.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper has been to {{quantify}} and discuss the implications of implicit taxes in Pakistan's agriculture. The methodology of the paper consisted of defining the import and export parity prices of major agricultural commodities grown in Pakistan, by comparing them with domestic procurement prices. Although the analysis covered only four commodities, implicit tax rates in some of the years from 1970 - 71 to 1989 - 90 were as high as 75 percent for certain commodities. It was only in the case of IRRI rice and sugarcane that domestic prices were above the world levels in some years of the period under consideration. When shown {{as a percentage of the}} value-added by agriculture, the taxes on these four commodities, net of the total budgetary subsidies on agricultural inputs, varied from 1. 9 percent to 14. 9 percent. These tax rates in agriculture compared favourably with the overall tax rates in Pakistan's economy for most of the years. Judged in the light of the relative <b>taxable</b> <b>capacities</b> of agriculture and Pakistan's economy as a whole, implicit taxes were much higher in agriculture than in the other sectors of the economy. ...|$|R

He sits in his chair. He has got three men {{generally}} with him. On his right is perhaps Mr. Cook, on his left is Mr. Ayyar, and in front of him Mr. Sim. Then he asks, ' How much do these people require ? ' They say, * Oh, this year they want 80 crores 1 of rupees only from taxation'. 'Is that so ? What did they have last year ?' '64 crores.' ' Very well. Give me a copy of the Tariff Act, a copy of the Income Tax Act, and a copy of the Opium and the Salt Acts and a blue pencil.' He takes the blue pencil in his hands and says, ' Here, 11 per cent on this. No. I will put 15 per cent. That will give us 2 crores. Is that not so, Mr. Cook ?' * Yes, approximately that.' Mr. Sim then says, (Income Tax has been rather sterile these last few years. We will try a little super tax on something,' and he adds on something to the super tax. Then he goes through the Opium and Salt Acts, and the same process goes on until he thinks he has secured the additional sixteen crores. I submit that this is not the way in which, any longer, the Indian Budget ought to be prepared. Every country in the world has, at definite periods, undertaken an examination of the taxation of the country with reference to the <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity</b> of the people. They have got figures and they study all the conditions with reference to the requirements of the country. I maintain that though the Finance Department claims to know everything, they have got no data upon which they can determine the taxation with reference to the <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity</b> of the people.

40|$|An {{effective}} {{tax system}} is fundamental for successful country development. The {{first step to}} understand public revenue systems is to establish some commonly agreed performance measurements and benchmarks. This paper employs a cross-country study to estimate tax capacity from a sample of 104 countries during 1994 - 2003. The estimation results are then used as benchmarks to compare <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity</b> and tax effort in different countries. <b>Taxable</b> <b>capacity</b> refersto the predicted tax-gross domestic product ratio that can be estimated with the regression, taking into account a country's specific economic, demographic, and institutional features. Tax effort is defined as an index of the ratio between {{the share of the}} actual tax collection in gross domestic product and the predicted <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity.</b> The authors classify countries into four distinct groups by their level of actual tax collection and attained tax effort. This classification is based on the benchmark of the global average of tax collection and a tax effort index of 1 (when tax collection is exactly the same as the estimated <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity).</b> The analysis provides guidance for countries with various levels of tax collection and tax effort.

The main motivation {{of the study is}} the need to diversify the sources of the Libyan economy. To this end the thesis presents a conceptual framework for tax burden, excess of tax burden, theory of optimal taxation, concept of <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity,</b> concept of tax effort. The framework is used to reviews the developments of the Libyan economy and the impact on tax effort. The thesis has explored several aspect of tax performance in Libya. First, it analyses the trends of public revenues, public revenues, public spending in final stances of the government. Second, it studies the tax structure and the relative importance of tax sources through the analysis of marginal propensity to tax and the income elasticity of taxes. Third, it examines the evolution of Libya's tax system particularly the income tax system. Finally, various econometrics models such OLS regression, Ordinary ridge regression, and Unbiased ridge regression are used to measure the tax performance such as tax burden, tax effort and tax capacity using time series data covering 1970 to 2000, and panel data covering 2001 to 2007. A fixed and random effect model are used to compare if the determinants of Libya’s tax efforts differs from that of a range of selected oil producing countries. These countries are: Algeria, Argentina, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Cameroon, Chad, Chile, Colombia, Republic of Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Ecuador, Egypt, Emirates, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guyana, Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Kuwait, Lesotho, Libya, Mauritania, Nigeria, Oman, Peru, Saudi, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Venezuela, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe. This research consists of seven chapters: Chapter One provides a background; Chapter Two provides the literature review; Chapter Three 4 gives a brief overview of the development of the Libyan economy, while in Chapter Four there is a description of the public finances in Libya; this is followed in Chapter Five by a review of the tax system in Libya; Chapter Six presents the study’s analyses and findings; Chapter Seven provides the conclusions and recommendations. The main findings of this research are: First, in Libya, tax burden per capita is high; Second, the tax bases in Libya were narrow reflecting the government's heavy reliance on oil revenue; Third, the level of <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity</b> in Libya is also low compared to the selected oil producing countries for a variety of reasons, including: narrow tax bases, failure to diversify the tax sources, and the public sector being subject to tax. The argument is presented that the Libyan economy has reached the full utilization of its <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity.</b> In addition, the study found that the following factors have a major positive impact on Libya's <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity</b> and tax effort: the national product of the service sector, money supply, level of business freedom, level of economic freedom, currency in circulation and tax penalties. In contrast, two factors are found to be negatively affecting the <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity</b> and tax effort in Libya: non-oil exports, oil revenues. The contributions of this study to the literature are twofold: first, this is {{the first of its kind}} to provide comprehensive analyses of Libya’s tax performance; Second, it has added some new variables such as oil revenues, non-oil exports, currency in circulation, money supply(M 1), and tax penalties in testing the determinants of tax effort into the model built by previous researchers.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explores the}} {{structure}} of Ireland’s tax system. Considerable attention is given to GDP and GNP as measures of Ireland’s <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity</b> but how appropriate are either of these measures given {{the structure of}} Ireland’s economy and how does the structure compare internationally? The paper also examines the distribution of income tax and the threshold for the top marginal rate {{as a percentage of}} the average wage and identifies Ireland as an outlier internationally in terms of the rapid progression to the highest marginal rate. Consideration is then given to the microeconomic and macroeconomic impacts of various forms of tax what lessons emerge from the literature in terms of growth enhancing reforms to the overall tax structures and how that might apply to Ireland. The results of simulations suggest permanent increases in GDP and employment from a revenue neutral shift from labour to consumption or property taxes. ...|$|E

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the {{challenge}} of boosting savings is of great importance if Egypt was to sustain the achieved growth rate and increase its investment rate. This paper studies the role of financial liberalization in stimulating savings, investment and growth, with reference to the Egypt. The growth of output of any economy depends on capital accumulation, which in turn requires investment and an equivalent amount of saving to match it. Two of the most important issues in development economics, and for developing countries, are how to stimulate investment, and how to bring about an increase in the level of saving to fund increased investment. The paper tackled the issue of foreign saving and the conditions that need to be met for borrowing from abroad. Findings of the paper indicate the low level of savings in relations to the standard of living. If Egypt is to continue to grow at over 5 percent per annum without such reliance on foreign borrowing, then a major challenge is to raise the level of domestic saving ratio. In terms of involuntary saving, which mainly depends on tax efforts, Egypt’s tax effort is good by international standards, and it is possible that the country may have reached its <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity</b> in relation to its current level of development. The study makes some reservations on forced saving resulting from inflation initiated by monetary expansion. With regards to foreign saving, it nearly doubled Egypt's growth rate compared with what it would have been if investment had been constrained to the level of domestic saving. ...|$|E

Empirical observation, however, suggests universal-ity or near-universality, even in programs that are potentially discrimina-tory.

Weingast and others have argued that working legislatures will implicitly adopt quasi-unanimity rules or con-ventions. We present an alternative model of distributive majoritarian politics. The distinctive feature is "common access. " If democratic poli-tics is modeled, not in terms of a monolithic decision structure, but instead as a setting where differing and separate decision authorities are granted access to the general <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity,</b> collective action can be analyzed in the logic of common resource usage. Our model allows for universality, even with pork-barrel spending, without resort to institu-tionalized rules or informal conventions. "Democracy, " generically understood, embodies majority rule as a central feature, both in the electoral selection of agents and in the processes through which these agents generate outcomes in legislative assemblies. The basic rational-choice logic of majority rule embodies discriminatory separation between majorities and minorities and, unless constitutional constraints are interposed, this logic implies differentiation among levels of benefits and harms accruing to or imposed on those impacted by collective action. Empirical observation of patterns of outcomes generated by legislatures sug-gests, however, that the discrimination derived from rational-choice models does not seem descriptive.

40|$|Purpose – A tax {{based on}} land value {{is in many}} ways ideal, but many economists dismiss it by {{assuming}} it could not raise enough revenue. Standard sources of data omit much of the potential tax base, and undervalue what they do measure. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present more comprehensive and accurate measures of land rents and values, and several modes of raising revenues from them besides the conventional property tax. Design/methodology/approach – The paper identifies 16 elements of land's <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity</b> that received authorities either trivialize or omit. These 16 elements come in four groups. Findings – In Group A, Elements 1 - 4 correct for the downward bias in standard sources. In Group B, Elements 5 - 10 broaden the concepts of land and rent beyond the conventional narrow perception, while Elements 11 - 12 estimate rents to be gained by abating other kinds of taxes. In Group C, Elements 13 - 14 explain how using the land tax, since it has no excess burden, uncaps feasible tax rates. In Group D, Elements 15 - 16 define some moot possibilities that may warrant further exploration. Originality/value – This paper shows how previous estimates of rent and land values have been narrowly limited to a fraction of the whole, thus giving a false impression that the tax capacity is low. The paper adds 14 elements to the traditional narrow “single tax” base, plus two moot elements advanced for future consideration. Any one of these 16 elements indicates a much higher land tax base than economists commonly recognize today. Taken together they are overwhelming, and cast an entirely new light on this subject.

40|$|Demand for {{increased}} public expenditure due to enhanced political consciousness {{and implementation of}} investment programmes through mechanism(s) infected with diseconomies are the two important forces among several others to put increased pressure on the fiscal resources available within a state. Short-term measures undertaken by a Sate viz., dependence on federal transfers and resorting to overdraft evidently has their respective detrimental implications on fiscal health of the state. The remedial approach pervasively suggested by the contemporary fiscal strategists to tackle the ever-increasing fiscal gap moves towards attaining an appropriate degree of financial self reliance. Thus, the obvious solution of fiscal restructuring dwells on an in-depth understanding of the fiscal system of a state particularly on a temporal analysis of the indicators that throw light {{on the performance of}} a tax system in respect of two objectives: (i) siphoning off into the state exchequer the collection of revenue without endangering the incentive for private savings and investment and (ii) helping to release resources for private investment by reducing private consumption. While the indicators like the compound growth rate and marginal tax rates do not take in to account the <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity,</b> the tax ratio and the tax efforts measures generally fail to indicate the responsiveness of the tax structure to changes in state’s income over time. Thus the temporal analysis of tax responsiveness in terms of Elasticity and Buoyancy becomes imperative to have an evaluative insight into the effectiveness of a state’s tax system. The present study is an attempt in this regard by taking the States of North Eastern Region for the period 1963 - 64 to 2000 - 01. The study reveals that most of the States in the region have failed miserably in mobilizing resources to meet ever increasing public expenditures and thereby are suffering from dependency syndromes.

40|$|Australia {{does not}} have either an annual net wealth tax or a tax on gifts and inheritances. In this study the {{taxation}} of wealth is reviewed. The {{focus is on the}} annual net wealth tax, although death taxes also receive some consideration. Drawing on first principles of taxation, the taxation of wealth is examined according to the key criteria for judging tax systems: equity, efficiency, administration and revenue. A comprehensive system of taxing income includes all accretions to wealth, including gifts and bequests. Therefore a separate tax on wealth is necessary if inheritances and gifts are excluded from an income tax system. There are also strong grounds for taxing wealth to achieve horizontal and vertical equity between taxpayers. As well as income earned from wealth, all other benefits that result from wealth ownership represent <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity.</b> Wealth taxes cause efficiency costs by distorting the choices of individuals. As with other taxes such as income and consumption taxes, there is a trade-off between achieving objectives of equity and efficiency. Investigation of the real incidence of wealth taxes reveals that wealth taxes, in the long run, may be borne in part by consumers and by co-factors of production such as labour, as well as by owners of capital. Evidence from the Western European countries that successfully operate an annual net wealth tax indicates that a wealth tax is no more difficult to administer than an income tax. Wealth taxes make a relatively small contribution to the tax revenue of countries that implement them. The potential revenue from an Australian wealth tax would also be relatively small. There is considerable, and it seems increasing, inequality in the distribution of wealth and income in Australia. An objective of wealth taxation is to redress some of the inequality in the distribution of national wealth. Overall, the taxation of wealth is a fundamental part of a balanced tax system.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the growth}} of UK public social and welfare spending (PSS) for 1830 - 1950 {{on the basis of}} a specially constructed dataset, itself a major resource for further research. The data are summarised to establish trends over two sub-periods, 1830 - 90, and 1890 - 50, with testing and assessment of specific explanations for observed trends and fluctuations, with an emphasis on economic and fiscal explanations. These hypotheses are selected from the literature for public spending in general, and social spending in particular. The data are provided in comprehensive worksheets, annualised for the whole period by financial and calendar year, at current and constant prices, disaggregated by territory and programme, and further broken down into seven aspects. The complete data are contained in a separate CD with a linked summary of these data. A summary of sources is in the appendix. Trends are established for each programme and total public social spending from these data. On this basis the central research thesis is tested, that the economic and fiscal explanations add substantially to the standard explanations of the current historiography. A number of the most common non-economic explanations are assessed also for the same two sub periods, 1830 - 90 and 1890 - 1950. Chapter one considers previous work, the database's sources, the difficulties in assembling it and its reliability, a genealogy of terms and definitions, general methodology, and the periodisation adopted. Chapter two provides a review of possible explanations of PSS changes and the selection of the non-economic and economic explanations. The following two chapters, for the two periods, 1830 - 90 and 1890 - 1950, have a common format in which the narrative political history is followed by sections on basic economic trends and the economic impact of public finances. Public social and welfare spending is then discussed by programme, aspect and territory. A summary of the findings for the selected hypotheses concludes each of these chapters. Chapter five draws together the main conclusions. Some political hypotheses are not supported, at least not in their original specifications. The role of non-public social spending, the local-central tensions and the importance of <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity</b> are emphasised. Amongst the economic hypotheses, several are not supported, but Wagner's Law, the Baumol effect, the argument from market and government failure, the close connection between labour market interventions and welfare spending, and the close relation to national debt reduction, add explanatory value for at least one of these sub-periods. These hypotheses may be related, but no single, over-arching explanation is possible, although a final diagram (Figure 5. 5) is offered as a possible schematic of the major forces explaining PSS trendsEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the key economic factors that shape tax policy reform in many high-income countries, developing countries, and/or transition economies. The paper describes and evaluates global and regional developments with respect to tax rates and revenue ratios over the last some 20 years, and discusses selected structural reform initiatives that have been high on the policy agenda over this period. In particular, it focuses on developments relating to experiments with the restructuring of corporate tax, the impact of corporate taxes on FDI, key reform initiatives including dual income taxes and flat taxes, as well as the worldwide spread of the VAT and policy developments associated with climate change and natural resource taxation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} critically examines predominant political-economic {{theories of}} public credit and public debt {{in light of}} the origins, development, and recent record expansion in such debt. Using a "history of thought" approach, I focus on those aspects of theory, from three main schools of thought - Classical, Keynesian, and Public Choice - which seek to explain the evolution of public debt, its political-economic causes and effects, the meaning of sustainability in public debt burdens, and the conditions under which governments are likely to monetize or repudiate their debts. For empirical context, I also provide three centuries of data on public debt for major nations, relative to their national income, and government bond-yield data for more recent decades. There is value in classifying the major political economists who have examined public credit and public debt since 1700 as "pessimists," "optimists" or "realists. " Public debt pessimists argue that government provides no truly productive services, that its taxing and borrowing detract from the private economy, while unfairly burdening future generations, and that high and rising public leverage ratios are unsustainable and will likely cause national insolvency and long-term economic ruin. When public debts become excessive or un-payable, pessimists advise explicit default or deliberate repudiation. Public debt pessimists also believe financiers in general and public bondholders in particular are unproductive. Pessimists usually endorse smaller-sized governments and free markets. With few exceptions, most public debt pessimists appear in the Classical or Public Choice schools of thought. Among prominent public debt pessimists, the most representative are David Hume and Adam Smith. Public debt optimists believe that government provides not only productive services, such as infrastructure and social insurance, but means to mitigate what they perceived to be "market failures," including savings gluts, economic depressions, inflation, and secular stagnation. Optimists contend that deficit-spending and public debt accumulation can stimulate or sustain economy activity and ensure full employment, without burdening present or future generation. To the extent public debts become excessive or un-payable, optimists tend to advise implicit default, by official and deliberate debasement of the national currency (inflation). As do pessimists, public debt optimists view financiers and bondholders as essentially unproductive. Optimists also defend a relatively larger economic role for the state. Almost without exception, optimists reside in the Keynesian school of political-economic thought. Among the leading optimists, the most representative are Alvin Hansen and Abba Lerner. Public debt realists contend that government can and should provide certain productive services, mainly national defense, police protection, courts of justice, and basic infrastructure, but that social and redistributive schemes tend to undermine national prosperity. Realists say public debt should fund only services and projects that help a free economy maximize its potential, and that analysis must be contextualized - i. e., related to a nation's credit capacity, productivity, and <b>taxable</b> <b>capacity.</b> According to realists, public leverage is neither inevitably harmful, as pessimists say, nor infinite, as optimists say. Realists view financiers as productive and insist that sovereigns redeem their public debts in full, on time, and in sound money. Realists favor constitutionally-limited yet energetic governments that help promote robust markets. They appear mainly in the Classical era of political-economic thought. The most representative and renowned of the public debt realists are Sir James Steuart and Alexander Hamilton. My main thesis is that public debt realists provide the most persuasive theories of public credit and public debt, and thus the most plausible interpretations of the long, fascinating history of public debt. Moreover, certain puzzles and paradoxes arising in contemporary public debt experience, among developed nations - including the recent, multi-decade trend of simultaneously rising public-leverage ratios and declining public debt yields - is explicable primarily in realist terms. In contrast, public debt pessimists and optimists alike offer unbalanced, inadequate accounts of public debt experience. Whereas pessimists are too often confused or mistaken in foreseeing an alleged "inevitable" ruin from public debt, optimists more often than not are confused and mistaken about the alleged "stimulus" attainable by large-scale deficit-spending and debt build-ups. Looking ahead, the realist perspective is likely to provide superior guideposts for maximally-accurate interpretations of public debt policies and trends. Dissertatio...|$|E
