This leaves the move 6.Ng1 as the only option, when after six moves neither side has developed a piece. The resulting slightly odd position (diagram) offers White good attacking chances.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the idea}} of space {{vehicles}} shaped like flying saucers was imprinted in the national psyche for many years prior to 1947, when the Roswell incident took place.

25|$|Also, {{an obvious}} riposte {{is that we}} can {{aggregate}} capital simply by using the first set of prices and ignoring the second, as with many inflation corrections. This does not work, however, because the variation of the rate of profit is theorized as happening at a specific point in time in purely mathematical terms rather than as part of an historical process. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if neoclassical conceptions do not work at a specific time (statics), they cannot handle the more complicated issues of dynamics. This critique of the neoclassical conception is more of a matter of pointing out its major technical flaws in the theory than of presenting an alternative.|$|E

25|$|In epistemology, for example, the {{criticism}} of what Fodor calls the interpretationalist hypothesis accounts for the common-sense intuition (on which naïve physics is based) of the independence of reality from the conceptual categories of the experimenter. If the processes of elaboration of the mental modules are in fact independent of the background theories, then {{it is possible to}} maintain the realist view that two scientists who embrace two radically diverse theories see the world exactly in the same manner even if they interpret it differently. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is necessary to distinguish between observations and the perceptual fixation of beliefs. While it is beyond doubt that the second process involves the holistic relationship between beliefs, the first is largely independent of the background beliefs of individuals.|$|E
25|$|Physics is {{the general}} {{analysis}} of nature, conducted {{in order to understand}} how the universe behaves. On the other hand, the study of meteorological weather patterns or human behavior is only of interest to humans themselves. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> having a perspective on the world is a psychological state. Therefore, the special sciences presuppose the existence of minds which can have these states. If one is to avoid ontological dualism, then the mind that has a perspective must be part of the physical reality to which it applies its perspective. If this is the case, then in order to perceive the physical world as psychological, the mind must have a perspective on the physical. This, in turn, presupposes the existence of mind.|$|E
25|$|We {{said this}} movie is a stylized movie, it’s not so {{different}} from the world of a musical. And there were a few other things that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E

25|$|This {{argument}} has been formulated by Paul Churchland, among others. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> in instances {{of some sort}} of brain damage (e.g. caused by automobile accidents, drug abuse, pathological diseases, etc.), it is always the case that the mental substance and/or properties of the person are significantly changed or compromised. If the mind were a completely separate substance from the brain, how could it be possible that every single time the brain is injured, the mind is also injured? Indeed, it is very frequently the case that one can even predict and explain the kind of mental or psychological deterioration or change that human beings will undergo when specific parts of their brains are damaged. So the question for the dualist to try to confront is how can all of this be explained if the mind is a separate and immaterial substance from, or if its properties are ontologically independent of, the brain.|$|E
500|$|We {{are also}} of opinion {{that as the}} right of the {{plaintiff}} to sue was given by, and is dependent upon, the statute, the statute of limitations is a bar to the action. By the act of 1845, the actions thereby authorized are to be brought and maintained ‘in the same time’ as if brought by citizens of the state. The question is not whether an Indian title can be barred by adverse possession, or by state statutes of limitation. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the plaintiff cannot invoke the special remedy given by the statute, without being bound by the conditions upon which it is given.|$|E
500|$|Because {{of these}} influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's {{personal}} style, the media often defined her as punk, something she denied being. Lavigne's {{close friend and}} guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said, [...] "It's a very touchy subject {{to a lot of}} people, but <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene.

Lavigne also commented on the matter: [...] "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [...] rebel... punk, and I am so not any of them." [...] Although she stated to have punk influences on her music: [...] "I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music. I like an aggressive music, but pretty enough heavy pop-rock, which is what I really do." ...|$|E

500|$|Still, Achebe {{seeks to}} portray neither moral absolutes nor a fatalistic inevitability. In 1972, he said: [...] "I never {{will take the}} stand that the Old must win or that the New must win. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no single truth {{satisfied}} me—and this is well founded in the Ibo world view. No single man can be correct all the time, no single idea can be totally correct." [...] His perspective {{is reflected in the}} words of Ikem, a character in Anthills of the Savannah: [...] "whatever you are is never enough; you {{must find a way to}} accept something, however small, from the other to make you whole and to save you from the mortal sin of righteousness and extremism." [...] And in a 1996 interview, Achebe said: [...] "Belief in either radicalism or orthodoxy is too simplified a way of viewing things... Evil is never all evil; goodness on the other hand is often tainted with selfishness." ...|$|E
500|$|Responding to this {{emphasis}} on pleasure, Albert Guerard, Jr. argues that the poem contains a [...] "longing not for art but a free reverie of any kind. The form of the poem is that of progression by association, so that the movement of feeling is {{at the mercy of}} words evoked by chance, such words as fade and forlorn, the very words that, like a bell, toll the dreamer back to his sole self." [...] However, Fogle points out that the terms Guerard emphasizes are [...] "associational translations" [...] and that Guerard misunderstands Keats's aesthetic. After all, the acceptance of the loss of pleasure {{by the end of the}} poem is an acceptance of life and, in turn, of death. Death was a constant theme that permeated aspects of Keats poetry because he was exposed to death of his family members throughout his life. Within the poem, there are many images of death. The nightingale experiences a sort of death and even the god Apollo experiences death, but his death reveals his own divine state. As Perkins explains, [...] "But, of course, the nightingale is not thought to be literally dying. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the deity or the nightingale can sing without dying. But, as the ode makes clear, man cannot—or at least not in a visionary way." ...|$|E
500|$|Greed {{received}} mostly negative reviews. The {{trade paper}} Harrison's Report said that [...] "f a contest {{were to be}} held to determine {{which has been the}} filthiest, vilest, most putrid picture {{in the history of the}} motion picture business, I am sure that Greed would win." [...] Variety Weekly called it [...] "an out-and-out box office flop" [...] only six days after its premiere and claimed that the film had taken two years to shoot, cost $700,000 and was originally 130 reels long. The review went on to say that [...] "nothing more morbid and senseless, from a commercial picture standpoint, has been seen on the screen for a long, long time" [...] and that despite its [...] "excellent acting, fine direction and the undoubted power of its story... it does not entertain." [...] In its December 1924 – January 1925 issue, Exceptional Photoplays called it [...] "one of the most uncompromising films ever shown on the screen. There have already been many criticisms of its brutality, its stark realism, its sordidness. But <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was never intended to be a pleasant picture." [...] In the February 1925 issue of Theatre Magazine, Aileen St. John-Brenon wrote that [...] "the persons in the photoplay are not characters, but types—they are well selected, weighed and completely drilled. But they did not act; they do not come to life. They perform their mission like so many uncouth images of miserliness and repugnant animalism." [...] Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times gave the film a mostly positive review in regards to the acting and directing while criticizing how it was edited, writing that MGM [...] "clipped this production as much as they dared... and are to be congratulated on their efforts and the only pity is that they did not use the scissors more generously in the beginning." [...] In a Life Magazine article, Robert E. Sherwood also defended MGM's cutting of the film and called von Stroheim [...] "a genius... badly in need of a stopwatch." [...] Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) disliked the tinting, saying [...] "a not very pleasing yellow tinge is smudged in." [...] A March 1925 review in Pictureplay magazine stated, [...] "perhaps an American director would not have seen greed as a vice." ...|$|E
