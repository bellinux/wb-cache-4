25|$|Through water {{communications}} systems are {{more suitable for}} scuba as the diver is not encumbered by a communications cable, but they can be fitted to surface supplied equipment if desired. Most through water systems have a Push To Talk (PTT) system, so that high power is only used to <b>transmit</b> <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> when the diver has something to say. For commercial diving applications this is a disadvantage, in that the supervisor can not monitor the condition of the divers by hearing them breathe.|$|E
500|$|On October 22, {{after the}} work of the Commission had ended, Khrushchev invited the delegates to a dinner which, {{according}} to Alia, was used [...] "to threaten those parties which might oppose the line of the Soviets in November." [...] He gave as an example an exchange between Soviet Politburo member Yekaterina Furtseva and Kapo, in which the former asked, [...] "Are you Hysni Kapo?! I've heard so much about you..." [...] Kapo replied, [...] "For good or bad?" [...] to which Furtseva stated, [...] "You have attacked the Soviet Union, but you are heading for trouble on that course," [...] getting [...] "the reply she deserved" [...] from Kapo, with Alia further writing that [...] "her mission was just to <b>transmit</b> <b>the</b> <b>signal.</b> Throughout the whole dinner she did not speak to us again." ...|$|E

50|$|WMT-AM-TV {{were based}} at {{what came to}} be known as Broadcast Park. When the {{facility}} was first built, the surrounding area was still mainly rural. A 702 ft high broadcast tower was built to <b>transmit</b> <b>the</b> <b>signal.</b> This served as the primary tower for the next four years. In 1956, a taller tower in Rowley was built to <b>transmit</b> <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> but a storm on December 10 blew the tower down. This was soon rebuilt and remains in service today. In 1968, the WMT stations (including WMT-FM at 96.5, now KKSY-FM, which signed on in 1963) were sold to the Morton family of Louisville, Kentucky. The familys holdings eventually became known as Orion Broadcasting.|$|E

5000|$|The second {{invention}} used a large {{array of}} photocells and wires to <b>transmit</b> <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> to a visual display made of many individual lights.

50|$|The {{effects of}} fading can be combated by using {{diversity}} to <b>transmit</b> <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> over multiple channels that experience independent fading and coherently combining {{them at the}} receiver.

50|$|Bridgetap - Bridge taps {{within a}} span can be {{detected}} by employing a number of test patterns {{with a variety of}} ones and zeros densities. This test generates 21 test patterns and runs for 15 minutes. If a signal error occurs, the span may have one or more bridge taps. This pattern is only effective for T1 spans that <b>transmit</b> <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> raw. Modulation used in HDSL spans negates the bridgetap patterns' ability to uncover bridge taps.|$|E
50|$|The FCC {{allowed a}} new portion of {{high-frequency}} spectrum to be allocated for WiFi networks in 2003.
