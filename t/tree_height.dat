5|$|The huia's {{movements}} are little known, {{but it was}} most likely sedentary. The huia {{is thought to have}} undertaken seasonal movements, living in montane forests in the summer and moving down into lowland forests in the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes. Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds, the saddleback and the kōkako, the huia was a weak flier and could only fly for short distances, and seldom above <b>tree</b> <b>height.</b> More often it would use its powerful legs to propel it in long leaps and bounds through the canopy or across the forest floor, or it would cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread for balance.|$|E

25|$|At {{the highest}} {{elevations}} is dwarf forest, a dense forest {{as short as}} , on saturated soils. Here the trees are covered with epiphytic mosses and vascular plants, especially bromeliads, and these also cover {{large areas of the}} ground. Ascending the Luquillo Mountains through these forest types, the average <b>tree</b> <b>height</b> and diameter, number of tree species, and basal area (cross sectional area of tree stems) tend to decrease, while stem density increases.|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of our multi-article series is to demonstrate the Allometric Scaling and Resource Limitation (ASRL) approach for mapping <b>tree</b> <b>heights</b> and biomass. This third article tests the feasibility of the optimized ASRL model over China at both site (14 meteorological stations) and continental scales. <b>Tree</b> <b>heights</b> from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) waveform data are used for the model optimizations. Three selected ASRL parameters (area of single leaf, α; exponent for canopy radius, η; and root absorption efficiency, γ) are iteratively adjusted to minimize differences between the references and predicted <b>tree</b> <b>heights.</b> Key climatic variables (e. g., temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation) are needed for the model simulations. We also exploit the independent GLAS and in situ <b>tree</b> <b>heights</b> to examine the model performance. The predicted <b>tree</b> <b>heights</b> at the site scale are evaluated against the GLAS <b>tree</b> <b>heights</b> using a two-fold cross validation (RMSE = 1. 72 m; R 2 = 0. 97) and bootstrapping (RMSE = 4. 39 m; R 2 = 0. 81). The modeled <b>tree</b> <b>heights</b> at the continental scale (1 km spatial resolution) are compared to both GLAS (RMSE = 6. 63 m; R 2 = 0. 63) and in situ (RMSE = 6. 70 m; R 2 = 0. 52) measurements. Further, inter-comparisons against the existing satellite-based forest height maps {{have resulted in a}} moderate degree of agreements. Our results show that the optimized ASRL model is capable of satisfactorily retrieving <b>tree</b> <b>heights</b> over continental China at both scales. Subsequent studies will focus on the estimation of woody biomass after alleviating the discussed limitations...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{to generate}} spatially continuous fields of <b>tree</b> <b>heights</b> with an optimized Allometric Scaling and Resource Limitations (ASRL) model is {{reported in this}} first of a multi-part series of articles. Model optimization is performed with the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) waveform data. This methodology is demonstrated by mapping <b>tree</b> <b>heights</b> over forested lands in the continental USA (CONUS) at 1 km spatial resolution. The study area is divided into 841 eco-climatic zones based on three forest types, annual total precipitation classes (30 mm intervals) and annual average temperature classes (2 &# 176;C intervals). Three model parameters (area of single leaf, &# 945;, exponent for canopy radius, &# 951;, and root absorption efficiency, &# 947;) were selected for optimization, that is, to minimize the difference between actual and potential <b>tree</b> <b>heights</b> {{in each of the}} eco-climatic zones over the CONUS. <b>Tree</b> <b>heights</b> predicted by the optimized model were evaluated against GLAS heights using a two-fold cross validation approach (R 2 = 0. 59; RMSE = 3. 31 m). Comparison at the pixel level between GLAS heights (mean = 30. 6 m; standard deviation = 10. 7) and model predictions (mean = 30. 8 m; std. = 8. 4) were also performed. Further, the model predictions were compared to existing satellite-based forest height maps. The optimized ASRL model satisfactorily reproduced the pattern of <b>tree</b> <b>heights</b> over the CONUS. Subsequent articles in this series will document further improvements with the ultimate goal of mapping <b>tree</b> <b>heights</b> and forest biomass globally...|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{division}} of the plane is decided by the order of point-insertion, the <b>tree's</b> <b>height</b> is sensitive to and dependent on insertion order.

25|$|With rich {{soils and}} good {{supply of water}} the valley floors are cooler and more humid than {{any other part of}} the park. Large tree species such as Australian cedar (Toona cilliata prev. T. australis) and the larger {{eucalypt}} species dominate. <b>Tree</b> <b>height</b> reach 50 metres or more and a rich understory of fern, wattles, and other medium-size plants proliferate. Some small areas are classified as temperate rainforest. These areas are characterized by dense groves of very large trees including the iconic Port Jackson fig (Ficus rubiginosa) and Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla) trees. The absence of light leads to a lack of undergrowth other than a profusion of ferns. These are among the more popular areas for visitors to the park. The park service is also very careful to protect these areas due to their general rarity in the hot, arid Australian landscape.|$|E

Despite losing its national title, the sycamore remained the largest American sycamore in West Virginia. Following a 1963 survey of large trees in West Virginia, the Webster Sycamore was named the second-largest tree after a white oak (Quercus alba) in Randolph County.|$|E

30|$|Using {{the forest}} {{simulation}} framework WaldPlaner 2.1 (Hansen and Nagel 2014) 2007 forest stands with individual trees are generated {{based on the}} provided stand information, i.e. for every species and for each layer values on age, quadratic mean diameter, and volume per hectare as well as species proportions and stocking degree. Single <b>tree</b> <b>heights</b> are estimated site-sensitively applying the height-diameter model. These initial <b>tree</b> <b>heights</b> are further updated in each 5 -year prediction period with newly predicted values from the height-diameter model. As the survey data has different inventory dates all stands are projected to 2010 as a uniform starting year for the growth projections.|$|R
40|$|In Central Amazonian white-water {{floodplains}} (várzea), different forest types become {{established in}} relation to the flood-level gradient. The formations are characterized by typical patterns of species composition, and their architecture can be quantified using large-scale aerial photography. Crown sizes, <b>tree</b> <b>heights,</b> the projected crown area coverage and the gap frequencies influence the light reflectance in the upper canopy, and provide information which facilitates a classification of different forest types by satellite imagery. Results of ground analysis indicate that at the average flood-level of 3 m, species diversity and architecture of the forests changes, thus justify the classification into the categories of low várzea (várzea baixa) and high várzea (várzea alta). The structure of low várzea depends on the successional stage, and species diversity increases with increasing age of the formations. Within the early successional stages of low várzea, a homogeneous, nonstratified canopy is developped, with uniform <b>tree</b> <b>heights</b> and crown extensions, resulting in a smooth canopy surface. Gap frequency is low. Therefore, these forests show a simple behaviour pattern in pixel distribution and are easy to detect, when scanned by TM images. In subsequent successional stages, <b>tree</b> <b>heights</b> and crown areas increase, and an initial stratification is developed. Gap frequency tends to increase with increasing age of the formations. In high várzea, only one successional stage was found and species diversity is higher than in all low-várzea formations. <b>Tree</b> <b>heights</b> reach 45 m and stratification is well defined. The more complex architecture of the high várzea results in the most diffuse behaviour patterns of pixel distribution, when scanned by TM image dat...|$|R

50|$|Keidelheim is home {{to three}} notable oak trees. The Assmannseiche is named for the house on whose lot it {{originally}} stood (Assmann was the family’s name, and eiche means “oak” in German). It {{is believed to have}} been planted in 1780. The <b>tree’s</b> <b>height</b> is 25 m, its circumference at chest height is 370 cm and its crown has a diameter of 30 m. The Bismarckeiche was planted in 1890 in the then Imperial Chancellor’s honour. The <b>tree’s</b> <b>height</b> is 21 m, its circumference at chest height is 295 cm and its crown has a diameter of 22 m. The Keidelheimer Dorfeiche (“Village Oak”) or Wappeneiche (“Heraldic Oak”) stands as a charge in the municipality’s coat of arms. It is found in a meadow just before the forest on the way out of the village to the barbecue pits. If the village chronicle is to be believed, it is more than one thousand years old. Since the oak stands in a spot that was once a much broader expanse of meadowland, it is assumed that it was once used as a sheltering <b>tree.</b> The <b>tree’s</b> <b>height</b> is 21 m, its circumference at chest height is 500 cm and its crown has a diameter of 23 m.
