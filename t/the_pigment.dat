5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are purple-brown to brown. Viewed with a microscopic, the spores appear purple, angular with lobes, and warted, with fine spines {{measuring}} 0.5–1.5µm long; the overall {{dimensions of the}} elliptic spores are 8–12 by 7–9µm. They contain one or two oil drops. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 70–100 by 9–12µm, and have sterigmata that are 2–4µm thick by 7–12µm long. The flesh stains deep blue when a drop of potassium hydroxide solution is applied. The fungus contains <b>the</b> <b>pigment</b> thelephoric acid.|$|E
5|$|The Romans had {{a greater}} {{appreciation}} for the color green; it {{was the color of}} Venus, the goddess of gardens, vegetables and vineyards. The Romans made a fine green earth pigment that was widely used in the wall paintings of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Lyon, Vaison-la-Romaine, and other Roman cities. They also used <b>the</b> <b>pigment</b> verdigris, made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine. By the second century AD, the Romans were using green in paintings, mosaics and glass, and there were ten different words in Latin for varieties of green.|$|E

5000|$|Consolidation is {{a process}} that can either {{strengthen}} <b>the</b> bond between <b>pigment</b> and parchment or add protection to pigments and other finishes from aqueous treatments.

5|$|The {{photostability}} of pigments can {{be enhanced}} {{by the addition of}} cerium. It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass plates are subject to electron bombardment, which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also an essential component of phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C. <b>The</b> <b>pigment</b> is a nontoxic alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is {{a common}} {{defensive}} mechanism in frogs. Most camouflaged frogs are nocturnal; during the day, they seek out {{a position where they}} can blend into the background and remain undetected. Some frogs have the , but this is usually restricted to a small range of colours. For example, White's tree frog (Litoria caerulea) varies between pale green and dull brown according to the temperature, and the Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) has green and brown morphs, plain or spotted, and changes colour depending on the time of year and general background colour. Features such as warts and skin folds are usually on ground-dwelling frogs, for whom smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage. Certain frogs change colour between night and day, as light and moisture stimulate <b>the</b> <b>pigment</b> cells and cause them to expand or contract.|$|E
5|$|Collected in deposit, {{like with}} a spore print, the spores of T.plumbeoviolaceus {{appear to be}} a light pink to flesh color. When viewed with a light microscope, they are elliptical, with smooth walls and {{dimensions}} of 9.1–12.3 by 3.4–4.5µm. The basidia (cellular structures that produce the spores) are club-shaped, and measure about 26 by 6.5µm. The cuticle of the cap (the pileipellis) is made of a tangle of smooth-walled, narrow, brownish hyphae. When stained in potassium hydroxide, the hyphal contents tend to form beads, while staining in Melzer's reagent causes <b>the</b> <b>pigment</b> to form globules. Cystidia are common in the hymenial tissue; they are swollen at the base and narrow at the apex (lageniform), measuring 30–40µm long by 7–9µm thick. Clamp connections are absent in the hyphae.|$|E
40|$|Picogram {{quantities}} of norepinephrine {{were found in}} cochlear regions of pigmented and non-pigmented rats. These regions of the cochlea were the modiolus, organ of Corti-osseous spiral lamina and the lateral cochlear wall. The content of norepinephrine in the modiolus and lateral cochlear wall of <b>the</b> <b>pigmented</b> rat was significantly greater than that {{in areas of the}} non-pigmented rat. In contrast, there was no statistical difference between the norepinephrine content of the organ of Corti-osseous spiral lamina region of <b>the</b> <b>pigmented</b> rat and that of the albino rat. Since a major difference between <b>the</b> <b>pigmented</b> and albino rats is the presence of melanin-containing melanocytes in the modiolus and lateral cochlear wall region of <b>the</b> <b>pigmented</b> animals, it is possible that norepinephrine is stored in cochlear melanocytes...|$|R

5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by the bright red pigment in the thallus. <b>The</b> <b>pigment,</b> first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains calcium oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite, a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} calcium oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments, and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain, bird droppings, and airborne particles.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there is}} no attempt by the artist to soften the subject's {{brutality}} through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically morbid theme. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors are restricted to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of <b>the</b> <b>pigment</b> itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish. Few would admire the work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.|$|E
5|$|Gills are adnate with a decurrent tooth (where {{the gills}} curve up {{to join the}} stipe but then, close to the stipe, the margin turns down again), and {{initially}} narrow but broaden when old. They are pallid to grayish-olive with bright orange edges. Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens, because <b>the</b> <b>pigment,</b> rather than being encrusted {{on the walls of}} the cystidia, is found in the cytosol and therefore more readily diffusible. The gills are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe, and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stipe).|$|E
40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{substantiate}} the conditions for synthesis of <b>the</b> <b>pigments</b> with increased chromatic, mechanical, physical-chemical, thermic and operating properties and to develop the new energy-saving technology of their production. The new conditions for synthesis of <b>the</b> <b>pigments</b> with increased qualities have been substantiated, the new mechanic-chemical conception of the activation at "dry" procedure of the charge preparation that provided the special-strength initial physical-chemical bonds has been proposed. <b>The</b> <b>pigments</b> possessing <b>the</b> high commercial competitive power at production of the glaze covers for ceramics and other building materials have been created.

5|$|She {{observed}} {{the effects of}} the transposition of Ac and Ds by the changing patterns of coloration in maize kernels over generations of controlled crosses, and described {{the relationship between the two}} loci through intricate microscopic analysis. She concluded that Ac controls the transposition of the Ds from chromosome9, and that the movement of Ds is accompanied by the breakage of the chromosome. When Ds moves, the aleurone-color gene is released from the suppressing effect of the Ds and transformed into the active form, which initiates <b>the</b> <b>pigment</b> synthesis in cells. The transposition of Ds in different cells is random, it may move in some but not others, which causes color mosaicism. The size of the colored spot on the seed is determined by stage of the seed development during dissociation. McClintock also found that the transposition of Ds is determined by the number of Ac copies in the cell.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of terns cannot {{accommodate}} under water, so {{they rely}} on accurate sighting from the air before they plunge-dive. Like other seabirds that feed at the surface or dive for food, terns have red oil droplets in the cones of their retinas; birds that have to look through an air/water interface have more deeply coloured carotenoid pigments in the oil drops than other species. <b>The</b> <b>pigment</b> also improves visual contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions, and helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or other feeding birds. The red colouring reduces ultraviolet sensitivity, which in any case is an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls, and this protects the eye from UV damage.|$|E
5|$|The skin colour of {{amphibians}} {{is produced}} by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores. These three cell layers consist of the melanophores (occupying the deepest layer), the guanophores (forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules, producing a blue-green colour) and the lipophores (yellow, the most superficial layer). The colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland. Unlike bony fish, {{there is no direct}} control of <b>the</b> <b>pigment</b> cells by the nervous system, and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish. A vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators.|$|E

30|$|Cadmium yellow {{pigments}} commonly {{exist as}} solid solutions where zinc, mercury, or selenium substitutions {{can be used}} to change <b>the</b> <b>pigment’s</b> hue. Yellow cadmium sulfides most frequently occur as a solid solution with zinc sulfide as Cd(1 −x)ZnxS [37]. Micro-Raman spectroscopy has been used to identify these solid solutions, which can have implications about <b>the</b> <b>pigment’s</b> stability. <b>The</b> poorly crystalline nature of <b>the</b> cadmium yellow <b>pigments</b> in this work, and the fluorescence of the oil binder led to cadmium yellow pigments being inferred by the presence of cadmium in yellow regions (SEM-EDX and XRF mapping) and <b>the</b> <b>pigment’s</b> characteristic infrared luminescence. Further work by µXPD could be used to determine the lattice parameters indicating the degree of Zn substitution into the crystal lattice.|$|R
5|$|The {{skin of a}} larva is mottled with black, brown, {{and yellow}} pigmentation. Skin color changes as the larvae develop and pigment cells migrate and {{concentrate}} in {{different regions of the}} body. <b>The</b> <b>pigment</b> cells, called chromatophores, are derived from the neural crest. The three types of pigment chromatophores in salamanders include yellow xanthophores, black melanophores, and silvery iridiophores (or guanophores). As the larvae mature, the melanophores concentrate along the body and provide the darker background. The yellow xanthophores arrange along the spine and on top of the limbs. The rest of the body is flecked with reflective iridiophores along the sides and underneath.|$|E
5|$|Various cadmium salts {{are used}} in paint pigments, with CdS as a yellow pigment being the most common. Cadmium {{selenide}} is a red pigment, commonly called cadmium red. To painters who work with <b>the</b> <b>pigment,</b> cadmium provides the most brilliant and durable yellows, oranges, and reds — {{so much so that}} during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into watercolors, gouaches, acrylics, and other paint and pigment formulations.

5|$|When {{cephalopod}} molluscs like squid and cuttlefish {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating <b>the</b> <b>pigment</b> into a smaller area, resulting in a pattern of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light. When they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating a pattern of larger dark spots, and making their bodies appear dark. Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers of their skin. The top layer contains 'xanthophores' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains 'iridophores' with a silvery light-reflecting pigment; while the bottom layer contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century the idea that plants could {{synthesise}} almost all their tissues from atmospheric gases had not yet emerged. The energy component of photosynthesis, the capture and storage of the Sun's radiant energy in carbon bonds (a process on which all life depends) was first elucidated in 1847 by Mayer, but the details of how this was done would take many more years. Chlorophyll was named in 1818 and its chemistry gradually determined, to be finally resolved in the early 20th century. The mechanism of photosynthesis remained a mystery until the mid-19th century when Sachs, in 1862, noted that starch was formed in green cells only in the presence of light and in 1882 he confirmed carbohydrates as the starting point for all other organic compounds in plants. The connection between <b>the</b> <b>pigment</b> chlorophyll and starch production was finally made in 1864 but tracing the precise biochemical pathway of starch formation did not begin until about 1915.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, a {{significant}} part of the world's production of cobalt blue (a dye made with cobalt compounds and alumina) and smalt (cobalt glass powdered for use for pigment purposes in ceramics and painting) was carried out at the Norwegian Blaafarveværket. The first mines for the production of smalt in the 16th century were located in Norway, Sweden, Saxony and Hungary. With the discovery of cobalt ore in New Caledonia in 1864, the mining of cobalt in Europe declined. With the discovery of ore deposits in Ontario, Canada in 1904 and the discovery of even larger deposits in the Katanga Province in the Congo in 1914, the mining operations shifted again. When the Shaba conflict started in 1978, the copper mines of Katanga Province nearly stopped production. The impact on the world cobalt economy from this conflict was smaller than expected: cobalt is a rare metal, <b>the</b> <b>pigment</b> is highly toxic, and the industry had already established effective ways for recycling cobalt materials. In some cases, industry was able to change to cobalt-free alternatives.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, German anatomist Johann Heinrich Meckel {{recorded}} black-brown pigment granules in {{the blood}} and spleen of a patient {{who had died in}} a mental hospital. Meckel was thought to have been looking at malaria parasites without realizing it; he did not mention malaria in his report. He hypothesized that <b>the</b> <b>pigment</b> was melanin. The causal relationship of pigment to the parasite was established in 1880, when French physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, working in the military hospital of Constantine, Algeria, observed pigmented parasites inside the red blood cells of malaria sufferers. He witnessed the events of exflagellation and became convinced that the moving flagella were parasitic microorganisms. He noted that quinine removed the parasites from the blood. Laveran called this microscopic organism Oscillaria malariae and proposed that malaria was caused by this protozoan. This discovery remained controversial until the development of the oil immersion lens in 1884 and of superior staining methods in 1890–1891.|$|E
