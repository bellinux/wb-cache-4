5|$|A second tournament, the Cromwell Cup {{was played}} a year later. This {{time it was}} only open to teams under two years old. Out of the four teams that competed <b>The</b> <b>Wednesday</b> emerged victorious. The final was a goalless draw after 90minutes so the teams played on until a goal was scored.

40|$|Background There is a {{commonly}} held assumption that early August is an unsafe period {{to be admitted}} to hospital in England, as newly qualified doctors start work in NHS hospitals on <b>the</b> first <b>Wednesday</b> of August. We investigate whether in-hospital mortality is higher in the week following <b>the</b> first <b>Wednesday</b> in August than in the previous week. Methodology A retrospective study in England using administrative hospital admissions data. Two retrospective cohorts of all emergency patients admitted on <b>the</b> last <b>Wednesday</b> in July and <b>the</b> first <b>Wednesday</b> in August for 2000 to 2008, each followed up for one week. Principal Findings The odds of death for patients admitted on <b>the</b> first <b>Wednesday</b> in August was 6 % higher (OR 1. 06, 95 % CI 1. 00 to 1. 15, p =  0. 05) after controlling for year, gender, age, socio-economic deprivation and co-morbidity. When subdivided into medical, surgical and neoplasm admissions, medical admissions admitted on <b>the</b> first <b>Wednesday</b> in August had an 8 % (OR 1. 08, 95 % CI 1. 01 to 1. 16, p =  0. 03) higher odds of death. In 2007 and 2008, when the system for junior doctors' job applications changed, patients admitted on Wednesday August 1 st had 8 % higher adjusted odds of death than those admitted <b>the</b> previous <b>Wednesday,</b> but this was not statistically significant (OR 1. 08, 95 % CI 0. 95 to 1. 23, p =  0. 24). Conclusions We found evidence that patients admitted on <b>the</b> first <b>Wednesday</b> in August have a higher early death rate in English hospitals compared with patients admitted on <b>the</b> previous <b>Wednesday.</b> This was higher for patients admitted with a medical primary diagnosis...|$|R

5|$|Tom Pryce {{began his}} final race weekend, the 1977 South African Grand Prix at Kyalami, by setting the fastest time in <b>the</b> <b>Wednesday</b> {{practice}} session, held in wet weather.

5|$|By now, Chapman {{had retired}} as a player in {{first-class}} football, having played his last match against Watford in January 1909, but filled the gap he left, as well as showing his eye for spotting talent, by signing players such as future England international Fanny Walden. As Southern League champions, Northampton contested and lost the 1909 FA Charity Shield, 2–0 to Newcastle United, and although they did not win the Southern League title again during Chapman's time as manager, they {{finished in the top}} four in each of the following three seasons. Additionally, they proved their mettle in the FA Cup against First Division sides, knocking out <b>The</b> <b>Wednesday</b> and taking Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United to replays, losing 1–0 both times.|$|E

5|$|Chapman {{was still}} working at the coke works in Selby when his ban was imposed, but by Christmas 1920 the company was sold up and he was laid off. Soon after, however, he was {{approached}} by Huddersfield Town to become assistant to Ambrose Langley, {{who had been a}} former team-mate of Herbert Chapman's brother Harry at <b>The</b> <b>Wednesday.</b> Huddersfield Town backed Chapman in an appeal against his ban, arguing that as he had been working at the factory in Barnbow during the war, he had not been in charge of Leeds City during the time illegal payments were paid. The ban was overturned, and Chapman was formally installed as Langley's assistant on 1 February 1921.|$|E
5|$|Geen {{was then}} {{selected}} and played three times for Wales in the 1912–1913 season. He earned his first cap against the same touring South Africans on 14 December. His next international appearance, under the captaincy of his Newport teammate Tommy Vile, was on 18 January 1913 against England. Wales were beaten in Cardiff 0–12. After the game, and {{disappointed by the}} performance {{of most of the}} team, the selectors made nine changes for the upcoming match against Scotland. Only two backs were to be retained, Bobby Williams, the fullback, and Billy Geen, deemed the outstanding threequarter against England, moving from wing to centre. However, on <b>the</b> <b>Wednesday</b> preceding the encounter in Edinburgh, Geen withdrew after a training session due to an ongoing shoulder injury, and his place on the team was taken by Willie Watts.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, {{the club}} {{submitted}} a successful application {{to join the}} Football League and were placed into the Second Division for the 1920–21 season. Stewart brought in several players with Football League experience, breaking the club's transfer record on two occasions to sign Jimmy Gill and later Jimmy Blair from <b>The</b> <b>Wednesday.</b> They played their first match in the Football League on 28 August 1920, defeating Stockport County 5–2, and finished the season in second place to win promotion to the First Division, finishing behind Birmingham City on goal average, and also reached the semi-final of the FA Cup. In their third season in the top-tier, the team finished runners-up to Huddersfield Town due to a goal average difference of 0.024, drawing their final match 0–0 as club record goalscorer Len Davies missed a penalty.|$|E

5|$|In 1964 he and Kenneth Adam {{initiated}} the new anthology series <b>The</b> <b>Wednesday</b> Play, a BBC equivalent of Armchair Theatre, which had great success and critical acclaim with plays {{written and directed}} by the likes of Dennis Potter, Jeremy Sandford and Ken Loach. The strand attracted comment and debate for several of its productions, such as Cathy Come Home, a Tony Garnett production of a Jeremy Sandford script, which dealt with the issue of homelessness. There were also problems caused by Newman bringing in freelance directors to work on the programme, who sometimes overspent on their plays to try and increase their impact; with staff directors this could be compensated by reducing the budget of a subsequent production, but for a freelancer there would be no such recourse.|$|E
5|$|In their {{passage to}} the final Manchester City faced {{opposition}} from the top division {{in all but one}} round. Second Division Woolwich Arsenal, City's opponents in the second round, were the exception. Sunderland were defeated 3–2 at Hyde Road in the first round, and the visit to Arsenal yielded a 2–0 win. A club record crowd of 30,022 watched the quarter-final against Middlesbrough, but a 0–0 draw meant a replay at Ayresome Park was required, which City won 3–1 to set up a semi-final against <b>The</b> <b>Wednesday.</b> Two goals from Turnbull and one from Meredith gave City a 3–0 win at Goodison Park.|$|E
5|$|Kneale had {{returned}} to writing for television with the BBC {{for the first time}} since Quatermass and the Pit when his play The Road was broadcast in September 1963. The play concerned the population of an 18th-century village who become haunted by visions of a future nuclear war, and was followed by several further one-off dramas for the BBC over the following decade, including two entries into BBC1's <b>The</b> <b>Wednesday</b> Play anthology strand. During this period he was regarded as one of the finest writers working for the BBC. Kneale did his first work for the ITV network during this time, writing one-off play The Crunch for the ATV company in 1964.|$|E

5|$|Manchester City did {{not return}} {{directly}} to Manchester, but instead went to Liverpool, as the club's final league fixture was scheduled for Monday afternoon at Everton. At this point Manchester City were still in contention for the league title. However, a 1–0 defeat at Goodison Park eliminated City from the title race and confirmed <b>The</b> <b>Wednesday</b> as champions. The team arrived in Manchester in that evening, and travelled to the Town Hall to commence a victory parade. From the Town Hall, the parade travelled to Ardwick Conservative Club, via Deansgate, Market Street and Ardwick Green.

Additional extra buses normally provided by Go South Coast run from Bristol to the festival. On the Monday, passengers are transferred back in just one day with additional buses provided to meet the increased requirement. National Express provide extra coaches direct to the festival site from major UK towns and much of this work is subcontracted to smaller coach operators to provide the capacity required.|$|E
