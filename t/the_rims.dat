5|$|Shooting {{took place}} over several days at Music Bank, the famous {{rehearsal}} studios in London. Actor Michael spent forty hours practising the drumming beforehand, but with vision inside the suit limited to a camera feed piped to a small screen inside the head, precision was almost impossible. Many takes ended with the wooden drum sticks broken against <b>the</b> <b>rims,</b> sending shards of wood flying off-camera. This, combined with the difficulty of choreographing the delicate movements of the gorilla head with Michael's acting, meant that 35takes were required to produce the final 90-second scene.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{types and}} styles of {{ceramics}} {{have been found}} during the excavations at Gedi including Chinese porcelain, Islamic glazed ware, and locally produced earthenwares. Several examples of the ceramics recovered at Gedi are represented in different quantities at other coastal sites. Red slipped pottery is rare at Gedi, compared to other inland sites, while bowls with rounded bottoms, flat rims, and incised ornamentation on top of <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> are more common at Gedi. White to cream colored bowls were also found in small quantities, along with an isolated pottery type that has a golden brown luster. A sherd with a trellis pattern is a possible import from the African interior.|$|E
5|$|Paul Baras of Brasier set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the race}} on his first lap. He {{held on to the}} lead until the third lap, when Szisz took over first position, {{defending}} it to the finish. Hot conditions melted the road tar, which the cars kicked up into the faces of the drivers, blinding them and making the racing treacherous. Punctures were common; tyre manufacturer Michelin introduced a detachable rim with a tyre already affixed, which could be quickly swapped onto a car after a puncture, saving a significant amount of time over manually replacing the tyre. This helped Nazzaro pass Clément on the second day, as the FIAT—unlike the Clément-Bayard—made use of <b>the</b> <b>rims.</b>|$|E

Several other craters lie across <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> of Olivier, most notably a crater cutting across <b>the</b> northern <b>rim</b> and several smaller craters in <b>the</b> eastern <b>rim.</b> <b>The</b> remainder of <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> is worn and eroded, so that the features have become rounded and somewhat irregular.|$|R

5|$|Round <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> of deserts, {{where more}} {{precipitation}} occurred and conditions were more suitable, some groups took to cultivating crops. This {{may have happened}} when drought caused the death of herd animals, forcing herdsmen to turn to cultivation. With few inputs, {{they were at the}} mercy of the weather and may have lived at bare subsistence level. The land they cultivated reduced the area available to nomadic herders, causing disputes over land. The semi-arid fringes of the desert have fragile soils which are at risk of erosion when exposed, as happened in the American Dust Bowl in the 1930s. The grasses that held the soil in place were ploughed under, and a series of dry years caused crop failures, while enormous dust storms blew the topsoil away. Half a million Americans were forced to leave their land in this catastrophe.|$|E
5|$|Wear facets {{are areas}} of a tooth that show {{evidence}} {{of contact with}} a tooth in the opposing jaw when the teeth are brought together (known as occlusion). Flynn and colleagues identified two wear facets at {{the front and back}} margins of the talonid basin; they argue that these wear facets suggest the presence of a protocone (another cusp on the outer side of the tooth) on the upper molars. In a 2005 paper on Asfaltomylos, a related primitive mammal from Argentina, Thomas Martin and Oliver Rauhut disputed the presence of these wear facets within the talonid basin in Ambondro and instead identified wear facets on the cusps and crests surrounding the basin. They proposed that wear in the australosphenidan talonid occurs mainly on <b>the</b> <b>rims,</b> not in the talonid basin itself, and that australosphenidans may not have had a functional protocone.|$|E
5|$|In Greek antiquity {{the ideas}} of {{celestial}} spheres and rings {{first appeared in the}} cosmology of Anaximander in the early 6th century BC. In his cosmology both the Sun and Moon are circular open vents in tubular rings of fire enclosed in tubes of condensed air; these rings constitute <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> of rotating chariot-like wheels pivoting on the Earth at their centre. The fixed stars are also open vents in such wheel rims, {{but there are so many}} such wheels for the stars that their contiguous rims all together form a continuous spherical shell encompassing the Earth. All these wheel rims had originally been formed out of an original sphere of fire wholly encompassing the Earth, which had disintegrated into many individual rings. Hence, in Anaximanders's cosmogony, in the beginning was the sphere, out of which celestial rings were formed, from some of which the stellar sphere was in turn composed. As viewed from the Earth, the ring of the Sun was highest, that of the Moon was lower, and the sphere of the stars was lowest.|$|E

50|$|This crater {{has been}} worn by {{subsequent}} impacts, but retains the general appearance {{of its original}} form.

5|$|Labrador {{colouration}} {{is controlled}} by multiple genes. It is possible for recessive genes to re-emerge in later generations. Also, there can sometimes be unexpected pigmentation effects to {{different parts of the}} body. Pigmentation effects appear in regard to yellow Labradors, and sometimes chocolate, and hence the majority of this section covers pigmentation within the yellow Labrador. The most common places where pigmentation is visible are the nose, lips, gums, feet, tail, and <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> of the eyes, which may be black, brown, light yellow-brown ("liver", caused by having two genes for chocolate), or several other colours. A Labrador can carry genes for a different colour, for example a black Labrador can carry recessive chocolate and yellow genes, and a yellow Labrador can carry recessive genes for the other two colours. DNA testing can reveal some aspects of these. Less common pigmentations (other than pink) are a fault, not a disqualification, and hence such dogs are still permitted to be shown.|$|E
5|$|Reflections on {{the race}} by the organisers and the media {{generally}} concluded that the Grand Prix had been a poor replacement for the Gordon Bennett races. In part, this had been because the race was too long, and the system of starting the race—with each car leaving at 90-second intervals—had meant {{that there had been}} very little interaction between the competitors, simply cars driving their own races to time. The ACF decided that too much pressure had been put on drivers and riding mechanics by forbidding others to work on the cars during the race. It was also felt that the outcome of the race had been too dependent on the use of Michelin's detachable rims. Clément had driven the only Clément-Bayard to not have <b>the</b> <b>rims,</b> and it was thought that this contributed to Nazzaro passing him on the second day as he stopped to change tyres. Despite this, the ACF decided to run the Grand Prix again the following year. The publicity generated by the race prompted the German governing body to organise a similar event that favoured their own industry. The forerunner to the German Grand Prix, the Kaiserpreis (Kaiser's Prize) was raced in 1907.|$|E
25|$|A {{ceramic coating}} for <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> is {{available}} which may reduce wear {{and can also}} improve both wet and dry braking. It may also slightly reduce heat transfer {{to the inside of}} <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> because it is a thermal insulator.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> outer <b>rim</b> of Curie {{has been}} damaged and {{reshaped}} by nearby impacts. The sides of <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> are relatively linear, giving the crater an overall box-like shape. The {{eastern part of}} <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> is partly overlaid by the notable satellite craters Curie C to the northeast and Curie G along the east. At the northern end <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> is overlaid by the small crater Curie Z. Several other small craters lie along <b>the</b> <b>rim,</b> especially to <b>the</b> southwest.|$|R
50|$|Much of <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> and {{interior}} of Ginzel have been flooded, {{leaving only a}} faint trace of <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> in <b>the</b> otherwise relatively level surface. <b>The</b> western <b>rim</b> projects more prominently above the surrounding irregular plain. The flooded satellite crater Ginzel L {{is attached to the}} southern part of <b>the</b> <b>rim,</b> and a small craterlet lies across <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> to <b>the</b> north.

In some parts along <b>the</b> <b>rim,</b> inward-facing scarps may be seen. <b>The</b> <b>rim</b> is not circular but appears to be petal-shaped.

25|$|Rim brakes are inexpensive, light, {{mechanically}} simple, easy to maintain, and powerful. However, {{they perform}} relatively poorly when <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> are wet, and will brake unevenly if <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> are even slightly warped. Because rims can carry {{debris from the}} ground to the brake pads, rim brakes {{are more prone to}} clogging with mud or snow than disc brakes (where braking surfaces are higher from the ground), particularly when riding on unpaved surfaces. The low price and ease of maintenance of rim brakes makes them popular in low- to mid-price commuter bikes, where the disadvantages are alleviated by the unchallenging conditions. The light weight of rim brakes also makes them desirable in road racing bicycles.|$|E
25|$|Rim brakes require regular maintenance. Brake pads {{wear down}} {{and have to be}} replaced. And before they wear out completely, their {{position}} may need to be adjusted as they wear. Because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal, the pads may lose their centering as they wear, causing the pads to wear unevenly. Over longer time and use, rims become worn. Rims should be checked for wear periodically as they can fail catastrophically if the braking surface becomes too worn. Wear is accelerated by wet and muddy conditions. Rim brakes require that <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> be straight (not out-of-round or warped). If a rim has a pronounced wobble, then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven, and the pads may rub <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> even when the brake is not applied.|$|E
