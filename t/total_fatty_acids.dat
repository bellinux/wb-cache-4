40|$|Microbially {{produced}} triacylglycerol (TAG) is {{a potential}} feedstock {{for the production of}} biodiesel, but its commercialization will require high yields from low-cost renewable feedstocks such as lignocellulose. The present study employs a multi-gene approach to increasing TAG biosynthesis in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. We demonstrate the redirection of carbon flux from glycogen biosynthesis towards <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> biosynthesis in a glycogen synthase deletion strain (Δgsy- 1). Furthermore, combining Δgsy- 1 with an enhanced TAG biosynthetic strain (acyl-Coenzyme A synthase; Δacs- 3) of N. crassa yielded a twofold increase in <b>total</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> accumulation over the control strain. The cellulose degrading potential of this double deletion strain was improved by deleting of the carbon catabolite regulation transcription factor (Δcre- 1) to create the triple deletion strain Δacs- 3 Δcre- 1; Δgsy- 1.

25|$|In chickens, {{a limited}} number of studies have {{investigated}} the specific effect of diet on the fatty acid composition of preen oil in meat chickens. The preen oil of meat chickens is dominated by saturated fatty acids, which make up to 97% of the <b>total</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> with 13 different medium to long chain saturated fatty acids (C8:0 to C22:0) detected. The preen oil contained several odd-chain fatty acids, which suggests they may be derived from lipolysis by the uropygial gland and/or its microbiome. Diet and gender had small but significant effects on levels of specific saturated fatty acid in the preen oil. The fatty acid composition of the preen oil did not reflect the more diverse fatty acid compositions of the diet or whole blood. Therefore, this clearly indicate that measuring the fatty acid profile of preen oil is not a suitable alternative approach for predicting the fatty acid composition of the blood of meat chickens.|$|E

[...] They have been referred to as [...] "poor man's sweetbread" [...] due to their texture and flavor. The fruit bodies can be eaten after slicing and frying in batter or egg and breadcrumbs, or used in soups as a substitute for dumplings. As early as 1861, Elias Fries recommended them dried and served with salt, pepper, and oil. The puffballs become inedible as they mature: the gleba becomes yellow-tinged then finally develops into a mass of powdery olive-green spores. L.perlatum is one of several edible species sold in markets in the Mexican states of Puebla and Tlaxcala. The fruit bodies are appealing to other animals as well: the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) includes the puffball in their diet of non-truffle fungi, while the [...] "puffball beetle" [...] Caenocara subglobosum uses the fruit body for shelter and breeding. Nutritional analysis indicates that the puffballs are a good source of protein, carbohydrates, fats, and several micronutrients.
