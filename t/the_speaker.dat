5|$|The {{most common}} failure modes were loss of {{sensitivity}} caused by dust infiltrating <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> panels, and internal arcing of the panels caused by excessive {{power to the}} step-up transformer; use at high altitudes may also cause the same effect. Also, because of its novel electrical characteristics, <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> could cause some amplifiers to become unstable and could result in damage to either or both.

5|$|Although it is {{designed}} to be used with the QUAD II, 303, or 405 power amplifiers with limiters, a power amplifier capable of delivering 15 watts per channel suffices – excessive voltage input is known to cause arcing within <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> panels. In fact, the instructions book states that any properly-regulated amplifier delivering no more than 33V is unlikely to cause damage to <b>the</b> <b>speaker.</b> Electrostatic speakers are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's case, at the rated nominal impedance of 16 ohms, the limit of 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's power output reaches 15 watts (if it were driving a conventional load).|$|E

40|$|Children {{with autism}} {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) {{are reported to}} have difficulty in learning novel word–object associations in case of discrepancy between objects in <b>the</b> <b>speaker's</b> focus and their focus (the discrepant condition). Two eye-tracking experiments investigated this difficulty by controlling and recording children's gaze fixation. In Experiment 1 's discrepant condition, typically developing (TD) children (age: 6 – 11 years) mapped the novel word to the novel object in <b>the</b> <b>speaker's</b> focus more frequently than children with ASD (age: 6 – 11 years). Additionally, the former looked at the object in <b>the</b> <b>speaker's</b> focus longer than the object in their own focus, while the latter looked at these objects for the same duration. In Experiment 2, the saliency of the object in <b>the</b> <b>speaker's</b> focus was enhanced and children with ASD (age: 6 – 12 years) mapped the word to the object in <b>the</b> <b>speaker's</b> focus as well as TD children (age: 6 – 12 years). Moreover, {{they looked at the}} object in <b>the</b> <b>speaker's</b> focus longer than the object in their focus. Comparison between experiments also confirmed improvement in performance, suggesting that the duration of gaze at an object in <b>the</b> <b>speaker's</b> focus is related to difficulty in referential word learning in children with ASD...|$|R

5|$|As can be {{seen from}} the diagram, the unusual shape of the Paragon made it very {{complicated}} to build. Engineering and factory translated the design into one executable on the shop floor. After overcoming the manufacturing challenges posed by the curved refractor panels and the cabinet legs, <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> entered production in late 1957.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the flat}} {{appearance}} of the loudspeaker, all three panels are slightly curved along the vertical axis to improve quality. The panels themselves are flat, but obtain their curvature by being slightly bent to a curved backing. With the bipolar nature of <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> emitting sound from both front and back surfaces as it does, {{the application of a}} felt sheet {{to the rear of the}} panels damps and absorbs high frequencies radiating from the back. A crossover network, set at 500Hz, remains necessary to adjust for back-to-front interference causing loss in output at low frequencies. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> should stand in free space to achieve optimum sound. The instructions book contains advice against placement of <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> in corners or positions close to or parallel with walls, and further explains that a corner placement will adversely affect bass response and be detrimental to the midrange because of standing waves generated.|$|E

60|$|The {{scene was}} a plain, bare, {{monotonous}} vault of a school-room, and <b>the</b> <b>speaker's</b> square forefinger emphasized his observations by underscoring every sentence {{with a line}} on the schoolmaster's sleeve.

The emphasis was helped by <b>the</b> <b>speaker's</b> mouth, which was wide, thin, and hard set. The emphasis was helped by <b>the</b> <b>speaker's</b> voice, which was inflexible, dry, and dictatorial. The emphasis was helped by <b>the</b> <b>speaker's</b> hair, which bristled on the skirts of his bald head, a plantation of firs to keep the wind from its shining surface, all covered with knobs, like the crust of a plum pie, as if the head had scarcely warehouse-room for the hard facts stored inside. <b>The</b> <b>speaker's</b> obstinate carriage, square coat, square legs, square shoulders, - nay, his very neckcloth, trained to take him by the throat with an unaccommodating grasp, like a stubborn fact, as it was, - all helped the emphasis.|$|R
