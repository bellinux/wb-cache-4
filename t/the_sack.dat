5|$|The {{person was}} first whipped, or beaten, with virgis sanguinis ("blood-colored rods", probably), {{and his head}} was clad/covered in a bag made of a wolf's hide. On his feet were placed clogs, or wooden shoes, and he was then put into the poena cullei, a sack made of ox-leather. Placed along with him into <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> was also an {{assortment}} of live animals, arguably the most famous combination being that of a serpent, a cock, a monkey and a dog. <b>The</b> <b>sack</b> was put on a cart, and the cart driven by black oxen to a running stream or to the sea. Then, <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> with its inhabitants was thrown into the water.|$|E

5|$|In 405 AD, the Ostrogoths invaded Italy itself, {{but were}} defeated. However, in 406 AD an {{unprecedented}} number of tribes {{took advantage of}} the freezing of the Rhine to cross en masse: Vandals, Suevi, Alans and Burgundians swept across the river and met little resistance in <b>the</b> <b>Sack</b> of Moguntiacum and <b>the</b> <b>Sack</b> of Treviri, completely overrunning Gaul. Despite this grave danger, or perhaps because of it, the Roman army continued to be wracked by usurpation, in one of which Stilicho, Rome's foremost defender of the period, was put to death.|$|E
5|$|In The Flopsy Bunnies, Benjamin Bunny and {{his cousin}} Flopsy are the parents of six young rabbits called simply The Flopsy Bunnies.

While McGregor is distracted, the six are freed by Thomasina Tittlemouse, a woodmouse, and <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> filled with rotten vegetables by Benjamin and Flopsy. At home, Mr. McGregor proudly presents <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> to his wife, but receives a sharp scolding when she discovers its actual content.|$|E

40|$|Boban Velickovic {{asked the}} {{following}} question: Is there a nontrivial forcing notion with <b>the</b> <b>Sacks</b> property {{which is also}} ccc? A ``definable'' variant of this question has been answered in [Sh: 480] (math. LO/ 9303208) : Every nontrivial Souslin forcing notion which has <b>the</b> <b>Sacks</b> property has an uncountable antichain. Here we show that it is consistent that every nontrivial forcing notion which has <b>the</b> <b>Sacks</b> property has an uncountable antichain. Independently, Velickovic has also proved the consistency of this statement...|$|R

5|$|The {{penalty of}} <b>the</b> <b>sack,</b> {{with the animals}} included, {{experienced}} a revival in parts of late medieval, and early modern Germany (particularly in Saxony). The 14th century commentator on the 13th century compilation of laws/customs Sachsenspiegel, Johann von Buch, for example, states that the poena cullei is the appropriate punishment for parricides. Some differences evolved within the German ritual, relative to the original Roman ritual, though. Apparently, the rooster was not included, and the serpent might be replaced with {{a painting of a}} serpent {{on a piece of paper}} and the monkey could be replaced with a cat. Furthermore, the cat and the dog were sometimes physically separated from the person, and <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> itself (with its two partitions) was made of linen, rather than of leather.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> of Constantinople in 1204 by Latin crusaders, two Byzantine {{successor}} {{states were}} established: the Empire of Nicaea, and the Despotate of Epirus. A third, the Empire of Trebizond, {{was created by}} Alexios I of Trebizond {{a few weeks before}} <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> of Constantinople. Of the three successor states, Epirus and Nicaea stood the best chance of reclaiming Constantinople. The Nicaean Empire struggled to survive the next few decades, however, and by the mid-13th century it had lost much of southern Anatolia. The weakening of the Sultanate of Rûm following the Mongol invasion in 1242–43 allowed many beyliks and ghazis to set up their own principalities in Anatolia, weakening the Byzantine hold on Asia Minor. In time, one of the Beys, Osman I, created an empire that would eventually conquer Constantinople. However, the Mongol invasion also gave Nicaea a temporary respite from Seljuk attacks, allowing it to concentrate on the Latin Empire to its north.|$|E

5|$|Following long-standing custom {{for a city}} {{taken by}} storm, the plundering of the city lasted for three days. Over seven {{thousand}} Thessalonians were taken captive to be sold in the slave markets of the Balkans and Anatolia, although many were subsequently ransomed by the Despot of Serbia, Đurađ Branković. The city's monuments suffered heavy damage in <b>the</b> <b>sack,</b> particularly the cathedral of Hagios Demetrios, as soldiers ransacked them for precious objects and hidden treasure. This damage was compounded later when the Sultan ordered that marble sections be stripped from them and taken to his capital, Adrianople, to pave a bath. On the fourth day, Sultan Murad entered the city himself and prayed at the Church of the Acheiropoietos, which became the city's first mosque. The Sultan then restored order and took measures to revive the city, evicting the soldiers from the homes they had occupied and returning them to their owners. According to Anagnostes, 7,000 inhabitants, including himself, were taken captive to be sold as slaves; only 2,000 {{of the population was}} left after <b>the</b> <b>sack,</b> many of which soon converted to Islam. The Sultan soon took measures to repopulate the city. He promised to return their properties to those inhabitants who had fled if they returned, and in some cases even ransomed captives from <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> himself. He also brought in Muslim and Christian settlers from other areas of Macedonia. A great number of empty houses were confiscated and given to the settlers, while most of the main churches were converted to mosques. The Turks settled mostly in {{the upper part of the}} city, from where they could better control it.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s {{the way in}} which some parts of Bath were redeveloped, {{resulting}} in the loss of some 18th- and 19th-century buildings, led to a popular campaign to change the way the city was developing, which drew strength from the publication of Adam Fergusson's <b>The</b> <b>Sack</b> of Bath. Since 2000, developments have included the Bath Spa, SouthGate, and the Bath Western Riverside project.|$|E

5|$|Mr. McGregor {{does not}} notice the substitution, and carries <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> home, {{continually}} counting the six rabbits.

They were tidily piled in lines side by side at the forward end of the waggon. They cautiously removed <b>the</b> <b>sacks</b> of <b>the</b> middle lines; Hector lay down feet foremost, and Paolo laid <b>the</b> <b>sacks</b> regularly over him till they reached the level of the others. Half a dozen were doubled and packed neatly in at the end, so as to conceal his head and prevent its being noticed that any had been taken out. The rest were distributed evenly, so that <b>the</b> <b>sacks</b> were all as level as before, and no one would have suspected that they had been disturbed.|$|R

5|$|The Hippodrome in Constantinople {{remained}} in use for races, games, and public ceremonies up to <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. In the 12th century, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–1180) even staged Western-style jousting matches in the Hippodrome. During <b>the</b> <b>sack</b> of 1204, the Crusaders looted the city and, among other things, removed the copper quadriga that stood above the carceres; {{it is now}} displayed at St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice. Thereafter, the Hippodrome was neglected, although still occasionally used for spectacles. A print of the Hippodrome from the fifteenth century shows a derelict site, a few walls still standing, and the spina, the central reservation, robbed of its splendor. Today, only the obelisks and the Serpent Column stand where for centuries the spectators gathered. In the West, the games had ended much sooner; {{by the end of}} the fourth century public entertainments in Italy had come to an end in all but a few towns. The last recorded chariot race in Rome itself took place in the Circus Maximus in 549 AD.|$|E
