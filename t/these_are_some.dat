5|$|Some TLPs may {{be caused}} by gas {{escaping}} from underground cavities. These gaseous events are purported to display a distinctive reddish hue, while others have appeared as white clouds or an indistinct haze. The majority of TLPs appear to be associated with floor-fractured craters, the edges of lunar maria, or in other locations linked by geologists with volcanic activity. However, <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> of the most common targets when viewing the Moon, and this correlation could be an observational bias.|$|E

25|$|Lubricants {{can also}} clog heat exchangers, {{especially}} the regenerator. For these reasons, designers prefer non-lubricated, low-coefficient of friction materials (such as rulon or graphite), with low normal {{forces on the}} moving parts, especially for sliding seals. Some designs avoid sliding surfaces altogether by using diaphragms for sealed pistons. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> {{of the factors that}} allow Stirling engines to have lower maintenance requirements and longer life than internal-combustion engines.|$|E
