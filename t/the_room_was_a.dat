5|$|South of {{the great}} hall was a two-storey {{building}} containing withdrawing chambers, dating from around 1200. Narrow windows opening onto the bailey were original but have since been filled in. The first floor was entirely occupied by the great chamber, furnished with a fireplace. In the south-west corner of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> door to a small room which was perhaps used as a safe. The ground floor {{was used as a}} cellar, through which the Carrickfergus Tower could be accessed. The polygonal tower was also accessible through the great chamber at first floor level. Fitted with latrines and a fireplace, it was an extension of the lordly accommodation provided by the great chamber.|$|E
25|$|The housemates were Cruz, Demet, Kara, and Harrison. The White Room and its {{fixtures}} and fittings were all entirely white, and the housemates had only white clothes to wear. White Room housemates were provided with a white porridge which fulfilled all nutritional needs. In the centre of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> red button. At any time, a housemate could press the red button if they wished to leave. This decision to leave was final and the quitting housemate could {{not return to the}} Big Brother House or the White Room. The challenge was that the housemate who stayed in the White Room the longest without pressing the red button would become a legitimate Big Brother housemate and enter the main house {{with the rest of the}} housemates.|$|E

Although more conventional artwork was created for the film, featuring the main characters' faces emblazoned over the Golden Gate Bridge, Wiseau chose the [...] "Evil Man" [...] for what he regarded as its provocative quality; {{around the time of}} the film's release, the image led many passers-by to believe that <b>The</b> <b>Room</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> horror film. Wiseau also paid for a small television and print campaign in and around Los Angeles, with taglines calling The Room [...] "a film with the passion of Tennessee Williams".|$|E

500|$|The Grandmother's Sitting Room is {{situated}} {{at the front of}} the eastern wing. It is noted for its deep blue hand-painted frescoes and formal furniture, and was the favourite room of Charles and Diana's grandmother, Cynthia Spencer, Countess Spencer. Nearby was the Muniment Room in which the Spencer family records were kept, described as a [...] "musty apartment" [...] which contained over 500 years of history, from medieval household accounts to letters from Jacobeans and accounts of Victorian house parties. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> favourite haunt of Spencer's grandfather, Albert Spencer, who would spend thousands of hours in it perusing over the family history. So guarded was he of the collection that when Winston Churchill once spent time in the room looking for information on his ancestor, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650–1722), Albert immediately doused out his cigar in fear of creating a fire. The records were sold to the British Library in the 1980s, leaving the room empty, before it was converted to what is known as the [...] "Steward's Room Flat". This part of the house once had an extensive collection of 1830s bull paintings by Richard Ansdell.|$|E

It is a piece of true Gothic architecture; no steel supports were used in the construction of its arches. Each arch is a true arch, and they support their own weight. Each base for the arches weighs five tons, and it is said that they are so firmly placed that each could hold a large truck. The large central piers act only as screens for the structural steel that holds up the upper floors of the building.|$|E
