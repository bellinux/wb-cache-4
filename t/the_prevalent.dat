40|$|We used a cultivation-independent, clone library-based 16 S rRNA gene {{sequence}} analysis to identify bacterial communities present during traditional fermentation in sour cassava starch, cachaça and cheese production in Brazil. Partial 16 S rRNA gene clone sequences from sour cassava starch samples collected on day {{five of the}} fermentation process indicated that Leuconostoc citreum was <b>the</b> most <b>prevalent</b> species, representing 47. 6 % of the clones. After 27 days of fermentation, clones (GenBank accession numbers GQ 999786 and GQ 999788) related to unculturable bacteria were <b>the</b> most <b>prevalent,</b> representing 43. 8 % of the clones from the bacterial community analyzed. The clone represented by the sequence GQ 999786 was <b>the</b> most <b>prevalent</b> at <b>the</b> end of the fermentation period. The majority of clones obtained from cachaça samples during the fermentation of sugar cane juice were from the genus Lactobacillus. Lactobacillus nagelli was <b>the</b> most <b>prevalent</b> at <b>the</b> beginning of the fermentation process, representing 76. 9 % of the clones analyzed. After 21 days, Lactobacillus harbinensis was <b>the</b> most <b>prevalent</b> species, representing 75 % of the total clones. At {{the end of the}} fermentation period, Lactobacillus buchneri was <b>the</b> most <b>prevalent</b> species, representing 57. 9 % of the total clones. In the Minas cheese samples, Lactococcus lactis was <b>the</b> most <b>prevalent</b> species after seven days of ripening. After 60 days of ripening, Streptococcus salivarius was <b>the</b> most <b>prevalent</b> species.

Mean age of patients suffering from hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism were 38. 24 ± 14. 45 and 25. 86 ± 14. 69 years old. Dry and Coarse/rough skin were <b>the</b> most <b>prevalent</b> manifestations in <b>the</b> skin involvement in hypothyroidism since softness was <b>the</b> most <b>prevalent</b> ones in hyperthyroidism.

5|$|Hieroglyphic writing {{dates from}} c. 3000BC, and is {{composed}} of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called hieratic, which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, Demotic, became <b>the</b> <b>prevalent</b> writing style, {{and it is this}} form of writing—along with formal hieroglyphs—that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the concentration of activity within the Dairi, the Greater Palace began {{to be regarded as}} increasingly unsafe, especially by night. One reason may be <b>the</b> <b>prevalent</b> superstition of the period: uninhabited buildings were avoided for fear of spirits and ghosts, and even the great Buraku-in compound was thought to be haunted. In addition, the level of actual security maintained at the palace went into decline, and by the early 11th century only one palace gate, the Yōmeimon in the east, appears to have been guarded. Hence burglary and even violent crime became a problem within the palace by the first half of 11th century.|$|E

5|$|The government's {{creation}} of the Imperial Academy of the Fine Arts in the 1820s {{played a pivotal role}} in influencing and expanding the visual arts in Brazil, mainly by educating generations of artists but also by serving as a stylistic guideline. The Academy's origins lay in the foundation of the Escola Real das Ciências, Artes e Ofícios (Royal School of the Sciences, Arts and Crafts) in 1816 by the Portuguese King JoãoVI. Its members—of whom the most famous was Jean-Baptiste Debret—were French émigrées who worked as painters, sculptors, musicians and engineers. The school's main goal was to encourage French aesthetics and the Neoclassical style to replace <b>the</b> <b>prevalent</b> baroque style. Plagued by a lack of funds since its inception, the school was later renamed as the Academy of Fine Arts in 1820, and in 1824 received its final name under the Empire: Imperial Academy of the Fine Arts.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>prevalent</b> {{force of}} Alchemy in Weyard's ancient past enabled the {{development}} of great civilizations.

The keys to unlocking Alchemy, the four Elemental Stars which hold the pure power of the four elements, are hidden within the mountain shrine, Mt. Aleph, which in turn is guarded by the town of Vale at the mountain's base. In the game's prologue, Saturos and Menardi, with help from a raiding party, storm Mt. Aleph with the intention to seize the Elemental Stars for themselves. They fail to solve the riddles guarding the stars and are driven away by the mountain's trap, a magically generated thunderstorm and rock slide.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>prevalent</b> {{opinion is}} that the church was {{constructed}} and painted in the early 14th century, which coincides with the lifetimes of the individuals most widely accepted as represented by the figures depicted in the church's frescoes.

However, alternative theories place the construction of the church in the mid-14th century, the mid-15th century or even the 16th century. The church and its frescoes were restored in 1958. The church was declared a Monument of Culture of Great Importance in 1982, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.|$|E

5|$|The {{properties}} of the rock underneath the Everglades {{can be explained by}} the geologic history of the state. The crust underneath Florida was at one point part of the African region of the supercontinent Gondwana. About 300 millionyears ago, North America merged with Africa, connecting Florida with North America. Volcanic activity centered on the eastern side of Florida covered <b>the</b> <b>prevalent</b> sedimentary rock with igneous rock. Continental rifting began to separate North America from Gondwana about 180 millionyears ago. When Florida was part of Africa, it was initially above water, but during the cooler Jurassic Period, the Florida Platform became a shallow marine environment in which sedimentary rocks were deposited. Through the Cretaceous Period, most of Florida remained a tropical sea floor of varying depths. The peninsula has been covered by seawater at least seven times since the bedrock formed.|$|E
