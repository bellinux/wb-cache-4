But on 22 June 1941 the first echelon only contained 171 divisions, numbering 2.6–2.9 million; and the second strategic echelon contained 57 divisions that were still mobilizing, most of which were still understrength. The second echelon was undetected by German intelligence until days after the invasion commenced, in most cases only when German ground forces bumped into them.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Italian defeats in Greece and North Africa, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht ordered <b>the</b> <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> some German forces to these theatres. Amongst the Luftwaffe contingent deployed was the command unit StG 3, which touched down in Sicily in December 1940. In the next few days, two groups - some 80 Stukas - were deployed under X.

5|$|Landing the {{aircraft}} required {{the extension of}} the retractable landing skid and <b>the</b> <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> a braking drogue parachute.

In other words, the state not only provides the funding but also identifies a credible external enemy who warrants such expenditure.|$|E

Albatrosses are easily attracted to these sightseeing boats by <b>the</b> <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> fish oil and burley into the sea. Visits to colonies can be very popular: the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in Dunedin, New Zealand, attracts 40,000 visitors a year, and more isolated colonies are regular attractions on cruises to subantarctic islands.|$|E

5|$|By {{the close}} of the first day, the 7th Army was still largely mobilising and concentrating, and fifth column actions meant that nearly all the {{fighting}} was conducted by border troops. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava, with the 128th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Ptuj, the 45th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Maribor and the 112th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion were at Slovenj Gradec and marching east towards Dravograd. German and Italian air attacks interfered with <b>the</b> <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> troops and command was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services.|$|E
5|$|In 1214 John {{began his}} final {{campaign}} to reclaim Normandy from Philip.

Nonetheless, when John left for Poitou in February 1214, many barons refused to provide military service; mercenary knights had to fill the gaps. John's plan was to split Philip's forces by pushing north-east from Poitou towards Paris, whilst Otto, Renaud and Ferdinand, supported by William Longespée, marched south-west from Flanders.|$|E
