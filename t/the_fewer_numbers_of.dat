Zinn argues this by stating, [...] "Student protests against the ROTC resulted in the canceling of those programs in over forty colleges and universities. In 1966, 191,749 college students enrolled in ROTC. By 1973, the number was 72,459." [...] The number of ROTC students in college drastically dropped and the program lost any momentum it once had before the anti-war movement.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> {{girls that}} {{take part in}} Mathematics and Science {{programmes}} than those of boys in Namibia prompted this study. Few Namibian students pass Grade 12 Mathematics and Science with symbols required by the University of Namibia and other higher educational institutions in Africa and abroad. When the numbers of male students and female students who graduate both at secondary school and university levels are compared, {{it becomes clear that}} very few female students graduate. The study investigated how socio-cultural factors influence girls’ participation in Mathematics and Science. Information used in this study was collected from 1442 girls from 14 schools in Hardap and Khomas regions. Literature has demonstrated the importance of self-concept, motivation and influence from parents and teachers as imperative factors for a change in girls’ perceptions of Mathematics and Science. The analysis showed that both beliefs and attitudes of girls are negatively influenced by some cultural and traditional norms. Additional barriers include lack of support from parents, teachers and peers as well as the masculine face that is given to Mathematics and Science. The investigation also revealed the need to motivate girls from an early age. This can be done by empowering and preparing them socially, physically and mentally in these fields. Motivating female students can also be achieved with the help and support from parents, teachers and the entire education sector. Further Teacher EducationM. Ed. (Natural Science Education...|$|E
40|$|A {{recent article}} by James Evans in Science (Evans 2008) is being widely {{discussed}} in the science and publishing communities. Evans 2 ̆ 7 in-depth research on citations in over 34 million articles and how online availability affects citing patterns, found that the more issues of a journal that are available online, <b>the</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> articles in that journal are cited. If the journal is available for free online, it is cited even less. Evans attributes this phenomenon to more searching and less browsing (which he feels eliminates marginally relevant articles {{that may have been}} found by browsing) and the ability to follow links to see what other authors are citing. He concludes that electronic journals have resulted in a narrowing of scientific citation patterns. This brief article expands on the evidence cited by Evans (Boyce et al. 2004; Tenopir et al. 2004) based on the authors 2 ̆ 7 ongoing surveys of academic readers of scholarly articles. Reading patterns and citation patterns differ, as faculty read many more articles than they ultimately cite and read for many purposes in addition to research and writing. The number of articles read has steadily increased over the last three decades, so the actual numbers of articles found by browsing has not decreased much, even though the percentage of readings found by searching has increased. Readings from library-provided electronic journals has increased substantially, while readings of older articles have recently increased somewhat. Ironically, reading patterns have broadened with electronic journals at the same time citing patterns have narrowed...|$|E
