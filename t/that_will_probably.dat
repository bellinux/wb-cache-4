25|$|Moreover, criticisms {{have been}} made {{on the way the}} {{operation}} was led. According to Michael Kometer and Stephen Wright, the outcome of the Libyan intervention was reached by default rather than by design. It appears that there was an important lack of consistent political guidance caused particularly by the vagueness of the UN mandate and the ambiguous consensus among the NATO-led coalition. This lack of clear political guidance was translated into an incoherent military planning on the operational level. Such a gap may impact the future NATO's operations <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> face trust issues.|$|E
25|$|The Law on Fisheries {{requires}} that {{total allowable catch}} (TAC) levels are set for fishery stocks. It defines these levels as the “scientifically justified annual catch of aquatic biological resources of particular species in a fishing area”. However, the Law on Fisheries {{then goes on to}} state that industrial fisheries are not necessarily required to base their catch on TAC. The Law does not explain this further, but calls {{for the federal government to}} issue a special TAC setting statute. Pacific salmon is the main stock <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> not have TAC, but will have regulated fishing effort instead.|$|E

500|$|The opening {{number for}} the episode, [...] "Hot for Teacher", was commended by most critics. Futterman {{described}} it as a [...] "high-energy performance with the right amount of absurdity". Brett Berk of Vanity Fair gave the musical number a four out of five stars, and cited the choreography as the highlight of the performance. West gave it a grade of [...] "A–", and wrote, [...] "This was such big fun and the backup guys ... really helped amp it up." [...] Slezak was less enthusiastic about the sequence. He was critical of Salling's vocals, and felt that a heavy metal song was not suited to his stylings; he ultimately gave it a [...] "C+" [...] grade. He also criticized the choreography, and stated that he had to [...] "downgrade a little for Blaine and Mike Chang's grotesque 'whoopsie, I'm hiding an erection!' dance move <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> haunt me to my grave." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{difficulties}} continued, {{partly because}} giving plants scientific names relies on [...] "type specimens". Ultimately, if botanists {{want to know}} whether a particular plant is an example of, say, Mammillaria mammillaris, {{they should be able to}} compare it with the type specimen to which this name is permanently attached. [...] Type specimens are normally prepared by compression and drying, after which they are stored in herbaria to act as definitive references. However, cacti are very difficult to preserve in this way; they have evolved to resist drying and their bodies do not easily compress. A further difficulty is that many cacti were given names by growers and horticulturalists rather than botanists; as a result, the provisions of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (which governs the names of cacti, as well as other plants) were often ignored. Curt Backeberg, in particular, is said to have named or renamed 1,200 species without one of his names ever being attached to a specimen, which, according to David Hunt, ensured he [...] "left a trail of nomenclatural chaos <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> vex cactus taxonomists for centuries." ...|$|E

AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine chose the song as a [...] "top pick" [...] from Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, while Amos Barshad of The New York Times listed it as the fifth top song of the summer. In contrast, [...] "Obsessed" [...] received a mixed review from the Los Angeles Times writer, Todd Martens, who wrote that although [...] "its feistier Mimi than 're used to", she ultimately [...] "has been molded to fit current trends" [...] and that the single [...] "again sells out the songbird to her producers."

2500|$|Reception {{towards the}} song was positive, with many critics praising the song's fun nature and Pitbull verses. Amaya Mendizabal of Billboard praised the track, calling it [...] "a massive dance record," [...] writing that the {{potential}} hit [...] "begs for a dance troop and some serious choreography." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator agreed, naming it a [...] "surefire dance smash for the summer." [...] Wass also praised Lopez and Pitbull collaboration, writing that it is [...] "next-level in comparison to previous outings with Mr. Worldwide." [...] Rory Cashin of The Irish Times also praised Pitbull verses, calling them [...] "fun" [...] (noting that they never thought they'd actually write those words) and praised Lopez [...] "on her most flirtatiously playful."

2500|$|Accepting that Lee did {{not write}} the {{pamphlet}} {{raises the question of}} who did. Wood asserts that the authorship of the pamphlets is a mystery <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> never be solved, though he believes it probable that they were produced by a New York resident. Robert Webking argues that Melancton Smith was probably the author. Webking finds deep similarities between Smith's speeches at the New York ratifying convention and the Federal Farmer. Furthermore, a computational analysis of Smith's writings and speeches done by John Burrows found that Lee's authorship [...] "found no support at all" [...] and Smith was the most likely author. Smith, a New York lawyer, was one of the Anti-Federalist leaders at the New York convention, though he eventually voted for the Constitution. Webking speculates that Smith might have kept his authorship of the Federal Farmer pamphlets a close secret so as not to jeopardize his future as a politician in heavily Federalist New York City.|$|E
2500|$|Hiti created Death-Day in {{collaboration}} with Joseph [...] "Joe" [...] Midthun, who took {{on the role of}} editor. Midthun lived in the same apartment building as Hiti and studied film in college, which got the two talking about comics. As Hiti [...] "respected what he had to say," [...] he showed Midthun an early draft of Death-Day, after which he slowly became part of the creation process. The development of Death-Day took multiple years: though Midthun considered the art to be of high quality, the two had difficulty figuring out an ending for the comic. Hiti and Midthun went through a process of moving art around and changing the format of the story, but to no avail. After a few years, this version of the story was scrapped and the two started from scratch. Hiti has said that he has [...] "4-foot high stack of pages" [...] <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> never be released.|$|E

2500|$|Lieutenant Frederick Woods, the torpedo officer, {{opened the}} test cocks on the tubes. Unfortunately, the test cock on tube number 5 {{was blocked by}} some enamel paint so no water flowed out even though the bow cap was open. Prickers to clear the test cocks had been {{provided}} {{but they were not}} used. This combined with a confusing layout of the bow cap indicators — they were arranged in a vertical line with 5 at the bottom (2,1,4,3,6, and then 5) and the [...] "Shut" [...] position for tube 5 on the dial was the mirror image of tube 6 above it — led to the inner door of the tube being opened.

2500|$|The {{characters}} of Fairy Tail have received both praise and criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network describes the characters' styles {{as having a}} [...] "strong 'bite me' vibe" [...] and compared the visual style to that of One Piece author Eiichiro Oda. In his review of the second volume, Kimlinger said that Cancer's fighting style [...] "is a kick". In reviewing the first DVD/Blu-ray volume of Fairy Tail, Carlo Santos of Anime News Network says [...] "with a lead character as pumped-up as Natsu, it's hard not {{to get caught up}} in his energy". Santos also praises Happy, citing his character as an [...] "entertaining diversion, proving that animal sidekicks can be fun to listen to and not just a necessary annoyance". In his reviews of the Blu-ray/DVDs, Neil Lumbard of DVD Talk mentions the [...] "strong likeability factor of each of the main characters". Anime News Network writer Rebecca Silverman, in her review of the 20th volume, said, [...] "Mashima still manages to get some action and laughs in as well, including one especially funny subplot involving Gajeel. Wendy takes over from Lucy as the primary female of the series for most of this volume, and how you feel about <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> depend upon which character you prefer." [...] Silverman also thought that readers [...] "may have had mixed feelings about Jellal's return earlier in this arc, but the bond between him and Erza has been underlying their scenes for most of their page time together [...]" [...] However, she said that [...] "for the romantics in the audience, Jellal is still a criminal, and the government wants him. And so they come for him," [...] and pointed out that [...] "Erza fans and detractors will find it deepens her character a little while still finding it sad." ...|$|E
2500|$|Suárez {{returned}} from his ban on 6 February against Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League, coming on as a substitute in a 0–0 draw at Anfield; Dalglish reacted to his return by saying [...] "It's fantastic to have him back. He {{should never have been}} out in the first place". Ahead of the 11 February game between United and Liverpool at Old Trafford, the Premier League stated that the formal pre-match handshake would go ahead, Ferguson stated that he thought Evra should shake Suárez's hand, while Dalglish stated that Suárez would too. However, during the traditional pre-game handshakes, Suárez appeared to avoid Evra's hand, leading to Evra grabbing Suárez's arm. Suárez ignored Evra and continued down the line causing Evra to throw his arms up in protest and Rio Ferdinand to also avoid shaking Suárez's hand. Despite Liverpool ordering Suárez not to talk about the racial abuse incident, Suárez continued to discuss it. In May 2012, Suárez called his suspension [...] "strange and unbelievable" [...] and said that there was [...] "not a single convincing proof that [...] had done any of the things they accused [...] of doing"; he also denied that he had refused to shake Evra's hand. In 2014, Suárez released his autobiography Crossing the Line, in which he continued to deny the verdict that he had racially abused Evra, stating [...] "what some people will never want to accept is that the argument took place in Spanish. I did not use the word [...] "negro" [...] the way it can be used in English", despite admitting that the word [...] "negro" [...] means [...] "black". He also complained about the after-effects, saying the verdict that he was a racist would be [...] "a stain on my character <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> be there forever".|$|E
