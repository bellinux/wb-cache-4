40|$|Circular steel <b>tube</b> <b>filled</b> with steel-reinforced {{high-strength}} concrete is a {{new model}} of composite column design. The fire resistance of this composite column was investigated experimentally. One circular steel <b>tube</b> column <b>filled</b> with steel-reinforced high-strength concrete and one circular steel <b>tube</b> column <b>filled</b> with high- strength concrete were tested under axial load and fire. The test results show that the axial deformations of both kinds of the composite columns under the same load level have experienced three stages variation:the initial expansion deformation stage,the compression deformation gradual growth stage and the damage stage with the dramatic increasing in compression deformation. The second compression stable development stage of the circular steel <b>tube</b> <b>filled</b> with steel-reinforced high-strength concrete is much longer than that of the circular steel <b>tube</b> column <b>filled</b> with high-strength concrete. Thus the fire endurance of the circular steel <b>tube</b> <b>filled</b> with steel-reinforced high-strength concrete reaches 166 minutes while the fire endurance of the circular steel <b>tube</b> column <b>filled</b> with high-strength concrete only reaches 46 minutes.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation of the performance of the Chemical Kinetics Shock tube at the Indian Institute of Science. The one-dimensional Lagrangian code L 1 d of Jacobs (1998) has been used to simulate the tube at several operating conditions. The conditions have different shock <b>tube</b> <b>filling</b> pressures, resulting in different shock speeds and different tube lengths, resulting in different dwell times. The simulations have been performed both with and without viscous effects simulated in the tubes. At the lowest shock <b>tube</b> <b>filling</b> pressure condition, the shock tube operates in an overtailored mode and it is undertailored at the higher filling pressure conditions. The results show that viscous effects, which lead to attenuation of the primary shock and heat loss from the test gas to the tube walls, result in an increasing p 5 pressure during the test time. The viscous effects are more dominant at the condition with the lowest filling pressure (highest primary shock speed). A simulation run for 50 ms after diaphragm rupture or the configuration with a long driver tube shows that the test gas is periodically re-compressed by reflections of waves along the driver and shock tubes. The recompressions become sequentially weaker and thus the test gas temperature and pressure are never raised to as high levels as for the primary compression...|$|E

It is a delayed complication following endometrial resection/ablation {{in women who}} have had tubal sterilisation procedures. Classically, lower abdominal pain and vaginal spotting occur typically 4 – 90  months after ablation [9]. The pain is usually cyclical in nature and may be either bilateral or unilateral. The pathophysiology is probably that of regeneration of endometrium in the cornual area. As the lower uterine segment is often scarred extensively, menstrual blood is forced out into the fallopian <b>tube,</b> <b>filling</b> the proximal tubal stump with blood. The resultant distension causes the described symptoms [10]. The incidence of this syndrome is reported in between 6 % and 10 % of cases [9] when both sterilisation and ablation were performed.|$|E

40|$|Large <b>tube</b> <b>filling</b> bubbles {{rising up}} through {{quiescent}} fluid in a vertical tube are {{commonly known as}} Taylor bubbles. Their apparent simplicity of form and behaviour has led to them being viewed and modelled as a paradigm for both large bubble dynamics, where there is no continuous gas flow, and slug flow for the case of continuous gas flow. Central to this approach is the question: what diameter tubes support stable Taylor bubbles? In this paper we examine the case of low viscosity Taylor bubbles through experiments and theory and show that they exist in much wider diameter tubes than had previously been reported. In order for the bubbles to be stable a settling period is required to allow the column to sufficiently quiesce. This settling period is compared favourably with the classical stability analysis of Batchelor (1987). We also observe such bubbles rising in an oscillatory manner if the gas input is abruptly curtailed. The oscillations match theoretical predictions well...|$|E

The process included placement of a bundle of the PMMA fibers in a <b>tube,</b> <b>filling</b> the interstices in the tube with a hot agarose solution, cooling to turn the solution into a gel, and then immersion in acetone to dissolve the PMMA fibers.

40|$|A previously-developed colissional, interhemispheric {{flux tube}} model for photoelectrons (PE) has been {{extended}} to three dimensions by including transport due to vector E x vector B and magnetic gradient-curvature drifts. Using this model, initial calculations of the high-energy (greater then 50 eV) PE distribution {{as a function of}} time, energy, pitch angle, and spatial location in the equatorial plane, are reported for conditions of low geomagnetic activity. To explore both the dynamic and steady behaviors of the model, the simulation starts with the abrupt onset of photoelectron excitation, and is followed to steady state conditions. The results illustrate several features of the interaction of photoelectrons with typical magnetospheric plasmas and fields, including collisional diffusion of photoelectrons in pitch angle with flux <b>tube</b> <b>filling,</b> diurnal intensity and pitch angle asymmetries introduced by directional sunlight, and energization of the photoelectron distribution in the evening sector.

40|$|Single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (SWNTs) {{produced by}} the arc-discharge method using non-magnetic catalysts were filled with Dy@C- 82 endohedral metallofullerenes. Transport measurements were performed on (DY@C- 82) @SWNT metallofullerene peapod samples in field-effect transistor configuration at 4. 2 K. After the transport investigations the substrates were partially etched away enabling us to take TEM images of the very same metallofullerene peapod samples on which transport had been carried out before. This procedure gives essential information on whether the sample measured was a single tube or a bundle and {{on the degree of}} <b>tube</b> <b>filling.</b> In the case of the presented measurements, TEM investigations revealed one sample to be a metallofullerene peapod bundle and another one to be an individual tube being not or not completely filled despite of a high overall sample filling. Both samples behave as semiconductors, where the latter sample exhibits Coulomb blockade oscillations for low bias voltages. Thus we present the first combined Coulomb blockade diamond and TEM measurements on a single nanotube and moreover the first transport data including the transfer characteristics I-sd(V-g) of a sample which is confirmed to be a metallofullerene peapod bundle.

40|$|Low depth {{geothermal}} energy can be efficiently {{used as a}} heat sink for building energy produced during sum-mer. In the current work, several geometries of geother-mal heat exchangers implemented in office building cli-matisation projects are evaluated for their energetic per-formance. For all geometries, simulation models were developed and validated using the experimental data, so that parameter studies could be carried out. A main result of the performance analysis is that the ground coupled heat exchangers have excellent coeffi-cients of performance ranging from 20 – 50 as average annual ratios of cold produced to electricity used. Best performance is reached, if the ground cooling system is used to cool down high temperature ambient air. The maximum heat dissipation per meter of ground heat ex-changer measured is often lower than assumed in the planning phase. In the projects evaluated, the heat dissi-pation varied between 8 W per meter for the low depth horizontal heat exchangers up to 25 W per meter for the vertical heat exchangers. The power dissipation varies by plus/minus 30 % depending on the soil conductivity. The heat conductivity of vertical <b>tube</b> <b>filling</b> material is very important, as the power dissipation changes by plus/minus 30 % for different materials. As {{a result of the}} work, planning and operation recom-mendations for the optimal choice of ground coupled heat exchangers for office building cooling can be given. 1...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{present the}} {{formulation}} of the indirect boundary element method (IBEM) for an axisymmetric Stokes flow with a free surface {{in the presence of}} gravity. The formulae of the fundamental solutions of the Stokes equations are found for velocities and tractions in the axisymmetric case. These expressions are written in the cylindrical coordinate system and contain the elliptic integrals of the first and second kind. For the integral equations discretization the constant elements are used. The necessary integrals are evaluated numerically except for the singular ones. The analytical formulae are obtained for them. Two boundary-value problems with mixed conditions are considered. The problem of the Poiseuille flow of a viscous fluid in a round tube with the exact solution was calculated to verify the IBEM algorithm and to demonstrate its approximation convergence. Another problem of the cylindrical <b>tube</b> <b>filling</b> by a viscous fluid with a free surface was calculated to prove the IBEM {{in the case of a}} moving boundary. The simulation in a steady-state formulation showed that the stationary advancing front shapes exist in both cases when the gravity acts against the flow (Stokes number St< 0) and aids the flow (0 <St≤ 0. 94). In the case of the Stokes parameter values greater than 1 the fountain flow was replaced by a jet flow.

Res., 86, 4795, 1981) were used. The technique enables cross-L plasma drifts and flux <b>tube</b> <b>filling</b> and emptying rates in the inner magnetosphere to be inferred continuously with a time resolution of 15 min. Ducted whistler mode signals, of typical strength ∿ 1 μVm^ from both transmitters were observed every night during February-March 1986,usually with multi-duct structure evident. Such structure was generally similar for the two transmitters, indicating propagation along {{a common set of}} ducts. This permitted the determination of the L-values of the ducts without reference to natural whistler data. Typical one hop group travel times were in the range 300 - 900 ms and Doppler shifts in the range - 500 mHz to + 500 mHz. Most ducts could be tracked for several hours, and during the night their associated group travel times often exhibited a steady decrease followed by a steady increase, suggesting a change from inward to outward cross-L drifting under the action of east-west electric fields of magnitude ∿ 0. 3 mVm^.
