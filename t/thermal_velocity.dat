Both electrons and ions will stream outward with their respective <b>thermal</b> <b>velocity.</b> If the ions are relatively cold, their <b>thermal</b> <b>velocity</b> will be small. The <b>thermal</b> <b>velocity</b> of the electrons will be fast due to their high temperature and low mass: [...] As the electrons leave the initial volume, they will leave behind a positive charge density of ions, which will result in an outwardly-directed electric field. This field will act on the electrons to slow them down and on the ions to speed them up. The net result is that both ions and electrons stream outward {{at the speed of}} sound, , which is much smaller than the electron <b>thermal</b> <b>velocity,</b> but usually much larger than the ion <b>thermal</b> <b>velocity.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>velocities</b> in N-body simulations of structure formation in warm dark matter models. Adopting the commonly used approach of adding <b>thermal</b> <b>velocities,</b> randomly selected from a Fermi-Dirac distribution, to the gravitationally-induced velocities of the simulation particles, we compare the matter and velocity power spectra measured from CDM and WDM simulations, {{in the latter case}} with and without <b>thermal</b> <b>velocities.</b> This prescription for adding <b>thermal</b> <b>velocities</b> introduces numerical noise into the initial conditions, which influences structure formation. At early times, the noise affects dramatically the power spectra measured from simulations with <b>thermal</b> <b>velocities,</b> with deviations of the order of ∼O(10) (in the matter power spectra) and of the order of ∼O(10 ^ 2) (in the velocity power spectra) compared to those extracted from simulations without <b>thermal</b> <b>velocities.</b> At late times, these effects are less pronounced with deviations of less than a few percent. Increasing the resolution of the N-body simulation shifts these discrepancies to higher wavenumbers. We also find that spurious haloes start to appear in simulations which include <b>thermal</b> <b>velocities</b> at a mass that is ∼ 3 times larger than in simulations without <b>thermal</b> <b>velocities.</b> Comment: 31 pages, 31 figures, LaTeX.

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{are used}} to study the flow of methane, ethane, and ethylene through carbon nanotubes at room temperature. The interatomic forces in the simulations are calculated using a classical, reactive, empirical bond-order hydrocarbon potential coupled to Lennard-Jones potentials. The simulations show that the intermolecular and molecule-nanotube interactions strongly affect both dynamic molecular flow and molecular diffusion. For example, molecules with initial hyperthermal <b>velocities</b> slowed to <b>thermal</b> <b>velocities</b> in nanotubes with diameters less than 36 Å. In addition, molecules moving at <b>thermal</b> <b>velocities</b> are predicted to diffuse from areas of high density to areas of low density through the nanotubes. Normal-mode molecular thermal diffusion is predicted for methane for nearly all the nanotube diameters considered. In contrast, ethane and ethylene are predicted to diffuse by normal mode, single-file mode, or {{at a rate that}} is transitional between normal-mode and single-file diffusion over the time scales considered in the simulations, depending on the diameter of the nanotube. When the nanotube diameters are between 16 and 22 Å, ethane and ethylene are predicted to follow a helical diffusion path that depends on the helical symmetry of the nanotube. The effects of atomic termination at the nanotube opening and pore-pore interactions within a nanotube bundle on the diffusion results are also considered. I...|$|R
40|$|The time-independent slowing-in {{distribution}} is evaluated for a fast beam of test particles released in an infinite Maxwellian plasma background for various situations including quantum-mechanical and classical scattering regimes. The analysis involves considerations of small angle deflection and large angle scattering events. The results are determined for plasma electrons with <b>thermal</b> <b>velocities</b> larger or {{smaller than the}} test particle and plasma ions with <b>thermal</b> <b>velocities</b> lower than the test particle. When plasma electrons and ions are slow the slowing-in distribution behaves as E/sub j//sup $sup 1 $/$sub 2 $/, where E/sub j/ is the test particle energy. When plasma electrons are faster than the test particles, the high-energy tail acquires a 1 /E/sub j/ shape. The origin of the test particle remains arbitrary and hence the results apply for particles produced by fusion events within the plasma proper and for particles externally injected. The total energy {{distribution is}} obtained and normalized, and ranges of validity are determined. The calculations are of the Boltzmann type, {{which is consistent with}} binary scattering models.
