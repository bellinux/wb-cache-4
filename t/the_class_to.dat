5|$|By World War I, most of {{the ships}} had been {{withdrawn}} to secondary roles, with Elba having {{been converted into a}} seaplane tender. Puglia was the only member of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>to</b> take an active role, based out of Durazzo. Etruria was deliberately blown up by the Regia Marina as a deception operation against Austria-Hungary. The remaining ships were broken up for scrap in the early 1920s, though the bow section of Puglia was preserved at the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E

5|$|The {{plans for}} Havfruen were {{purchased}} in 1910 {{and the boat}} was built at the Copenhagen Navy Yard. She was launched on 31 August 1912. She initially received the pennant number of H 1, but was assigned the number 2 in April 1913. She was later designated A 2 when the class {{became known as the}} A class late in her career. Havfruen was the last ship of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>to</b> be removed from service when she was stricken on 3 May 1932.|$|E
5|$|Thetis {{was ordered}} in May 1911 from Whitehead & Co. in Fiume. She was {{launched}} on 19 June 1912. She initially received the pennant number of T 1, but was assigned the number 4 in April 1913. Thetis was designated A 4 when the class {{became known as}} the A class later in her career. She and Havmanden were stricken on 26 April 1928, the first two boats of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>to</b> be removed from service.|$|E
5|$|U-20 {{was one of}} two boats of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>to</b> be {{built at}} the Pola Navy Yard.

5|$|Admiral Hipper was scuttled in Kiel in May 1945, leaving Prinz Eugen as {{the only}} member of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>to</b> survive the war. She was ceded to the US Navy, which {{ultimately}} expended the ship in the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in 1946. Seydlitz was towed to Königsberg and scuttled before the advancing Soviet Army could seize the ship. She was ultimately raised and broken up for scrap. Lützow, renamed Petropavlovsk, remained unfinished when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union. The ship provided artillery support against advancing German forces until she was sunk in September 1941. She was raised a year later and repaired enough to participate in the campaign to relieve the Siege of Leningrad in 1944. She served on in secondary roles until the 1950s, when she was broken up.|$|E
5|$|All five ships served {{extensively}} in Germany's colonial possessions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Seeadler {{participated in the}} suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Falke participated in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–03, and Condor and Cormoran helped to defeat the Sokehs Rebellion in the Caroline Islands in 1911. Bussard and Falke were scrapped in 1912, while Seeadler and Condor returned to Germany in 1914 to be decommissioned. Cormoran and Geier remained in the Pacific at the outbreak of World War I; the former's engines were worn out and she was scuttled in Tsingtao. Geier briefly attacked British shipping in the Pacific but put into Hawaii after running out of fuel. She was interned, seized by the US Navy in 1917, and commissioned as USS Schurz; she briefly served in the US Navy before she was accidentally rammed and sunk by a freighter in June 1918. Meanwhile, Seeadler was destroyed by an accidental explosion in 1917. Condor was the only member of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>to</b> survive the war; she was broken up for scrap in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Cormoran {{was based}} in Tsingtao with {{unusable}} engines; she was scuttled in the harbor since {{she was no longer}} operational. Geier briefly operated against British shipping in the Pacific before having to put into Hawaii for internment by the then-neutral United States. After the United States entered the war in April 1917, she was seized and commissioned into the US Navy as USS Schurz; she served as an escort until she was accidentally sunk following a collision with a freighter in June 1918. Seeadler and Condor, meanwhile, had been converted into mine storage hulks after the start of the war. Seeadler was destroyed by an accidental explosion in 1917. Condor was the only member of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>to</b> survive the war, and she was scrapped in 1921.|$|E

5|$|Cöln and Dresden, {{the only}} two ships to be completed, were {{launched}} on 5 October 1916 and 25 April 1917, respectively. Wiesbaden was launched on 3 March 1917 and was five months away from completion when she was canceled in December 1918. Magdeburg followed on 17 November 1917; she was nine months from being finished when she was canceled. Leipzig was launched on 28 January 1918 and canceled seven months from completion. Rostock followed on 6 April, and also was seven months away from being finished. Frauenlob, the last ship of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>to</b> be launched, on 16 September, was about thirteen months away from completion when she was canceled. The last three ships were canceled while still on the slipway.|$|E
5|$|Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand {{was built}} at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{dockyard}} in Trieste. She was laid down on 12 September 1907 and launched from the slipway on 8 September 1908. The teak used on her deck was the only material Austria-Hungary purchased abroad to build her. A {{month and a half}} after her launch, she was towed to the harbor in Muggia for completion. During a severe storm that night, she broke loose from her moorings; with no crewmen aboard, Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand drifted for several hours before running aground just off Izola. The following morning, the navy located her and started to refloat her. Completion was delayed by a welders' strike in 1908 and a riveters' strike in 1909. Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand was the first ship of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>to</b> be completed, and she was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 5 June 1910.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich der Grosse was {{the first}} ship of the fleet to be scuttled, sinking at 12:16. She was raised on 29 April 1937 and towed to Rosyth for scrapping. The ship's bell was {{returned}} to Germany in 1965, and is currently in the Fleet Headquarters in Glücksburg. König Albert followed at 12:54, the second ship of the fleet to sink. The ship was later raised on 31 July 1935 and broken up in Rosyth over the following year. Kaiser sank at 13:25, and was raised for scrapping on 20 March 1929; breaking work was conducted in Rosyth by 1930. Prinzregent Luitpold sank five minutes later, at 13:30. She too was raised, on 9 July 1931, and broken up in Rosyth. Kaiserin, the last ship of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>to</b> be sunk, slipped beneath the surface at 14:00. She was raised on 14 May 1936, and broken up that year in Rosyth.|$|E
