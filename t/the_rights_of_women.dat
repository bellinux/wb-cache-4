5|$|In rural areas, women {{traditionally}} work alongside {{their family}} to produce crops like tea and rice. In urban areas, women work in factories, living away from home. Most of these factory workers are young girls who send their income to their families.

5|$|The early women’s {{movement}} in China focused on eradicating {{the assumption that}} women were inferior to men. The early reformers believed that women needed help to improve their own attitudes about themselves, since even the women generally considered themselves to be inferior to men. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had shown an early interest in protecting <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> During the 2nd National Congress in 1922, the CCP issued a statement arguing {{for the end of}} Chinese traditions that repress women. The CCP also released a formal letter ensuring equality under the law for both men and women, and guaranteed equal pay for both genders during the 3rd National Congress.|$|E

The ACWF was responsible for publicizing the policy and its content, but questioned if the policy respected <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> In the end, the ACWF settled on requesting that its cadres comply with the law to set a good example for the country, to promote the One-Child policy to the Chinese women, and to strongly condemn any coercive action related to the policy.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> is an {{extension}} of Wollstonecraft's arguments in <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Men. In <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Men, as <b>the</b> title suggests, she is concerned with <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> particular men (18th-century British men) while in <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman,</b> she is concerned with <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> afforded to [...] "woman", an abstract category. She does not isolate her argument to 18th-century women or British women. The first chapter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> addresses <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> natural <b>rights</b> and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds. She answers that since natural rights are given by God, for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin. <b>The</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by political philosophers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|R

5000|$|The {{negative}} views towards Wollstonecraft persisted {{for over}} a century. <b>The</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> was not reprinted {{until the middle of}} the 19th century and it still retained an aura of ill-repute.

However, {{there is some evidence that}} <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>Woman</b> may be influencing current feminists.
