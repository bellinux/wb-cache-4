5000|$|Cornell's next {{role was}} to play Iris March in The Green Hat, a romance by Michael Arlen in 1925. <b>The</b> play had <b>themes</b> <b>of</b> <b>syphilis</b> and loose morals, and Iris March was a strong sexual creature. Leslie Howard {{played the role of}} Napier. While the play was still in Chicago, it became an {{international}} hit, known all over the US and Europe. Ashton Stevens, senior drama critic in Chicago, wrote that The Green Hat [...] "should die at every performance of its melodramatics, its rouge and rhinestones, its preposterous third act.... Already, I am beginning to forget its imperfections and remember only its charms." [...] Its chief charm, he conceded, was Cornell, who sent [...] "tiny bells up and down my unpurchasable vertebrae." [...] Most other critics panned the play itself, but nonetheless found it irresistible because of Cornell's ability to mesmerise, despite the garish dialogue. Critic George Jean Nathan wrote that the play was [...] "superbly acted in its leading role by that one young woman who stands head and shoulders above all the other young women of the American theater, Miss Katharine Cornell." ...|$|R
