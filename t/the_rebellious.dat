5|$|A trial, {{in which}} <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> actors sued the {{management}} at the King's Bench over the management's occupation of the building that the actors controlled the lease, was held on 12 November. The judgment under Chief Justice Philip Yorke was in favour of the actors, and {{they were to be}} granted control of the theatre building in March 1734. Highmore, in response, asked for a charge against John Harper, one of <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> actors, for being a vagrant, and Harper was sent to Bridewell Palace prison. This provoked a negative reaction by the public, and the action was attacked in the Daily Post of 16 November. Eventually, a writ of habeas corpus was issued on 20 November and he was released without a case tried against him. Having no other recourse, Highmore began to negotiate the sale of the theatre license. Charles Fleetwood purchased both Highmore and Wilks's portions of the license on 24 January 1734. On 2 February, the Daily Courant announced that Fleetwood asked for <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> actors to return. An agreement was reached for higher wages and promotion of Theophilus to a deputy manager of the theatre. The actors took control of the Theatre Royal on 8 March 1734, marking the end of the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{forces in}} Asia Minor {{seem to have}} been reorganised in 497 BC, with three of Darius's sons-in-law, Daurises, Hymaees, and Otanes, taking charge of three armies.

By 08:00, the rebellion was entirely dismantled, having succeeded in holding the palace grounds for much of the night but failing to find the recordings.|$|E

5|$|At {{the close}} of the Seven Years' War, Euro-American {{settlers}} began trickling into east Tennessee from the eastern colonies. In 1772, several pioneers negotiated a lease for Cherokee lands in northeast Tennessee and formed the Watauga Settlement. In spite of the agreement, tensions between the pioneers and the Cherokee rose steadily. By the outbreak of the American Revolution, the Cherokee were allied with the British against <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> American colonies, hoping to push the encroaching settlers out of their territory.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Caracalla, {{the son of}} Severus, {{marched on}} Parthia in 217 AD from Edessa to begin a war against them, but he was assassinated while on the march. In 224 AD, the Parthian Empire was crushed not by the Romans but by <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> Persian vassal king Ardashir I, who revolted, leading to the {{establishment}} of Sassanid Empire of Persia, which replaced Parthia as Rome's major rival in the East.|$|E
5|$|Frederick Barbarossa {{forced the}} Italian towns to {{surrender}} in September 1158. However, Milan and Crema again rose up in open {{rebellion against the}} emperor's rule after the Diet of Roncaglia ordered the restoration of imperial rights, including the emperor's rights to levy taxes in the Northern Italian towns. Géza sent his envoys to Barbarossa's camp and promised to dispatch further reinforcements against <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> towns.|$|E

He was <b>the</b> most <b>rebellious</b> Labour MP in the 1997–2001 Parliament, the 2001–2005 Parliament and the 2005–2010 Parliament, defying the whip 428 times while Labour was in power. The left-wing Jacobin magazine described him as [...] "a figure who for decades challenged them [...] from the backbench as one of <b>the</b> most <b>rebellious</b> left-wing members of parliament." ...|$|R
5|$|He {{started his}} {{military}} career soon {{after returning to}} the Commonwealth, raising a rota of 50 to 100 men. He gained military experience {{in the fight against}} <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> Cossacks during the Severyn Nalyvaiko's uprising under Field Crown Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski. During that conflict he participated in the battle of Kaniów on 14 April 1596, and in the siege of the Cossack tabor near Lubny. In 1599, he was appointed the Elder (starost) of Samogitia.|$|E
5|$|In August 1562, David Lindsay {{received}} Mary, Queen of Scots, at Edzell. The Queen {{was on a}} Royal progress, {{with the}} aim of subduing <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> Earl of Huntly, and spent two nights at Edzell. During her stay she convened a meeting of the Privy Council, attended by the nobility of Scotland. Her son, King James VI, visited Edzell twice; on 28 June 1580, and in August 1589.|$|E
5|$|In October 97 these {{tensions}} {{came to a}} {{head when}} the Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage. He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> Praetorians. Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius, Domitian's former chamberlain, were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was damaged beyond repair.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Evesham (4 August 1265) {{was one of}} the {{two main}} battles of 13th century England's Second Barons' War. It marked the defeat of Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, and <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> barons by the future King Edward I, who led the forces of his father, King Henry III. It took place on 4 August 1265, near the town of Evesham, Worcestershire.|$|E
5|$|The {{brutality}} and questionable {{legality of the}} earls' actions helped win political sympathy for the king. Pembroke was particularly offended, {{as he had been}} made to break his promise of safety to Gaveston, and his chivalric honour had been damaged. From this point on Pembroke sided firmly with King Edward in the political conflict. The king himself swore vengeance on his enemies, but found himself unable to move against them immediately, partly because they were in possession of a number of highly valuable royal jewels taken from Gaveston. A settlement was reached in October, whereby <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> barons and their retainers received a pardon. The king nevertheless emerged strengthened from the events, while Warwick and Lancaster were largely marginalised. This all changed in 1314, when the king decided to stage his first major campaign against the Scots. Warwick and Lancaster refused to participate and the campaign ended in a humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June. This led to another political reversal and Edward was forced to reconfirm the Ordinances, and submit to the leadership of <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> barons.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} {{coincided with}} the Dutch Revolt, 1568–1648, encouraging the participation of <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> Dutch provinces and the Spanish. The successful conclusion of the war consolidated Wittelsbach authority in northwestern German territories and encouraged a Catholic revival on the lower Rhine. Importantly, it also set a precedent for outside intervention in German religious and dynastic conflicts.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} of Ernst of Bavaria expanded the local feud {{into a more}} German-wide phenomenon. The pope committed 55,000crowns to pay soldiers to fight for Ernst, and another 40,000directly into the coffers of the new Archbishop. Under the command of his brother, Ernst's forces pushed their way into Westphalia, threatening Gebhard and Agnes at their stronghold at Arensburg. Gebhard and Agnes escaped to <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> provinces of the Netherlands with almost 1000cavalry, where Prince William gave them a haven in Delft. There, Gebhard solicited the impecunious William for troops and money. After William's assassination in July 1584, Gebhard wrote to Queen Elizabeth requesting assistance. Elizabeth responded {{toward the end of}} 1585, directing him to contact Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, her deputy with <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> Dutch, and recently commissioned as the commander-in-chief of her army in the Netherlands. Elizabeth had her own problems with adherents of her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, and the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|The era {{beginning}} with 1288 {{was characterized by}} longer periods in office. Roland Borsa survived 10 years, while his successor, Ladislaus Kán, lasted 20 years. This apparent stability was the consequence of the weakening of central government under the last two kings of the Árpád dynasty, Ladislaus IV (1272–1290) and Andrew III (1290–1301). Royal power was only restored in the reign of Charles I (1308–1342) who one by one defeated <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> noblemen throughout his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{pamphlet}} {{was read}} by Augustin Robespierre, brother of Maximilien Robespierre, who {{was impressed by}} the revolutionary context. The pamphlet itself had little effect against <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> forces, but served to advance Napoleon's career. He soon became recognised for his political ambitions by a Corsica-born politician, and family friend, Christophe Saliceti, who arranged to have it published and distributed. Christophe's influence, along with fellow Convention deputy Augustin Robespierre, advanced Napoleon into the position of senior gunner, at Toulon.|$|E

5|$|While {{on a tour}} of Europe in 1698, Peter {{learned that}} the Streltsy had rebelled, and {{immediately}} rushed home from Vienna. After defeating <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> regiments, Peter angrily ordered the torture of those who had incited the Streltsy to rebel. For almost a month and a half, men from Peter's Jolly Company, including Fyodor Romodanovsky, Boris Golitsyn, and Zotov, led the torture in secret.|$|E
5|$|After that war, {{he moved}} to a more prestigious hussar unit (rota), and likely due to a {{reduction}} of the royal army, {{he served in the}} private formation of Władysław Myszkowski and later, voivode Stanisław Lubomirski. In 1635 he might have served as a military adviser to John II Casimir Vasa, and possibly accompanied the king to Vienna. In 1637 he married Zofia Kobierzycka, and later that year he fought in the Pawluk Uprising against <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> Cossacks under Pavel Mikhnovych, participating in the battle of Kumejki. He led a cavalry charge at Kumejki which was instrumental for the Polish victory there. Earlier that year he served as a military delegate to the Sejm (parliament) in Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|After the {{presentation}} {{and discussion of}} the many proposals, a governmental commission was set up on 15 October 1910. It included Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro (painter), João Chagas (journalist), Abel Botelho (writer) and two military leaders of 1910: Ladislau Pereira and Afonso Palla. This commission ultimately chose the red-and-green of the Portuguese Republican Party, delivering an explanation based on patriotic reasons, which disguised the political significance behind the choice, as these had been the colours present on the banners of <b>the</b> <b>rebellious</b> during the republican insurrection of 31 January 1891, in Porto, and during the monarchy-overthrowing revolution, in Lisbon.|$|E
