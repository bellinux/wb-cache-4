500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1890 season, Dunlap engaged in {{protracted}} salary negotiations with President Nimick of the Alleghenies. In late March 1890, the Pittsburg Dispatch reported that the two sides had reached a resolution, [...] "and it now seems certain that Dunlap will play his old position in the Pittsburg league club." [...] Nimick said at the time: [...] "I had a long talk with Mr. Dunlap, and we agreed to terms for him to play with us this season. [...] Of course the terms were below those of last year, that is, he will play for much less than $5,000. [...] He did not sign a contract, for reasons that were quite satisfactory <b>to</b> <b>me</b> ... <b>We</b> know he is a good player and he is quite willing to remain with us." ...|$|E
500|$|Several United States Senators {{screened}} the film. New Mexico Democratic Senator Jeff Bingaman and Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid saw {{the movie}} at its Washington premiere at the National Geographic Society. New Mexico Democratic Senator Tom Udall planned to see the film saying [...] "It's such a powerful statement {{because of the way}} the movie is put together, I tell everybody, Democrat or Republican, they've got to go see this movie." [...] Former New Mexico Republican Senator Pete Domenici thought Gore's prominence on the global warming issue made it more difficult to get a consensus in Congress. Bingaman disputed this saying, [...] "It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> were having great difficulty recruiting Republican members of Congress to support a bill before Al Gore came up with this movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Waugh had {{welcomed the}} {{accession}} in 1958 of Pope John XXIII and wrote an appreciative tribute on the pope's death in 1963. However, he became increasingly {{concerned by the}} decisions emerging from the Second Vatican Council, which was convened by Pope John in October 1962 and continued under his successor, Paul VI until 1965. Waugh, a staunch opponent of Church reform, was particularly distressed by {{the replacement of the}} universal Latin Mass with the vernacular. In a Spectator article of 23 November 1962, he argued the case against change in a manner described by a later commentator as [...] "sharp-edged reasonableness". He wrote to Nancy Mitford that [...] "the buggering up of the Church is a deep sorrow <b>to</b> <b>me....</b> <b>We</b> write letters to the paper. A fat lot of good that does." ...|$|E

500|$|By October, the Foundation's {{financial}} affairs {{had reached}} a crisis point. According to his public relations assistant, Barbara Klowden, Hubbard became increasingly paranoid and authoritarian due to [...] "political and organizational problems with people grabbing for power." [...] He began an affair with the twenty-year-old Klowden, much to the annoyance of Northrup, who was clearly aware of the liaison. Klowden recalled that Northrup [...] "was very hostile <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>We</b> were talking about guns and {{she said to me}} that I was the type to use a Saturday night special" [...] (a very cheap [...] "junk gun"). One evening he arranged a double-date with his wife and Klowden, who was accompanied by Hollister, an instructor in the Los Angeles Dianetic Foundation. The dinner party backfired drastically; Northrup began an affair with Hollister, a handsome 22-year-old who was college-educated and a noted sportsman.|$|E
500|$|United manager Sir Alex Ferguson {{said his}} side {{deserved}} {{to win the}} game despite Chelsea performing better in the second half, and acknowledged the historical significance of the win, which came 40 years after the club's first European Cup title and 50 years after the Munich air disaster. He also said it was the first penalty shoot-out he had ever won as a manager: [...] "I won the Charity Shield that way, but that doesn't really count. The European Cup? The FA Cup? The Scottish cups? Never. I've lost three with Aberdeen and three with United, so seventh time lucky — magnificent." [...] Ferguson later apologised to Park Ji-sung for not including him in the matchday squad. Cristiano Ronaldo expressed his relief at his side's shoot-out victory, saying, [...] "In my opinion I played well in the game, scored a goal, and then missed the penalty. It would have been the worst day of my life. We deserved to win as we played better in the whole game. It means everything <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>we</b> have won both trophies, it is the best day in my life." [...] He then attempted to quash further speculation about his future and a potential transfer to Real Madrid, saying, [...] "I am going to stay." ...|$|E
500|$|Along with Anton Robinson, Marcus Browning and Stuart Beavon, Doe {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with Weymouth in May 2008. His only goal for Weymouth in the 2008–09 season was against Forest Green Rovers on 25 August, after scoring the equalizer to make the score 1–1 in the 71st minute, with a tap-in following a cross from Ryan Williams. In September, Doe was transfer listed, alongside James Coutts, Danny Knowles, Josh Webb and Michael Malcolm to generate money and bring new players to the club. He responded to being transfer listed by saying [...] "I do not {{see it as a}} big deal. It's not like the club has said <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> are putting you on the transfer list because we do not want you anymore", and suggested it could benefit both parties if a bigger club were willing to [...] "pay a bit of money". On 4 October, Doe was sent off in Weymouth's 3–2 home win over Eastbourne Borough, after he committed a foul on Andy Atkin in the penalty area, which resulted in a penalty kick that was later saved. Southern League Premier Division club Farnborough approached Doe on 30 December. He turned the offer down saying; [...] "moving to Farnborough would mean stepping down two levels which is not what I want to do". His last game for Weymouth was against Stevenage Borough on 14 February, in the 3–0 home defeat.|$|E

500|$|In July, Clark held {{another set}} of congressional {{hearings}} on the issue, attracting widespread media coverage. The hearings were tense with Clark, Kennedy, Javits, and testifying medical observers frequently clashing with Mississippi Senators John Stennis and James Eastland (both staunch segregationists), and Mississippi Board of Health officer A. L. Gray. Kennedy called child psychologist Robert Coles to testify on poverty's effect on children in the Mississippi Delta. One North Carolina doctor described [...] "an unwritten policy {{on the part of}} those who control the State to eliminate the Negro Mississippian either by driving him out of the State or starving him to death." [...] When Stennis and Eastland accused the doctor of committing libel against the welfare workers of their state, he invited them and other state officials to go see conditions for themselves, to which none accepted. On the second day of proceedings Secretary Freeman and Senator Javits got into a shouting match, with the senator arguing that the secretary should disregard local authorities' opinions, declare an emergency, and immediately supply food to the region. He remarked, [...] "We seem to be able to send airplanes to the Congo in a terrible hurry. We first heard of the desperation point of poor Mississippi Negroes 18 months agoand we are still hearing that there is starvation in Mississippi." [...] Kennedy openly expressed his frustration with Johnson administration officials' perceived inability to understand the extent of the Delta's problems and other bureaucratic complications, saying, [...] "It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> are floundering around a great deal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Only now are {{scholars}} {{beginning to}} chart its {{course in the}} science of the age, and we {{have every reason to}} expect that it will prove to be very important there as well. I would like to suggest, that patronage, together with other practices that the age itself reveals to us, may be the avenue most likely to lead us into a fruitful social history of the Scientific Revolution, a movement to which the present generation of scholars has devoted itself extensively. In our investigations, it appears <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>we</b> have allowed ourselves to be dominated excessively by concepts derived in the nineteenth century which are more applicable to that century and our own than to ... Efforts to impose them on the 17th century have appeared forced and largely barren, and I want to propose, not as a new dogmatism, but as a topic for discussion, the possibility that we need to come at the problem from a different angle, using seventeenth-century categories instead of nineteenth-century ones. Patronage was certainly a seventeenth-century category.|$|E
2500|$|The USA PATRIOT Act, H.R. 3162, was {{introduced}} into the House on October 23. It incorporated H.R. 2975 and S. 1510 {{and many of the}} provisions of H.R. 3004 (the Financial Anti-Terrorism Act). Though there were some objections and concerns raised about the legislation, a motion was made to suspend the rules, and the bill was passed. Patrick Leahy in particular commented that [...] "our ability to make rapid progress [...] was impeded because the negotiations with the Administration did not progress in a straight line. On several key issues that are of particular concern <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>we</b> had reached an agreement with the Administration on Sunday, September 30. Unfortunately, over the next two days, the Administration announced that it was reneging on the deal. I appreciate the complex task of considering the concerns and missions of multiple Federal agencies, and that sometimes agreements must be modified as their implications are scrutinized by affected agencies. When agreements made by the Administration must be withdrawn and negotiations on resolved issues reopened, those in the Administration who blame the Congress for delay with what the New York Times described as [...] "scurrilous remarks," [...] do not help the process move forward." [...] The Act was opposed by only one vote, the sole dissenting Senator being Russ Feingold who found a number of measures objectionable or troubling. Feingold's concerns included the way that the bill was passed, aspects of the wiretapping provisions, the changes to search and seizure laws, the expanded powers under FISA that allowed law enforcement to gain access to business records and the changes to detention and deportation laws for immigrants. The Act had a number of [...] "sunsets" [...] included in it after insistence by Republican Representative Richard Armey (R-TX) However, the Act took into account any ongoing foreign intelligence investigations and allowed them to continue once the sections had expired.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{songs were}} set to music by Francesco Berger and Lady Charlesmont, and later on by Margaret Ruthven Lang, Arthur Foote, Ethelbert Nevin, and many others. Marston wrote her, [...] "Much as we all love and admire your work, it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>we</b> {{have not yet fully}} {{realized}} the unostentatious loveliness of your lyrics, as fine for lyrics as your best sonnets are for sonnets. 'How Long' struck me more than ever. The first verse is eminently characteristic of you, exhibiting in a very marked degree what runs through nearly all of your poems, the most exquisite and subtle blending of strong emotion with the sense of external nature. It seems to me this perfect poem is possessed by the melancholy yet tender music of winds sighing at twilight, in some churchyard, through old trees that watch beside silent graves. Then nothing can be more subtly beautiful than the closing lines of the sonnet, 'In Time to Come':— [...] "'Which was it spoke to you, the wind or I? I think you, musing, scarcely will have heard.'" [...] Marston wrote her again concerning [...] "The House of Death" [...] {{that it was one of}} the most beautiful, the most powerful poems he knew. [...] "No poem gives me such an idea of the heartlessness of Nature. The poem is Death within and Summer without—light girdling darkness—and it leaves a picture and impression on the mind never to be effaced." [...] The poem of [...] "The House of Death" [...] is unequalled in its tragic beauty and sweetness. It was apropos of this volume that in one of his letters to her Robert Browning said he had closed the book with music in his ears and flowers before his eyes, and not without thoughts across his brain. And it was concerning a later poem, [...] "Laus Veneris," [...] inspired by a painting of his own, that Edward Burne-Jones said it made him work all the more confidently and was a real refreshment.|$|E
