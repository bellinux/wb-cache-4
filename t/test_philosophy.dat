40|$|That {{necessary}} condition hypotheses are deterministic forms {{part of the}} methodological and theoretical folk wisdom of the social sciences. When mentioned, it usually serves as means for a quick dismissal of the hypothesis in question, or as a segue to other issues. This essay proposes that the folk theorem “{{necessary condition}}s are deterministic” avoids the central issues which are causal mechanisms, functional form, and <b>testing</b> <b>philosophy.</b> These are the core topics since the two corollaries of necessary condition folk theorem are that (1) one counter-example suffices to reject a necessary condition hypothesis and (2) the world is probabilistic and hence deterministic theories are not useful. The first claim is about empirical <b>testing</b> <b>philosophy,</b> what one could call a naive falsificationist view. The second deals {{with the nature of}} the world, what Hall (2003) calls an ontological position about what kinds of theories will be most useful to (social) scientists. I shall argue that the folk theorem about necessary condition hypotheses and its two corollaries do not survive serious analysis...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} examine the {{development}} and <b>test</b> <b>philosophy</b> of a new, miniature pulsed plasma thruster destined for flight on the UW Dawgstar nanosatellite, and the development and <b>test</b> <b>philosophy</b> of small hydroxyl ammonium nitrate (HAN) thrusters intended for satellite use. The key to cost effective development is to know when both a rigorous analysis and a full test program is needed, and when the use of heritage hardware in a similar application may permit more latitude. The discussion will include a review of system challenges and considerations. Techniques used to design, build, and test new propulsion systems will be compared with techniques used to adapt mature hydrazine technology to new applications. As a specific example, long-term, full temperature range, materials compatibility testing for “green” monopropellants such as HAN is critical to developing suitable tanks, lines and components. In contrast, system level thermal analysis (without testing) will usually be adequate because HAN propulsion systems will be designed {{to take advantage of}} heritage hydrazine systems “lessons 2 ̆ 2...|$|E

Ascent flight control begins at liftoff and ends at linear aerospike main engine cutoff (NECO) while Transition and Entry flight control begins at MECO and concludes at the terminal area energy management (TAEM) interface. TAEM occurs at approximately Mach 3. 0. This task includes not only {{the design of the}} vehicle attitude control systems but also the development of requirements for attitude control system components and subsystems. The X- 33 attitude control system design is challenged by a short design cycle, the design environment (Mach 0 to about Mach 15), and the X- 33 incremental <b>test</b> <b>philosophy.</b> The X- 33 design-to-launch cycle of less than 3 years requires a concurrent design approach while the <b>test</b> <b>philosophy</b> requires design adaptation to vehicle variations that are a function of Mach number and mission profile. The flight attitude control system must deal with the mixing of aerosurfaces, reaction control thrusters, and linear aerospike engine control effectors and handle parasitic effects such as vehicle flexibility and propellant sloshing from the uniquely shaped propellant tanks. The attitude control system design is, as usual, closely linked to many other subsystems and must deal with constraints and requirements from these subsystems...|$|E
