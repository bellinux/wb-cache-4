5|$|He {{began in}} 1962 by writing a Fortran {{compiler}} for the PDP-4, before {{contributing to the}} development of the PDP-5 instruction set. Under Harlan Anderson (vice president of engineering), principal architect Gordon Bell led a team, including Kotok as an assistant logic designer, which developed the first commercial time-sharing computer, the PDP-6, designed and delivered in 1963–1964. Aiming at a scientific market, Digital machines had a 36-bit word length to accommodate artificial intelligence work in Lisp and to compete with IBM mainframe computers. In 1965, in what may have been the first around-the-world networking connection, a PDP-6 at the University of Western Australia in Perth was operated from Boston in the United States via a <b>telex</b> <b>link.</b>|$|E
5000|$|By 1984 {{the basic}} Mailbox service had been {{extended}} to give automatic access to the Telex service {{which at the time}} was still relatively common in business and was the standard way to reach remoter parts of the globe. Using a special <b>Telex</b> <b>Link</b> page, the message was composed in the usual way and then the destination country chosen and the Telex number entered before sending just like a standard message. <b>Telex</b> <b>Link</b> added the necessary Telex codes as required and tried to send the message as many times as required before positively confirming receipt by means of a special Mailbox message. Telexes could be sent to Prestel Mailbox users from a standard Telex terminal by using <b>Telex</b> <b>Link</b> number and inserting [...] "MBX" [...] and the relevant mailbox number as the first line of the telex message itself. The incoming telex message appeared to the Prestel recipient just as an ordinary Mailbox message but with the telex number inserted {{at the top of the}} frame.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 6,300 {{lines were}} in service when the Country got its first 1000-line Step-By-Step Exchange in 1936. In 1947, Consolidated {{purchased}} the Government operated system in Tobago {{and the first}} Teleprinter (<b>TELEX)</b> <b>link</b> was established in 1949.|$|E
50|$|Bangui {{is linked}} by {{satellite}} for telephone communication with France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Greece. The Republic has radiotelephone, telegraphic, and <b>telex</b> <b>links</b> with Paris. In 2003, {{there were an}} estimated two mainline telephones for every 1,000 people; about 1,200 people were {{on a waiting list}} fortelephone service installation. The same year, there were approximately 10 mobile phones in use for every 1,000 people.|$|R
50|$|Stofor {{became very}} popular in the City of London and was in use by banks, {{shipping}} brokers, commodity traders and insurance companies. Digital Equipment Corporation used one as the centre of its European message distribution network in Reading and others were in use {{by a number of}} household names in the food, chemical and engineering industries. Several were supplied to INMARSAT to provide <b>telex</b> <b>links</b> via satellite for ships at sea.|$|R
50|$|In January 1987, the Soviet-aided Intersputnik space {{communications}} station began {{operation in}} Phnom Penh and established two-way telecommunication {{links between the}} Cambodian capital and the cities of Moscow, Hanoi, Vientiane and Paris. The completion of the earth satellite station restored the telephone and <b>telex</b> <b>links</b> among Phnom Penh, Hanoi, and other countries {{for the first time}} since 1975. Although telecommunications services were initially limited to the government, these advances in communications helped break down the country's isolation, both internally and internationally.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the charges}} {{inherent}} in use of the Telex service, messages sent via Prestel <b>Telex</b> <b>Link</b> were chargeable, in 1984 {{at the rate of}} 50p for destinations in the UK, £1.00 for Europe, £2.00 for North America, £3.00 for elsewhere and even £5.00 for sending to ships via INMARSAT. There was no charge to Prestel users for receiving Telex messages.|$|E
50|$|Laser played most of {{its music}} from tape {{cartridges}} as the American management wanted control over material broadcast. The former research lab at {{the stern of the}} ship was converted into two studios plus a newsroom, which contained a Kaypro 4 computer and <b>telex</b> <b>link</b> with the station's office in New York. This link was achieved initially by a COMSAT installation on the upper deck, which used Inmarsat; it could access regular telephones, although at $15 a minute. Later the ship used a private marine VHF channel to a base in Kent.|$|E

50|$|Telex service spread within Europe and (particularly after 1945) {{around the}} world.By 1978, West Germany, {{including}} West Berlin, had 123,298 telex connections. Long before automatic telephony became available, most countries, even in central Africa and Asia, {{had at least}} a few high-frequency (shortwave) <b>telex</b> <b>links.</b> Often, government postal and telegraph services (PTTs) initiated these radio links. The most common radio standard, CCITT R.44 had error-corrected retransmitting time-division multiplexing of radio channels. Most impoverished PTTs operated their telex-on-radio (TOR) channels non-stop, to get the maximum value from them.|$|R
2500|$|From 1971, {{under the}} {{guidance}} of newly hired press secretary Allen Callaghan, a former Australian Broadcasting Corporation political journalist, Bjelke-Petersen developed a high level of sophistication in dealing with news media. He held daily media conferences where he joked that he [...] "fed the chooks", established direct <b>telex</b> <b>links</b> to newsrooms where he could feed professionally written media releases and became adept at distributing press releases on deadline so journalists had very little chance to research news items. The Premier's public profile rose rapidly with the resulting [...] media coverage. Bjelke-Petersen began regular media and parliamentary attacks on the Whitlam Labor government, vowing to have it defeated, and he and Whitlam exchanged frequent verbal barbs, culminating in the prime minister's 1975 description of the Queensland premier as [...] "a Bible-bashing bastard... a paranoic, a bigot and fanatical". The pair clashed over federal plans to halt the sale of Queensland coal to [...] Japan, take over the administration of Aboriginal affairs, remove outback petrol subsidies and move the Australian border in the Torres Strait southwards to a point midway between Queensland and Papua New Guinea. Bjelke-Petersen also vehemently opposed the Whitlam government's proposal for Medicare, a publicly funded universal health care system. The battles helped to consolidate Bjelke-Petersen's power as he used the media to emphasise a distinctive Queensland identity he alleged was under threat from the [...] "socialist" [...] federal government.|$|R
40|$|The {{outline of}} a design of a system using ultra small earth {{stations}} (picoterminals) for data traffic at 20 / 30 GHz is discussed. The picoterminals would be battery powered, have an RF transmitter power of 0. 5 W, use a 10 cm square patch antenna, and have a receiver G/T of about - 8 dB/K. Spread spectrum modulation would be required (due to interference consideration) to allow a <b>telex</b> type data <b>link</b> (less than 200 bit/s data rate) from the picoterminal to the hub station of the network and about 40 kbit/s on the outbound patch. An Olympus type transponder at 20 / 30 GHz could maintain several thousand simultaneous picoterminal circuits. The possibility of demonstrating a picoterminal network with voice traffic using Olympus is discussed together with fully mobile systems based on this concept...|$|R
