5|$|Eukaryotic cells {{exposed to}} DNA {{damaging}} agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, protein trafficking and degradation. Such genome wide <b>transcriptional</b> response is very complex and tightly regulated, thus allowing coordinated global response to damage. Exposure of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct <b>transcriptional</b> profiles. Similarities to environmental shock response {{indicates that a}} general global stress response pathway exist {{at the level of}} <b>transcriptional</b> activation. In contrast, different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response. The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the heterogeneity of mammalian cells. In an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{approaches}} {{aimed at improving}} cell survival {{in the presence of}} mutant huntingtin are correction of <b>transcriptional</b> regulation using histone deacetylase inhibitors, modulating aggregation of huntingtin, improving metabolism and mitochondrial function and restoring function of synapses.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the <b>transcriptional</b> {{regulation}} of EFS, but several <b>transcriptional</b> regulators for EFS have been proposed based on consensus binding sites in its promoter region for ATF (Activating transcription factor), NF-κβ, NF-κβ1, GATA-3, C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha), glucocorticoid receptors α and β, and p53. Expression of isoforms 1 and 2 has been detected in multiple tissues, with maximal expression in the placenta, and the embryonal central nervous system, heart, testes and lungs. Although its expression has been reported as lower in thymus and lymphocytes, functional studies of EFS to date have best defined it as important for immune system function. One screen for implantation-related genes regulated by progesterone found that EFS was downregulated by 17β-estradiol and progesterone in explants of late proliferative phase endometrium.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Sharma et al. {{presented}} a comprehensive analysis of transcription at single-nucleotide resolution by differential RNA-seq that confirmed the known acid induction of major virulence loci, {{such as the}} urease (ure) operon or the cag pathogenicity island (see below). More importantly, this study identified a total of 1,907 <b>transcriptional</b> start sites, 337 primary operons, and 126 additional suboperons, and 66 monocistrons. Until 2010, only about 55 <b>transcriptional</b> start sites (TSSs) were known in this species. Notably, 27% of the primary TSSs are also antisense TSSs, indicating that—similar to E. coli—antisense transcription occurs across the entire H. pylori genome. At least one antisense TSS is associated with about 46% of all open reading frames, including many housekeeping genes. Most (about 50%) of the 5' UTRs are 20–40 nucleotides (nt) in length and support the AAGGag motif located about 6 nt (median distance) upstream of start codons as the consensus Shine–Dalgarno sequence in H. pylori.|$|E
5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the RNA {{that carries}} {{information}} from DNA to the ribosome, {{the sites of}} protein synthesis (translation) in the cell. The coding sequence of the mRNA determines the amino acid sequence in the protein that is produced. However, many RNAs do not code for protein (about 97% of the <b>transcriptional</b> output is non-protein-coding in eukaryotes).|$|E
25|$|Eukaryotic <b>transcriptional</b> {{activators}} {{have separate}} DNA-binding and activating functions. Upon binding to its cis-element, an activator can recruit polymerase directly or recruit other factors {{needed by the}} <b>transcriptional</b> machinery. An activator can also recruit nucleosome modifiers that alter chromatin {{in the vicinity of}} the promoter and thereby help initiation. Multiple activators can work together, either by recruiting a common or two mutually dependent components of the <b>transcriptional</b> machinery, or by helping each other bind to their DNA sites. These interactions can synergize multiple signaling inputs and produce intricate <b>transcriptional</b> responses to address cellular needs.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that chromatin-based <b>transcriptional</b> regulation could be mediated by the effect of small RNAs. Small interfering RNAs can modulate <b>transcriptional</b> gene expression via epigenetic modulation of targeted promoters.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transcriptional</b> {{inhibition}} through microRNA-mediated chromatin reorganization {{followed by}} gene silencing.|$|E
25|$|In genetic engineering, {{tetracycline}} {{is used in}} <b>transcriptional</b> activation.|$|E
25|$|A 3’ leader sequence, 50 {{nucleotides}} in length, {{which acts}} as a <b>transcriptional</b> promoter.|$|E
25|$|Pre-mRNAs {{from the}} D. melanogaster gene dsx contain 6 exons. In males, exons 1,2,3,5,and 6 are joined {{to form the}} mRNA, which encodes a <b>transcriptional</b> {{regulatory}} protein required for male development. In females, exons 1,2,3, and 4 are joined, and a polyadenylation signal in exon 4 causes cleavage of the mRNA at that point. The resulting mRNA is a <b>transcriptional</b> regulatory protein required for female development.|$|E
25|$|Sex hormones may {{regulate}} {{the activity of}} AGAT. Treatment of male rats with testosterone propionate increases AGAT activity. In contrast, estrogen treatment decreases AGAT activity and induces weight loss. It is currently unclear whether {{the changes in the}} level of AGAT transcript results from altered mRNA stability or enhanced <b>transcriptional</b> rate. If estrogen-mediated alteration results from <b>transcriptional</b> regulation, the site of estrogen action is yet to be determined.|$|E
25|$|WGCNA {{has been}} widely used for {{analyzing}} gene expression data (i.e. <b>transcriptional</b> data), e.g. to find intramodular hub genes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transcriptional</b> gene {{regulation}} process depends on many {{spatial and temporal}} factors in the nucleus such as global or local chromatin states, nucleosome positioning, TF binding, enhancer/promoter activities. Variant that alter the function {{of any of these}} biological processes may alter the {{gene regulation}} and cause phenotypic abnormality. Genetic variants that located in distal regulatory region can affect the binding motif of TFs, chromatin regulators and other distal <b>transcriptional</b> factors, which disturb the interaction between enhancer/silencer and its target gene.|$|E
25|$|Transposon {{silencing}} {{is a form}} of <b>transcriptional</b> {{gene silencing}} targeting transposons. <b>Transcriptional</b> gene silencing is a product of histone modifications that prevent the transcription of a particular area of DNA. <b>Transcriptional</b> silencing of transposons is crucial to the maintenance of a genome. The “jumping” of transposons generates genomic instability and can cause extremely deleterious mutations. Transposable element insertions have been linked to many diseases including hemophilia, severe combined immunodeficiency, and predisposition to cancer. The silencing of transposons is therefore extremely critical in the germline in order to stop transposon mutations from developing and being passed on to the next generation. Additionally, these epigenetic defenses against transposons can be heritable. Studies in Drosophila, Arabidopsis thaliana, and mice all indicate that small interfering RNAs are responsible for transposon silencing. In animals, these siRNAS and piRNAs are most active in the gonads.|$|E
25|$|Sun {{and colleagues}} showed that proneural ngn1 {{inhibits}} gliogenesis by binding <b>transcriptional</b> co-activators like CBP/Smad1 or p300/Smad1 preventing the transcription of glialdifferentiation genes.|$|E
25|$|Nucleosomes are {{portions}} of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) that are wrapped around protein complexes called histone cores. These histone cores {{are composed of}} 8 subunits, two each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histones. This protein complex forms a cylindrical shape that dsDNA wraps around with approximately 147 base pairs. Nucleosomes are formed as a beginning step for DNA compaction that also contributes to structural support as well as serves functional roles. These functional roles are contributed by the tails of the histone subunits. The histone tails insert themselves in the minor grooves of the DNA and extend through the double helix, which leaves them open for modifications involved in <b>transcriptional</b> activation. Acetylation has been closely associated with increases in <b>transcriptional</b> activation while deacetylation has been linked with <b>transcriptional</b> deactivation. These reactions occur post-translation and are reversible.|$|E
25|$|The EDF1 gene encodes {{a protein}} {{that acts as}} a <b>transcriptional</b> {{coactivator}} by interconnecting the general transcription factor TATA element-binding protein (TBP) and gene-specific activators.|$|E
25|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}} gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is a <b>transcriptional</b> regulator for genes {{involved in}} fatty acid oxidation, gluconeogenesis, {{and is considered}} the master regulator for mitochondrial biogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Transcriptomics allows {{identification}} of genes and pathways that respond to and counteract biotic and abiotic environmental stresses. The non-targeted nature of transcriptomics allows the {{identification of}} novel <b>transcriptional</b> networks in complex systems. For example, comparative analysis {{of a range of}} chickpea lines at different developmental stages identified distinct <b>transcriptional</b> profiles associated with drought and salinity stresses, including identifying the role of transcript isoforms of AP2-EREBP. Investigation of gene expression during biofilm formation by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans revealed a co-regulated set of genes critical for biofilm establishment and maintenance.|$|E
25|$|The bromodomain is a motif that is {{responsible}} for acetylated lysine recognition on histones by nucleosome remodelling proteins. Posttranslational modifications of N- and C-terminal histone tails attracts various transcription initiation factors that contain bromodomains, including human <b>transcriptional</b> coactivator PCAF, TAF1, GCN5 and CREB-binding protein(CBP), to the promoter and have a significance in regulating gene expression. Structural analysis of transcription factors has shown that highly conserved bromodomains are essential for protein to bind to acetylated lysine.This suggests that specific histone site acetylation has a regulatory role in gene <b>transcriptional</b> activation.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} actin isoforms, {{both in the}} {{cytoplasm}} and the nucleus, may change for example in response to stimulation of cell growth or arrest of proliferation and <b>transcriptional</b> activity.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its ability}} to {{conformational}} changes and interaction with many proteins actin acts as a regulator of formation and activity of protein complexes such as <b>transcriptional</b> complex.|$|E
25|$|Polyadenylation tail: Creates a {{polyadenylation}} tail {{at the end}} of the transcribed pre-mRNA {{that protects}} the mRNA from exonucleases and ensures <b>transcriptional</b> and translational termination: stabilizes mRNA production.|$|E
25|$|Chromatin immunoprecipitation with {{sequencing}} (ChIP-seq) is {{a method}} used to identify protein binding sites on DNA and assess histone modifications. This tool has enabled examination of epigenetic regulation of browning and helps elucidate the mechanisms by which protein-DNA interactions stimulate the differentiation of beige adipocytes. Studies observing the chromatin landscapes of beige adipocytes have found that adipogenesis of these cells results from the formation of cell specific chromatin landscapes, which regulate the <b>transcriptional</b> program and, ultimately, control differentiation. Using ChIP-seq {{in conjunction with other}} tools, recent studies have identified over 30 <b>transcriptional</b> and epigenetic factors that influence beige adipocyte development.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} is {{a powerful}} <b>transcriptional</b> repressor, at least in CpG dense contexts. <b>Transcriptional</b> repression of protein-coding genes appears essentially limited to very specific classes of genes {{that need to be}} silent permanently and in almost all tissues. While DNA methylation does not have the flexibility required for the fine-tuning of gene regulation, its stability is perfect to ensure the permanent silencing of transposable elements. Transposon control is one the most ancient function of DNA methylation that is shared by animals, plants and multiple protists. It is even suggested that DNA methylation evolved precisely for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|Salicylic acid regulates c-Myc {{level at}} both <b>transcriptional</b> and post-transcription levels. Inhibition of c-Myc {{may be an}} {{important}} pathway by which aspirin exerts an anti-cancer effect, decreasing the occurrence of cancer in epithelial tissues.|$|E
25|$|EDCs are {{generally}} considered to be toxicants that either mimic or block the <b>transcriptional</b> activation normally caused by natural steroid hormones. These chemicals include those acting on androgen receptors, estrogen receptors and thryoid hormone receptors.|$|E
25|$|The {{regulation}} of gene expression in eukaryotes is achieved through {{the interaction of}} several levels of control that acts both locally to turn on or off individual genes {{in response to a}} specific cellular need and globally to maintain a chromatin-wide gene expression pattern that shapes cell identity. Because eukaryotic genome is wrapped around histones to form nucelosomes and higher-order chromatin structures, the substrates for <b>transcriptional</b> machinery are in general partially concealed. Without regulatory proteins, many genes are expressed at low level or not expressed at all. Transcription requires displacement of the positioned nucleosomes to enable the <b>transcriptional</b> machinery to gain access of the DNA.|$|E
25|$|Studies of {{chromatin}} structure also {{promise to}} shed light on <b>transcriptional</b> regulation in melanoma cells. It has long been assumed that nucleosomes are positioned randomly on DNA, but murine studies of genes involved in melanin production now suggest that nucleosomes are stereotypically positioned on DNA. When a gene is undergoing transcription, its transcription start site is almost always nucleosome-free. When the gene is silent, however, nucleosomes often block the <b>transcriptional</b> start site, suggesting that nucleosome position {{may play a role in}} gene regulation. In addition to genetic mutations, evidence demonstrates that epigenetic events (e.g. loss of DNA hydroxymethylation 5-hydroxymethylcytosine) also play roles in melanoma tumorigenesis.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} growth factors, amino acids, ATP, and oxygen levels {{regulate}} mTOR signaling. Several downstream pathways that regulate cell-cycle progression, translation, initiation, <b>transcriptional</b> stress responses, protein stability, and survival of cells are signaling through mTOR.|$|E
25|$|Mediator is a multiprotein {{complex that}} {{functions}} as a <b>transcriptional</b> coactivator. The Mediator complex {{is required for the}} successful transcription of nearly all class II gene promoters in yeast. It works in the same manner in mammals.|$|E
25|$|Transcription {{termination}} {{has also}} {{emerged as an}} important area of <b>transcriptional</b> regulation. Termination is coupled with the efficient recycling of polymerase. The factors associated with transcription termination can also mediate gene looping and thereby determine the efficiency of re-initiation.|$|E
25|$|The gene network (<b>transcriptional</b> {{and protein}} interactions) {{governing}} the early {{development of the}} fruit fly embryo {{is one of the}} best understood gene networks to date, especially the patterning along the anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) axes (See under morphogenesis).|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} {{may affect}} the transcription of genes in two ways. First, the methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of <b>transcriptional</b> proteins to the gene, and second, and likely more important, methylated DNA may be bound by proteins known as methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs). MBD proteins then recruit additional proteins to the locus, such as histone deacetylases and other chromatin remodeling proteins that can modify histones, thereby forming compact, inactive chromatin, termed heterochromatin. This link between DNA methylation and chromatin structure is very important. In particular, loss of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has been implicated in Rett syndrome; and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) mediates the <b>transcriptional</b> silencing of hypermethylated genes in cancer.|$|E
25|$|Termination is {{the process}} of {{breaking}} up the polymerase complex and ending the RNA strand. In eukaryotes using RNA Pol II, this termination is very variable (up to 2000 bases), relying on post <b>transcriptional</b> modification. See: Messenger RNA and Polyadenylation.|$|E
