500|$|According to the Opies, Perrault's great {{achievement}} was accepting fairy tales at [...] "their own level." [...] He neither recounted them with impatience nor mockery, and without {{feeling that they}} needed any aggrandisement such as a frame story—although he must have felt it useful to end with a rhyming moralité. Perrault would be revered today {{as the father of}} folklore if he had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> record where he obtained his tales, when, and under what circumstances.|$|E
500|$|The explicitness of the album's lyrics {{mandated}} a Parental Advisory logo in the United States, {{largely due}} to the lurid nature of the songs as well as their usage of profanity. Derogatory terms such as [...] "bitch", [...] "slut", and [...] "whore" [...] are used prominently in the songs. [...] "I try to place [...] next to fucked up imagery, because that's how I view things", said Love in a 1991 interview with Everett True. [...] "I sometimes feel that no one's <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> write about certain things in rock, that there's a certain female point of view that's never been given space." [...] In spite of its graphic lyrics, the underlying female themes in many of the songs led some journalists to tag the band as being part of the riot grrl movement, which Love was not directly associated with.|$|E
500|$|Love's lyrical {{content is}} {{composed}} from a female's point of view, and her lyrics {{have been described}} as [...] "literate and mordant" [...] and noted by scholars for [...] "articulating a third-wave feminist consciousness". According to a 2014 interview, lyrics have remained the most important component of songwriting for Love: [...] "I want it to look just as good on the page as it would if it was in a poetry book". A great deal of her songwriting has been diaristic in nature. Common themes present in Love's songs during her early career included body image, rape, suicide, conformity, elitism, pregnancy, prostitution, and death. In a 1991 interview with Everett True, Love said: [...] "I try to place [...] next to fucked up imagery, because that's how I view things... I sometimes feel that no one's <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> write about certain things in rock, that there's a certain female point of view that's never been given space".|$|E

The sub-prefect of Cossonay noted that the raid had been conducted by a large number of people, and that they had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> sort through the archives, taking all deeds and administrative papers of value but leaving all family records in place.|$|E

In his journal Colnett wrote that the time Barkley saved in not acquiring the licenses allowed him to arrive at Nootka Sound first. As a result, [...] "he engrossed the whole trade & ruined ours".

2500|$|An 25 October 2009, poll {{suggested}} that Ignatieff {{had a lower}} popularity than Dion at his worst showing as Liberal leader. A month later Dion's wife Janine Krieber wrote a scathing letter on her Facebook page in which she {{suggested that}} the Liberal Party was in full collapse and the future appeared bleak. She questioned Ignatieff's ability to lead the party out of its current woes, alleging that party members were duped by Ignatieff and would have recognized his obvious shortcomings if they'd only <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> read his academic writings. Krieber claimed that Dion was working to rebuild the party after the disappointing 2008 election, but their efforts were stymied by Ignatieff, who turned down the coalition with the other opposition parties, and who [...] "dethroned Dion without a leadership race". Dion {{was said to have}} no involvement in the criticism letter and later asked Kreiber to remove the Facebook post, which talks of deep divisions in the Liberal Party.|$|E
2500|$|At {{about the}} same time as Wood, Herbert Storing, who was working on his {{collection}} The Complete Anti-Federalist, came to the same conclusion that the case for Lee's authorship was weak, the only original evidence being the Courant article. Storing, however, argues that the case against Lee's authorship is also weak. Work produced since Wood's paper has been mixed in its attribution of the pamphlets, with some writers not naming an author and others citing the work as Lee's. Authors who have <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> comment on the debate generally concur with Wood, and no scholar has attempted a substantial refutation of Wood's paper. Walter Bennett, editor of a 1979 edition of the Federal Farmer, disagrees with Wood on many points but concludes that the evidence for Lee is not [...] "sufficient to justify continuing this attribution." [...] The editors of The Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution declare Wood's challenge to Lee's authorship to be [...] "effective." ...|$|E
