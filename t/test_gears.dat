Variations of four-square type <b>gear</b> <b>test</b> machines {{have been in}} use for durability and dynamics testing of both parallel- and cross-axis gear set. The basic layout of these machines is illustrated. The test rig is formed by two gear pairs, of the same reduction ratio, a <b>test</b> <b>gear</b> pair and a reaction gear pair, connected to each other through shafts of certain torsional flexibility to form an efficient, closed-loop system. A desired level of constant torque is input to the circuit through mechanical (a split coupling with a torque arm) or hydraulic (a hydraulic actuator) means. The system is then driven at any desired speed by a small DC motor. The main task in hand is {{the isolation of the}} <b>test</b> <b>gear</b> pair from the reaction gear pair under dynamic conditions.
