25|$|<b>Ties</b> <b>That</b> <b>Bind</b> did {{not sell}} {{as well as}} expected, and sold {{significantly}} less than the original game. In November, 2005 Midway announced it would miss its quarterly expectations, specifically citing poor sales of <b>Ties</b> <b>That</b> <b>Bind</b> and L.A. Rush. Midway expected to hit its $30 million revenue target, but expected loses to reach $29 million instead of the previously anticipated $19 million, blaming increased product development costs. For the fiscal year, their revenue expectations dropped from $200 million to $145 million, with expected losses of $95 million. The company ultimately reported a $29.1 million quarterly loss on revenues of $29.5 million.|$|E

25|$|Two major {{gameplay}} {{alterations in}} <b>Ties</b> <b>That</b> <b>Bind</b> concern pickups. Firstly, Torque {{can no longer}} stockpile Xombium bottles, allowing the player to refill their health whenever they wish. Instead, Torque must rely on stationary Xombium located at set points throughout the game. Secondly, the player is limited to carrying only two weapons at any given time, although is free to choose which two; the play may carry two melee weapons, two guns, or one of each. Also, whereas in the first game, Torque could only dual-wield the handgun, in <b>Ties</b> <b>That</b> <b>Bind,</b> he can dual-wield any one handed weapon, including the sawed-off shotgun. Guns {{can also be used}} to inflict minor melee damage.|$|E

25|$|Unique to Anglicanism is the Book of Common Prayer, the {{collection}} of services that worshippers in most Anglican churches used for centuries.

25|$|The game {{continues}} {{the story of}} Torque, a man sentenced to death for murdering his ex-wife and two children. In the original game, after arriving on death row in Abbot State Penitentiary on Carnate Island, {{off the coast of}} Maryland, an earthquake rocks the island, and the prison is attacked by strange supernatural creatures. During the mayhem, Torque escapes. <b>Ties</b> <b>That</b> <b>Bind</b> continues his story, as he flees the island and heads back to his home town of Baltimore, where he must face his past misdeeds, and confront his nemesis, a mysterious criminal kingpin known as Blackmore. Players who have a saved game from The Suffering can choose one of three different openings, based upon the ending they received in the first game.

25|$|<b>Ties</b> <b>That</b> <b>Bind</b> {{received}} favorable reviews, but {{was generally}} criticized {{as being too}} similar to the original game. Some critics felt the game would only appeal to fans of the first game, while others argued the more complex storyline and serious moral issues made it worthwhile on its own merits. The game was a commercial failure, and although Surreal Software initially spoke {{about the possibility of}} a multi-game series, no further Suffering games were made.|$|E

25|$|<b>Ties</b> <b>That</b> <b>Bind</b> {{was first}} {{referred}} to in late 2004, when Midway Games released an earnings statement in which it spoke of the financial success of the first game. No other information was revealed at the time, {{other than the fact}} that a sequel was in development. On January 19, 2005, Midway revealed the game would be released for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and was being developed by Surreal Software, the same team who had worked on the first game. They also announced the title, and revealed the game would begin moments after the end of the first game, but the intro sequence would depend on which ending the player received in the first game, assuming they still had a saved game file.|$|E
25|$|A {{major part}} of the {{gameplay}} in <b>Ties</b> <b>That</b> <b>Bind,</b> as in the original game, concerns Torque's morality. At numerous points during the game, the player will encounter situations where they have several choices as to how to proceed. These situations often involve NPCs, and the choices are usually to help the person (good morality), kill them (bad morality), or ignore them (neutral morality). In many situations, when Torque first encounters an NPC, the player will hear the voice of Torque's dead wife urging him to help them, and almost immediately afterwards will hear the voice of Blackmore, the game's antagonist, urging him to kill them. Over the course of the game, the decisions made concerning Torque's morality cumulate, and the player will get one of three endings based on Torque's final morality level. How Torque's actions affect his morality is usually indicated by the reaction of his wife, who will praise him if he commits a good act, and Blackmore, who will praise him if he does something evil. The player can get a rough idea of Torque's morality level by both his own physical appearance (he will begin to look less and less human the more evil acts he commits) and by looking at a family photograph which he carries with him at all times; the cleaner the photo, the purer his morality. If the photo is dirty, crumpled and covered in blood, his morality is moving towards evil. There is also a morality gauge in the menu, which shows exactly where Torque's morality is currently positioned.|$|E

30|$|Notice {{that there}} is a stark {{difference}} in the importance level of these top two edges. Indeed, the highest-ranking edge, (9, 13), appears in 65.6 % of all paths, whereas the second highest-ranking edge, (16, 17), appears in only 50 % of all paths. Hence, edge (9, 13) is a <b>tie</b> <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> and carries a significantly higher importance to the overall path structure than the second-highest-ranking edge, (16, 17)–a true bridge whose absence would disconnect the network.|$|R
40|$|The <b>tie</b> <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> all Americans, {{regardless}} of their demographic background, is faith in the American system of government.

In The Rhetoric of American Civil Religion: Symbols, Sinners, and Saints, contributors seek to examine some of those core elements of American faith by exploring the proverbial saints, sinners and dominant symbols of the American system.
