40|$|AbstractBackground:Of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved 5 -hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5 -HT 3) -receptor antagonists, {{dolasetron}}, ondan-setron, granisetron, and palonosetron, only dolasetron and palonosetron have {{a precaution}} in their FDA labeling concerning corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation. At FDA approved doses, QTc prolongation {{has been observed}} in clinical trials with some 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists (however, palonosetron has been only recently approved, with few published clinical data available). However, due to patient exclusion criteria, such trials with 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists may have failed to examine the risk of these agents in “real world” patients with cancer. Objective:The aim of this analysis {{was to assess the}} potential risk for selected cardiac adverse events associated with dolasetron, ondansetron, and granisetron use. Methods:The FDA combined Spontaneous Reporting System/Adverse Event Reporting System database was analyzed. The process of analyzing such a database for early warnings of potential hazards is known as signal generation. The statistical technique proportional reporting ratio (PRR) was used to aid detection of a <b>potential</b> <b>signal</b> within the database. PRR is the observed proportion of a given adverse event for the drug of interest (the number of events of interest for the drug divided {{by the total number of}} reports for the drug) divided by the expected proportion. Through the third quarter of 2002, the database was searched using the preferred term electrocardiogram qt corrected interval prolonged. Results:One, 3, and 0 cases were reported for dolasetron, ondansetron, andgranisetron, respectively. The number of cases did not satisfy 1 of the 3 criteria we utilized to define a <b>potential</b> <b>signal,</b> the 3 criteria being: 3 or more reported cases of the adverse event, a PRR value of at least 2, and a χ 2 value of > 4. As this term may be unlikely to be reported, the database was also searched using the term ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. The PRR, used as a parameter to detect a <b>potential</b> <b>signal</b> within the database, was 3. 23, 1. 31, and 1. 13 for dolasetron, ondansetron, and granisetron, respectively. The number of observed ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrests was ∼ 3 -fold higher with dolasetron compared with the expected value (calculated by dividing the individual agent's total number of events reported by the proportion of adverse events for all agents combined). The results for dolasetron fulfilled the criteria we used to define a <b>potential</b> <b>signal.</b> Conclusions:This analysis detected a <b>potential</b> <b>signal</b> for ventricular arrhythmiasand cardiac arrest with dolasetron, but not with ondansetron or granisetron. However, there are limitations of a PRR analysis, which include only measuring cases that have been reported, providing relative frequencies instead of actual rates, and not providing information on the severity of adverse events or causal relationships. In addition, our analysis does not include consideration of concomitant medications, and only 2 search terms were used. Errors in identifying <b>potential</b> <b>signals</b> may also include confounding factors, such as the underlying disease, potential confusion with reporting under trade and generic names, and potential multiple reporting of the same case...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Analysis of the {{pathogen}} interactome {{is a powerful}} approach for dissecting <b>potential</b> <b>signal</b> transduction and virulence pathways. It also offers opportunities for exploring new drug targets. Results In this study, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv was constructed using a homogenous protein mapping method, which has shown molecular chaperones, ribosomal proteins and ABC transporters to be highly interconnected proteins. A further analysis of this network unraveled the function of hypothetical proteins {{as well as a}} <b>potential</b> <b>signaling</b> pathway. A hypothetical protein, Rv 2752 c, which was linked to a metal cation-transporting ATPase, was characterized as a metal-beta-lactamase, through domain analysis in combination with an in vitro activity experiment. A second hypothetical protein, Rv 1354 c, and an unknown protein kinase, PknK, interacted with a similar group of inner membrane-associated ABC transporters in the PPI network. The interactions of Rv 1354 with these proteins were also confirmed by a further bacterial two-hybrid analysis. According to protein domain structures, the unique M. tuberculosis Rv 1354 c gene was proposed, for the first time, to be responsible for the turnover of cyclic-di-GMP, a second messenger molecule in this bacterium. A further structure-based inhibitors screening for Rv 1354 c was also performed in silicon. Conclusion We constructed a comprehensive protein-protein interaction network for M. tuberculosis consisting of 738 proteins and 5639 interaction pairs. Our analysis unraveled the function of hypothetical proteins as well as a <b>potential</b> <b>signaling</b> pathway. The group of ABC transporters, PknK, and Rv 1354 c were proposed to constitute a <b>potential</b> membrane-associated <b>signaling</b> pathway that cooperatively responds to environmental stresses in M. tuberculosis. The study therefore provides valuable clues in exploring new signaling proteins, virulence pathways, and drug targets. </p...|$|R
