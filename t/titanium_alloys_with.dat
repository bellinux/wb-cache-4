To date, improved strength and ductility for titanium alloys can be achieved in amorphous structure and nano/ultrafine/fine-grained size regime obtained by several kinds of materials forming methods. In this chapter, a material forming method by coupling spark plasma sintering with crystallization of amorphous phase, fabricating <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> <b>with</b> excellent mechanical properties, was reviewed systematically. By appropriate annealing of sintered amorphous alloy in bulk form prepared from spark plasma sintering at the supercooled liquid region of a mechanically alloyed amorphous alloy powder, crystallized phase with controllable grain size, phase morphology and distribution can be precipitated from the amorphous phase (or sintered amorphous alloy), and therefore, <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> <b>with</b> matrix of amorphous phase or crystallized phase as well as improved strength and ductility were obtained.

40|$|The {{improvement}} and {{mechanism of the}} fatigue resistance of TC 21 high-strength <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>with</b> a {{high velocity oxygen fuel}} (HVOF) sprayed WC- 17 Co coating was investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the corresponding stress measurement instrument, a surface roughness tester, a micro-hardness tester, and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to determine the properties of the HVOF WC- 17 Co coating with or without shot peening. The fatigue behavior of the TC 21 <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>with</b> or without the WC- 17 Co coating was determined by using a rotating bending fatigue testing machine. The results revealed that the polished HVOF sprayed WC- 17 Co coating had almost the same fatigue resistance as the TC 21 <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> substrate. This resulted from the polishing-induced residual surface compressive stress and a decrease in the stress concentration {{on the surface of the}} coating. Moderate-intensity shot peening of the polished WC- 17 Co coatings resulted in significant improvement of the fatigue resistance of the alloy. Furthermore, the fatigue life was substantially higher than that of the substrate, owing to the deep distribution of residual stress and high compressive stress induced by shot peening.

By introducing a second phase in a β-Ti matrix, series of optimized Ti-Nb-Fe-Co-Al and Ti-Nb-Cu-Ni-Al composites, {{which have a}} microstructure composed of ultrafine-grained and equiaxed CoTi 2 or (Cu,Ni) Ti 2 precipitated phases surrounded by a ductile β-Ti matrix, were fabricated by sintering and crystallizing mechanically alloyed amorphous powder. The as-fabricated composites exhibit ultra-high ultimate compressive strength of 2585 MPa and extremely large compressive plastic strain of around 40 %, which are greater than the corresponding ones for most titanium alloys. In contrast, the alloy fabricated by sintering and crystallizing Ti-Zr-Cu-Ni-Al amorphous powder, which possesses significantly higher glass forming ability {{in comparison with the}} Ti-Nb-Fe-Co-Al and Ti-Nb-Cu-Ni-Al alloy systems, exhibits a complex microstructure with several intermetallic compounds and a typical brittle fracture feature.
