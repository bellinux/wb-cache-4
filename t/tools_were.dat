5|$|During the 1980s {{very few}} {{specialized}} digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers {{from within the}} operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> created during the early 1990s to address the problem.|$|E
5|$|Production of the No. 20 resumed around 1947, {{at which}} time the company began to license the Oliver name to several European {{manufacturing}} companies. The standard desktop machine was eventually discontinued in favor of portable models; the company began to sell a German design, the Siemag Standard, as the Oliver standard. In 1958, Oliver purchased the Byron Typewriter Company, previously the Barlock Typewriter Company, of Nottingham. The licensing ventures were ultimately unsuccessful, and the company's machine <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> transferred to a factory in Germany. Production of all Oliver typewriters ended in May 1959.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{used his}} skills as an {{emergency}} medical technician (EMT) and previous experiences as a volunteer coordinator at the CALM Medical Clinic {{in order to build}} and administrate the clinic. The clinic recruited volunteer doctors, Physician Assistants, medical students, nurses, pharmacists, EMTs, and paramedics from different parts of the United States to volunteer for a week at a time. Medications and medical <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> donated by dozens of organizations including Pfizer, which donated the majority of the medications used. During its three months of operation, the clinic had over 5,500 documented patient encounters.|$|E

50|$|An {{improvement}} on CAT <b>Tooling</b> <b>is</b> BT <b>Tooling,</b> which looks similar and {{can easily be}} confused with CAT tooling. Like CAT Tooling, BT Tooling comes {{in a range of}} sizes and uses the same NMTB body taper. However, BT <b>tooling</b> <b>is</b> symmetrical about the spindle axis, which CAT <b>tooling</b> <b>is</b> not. This gives BT tooling greater stability and balance at high speeds. One other subtle difference between these two toolholders is the thread used to hold the pull stud. CAT <b>Tooling</b> <b>is</b> all Imperial thread and BT <b>Tooling</b> <b>is</b> all Metric thread. Note that this affects the pull stud only, it does not affect the tool that they can hold, both types of <b>tooling</b> <b>are</b> sold to accept both Imperial and metric sized tools.|$|R

5|$|There {{has been}} {{evidence}} of human habitation around Ashford since the Iron Age, with a barrow {{on what is}} now Barrow Hill dating back to 1500 BC. Two axes from the Lower Paleolithic period have been found near Ashford. During {{the construction of the}} Park Farm estate in the late 1990s, excavation in the area revealed tools from the Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic period dating back to the 7th century BC. A number of other Mesolithic <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> discovered during construction of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link through Ashford.|$|E
5|$|A {{category}} of ticket packages {{was created to}} be sold by an auction process at prices estimated at up to $1,000. All proceeds were donated to Music for Relief, a non-profit organization founded by Linkin Park to support disaster relief and programs to protect and restore the environment. Additionally, one dollar per concert ticket sold was contributed to the charity. A tent of Music for Relief was staffed by local volunteers at each concert. The tent featured a photo booth which enabled fans to document their concert experience and express their support to take action on climate change, {{leading up to the}} United Nations Climate Summit that took place on September 23, 2014 in New York City. Various clean energy <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> also showcased.|$|E

5|$|A concave line of {{abrasion}} {{and polishing}} {{can be found}} on both one of the central kerb-stones on the western end of the monument and a kerb-stone on the south-east of the monument. These have been attributed to the sharpening of flint and other stone axe-blades on these sarsens. It is possible that these <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> sharpened for use in cutting and carving the timber levers and struts which would have been used in erecting the stones and constructing the tomb. Similar evidence for the sharpening of tools has been found at West Kennet Long Barrow, as well as later prehistoric monuments such as Stonehenge.|$|E
5|$|From {{its release}} in 1998, Half-Life saw fervent support from {{independent}} game developers, due {{in no small}} part to support and encouragement from Valve Software. Worldcraft, the level-design tool used during the game's development, was included with the game software. Printed materials accompanying the game indicated Worldcraft's eventual release as a retail product, but these plans never materialized. Valve also released a software development kit, enabling developers to modify the game and create mods. Both <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> significantly updated with the release of the version 1.1.0.0 patch. Many supporting tools (including texture editors, model editors, and rival level editors like the multiple engine editor QuArK) were either created or updated to work with Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|From the Glades peoples, {{two major}} nations {{emerged in the}} area: the Calusa and the Tequesta. The Calusa was {{the largest and most}} {{powerful}} nation in South Florida. It controlled fifty villages located on Florida's west coast, around Lake Okeechobee, and on the Florida Keys. Most Calusa villages were located at the mouths of rivers or on key islands. The Calusa were hunter-gatherers who lived on small game, fish, turtles, alligators, shellfish, and various plants. Most of their <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> made of bone or teeth, although sharpened reeds were also effective for hunting or war. Calusa weapons consisted of bows and arrows, atlatls, and spears. Canoes were used for transportation, and South Florida tribes often canoed through the Everglades, but rarely lived in them. Canoe trips to Cuba were also common.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of journaling as a therapeutic and teaching <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> well documented. However, specific examples {{of school counselors}} utilizing journaling as a therapeutic <b>tool</b> <b>are</b> sparse. Existing school counseling literature was reviewed and journaling as an educational and therapeutic <b>tool</b> <b>was</b> explored and related to the school counseling environment. Suggestions for using journaling as an effective school counseling resource were offered and possible applications of online and paper and pencil journaling as a school counseling <b>tool</b> <b>were</b> presented...|$|R
50|$|Needle <b>tools</b> <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} used for embossing details, but mostly {{are used for}} perforating to make decorative, lace-like patterns. Needle tools have either single or multiple points and are used for different purposes. A single needle <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> used for embossing or stippling. A 2 needle <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> used for even perforations for marking areas which are to be cut with scissors. A 4 needle <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> square-shaped and a necessity for classic lace patterns. 3,5,7 and half-circle needle <b>tools</b> <b>are</b> used for decorative additions to lace patterns. A scissors is used in combination with needle tools to cut crosses and slots into the patterning.|$|R

All this enables one {{to talk about the}} UniMod as of the implementation of executable UML.|$|R
5|$|Gustav {{had only}} {{effects on the}} Lesser Antilles. Large swells, light rain, and gusty winds were {{reported}} along the outer fringes of the hurricane. On August30, the Egyptian motorship Raseltin encountered rough seas in relation to Gustav, and the hull of the ship was damaged. The remnants of Gustav severely impacted a seismic research operation {{off the coast of}} the United Kingdom which took place between August25 and September12. The purpose of the operation was to collect seismic reflection profiles of the Rockfall Plateau. On September3, the members of the team had to quickly retrieve all buoys that were deployed to avoid damage to the sensors. However, some of the research <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> damaged before they were recovered. In all, the storm delayed the project by two days.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this increasing competition, natural ice companies examined various options. Some invested in plant ice themselves. New <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> brought in {{to speed up the}} harvesting of ice, but these efficiency improvements were outstripped by technical advances in plant ice manufacture. The Natural Ice Association of America was formed to promote the benefits of natural ice, and companies played on the erroneous belief amongst customers that natural ice melted less slowly than manufactured ice. Under pressure, some ice companies attempted to exploit their local monopolies on ice distribution networks to artificially raise prices for urban customers. One of the most prominent cases of this involved Charles Morse and his American Ice Company, which suddenly almost tripled wholesale and doubled the retail prices in New York in 1900 {{in the midst of a}} heat wave; this created a scandal that caused Morse to sell up his assets in the ice trade altogether to escape prosecution, making a profit of $12 million ($320 million) in the process.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl {{hypothesized}} that the Pacific was settled by voyages from South America {{and set out to}} prove that with his Kon-Tiki expedition. Scholars did not take Heyerdahl's hypothesis seriously. New Zealander Andrew Sharp proposed the accidental voyaging hypothesis in 1957, which (erroneously) argued that Oceania was too vast to have been settled by intentional voyaging so migrations must have happened by accidental drift voyages. Sharp granted that Polynesians likely settled the Pacific from Asia, but held the opinion that their crude vessels and navigational <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> not reliable for intentional sailing from Tahiti to Hawaii or New Zealand. He stated that voyages of more than 300 miles were likely accidental voyages, with landfall at the mercy of wind and current. A 1973 study and computer simulation by Levison, Ward, and Web investigated the probability of Sharp's hypothesis but found it improbable.|$|E

5000|$|The exact {{origin of}} the claw <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> not well documented, however most in the FDNY agree on its folklorish origin. As the story goes, a fire was started in a lower Manhattan bank in order to {{cover-up}} a burglary. Within the rubble, firefighters found an odd tool with a claw-like end. Upon investigation, {{it was determined that}} the <b>tool</b> <b>was</b> used by the burglars to break into the bank. The firefighters had thought that if the <b>tool</b> <b>was</b> good enough to break into a bank, it was good enough for their use. This unusual <b>tool</b> <b>was</b> labeled [...] "The claw tool". Soon the claw <b>tool</b> <b>was</b> reproduced many times over, and became the primary forcible entry tool used by the FDNY. It is believed that the claw <b>tool</b> <b>was</b> the first <b>tool</b> designed solely for forcible entry.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Sociology, 2005 An {{evaluation}} of the Humboldt County Juvenile Detention Risk Assessment <b>Tool</b> <b>was</b> conducted. Those probation officers that use the <b>tool</b> <b>were</b> interviewed to determine {{if all of the}} parts of the <b>tool</b> <b>are</b> functional and if the <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> operating as {{it is supposed to be}} operating. The interview questions focused on the methods in which the probation officers fill out the tool, as well as focusing on the officer???s attitudes toward the <b>tool.</b> It can <b>be</b> concluded from this evaluation that the tool would operate effectively if more uniformity existed in the way in which the <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> filled out. This can be accomplished by formulating policies on how to address certain sections of the tool...|$|R
5|$|The RLM {{considered}} {{setting up}} production facilities in Slovakia. But this would delay production until {{the buildings and}} factories could be furnished with the machine tools. These <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> also in short supply, and the RLM hoped to purchase them from Switzerland and Italy. The Slovaks could provide 3,500–4,000 workers, but no technical personnel. The move would only produce another 25 machines per month {{at a time when}} demand was increasing. In October, production plans were dealt another blow when one of WFGs plants burned down, leaving a chronic shortage of tailwheels and undercarriage parts. Junkers director and member of the Luftwaffe industry council Carl Frytag reported that by January 1943 only 120 Ju 87s could be produced at Bremen and 230 at Berlin-Tempelhof.|$|E
5|$|The art was {{developed}} by Paul Drummond, Kevin Preston, Maria Drummond, Jeff Wall, and Karen Pinchin. This team were based at a studio in Manchester, rather than Birmingham, the central studio. Their work included character animations, developed in Autodesk Animator using its language POCO, which the graphics <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> built in. The artwork (including the sprites) was made as a selection of clips, and a final image was formed by pasting them together. The ability to use clips in multiple locations, and the colour information being stored separately and used on an as--needed basis meant that the art took much less space than was usual. The background artwork was sketched in black and white, and then scanned into a computer and colourised. The music is credited to Media Sorcery.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of human activity on the site pre-dating the Iron Age, {{as far back as}} 8,0006,000BC. During this period Mellor may have been a knap site where flint <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> produced, and also may have been a seasonal camp. Over 200lithics have been recovered and range from the early to the late Mesolithic. A high proportion of the flints are bladed tools, indicating that the people who produced them were hunter gatherers. Bronze Age artefacts are rare on the site, and there is no definitive indication of habitation in this period. Despite this, {{it is likely that the}} long-term habitation of the site had its roots in the late Bronze Age.|$|E

50|$|There are {{different}} types of form tools. Insert form <b>tools</b> <b>are</b> the most common for short- to medium-range jobs (50 to 20,000 pcs). Circular form <b>tools</b> <b>are</b> usually for longer jobs, since the <b>tool</b> wear can <b>be</b> ground off the tool tip many times as the <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> rotated in its holder. There is also a skiving <b>tool</b> that can <b>be</b> used for light finishing cuts. Form <b>tools</b> can <b>be</b> made of cobalt steel, carbide, or high-speed steel. Carbide requires additional care because it is very brittle and will chip if chatter occurs.|$|R
