500|$|As president, Coolidge's {{reputation}} as a quiet man continued. [...] "The words of a President have an enormous weight," [...] he would later write, [...] "and {{ought not to be}} used indiscriminately." [...] Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation; indeed, he cultivated it. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> want a solemn ass as a President," [...] he once told Ethel Barrymore, [...] "and I think I will go along with them." [...] Some historians would later suggest that Coolidge's image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic, while others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural, deepening {{after the death of his}} son in 1924.|$|E

2500|$|He told reporters, [...] "the vice {{president}} expressed {{the concern that}} a review of what happened on September 11 would take resources and personnel away from the effort {{in the war on}} terrorism. I acknowledged that concern, and it is for that reason that the Intelligence Committee is going to begin this effort, trying to limit the scope and the overall review of what happened.

5000|$|Later that month, U.S. President Barack Obama was {{dismissive of}} Snowden, saying, [...] "I'm {{not going to}} be {{scrambling}} jets to get a 29-year-old hacker." [...] In early August, Obama said that Snowden was no patriot and that Americans {{would have been better off}} if they had remained unaware of the NSA surveillance activities that Snowden revealed. Obama also said that he had [...] "called for a thorough review of our surveillance operations before Mr. Snowden made these leaks.... My preference, and I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people's</b> preference, would have been for a lawful, orderly examination of these laws; a thoughtful fact-based debate that would then lead us to a better place." ...|$|R
5000|$|After the shooting, Parker was {{approached}} with several commercial offers, including from one company {{who wanted to}} sell his photograph. He refused, stating in a newspaper interview that [...] "I do not <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> would like me to make capital out of the unfortunate circumstances. I am glad that I {{was able to be}} of service to the country." [...] Prior to McKinley's death, when his outlook for recovery appeared promising, the Savannah Tribune, an African-American newspaper, trumpeted of Parker [...] "the life of our chief magistrate was saved by a Negro. No other class of citizens is more loyal to this country than the Negro." ...|$|R
5000|$|In August 2013, President Obama {{said that}} he had called for a review of U.S. {{surveillance}} activities before Snowden had begun revealing details of the NSA's operations: [...] "My preference, and I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people's</b> preference, would have been for a lawful, orderly examination of these laws; a thoughtful fact-based debate that would then lead us to a better place." [...] Obama announced that he was directing DNI James Clapper [...] "to establish a review group on intelligence and communications technologies" [...] that would brief and later report to Obama. In December, the task force issued 46 recommendations that, if adopted, would subject the NSA to additional scrutiny by the courts, Congress, and the president, and would strip the NSA of the authority to infiltrate American computer systems using [...] "backdoors" [...] in hardware or software. Panel member Geoffrey R. Stone said {{there was no evidence that}} the bulk collection of phone data had stopped any terror attacks. In July 2014, The Washington Post reported that, according to a large cache of NSA-intercepted conversations provided by Edward Snowden, months of tracking by the NSA of communications across more than 50 alias Internet accounts [...] "led directly to the 2011 capture in Abbottabad of Muhammad Tahir Shahzad, a Pakistan-based bomb builder, and Umar Patek, a suspect in a 2002 terrorist bombing on the Indonesian island of Bali." [...] The Post said that, at the request of CIA officials, it was [...] "withholding other examples that officials said would compromise ongoing operations." ...|$|R

[...] She added that [...] "I <b>think</b> what <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August, when the relief wells will be finished." [...] Mike Allen of Politico later wrote that [...] "Browner's calm, authoritative television presence during the BP oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the Gulf catastrophe." ...|$|R

He appeared before constituents of Eric Cantor's congressional district to press the Congress to pass his bill immediately. On September 12, he gave a speech in the White House Rose Garden {{in front of a}} group of teachers, police officers, construction workers and small-business owners in which he stated that [...] "if Congress does not act, just about every family in America will pay more taxes next year. That would be a self-inflicted wound that our economy just cannot afford right now." [...] In Speaker Boehner's home state of Ohio, Obama gave a speech described as [...] "fiery" [...] in a Columbus high school that led to the audience chanting: [...] "Pass this bill!" [...] In a campaign-style rally at North Carolina State University, Obama told college students [...] "Every single one of you can help make this bill a reality. The time for hand-wringing is over. The time for moping around is over. We've got to kick off our bedroom slippers and put on our marching shoes." [...] At a black-tie dinner for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, Obama pitched his jobs plan to Latinos. In an October press conference, Obama responded to the suggestion from a reporter that his jobs tour was part of a political campaign, saying [...] "The question is, will Congress do something? If Congress does something, then I can't run against a 'do nothing' Congress. If Congress does nothing, then it's not a matter of me running against them.
