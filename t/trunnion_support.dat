40|$|A {{subcritical}} {{liquid hydrogen}} orbital storage and transfer experiment {{was designed for}} flight in the Shuttle cargo bay. The Cryogenic Fluid Management Experiment (CFME) includes a liquid hydrogen tank supported in a vacuum jacket by two fiberglass epoxy trunnion mounts. This composite material was selected for the trunnions since it provides desirable strength, weight and thermal characteristics for supporting cryogenic tankage. An experimental program was conducted to provide material property and fatigue data for S-glass epoxy composite materials at ambient and liquid hydrogen temperatures and to verify structural integrity of the CFME <b>trunnion</b> <b>supports...</b>|$|R
50|$|The tubular cradle pivoted by the <b>trunnions</b> <b>supported</b> {{the barrel}} - a wire bound A tube - and {{connected}} {{it to the}} hydro-pneumatic recoil system with a floating piston (the first British use of this) and hydraulic buffer. However, the initial design suffered from excessive recoil and was modified in 1916. In 1917 the recoil was further improved by addition of a recoil indicator and cut-off gear. Full recoil (40-inch Mk I, 44-inch Mk II) was allowed at lower elevation, hence absorbing most of the horizontal (i.e. backward) force. A shorter recoil (23-inch Mk I, 20-inch Mk II) was allowed at high elevation where the ground itself could absorb much of the vertical (i.e. downward) recoil force. This prevented the breech from hitting the platform. The barrel had to be depressed 3° for loading, {{as can be seen}} in the photograph, shown below, of a howitzer of the Australian 55th Siege Battery.|$|R
50|$|It is the easternmost bridge {{spanning}} the canal. The bridge is 344 ft long, and {{was designed by}} Carl F. Gould, {{one of the original}} architects of the University of Washington campus. The bridge and its control towers were designed in conjunction with the university's Collegiate Gothic style. It provides a clearance of 46 ft and is reported as providing 48 ft of vertical clearance above the mean regulated level of Lake Washington for the central 100 ft of the bascule span. It is one of four original bascule-type drawbridges over the Ship Canal, the others being the Ballard, Fremont, and University Bridges. It was the last one to be completed, has the highest clearance of the four, and {{is the only one that}} is part of the state highway system. It is also one of six bascule bridges based on a design derived from the Chicago bascule bridge, but is unique because of its <b>trunnion</b> <b>supports,</b> employed to avoid a patent infringement lawsuit by the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company.|$|R
50|$|The bells {{are mounted}} within a bellframe of steel or wood. Each bell is {{suspended}} from a headstock fitted on trunnions (plain or non-friction bearings) mounted to the belfry framework {{so that the}} bell assembly can rotate. When stationary in the down position, the centre of mass of the bell and clapper is appreciably below the centreline of the <b>trunnion</b> <b>supports,</b> giving a pendulous effect to the assembly, and this dynamic {{is controlled by the}} ringer's rope. The headstock is fitted with a wooden stay, which, in conjunction with a slider, limits maximum rotational movement to a little less than 370 degrees. To the headstock a large wooden wheel is fitted and to which a rope is attached. The rope wraps and unwraps as the bell rotates backwards and forwards. This is full circle ringing and quite different from fixed or limited motion bells, which chime. Within the bell the clapper is constrained to swing in the direction that the bell swings. The clapper is a rigid steel or wrought iron bar with a large ball to strike the bell. The thickest part of the mouth of bell is called the soundbow and it is against this that the ball strikes. Beyond the ball is a flight, which controls the speed of the clapper. In very small bells this can be nearly as long {{as the rest of the}} clapper.|$|R
40|$|Following the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), the Systems Special Investigation Group (SIG) was {{involved}} in a considerable amount of testing of mechanical hardware flown on the LDEF.

50|$|The gun {{carriage}} provides a stable, yet mobile, {{base for the}} gun. The new split-trail carriage featured an eight-wheel integral two-axle bogie and a two-wheel limber that supported the trails for transport. The carriage was a two-piece design. The upper carriage included the side frames with <b>trunnion</b> bearings that <b>supported</b> the recoil mechanism that carried the gun cradle, slide and gun tube. The upper carriage also incorporated the elevating and azimuth gearing. The upper carriage pivoted in azimuth on the lower carriage. The lower carriage included the transport suspension and the split-trail that stabilized and absorbed recoil when the gun was fired.|$|R
50|$|The Mill Basin Bridge is {{a double}} leaf <b>trunnion</b> bascule bridge <b>supporting</b> the Belt Parkway over Mill Basin. Each leaf carries six lanes of traffic—three in each direction. There is a {{sidewalk}} {{on each side of}} the leaf; the eastern or downstream one being part of the Shore Parkway Greenway. Built in the 1940s, the bridge, which cost $1.4 million, is the only drawbridge on the Belt Parkway. The New York City Department of Transportation reconstructed the Belt Parkway Bridge over Mill Basin in late 2006. The bridge was constructed in 1942 and had outlived its useful service life. Due to the effects of age, weather and increased traffic volume, reconstruction was deemed necessary. The reconstruction work was accomplished in two stages.|$|R

The completed bridge had its bascule leaves pivot on trunnions located [...] {{from the end of}} the girders. The bridge's reinforced-concrete counterweights, measuring [...] high by [...] wide, was supported by pivots at the ends of the girders. The <b>trunnions</b> were <b>supported</b> by box-girder posts on the sides of the bascule leaves and each set of inside trunnion posts were braced by a girder ran both between them and to the operating mechanism. Earle Gear and Machine Company provided the operating mechanism for the bridge. The bascule leaves were raised by a motor that used reduction gears and engaged a pinion to move the rack quadrant to raise the bridge. A manual-operation shaft was originally present so that it could be operated from the surface of the roadway, but it was later paved over. The operator's house was located on the south side of the western approach, it originally housed the operator's house and public bathrooms, but it was removed in 1936. The plans originally dictated for a second station on the opposite end, but 1930s photos shows it was apparently never constructed.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Catastrophic {{failure of}} post-tension {{trunnion}} anchor rods at dams {{is an ongoing}} problem caused by propagating orthogonal stress corrosion cracks described in CHETN-IX- 32 (Evans et al. 2013). This condition is shown in Figure 1 which presents a cracked rod that was removed from Robert F. Henry Lock and Dam, which has 376 <b>trunnion</b> rods <b>supporting</b> the tainter gates. In the broken rod image, a blue arrow indicates the fracture origin, and white arrows indicate the crack propagating direction. The green ellipse encircles an area that contains a pre-existing crack. This older crack area is more heavily oxidized {{than the rest of}} the fracture surface. This crack over time resulted in the complete failure of the rod. The right side of Figure 1 shows the tainter gate trunnion rods located on a dam pier. These rods serve to prestress the concrete to prevent excessive tensile loading on the concrete during gate operation. Figure 1. Cracked trunnion rod from Robert F. Henry Lock and Dam In addition, CHETN-IX- 32 provides background information and initial test-bed investigations of nonlinear and guided-wave methods directed at development of a non-destructive testing capability for long-distance microcrack detection in embedded trunnion rods.

50|$|Within the spherical joint, {{the main}} tube is led through {{a kind of}} guide tube, which is capable of turning, in a {{vertical}} plane, upon side trunnions; These <b>trunnions</b> being <b>supported</b> by bearings which work in vertical guides, and are capable of being raised or lowered by the arrangement shown in Fig. 2. This arrangement is as follows: From each bearing a chain is led, over a guide pulley situated {{at the top of}} the guide belonging to that bearing, to an arm fixed on a rocking-shaft placed close to the floor of the vessel. On this rocking-shaft there is also fixed another arm, and from this a chain proceeds aft to the piston rod of a horizontal steam cylinder, placed as shown in Fig. 2. This cylinder is provided with a slide valve, by which the steam can be admitted to or released from the forward end of the cylinder at pleasure; and, when the steam is so admitted, it drives back the piston, and, by means of the arrangement of chains and rocking-shaft already described, raised the guide tube, through which the main tube passes, and thus depresses that end of the latter which carries the torpedo. The extent to which the piston in the steam cylinder is driven back, and, consequently, the extent to which the guide tube is raised, is regulated by means of a screw which passes through the back cylinder cover, this screw, which is furnished with a handwheel and check-nut, forming a stop against which the piston rests when driven back by the steam.|$|R
