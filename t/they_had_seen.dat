5|$|From 1998, I {{started coming}} across people {{who told me}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> people change into a {{non-human}} form. It's an age-old phenomenon known as shape-shifting. The basic form is like a scaly humanoid, with reptilian rather than humanoid eyes.|$|E
5|$|According {{to another}} legend, two Parmars from Malwa, named Govinddas and Madhavdas, took up their haunt among the rush grass {{that covered the}} {{neighbourhood}} of the Rudra Mahalaya, and lived by plunder. There they found the foundations of a temple and Shiva linga, and {{said that in the}} night <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> heavenly beings. This was told to Siddharaj and led to the erection or completion of the temple.|$|E
5|$|After his {{marriage}} to Yanti, she ended her singing career to become a housewife. When the couple had children, Chrisye often had little {{time to spend with}} them as he was busy performing or recording; however, he attempted to spend as much time with them as possible. In a 1992 interview, he said that his children did not want to follow in their parents' footsteps and become singers because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the stresses it put on the family.|$|E

5|$|Between January 2010 and 2015, {{a quarter}} of {{emergency}} room doctors said <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> a major surge in patients, while nearly half had seen a smaller increase. Seven in ten ER doctors claimed that they lacked the resources to deal with large increases {{in the number of}} patients. The biggest factor in the increased number of ER patients was insufficient primary care providers to handle the larger number of insured patients.|$|E
5|$|Bok {{went to the}} market, {{where he}} heard adults say that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> smoke coming from nearby villages and had heard gunfire in the distance. People began fleeing the market as Francis saw {{horsemen}} with machine guns. The gunmen surrounded the market and shot the men in Nyamlell. The raiders {{were part of an}} Islamic militia from the northern part of Sudan that conducted periodic raids on the villages of their Dinka neighbors, who were Christians or animists of Sub-Saharan African descent.|$|E
5|$|German {{citizens}} (despite much of {{the later}} denial) had access to information about what was happening, as soldiers returning from the occupied territories would report on what <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> and done. Evans states that most German citizens disapproved of the genocide. Some Polish citizens tried to rescue or hide the remaining Jews {{and members of the}} Polish underground got word to their government in exile in London as to what was happening.|$|E

5|$|John Surratt stood {{trial in}} Washington in 1867. Four {{residents}} of Elmira, New York, claimed <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> him there between April 13 and 15; fifteen others said they either saw him, {{or someone who}} resembled him, in Washington (or traveling to or from Washington) {{on the day of}} the assassination. The jury could not reach a verdict and John Surratt was released.|$|E
5|$|Lawyers for the {{prosecution}} suspected that the Miguel who had recruited the mercenaries was Michel Dominguez, a Spanish police officer of French origin who worked with Amedo. In April 1990 a waiter at Londres Hotel and a security employee at the Kursaal casino in San Sebastián both stated that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> Amedo and Dominguez on various occasions {{in the company of}} Mattei and other GAL mercenaries.|$|E
5|$|Andjar {{was born}} Abisin Abbas in Alahan Panjang, West Sumatra, on 26February 1902. He gravitated toward {{traditional}} theatre {{at a young}} age after visits from the wandering Wayang Kassim and Juliana Opera stambul troupes; he pretended to act with his friends in stage plays which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b> After completing his formal education up to the Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (junior high school) level– first in Malay-language schools then Dutch ones– he moved to Batavia (modern-day Jakarta). He worked as a reporter for two daily newspapers, Bintang Timoer and Bintang Hindia; he may have also worked on a farm.|$|E

5|$|Food {{is mostly}} {{selected}} by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey triggers a feeding response. Frogs {{have been caught}} on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs (Rana clamitans) have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> floating past. Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.|$|E
5|$|Game one {{was held}} in Montreal in a very warm Montreal Forum on September 2 before 18,818 fans. The gamesmanship between the teams started before the first faceoff. Canada was {{assigned}} the home team for all games in Canada, while the Soviets would be the home team in Moscow. The Soviets would not release their lineup until <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> their opponents', the opposite order, considering they were the visitors. The official scorer {{had to return to}} the Soviets' dressing room and demand the lineup. To Sinden, he wanted to put the Ellis-Clarke-Henderson line on against Valeri Kharlamov's line. The Soviets did not start Kharlamov's line and Sinden named Phil Esposito's line for the opening face-off.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, the WSB's {{spokesman}} {{stated that}} the remaining six members of the patrol, who had now been held for over a fortnight, would only be released after a new government was formed in Sierra Leone, leading negotiators {{to conclude that the}} increasingly unrealistic demands were stalling tactics rather than a serious attempt to conclude the crisis. At around the same time, teams that had been observing the West Side Boys' base for four days reported that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> no sign of the captive soldiers in that time. There were also concerns that an assault would become more dangerous if the West Side Boys moved the hostages. The combination of these factors led COBRA to order an extraction mission.|$|E

5|$|One day, {{he returns}} to Panyeredan to visit his family with Anwar. While there, Anwar sees some night watchmen quivering in fear near a {{cemetery}}. When told that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> a ghost, Anwar enters the cemetery with Hasan to disprove its existence. However, Hasan thinks he sees a ghost and runs away frightened. When ridiculed for this by Anwar, Hasan's faith is broken. This leads {{him to have a}} large fight with his family about their Islamic faith, which results in Hasan's family disowning him. Upon his return to Bandung, Hasan marries Kartini.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month they traveled east, hoping {{to locate the}} Mississippi and return to Canada. During their travels, the group encountered the Caddo, who gave the Frenchmen a map depicting their territory, that of their neighbors, {{and the location of}} the Mississippi River. The Caddo often made friendship pacts with neighboring peoples and extended their policy of peaceful negotiation to the French. While visiting the Caddo, the French met Jumano traders, who reported on the activities of the Spanish in New Mexico. These traders later informed Spanish officials of the Frenchmen <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E
5|$|If tanks or a {{large number}} of troops were seen passing, they would radio the LRDG {{headquarters}} at Siwa immediately so that by the time the enemy reached the front line, GHQ at Cairo would know they were coming. Once a patrol was relieved they would transmit details of all <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> back to Siwa. The LRDG did not lose any men or vehicles when on the road watch, but they did have some close encounters. On 21 March 'R1' Patrol was surrounded by a convoy of 27 vehicles and about 200 men who stopped for the night between the watchers and their vehicles. While the road watch was ongoing, other patrols would be attacking targets along other stretches of the Tripoli to Benghazi road, by planting mines or attacking vehicles with machine gun fire. The road was kept under constant observation around the clock from 2 March to 21 July 1942.|$|E

5|$|In September 1940, 237 Squadron was {{relieved}} by {{units of the}} South Arican Air Force and redeployed in Sudan, where the Operations Record {{for the last three}} months of 1940 showed it was involved in reconnaissance, dive-bombing and pamphlet-dropping. At the start of 1941, the Squadron was re-equipped with less antiquated aircraft. The Hardys were replaced by Westland Lysander II army co-operation planes as well as Gloster Gladiator fighter biplanes. 237 Squadron moved out of East Africa after the defeat of the Italians in May 1941. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> active service in Kenya, Sudan, Eritrea and Abyssinia. The Squadron was involved in the Western Desert Campaign against Rommel. After a lull in the summer of 1941, it took heavy casualties in the closing months inflicted on it by Me109F and Macchis. It was withdrawn to the Canal Zone in February 1942 after five months in the Western Desert.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, McGovern {{joined the}} 741st Squadron of the 455th Bombardment Group of the Fifteenth Air Force, {{stationed}} at San Giovanni Airfield near Cerignola in the Apulia region of Italy. There {{he and his}} crew found a starving, disease-ridden local population wracked by the ill fortunes of war and far worse off than anything <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> back home during the Depression. Those sights would form part of his later motivation to fight hunger. Starting on November 11, 1944, McGovern flew 35missions over enemy territory from San Giovanni, the first five as co-pilot for an experienced crew and the rest as pilot for his own plane, known as the Dakota Queen after his wife Eleanor. His targets were in Austria; Czechoslovakia; Nazi Germany; Hungary; Poland; and northern, German-controlled Italy, and were often either oil refinery complexes or rail marshalling yards, all {{as part of the}} U.S.strategic bombing campaign in Europe. The eight- or nine-hour missions were grueling tests of endurance for pilots and crew, and while German fighter aircraft were a diminished threat by this time as compared to earlier in the war, his missions often faced heavy anti-aircraft artillery fire that filled the sky with flak bursts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1921–22, Hammond, needing work, signed to play {{professional}} football for Bristol Rovers F.C. in Division Three South, following his success at school and in the Bristol Downs Football League. After {{some time in the}} reserves, he made four appearances for the first team that season. He played in ten games the following season, and four times in 1923–24. His usual position was on the right wing. Despite scoring twice in his career, he never showed much enthusiasm for the game and was cautious around tackles, mindful that his main career was cricket. He was criticised in the local press for his role in two defeats shortly before his final appearance. After he was left out of the team, he never played again and left the club, deciding that he could not play two sports professionally. Even so, the Rovers' trainer, Bert Williams, and manager, Andy Wilson, believed that Hammond, one of the fastest players <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> at the club, would have had the potential to play international football.|$|E
