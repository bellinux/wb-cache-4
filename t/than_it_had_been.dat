5|$|Land warfare {{changed from}} the static front lines of World WarI to {{increased}} mobility and combined arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon. In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> during World War I, and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.|$|E
5|$|Much like Within the Woods, The Evil Dead {{needed to}} be blown up to 35mm, then the {{industry}} standard, to be played at movie theaters. The relatively large budget made this a much simpler process with The Evil Dead <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> with the short film.|$|E
5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} {{moved into the}} southern celestial hemisphere. The comet was much less impressive to southern hemisphere observers <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the northern hemisphere, but southerners {{were able to see}} the comet gradually fade from view {{during the second half of}} 1997. The last naked-eye observations were reported in December 1997, which meant that the comet had remained visible without aid for 569days, or about 18 and a half months. The previous record had been set by the Great Comet of 1811, which was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.|$|E
25|$|Imports of {{petroleum}} products fell from 1.85% GDP in 2009 to 0.86% GDP in 2016. The U.S. was less reliant {{on foreign oil}} <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in nearly 30 years.|$|R
50|$|The December 2007 {{timetable}} {{brought about}} significant changes, {{and the service}} <b>is</b> now better <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> since the mid-1980s when there was an hourly Nunthorpe - Middlesbrough service including seven Whitby trains.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{controversial}} research by Gregory Clark {{has indicated that}} social mobility <b>has</b> <b>been</b> consistently low but non-negligible throughout history, and that social mobility was no lower in previous centuries <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in recent times.|$|R
5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} old wool {{industry}} in Frome declined, although the last fabric mill at Wallsbridge did not close until 1965. As a result, the population fell {{and in the}} 1930s it was slightly smaller <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the mid 19th century. Other industries such as printing, light engineering, metal casting, carpeting and dairying continued, many taking old premises from the cloth mills and others being sited at the new Marston Road Trading Estate which led to growth after World War II, including the construction of council houses.|$|E
5|$|In 215 Caracalla {{introduced}} the antoninianus, a coin intended {{to serve as}} a double denarius. This new currency, however, had a silver purity of about 52% for the period between 215 and 217 and an actual size ratio of 1antoninianus to 1.5denarii. This in effect made the antoninianus equal to about 1.5denarii. The reduced silver purity of the coins caused people to hoard the old coins that had higher silver content, making the inflation problem caused by the earlier devaluation of the denarii worse <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> before.|$|E
5|$|In round four, Judah {{landed a}} {{right hand to}} the head that caused Mayweather to retreat to the ropes and cover up. The {{momentum}} changed in the fifth round, when Mayweather hurt Judah with a combination to the face. Then Mayweather landed a right hand {{on the bridge of}} Judah's nose, and blood began to flow. The seventh round was the most dominant for Mayweather to that point. Once again, he drew blood from Judah's nose. A combination from Mayweather backed Judah into a corner, and Judah's foot movement was considerably slower <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> earlier in the fight.|$|E
25|$|Eton {{today is}} a larger school <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> for much of its history. In 1678, there were 207 boys. In the late 18th century, there were about 300, while today, the total has risen to over 1,300.|$|R

5000|$|If it {{were ever}} {{reasonable}} to {{wish that the}} usage of words <b>had</b> <b>been</b> other <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> ... one might be inclined to wish that the term 'freedom' <b>had</b> <b>been</b> confined to the ... power to do what one wills.|$|R
5|$|Speakers at {{the inquiry}} have also testified that a {{significant}} volume of city traffic regularly cut across the roof deck as a bypass of the traffic lights {{at the corner of}} Hillside Drive and Ontario Avenue, resulting in more stress on the structure <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> designed to handle. The NORR report speculated that a heavy vehicle might have contributed to a previously undetected partial failure of the support structure a few months prior to the final collapse.|$|E
5|$|The Atlas booster {{had been}} {{modified}} since the previous flight, and now included baffled fuel injectors {{and a new}} hypergolic fuel igniter instead of the original pyrotechnic igniter. This would completely eliminate problems with combustion instability and allow the booster to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held on the pad for a few moments. The factory testing and checkout process for MA-8's booster, while still a lengthy affair taking several months (partially due to the new propulsion system), was nonetheless easier and shorter <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> for any previous Mercury-Atlas vehicle as engineers gained more experience with the hardware and coordination between contractors improved.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{defense was}} less {{statistically}} successful in 2010 <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in previous years, but the Hokies still {{led the nation}} in turnover margin, forcing 16 more turnovers than they gave away. Sophomore cornerback Jayron Hosley, a first-team All-ACC selection, {{led the nation in}} interceptions with eight, while Davon Morgan and Rashad Carmichael each had four. Tech's defense ranked 10th in the red zone, seven spots ahead of the Seminoles' defense in that respect. In total defense, the Hokies were 42nd, permitting an average of 349 yards per game. In scoring defense, Tech was third in the ACC, permitting 17.9points per game.|$|E

50|$|Although the Italian {{language}} {{is much less}} used today <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> previously, there are still several Italian-only media outlets, among which are the St. Louis newspaper Il Pensiero and the New Jersey daily paper America Oggi and ICN Radio.|$|R
5000|$|A liberal think tank, The Center for Economic and Policy Research, {{says that}} [...] "Social Security is more financially sound today <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{throughout}} most of its 69-year history" [...] and that Bush's statement should have no credibility.|$|R
5|$|A {{special session}} of the {{legislature}} in 1965 changed the Senate to represent 16 districts and reapportioned the seats, again by county, but did so {{in such a way}} as to make the representation more proportional to population <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been.</b> Thus, the eastern shore, which had previously elected nine Senators, elected only four after 1965. This was done to preserve the ideal of having whole counties represented by a single Senator, rather than breaking counties up into multiple districts. A constitutional amendment in 1972 expanded the Senate to 47 members, elected from districts proportional to the population. These districts are reapportioned every ten years based on the United States Census to ensure they remain proportional.|$|E
5|$|In September 1980, in the {{aftermath}} of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by Stanisław Kania. Kania made promises of the sort that Gomułka and Gierek had made when each came power. But whatever goodwill the new leader gained, it lasted for an even shorter period <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the case in 1956 and 1971, because there was no way that the regime could have kept the promises it had made at Gdańsk, even if it wanted to. The authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. GNP fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8% and in 1981 by 15–20%.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-pressure}} oxygen {{atmosphere was}} consistent with that {{that had been used}} successfully in the Mercury and Gemini programs. The pressure before launch was deliberately greater than ambient in order to drive out the nitrogen-containing air and replace it with pure oxygen, and also to seal the plug door hatch cover. During launch, the pressure would have been gradually reduced to the in-flight level of , providing sufficient oxygen for the astronauts to breathe while reducing the fire risk. The Apollo 1 crew had successfully tested this procedure with their spacecraft in the Operations and Checkout Building altitude (vacuum) chamber on October 18 and 19, 1966, and the backup crew of Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham had repeated it on December 30. The investigation board noted that, during these tests, the Command Module had been fully pressurized with pure oxygen four times, for a total of six hours and fifteen minutes, {{two and a half hours}} longer <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> during the plugs-out test.|$|E

50|$|This policy {{costs the}} Government {{more money to}} implement, and the {{expected}} proportion of each GP visit paid by the Government <b>is</b> higher <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> previously.

50|$|Kennebec County's economy <b>has</b> {{traditionally}} <b>been</b> industrial. A {{large amount}} of paper and textiles were produced, and mills sprung up all along the Kennebec river. The median household income is currently $36,498. The unemployment rate is currently at 4.2% (lower <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in a year).|$|R
5|$|The highest {{recorded}} {{population for}} Shapinsay is 974, in 1881. Since then, {{the population of}} the island has steadily declined; {{less than a third of}} that number was recorded in the 2001 census. The rate of absolute population loss was lower in the last decades of the 20th century <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the first half of that century. In 2001, Shapinsay had a population of 300, a decline of 6.8% from 322 in 1991. This was greater than the population decline for Orkney overall in the same period, which was 1.9%. However, the loss in population on Shapinsay was less than that experienced by most Orkney islands, most of which experienced declines of more than 10%. The number of persons per hectare on Shapinsay was 0.1, similar to the 0.2 persons per hectare across Orkney. At the time of the 2011 census the usually resident population had increased to 307. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{hypothesis}} that snake venom had a single evolutionary origin, venom {{in a number of}} lineages of snakes subsequently atrophied. Evidence of such atrophication has been found in several snakes. A 2005 study in the marbled sea snake, Aipysurus eydouxii found that the gene for a three-fingered protein found in the venom had undergone a deletion of two nucleotide bases which made the venom 50-100 times less toxic <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> previously. This change was correlated with a change in diet from fish to a diet consisting almost entirely of fish eggs, suggesting that the adaptation to an egg diet had removed the selection pressure needed to maintain a highly toxic venom, allowing the venom genes to accumulate deleterious mutations. A similar venom degradation following a shift to an egg-based diet has been found in the Common egg-eater Dasypeltis scabra, whose diet consists entirely of birds' eggs, meaning that the snake had no use for its venom. This has led biologists to suggest that if venom is not used by a species, it is rapidly lost.|$|E
5|$|By April 1955 the Guatemalan government's foreign {{exchange}} reserves had declined from $42million {{at the end of}} 1954 to just $3.4million. The regime was thus facing difficulties borrowing money, leading to capital flight. The government also received criticism for the presence of black markets and other signs of approaching bankruptcy. By the end of 1954 the number of unemployed people in the country had risen to 20,000, four times higher <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> during the latter years of the Árbenz government. In April 1955 the Eisenhower administration approved an aid package of $53million and began to underwrite the debt of the Guatemalan government. Although officials in the USgovernment complained about Castillo Armas's incompetence and corruption, he also received praise in that country for acting against communists, and his human rights violations generally went unremarked. In 1955, during a corn famine, Castillo Armas gave corn import licences to some of his old fighters in return for a $25,000 bribe. The imported corn, upon inspection by the United Nations, turned out to be unfit for consumption. When a student newspaper exposed the story, Castillo Armas launched a police crackdown against those criticizing him. Castillo Armas returned some of the privileges that the United Fruit Company had had under Ubico, but the company did not benefit substantially from them; it went into a gradual decline following disastrous experiments with breeding and pesticides, falling demand, and an anti-trust action.|$|E

5|$|In the 1997 {{legislative}} elections the FN polled its best-ever {{result with}} 15.3% support in metropolitan France, confirming its {{position as the}} third most important political force in France. It also showed that the party had become established enough to compete without its leader, who {{decided not to run}} to focus on the 2002 presidential election. Although it won only one seat in the National Assembly (Toulon), thanks to a good communication director, it advanced to the second round in 132 constituencies. The FN was arguably more influential now <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in 1986 with its 35 seats. While Bruno Mégret and Bruno Gollnisch, in an unusual display of dissent, favoured tactical cooperation with a weakened centre-right following the left's victory, Le Pen rejected any such compromise. In the tenth FN national congress in 1997, Mégret stepped up his position in the party as its rising star and a potential leader following Le Pen. Le Pen however refused to designate Mégret as his successor-elect, and instead made his wife Jany the leader of the FN list for the upcoming European election.|$|E
5|$|MacMillan was in {{an awkward}} position. It was widely known that Ashton had been forced out, and many resented it. Company morale was lowered by an announcement, to which MacMillan and Field were party, that the two ballet {{companies}} would merge, with numerous job losses. The managerial side of the post was no more congenial to MacMillan <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in Berlin, and some felt that his creative work suffered during his seven-year term. His expansion of Anastasia into a three-act version (1971) and the other full-length work from this period, Manon (1974), divided opinion, receiving fiercely adverse reviews as well as laudatory ones. His Joplin ballet Elite Syncopations (1974) and Requiem (1976) were immediately successful and have been regularly revived. The latter was dedicated {{to the memory of}} Cranko, who had died suddenly in 1973. It was premiered at Stuttgart, because as with Song of the Earth the Royal Opera House board thought the chosen music – Fauré's Requiem – inappropriate for a ballet. The work was not given at Covent Garden until 1983.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 1/2 May, most of the {{remnants}} of the Berlin garrison attempted {{to break out of the}} city centre in three different directions. Only those that went west through the Tiergarten and crossed the Charlottenbrücke (a bridge over the Havel) into Spandau succeeded in breaching Soviet lines. Only a handful of those who survived the initial breakout made it to the lines of the Western Allies—most were either killed or captured by the Red Army's outer encirclement forces west of the city. Early in the morning of 2 May, the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery. The military historian Antony Beevor points out that as most of the German combat troops had left the area in the breakouts the night before, the resistance must have been far less <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> inside the Reichstag. General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 06:00 hours. He was taken to see General Vasily Chuikov at 08:23. Weidling agreed to order the city's defenders to surrender to the Soviets. Under General Chuikov's and Vasily Sokolovsky's direction, Weidling put his order to surrender in writing.|$|E
