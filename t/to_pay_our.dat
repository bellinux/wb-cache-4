5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>our</b> respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E

Albert explained: [...] "If you're on a summer holiday, you've got to come {{at this time of}} year. I've always wanted to come to Graceland. Charlene and my friends wanted to be here today for this visit, Elvis touched our lives as well and the lives of so many people.

6000|$|... "Your country," [...] Reist answered, hoarsely, [...] "has {{no great}} {{reputation}} for generosity. What are we <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for <b>our</b> freedom? You {{would not have}} me {{believe that there is}} no price." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} Rainbow's Daughter, [...] "that {{is too high}} a price <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> <b>Our</b> friend's straw is nice and fresh, for he was restuffed only a little while ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have only}} lost twenty," [...] the general said, [...] "and {{most of those}} were killed while serving the guns. That was a small price indeed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for <b>our</b> {{magnificent}} success." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis a {{heavy price}} <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for <b>our</b> sport," [...] said Considine sadly, as he stood with his companions gazing {{on the body of}} the Hottentot, which was trodden into a shapeless mass.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Benson, [...] "I don't suppose you'll turn us out, and we'd be glad <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for <b>our</b> accommodation. We have {{no wish to}} {{take the}} trail again without food or transport." ...|$|R
6000|$|W. Nay, hold, friend; I {{did not say}} {{we would}} come to him then: you talked of making him a present, that is <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>our</b> respects to him, is it not? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A very {{important}} fact," [...] said Captain Jarvis, sarcastically; [...] "Colonel Egerton and myself {{got as far}} as the village, <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>our</b> respects to him, when we heard he had gone on to town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, of course, that {{fixed the}} scheme. The women {{boarders}} all left the next morning. The landlord wouldn't {{speak to us}} for two days, but when he found we had money <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>our</b> way he loosened up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, dear, bestir yourself, for we must sail in {{ten days}} to pass our summer {{in or near}} Paris. I've got {{commissions}} enough <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>our</b> way, and we can unite business and pleasure in the most charming manner." ...|$|E

60|$|In a {{few moments}} we had settled it. Happily we were both in full dress, in case friends should have dropped in on us.

60|$|He that hath a Trade hath an Estate; and he that hath a Calling, hath an Office of Profit and Honor; {{but then}} the Trade must be worked at, and the Calling well followed, or neither the Estate nor the Office will enable us <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>our</b> Taxes.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{have to wait}} a while longer," [...] Teddy said decidedly. [...] "It won't do {{to knock}} off yet, 'cause we ought to make enough <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for <b>our</b> suppers between now an' dark. S'posin' you take some of these papers?
