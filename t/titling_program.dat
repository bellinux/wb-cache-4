5000|$|Following {{an initial}} {{proposal}} for a land <b>titling</b> <b>program</b> in 2000 by the opposition Justice First, influenced by the Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto Polar, President Hugo Chavez issued Presidential Decree 1666 in February 2002, providing a legal basis for Urban Land Committees (Comités de Tierras Urbanas, CTUs) to be formed. These develop land titling in urban areas. Under the February 2002 decree, local committees (representing 100-200 families) may apply to a government office for the local [...] "barrio" [...] residents to be given property title for state-owned land they have informally occupied on a long-term basis. The committees operate {{on the principle of}} participatory democracy, and create maps of the local area, on the basis of which (after official verification) land titles are drawn up. By mid-2005, there were around 5000 CTUs, representing around 5m Venezuelans, and the government had issued over 84,000 titles to 126,000 families, benefiting about 630,000 inhabitants (out of a total urban poor population of around 10m). By October 2006 the government said that over 200,000 titles had been assigned, benefiting about 1m inhabitants.|$|E

40|$|One {{intervention}} {{intended to}} ameliorate poverty and its subsidiary effects is {{the distribution of}} legal title to land to poor urban dwellers, otherwise known as land titling. Given {{the billions of dollars}} that the World Bank, country-based development agencies, regional development banks, and developing countries themselves have spent on land <b>titling</b> <b>programs,</b> it {{has become one of the}} most important property law issues confronting the developing world. Several countries have undertaken comprehensive urban land <b>titling</b> <b>programs</b> to transform the dwellings of those who live in the squalor of squatter settlements into assets recognized by the formal sector.

The goal of urban <b>titling</b> <b>programs</b> should be to remove structural barriers that contribute to cycles of poverty by limiting indigent populations 2 ̆ 7 access to opportunity and their long-term ability to succeed. First, this Article reviews the literature regarding land titling to give a sense of how my contributions are situated within the larger academic discussion. Second, I develop a theory of how best to achieve titling mobility, which is a goal attained when the state allocates land title in a manner that eliminates structural barriers that impair poor people 2 ̆ 7 s social mobility and ability to accumulate wealth in the long-term. I argue that favorable location of titled land, and procedures that ensure equitable distribution of title among women and men, are essential. Third, I use the Peruvian, Philippine, and South African land <b>titling</b> <b>programs</b> as models to test my theory of how best to achieve titling mobility, by investigating how each government 2 ̆ 7 s method of allocating land titles affects poor populations. Fourth, I examine the distributional consequences of <b>titling</b> <b>programs</b> by focusing on who benefits from the resources expended and suggest how the Peruvian, Philippine, and South African models should be adjusted to comport with my theory of how best to achieve titling mobility...|$|R

40|$|<b>Title</b> I Schoolwide <b>Programs</b> and <b>Title</b> I Pullout <b>Programs</b> {{represent}} two <b>Title</b> I models {{designed to}} help children of low socioeconomic status improve reading comprehension. The {{purpose of this study}} was twofold: (1) to determine which Title I model was more effective using California Achievement Test Reading Comprehension Normal Curve Equivalent (NCE) scores as the measure of effectiveness and (2) to determine from structured administrative interviews how the results of this study might improve the <b>Title</b> I <b>program</b> choices of administrators. Eight school districts in rural Southeastern North Carolina were selected for this study. Six null hypotheses were formulated in order to study the effect upon reading comprehension student achievement of <b>Title</b> I Schoolwide <b>Programs</b> as compared to <b>Title</b> I Pullout <b>Programs</b> over a period of three years. Independent variables in the study were <b>Title</b> I Schoolwide <b>Programs</b> and <b>Title</b> I Pullout Programs; gender; ethnicity; and grade levels, 3 rd, 4 th and 5 th. The dependent variable in the study was reading comprehension as measured by the California Achievement Test. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures. Over three grade levels the findings indicated there were no significant differences between the two programs. However, findings indicated a significant difference between <b>Title</b> I Schoolwide <b>Programs</b> and <b>Title</b> I Pullout <b>Programs</b> California Achievement Test Reading Comprehension Normal Curve Equivalent scores during the first program year which was the third grade. The general finding favored <b>Title</b> I Schoolwide <b>Programs</b> over <b>Title</b> I Pullout <b>Programs.</b> The overall results suggested that <b>Title</b> I Schoolwide <b>Programs</b> had the same effect on the total student population that <b>Title</b> I Pullout <b>Programs</b> had on a limited number of eligible students within the student population. Because there were no significant differences in the two <b>Title</b> I <b>program</b> models, grade levels third, fourth, fifth, gender, and ethnicity, administrators believe this indicates program choice flexibility. The results from the structured administrative interviews also revealed the need to consider a variety of data resources in addition to reading comprehension subtests when making <b>Title</b> I <b>program</b> decisions. ...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature in different ways. It is the first investigation of the impacts of the Brazilian land-titling program on the adult labor supply. Such analysis can provide theoretical insights for <b>titling</b> <b>programs</b> and pro-poor spending in other developing and emerging economies. Secondly, the paper investigates whether the program had distributive impacts on the adult labor supply by estimating unconditional quantile treatment effects. To the best of our knowledge, potential distributional effects of a land-titling program on labor supply have never been studied. Finally, {{it is one of the}} few studies available in the empirical literature on land titles providing evidence of the impact of urban land <b>titling</b> <b>programs.</b>|$|R
30|$|As in {{the case}} of Galiani and Schargrodsky (2010), Field (2005) found that the greater {{incentives}} to invest were not associated with an improvement in credit access due to the <b>titling</b> <b>program,</b> but rather to a reduced threat of eviction. In particular, there was a significant increase in renovations financed out of pocket and in total investment among nonborrowing households.|$|E
30|$|The Brazilian federal {{government}} chose Osasco {{as one of}} the cities for the Papel Passado <b>titling</b> <b>program.</b> Osasco has 30, 000 people (about 6, 000 families) living under informal conditions, which represents almost 4.5 percent of its total population (ANOREG 2007). The program timetable for Osasco establishes that all the communities (or favelas) living in illegal conditions {{should be part of the}} Papel Passado during the 2007 to 2014 period.|$|E
30|$|This {{analysis}} offers various {{possibilities for}} further research. For example, {{the effects on}} the income and utility of households {{of the increase in}} the number of hours worked via the land <b>titling</b> <b>program</b> could be better investigated. At this stage, the income gain for households from increasing their labor force participation is not clear. Positive impact is found for use of credit, consumption of time saving durable goods and participation rate primarily in informal occupations.|$|E
30|$|Another {{plausible}} mechanism {{assumes that}} a land <b>title</b> <b>program</b> {{is followed by}} a better supply of public goods such as security, electricity, garbage collection, and provision of a sewage connection (in the Osasco’s case, immediately implementation of those public services were not part of the land <b>title</b> <b>program.</b> However, during several months after the titling, those services – each under a different timetable and dynamic – had started slowly {{to be part of the}} community’s routine). The supply of public goods would therefore have positive externalities, such as increasing the housing value of a neighborhood 2. In this scenario, a land <b>title</b> <b>program</b> could affect labor supply in two ways. Firstly, adults would have to work extra hours to pay their utility bills. Secondly, given the wealth effect that results from better access to public goods, the adult labor supply could increase or decrease, depending on whether leisure is a normal or inferior good 3. If adults consider leisure a normal good, the effect of the intervention on their labor supply will be ambiguous since they would have to work harder to pay the bills, but due to the wealth effect they could demand more leisure.|$|R
5000|$|Land titling {{is a form}} of {{land reform}} in which private {{individuals}} and families are given formal property rights for land which they have previously occupied informally or used on the basis of customary land tenure. Proponents argue that providing formal titles increases security of land tenure, supports development of markets in land, and allows better access to credit (using land titles as collateral). Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto Polar is the most well-known advocate of the approach, but it has a long history. Recently, [...] "inspired by these ideas, and fostered by international development agencies, land <b>titling</b> <b>programs</b> have been launched throughout developing and transition economies as part of poverty alleviation efforts." [...] The goals of poverty alleviation and urban management, however, can lead to conflicts in the design of land <b>titling</b> <b>programs.</b>|$|R
40|$|Land <b>titling</b> <b>programs</b> are {{increasingly}} encouraged by international organizations {{as an essential}} component of urban policy in developing countries. The clear definition of property rights is argued to be a sine qua non of economic development. However, most academic research on land titles has focused on the impacts of land titles and there is a dearth of analysis of the demand for land titling and the structure of land <b>titling</b> <b>programs.</b> A better understanding of land <b>titling</b> <b>programs</b> is essential for the policy to succeed in improving the lives of people living in informally developed neighborhoods. This paper presents a model of demand for land regularization in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. The model adapts previous work on land registration in agricultural areas to regularization in urban areas, incorporating insights on the different sources of value for urban land and titles in urban areas, as well as the characteristics of the regularization process in Mexico. An empirical test of the determinants of success in land titling is conducted using administrative and spatial data from 140 irregularly developed neighborhoods where regularization agencies are active. The prediction of previous modelsthat there should be more land titling for land that is valuabledoes not hold. The results demonstrate inefficiency in the land titling system of Tijuana, inefficiency that is possibly explained by governmental opportunism...|$|R
40|$|In this Article {{we explore}} the {{potential}} benefits and costs of a program to grant title to individuals who are occupying land informally. Only some of these benefits and costs have received careful empirical consideration in the literature. This Article references existing studies and draws on findings from original surveys of urban households in Ecuador. We consider how a <b>titling</b> <b>program</b> might affect the welfare of landowners and occupants, how it could alter the functioning of real estate markets, and whether it could build a community 2 ̆ 7 s social capital. Potential benefits must be weighed against a range of costs, including those accruing to the government for implementation of the program, {{as well as those}} perceived by individuals in their efforts to obtain title. There also may be dynamic implications of a <b>titling</b> <b>program.</b> For example, these programs can spur further land invasions and render the role of intermediaries more lucrative. The importance of formal property rights and of formal legal systems in governing transactions and land use is of particular interest given that property rights are frequently assigned the prominent role of a prerequisite to economic growth...|$|E

However, the authors could not rule out that this small effect was due to other unobservable characteristics affecting the creditworthiness of titled and untitled applicants.|$|E

30|$|Table  2 {{presents}} the estimation {{results of the}} empirical model for the baseline year 2007. In that year, Papel Passado {{had not yet been}} implemented and no household had received land title. The estimations, including (and excluding) the control variables, find no significant impact of land title on the number of hours worked weekly. As expected, the fact of whether or not a household belonged to the treated neighborhood before the program took place did not lead to a statistically significant difference in the number of hours worked. Prior to the program, the incentives to increase labor supply due to land title were weak, reducing the possibility of anticipation bias among the <b>titling</b> <b>program</b> participants.|$|E
30|$|The main {{implication}} of our empirical analysis {{is that the}} Brazilian land <b>titling</b> <b>program</b> had {{a positive effect on}} hours worked and labor supply among adults. While the ANCOVA and DD estimates point to the positive effects of land titling on the average number of weekly hours worked, the QTE method points to a distributive effect of the intervention, mainly at the median of the unconditional distribution of outcome variables. However, the estimates for the extensive margin of labor supply strongly suggest that the effect on hours worked is driven by the increase in participation rate since the coefficients for the ATT and QTE become small statistically insignificant once we condition the distribution on those already in the labor force at the baseline.|$|E

30|$|Another {{study of}} the effects of land titles using a {{quasi-experimental}} design is by Field (2005), who exploited the variation in ownership status induced by a nation-wide <b>titling</b> <b>program</b> in Peru in which 1.2 million property titles were distributed to urban squatters on public land between 1996 and 2003. Making use of differences across regions induced by the timing of the program and differences across target populations in the level of pre-program ownership rights, Field performed a difference-in-differences analysis comparing the change in housing investment before and after the program among participating households with the change among nonparticipants. Field constructed a panel using cross-sectional data with retrospective questions. The results indicate that strengthening property rights in urban slums had a significant effect on residential investment: the rate of housing renovation rose by {{more than two-thirds of the}} baseline level.|$|E
30|$|Most of the {{literature}} has focused on outcomes such as access to credit and investment (see Besley 1995, Field and Torero 2004; Carter and Pedro 2003; Galiani and Schargrodsky 2010; and Piza and Moura 2011), {{but only a few}} authors have turned their attention to second order effects, such as labor supply. As far as the authors of this paper are concerned, there is a limited sample of studies that apply experimental or quasi-experimental techniques to estimate the impact of land title on labor supply outcomes in urban areas of developing countries. Field (2007) looks at the impact of a massive land <b>titling</b> <b>program</b> in Peru on the labor supply (adult and child), whereas Moura and Bueno (2010) used quasi-experimental techniques to estimate the impact of a Brazilian land title program on the child labor supply.|$|E

Using a household survey from Indonesia, we provide evidence that formal land titles do have a positive and significant eect on access to credit and {{at least part of}} this effect is best interpreted as an improvement in ex-ante information ows. This result stands in contrast to the prevailing notion that land titles only function as collateral.
