Animal and vegetation associations from each type combine to create considerable diversity of habitat which is typical of either spruce or aspen stands.

25|$|Multiplying {{permutations}} {{written in}} cycle notation follows no easily described pattern, and {{the cycles of}} the product can be entirely {{different from those of}} the permutations being composed. However the cycle structure is preserved in the special case of conjugating a permutation σ by another permutation π, which means forming the product π·σ·π−1.

25|$|As Paul Erdős observed, the Sylvester–Gallai theorem {{immediately}} {{implies that}} any set of n points {{that are not}} collinear determines at least n different lines. As a base case, the result is clearly true for n=3. For any larger value of n, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> reduced from n points to n1 points, by deleting an ordinary line {{and one of the}} two points on it. Thus, it follows by mathematical induction. The example of a near-pencil (a set of n1 collinear points together with one additional point that is not on the same line as the other points) shows that this bound is tight.|$|E

Combined, the books present a portrait of loss, heroism, survival, and perseverance {{through the eyes of}} victims, witnesses, rescuers, refugees, reporters, civil authorities, soldiers and criminals. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> read as more than a record of one period in a particular nation’s history, but a universal story of sacrifice, heartbreak, faith, redemption and transcendence during crisis.|$|E
25|$|Fertile feeding {{grounds for}} forage fish are {{provided}} by ocean upwellings. Oceanic gyres are large-scale ocean currents caused by the Coriolis effect. Wind-driven surface currents interact with these gyres and the underwater topography, such as seamounts and the edge of continental shelves, to produce downwellings and upwellings. These can transport nutrients which plankton thrive on. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> rich feeding grounds attractive to the plankton feeding forage fish. In turn, the forage fish themselves become a feeding ground for larger predator fish. Most upwellings are coastal, {{and many of them}} support some of the most productive fisheries in the world. Regions of notable upwelling include coastal Peru, Chile, Arabian Sea, western South Africa, eastern New Zealand and the California coast.|$|E
25|$|Essentially, as a result, when light propagates {{through the}} {{cleavage}} plane and transits to free space {{from within the}} semiconductor crystal, {{a fraction of the}} light energy is absorbed by the surface states where it is converted to heat by phonon-electron interactions. This heats the cleaved mirror. In addition, the mirror may heat simply because the edge of the diode laser—which is electrically pumped—is in less-than-perfect contact with the mount that provides a path for heat removal. The heating of the mirror causes the bandgap of the semiconductor to shrink in the warmer areas. The bandgap shrinkage brings more electronic band-to-band transitions into alignment with the photon energy causing yet more absorption. This is thermal runaway, a form of positive feedback, and <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> melting of the facet, known as catastrophic optical damage, or COD.|$|E

25|$|Checksum – Each note has {{a unique}} serial number. The {{remainder}} from dividing the serial number by 9 gives checksum corresponding to the initial letter indicated on the note. Using {{a variation of the}} divisibility rule shortcut, the remainder from division by 9 can easily be found by adding the constituent digits and, if the sum still does not make the remainder obvious, adding the digits of the sum. Alternatively, substituting the letter with its ASCII value makes the resulting number exactly divisible by 9. Taking the same example, Z10708476264, the ASCII code for Z is 90, so the resulting number is 9010708476264. Dividing by 9 yields a remainder of 0. Using the divisibility rule again, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> checked speedily since the addition of all digits gives 54; 5 + 4 = 9—so the number is divisible by 9, or 9010708476264 modulo 9 is 0.|$|E
25|$|This {{construction}} differs {{slightly from}} the one in (Macdonald, 1979). That construction only uses the surjective morphisms n without mentioning the injective morphisms n: it constructs the homogeneous components of R separately, and equips their direct sum with a ring structure using the n. It is also observed that <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> described as an inverse limit {{in the category of}} graded rings. That description however somewhat obscures an important property typical for a direct limit of injective morphisms, namely that every individual element (symmetric function) is already faithfully represented in some object used in the limit construction, here a ring RSd. It suffices to take for d the degree of the symmetric function, since the part in degree d of that ring is mapped isomorphically to rings with more indeterminates by n for all n'd. This implies that for studying relations between individual elements, there is no fundamental difference between symmetric polynomials and symmetric functions.|$|E
25|$|The Current Population Survey (aka Household Survey) {{measures}} {{the percentage of}} the population that is employed and unemployed. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> multiplied by population estimates to get total employment estimates. This survey has the advantage over the payroll survey in that it includes self-employed. The Household Survey is less accurate in producing total numbers since it requires population estimates and in that it samples many fewer people (60,000 households versus 400,000 business establishments). For better or worse, the Household Survey counts multiple jobs held by one person only once, and it includes government workers, farm workers, unpaid family workers, and workers absent without pay. The Household Survey indicates that {{the percentage of the}} population employed decreased from 64.4% in December 2000 and January 2001 to 62.1% in August and September 2003. By August 2005, it had recovered only to 62.9%. In absolute numbers, this corresponds to a drop of 1.6 million jobs but an eventual net gain of 4.7 million jobs during the Bush administration.|$|E

However {{the times of}} sessions and intervals may be altered in certain circumstances: if bad weather or a change of innings occurs close to a scheduled break, the break may be taken immediately; {{if there has been}} a loss of playing time, for example because of bad weather, the session times may be adjusted to make up the lost time; if the batting side is nine wickets down at the scheduled tea break, then the interval may be delayed until either 30 minutes has elapsed or the team is all out; the final session may be extended by up to 30 minutes if 90 or more overs have not been bowled in that day's play (subject to any reduction for adverse weather); the final session may be extended by 30 minutes (except on the 5th day) if the umpires believe <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> decided within that time.|$|E
25|$|The vanilloid {{receptor}} (VR-1, TRPV1) is a receptor that {{is found}} on the free nerve endings of both C and Aδ fibers that responds to elevated levels of heat (>43nbsp&°C) and the chemical capsaicin. Capsaicin activates C fibers by opening a ligand-gated ion channel and causing an action potential to occur. Because this receptor responds to both capsaicin and heat, chili peppers are sensed as hot. VR-1 is also {{able to respond to}} extracellular acidification and can integrate simultaneous exposure to all three sensory stimuli. VR1 is essential for the inflammatory sensitization to noxious thermal stimuli. A second type of receptor, a vanilloid-like receptor (TRPV2,VRL-1), has a higher threshold of activation regarding heat of about 52nbsp&°C and also responds to capsaicin and low pH. Both types of receptors are transmembrane receptors that are closed during resting conditions. When open, these receptors allow for an influx of sodium and calcium which initiates an action potential across the fibers. Both receptors are part of a larger family of receptors called transient receptor potential (TRP) receptors. If damage to these heat transducer receptors occurs, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> chronic neuropathic pain caused by lowering the heat pain threshold for their phosphorylation.|$|E
