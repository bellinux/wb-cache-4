25|$|Brigade Captain (Yellow helmet {{with a red}} stripe) is {{the most}} senior rank in a brigade {{and he or she}} is {{responsible}} for the operational and administrative aspects of the brigade. The position is elected by members of the brigade. Some of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Captain will do are: undertaking responsibility for the proper management and maintenance of brigade property and equipment, ensuring members of the brigade are properly trained, take command of incidents and ensure that the chain of command within the brigade operates effectively, assisting with bushfire prevention and planning within the brigade's response area, liaising with other captains in adjacent brigades and managing the operations of the brigade in accordance with any determination of the CFS board.|$|E

"One of {{the most}} {{important}} things we were looking for in casting was the actors' ability to play the subtleties – the little <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> character doesn't say or do that create the edge, the things that get under your skin and spook you," [...] Morgan said about the auditions.|$|E
500|$|Municipal {{governments are}} created by the Government of Yukon in {{accordance}} with the Municipal Act of 2001. Municipal governments provide [...] "jurisdiction services, facilities, or <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> local government considers necessary or desirable for all or part of its community". Classifications of municipalities under the Municipal Act include cities and towns. Whitehorse is the capital of Yukon and its only city. The remaining seven municipalities are towns, of which four were villages that were continued as towns upon adoption of the 2001 Municipal Act.|$|E
500|$|Steven Spielberg, {{a fan of}} {{the comics}} and toys, signed on as {{executive}} producer in 2004. John Rogers wrote the first draft, which pitted four Autobots against four Decepticons, and featured the Ark spaceship. Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, fans of the cartoon, were hired to rewrite the script in February 2005. Spielberg suggested that [...] "a boy and his car" [...] should be the focus. This appealed to Orci and Kurtzman because it conveyed themes of adulthood and responsibility, [...] "the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> car represents in the United States". The characters of Sam and Mikaela were the sole point of view given in Orci and Kurtzman's first draft. The Transformers had no dialogue, as the producers feared talking robots would look ridiculous. The writers felt that even if it would look silly, not having the robots speak would betray the fanbase. The first draft also had a battle scene in the Grand Canyon. Spielberg read each of Orci and Kurtzman's drafts and gave notes for improvement. The writers remained involved throughout production, adding additional dialogue for the robots during the sound mixing (although none of this was kept in the final film, which ran fifteen minutes shorter than the initial edit). Furman's The Ultimate Guide, published by Dorling Kindersley, remained as a resource to the writers throughout production. Prime Directive was used as a fake working title. This was also the name of Dreamwave Productions' first [...]|$|E

2500|$|To {{ensure that}} the person has lupus and not another {{autoimmune}} disease, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) established a list of clinical and immunologic criteria that, in any combination, point to SLE. [...] The criteria include symptoms that the person can identify (e.g. pain) and <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> physician can detect in a physical examination and through laboratory test results. [...] The list was originally compiled in 1971, initially revised in 1982, and further revised and improved in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|By way of distinction, {{the organs}} {{of the company}} were {{expressed}} to have various corporate powers. [...] If the objects were {{the things that the}} company was able to do, then the powers were the means by which it could do them. [...] Usually expressions of powers were limited to methods of raising capital, although from earlier times distinctions between objects and powers have caused lawyers difficulty. Most jurisdictions have now modified the position by statute, and companies generally have capacity to do all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> natural person could do, and power to do it in any way that a natural person could do it.|$|E
2500|$|Another of {{his network}} {{assignments}} was The Morning Show, CBS' short-lived challenge to NBC's Today in 1954. His on-air duties included interviewing guests and chatting with a lion puppet named Charlemane about the news. He considered this discourse with a puppet as [...] "one of the highlights" [...] of the show. He added, [...] "A puppet can render opinions on people and <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> human commentator would not {{feel free to}} utter. I was and I am proud of it." [...] Cronkite also angered the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the show's sponsor, by grammatically correcting its advertising slogan. Instead of saying [...] "Winston tastes good like a cigarette should" [...] verbatim, he substituted [...] "as" [...] for [...] "like." ...|$|E

2500|$|For a {{few years}} {{starting}} 1990, the World Bank anchored absolute poverty line as $1 per day. This was revised in 1993, and through 2005, absolute poverty was $1.08 a day for all countries on a purchasing power parity basis, after adjusting for inflation to the 1993 U.S. dollar. In 2005, after extensive studies of cost of living across the world, The World Bank raised the measure for global poverty line to reflect the observed higher cost of living. In 2015, the World Bank defines extreme poverty as living on less than US$1.90 (PPP) per day, and moderate poverty as less than $2 or $5 a day (but note that a person or family with access to subsistence resources, e.g., subsistence farmers, may have a low cash income without a correspondingly low standard of living – they are not living [...] "on" [...] their cash income but {{using it as a}} top up). It estimated that [...] "in 2001, 1.1 billion people had consumption levels below $1 a day and 2.7 billion lived on less than $2 a day." [...] A 'dollar a day', in nations that do not use the U.S. dollar as currency, does not translate to living a day on the equivalent amount of local currency as determined by the exchange rate. Rather, it is determined by the purchasing power parity rate, which would look at how much local currency is needed to buy the same <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> dollar could buy in the United States. Usually, this would translate to less local currency than the exchange rate in poorer countries as the United States is a relatively more expensive country.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{significant}} thematic and stylistic differences exist between the 1549 story and the 1909 Romanian version, which is almost four times as large as Machiavelli's; as noted early on by scholar Mihail Dragomirescu, Caragiale's text grew as a [...] "symbolic novel". Describing Kir Ianulea and the various other portions of Schițe noi as early samples of metafiction, Cap-Bun noted: [...] "the new filters were so efficient that one can hardly recognize the new grains growing from the sedimentary beds of the source culture to be responses to the primary texts." [...] Machiavelli's original mixes characters in Ancient Greek myths (the presence of Pluto, Minos and Rhadamanthus) with Jewish and Christian mythology (the heresy of Peor), making Belphegor's mission relate to the supposed evils of womanhood and the morals of medieval Florence. In contrast to Belphegor, Caragiale's protagonist is feeble, shy, and, Șerban Cioculescu argues, a [...] "sympathetic" [...] figure. These differences were still deemed insufficient by Călinescu and by his contemporary, the influential modernist reviewer Eugen Lovinescu. The former judged Kir Ianulea a [...] "larger version" [...] of Machiavelli's account, while Lovinescu saw {{it as one of}} the pieces where Caragiale [...] "brought only his storyteller's art, and nothing from his invention". Giovanni Rotiroti, an Italian critic and psychoanalyst, argues: [...] "The Romanian novella does not move very far away from Machiavelli's, except in matters of lexical richness, as well as in scale and number of pages." [...] Evidencing the thematic relationship and the tripartite structure of both stories, Rotiroti concludes: [...] "The parallelism between the two novellas is perfect". He believes that Caragiale imagined a partial translation from Machiavelli, discarding those fragments he identified as weak, and turning the Florentine peculiarities into <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> modern Romanian audience could find alluring. Tatiana-Ana Fluieraru also proposes that Caragiale's story, unlike his other late pieces which reuse older themes, is an [...] "actual reconstruction" [...] of the source.|$|E
