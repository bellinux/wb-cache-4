25|$|While defeated, however, {{these states}} were not destroyed; if Hammurabi {{had a plan}} for welding them to Babylon he did not live long enough <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>through.</b> Within {{a few years of}} his death, Elam and Assyria had {{withdrawn}} from Babylon's orbit and revolutions had started in all the conquered territories. The task of dealing with these troubles—and others—fell to Samsu-iluna. Though he campaigned tirelessly and seems to have won frequently, the king proved unable to stop the empire's unwinding. Through it all, however, he did manage to keep the core of his kingdom intact, and this allowed the city of Babylon to cement its position in history.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Dad's Army, Graham McCann {{explains}} that the show owes much to Michael Mills. It was he who renamed the show Dad's Army. He did not like Brightsea-on-Sea, so the location was changed to Walmington-on-Sea. He was happy with the names for the characters Mainwaring, Godfrey and Pike but not with other names, and he made suggestions: Private Jim Duck became Frazer, Joe Fish became Joe Walker and Jim Jones became Jack Jones. He also suggested adding a Scot. Jimmy Perry had produced the original idea but needed an experienced man <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>through.</b> Mills suggested David Croft, and so their partnership began.|$|E
25|$|In 1853, Konstantin's father Tsar Nicholas I {{made him}} General-Admiral of the Imperial Navy {{and head of}} the Department of the Imperial navy. In this position, {{he was in charge of}} {{reforming}} a navy that had largely remained unchanged since the time of Peter the Great. It fell upon Konstantin to not only preside over an archaic fleet but also <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>through</b> the disaster of the Crimean War. In the midst of the conflict, his father died and Konstantin advised his brother to search for peace in a war already lost. In early 1856, he accompanied his brother Alexander II to the Crimea to view first-hand the devastation of the War. These early military experiences gave Konstantin a loathing of army life and the futility of war. From then on, he was a man of peace, despite his keen interest in the navy, and in political terms a progressive. There was a close working relationship between the two brothers, which was responsible for many reforms. Konstantin was also sent on a diplomatic mission to Napoleon III.|$|E

500|$|In early 1938, {{when her}} widower Simon Boyanus {{brought up the}} {{possibility}} of publishing Armstrong's Kikuyu manuscript, Daniel Jones arranged for Beatrice Honikman <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>through</b> to publication. Jones was reportedly [...] "deeply affected" [...] by Armstrong's death; he wrote Armstrong's obituary for , and his preface to The Phonetic Structure of Kikuyu paid homage to her life. When the University College phonetics library had to be restocked after being bombed in World War II during the London Blitz, Jones donated a copy of Armstrong's posthumously published book [...] "as a fitting start in {{the reconstruction of the}} Phonetics Departmental Library".|$|E
500|$|In early 1843, having {{completed}} the Webster–Ashburton treaty and other diplomatic efforts, Tyler felt ready to pursue Texas. Now lacking a party base, he saw annexation {{of the republic}} as his only pathway to independent re-election in 1844. For {{the first time in}} his career he was willing to play [...] "political hardball" [...] <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>through.</b> As a trial balloon he dispatched his ally Thomas Walker Gilmer, then a U.S. Representative from Virginia, to publish a letter defending annexation, which was well received. Despite his successful relationship with Webster, Tyler knew he would need a Secretary of State who supported the Texas initiative. With the work on the British treaty now completed, he forced Webster's resignation and installed Hugh S. Legaré of South Carolina as an interim successor.|$|E

500|$|In Primus' early {{teenage years}} {{he played for}} his local Sunday league {{football}} club, Pretoria, based in Canning Town after being introduced by a school friend. Charlton Athletic arranged a friendly match with Pretoria and Primus was offered the chance to join the Charlton associate schoolboys which he took. For {{the last two years}} of his school life, Primus traveled to Greenwich twice a week to train with the team; in addition to this he played matches on a Sunday against the schoolboy teams of clubs such as Maidstone United and Dover Athletic. Primus initially struggled to cope; he cited the [...] "dog eat dog" [...] nature and the [...] "ambitious and aggressive" [...] parents as factors but nevertheless he decided <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>through</b> later remarking that it was a [...] "very strong character building experience".|$|E
500|$|On August 4, 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt {{visited the}} {{construction}} site and {{was impressed by the}} project and its purpose. He gave a speech to workers and spectators, closing with this statement: [...] "I leave here today with the feeling that this work is well undertaken; that we are going ahead with a useful project, and we are going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>through</b> for the benefit of our country." [...] Soon after his visit, Reclamation was allowed to proceed with the high dam plan but faced the problems of transitioning the design and negotiating an altered contract with MWAK. In , for an additional , MWAK and Six Companies, Inc. agreed to join together as Consolidated Builders Inc. and construct the high dam. Six Companies had just finished the Hoover Dam and was nearing completion of Parker Dam. The new design, chosen and approved by the Reclamation office in Denver, included several improvements, one of which was the irrigation pumping plant.|$|E

50|$|Before the Partition of India {{internal}} migration was commonplace between the region {{which is now}} Bangladesh and the regions of Assam and West Bengal.

50|$|Besides {{requiring}} less payload, {{the ability}} to use a lunar lander designed just for that purpose was another advantage of the LOR approach. The LEM's design gave the astronauts a clear view of their landing site through observation windows approximately 15 ft above the surface, as opposed to being on their backs in a Command Module lander, at least 40 or 50 ft above the surface, able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> only <b>through</b> a television screen.|$|R

2500|$|I publish these poems, few {{though they}} are, {{because it is}} not likely that I shall ever be impelled to write much more.

2500|$|There {{were only}} two copies of the {{subscription}} list. Despite assurances from The Ladder to subscribers that these names would be kept confidential, Rita LaPorte took the list of 3,800 names from DOB headquarters and the printers without telling anyone but Grier. When Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon discovered its loss, they assumed the police or FBI had confiscated it. Previous editors Martin, Lyon, Gittings, and Sandoz considered the act a theft. Because LaPorte took the list over state lines, pursuing {{it would have been}} a federal matter, and the Daughters did not have the resources <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>through.</b> Grier severed ties with DOB leadership and in doing so took away the Daughters' primary method of communication from the national organization to its individual chapters. As a national organization, the Daughters of Bilitis folded in 1970, although some local chapters still continue. Grier also effectively ended The Ladder, despite her plans for the magazine to run on advertising (something The Ladder had not previously had) and subscriptions, when the $3,000 checks from [...] "Pennsylvania", written to the DOB, stopped coming. By 1972, The Ladder had run out of funds and it folded.|$|E

60|$|So Kaliko {{went to a}} tube in {{the wall}} of rock and put his eye to it.

60|$|For {{a moment}} longer Martin-Roget hesitated: he abominated this {{suggestion}} of becoming a mere instrument {{in the hands of}} this man whom he still would have affected to despise--had he dared. But here came the difficulty: he no longer dared to despise Chauvelin. He felt the strength of the man--the clearness of his intellect, and though he--Martin-Roget--still chose to disregard every warning in connexion with the English spies, he could not wholly divest his mind from the possibility of their presence in Nantes. Carrier's scheme was so magnificent, so satisfying, that the ex-miller's son was ready to humble his pride and set his arrogance aside in order <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> carried <b>through</b> successfully.|$|R

That her eyes were remarkably expressive is confirmed in the several portraits of Anne by Thomas Gainsborough.|$|R
