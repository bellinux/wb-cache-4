40|$|We analyse the {{conditions}} under which an (<b>S,s)</b> <b>rule</b> may be derived and compare these with alternative rules. We consider the case of labour demand with fixed adjustment costs. The (<b>S,s)</b> <b>rule</b> implies a specific ordering of choices: downward adjustment, non-adjustment and upward adjustment with the decision of inaction lying crucially in the middle. We may model firms' decisions as an (<b>S,s)</b> <b>rule</b> only if it is possible to characterise unobserved heterogeneity as an exact negative relation between the choice-specific error terms. Assuming that these are normally distributed, the particular ordering of choices implied by the (<b>S,s)</b> <b>rule</b> may be estimated by an ordered probit. We test the (<b>S,s)</b> <b>rule</b> nesting the ordered probit within a multinomial model with correlated error terms. We find that restriction of univariate error distribution is rejected by the data...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Repeating a QC that {{is outside}} 2 SD from the mean (1 : 2 <b>s</b> <b>rule)</b> {{appears to be}} a common practice. Although this formof repeat {{sampling}} is frowned onby many, the comparative power of the approach has not been formally evaluated. METHODS: We computed power functions mathemati-cally and by computer simulation for 4 different 1 : 2 s repeat-sampling strategies, as well as the 1 : 2 <b>s</b> <b>rule,</b> the 1 : 3 <b>s</b> <b>rule,</b> and 2 common QC multirules. RESULTS: The false-rejection rates for the repeat-sampling strategies were similarly low to those of the 1 : 3 <b>s</b> QC <b>rule.</b> The error detection rates for the repeat-sampling strategies approached those of the 1 : 2 <b>s</b> QC <b>rule</b> for moderate to large out-of-control error condi-tions.

40|$|This paper tests {{an optimal}} (<b>S,</b> <b>s)</b> <b>rule</b> in {{household}} durable purchases and examines directly the resulting aggregate expenditure dynamics. The observed decision rule responds to income uncertainty and growth as predicted by an (S, s) model resulting from transactions costs. Tests against liquidity constraints find {{that about half}} the households purchase according to an optimal (<b>S,</b> <b>s)</b> <b>rule.</b> Aggregating the (<b>S,</b> <b>s)</b> <b>rule</b> over households produces a cross-section distribution of durables holdings. The empirical distribution {{is similar to that}} predicted theoretically, as is its response to aggregate shocks. Furthermore, simulations of aggregate expenditure based on the household distribution exhibit dynamics consistent with those observed in the 1980 s.
