It has the same structure as the E190, but with an extended range of up to 4,200nmi, and luxury seating for up to 19. It was certified by the USA Federal Aviation Administration on 7 January 2009. The first two production aircraft were delivered in December 2008.|$|E

In addition to the 15kV/16.7Hz and 25kV/50Hz AC supplies, the new model could also be operated under 3kV DC overhead electrification. Later models also supported a 1.5kV DC supply. This locomotive for SBB was also the first TRAXX variant with individual axle control in place of individual bogie control. The general <b>type</b> <b>name</b> given by Bombardier was TRAXX F140 MS.|$|E

25|$|Optional {{types are}} created with the Optional mechanism—to make an Integer that is nullable, one {{would use a}} {{declaration}} similar to var optionalInteger: Optional. As in C#, Swift also includes syntactic sugar for this, allowing one to indicate a variable is optional by placing a question mark after the <b>type</b> <b>name,</b> var optionalInteger: Int?. Variables or constants that are marked optional either have a value of the underlying type or are nil. Optional types wrap the base type, resulting in a different instance. String and String? are fundamentally different types, the latter has {{more in common with}} Int? than String.|$|E
25|$|The Domain Name System {{specifies}} a set {{of various}} types of resource records (RRs), which are the basic information elements of the domain name system. Each record has a <b>type</b> (<b>name</b> and number), an expiration time (time to live), a class, and type-specific data. Resource records of the same type are described as a resource record set (RRset). The order of resource records in a set, which is returned by a resolver to an application, is undefined, but often servers implement round-robin ordering to achieve load balancing. The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), however, work on the complete set of resource record in canonical order.|$|E
25|$|During the Hellenistic period, {{the light}} trireme was supplanted by larger {{warships}} in dominant navies, especially the pentere/quinquereme. The maximum practical number of oar banks a ship could have was three. So {{the number in}} the <b>type</b> <b>name</b> did not refer to the banks of oars any more (as for biremes and triremes), but {{to the number of}} rowers per vertical section, with several men on each oar. The reason for this development was the increasing use of armour on the bows of warships against ramming attacks, which again required heavier ships for a successful attack. This increased the number of rowers per ship, and also made it possible to use less well-trained personnel for moving these new ships. This change was accompanied by an increased reliance on tactics like boarding, missile skirmishes and using warships as platforms for artillery.|$|E

500|$|The above line of code {{tells the}} {{compiler}} to use System {{as a candidate}} prefix for types used in the source code. In this case, when the compiler sees use of the Console type later in the source code, it tries to find a <b>type</b> <b>named</b> Console, first in the current assembly, followed by all referenced assemblies. In this case the compiler fails to find such a <b>type,</b> since the <b>name</b> of the <b>type</b> is actually System.Console. The compiler then attempts to find a <b>type</b> <b>named</b> System.Console by using the System prefix from the [...] statement, {{and this time it}} succeeds. The [...] statement allows the programmer to state all candidate prefixes to use during compilation instead of always using full <b>type</b> <b>names.</b>|$|R

PHP7.0 also has type declarations for function return types, expressed by placing the <b>type</b> <b>name</b> after the list of parameters, preceded by a colon. For example, the getAdder function from the earlier example could be annotated with types like so in PHP7: ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] was a {{class of}} tanker/transport {{submarines}} built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during World War II. The IJN called this type of submarine [...] The <b>type</b> <b>name,</b> was shortened to [...] The IJN designed these submarines to support flying boats in forward areas. By the time the first submarine was finished, this capability was no longer needed and she was converted into an oil tanker. That boat, I-351, was sunk on the return leg of her second voyage in 1945; the second boat was destroyed by an American air raid before she was completed. Four additional submarines were planned, but were cancelled before they were laid down.|$|E
500|$|The maximum {{practical}} {{number of}} oar ranks a ship could have logistically was three (Greek and Latin tri-). [...] Beyond three, {{the number in}} the <b>type</b> <b>name</b> did not refer {{to the number of}} ranks of oars any more (as for biremes and triremes, respectively two and three ranks of oars with one rower per oar), but to the number of rowers per vertical section, with several men on each oar. [...] Indeed, just because a ship was designated with a larger type number did not mean it necessarily had or operated all three possible ranks: the quadrireme may have been a simple evolution of a standard trireme, but with two rowers on the top oar; it may also have been a bireme with two men on each oar; or it may just have had a single rank with four men on a each single oar. [...] Classes of ship could differ in their configuration between regions and over time, but in no case did a [...] "four" [...] ship have four horizontal ranks of oars.|$|E

2500|$|The {{number of}} sources for more precise dating and the {{attribution}} of provenience increase during the 17th century. Safavid carpets were presented as diplomatic gifts to European cities and states, as diplomatic relations intensified. In 1603, Shah Abbas presented a carpet with inwoven gold and silver threads to the Venetian doge Marino Grimani. European noblemen began ordering carpets directly from the manufactures of Isfahan and Kashan, whose weavers were willing to weave specific designs, like European coats of arms, into the commissioned peces. Their acquisition was sometimes meticulously documented: In 1601, the Armenian Sefer Muratowicz was sent to Kashan by the Polish king Sigismund III Vasa in order to commission 8 carpets with the Polish royal court of arms to be inwoven. The Kashan weavers did so, and on 12 September 1602 Muratowicz presented the carpets to the Polish king, and the bill to the treasurer of the crown. Representative Safavid carpets made of silk with inwoven gold and silver threads were erroneously believed by Western art historians to be of Polish manufacture. Although the error was corrected, carpets of this type retained the name of [...] "Polish" [...] or [...] "Polonaise" [...] carpets. The more appropriate <b>type</b> <b>name</b> of [...] "Shah Abbas" [...] carpets was suggested by Kurt Erdmann.|$|E
