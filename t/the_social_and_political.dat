5|$|In {{her later}} works, such as A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), Wollstonecraft {{repeatedly}} {{returns to the}} topics addressed in Thoughts, particularly the virtue {{of hard work and}} the imperative for women to learn useful skills. Wollstonecraft suggests that <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> life of the nation would greatly improve if women were to acquire valuable skills instead of being mere social ornaments.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the Portuguese {{presence}} on the Angolan coast remained limited {{for much of the}} colonial period. The degree of real colonial settlement was minor, and, with few exceptions, the Portuguese did not interfere by means other than commercial in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> dynamics of the native peoples. There was no real delimitation of territory; Angola, to all intents and purposes, did not yet exist.|$|E
40|$|The current {{research}} aimed to assess <b>the</b> <b>social,</b> national <b>and</b> <b>political</b> identities {{of members of}} the Irish and Northern Irish diaspora in England. Drawing upon research on social identity theory (SIT), it was hypothesised that there would be significant differences between <b>the</b> <b>social,</b> national <b>and</b> <b>political</b> identities {{of members of the}} Irish and Northern Irish diaspora and also that there would be significant differences between <b>the</b> <b>social,</b> national <b>and</b> <b>political</b> identities of members of the Catholic and Protestant Northern Irish diaspora. Two hundred and fifty-one members of the Irish and Northern Irish diaspora in England rated themselves on a number of ethnic identity items. It was determined that there are significant differences between <b>the</b> <b>social,</b> national <b>and</b> <b>political</b> identities of the Irish and Northern Irish diasporic groups and that there are significant differences between <b>the</b> <b>social,</b> national <b>and</b> <b>political</b> identities of the Northern Irish Catholic and Protestant diasporic groups. Results are discussed with reference to SIT, the development and maintenance of diasporic identities and the conflict in Northern Ireland...|$|R

5|$|While the Crusades had causes {{deeply rooted}} in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> {{situations}} of 11th-century Europe, the event actually triggering the First Crusade was a request for assistance from Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Alexios {{was worried about the}} advances of the Seljuqs, who had reached as far west as Nicaea, not far from Constantinople. In March 1095, Alexios sent envoys to the Council of Piacenza to ask Pope Urban II for aid against the Turks.|$|E

5|$|Food and cuisine in Ireland {{takes its}} {{influence}} from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate and from <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until {{the arrival of}} the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing. Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.|$|E
5|$|Stratton wrote Social Psychology for International Conduct {{for social}} science {{teachers}} {{who wanted to}} use psychology to analyze international affairs. The book's first part evaluated races. Stratton concluded the Caucasoid and Mongoloid races were innately more intelligent enabling them to build strong cultures. He also stated the prejudice of other people was from <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> advantages it brought. Stratton saw nations as made up of individuals and possessing a national character similar to what individuals had. Reviewing the book in the American Journal of Sociology, Ellsworth Faris objected to the author concluding the Northern and Central Europeans were more intelligent than Southern and Eastern Europeans, noting intelligence measures correlated also with length of stay in America.|$|E
5|$|Trimmer's {{works are}} {{dedicated}} to maintaining many aspects of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> status quo. As a high church Anglican, she was intent on promoting the established Church of England and on teaching young children and the poor the doctrines of Christianity. Her writings outlined the benefits of social hierarchy, arguing that each class should remain in its God-given position. Yet, while supporting many of the traditional political and social ideologies of her time, Trimmer questioned others, such as those surrounding gender and the family.|$|E

5|$|Between {{these two}} systems, {{that of the}} {{political}} order predominates in the layout of Ambohimanga, and the sacredness {{of the city was}} historically more explicitly associated with its role as a political rather than an astrological center. The forbidding of foreigners from the site in the 19th century, for instance, was enacted to preserve the sanctity of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> order, rather than the religious order. By respecting these systems of symbolism, successive rulers sought to ensure the benediction of the ancestors, strengthen the legitimacy of their rule and ensure the protection and stability of their kingdom. However, adherence to cardinal division and symbolism of space is weaker at Ambohimanga than its embodiment of the significance of vertical space and elevation as an indicator of rank. The site of each new compound within the royal city was selected less for its cardinal direction than for {{the extent to which it}} was located on higher ground than the compound that predated it.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Australians {{were far}} more circumspect. The nation's {{involvement}} cost more than 60,000 Australian lives and many more were left unable to work {{as a result of their}} injuries. The impact of the war was felt in many other areas as well. Financially it was very costly, while the effect on <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> landscape was considerable and threatened to cause serious divides in the nation's social fabric. Conscription was possibly the most contentious issue and ultimately, despite having conscription for home service, Australia was one of only two combatants not to use conscripts in the fighting. Nevertheless, for many Australians the nation's involvement in World War I and the Gallipoli campaign was seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of the Australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war and Anzac Day is commemorated as a national holiday.|$|E

5|$|Duhalde was {{succeeded by}} Néstor Kirchner on May 25, 2003. Kirchner soon {{distanced himself from}} Duhalde, and removed all the people close to Duhalde from the {{government}} to reduce his political influence. Kirchner also sought supporters from all <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> spectra to counter the influence of Duhalde within the party. However, both men delayed an open dispute and stuck together during the 2003 legislative elections, held in October. The dispute continued in the 2005 midterm elections. Without consensus in the PJ for a single candidate for senator of the Buenos Aires province, both leaders had their respective wives run for the office: Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ, and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for the Front for Victory, which was kept by the Kirchners. Cristina Kirchner won those elections.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, soul music was {{influenced}} by psychedelic rock and other styles. <b>The</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> ferment of the times inspired artists like Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield to release album-length statements with hard-hitting social commentary. Artists like James Brown led soul towards more dance-oriented music, which eventually evolved into funk. Funk was typified by 1970s bands like Parliament-Funkadelic, The Meters, and James Brown himself, while more versatile groups like War, The Commodores and Earth, Wind and Fire also became popular. During the 1970s, some highly slick and commercial blue-eyed soul acts like Philadelphia's Hall & Oates achieved mainstream success, {{as well as a}} new generation of street-corner harmony or city-soul groups like The Delfonics and Howard University's Unifics.|$|E
5|$|Indeed, {{this period}} in Greek history is {{remarkable}} for <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> upheaval in many Greek cities, particularly {{the establishment of}} the first democracy in Athens. The island of Naxos, part of the Cyclades group in the Aegean Sea, was also in this period affected by political turmoil. Naxos had been ruled by the tyrant Lygdamis, a protege of the Athenian tyrant Peisistratos, until around 524 BC, when he was overthrown by the Spartans. After this, a native aristocracy seems to have flourished, and Naxos {{became one of the most}} prosperous and powerful of the Aegean islands. Despite its success, Naxos was not immune to class tensions and internal strife, and shortly before 500 BC, the population seized power, expelling the aristocrats and establishing a democracy.|$|E

5|$|The {{backlash}} against the socialist Second Republic brought about the democratic Third Republic under consecutive presidents Albert Zafy (1991), Ratsiraka (1997) and Marc Ravalomanana (2001), followed by a Fourth Republic under Andry Rajoelina, who {{came to power in}} a 2009 coup d'état. Although Dama performed at political rallies in Paris during the eight-month political standoff following the 2001 presidential elections that brought Ravalomanana to power, Mahaleo as a full group has never sided with any particular politician, instead expressing through their lyrics <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> views and concerns of the average Malagasy citizen. They tend to promote collective, grassroots action as the best solution to the country's problems, rather than entrusting the work to politicians and international development partners.|$|E
5|$|The tax was {{rescinded}} by the British in 1812, {{who then}} imposed a British style constitution on the island. One legal innovation {{of this time}} of particular consequence for the aristocracy was that creditors, who had previously only been able to enforce repayments of the interest on a loan or mortgage, could now seize property. Property began to change hands in smaller parcels at auctions, and consequently a land-owning bourgeoisie immediately began to flourish. Revolts against the Bourbons in 1821, and 1848 divided the nobility, and liberalism was in the air. These factors coupled with <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> upheaval of the following Risorgimento in the 19th century meant the Sicilian aristocracy was a doomed class. Furthermore, because of their neglect and dereliction of noblesse oblige, {{an essential element of}} the feudal system, the countryside was often ruled by bandits outside the enclosed villages, and the once grand country villas were decaying. The building mania of the Sicilian upper class was over.|$|E
5|$|This pricing {{mechanism}} {{has been}} used in several public utilities and public services for setting higher prices during congested periods, as a means to better manage the demand for the service, and whether to avoid expensive new investments just to satisfy peak demand, or because it is not economically or financially feasible to provide additional capacity to the service. Congestion pricing has been widely used by telephone and electric utilities, metros, railways and autobus services, and has been proposed for charging internet access. It also has been extensively studied and advocated by mainstream transport economists for ports, waterways, airports and road pricing, though actual implementation is rather limited due to the controversial issues subject to debate regarding this policy, particularly for urban roads, such as undesirable distribution effects, the disposition of the revenues raised, and <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>political</b> acceptability of the congestion charge.|$|E
