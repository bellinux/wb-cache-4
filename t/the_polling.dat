5|$|Polling {{conducted}} between late December 2012 to mid-January 2013 by Civic Science {{found that}} a race between Luke Ravenstahl and Bill Peduto would be within single digit percentage points. <b>The</b> <b>polling</b> firm, however, emphasized that the poll {{was not intended to}} provide two-way race numbers and that <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> (which was completed on January 16) did not include Michael Lamb, who had entered the race the next day. According to the poll, blue-collar primary voters were more apt to support Ravenstahl while white-collar primary voters were more apt to support Peduto.|$|E
5|$|Although Republicans {{expressed}} anger {{with his}} actions, the 1867 elections generally went Democratic. No seats in Congress were directly elected in <b>the</b> <b>polling,</b> but the Democrats {{took control of}} the Ohio General Assembly, allowing them to defeat for re-election one of Johnson's strongest opponents, Senator Benjamin Wade. Voters in Ohio, Connecticut, and Minnesota turned down propositions to grant African Americans the vote.|$|E

5|$|Elections {{are governed}} by the State Electoral Commission and electoral boards. Members of those bodies are {{required}} to have a university degree in law, {{and they may not}} be members of any political party. The State Electoral Commission prepares and manages elections in accordance with legislation, appoints lower-ranking election-commission and board members, issues directives to such bodies and supervises their work. The State Electoral Commission compiles and publishes candidate lists, supervises the legality of political campaigns and compiles and publishes election results. All members of election boards (or their legal deputies) must be present at assigned polling stations at all times while <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> station is open. The board verifies the identity of voters against the list of registered voters and records the turnout. The turnout number is later checked against number of votes cast; if the number of votes exceeds the turnout, the election at that polling station must be repeated. Votes are tallied by hand, and that information is forwarded (along with all other records kept at <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> station) to the State Electoral Commission.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{he could}} not {{guarantee}} the integrity of <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> places, Clayton canceled fall elections in counties where political violence had broken out. In doing so, however, he further reduced the Democratic vote, and the state ended up supporting the election of President Grant, the Republican candidate, despite the population being mostly Democratic.|$|E
5|$|The home of John Magill {{was used}} as <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> place.

5|$|After the referendum, {{the ballot}} for Quebec {{elections}} was redesigned {{to reduce the}} size of the space where voters could indicate their choice and the rules on allowable markings were relaxed, so that Deputy Returning Officers would have fewer grounds for rejecting ballots. The Quebec government also changed the Electoral Act so that voters would need to show a Canadian passport, Quebec drivers' licence or Quebec provincial health care card at <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> station for identification purposes in future elections.|$|E
5|$|In 1799, a schoolhouse was {{constructed}} on West Creek near Benton. It {{was one of}} the first schoolhouses in the vicinity of Benton. During the 1864 elections, at least two Union soldiers were stationed on the creek, guarding <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> venues. A mill called the Thomas Mill was built on the creek in 1865 and remained operational in 1914, when it was owned by N.B. Cole. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, there was a timber-producing business on the creek, run by J. Harvey Creveling.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>poll</b> is {{especially}} important in riding, as correct flexion at <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> joint {{is a sign that}} the horse is properly on the bit. Over-flexion, with <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> lowered and <b>the</b> neck bent at a cervical vertebra farther down the neck, is usually a sign that the horse is either evading contact or that the rider is trying to pull the horse onto the bit, rather than correctly ride from behind. In classical dressage, <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> should always be the highest point on the horse when the horse is on the bit. The horse is always relaxed over <b>the</b> <b>poll,</b> giving it a relaxed look when going about its job. When, for example, the third vertebra (C3) is the highest point on the neck, rather than <b>the</b> <b>poll,</b> it is a clear sign of incorrect work.|$|R
25|$|Entropy is {{a measure}} of unpredictability of the state, or equivalently, of its average {{information}} content. To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such <b>polls</b> happen because <b>the</b> outcome of <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> is not already known. In other words, the outcome of <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> is relatively unpredictable, and actually performing <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> and learning <b>the</b> results gives some new information; these are just different ways of saying that the a priori entropy of <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> results is large. Now, consider the case that <b>the</b> same <b>poll</b> is performed a second time shortly after <b>the</b> first <b>poll.</b> Since <b>the</b> result of <b>the</b> first <b>poll</b> is already known, the outcome of <b>the</b> second <b>poll</b> can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the a priori entropy of <b>the</b> second <b>poll</b> result is small relative to that of the first.|$|R
5|$|One {{third of}} the council is elected each year, {{followed}} by one year without elections. At the 2008 election, for example, there were 70 candidates contesting 20 seats. In 2007, turnout at <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> stations ranged from 26% in Orton Longueville to 55% in Central ward. At the previous election, voters were required to provide a signature before being issued with a ballot paper. This pilot scheme trialled new procedures which are now included in the Electoral Administration Act 2006.|$|E
5|$|Croatia's county prefects, {{city and}} town mayors are elected to {{four-year}} terms {{by a majority}} of votes cast within applicable local government units, with a runoff election if no candidate achieves a majority {{in the first round of}} voting. Members of county, city and municipal councils are elected to four-year terms through proportional representation, with the entire local government unit as a single constituency. The number of council members is defined by the councils themselves, based on applicable legislation. Electoral committees are tasked with determining whether the national minorities are represented in the council (as required by the constitution), adding further members to the council (who belong to the appropriate minorities) by selecting them from unelected-candidate lists. Election silence, as in all other elections in Croatia, is enforced on the day of the elections and the previous day, ending at 7:00pm when <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> stations close and exit polls may be announced.|$|E
5|$|Polling {{conducted}} throughout March 2009 by Maurice de Hond {{indicated the}} Party for Freedom {{was the most}} popular parliamentary party. The polls predicted that the party would take 21% of the national vote, winning 32 out of 150 seats in the Dutch parliament. If <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> results were replicated in an election, Wilders would be a major power broker. Under such circumstances, there would also be some likelihood of him becoming Prime Minister of the Netherlands. This has been partially attributed to timely prosecution attempts against him for hate speech and the travel ban imposed on him by the United Kingdom, as well as dissatisfaction with the Dutch government's response to the global financial crisis of 2008â€“2009.|$|E
50|$|Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman were on {{the ballot}} but did not {{actively}} compete in <b>the</b> 2011 straw <b>poll.</b> <b>The</b> day after <b>the</b> <b>poll,</b> on August 14, Tim Pawlenty announced his withdrawal from the race after his third-place finish.

5|$|The Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act {{provide for}} a minimum of nine {{opposition}} representatives in Parliament. After <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> results for a general election have been released, the opposition candidates receiving the highest percentage of votes in their electoral divisions but not elected into Parliament will be offered NCMP seats. However, this is subject to several conditions. There must be less than nine opposition members voted into Parliament, and the candidate must have garnered at least 15% {{of the total number of}} votes polled at the election in the electoral division he or she contested in. In addition, there can be no more than two NCMPs from one Group Representation Constituency ("GRC") and no more than one NCMP from an electoral division that is not a GRC.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>polling</b> for {{the presidential}} {{election}} began on 15 July 2002 in Parliament and the state assemblies, with the media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone conclusion; the count was held on 18 July. Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy victory, and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July. Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before becoming the President. Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Dr Zakir Hussain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the President of India. He {{was also the first}} scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.|$|E
5|$|The {{referendum}} {{that was}} held to adopt the state symbols took place on May 14, 1995. With a voter turnout of 64.7%, the new flag was approved by {{a majority in the}} ratio of three to one (75.1% to 24.9%). The other three questions were also passed by the voters. The way of carrying out the referendum as well as the legality of questioning the national symbols on a referendum was heavily criticized by the opposition. Opposition parties claimed that only 48.7% of the entire voting population (75.1% of the 64.7% who showed at <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> stations) supported the adoption of the new flag, but Belarusian law (as in many other countries) states that only a majority of voters is needed to decide on a referendum issue. Upon the results going in favor of President Lukashenko, he proclaimed that the return of the Soviet-style flag brought a sense of youth and pleasant memories to the nation.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} eight {{members of}} the parliament are elected from the twelfth constituency. It encompasses the entire country; candidates in this constituency are elected by voters belonging to 22 recognized minorities in Croatia: the Serb minority elects three MPs, the Hungarians and Italians elect one MP each, the Czech and Slovak minorities jointly elect one MP, and all other minorities elect the final two MPs. Minority MPs are elected by simple plurality system (candidates with the most number of votes are elected). The nationality of the voters is listed in the voter registry, which {{is provided by the}} registrar's office that maintains Croatia's vital records. Voter nationalities are normally officially declared by the parents at birth, but any citizen may declare or change that information later on at the registrar's office at least 14 days ahead of elections (not at <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> station). The voter's nationality need not be declared or may be declared as unknown. During elections, voters who have officially declared they belong to one of the recognized minorities in Croatia may choose to vote for either a territorially applicable list or a corresponding national minority list; a voter of unknown or non-declared nationality may vote for either a territorially applicable list or any minority list; a voter who has declared a nationality other than Croat or a recognized minority may vote only for a territorially applicable list (the same as someone who has declared themselves a Croat).|$|E
5|$|The {{applicant}} for {{an election}} {{to be avoided}} may ask for a declaration that the election is void, that a particular candidate was wrongfully declared to have been elected, and/or that another candidate was duly elected. The applicant may also request for a scrutinyâ€“ that is, a re-examination of the ballot papersâ€“ {{if he or she}} alleges that an unsuccessful candidate had a majority of lawful votes. When a scrutiny is conducted, the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if the voter was not on the register of electors assigned to <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> station at which the vote was recorded or was not authorized to vote at the station; if the vote was obtained by bribery, treating or undue influence; if the voter committed or induced someone to commit the offence of personation; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a matter that the voter was aware of or was sufficiently publicized or widely known. During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added. On the other hand, a registered elector's vote will not be struck off at a scrutiny just because he or she was not qualified to be on the electoral register, and the returning officer's decision {{as to whether or not}} a ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} members of the councils is defined by the councils themselves, based on {{applicable}} legislation. Electoral committees are then tasked with determining whether the national ethnic minorities are represented on the council as required by the constitution. Further members who belong to the minorities may be added to the council in no candidate of that minority has been elected through the proportional representation system. Election silence, as in all other types of elections in Croatia, when campaigning is forbidden, is enforced the day before the election and continues until 19:00 hours on the election day when <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> stations close and exit polls may be announced. Six nationwide local elections have been held in Croatia since 1990, the most recent being the 2009 local elections to elect county prefects and councils, and city and municipal councils and mayors. In 2009, the HDZ-led coalitions won a majority or plurality in fifteen county councils and thirteen county prefect elections. SDP-led coalitions won a majority or plurality in five county councils, including the city of Zagreb council, and the remaining county council election was won by IDS-SDP coalition. The SDP won four county prefect elections and the city of Zagreb mayoral election, the HSS won three county prefect elections, and the HNS and the HDSSB won a single county prefect election each.|$|E

5000|$|Specifically, the [...] "poll" [...] {{refers to}} the {{occipital}} protrusion {{at the back of}} the skull. However, in common usage, many horsemen refer to <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> joint, between <b>the</b> atlas (C1) and skull as <b>the</b> <b>poll.</b> <b>The</b> area at the joint has a slight depression, and is a sensitive location. Thus, because the crownpiece of a bridle passes over <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> joint, a rider can indirectly exert pressure on <b>the</b> horse's <b>poll</b> by means of the reins, bit, and bridle.|$|R
