5|$|Boletus edulis is {{well suited}} to drying—its flavour intensifies, it is easily reconstituted, and its {{resulting}} texture is pleasant. Reconstitution is done by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it <b>too</b> <b>can</b> be used in subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans. Some of this content is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, <b>too,</b> <b>can</b> be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, players can use a wide variety of weapons, {{including}} plastic bags, baseball bats, crowbars and a variety of bladed items. Later in the game, firearms become available (which cannot be used for executions). Should players take damage, their health depletes; health can be restored through the use of painkillers, which are available throughout each scene. Players also have a stamina meter which depletes as they sprint, but automatically replenishes when remaining stationary. Manhunt also makes use of the PlayStation 2's optional USB Microphone and the Xbox Live microphone feature on the Xbox in their respective versions of the game. When such a device is connected, players can use the sound of their own voice to distract in-game enemies. This adds an extra element to the stealth aspect of the game, as players must refrain from making noises such as coughing as these sounds <b>too</b> <b>can</b> attract the attention of any nearby hunters.|$|E
25|$|Wearing {{a condom}} <b>too</b> loose <b>can</b> defeat the barrier.|$|R
50|$|Stretching for {{too long}} or <b>too</b> much <b>can</b> give way to an injury. For most activities, the normal range of motion is more than adequate. Any sudden {{movements}} or going <b>too</b> fast <b>can</b> cause a muscle to tighten. This leads to extreme pain and the performer should let the muscle relax by resting.|$|R
50|$|Information {{received}} {{too quickly}} or <b>too</b> late <b>can</b> cause over- or underreaction, even oscillations.|$|R
5|$|Since beetles form such a {{large part}} of the world's biodiversity, their {{conservation}} is important, and equally, loss of habitat and biodiversity is essentially certain to impact on beetles. Unfortunately, with exceptions for groups such as ladybirds and fireflies, beetles as a whole have a less positive image than other insect groups like the butterflies: many are indeed pests, and others arouse disgust. Many species of beetles have very specific habitats and long life cycles that make them vulnerable. Some species are highly threatened while others are already feared extinct. Island species tend to be more susceptible as in the case of Helictopleurus undatus of Madagascar which is thought to have gone extinct during the late 20th century. Conservationists have attempted to arouse a liking for beetles with flagship species like the stag beetle, Lucanus cervus, and tiger beetles (Cicindelidae). In Japan the Genji firefly, Luciola cruciata, is extremely popular, and in South Africa the Addo elephant dung beetle offers promise for broadening ecotourism beyond the big five tourist mammal species. Popular dislike of pest beetles, <b>too,</b> <b>can</b> be turned into public interest in insects, as can unusual ecological adaptations of species like the fairy shrimp hunting beetle, Cicinis bruchi.|$|E

25|$|Because peptide chains have a {{directionality}} conferred {{by their}} N-terminus and C-terminus, β-strands <b>too</b> <b>can</b> {{be said to}} be directional. They are usually represented in protein topology diagrams by an arrow pointing toward the C-terminus. Adjacent β-strands can form hydrogen bonds in antiparallel, parallel, or mixed arrangements.|$|E
25|$|Other {{monovalent}} cations, e.g. ammonium, NH4+, and divalent cations of the alkali earth metal {{group of}} the periodic table, e.g. calcium, Ca2+, ions generally elicit a bitter rather than a salty taste even though they, <b>too,</b> <b>can</b> pass directly through ion channels in the tongue, generating an action potential.|$|E
25|$|Human {{beings and}} members of other species, {{especially}} animals, necessarily experience ageing and mortality. Fungi, <b>too,</b> <b>can</b> age. In contrast, many species can be considered immortal: for example, bacteria fission to produce daughter cells, strawberry plants grow runners to produce clones of themselves, and animals in the genus Hydra have a regenerative ability by which they avoid dying of old age.|$|E

50|$|A typical {{training}} routine {{begins with}} the use of a well-fitted corset and very gradual decreases in the waist circumference. Lacing too tight <b>too</b> fast <b>can</b> cause extreme discomfort and short-term problems such as shortness of breath and faintness, indigestion, and chafing of the skin if a liner is not worn. Lacing too tight or <b>too</b> fast <b>can</b> irreversibly damage a corset and they should be seasoned appropriately.|$|R

25|$|English has {{a number}} of other kinds of {{compound}} verb idioms. There are compound verbs with two verbs (e.g. make do). These <b>too</b> <b>can</b> take idiomatic prepositions (e.g. get rid of). There are also idiomatic combinations of verb and adjective (e.g. come true, run amok) and verb and adverb (make sure), verb and fixed noun (e.g. go ape); and these, too, may have fixed idiomatic prepositions (e.g. take place on).|$|E
25|$|With {{those who}} are {{concerned}} with becoming masters of strategy, Musashi points out that as a carpenter becomes better with his tools {{and is able to}} craft things with more expert measure, so <b>too</b> <b>can</b> a warrior or strategist become more skilled in his technique. However, just as a carpenter {{needs to be able to}} use his tools according to plans, so too must a strategist be able to adapt his style or technique to the required strategy of the battle he is currently engaged in.|$|E
25|$|Within context, {{some of the}} {{banknotes}} have figurative meanings {{with the}} 100-krone note {{sometimes referred to as}} a hund (dog) shortening the word hundrede (a hundred). The 500-krone note can be referred to as a plovmand (ploughman) because previous circulations of the note featured a picture of a man with a plough and the 1000-krone note, <b>too,</b> <b>can</b> be referred to as a tudse (toad) taken from a wordplay on the word tusinde meaning a thousand. The 1000-krone note may also be referred to as an egern (squirrel) because of previous circulations of the note featuring a squirrel.|$|E

25|$|The HUD {{has also}} been altered. Egosoft removed {{non-functional}} internal cockpit graphics, giving the player a largely unobstructed view of space. There are now markers over game objects such as ships, stations and large asteroids, and each object is selectable by a simple mouse click, or through a keyboard or controller. X3 uses a new interface designed to be faster, more user friendly, and compatible with a console controller. The game carries over {{many of the same}} short-cut keys from previous games, but now the mouse <b>too</b> <b>can</b> be used for functions including menu navigation, target selection, flying and combat.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes two {{different}} authors {{have been published}} under the same name. This can happen {{if there is a}} title which is identical to another title or to a collective uniform title. This, <b>too,</b> <b>can</b> cause confusion. Different authors can be distinguished correctly from each other by, for example, adding a middle initial to one of the names; in addition, other information can be added to one entry to clarify the subject, such as birth year, death year, range of active years such as 1918–1965 when the person flourished, or a brief descriptive epithet. When cataloguers come across different subjects with similar or identical headings, they can disambiguate them using authority control.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} an {{optimization}} problem is: Find the shortest curve between two points on a surface, assuming that the curve must also lie on the surface. If the surface is a plane, then the shortest curve is a line. But if the surface is, for example, egg-shaped, then the shortest path is not immediately clear. These paths are called geodesics, {{and one of the}} simplest problems in the calculus of variations is finding geodesics. Another example is: Find the smallest area surface filling in a closed curve in space. This surface is called a minimal surface and it, <b>too,</b> <b>can</b> be found using the calculus of variations.|$|E
50|$|Clutch delay valves {{operate on}} the {{principle}} that engagement only needs to occur at a certain rate to be efficient and that engaging at a quicker rate can damage the drive train components of an automobile. Engaging the drive train to the engine <b>too</b> quickly <b>can</b> damage drive train parts, including the transmission, differential, half shafts, axles, and CV joints. Engaging the drive train <b>too</b> slowly <b>can</b> damage the clutch friction disc and cause clutch slippage.|$|R

25|$|Rank {{and status}} are fixed from birth. There {{is no way}} in Tongan society to climb up in rank. A low ranking chief will always remain the lesser of a high ranking chief, even though his lands may be bigger and richer and so forth. But he can try to marry a high ranking woman, for {{instance}} if she is interested in his rich lands, and so increase the rank of his children. Status on the other hand, although usually fixed <b>too,</b> <b>can</b> have some vertical movement. The second son of a noble, normally not in line for his father's title, may get it after all if his older brother dies prematurely. In addition to this sometimes, but very rarely, the king may elevate some person to high status.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{changing}} Katrina's mind, Jack, Montoya and Guiteau {{find out that}} Valek has seized the cross and they arrive at an old church to kill more vampires, but they are soon set up as Cardinal Alba sides with Valek and kidnaps Crow, revealing that his plan all along was being turned by Valek so he <b>too</b> <b>can</b> become immortal. Katrina turns into a vampire and allies herself with Valek after biting Montoya. Cardinal Alba agrees to perform a ritual using the cross which will allow vampires to walk in sunlight and be invulnerable, but Guiteau, who was in hiding, appears and kills him before he can finish the ritual. Montoya and Guiteau then rescue Crow as the sun rises, and Crow heads off to confront Valek, whom he kills by ramming the Berziers cross into his chest and exposing him to sunlight, which causes Valek to explode.|$|E
25|$|When altered flow regimes have {{impacted}} {{riparian zone}} health, re-establishing natural streamflow {{may be the}} best solution to effectively restore riparian ecosystems. The complete removal of dams and flow-altering structures may be required to fully restore historic conditions, but this is not always realistic or feasible. An alternative to dam removal is for periodic flood pulses consistent with historical magnitude and timing to be simulated by releasing large amounts of water at once instead of maintaining more consistent flows throughout the year. This would allow overbank flooding, which is vital for maintaining the health of many riparian ecosystems. However, simply restoring a more natural flow regime also has logistical constraints, as legally appropriated water rights may not include the maintenance of such ecologically important factors. Reductions in groundwater pumping may also help restore riparian ecosystems by reestablishing groundwater levels that favor riparian vegetation; however, this <b>too</b> <b>can</b> be hampered by the fact that groundwater withdrawal regulations do not usually incorporate provisions for riparian protection.|$|E
