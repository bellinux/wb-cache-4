5|$|Another {{parasitic}} trematode {{example is}} seen in a terrestrial setting. Leucochloridium is a genus of flatworm (phylum Platyhelminthes) which matures in the intestine of songbirds. Their eggs pass out of the bird in the feces and are then taken in by Succinea, a terrestrial snail that lives in moist environments. The eggs develop into larvae inside this intermediate host, and then must {{find their way into}} the digestive system of a suitable bird. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these birds do not eat snails, so the sporocyst must find some way of manipulating its future host into eating it. Unlike related species, these parasites are brightly colored and able to move in a pulsating manner. A sporocyst sac forces its way into the snail's eye stalks, and pulsates at high speed, enlarging the tentacle in the process. It also affects the host's behavior: the snail moves towards light, which it usually avoids. These combined factors make the sporocysts highly conspicuous, such that they are soon eaten by a hungry songbird. The snail then regenerates its tentacles, and Leucochloridium carries on with its life cycle.|$|E
25|$|Another {{suggestion}} for simplifying {{the proof is}} to make greater use of representation theory. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> representation theory seems to require very tight control over the subgroups of a group {{in order to work}} well. For groups of small rank one has such control and representation theory works very well, but for groups of larger rank no-one has succeeded in using it to simplify the classification. In {{the early days of the}} classification there was considerable effort made to use representation theory, but this never achieved much success in the higher rank case.|$|E
25|$|It {{also must}} {{double as a}} clean room to {{preserve}} the science value of the samples. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> while it {{is relatively easy to}} simply contain the samples once returned to Earth, researchers would also want to remove parts of the sample and use them in experiments. During all these handling procedures, the samples would need to be contained to prevent contamination of Earth. However {{at the same time the}} samples would need to be kept free from contamination by Earth micro-organisms and biological material; even a single amino acid of Earth origin could confuse the analysis. This introduces conflicting requirements. They surely can be reconciled but to date, no facility has had to do this, so new building requirements would need to be imposed.|$|E
2500|$|I've seen kosher {{slaughter}} {{really done}} right, so <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> not kosher slaughter. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> {{a plant that}} is doing everything wrong they can do wrong". In 2006 the Orthodox Union, Temple Grandin and Agriprocessors had reportedly resolved their problems.

2500|$|However, again <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{numerous}} atheists such as Arthur Schopenhauer, Bertrand Russell, A.C.

[...] Put frankly, those who term themselves spiritual {{do not have a}} monopoly on either compassion or civility.|$|E
2500|$|Again, we are {{presently}} unable to calculate results below the critical temperature, because the particle numbers using the above equation become negative. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Thomas–Fermi approximation {{has set the}} degeneracy of the ground state to zero, which is wrong. There is no ground state to accept the condensate and so the equation breaks down.

2500|$|The White House administrations of both George Bush {{senior and}} Bill Clinton criticized the genre.

Until its discontinuation on July 8, 2006, BET ran a late-night segment titled [...] to air nearly-uncensored videos.

50|$|A more {{satisfactory}} way to proceed {{would be to}} tie regions together at the industry level.

50|$|If, for example, {{the data}} sets are {{temperature}} readings from two different sensors (a Celsius sensor and a Fahrenheit sensor) {{and you want to}} know which sensor is better by picking the one with the least variance, then you will be misled if you use CV. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> you have divided by a relative value rather than an absolute.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{increasing}} {{competition in}} this market {{is likely to increase}} production (since monopolists restrict production).

2500|$|In November 2006, Romney {{then used}} his {{emergency}} budget-revision authority {{to cut the}} $450 million from the budget, saying: [...] "One of the primary responsibilities of government is keeping the books balanced. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> not revenues; <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is overspending. <b>The</b> level of spending which we're looking at would put us on the same road to financial crisis and ruin that our commonwealth has been down before."

5000|$|He {{adds that}} [...] "Attempts {{have been made}} to {{organize}} productive societies without the profit motive (...) but since the industrial revolution... there have been essentially no successful economies that have not taken advantage of the profit motive."

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b>  the {{decision-making}} process for a protocol upgrade or {{change is not}} well defined, lacks transparency and more importantly, it still uses legacy mediums, like forums, discussion websites or even requires sometimes physical meetups {{to try to reach}} a consensus.

5000|$|The {{other common}} {{translation}} of this word is folk musician. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Swedish word [...] "folkmusiker," [...] meaning folk musician, was invented explicitly {{in opposition to}} the older word [...] "spelman."

30|$|Ontologies {{by default}} support logic-based reasoning.

With such a conceptualization, existing ontologies can get annotated without any structural adjustments.|$|R

50|$|Finally, Parnaby {{addresses}} {{the ways in}} which CPTED professionals rope their clients into becoming willing participants. They made it seem that risk management was an individual’s moral, ethical, and civic responsibility. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it became the view that governments did not have the resources available to manage risk of crime completely, claiming that personal safety is also an individual’s responsibility.

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{deterrence}} theories ("the penalty {{for a crime}} should be the minimal one necessary to deter commission of it") don't give enough guidance on how much deterrence should we aim at.
