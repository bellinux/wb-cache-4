5|$|In the High Middle Ages, {{although}} the Scottish economy was still dominated by agriculture and by short-distance, local trade, {{there was an}} increasing amount of foreign trade. Coins were replacing barter goods, with Scottish coins being struck from the reign of David I. Mints were established at Berwick, Roxburgh, Edinburgh and Perth, but {{until the end of}} the period most exchange was done without the use of metal currency, and English coins probably outnumbered Scottish ones. Until the disruption caused by the outbreak of the Wars of Independence in the early fourteenth century, most naval <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> probably coastal and most foreign <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> with England. The wars closed English markets and raised the levels of piracy and disruption to naval trade on both sides. They may have led to an increase in continental trade, and isolated references indicate that Scottish ships were active in Norway and Danzig, and the earliest records from the 1330s indicate that five-sixths of this <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> in the hands of Scottish merchants.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the Eurasian Customs Union in 2010, trade between member states rose sharply. In 2011 mutual <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> USD 63.1 billion, 33.9% more than in 2010. In 2012, mutual <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> USD 67.9 billion and combined exports reached USD 593.7 billion, while imports were USD 340.9 billion. The first integration stage primarily enhanced trade among member states, bolstered economies and created a legal and institutional foundation for the member states. The second stage includes the free movements of goods, people, services and capital.|$|E
5|$|The {{wool and}} cloth <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> {{primarily}} now {{being run by}} English merchants themselves rather than by foreigners. Increasingly, the <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> also passing through London and the ports of the South-West. By the 1360s, 66–75% of the export <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> in English hands and by the 15th century this had risen to 80%; London managed around 50% of these exports in 1400, {{and as much as}} 83% of wool and cloth exports by 1540. The growth in the numbers of chartered trading companies in London, such as the Worshipful Company of Drapers or the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London, continued, and English producers began to provide credit to European buyers, {{rather than the other way}} around. Usury grew during the period, and few cases were prosecuted by the authorities.|$|E

5|$|This <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> legally {{limited to}} Spain: the Spanish Crown {{enforced}} a monopsony which limited supplies and enabled Spanish merchants {{to mark up}} prices and increase profits. British and Portuguese merchants broke this monopsony by resorting to contraband trade.|$|E
5|$|With {{his father}} usually not home (and {{eventually}} meeting his death) {{because of a}} military career, Van Rensselaer's mother sent him to apprentice with his uncle, Wolfert van Bijler, a jeweler and diamond merchant. At the time, the gem <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> a prosperous enterprise to join, being a well-developed craft. In those days, the diamond <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> nearly always combined with the trade in pearls, other articles of luxury, and rarities of every description. Dutch jewelers found a ready market for their valuable wares at the Dutch imperial court and the smaller German courts. This realm of work promoted Van Rensselaer {{to a life of}} economic success.|$|E
5|$|Although {{primarily}} rural, England had {{a number}} of old, economically important towns in 1066. A large amount of trade came through the Eastern towns, including London, York, Winchester, Lincoln, Norwich, Ipswich and Thetford. Much of this <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> with France, the Low Countries and Germany, but the North-East of England traded with partners as far away as Sweden. Cloth was already being imported to England before the invasion through the mercery trade.|$|E

5|$|Another side <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> {{smuggling}} {{along the}} Pacific {{coast of the}} Spanish Empire, where foreign <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> prohibited by Spanish law. This trade peaked in the 1810s, then faded in the 1820s. Traders concentrated on Alta California, which produced a surplus of grain, beef, tallow, and hides, but was chronically short of manufactured goods. American ships brought goods to the missions of Alta California in exchange for grain, beef, and Californian sea otter skins. The grain, beef, and other provisions were taken to Sitka, which was perennially short of foods supplies. After Mexico gained independence in 1821 the American trade with Alta California continued in a slightly modified form. American traders brought mostly clothing, cottons, silks, lace, cutlery, alcohol, and sugar, which were traded for hides and tallow at a profit generally between 200% and 300%. The California Hide Trade became a major industry in its own right. By the 1830s, however, the missions of Alta California had been secularized by Mexican authorities and deserted by Indian labourers. The trade slid into unprofitability. The decline of the American trade with Alta California left just one significant alternative to the ever-dwindling sea otter trade—the provisioning of the settlements of Russian America, which lasted until the Americans abandoned the North West Coast altogether in the early 1840s. From {{the first decade of}} the 19th century until 1841 American ships visited Sitka regularly, trading provisions, textiles, and liquor for fur seal skins, timber, and fish. This <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> usually highly profitable for the Americans and the Russian settlements depended on it. Thus when Tsar NicholasI issued the ukase of 1821, banning foreign trade north of the 51st parallel, the Russian colonies in America were forced to ignore the ban and engage in smuggling.|$|E
5|$|Aristagoras {{was also}} {{successful}} in persuading {{the city of}} Eretria to send assistance to the Ionians {{for reasons that are}} not completely clear. Possibly commercial reasons were a factor; Eretria was a mercantile city, whose <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> threatened by Persian dominance of the Aegean. Herodotus suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order to repay the support the Milesians had given Eretria some time previously, possibly referring to the Lelantine War.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} decade of the century, the {{political}} climate in Europe was feverish: the War of the League of Cambrai had begun. The French, under Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours, had sacked Brescia in 1512, the town now in ruins and the myth of Brixia magnipotens shattered. A lively era of humanism and <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> ended, a phenomenon that would affect the rest of the peninsula in the following decades.|$|E
50|$|The {{opposite}} of systematic <b>trading</b> <b>is</b> discretionary <b>trading.</b> The disadvantage of discretionary <b>trading</b> <b>is</b> {{that it may}} be influenced by emotions, isn't easily back tested, and has less rigorous risk control.|$|R
50|$|The 1970s {{also saw}} more trades {{added to the}} LORE Branch, and {{existing}} trades condensed. For example, all the trades pertaining to repair of vehicles were grouped together into the vehicle technician's trade, all weapon-related <b>trades</b> <b>were</b> combined into the weapons technician trade, and all electrical <b>trades</b> <b>were</b> grouped together into the electro-mechanical technician. All the material-support <b>trades</b> <b>were</b> transferred to the air force.|$|R

40|$|Crossed and internalized upstairs <b>trades</b> <b>are</b> {{analysed}} in a dataset {{in which}} institutional investors can be identified. Earlier findings that upstairs <b>trading</b> <b>is</b> uninformed, taps into unexpressed liquidity, {{and does not}} affect market quality are revisited. The permanent price effect of crossings and internalized upstairs <b>trades</b> <b>is</b> significantly {{lower than that of}} limit order book trades {{due to the fact that}} the least informed institutional <b>trades</b> <b>are</b> routed upstairs. Crossed and internalized trades affect the depth and transaction costs in the limit order book and a greater reliance is placed on the upstairs market when liquidity is low and volatility is high.

50|$|Industrialization, {{advanced}} technology, including transportation, globalization, multinational corporations, and outsourcing are all {{having a}} major impact on the international trade system. Increasing international <b>trade</b> <b>is</b> crucial to the continuance of globalization. Without international <b>trade,</b> nations would <b>be</b> limited to the goods and services produced within their own borders. International <b>trade</b> <b>is,</b> in principle, not different from domestic trade as the motivation and the behavior of parties involved in a trade do not change fundamentally regardless of whether <b>trade</b> <b>is</b> across a border or not. The main difference <b>is</b> that international <b>trade</b> <b>is</b> typically more costly than domestic <b>trade.</b> The reason <b>is</b> that a border typically imposes additional costs such as tariffs, time costs due to border delays and costs associated with country differences such as language, the legal system or culture.|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the decline of Bristol's Iceland trade for 'stockfish' (freeze dried cod) was a hard blow to the local economy, encouraging Bristol merchants to turn west, launching unsuccessful voyages of exploration in the Atlantic by 1480 in search of the phantom island of Hy-Brazil. More recent research, however, has shown that the Iceland <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> never more than a minor part of Bristol's overseas trade and that the English fisheries off Iceland actually increased during the late 15th and 16th centuries. In 1487, when king Henry VII visited the city, the inhabitants complained about their economic decline. Such complaints, however, were not uncommon among corporations that wished to avoid paying taxes, or which hoped to secure concessions from the Crown. In reality, Bristol's customs accounts show that the port's <b>trade</b> <b>was</b> growing strongly during the last two decades of the fifteenth century. In great part this was due of the increase of trade with Spain.|$|E
