500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 11, 1910. The film was originally planned to be released on November 4, but it was delayed and some advertisements and later listings for the film give the erroneous date. The film received negative reviews in trade publications from even those which typically praised even the weaker productions. Though it was not well-received, the production was not criticized as sharply as Avenged had been. Walton of The Moving Picture News stated that the film was [...] " [...] very feeble echo on Anthony Hope. The throne room staging is ridiculous {{and so is the}} resolution. The flag-waving business is feebly melodramatic. Princes, etc. don't sit on that sort of chair. I'm an admirer of Thanhouser, but <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> straight, plain punk. In Europe it will be received as a Yankee joke." [...] The reviewer for The Moving Picture World was decidedly neutral, highlighting only the novelty of the plot and refraining from any criticism or praise of the merits of the production. The New York Dramatic Mirror was negative, but not scathing. The reviewer stated, [...] "The narrative is very entertaining - or could be made so, if the producer had cared to trouble himself about details. In its present crude form, its wild impossibility rather grates upon a spectator, because every scene in the film has some inconsistency. At least, it was worth doing well. Unfortunately, neither the acting nor the mounting has any particular merit." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Argonauts' {{ownership}} {{responded to}} Theismann's criticism, noting that Theismann's son, Joe, {{pleaded guilty in}} 2002 to a felony charge of possessing drug paraphernalia. He received a 10-year suspended prison term, was placed on five years of probation and fined. [...] "It's really a delicate subject for him to attack someone if he has that in his own family", Argo co-owner David Cynamon said. [...] "If I was his son and he's calling [...] a drug addict and he should quit and he's a loser, I'd be shattered. <b>This</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> really bothersome." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 15, 2006, {{civil rights}} activist Jesse Jackson said that his {{non-profit}} Rainbow/Push Coalition organization {{would pay for the}} college tuition of the accuser, Mangum, whether she fabricated the story or not. Jackson said that she should never [...] "have to stoop that low to survive." [...] He continued that the [...] "...fantasy's as old as slave masters impregnating young slave girls [...] The character of <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> chilling [...] omething happened that everybody's ashamed of..." [...] Defense attorney Joe Cheshire found Jackson's comment about [...] "slave masters" [...] odd because the players did not ask for black strippers. [...] "There is no slave-master mentality here, and that's just another perfect example of [...] self-absorbed race pandering," [...] Cheshire stated.|$|E
2500|$|... “I don't {{think the}} Communists, the Marxists, {{in this country}} paid {{sufficient}} attention or made a proper study of this phenomenon. It is not a phenomenon which started one day. It {{has been there for}} one thousand years. And every educated fellow, the elite of our society, goes around saying that we are above caste. This is telling lies. Read the matrimonial columns in the papers. Yes, they don't indulge in crude forms of casteism – not allowing someone to drink out of the same glass – but will they allow a Dalit to come and sit at their table and eat with them? I doubt it very much. Of course, marriage is out of the question. <b>This</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> so deeply rooted in our psyche, this Manusmriti, this Chaturvarna , {{to get out of it}} will take a thousand years." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{the song}}'s release, Lorde teased the song on her Twitter account, saying [...] the [...] "Green Light" [...] would be [...] "different, and kinda unexpected. Complex and funny and sad and joyous and it'll make you DANCE." [...] Lorde {{announced}} {{the release of}} the single and its music video on Twitter on 2 March 2017. Later that day, in a Beats 1 interview with Zane Lowe, she also said: The song is really about those moments kind of immediately after your life changes and about all the silly little things that you gravitate towards. I say, 'She thinks you love the beach, you're such a liar.' What the fuck, she thinks you like the beach?! You don't like the beach! It's those little stupid things. It sounds so happy and then the lyrics are so intense obviously. And I realized I was like, 'how come <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> coming out so joyous sounding?' And I realized this is that drunk girl at the party dancing around crying about her ex-boyfriend who everyone thinks is a mess. That's her tonight and tomorrow she starts to rebuild. And that's the song for me.|$|E
2500|$|The Strangers are energy {{beings who}} reside in dead human bodies. When design first started, the filmmakers {{considered}} having the Strangers be bugs underneath but {{decided that the}} bug appearance was overused. Tatopoulos said Proyas {{wanted to make the}} Strangers energy beings, [...] "Alex called me and said he wanted something like an energy that kept re-powering itself, re-creating itself, re-shaping itself, sitting inside a dry piece of human shape." [...] The Strangers reside in a large underground amphitheater for their lair, where a human bust hides a large clock and a spiraling device changes the layout of the city above. The set for the lair was fifty feet (15 m) in height, where an average set is thirty-six feet (11 m). The lair set was built on a fairground in Sydney, Australia. The film's budget was $30–40 million, so the crew used inexpensive techniques to design the set, such as stretching canvas onto welded metal frames. The lair also had a rail conveyance that appeared expensive. Tatopoulos said, [...] "We had, obviously, a car built, but we had just one built. [...] We laid some rail for it to ride on. We made a section of corridor that we kept driving through all the time, and you end up believing <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> running along forever." [...] Proyas originally wanted the rail car to roll by various rooms, which was not feasible for the budget, so Tatopoulos and the crew used [...] "replaceable elements and strong design textures" [...] to mimic the impression of various rooms.|$|E
