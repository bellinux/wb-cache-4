5|$|A {{decompression}} {{schedule is}} a specified ascent rate and series of increasingly shallower decompression stops—often for {{increasing amounts of}} time—that a diver performs to outgas inert gases from their body during ascent to the surface {{to reduce the risk}} of decompression sickness. In a decompression dive, the decompression phase may make up a large part of the time spent underwater (in many cases it is longer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> time spent at depth).|$|E
5|$|The British {{followed}} the main raids and {{were aware of}} all the approaching aircraft, save for the low-altitude 9 Staffel. The radar station near Dover began reporting a build-up over the Pas-de-Calais area. This activity increased until 12:45 when six separate concentrations were reported. The plotters estimated {{the strength of the}} force as 350 aircraft, one-third more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> size.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} rate of supernova production in a galaxy {{the size of}} the Milky Way is about one every 50years. This is much higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> observed rate, implying that a portion of these events have been obscured from the Earth by interstellar dust. The deployment of new instruments that can observe across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, along with neutrino detectors, means that the next such event will almost certainly be detected.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{preliminary}} report on the hurricane, neither track forecasts or intensity forecasts panned out for the storm. The track forecasts called for a path more northward <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> track whereas following {{the development of the}} eye, intensity forecasts called for further strengthening until it became clear the cyclone was weakening. When it was upgraded to a hurricane on August 8, Cora became the second hurricane to have been upgraded to that intensity based solely on satellite presentation after 1975's Hurricane Doris. The hurricane was also the second of three storms in the season to reform or be reclassified as East Pacific storms. The other two were Tropical Storm Bess (which became Hurricane Iva), and Hurricane Greta-Olivia. Of these, only Greta maintained its circulation over land. This was the only time an Atlantic hurricane was named Cora.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{patterns}} of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The three body scatter spike is an example. This {{is the result}} of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground, where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar. The energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back, as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the radar, and the echo is further away from the radar <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.|$|E
5|$|Pale Blue Dot, {{which was}} {{taken with the}} narrow-angle camera, was also {{published}} {{as part of a}} composite picture created from a wide-angle camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The wide-angle image was inset with two narrow-angle pictures: Pale Blue Dot and a similar photograph of Venus. The wide-angle photograph was taken with the darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. Even so, the result was a bright burned-out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera and the Sun that appears far larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> dimension of the solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide-angle lens.|$|E

5|$|The first {{quantitative}} {{estimate of}} the speed of light was made in 1676 by Rømer (see Rømer's determination {{of the speed of}} light). From the observation that the periods of Jupiter's innermost moon Io appeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit. Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for the diameter of the Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of , 26% lower <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>actual</b> value.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} some {{criticism}} of the current administrative scheme as being inefficient and not conducive to regional planning.
