SR-143, which had ended at SR-1 (Main Street) in Parowan, was extended north on Main Street and a planned connection to I-15 at exit 78. However, plans had changed by the time I-15 was completed in 1975, and a second interchange (exit 75) served {{the west side of}} Parowan. SR-143 was instead rerouted south and west to meet I-15 <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> had become part of SR-143 in 1968 was instead redesignated SR-274.|$|E
2500|$|Until now Weston {{had kept}} his {{relationships}} with other women a secret from his wife, but {{as he began to}} photograph more nudes Flora became suspicious about what went on with his models. Chandler recalled that his mother regularly sent him on [...] "errands" [...] to his father's studio and asked him to tell her who was <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> they were doing.|$|E

In giving evidence, Huxley states [...] "Well, as I was saying, Owen and me is in the same trade; and we both cuts up monkeys, and I finds something in the brains of them. Hallo! says I, here's a hippocampus. No, there ain't says Owen. Look here says I. I can't see it he says and he sets to werriting and haggling about it, and goes and tells everybody, as what I finds ain't <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he finds is".|$|E

2500|$|The Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma are {{the closest}} living {{descendants}} of the Illiniwek Confederacy, having been relocated to Oklahoma in the 19th century. The position of the tribal leadership has evolved over the years. In a television interview with WICD-TV in 1995, Don Giles, then Chief of the Peoria Tribe, said, [...] "To {{say that we are}} anything but proud to have these portrayals would be completely wrong. We are proud. We're proud that the University of Illinois, the flagship university of the state, a seat of learning, is drawing on that background of our having been <b>there.</b> <b>And</b> <b>what</b> more honor could they pay us?" [...] Supporting Chief Giles was another tribal elder, Ron Froman, who stated that the protesters [...] "don't speak for all Native Americans, and certainly not us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kemp {{expressed}} that the a main {{motivation for the}} series was {{to hear from the}} soldiers who generally don't have a voice compared to other public workers. Kemp stated: [...] "I've got many friends who are in the services, but you never really hear a squaddie giving his point of view. I'd never heard one talk publicly and I wanted to hear that voice." [...] This would be the view of the young men being sent to the foreign climes of Afghanistan from a situation such as being 18 years old and still living at home with mum and dad, as opposed to hearing from officers trained in media relations. The series would examine the experiences of soldiers at home, injured soldiers and the families of serving soldiers. Kemp wanted to ascertain the motivation of the troops, their level of political knowledge about the situation, their views on Muslims. Kemp stated his opinion that the public gaining an understanding of what it's like for the soldiers is a good thing whatever anyone's political views on the war., informing the public what was happening out <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> the soldiers are doing for the people back home who are [...] "fortunate to live in a [...] country".|$|E
2500|$|Tobias {{has stayed}} up all night, and is making himself a morning cocktail. Agnes comes down from her room. [...] She tells Tobias that it is his role {{to make all the}} {{decisions}} with regards to what to do about Edna and Harry. She reminds Tobias of the time when he prevented her from getting pregnant after the death of their son. Claire, Julia, Tobias, and Agnes all discuss their versions of why Harry and Edna are <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> they should do about it. Harry and Edna join them, and everyone in the room is drinking. Edna announces that Harry wants to talk to Tobias alone, and the women exit. Harry tells Tobias that if the circumstances were reversed, he and Edna don’t think they would allow Tobias and Agnes to live at their house, {{in spite of the fact}} that they are best friends. Harry asks Tobias, “You don’t want us, do you, Toby?” [...] Tobias answers that he does not really want Harry and Edna to stay there but that because they are friends, Harry and Edna have the right to be there. [...] He goes with Harry to get their suitcases and put them back in their car. Agnes says to Edna, “Everything becomes… too late, finally.” The play ends on Agnes’s rumination that people sleep at night because they are afraid of the dark: “They say we sleep to let the demons out—to let the mind go raving mad…And when the daylight comes again... comes order with it.” ...|$|E

60|$|There was no answer, but {{the voices}} dropped suddenly. The head Chinaman went out. We heard the clink {{of ice in}} the glasses, pouring sounds, the {{shuffling}} of feet, the scraping of chairs. Schomberg, after wondering in a low mutter who the devil could be there {{at this time of}} the day, got up napkin in hand to peep through the doorway cautiously. He retreated rapidly on tip-toe, and whispering behind his hand informed me that it was Falk, Falk himself who was in <b>there,</b> <b>and,</b> <b>what's</b> more, he had Captain Hermann with him.|$|R
