5|$|Both {{teams were}} each given 12,000 <b>tickets</b> – the {{remaining}} 6,000 <b>tickets</b> were released, for purchase to the Swedish people. However, Stuttgart {{decided to send}} 11,000 of their 12,000 <b>tickets</b> back to UEFA, due to the German club's supporters finding it difficult {{to make their way}} to the country, as well as the absence of air flights available. Subsequently, none of the unsold <b>tickets</b> were granted for Chelsea and its followers; the consequences proved worse, when the side announced that they had issued <b>tickets</b> alone for those, who had ordered the more higher-priced package.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Disneyland Railroad opened, A, B, and C <b>tickets</b> were {{introduced}} in Disneyland for admission to its rides, and C <b>tickets,</b> the highest-ranked <b>tickets,</b> were required to ride the DRR. These <b>tickets</b> were joined by the higher-ranked D ticket in 1956, and D <b>tickets</b> from that point forward were needed {{to gain access to}} the DRR.|$|E

5|$|The pricing {{scheme was}} based on <b>tickets</b> for NOK399, 499, 599 and 699, plus NOK71 in taxes. At least ten <b>tickets</b> were {{available}} at the lowest price per departure, {{and the first to}} order were granted the cheapest <b>tickets.</b> <b>Tickets</b> had no restrictions on cancellation, and were not subject to restrictions on return dates.|$|E
5|$|Ticket sales {{began in}} September 2014. The Games {{expected}} to have 1.4million <b>tickets</b> for sale, with over 75% of them priced under $45. The first tranche of <b>tickets</b> was to be allocated via a lottery system. Over one million <b>tickets</b> were sold.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tickets</b> for the 2009 final {{were similar}} to ATM cards, with an {{integrated}} chip storing the ticket holder's personal information {{in order to ensure}} that the ticket is being presented by its legitimate owner. As further security, <b>tickets</b> also had to be presented with an adequate form of photographic identification. However, despite these security measures, counterfeit <b>tickets</b> were still produced, forcing UEFA to issue a statement warning people against buying <b>tickets</b> from touts.|$|E

50|$|As of 2014, {{a one-day}} non-holiday adult <b>ticket</b> to Bromley is $71, a Senior/Teen <b>ticket</b> is $61, and a Junior <b>ticket</b> is $45. Back {{in the early}} 2000s, an adult <b>ticket</b> cost around $50 {{and in the early}} 90s a <b>ticket</b> was around $35.

5|$|With {{a stadium}} {{capacity}} of 70,500, a {{total amount of}} 46,000 <b>tickets</b> were available to fans and the general public, with the two finalist teams receiving 20,000 <b>tickets</b> each and with 6,000 <b>tickets</b> being available for sale to fans worldwide via UEFA.com from 5 to 23 March 2015 in four price categories: €390, €280, €160, and €70. The rest of 24,500 <b>tickets</b> were allocated to sponsors and officials.|$|E
5|$|Although the Luzhniki Stadium had a usual {{capacity}} of almost 85,000 spectators, that {{was reduced to}} 69,500 for the final. Of those <b>tickets,</b> approximately 21,000 were reserved for each finalist club, with a further 10,500 available for purchase {{by the general public}} via the UEFA website. Recipients of those <b>tickets</b> were determined by a random ballot following an online application process that ran from 28 February to 19 March 2008. <b>Tickets</b> were available in three categories, priced at €80, €140 and €200 depending on their location in the stadium. UEFA received around 125,000 applications for <b>tickets</b> from the general public {{over the course of the}} three-week application process.|$|E
5|$|Another {{complication}} is {{release in}} multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged. One notable {{example of this}} phenomenon is Avatar, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of <b>tickets</b> for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films. Social and economic factors such as population change {{and the growth of}} international markets also impact on the number of people purchasing theater <b>tickets,</b> along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's <b>tickets,</b> or perform better in big cities where <b>tickets</b> cost more.|$|E
50|$|Cancel <b>Ticket</b> {{is to be}} used by the {{receiving}} end of the <b>ticket.</b> It takes a <b>ticket</b> and makes it invalid. For example, after receiving an email with a <b>ticket,</b> the <b>ticket</b> would then be cancelled so it is unable to be reused.|$|R

5|$|As late as December 31, neither {{team had}} sold its entire {{allotment}} of 17,500 <b>tickets.</b> Cincinnati fans had bought 13,000 <b>tickets,</b> while Virginia Tech fans bought fewer than 5,000 <b>tickets</b> from the school's allotment. Countering Virginia Tech's low direct ticket sales were {{large numbers of}} fans who avoided paying face value for tickets—US$125—by buying them on the secondary market, often {{for as little as}} 99 cents.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{high demand}} and limited {{availability}} of the reserved <b>tickets,</b> some people planned to offer their <b>tickets</b> for sale through ticket brokers, Internet auctions and classified listing services. Sales offers for <b>tickets</b> reached as high as $1,750 each for the reserved standing room section behind the Capitol Reflecting Pool, $5,500 each for the reserved standing room section {{in front of the}} Reflecting Pool and $20,000 each for the VIP section on the Capitol grounds. In one case, a former legislative aide to Representative Ted Poe was exposed by a prospective buyer after the former aide used Craigslist and e‑mail to offer five <b>tickets</b> to the buyer for $4,500.|$|E
5|$|Before the final, both finalists {{were awarded}} 12,000 <b>tickets.</b> The Danish Football Association {{announced}} that 9,000 <b>tickets</b> would be offered, {{for sale to}} the public, while the remaining 3,000 were sold to other European countries. UEFA allocated another 3,000 <b>tickets</b> to their officials and VIP members. Problems ensued after {{it was revealed that}} Galatasaray had been charging the <b>tickets</b> more than the original price, in order to prevent some football hooligans from entering the ground. The Turkish club's secretary general however, denied this and insisted that the <b>tickets</b> were being sold at their original price and to support the stadium and the club's other sporting activities.|$|E

5000|$|Henry E. Kyburg, Jr.'s lottery paradox [...] {{arises from}} {{considering}} a fair 1000-ticket lottery that has exactly one winning <b>ticket.</b> If {{this much is}} known about the execution of the lottery it is therefore rational to accept that some <b>ticket</b> will win. Suppose that an event is very likely only if the probability of it occurring is greater than 0.99. On these grounds it is presumed rational to accept the proposition that <b>ticket</b> 1 of the lottery will not win. Since the lottery is fair, it is rational to accept that <b>ticket</b> 2 will not win either—indeed, it is rational to accept for any individual <b>ticket</b> i of the lottery that <b>ticket</b> i will not win. However, accepting that <b>ticket</b> 1 will not win, accepting that <b>ticket</b> 2 will not win, and so on until accepting that <b>ticket</b> 1000 will not win entails that it is rational to accept that no <b>ticket</b> will win, which entails that it is rational to accept the contradictory proposition that one <b>ticket</b> wins and no <b>ticket</b> wins.|$|R
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 25,000 <b>tickets,</b> {{fewer than the}} 32,000 received for the semi-finals. The allocation was enough for the 21,000 Stoke City season ticket holders, but not for Manchester City's 36,000 season ticket holders. Consequently, some supporters felt aggrieved {{at the lack of}} <b>tickets,</b> including Stoke City chairman Peter Coates who expressed his disappointment and suggested an allocation in the region of 30,000 for both clubs. Ticket prices for the final exceeded £100 for the first time. The most expensive <b>tickets</b> cost £115, an increase of 22percent on the previous season. The cheapest <b>tickets</b> available at £45, up £5 from 2010.|$|E

Grande also was the opening act for the last three US dates of Justin Bieber's Believe Tour. The performances took place in Jacksonville, Tampa, and Atlanta on August 7, August 8, and August 10, in support of the album.

5|$|In {{accordance}} with changes {{made for the}} 1924 final onwards, all <b>tickets</b> were sold in advance to prevent {{a repeat of the}} overcrowding at the 1923 final. Approximately 91,000 <b>tickets</b> were available. 53,000 were standing <b>tickets,</b> 15,000 were uncovered seats and 23,000 were covered seats. Standing <b>tickets</b> cost two shillings, seat prices ranged from five shillings to one guinea. The majority of <b>tickets</b> were sold before the finalists were known. As a result, few supporters of the participating teams attended; most were unable to afford the remaining <b>tickets</b> available to the general public, which were typically in the more expensive areas of the stadium. 1,750 <b>tickets</b> were allocated directly to each club. Bolton fielded 6,000 enquiries and lodged a formal protest about the inadequacy of their allocation. The London, Midland and Scottish Railway laid on a total of seven special trains from Manchester to London on the eve and morning of the match. A number of supporters travelled to London without <b>tickets</b> in the hope of securing one outside the stadium. 5s <b>tickets</b> changed hands for up to 15s, provoking the ire of ticketless supporters who accused the sellers of profiteering. In one such instance, a man selling twenty 2s tic|kets at 10s each required the assistance of five police officers to escape the wrath of the crowd. The total gate receipts for the match were £23,157, a new record.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{approximately}} £1 million ($1.6 million) of <b>tickets</b> were pre-sold. 18,827 <b>tickets</b> pre-sold for the London IMAX, {{the largest}} IMAX {{screen in the}} country, which broke the theater records for the highest grossing week of pre-sales with £293,312 ($474,687), and the highest grossing first day of pre-sales with £137,000 ($221,717). It extended this record to 30,000 <b>tickets</b> sold and £470,977 ($737,588) earned, and become the most pre-booked film at that theater, exceeding the performance of high-profile IMAX releases including Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 and Avatar.|$|E
