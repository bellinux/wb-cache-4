40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} the design, analysis {{and performance of}} a low-voltage, highly linear switched-R-MOSFET-C filter. High linearity, even at a low supply voltage, is achieved {{through the use of}} duty-cycle-controlled tuning. Tuning MOS-FETs are switched completely on while conducting, such that their nonlinear resistance is much smaller than the linear filter resistors, resulting in low distortion. The MOSFETs are also placed inside the filter feedback loop which further reduces distortion. Because tuning is done in the time domain, rather than in the voltage domain, the tuning range is independent of the supply voltage. The filter achieves 77 dB total harmonic distortion (THD) using a 0. 6 -V supply, and 90 dB THD using a 0. 8 -V supply, with a 0. 6 -Vpp differential 2 kHz sine input. The prototype IC, implemented in a 0. 18 - m CMOS process, occupies an area of 0. 7 mmP and consumes 1 mW of power from a 0. 6 -V supply.

50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, VarioRam varies the {{effective}} {{length of the}} inlet ducting depending upon engine load and speed. A long intake length at low rpm provides a better <b>pulse</b> <b>tune</b> because the <b>pulse</b> won't travel {{back and forth as}} many times, which aids low-end torque because the high pressure pulse may otherwise contribute to reversion and thereby decreased volumetric efficiency. At higher engine rpm, the intake length is reduced. The result is a flatter torque curve, with more torque available at low- and mid-range engine speeds compared to a similar non-VarioRam engine.|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a new rapidly tunable parallel optical delay line (PODL) capable of accessing multiple high speed OTDM channels with very low latency using only one modulator operating below baseband. The PODL uses a new parallel compression scheme to rapidly <b>tune</b> <b>pulses</b> into different time slots within an OTDM frame. Since the modulator bandwidth is actually {{lower than the}} baseband of the output data, regardless of the chosen timeslot, the PODL offers an advantage over the previous tunable serial techniques in terms of simplicity and scaling towards higher optical baseband bit rate. In addition, the use of only one modulator requires only one polarization controller at the input of the PODL to optimize coupling with the modulator, and no polarization controller or polarization maintaining fiber are needed within the delay structure. The results from our demonstration of the PODL show that fast tuning among multiple high bit rate OTDM channels can be achieved and practically implemente...|$|R

40|$|This paper reports two {{advances}} {{in a slow}} light device consisting of chirped photonic crystal slab coupled waveguide on SOI substrate. One is concerning the delay-bandwidth product, indicating the buffering capacity of the device. We experimentally evaluated a record high value of 57 (a 40 ps delay and a 1. 4 THz bandwidth). We also observed ~ 1 ps wide optical pulse transmission in the cross-correlation measurement. Regarding the pulse as a signal and considering the broadening of the pulse width due to the imperfect dispersion compensation in the device, storage of more than 12 signal bits was confirmed. The other is a wide-range <b>tuning</b> of the <b>pulse</b> delay. We propose a technique for externally controlling the chirping to permit variable delay.

40|$|A novel frequency-shifted {{feedback}} (FSF) {{fiber laser}} cavity is proposed and experimentally verified. The laser generates stable mode-locked pulses of < 2 ps, mainly limited due to chirp {{induced by the}} frequency-shifting element (i. e., the acoustooptic modulator) on the pulses. Fourier transform-limited subpicosecond pulses were obtained by compensating this excess chirp using a piece of single-mode fiber SMF- 28 outside the laser cavity.

Excellent photocurrent responses of TiO 2 NTAs in UV and visible light regions were achieved by depositing Ag nanorods and nanoparticles, which was attributed to highly efficient charge separation by the Schottky junction at the Ag/TiO 2 interface and localized surface plasmon resonance effect of Ag nanostructures.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a {{one to one}} correspondence between the polarization state of a light <b>pulse</b> <b>tuned</b> to neutral exciton resonances of single semiconductor quantum dots and the spin state of the exciton that it photogenerates. This is accomplished using two variably polarized and independently <b>tuned</b> picosecond laser <b>pulses.</b> The first "writes" the spin state of the resonantly excited exciton. The second is tuned to biexcitonic resonances, and its absorption is used to "read" the exciton spin state. The absorption of the second pulse depends on its polarization relative to the exciton spin direction. Changes in the exciton spin result in corresponding changes in {{the intensity of the}} photoluminescence from the biexciton lines which we monitor, obtaining thus a one to one mapping between any point on the Poincare sphere of the light polarization to a point on the Bloch sphere of the exciton spin.
