5|$|Fellow street artist Shepard Fairey {{wrote in}} Swindle:Invader's pop art may seem shallow, but {{by taking the}} risk of {{illegally}} re-contextualizing video game characters in an urban environment that provides more chaotic social interaction than a gamer's bedroom, he makes a statement about the desensitizing nature of video games and consumer culture. In a postmodern paradox, a game like Grand Theft Auto takes <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> the streets {{and puts it in}} a safe video game, while Invader takes a safe video game icon and inserts it into <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> the streets.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{stimulus}} for continued development and emergency repairs and {{works of the}} Ragusan fortresses came {{as a result of}} <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> unexpected attack by Turkish military forces, especially after they conquered Constantinople in 1453.|$|E

5|$|After initial assessments, the HUSAR team {{felt they}} had the proper {{equipment}} for the mission.

5|$|Although {{threatening}} letters sent to BélaIV by the khans of the Golden Horde {{proved that}} <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> a new Mongol invasion still existed, he adopted an expansionist foreign policy. FrederickII of Austria died fighting against Hungarian troops in 1246, and BélaIV's son-in-law, Rostislav Mikhailovich, annexed large territories along the kingdom's southern frontiers. Conflicts between the elderly monarch and his heir, Stephen, caused {{a civil war}} in the 1260s.|$|E

5|$|Octavian {{meanwhile}} {{built up}} a private army in Italy by recruiting Caesarian veterans and, on 28 November, he won over two of Antony's legions with the enticing offer of monetary gain. In the face of Octavian's large and capable force, Antony saw <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> staying in Rome and, to the relief of the Senate, he fled to Cisalpine Gaul, {{which was to be}} handed to him on 1 January.|$|E

5|$|The Muslim siege {{forces had}} been {{weakened}} by the withdrawal of 9,000 men to repel the Byzantine relief force.

5|$|Von Neumann {{was asked}} to write an essay for the layman {{describing}} what mathematics is, and produced a beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics straddles the world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory. However, he argued, that there is always <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> straying {{too far from the}} real world and becoming irrelevant sophistry.|$|E
5|$|A seizure {{underwater}} {{requires that}} the diver {{be brought to the}} surface as soon as practicable. Although for many years the recommendation has been not to raise the diver during the seizure itself, owing to <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> arterial gas embolism (AGE), {{there is some evidence that}} the glottis does not fully obstruct the airway. This has led to the current recommendation by the Diving Committee of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society that a diver should be raised during the seizure's clonic (convulsive) phase if the regulator is not in the diver's mouth– as <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> drowning is then greater than that of AGE– but the ascent should be delayed until the end of the clonic phase otherwise. Rescuers ensure that their own safety is not compromised during the convulsive phase. They then ensure that where the victim's air supply is established it is maintained, and carry out a controlled buoyant lift. Lifting an unconscious body is taught by most diver training agencies. Upon reaching the surface, emergency services are always contacted as there is a possibility of further complications requiring medical attention. The U.S. Navy has procedures for completing the decompression stops where a recompression chamber is not immediately available.|$|E

5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off. Due to loss {{of power in the}} left engine, the flight crew were unable to control their aircraft before it struck the roof of the apartment building.

5|$|Blamey was {{involved}} in discussions with the government over {{the size of the}} Army to be maintained. Now that <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> invasion of Australia had passed, the government reconsidered how the nation's resources, particularly of manpower, should be distributed. Blamey pressed for a commitment to maintain three AIF divisions, as only they could legally be sent north of the equator where the final campaigns would be fought. He urged that the Empire Air Training Scheme be curtailed, and opposed MacArthur's proposal to use the Australian Army primarily for logistic support and leave combat roles principally to American troops.|$|E
5|$|Cleph {{kept his}} throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a slave. An {{important}} {{success for the}} Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed him, opening a decade of interregnum and making the Lombards who remained in Italy more vulnerable to attacks from Franks and Byzantines. It was only when faced with <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the Lombard dukes elected a new king {{in the person of}} Authari, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Due to its remoteness, Sangay hosts a {{significant}} biological community with fauna {{such as the}} mountain tapir, giant otter, Andean cock-of-the-rock and king vulture. Since 1983, its ecological community has been protected {{as part of the}} Sangay National Park. Although climbing the mountain is hampered by its remoteness, poor weather conditions, river flooding, and <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> falling ejecta, the volcano is regularly climbed, a feat first achieved by Robert T. Moore in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{returned}} to Australia in March 1942, and {{was promoted to}} lieutenant colonel in August. He was appointed Assistant Director of Pathology, I Corps and New Guinea Force. To combat <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> dysentery, Ford had all available supplies of sulphaguanidine in Australia shipped up to New Guinea, where Australian forces were fighting a desperate campaign against the Japanese. This was a new drug that Neil Hamilton Fairley had tested in the Middle East, and found to be effective. An initial dose of 4g followed by 2g doses at four hourly intervals was found to rapidly relieve the symptoms and permit the sufferers to travel.|$|E
5|$|Frank Spedding's Ames Project had {{developed}} the Ames process, {{a method of}} producing uranium metal on an industrial scale, but Cyril Stanley Smith, the CM Division's associate leader in charge of metallurgy, was concerned about using it with highly enriched uranium due to <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> forming a critical mass. Highly enriched uranium was also far more valuable than natural uranium, {{and he wanted to}} avoid the loss of even a milligram. He recruited Richard D. Baker, a chemist who had worked with Spedding, and together they adapted the Ames Process for use at the Los Alamos laboratory. In February Baker and his group made twenty 360 gram reductions and twenty-seven 500 gram reductions with highly enriched uranium tetrafluoride.|$|E
