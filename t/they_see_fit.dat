He would later state that his role in eliminating the conscription in the United States was his proudest accomplishment. Friedman did, however, believe a nation could compel military training as a reserve in case of war time.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{are able}} to request Steam keys of their {{products}} to use as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>fit,</b> such as to give away in promotions, to provide to selected users for review, or to give to key resellers for different profitization. Valve generally honors all such requests, but clarified that they would evaluate some requests to avoid giving keys to games or other offerings {{that are designed to}} manipulate the Steam storefront and other features. For example, Valve said that a request for 500,000 keys for a game that has significantly negative reviews and 1,000 sales on Steam is unlikely to be granted.|$|E

50|$|The {{first model}} under the GAI is the {{negative}} income tax (NIT). Negative income tax {{works on the}} assumption that families who earn below the low-income threshold should receive aid in the form of direct grants rather than paying taxes. This allows heads of a family unit to use their financial resources as <b>they</b> best <b>sees</b> <b>fit</b> rather than being constrained by the traditional income assistance programs, which typically have means tests, time limits and other restrictions. Experiments using the negative income tax model have been completed in the United States in the late 1960s through the early 1970s.|$|R

25|$|The {{laws are}} {{generally}} {{presented as a}} set of general principles and guidelines which each individual Bahá'í must apply to their own lives as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>fit.</b> Bahá'í law and teachings do not include details on many aspects of life, and the successive heads of the religion have been reluctant to prescribe specific and detailed codes of Bahá'í behaviour; for example the heads of the religion have stated that details of Bahá'í behaviour, such as how to dress, are a matter of individual choice and not Bahá'í law. This is in contrast to the provisions of Islamic law.|$|E
25|$|However, some Japanese fans {{of hip-hop}} find it {{embarrassing}} and ridiculous that these blackface fans {{do this because}} {{they feel like they}} shouldn't change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances it {{can be seen as a}} racist act, but for many of the young the Japanese fans it is a way of immersing in the hip hop culture the way <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>fit.</b> For example, the Japanese hip hop group Soul'd Out is extremely imitative of African American culture. Looking at Soul'd Out, their appearance stands out. Their wardrobe undoubtedly reminds one of African American fashion.|$|E
25|$|Police {{power is}} {{exercised}} by the legislative and executive {{branches of the}} various states through the enactment and enforcement of laws. States {{have the power to}} compel obedience to these laws through whatever measures <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>fit,</b> provided these measures do not infringe upon any of the rights protected by the United States Constitution or in the various state constitutions, and are not unreasonably arbitrary or oppressive. Methods of enforcement can include legal sanctions, physical means, and other forms of coercion and inducement. Controversies over the exercise of state police power can arise when exercise by state authorities conflicts with individual rights and freedoms.|$|E

Created initially {{as an environmental}} initiative project, this campaign {{was developed by the}} Professional Associations of Diving Instructors (PADI) in 1989. Used to educate divers about environmental problems this program eventually grew to become a registered non-profit organization in the US in 1992 and eventually became recognized in the UK and Australia in 1999 and 2002 respectively. In spite of the arising issues with marine challenges, Project AWARE has continued to grow towards meeting the needs of the marine ecosystem as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>fit.</b> Marine debris and shark and ray conservation activism are the two most prevalent issues that are being further worked toward improving since 2011.|$|E
25|$|Academic tenure's {{original}} {{purpose was to}} guarantee the right to academic freedom: it protects teachers and researchers when they dissent from prevailing opinion, openly disagree with authorities of any sort, or spend time on unfashionable topics. Thus academic tenure {{is similar to the}} lifetime tenure that protects some judges from external pressure. Without job security, the scholarly community as a whole may experience pressure to favor noncontroversial lines of academic inquiry. The intent of tenure is to allow original ideas to be more likely to arise, by giving scholars the intellectual autonomy to investigate the problems and solutions as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>fit</b> and to report their honest conclusions. However, it has also become a type of job security for professors.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1978, {{as part of}} the Four Modernizations campaign, the Family Production Responsibility System was created, {{dismantling}} communes {{and giving}} agricultural production responsibility back to individual households. Households are now given crop quotas that they were required to provide to their collective unit in return for tools, draft animals, seeds, and other essentials. Households, which now lease land from their collectives, are free to use their farmland however <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>fit</b> as long as they meet these quotas. This freedom has given more power to individual families to meet their individual needs. In addition to these structural changes, the Chinese government also engages in irrigation projects (such as the Three Gorges Dam), runs large state farms, and encourages mechanization and fertilizer use.|$|E

25|$|Aside from Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, {{there are}} also African Americans who follow Buddhism {{and a number of}} other religions. There is a small but growing number of African Americans who {{participate}} in African traditional religions, such as West African Vodun, Santería, Ifá and diasporic traditions like the Rastafari movement. Many of them are immigrants or descendants of immigrants from the Caribbean and South America, where these are practiced. Because of religious practices, such as animal sacrifice, which are no longer common among the larger American religions, these groups may be viewed negatively and are sometimes the victims of harassment. It must be stated, however, that since the Supreme Court judgement that was given to the Lukumi Babaluaye church of Florida in 1993, there has been no major legal challenge to their right to function as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>fit.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{exercise}} {{of the right to}} free assembly is restricted by the common law as well as legislation. There is a common law duty to protect the Queen's peace and the power to detain persons who commit breach of the peace. The Public Order Act 1986 provides for the offences of riot, violent disorder, affray and causing harassment, alarm or distress, all of which may be committed by participants in an assembly. In addition, the Public Order Act 1936 outlaws the wearing of political uniforms at a public meeting when they suggest an association with a political object. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 gives the police powers in relation to trespassers on private land. There is now a requirement under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 to notify the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis of an intention to demonstrate in Parliament Square and the Commissioner may impose such conditions as <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>fit,</b> including the place, time and number of participants.|$|E
25|$|The {{guidance}} {{received a}} mixed reception. It was welcomed by {{an editorial in}} the British Medical Journal but the Royal College of Psychiatrists launched an unsuccessful appeal. The NICE guidance, as the British Medical Journal editorial points out, is only a policy statement and psychiatrists may deviate from it if <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>fit.</b> Adherence to standards has not been universal in the past. A survey of ECT use in 1980 found {{that more than half of}} ECT clinics failed to meet minimum standards set by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, with a later survey in 1998 finding that minimum standards were largely adhered to, but that two-thirds of clinics still fell short of current guidelines, particularly in the training and supervision of junior doctors involved in the procedure. A voluntary accreditation scheme, ECTAS, was set up in 2004 by the Royal College, but as of 2006 only a minority of ECT clinics in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have signed up.|$|E
