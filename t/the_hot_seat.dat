25|$|Following {{promotion}} to the Premier League, QPR endured a difficult 2014–2015 campaign. Their initial manager, Harry Redknapp, resigned in February after poor results and mutual {{frustration with the}} board. He was replaced by Chris Ramsey. The team finished the season last, amassing only 30 points, and were relegated back to the Championship after only one season.

25|$|To {{promote the}} 2001 movie Moulin Rouge!, he {{appeared}} on a celebrity edition of the US version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? with Kelly Ripa, Kevin Sorbo, Alfre Woodard, Martin Short and Chevy Chase. Appearing as the first celebrity to sit in <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>seat,</b> he eventually tried for $125,000, but got the answer wrong. Later in 2002, on the syndicated version, {{a question about the}} movie featured his character and Meredith Vieira mentioned that Leguizamo had played Lautrec and had been on the show.|$|E

25|$|Lyall was {{replaced}} by Lou Macari for the 1989–90 season, but Macari resigned after less than one season as manager to concentrate on clearing his name in connection with financial irregularities at his previous club, Swindon Town. The next manager to occupy <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> at West Ham was Billy Bonds, who guided them to seventh place in 1989–90 (just missing out on the playoffs) but in 1990–91, they attained runners-up spot in the Second Division {{and returned to the}} First Division. But West Ham struggled throughout the 1991–92 season and were relegated in bottom place, missing the first season of the new Premier League.|$|E
25|$|When the U.S. Millionaires {{syndicated}} version {{debuted in}} 2002, Fastest Finger was eliminated for the reduced episode length (30 minutes {{as opposed to}} the previous network version's length of 60 minutes). Thus, contestants immediately take <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Seat,</b> each of them called in after their predecessors' games end. Contestants are required to pass a more conventional game show qualification test at auditions; however, when the U.S. Millionaire revived its primetime version for specials, it also restored the Fastest Finger round; this was done in 2004 for the Super Millionaire series which raised the top prize to $10,000,000 and in August 2009 for an eleven-night special that celebrated the U.S. version's tenth anniversary. Long after the U.S. version eliminated its Fastest Finger round, numerous other versions (including the Australian, Italian, Turkish, British, Russian, Dutch and French versions) followed suit by eliminating their respective Fastest Finger First rounds; additionally, some versions (such as the British, Dutch, French and Russian versions) have eliminated their respective Fastest Finger First rounds for special events wherein celebrities play for charity.|$|E
25|$|When the U.S. Millionaire {{introduced}} its shuffle format, the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were {{replaced with a}} single podium and as a result, the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able {{to walk around the}} stage. According to Vieira, <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Seat</b> was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer. Also, two video screens were installed–one that displays the current question in play, and another that displays the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernised look and feel, in order {{to take into account the}} show's transition to high-definition broadcasting, which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and light-emitting diode (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colours and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.|$|E

25|$|For the {{beginning}} of the 1935–36 season, the Blackpool board appointed former Reading manager Joe Smith to <b>the</b> Bloomfield Road <b>hot</b> <b>seat,</b> a seat he would occupy for the next 23 years.|$|R
50|$|Stan Ternent {{replaced}} Bob Stokoe in <b>the</b> Blackpool <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> during <b>the</b> close season, and in {{the following}} 1979-80 campaign, Weston made 35 league appearances and scored three goals. Alan Ball succeeded Ternent {{two-thirds of the way}} through the season, making it six managers Weston had played under in five years at the club.|$|R
500|$|The format in the Play It! {{attraction}} {{was very}} {{similar to that of the}} television show that inspired it. When a show started, a [...] "Fastest Finger" [...] question was given, and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Seat</b> for that show. However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, the questions were set to time limits, and the Phone-a-Friend lifeline became Phone a Complete Stranger which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction's theater who would find a guest to help. After the contestant's game was over, they were awarded anything from a collectible pin, to clothing, to a Millionaire CD game, to a 3-night Disney Cruise.|$|E
500|$|Unlike older {{game shows}} whose sets are or were {{designed}} to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, Millionaires set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the program feels more like a movie thriller than a typical quiz show. The floor is made of Plexiglas beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper. Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010, the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs {{in the center of}} the stage, known as [...] "Hot Seats"; these measured [...] high, were modeled after chairs typically found in hair salons, and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other pertinent information. Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to Millionaire, Vieira stated in an interview with her Millionaire predecessor on his morning talk show that <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Seat</b> was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.|$|E
2500|$|Maxwell {{was picked}} in the Australian A side to play South Africa, {{replacing}} an injured Jon Holland. Selector John Inverarity {{said when he}} spoke to Maxwell he [...] "said 'you're the spinner, you're in <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>seat,</b> get on with it', and we hope he responds to that sort of challenge. Glenn is a player of particular interest, a player of great skill and exuberance and enthusiasm. We want him as an allrounder, so we're very keen for him to get opportunity with his spin bowling, and we're putting him in <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> here." [...] Maxwell scored 64 and took 2-70.|$|E
50|$|An {{abbreviated}} {{format of}} <b>the</b> show, Millionaire <b>Hot</b> <b>Seat</b> began production in 2009. Like the original Millionaire, it is hosted by Eddie McGuire. Airing daily at 5:30pm, {{it is currently}} in its seventh season.|$|R
50|$|A {{few days}} after his {{departure}} from Bełchatów, he was signed by Cracovia Kraków, taking <b>the</b> club's <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> after Orest Lenczyk. The first months with the new team were far from successful, as Cracovia earned only 4 points in 9 games and occupied the last position in the league's table. On 24 October 2010, Ulatowski resigned from his position.|$|R

2500|$|Contestants {{are given}} a series of lifelines to aid them with {{difficult}} questions. After using a lifeline, the contestant can either answer the question, use another lifeline, or walk away and keep the money (although using the [...] "Double Dip" [...] lifeline requires the contestant to immediately answer and using the [...] "Jump the Question" [...] lifeline naturally prevents them from continuing with that question). Except {{for the first three}} seasons of the [...] "Jump the Question" [...] lifeline's use, each lifeline can only be used once. In <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Seat</b> format, the concept of lifelines is discarded in favor of the option to pass.|$|E
2500|$|The {{matter of}} Costa Rica placed Pallister on <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> {{just days before}} the Manitoba general {{election}} 2016. On April 16, and at the request of Canadian news media outlets, The Costa Rica Star published the results of an investigation into the assets owned by Pallister in Costa Rica, which include three pieces of real estate in the upscale coastal town of Tamarindo Beach. A spokesperson for Pallister's party denied the public records investigation conducted by The Costa Rica Star, which prompted rival candidate Dave Chomiak of the New Democratic Party to call on Pallister to tell the truth about his travels and his business interests in Costa Rica.|$|E

50|$|Liam Buckley {{was persuaded}} {{back into the}} club to take <b>the</b> {{managerial}} <b>hot</b> <b>seat.</b> Buckley would lead the Saints to a second straight league title and Dolan continued to work effectively as managing director.

2500|$|Patti LuPone, who {{initially}} {{had been promised}} the Broadway run, sued Lloyd Webber and received a settlement reported to be $1 million. Frank Rich, in his book <b>The</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Seat,</b> noted that these lawsuits contributed to Sunset Boulevard setting {{the record for the}} most money lost by a theatrical endeavour {{in the history of the}} United States. [...] According to The New York Times, operating costs soared far beyond the budget, and the [...] "Broadway production has earned back, at best, 80% of the initial $13 million". [...] For example, during the week of 2 July 1995, [...] "it cost $731,304 to run Sunset Boulevard, including... advertising fees of $138,352 (which had been budgeted at $40,000 a week)." [...] The road companies also generated large financial losses. [...] Rich puts the final figure near or above US$20 million lost, making the show what he termed a [...] "flop-hit," [...] as it ran more than two years. The musical sold over a million tickets on Broadway.|$|E
2500|$|Danish {{mountain}} biker Annika Langvad, {{who finished}} 6th in the end, was the early leader after setting {{a time of}} 28' 27" [...] and stayed in <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> for a long time. German Trixi Worrack, {{the first of the}} final 10 riders to finish, took over the lead after finishing in a time of 28' 19". The main favourites started last and showed some fast intermediate times at the two intermediate time points after [...] and [...] The Dutch Ellen van Dijk was the fastest from the start by riding 20 second faster than Linda Villumsen and 24 seconds faster than Carmen Small at the first time point. At the second split the gaps were 25 and 28 seconds respectively. Van Dijk lost one second to Villumsen in the final five kilometres but her margin was large enough to win her second world title of the championship after winning the team time trial with her [...] squad on Sunday. For Villumsen it was her fifth consecutive time on the world championship time trial podium, but never won the rainbow jersey.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Chiefs {{loss to the}} New York Jets in the 2007 season finale, {{general manager}} Carl Peterson {{announced}} that both he and head coach Herman Edwards {{would return to the}} Chiefs in 2008. However, team chairman Clark Hunt—who took over leadership of the Chiefs in late 2006 {{after the death of his}} father, team founder Lamar Hunt—declined to immediately comment on Peterson's status. Hunt spoke out weeks later and stated that the Chiefs were his [...] "No. 1 priority" [...] and that [...] "to have the best chance of success in 2008, having Carl here makes a lot of sense.” Hunt wanted to avoid having a new general manager come in with a new head coach, and starting from scratch again. Edwards and Peterson were considered to be on <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> by the press, but inside the team, both were considered to be safe unless absolutely zero progress was made in 2008. Clark Hunt had expressed his expectations of a winning Chiefs team earning a playoff berth in 2008.|$|E
50|$|The club's relegation {{prompted}} the Blackpool board {{to install a}} recognised manager, and they opted for Sandy MacFarlane. MacFarlane occupied <b>the</b> Bloomfield Road <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> for just two seasons, in which the club finished 11th and 4th. MacFarlane's final season, 1934-35, marked Jimmy Hampson's eighth successive (and final) season as Blackpool's top League goalscorer.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>Seat,</b> in turn, {{became known}} for its provocative guest {{appearance}}s. A 1983 appearance by Blase Bonpane ended when Bonpane overturned George's desk {{and walked out of}} the studio. When similar incidents occurred on later talk shows, such as those hosted by Geraldo Rivera and Jerry Springer, George called them [...] "copycat combat."

50|$|Oates' strike-rate {{dried up}} in 1965-66, {{with only one}} goal in 21 league appearances, {{and in the first}} two-thirds of the 1966-67 campaign, Ron Suart gave Oates only three starts. Stan Mortensen {{replaced}} Suart in <b>the</b> Blackpool <b>hot</b> <b>seat</b> in <b>the</b> New Year, and the former Blackpool striker provided more opportunities in the team. Oates scored in the final league game of the season, a 3-1 victory against Liverpool at Anfield on 13 May 1967. Blackpool, however, had already been relegated to Division Two at that point.|$|R
