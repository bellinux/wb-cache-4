5000|$|Prior to the game's launch, {{a season}} pass was {{announced}} {{which would include}} all future downloadable content for the game. On 13 January 2015, four downloadable content packs were released, three of which contained in-game items and character skins based on Tomb Raider: Legend, and the Deus Ex and Hitman franchises. [...] These themed packs were previously available as bonuses for pre-ordering the game from specific retailers. [...] The fourth content pack, titled Icy Death, added various in-game items, a tomb featuring new puzzles and enemies, and a Lara Croft character skin based on the 2013 Tomb Raider video game. [...] On 2 February 2015, the <b>Twisted</b> <b>Gears</b> downloadable pack was released featuring a tomb, new in-game items, and a Lara Croft character skin based on the original Tomb Raider game.|$|R
5000|$|Vespa T5 Mk1 Cosmetically, the Vespa T5 Mk1 {{featured}} a rectangular head light, an updated headset console {{which included a}} fuel level indicator and a digital or analog tachometer (depending on market), a flat rear end (achieved by adding the [...] "square tail" [...] sheet to a PX body), and a redesigned seat to complete the look. The scooter had a classic 4 speed manual left hand <b>twist</b> grip <b>gear</b> change, a kick starter, and a front storage compartment with a black tray atop it, adorned with a [...] "Pole Position", logo, designed to underline its sportiness.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the success}} of [...] "Kiss My Trance" [...] in 2008, The Subs started to tour with live shows. They soon {{established}} a solid stage reputation, as energetic live performances and a raw punk attitude became their trademark. Frontman Papillon’s movement on stage {{is often referred to}} as that of a mad professor, because of the combination of knob <b>twisting</b> the hi-tech <b>gear</b> and sometimes-crazy climbing habits and risky stage dives.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} design of 1884 used a belt drive, and twist {{grip on the}} handlebars which applied the brake when turned one way and tensioned the drive belt, applying power to the wheel, when turned the other way. Roper's velocipede of the late 1860s used a similar two way twistgrip handlebar control. The plans also called for steering linkage shafts that made two right angle bends connected with gears, but the actual working model used a simple handlebar without the <b>twist</b> grip or <b>gear</b> linkage. [...] The design was patented on August 29, 1885.|$|R
40|$|A {{planetary}} gear system includes a sun gear coupled to an annular ring gear through a plurality of twist-planet gears, a speeder gear, and a ground structure having an internal ring gear. Each planet gear includes a solid gear having a first half portion {{in the form of}} a spur gear which includes vertical gear teeth and a second half portion {{in the form of a}} spur gear which includes helical gear teeth that are offset from the vertical gear teeth and which contact helical gear teeth on the speeder gear and helical gear teeth on the outer ring gear. One half of the <b>twist</b> planet <b>gears</b> are preloaded downward, while the other half are preloaded upwards, each one alternating with the other so that each one twists in a motion opposite to its neighbor when rotated until each planet gear seats against the sun gear, the outer ring gear, the speeder gear, and the inner ring gear. The resulting configuration is an improved stiff anti-backlash gear system...|$|R
500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} in-game voice acting. [...] G4TV's Matt Kell noted that Peter Cullen's voice work as Optimus was [...] "commanding and familiar", {{adding that the}} other actors [...] "even {{do their best to}} {{replicate}} the voices of the original cartoon." [...] Mike Nelson of Game Informer agreed and noted the game's excellent dialogue, stating [...] "the script has all the overwrought melodrama you’d expect from giant talking robots." [...] Several critics also gave high marks for War for Cybertrons multiplayer. [...] IGN's Arthur Gies noted the influences from Unreal Championship, Tribes, Team Fortress 2, and [...] adding that [...] "War for Cybertron leverages its transformation mechanic to create something that feels shockingly new." [...] Tom McShea of GameSpot noted that the game's Escalation mode provided a Transformers <b>twist</b> on <b>Gears</b> of Wars Horde mode. [...] GamePros Kat Bailey noted that the multiplayer was [...] "probably the most appealing part of the package", adding it had a [...] "strong suite [...] options." [...] 1UP.com's Matt Miller lauded the ability to play through the game's campaign with up to three players online, as did G4TV's Matt Kell. [...] Both reviewers also praised the new character designs, with Kell calling them [...] "inventive." [...] Wired.com's John Mix Meyer gave praise to the game's campaign length, stating [...] "The game’s 10-hour single-player campaign means there’s plenty of time for the crazy transformations to strut their stuff." [...] John Hamblin of Eurogamer praised the transformation animations. [...] He stated players will [...] "occasionally wish there was a Max Payne slow-mo option so you could appreciate the nuance of these feats a little more." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2009, Wired {{included}} {{the game in}} its list of [...] "The 15 Most Influential Games of the Decade" [...] at #13, concluding that every [...] "videogame story that subverts a player’s expectations owes a debt to the ground broken by Metal Gear Solid 2." [...] The artistic influence of Metal Gear Solid 2 {{can be seen in}} later video games such as Goichi Suda's similarly postmodern game Killer7, the similarly metanarrative game Portal, the survival horror title , and particularly the first-person shooter BioShock, which featured a similar plot <b>twist</b> to Metal <b>Gear</b> Solid 2. Several game mechanics developed in Metal Gear Solid 2, such as the cover system and laser sight mechanic, have since become staples of stealth games as well as shooters, including Kill Switch (2003), Resident Evil 4 (2005) and Gears of War (2006). According to Kojima, Metal Gear Solid 2 paid more [...] "attention to the surroundings" [...] in real-time and later [...] "games like Call of Duty have followed this trend of making your surroundings more realistic." ...|$|R
