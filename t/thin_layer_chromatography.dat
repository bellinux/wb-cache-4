5|$|Several {{relatively}} simple chemical tests — commercially available as reagent testing kits — {{can be used}} to assess the presence of psilocybin in extracts prepared from mushrooms. The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color, and a green color in the Mandelin test. Neither of these tests, however, is specific for psilocybin; for example, the Marquis test will react with many classes of controlled drugs, such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings, including amphetamine and methamphetamine. Ehrlich's reagent and DMACA reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>chromatography.</b> Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples. Although the earliest methods commonly used gas chromatography, the high temperature required to vaporize the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs. In forensic toxicology, techniques involving gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures. These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used with ultraviolet, fluorescence, electrochemical, and electrospray mass spectrometric detection methods.|$|E

25|$|<b>Thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>chromatography</b> (TLC) is {{a widely}} {{employed}} laboratory technique used to separate different biochemicals {{on the basis of}} their size and is similar to paper chromatography. However, instead of using a stationary phase of paper, it involves a stationary phase of a thin layer of adsorbent like silica gel, alumina, or cellulose on a flat, inert substrate. TLC is very versatile; multiple samples can be separated simultaneously on the same layer, making it very useful for screening applications such as testing drug levels and water purity. Possibility of cross-contamination is low since each separation is performed on a new layer. Compared to paper, it has the advantage of faster runs, better separations, better quantitative analysis, and the choice between different adsorbents. For even better resolution and faster separation that utilizes less solvent, high-performance TLC can be used. An older popular use had been to differentiate chromosomes by observing distance in gel (separation of was a separate step).|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Lichens are {{symbiotic}} {{associations of}} a fungus with green alga or cyanobacteria. Their secondary metabolites {{are produced by}} the mycobiont, and accumulate as extracellular tiny crystals on the outer surfaces of the hyphae. Th metabolites have unique biological activities such as antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antiprotozoal, anti-proliferative, anti-tumor, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory.   Materials and methods: Protoparmeliopsis muralis was collected from KaneGonbad mountains in Ilam province and identified by using chemical tests and survey of the anatomical characters. Then TLC and HPLC were carried. The excision wound (5 cm long and 2 mm deep) was created on skin. Then wounds were infected with Staphylococcus aureus by sterile swab. Rats were randomly placed into three groups: 1 - control group, 2 - treated group with 5 percent ointment of methanolic extract of P. muralis, and 3 - treated group with 10 percent ointment of the extract. Finally an amount of wound healing were measured on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11.   Results: By using <b>Thin</b> <b>layers</b> <b>Chromatography</b> and High Performance Liquid Chromatography, the existence of psoromic acid, usnic acid, zeorin and fumarprotocetraric acids were confirmed.

25|$|Before {{techniques}} of molecular biology {{were used to}} localize indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT), characterization and localization went on a par: samples of the biological material where INMT is hypothesized to be active are subject to enzyme assay. Those enzyme assays are performed either with a radiolabeled methyl donor like (14C-CH3)SAM to which known amounts of unlabeled substrates like tryptamine are added or with addition of a radiolabeled substrate like (14C)NMT to demonstrate in vivo formation. As qualitative determination of the radioactively tagged product of the enzymatic reaction is sufficient to characterize INMT existence and activity (or lack of), analytical methods used in INMT assays {{are not required to}} be as sensitive as those needed to directly detect and quantify the minute amounts of endogenously formed DMT (see DMT subsection below). The essentially qualitative method <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> <b>chromatography</b> (TLC) was thus used in a vast majority of studies.
