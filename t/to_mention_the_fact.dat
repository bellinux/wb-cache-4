25|$|The {{next book}} in HarperCollins' four book series, Emily the Strange: Stranger and Stranger, was {{released}} in March 2010. In this book Emily is back in Blandindulle and preparing {{to move to a}} new town. While experimenting with her supply of Black rock and duplicating device she accidentally clones herself. Enjoying the benefit of a second Emily at first, the real Emily comes across problems such as identity crisis and loss of some of her unique talents. Not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that her clone thinks she's the real Emily and evidently plans to end Emily Strange for good.|$|E
500|$|Bronstein {{felt that}} Fischer [...] "had {{the right to}} play the match with Karpov on his own conditions". Korchnoi stated:Was Fischer right in {{demanding}} that the world title be protected by a two point handicap – that the challenger would be considered the winner with a 10–8 score and that the champion would retain his title {{in the event of}} a 9–9 draw? Yes, this was quite natural: the champion deserves this, not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that further play to the first win {{in the event of a}}n even score would be nothing short of a lottery – the winner in that case could not claim to have won a convincing victory.|$|E
2500|$|Yael Kahn, {{chair of}} the UK-based Islington Friends of Yibna said that while she pleased to see openly {{criticism}} of Israeli policies, she {{also found that the}} petition was [...] "wholly inappropriate, due to its failure <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that these settlements are illegal. I am utterly appalled by the failure of the petition to mention Gaza and the barbaric siege Israel imposes on the 1.5 million Palestinians living there. It is outrageous to not speak out against the Israeli restrictions on the amount of food Palestinians in Gaza are allowed to have." ...|$|E

40|$|A person {{familiar}} with the Star Wars trilogy and currently hooked to the remake of „Battleship Galactica“ may feel curiously attracted {{and at the same}} time puzzled when entering one of the grandiose baroque interiors, many of which can be found in Bavaria, Austria and Hungary, whose ceilings are decorated with elaborate celestial landscapes. The sheer exuberance of the visual display of imaginary cosmic interaction has no match in contemporary architecture, but it may well be regarded as akin to recent science fiction scenarios, not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of real life digital warfare. As far as iconographic conventions are concerned, Jupiter and Superman are reasonably close relatives. Yet, on the other hand, centuries divide those exquisite showcases of church and nobility from pop culture...|$|R
50|$|Noteworthy <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Workbench was {{the only}} window manager that {{eventually}} inspired an entire family of descendant and successors: Ambient in MorphOS, Zune/Wanderer in AROS, Workbench NG (New Generation in AmigaOS 4.0 and 4.1). Workbench 4.1 was enhanced by 2D vector interface powered by Cairo libraries, and presenting a modern Porter-Duff 3D based Compositing Engine.|$|R
2500|$|Shaun Williamson {{frequently}} plays {{himself in}} Ricky Gervais's Extras, {{where he is}} referred to at all times as [...] "Barry from EastEnders". Derek Martin (Charlie Slater) appeared in episode three in the third series of Little Britain in 2005. The sketch primarily focused around the character Marjorie Dawes telling her Fat Fighters group not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Martin is in EastEnders, then mentioning it herself. In the Comic Relief special of Little Britain, the character Dennis Waterman refers to his [...] "daughter - the one in EastEnders". This is {{a reference to the}} real actor Dennis Waterman, who is the father of Hannah Waterman, who played Laura Beale in the show.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the film}} and the play take {{dramatic}} license with the on-air and behind-the-scene details of The Nixon Interviews. [...] Jonathan Aitken, one of Nixon's official biographers who spent much time with the former president at La Casa Pacifica, rebukes the film for its portrayal of a drunken Nixon making a late-night phone call as never having happened and says it is [...] "from start to finish, an artistic invention by the scriptwriter Peter Morgan." [...] Director Ron Howard discussed the scene in detail on his feature commentary for the DVD release, pointing out it was a deliberate act of dramatic license, and while Frost never received such a phone call, [...] "it was known that Richard Nixon, during ...the Watergate scandal, had occasionally made midnight phone calls that he couldn't very well recall the following day." [...] Aitken recalls that [...] "Frost did not ambush Nixon during the final interview into a damaging admission of guilt. What the former president 'confessed' about Watergate was carefully pre-planned. It was only with considerable help and advice from his adversary's team that Frost managed to get much more out of Nixon, in the closing sequences, by reining in his fierce attitude and adopting a gentler approach." [...] Elizabeth Drew of the Huffington Post and author of Richard M. Nixon (2007) noted some inaccuracies, including a misrepresentation {{of the end of}} the interviews, the failure <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Nixon received 20% of the profits from the interviews, and what she says are inaccurate representations of some of the characters. Drew points out a critical line in the movie that is particularly deceptive: Nixon admitted he [...] "'...was involved in a 'cover-up,' as you call it.' The ellipsis is of course unknown to the audience, and is crucial: What Nixon actually said was, 'You're wanting me to say that I participated in an illegal cover-up. No!'" ...|$|E

50|$|It's worthy <b>to</b> record <b>mention</b> of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that while}} <b>the</b> above fig. gives an example or 4-aza steroids, 6-aza steroids {{have also been}} {{developed}} by GSK (cf. 5-alpha-reductase_inhibitor), although none of these compounds, as yet, are available for sale commercially.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's interesting, exceedingly," [...] he said. [...] "Still, I don't think I'd {{recommend}} {{you to tell}} it in quite that shape to everybody. It would probably make trouble, and you mightn't find anybody very willing to believe you. Things of that kind don't happen now--at least, they're not supposed to--and I fancy it would prove {{a good deal more}} convenient just <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> simple <b>facts.</b> You bought <b>the</b> steamer stranded, and, with considerable difficulty, got her off." ...|$|R
40|$|After reading Professor Bohr's {{address at}} the British Association last September in which he {{tentatively}} suggested the name "yucon" for the newly discovered particle, I wrote <b>to</b> him incidentally <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> than Anderson and Neddermeyer had suggested the name "mesotron" (intermediate particle) as the most appropriate name. ...|$|R

5000|$|Lieutenant Colonel Wetzel was {{deployed}} to Vietnam in 1968 as the Battalion Commander of the 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment (United States), the [...] "Polar Bears". At one point, after an enemy bullet struck him, he declined a Purple Heart {{for which he}} could have easily and successfully applied. He judged the wound too insignificant <b>to</b> <b>mention,</b> despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it {{left him with a}} permanent scar. Wetzel went on to lead his battalion in a successful textbook military battle to secure an important mountainous area.|$|R
40|$|Researches {{conducted}} at the Faculty of Construction in Jassy showed several factors that may help finding technical solutions which will make possible to economically apply acceleration procedures of concrete hardening by thermal treatment with solar energy. It has <b>to</b> be <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> thermal treatment do not exclude, but {{it is based on}} the acceleration methods of concrete hardening through composition with or without the usage of different additives [...] plasticizer type (to reduce the quantity of water from the concrete) and accelerators for cement binding or hardening. These methods also take into account the climate where the process of hardening takes place...|$|R
60|$|I {{have put}} this in here lest I forget <b>to</b> make <b>mention</b> of <b>the</b> <b>fact,</b> that in what the Britishers set down as a victory they lost twice and a half as many men as we, and all that had been gained by this outpouring of blood were the hastily {{constructed}} works which we had thrown up on Breed's hill.|$|R
6000|$|... "In Scotland, I believe, sir," [...] the man replied. [...] "I called round this afternoon, {{although}} I {{was careful}} not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that you were in}} town. The house is practically in the hands of caretakers." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{seemed to}} look at me a moment as for the tip of the ear of irony. “You doubtless think I exaggerate, and you force me {{therefore}} <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that I speak of such matters with a certain intelligence.” ...|$|E
60|$|Leger {{remembered that}} she had once professed herself {{perfectly}} contented with the Green River country, {{but he did not}} think it advisable <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact.</b> He rose and flung an armful of wood upon the fire, and then stood still smiling.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{it is not}} brave," [...] said Lydgate, [...] "but if a man {{is afraid}} of {{creeping}} paralysis?" [...] Then, in another tone, [...] "Yet {{you have made a}} great difference in my courage by believing in me. Everything seems more bearable since I have talked to you; and if you can clear me in a few other minds, especially in Farebrother's, I shall be deeply grateful. The point I wish you not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of disobedience to my orders. That would soon get distorted. After all, there is no evidence for me but people's opinion of me beforehand. You can only repeat my own report of myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{tell me how}} {{it happens}} that {{you are on the}} Patuxent river taking prisoners here and there without due warrant from the {{government}} at Washington," [...] the commodore said with a smile, and I began by explaining why we started in search of the fleet, not forgetting <b>to</b> make <b>mention</b> of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that we had hoped to find a sale for fish or oysters.|$|R
5000|$|Johnny Lynn Old Chief {{was arrested}} after a [...] "fracas" [...] {{involving}} [...] "at least one gunshot." [...] He was eventually charged with {{assault with a}} dangerous weapon, using a firearm {{in relation to a}} crime of violence, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. At trial, he asked the court to order the prosecution <b>to</b> refrain from <b>mentioning</b> any <b>fact</b> surrounding <b>the</b> prior felony that made him a prohibited possessor of a firearm. He also offered to stipulate to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he had suffered a prior conviction that made him a prohibited possessor. The reason for asking <b>the</b> prosecution not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of <b>the</b> prior crime, he said, was to preserve his right to be convicted by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt on the basis of <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> relating to only the conduct with which he was currently charged. In light of the stipulation, he contended that introducing any evidence relating to <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of his prior crimes would be unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The prosecutor refused to agree to Old Chief's stipulation, arguing that he had the right to prove his case his own way. The district court sided with the prosecutor, resulting in the admission of evidence at trial that Old Chief had previously been convicted of [...] "knowingly and unlawfully assaulting Rory Dean Fenner, said assault resulting in serious bodily injury." [...] Old Chief was convicted on all the federal counts against him.|$|R
6000|$|Both Peter and Jumper {{opened their}} eyes very wide with surprise.

Why don't you, Jumper?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Miriam {{gives birth}} to Abigail, but dies shortly afterwards, her last sight being of Abigail's [...] "yellow eyes"; {{supposedly}} her ghost can be heard screaming on the stairs in July ever after. The seven horsemen arrive at the mansion and discover the baby Abigail in the sarcophagus, eating something too horrifying for <b>the</b> narrator <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> (though <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it {{is found in the}} sarcophagus suggests that Abigail is eating her own previous body). Appalled, they take her away to bury her in a hidden chapel in the forest with seven silver spikes driven through her body (a burial heard as the intro to the album), in the hope that this will prevent a further resurrection.|$|R
30|$|The most {{important}} feature of the samples is the authenticity of presented emotional states, which narrows the search area. The authors focus mainly on the materials from live shows and programs such as reality show. The reactions and feelings presented by the participants of such programs seem spontaneous and provoked by events and discussions. For example, shows presenting political and social problems (e.g., Państwo w Państwie by Polsat TV) contain {{a large number of}} anger displays. The assumption of authenticity of emotions could be false and is associated with the subjective evaluation performed by the authors and volunteers involved in the labeling process. What is important <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> collected recordings often contain background noise, which also might have affected the assessment.|$|R
5000|$|The {{story begins}} with a wanted poster for a weasel with the {{subtitle}} [...] "WEASEL (CHICKEN THIEF)." [...] The Dawg is seen guarding the hen house by marching back and forth. Foghorn, {{who is on the}} other side of the wire fence, states to the audience that the Dawg is [...] "strictly G.I.", meaning [...] "Gibbering Idiot," [...] not <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact,</b> he's being stubborn. Foghorn distracts the Dawg by deliberately letting a young chick escape from the barnyard. As the dog chases the chick around, Foghorn allows a second chick to escape. Then, as the Dawg gives chase, Foghorn props himself on the wire fence and lifts his feet, allowing all of the chicks to run free. As the Dawg realizes he's being tricked, he shouts at Foghorn to [...] "Hey, cut that out!" [...] and collects all of the chicks, even using his tail to scoop up a dropped one when the weasel appears. The Dawg, in order to open the gate to the barnyard, inadvertently asks the weasel to hold on to the chicks. Realizing he just spoke to the weasel, he lifts it up, deposits the chicks back in the yard, and then kicks the weasel away, causing it to yelp repeatedly. Foghorn continues to mock the Dawg by removing a knot and then push a chick through a knothole in the fence.|$|R

60|$|When Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase, {{every one}} {{told him he}} was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no doubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville himself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his duty <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.|$|E
30|$|Finally, it is {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> that, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that in real applications the obstacles usually have a non-constant velocity, our algorithm was optimized to be executed in a fast fashion. In each control loop the algorithm is recalculated and the unpredictability of the obstacle detection is smoothened. Usually, the errors in the obstacle’s position and velocity estimations decrease abruptly when the obstacle approaches the robot, and therefore for the important obstacles (the ones near the robot) the uncertainty is not high.|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this article is to {{highlight}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that there are some drawbacks in the existing definition of complementation of fuzzy sets and hence the geometrical representation of fuzzy sets on the basis of such definition which itself is defective would have no meaning. As a result the theorems or formulas which were rooted in the geometrical representation would become unacceptable and it is realized that in most cases of practical significance it is desirable to consider an additional requirement in defining fuzzy complement. It is important <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> here <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that all these existing properties are being seen through the application of complementation of fuzzy sets which is rooted in the reference function. The current definition of complementation would infact remove those drawbacks and cosequently produce the results which seems to be logical...|$|R
50|$|The Enabling Act was {{effectively}} {{a constitutional amendment}} because of the foregoing alterations to the normal legislative process. The act met the constitutional requirements (two-thirds of the Reichstag's members were present, and two-thirds of the members present {{voted in favor of}} the measure). The Act did not explicitly amend the Weimar Constitution, but there was explicit <b>mention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> procedure sufficient for constitutional reform was followed. The constitution of 1919 was never formally repealed, but the Enabling Act meant that all its other provisions were a dead letter.|$|R
