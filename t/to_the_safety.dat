5|$|An {{advocate}} {{for small businesses}} and agricultural interests, Cooper opposed an April 1965 bill that expanded {{the powers of the}} Federal Trade Commission to regulate cigarette advertising. In March 1966, he proposed an amendment to a mine safety bill supported by the United Mine Workers of America that would have nullified provisions of the bill if they were not shown to contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> of small mines, but his amendment was defeated.|$|E

5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from {{which there is no}} direct, purely vertical ascent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E

5|$|Encouraged by Nogai, in 1292 Shishman {{launched}} a major campaign against Milutin, his Serbian neighbour to the west. Thanks {{to the support}} of Tatar mercenaries, Shishman's forces raided deeply into Serbian territory and reached Hvosno in Kosovo. After attempting to conquer the fortress of Ždrelo near Peć to no avail and burning the Žiča monastery, Shishman's troops returned to Vidin without any territorial gains. Milutin's response to Shishman's act of aggression was much more successful. His counter-attack resulted in Serbian forces reaching Vidin and capturing Shishman's capital after a brief siege. The despot, however, managed to escape north of the Danube <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> of his Tatar suzerains.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{integration}} of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) in today's society {{depends on the}} ability of their operators to demonstrate safety. RPAS operators use risk matrices, as required by <b>the</b> Dutch government, <b>to</b> indicate <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> level. Key issues with this approach include the lack of available component reliability data for determining the risk factors, and the exclusion of human interactions. This study aims <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> competence of the Systematic Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) <b>to</b> demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> of RPAS operations. It is concluded that the STPA is a comprehensive method <b>to</b> demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> of RPAS operations...|$|R

5|$|For most of Edward's reign, Mary {{remained}} {{on her own}} estates and rarely attended court. A plan between May and July 1550 to smuggle her out of England <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> of the European mainland came to nothing. Religious differences between Mary and Edward continued. When Mary was in her thirties, she attended a reunion with Edward and Elizabeth for Christmas 1550, where 13-year-old Edward embarrassed Mary, and reduced both her and himself to tears {{in front of the}} court, by publicly reproving her for ignoring his laws regarding worship. Mary repeatedly refused Edward's demands that she abandon Catholicism, and Edward persistently refused to drop his demands.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{responded to}} the French and Angevin threat by {{expanding}} his own network of supporters beyond the Norman borders. Some Norman barons deemed unreliable were arrested or dispossessed, and Henry used their forfeited estates to bribe his potential allies in the neighbouring territories, in particular Maine. Around 1110, Henry attempted to arrest the young William Clito, but William's mentors moved him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> of Flanders before he could be taken. At about this time, Henry probably began to style himself as the Duke of Normandy. Robert of Bellême turned against Henry once again, and when he appeared at Henry's court in 1112 in a new role as a French ambassador, {{he was arrested and}} imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Moxon and Carla Smith had a daughter, Stacy Grove Meyer. Meyer died on June 25, 2000 {{after she}} {{fell off a}} ladder and was {{electrocuted}} after touching a 7,200-volt wire while working at Golden Era Productions. Golden Era Productions was cited by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health for improper wiring precautions near a vault where Grove Meyer had been working. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigated the incident, and determined that her death was not related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> violations at the facility. Grove Meyer had worked for two years at Golden Era Productions in landscaping and maintenance.|$|E

5|$|L.F. Wade International Airport {{sustained}} some {{roof and}} runway lighting damage, and the Bermuda Weather Service building lost a storm shutter and saw water forced inside a communications room. A restaurant {{at the site}} of the Gibbs Hill Lighthouse was severely damaged, requiring a complete roof replacement. The Causeway was largely spared, with some damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> walls alongside the road, and it was partially reopened on October 18 after initial repairs. However, one of two lanes remained shut down for several days. Many boats were washed ashore and damaged or wrecked by the storm, and other vessels tipped over in boatyards. According to preliminary estimates, properties in the Dockyard alone incurred US$1 million (2014 BMD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|Later, in Walter Skinner's (Mitch Pileggi) office, Mulder {{begins to}} doubt once more {{that they are}} free at all, asking Scully to name any sort of drug that causes its effects to halt once users know they are hallucinating.

Once again, their surroundings melt away as they awaken underground again in the cave. Mulder sticks his hand through the earth ceiling as Skinner {{and a team of}} rescue staff manage to locate them and drag them out and haul them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> of an ambulance.

5|$|Leaving 12,000 {{troops to}} guard Mannheim, Charles repositioned his troops among his two armies and swiftly moved north against Jourdan. The Archduke {{defeated}} the Army of Sambre and Meuse at the Battle of Wetzlar on 15 June 1796 and Jourdan lost {{no time in}} recrossing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> of the west shore of the Rhine at Neuwied. Following up, the Austrians clashed with Kléber's divisions at Uckerath, inflicting 3,000 casualties on the French for a loss of only 600. After his success, Charles left 35,000 men with Wartensleben, 30,000 more in Mainz and the other fortresses and moved south with 20,000 troops to help Latour. Kléber withdrew into the Düsseldorf defenses.|$|E

50|$|Another, unusual variant {{was found}} in the Ortgies {{semi-automatic}} pistols. <b>To</b> disengage <b>the</b> <b>safety,</b> a user would squeeze a lever until flush with the rear of the grip. The lever then would latch in the disengaged position until the user released it again by pressing a button under the slide, whereupon tension from the striker spring would push it back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> engaged position. Thus, engaging <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> also relieved some tension in the striker spring. As the Ortgies is a pocket pistol meant for personal defense, this feature eliminates the problem of failing <b>to</b> disengage <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> when one needs <b>to</b> shoot. Gripping <b>the</b> pistol tightly is all it takes <b>to</b> disengage <b>the</b> <b>safety.</b>|$|R

5|$|Male {{pinnipeds}} generally play little role {{in raising}} the young. Male walruses may help inexperienced young {{as they learn}} to swim, and have even been recorded caring for orphans. Male California sea lions have been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Males can also pose threats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> of pups. In terrestrially breeding species, pups may get crushed by fighting males. Subadult male South America sea lions sometimes abduct pups from their mothers and treat them like adult males treat females. This helps them gain experience in controlling females. Pups can get severely injured or killed during abductions.|$|E
5|$|Piquet, on a {{one-stop}} strategy {{after his}} poor qualifying performance, had fortuitously pitted immediately prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> car's deployment {{and was also}} fuelled {{to the end of}} the race. Promoted to third place from 14th beforehand following the pit stops, he was set to take the lead once Hamilton and Heidfeld (who also had not pitted under the safety car conditions) pitted for their final stops. Further back, Vettel squeezed past Alonso at the pit exit, pushing him over the white line separating the pit lane exit from the track. Alonso complained over his radio but no action was taken against either driver. Meanwhile, Räikkönen dropped several places to 11th, having had to queue behind Massa at the second pit stops.|$|E
