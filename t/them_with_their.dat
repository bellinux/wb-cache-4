5|$|American {{rock band}} Aerosmith (Steven Tyler, Tom Hamilton, Joey Kramer, Joe Perry and Brad Whitford) {{appears in the}} episode. They were the first band to make a guest {{appearance}} on the show. Their dialogue was recorded in Boston with Hank Azaria, the voice of Moe, who flew over to record his part with them and help <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> lines.|$|E
5|$|Drones {{can also}} mate with {{existing}} queens by entering a foreign colony. When the drone is initially {{attacked by the}} workers, it releases a mating pheromone. If recognized as a mate, it will be carried to the queen to mate. Males may also patrol the nest and fight others by grabbing <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> mandibles, piercing their exoskeleton and then marking them with a pheromone. The marked male is interpreted as an invader by worker ants and is killed.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{themselves}} {{are subject to}} predation. Most species are preyed on by the killer whale or orca. To subdue and kill seals, orcas continuously ram <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> heads, slap <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> tails and fling them in the air. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer whales, but they are occasionally hunted by larger groups or by lone individuals. Pups are more commonly taken by orcas, but adults can be targeted as well. Large sharks are another major predator of pinnipeds—usually the great white shark but also the tiger shark and mako shark. Sharks usually attack by ambushing them from below. The prey usually escapes, and seals are often seen with shark-inflicted wounds. Otariids typically have injuries in the hindquarters, while phocids usually have injuries on the forequarters.|$|E

5|$|A {{particular}} {{definition of}} Mitică and mitici {{was adopted by}} many inhabitants of Transylvania, who used the terms in reference to either Bucharest-based politicians or inhabitants of the city at large, and contrasted <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> counterparts to the northwest. The character has thus evolved to include a stereotypical view of contemporary Bucharesters or Wallachians, one which depicts them as , arrogant, aggressive and cunning. In other contexts, the mitici {{may be seen as}} not having an adequate familiarity with the culture of Transylvania, and are associated with the Balkans (whereas Transylvania is identified with Central Europe).|$|E
5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, secondary fermentation, or baking {{to reach their}} drinking potential. For instance, a green tea puerh, prior to curing into a post-fermented tea, is often bitter and harsh in taste, but becomes sweet and mellow through fermentation by age or dampness. Additionally, oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the tea with aromas and flavours or by storing <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> flavorants.|$|E
5|$|Aphids {{and other}} hemipteran insects secrete a sweet liquid called {{honeydew}}, when they feed on plant sap. The sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect. In some cases, the aphids secrete the honeydew {{in response to}} ants tapping <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> antennae. The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another. When migrating to a new area, many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew. Ants also tend mealybugs to harvest their honeydew. Mealybugs may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their natural enemies.|$|E

5|$|During the day, tammars {{stay close}} to scrub for shade and move out to more open {{grassland}} by nightfall. Like all macropods, the tammar is herbivorous. They are known to both graze and browse, but the latter is less effective, as they commonly drop leaves when chewing on them. When eating large leaves, tammars handle <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> forelimbs. This species spends more time chewing its food than other similar sized macropods, which likely aids digestion. Tammars commonly feed on acacia seeds. Other species consumed include heart-leaved poison (Gastrolobium bilobum), small-flowered wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia setacea), and marri (Corymbia calophylla). Tammars survive on several islands that have no fresh water, subsisting on seawater and the moisture in plants.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{training}} period was for six weeks; {{later it was}} changed to eight weeks. General in scope, the program was designed to give cadets an overall view of the USCG. Academic study included: administration, correspondence, communications, history, organization, personnel, public speaking, ships, and special lectures and visual aids. The regimental part of {{the training}} was designed to help cadets adjust to military life, and to acquaint <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> responsibilities as officers. The cadets {{ranged in age from}} 20 to 40, with diverse civilian backgrounds from teachers and journalists to lawyers and technicians.|$|E
5|$|Large whales, such as mysticetes, are {{not usually}} subject to predation, but smaller whales, such as monodontids or ziphiids, are. These species are preyed on by the killer whale or orca. To subdue and kill whales, orcas {{continuously}} ram <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> heads; this can sometimes kill bowhead whales, or severely injure them. Other times they corral the narwhals or belugas before striking. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer orcas, but they are seldom attacked by an individual. Calves are more commonly taken by orcas, but adults can be targeted as well.|$|E

Unable to understand, Laurie stabs Michael with his own knife before escaping the house; Michael chases her, but Loomis arrives and shoots him. Recovering, Michael recaptures Laurie before she can leave and heads back to the house. Loomis again intervenes, but Michael subdues him. Laurie takes Loomis' gun and runs upstairs, but Michael corners her on a balcony and charges her head-on, knocking both of them over the railing. Laurie finds herself {{on top of an}} unconscious Michael. Aiming Loomis' gun at his face, she fires just as Michael awakens.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Poe leaves <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> Aunt Josephine, {{a kindly}} {{woman who is}} {{nonetheless}} obsessed with grammar and has irrational fears. Olaf appears disguised as Captain Sham to interfere with their plans again. One day, Josephine is not at the house, leaving what is apparently a suicide note; Klaus takes advantage of mistakes in the letter's grammar (which Josephine would never have tolerated) to decode her location; Curdled Cave. A hurricane sweeps through the town, ultimately destroying the house but allowing the children to flee before the structure falls apart. They sail to the cave and rescue her, but attract leeches due to Josephine having eaten a banana. Olaf appears and takes the kids with him, throwing Josephine off the boat and to the Lachrymose Leeches after she annoys him by correcting his speech.|$|E
5|$|On 12 January 1996, {{investigators}} {{announced that}} they would perform DNA testing on the drivers of all vehicles similar to the Mercedes. This {{was the first time}} the method was used nationally to identify a murder suspect. Detectives traced more than 1,000 vehicles and tested 5,000 drivers. On 19 February, West Mercia Police confirmed that a man had been arrested and was helping <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> inquiries. The following day, authorities announced that the suspect was English and had been arrested in Poole, Dorset in a joint operation between West Mercia and Dorset Police. He was subsequently identified as Stuart Morgan, a 36-year-old self-employed lorry driver, who on 21 February was remanded following an appearance at Redditch magistrates.|$|E

5|$|Some SS {{members were}} subject to summary execution, torture, and beatings {{at the hands of}} freed prisoners, {{displaced}} persons, or Allied soldiers. American soldiers of the 157th Regiment, who entered the concentration camp at Dachau in April 1945 and saw the human deprivation and cruelty committed by the SS, shot some of the remaining SS camp guards. On 15 April 1945, British troops entered Bergen-Belsen. They placed the SS guards on starvation rations, made them work without breaks, forced them to deal with the remaining corpses, and stabbed them with bayonets or struck <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> rifle butts if they slowed their pace. Some members of the US Army Counter Intelligence Corps delivered captured SS camp guards to displaced persons camps, where they knew they would be subject to summary execution.|$|E
5|$|The 2/18th {{attempted}} {{to defend the}} Tengah Airfield, but by 1:00pm in the afternoon of 9 February they {{had been reduced to}} only 330 men and were withdrawn back to the south-east of the airfield, occupying a position around Bulim along the Chu Kang Road, with the 2/29th Battalion on their left. Throughout the night of 9/10 February, minor clashes occurred as patrols were sent out to fend off Japanese probes. The battalion continued to hold the line until 6:00am when, following receipt of orders to withdraw, it moved back to Keat Hong village to take up the role of brigade reserve. The carrier platoon covered the battalion's withdrawal, and amidst heavy artillery shelling, they ambushed two Japanese columns, each roughly company-sized, inflicting heavy casualties upon <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> Vickers machine-guns before breaking contact.|$|E

5|$|The {{game is a}} side-scrolling shoot 'em up and {{revolves}} around the protagonist, Lieutenant Dale Hawkins, recovering caches of hidden Stinger missiles from Arab terrorists in Oman. The game features {{a total of five}} levels with varying locations and begins with allocating five lives to the player. The main objective of the game is to locate and place time bombs on boxes containing Stinger missiles, in which the player is required to escape before the time runs out. The enemies featured in the game are Arab terrorists; the player must neutralise them by shooting <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> selected weapon, which is a handgun by default. Other weapons available in the game include machine guns, rocket launchers, and a flamethrower, which are only accessible through finding hidden crates.|$|E
5|$|The same {{applies to}} herbivores, animals that eat plants, {{and the plants}} that they eat. In the Rocky Mountains, red {{squirrels}} and crossbills (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the lodgepole pine. The squirrels get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, {{making it more difficult}} for squirrels to get at the seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it more difficult for crossbills to get at the seeds. The lodgepole's cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.|$|E
