The financial support of this EU objective is frequently justified by expected positive environmental impacts, most notably the mitigation of climate change, and by favorable employment effects in the agricultural sector. This paper investigates the environmental and economic implications of the support of rapeseed-based biodiesel {{as a substitute for}} fossil diesel. Based on a survey of recent empirical studies, we find that the energy and greenhouse gas balances of this environmental strategy are clearly positive. Yet, its overall environmental balance is currently far from being unequivocally positive. Most importantly, biodiesel is not a cost-efficient emission abatement strategy. Thus, for the abatement of greenhouse gases,we recommend more efficient alternatives based on both renewable and conventional technologies.

Directive 2003 / 30 /EC thus aims at increasing the share of biofuels in <b>total</b> <b>EU</b> fuel <b>consumption</b> by up to 5. 75 % by 2010.

This paper investigates the environmental, economic, and social implications of the support of rapeseed-based biodiesel as a substitute for fossil diesel. Based on a meta-analysis of recent empirical studies, we find clearly positive energy and greenhouse gas balances of this environmental strategy. Yet, the overall environmental balance of the substitution of rapeseed-based biodiesel for fossil diesel is currently far from being unequivocally positive. Our major finding is, however, that biodiesel is not a cost-efficient emission abatement strategy. When taking all economic, ecological, and social aspects into account, we conclude that Biodiesel is not a sustainable solution. We therefore suggest more efficient climate gas abatement strategies. Among these alternatives are synthetically generated biofuels that can substitute for fossil fuels in the future...|$|R

A number of institutions are currently acting to secure the Gulf of Guinea with growing co-operation between the region and extra-regional actors. However, the lack of capabilities, weak governance within the region and the willingness to take action from extra-regional actors have undermined the securitization, and thus, the Gulf of Guinea has remained politicized...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The EU Parliament {{has agreed}} on a target of a 20 % share of {{renewables}} in the <b>EU’s</b> <b>total</b> energy <b>consumption</b> by 2020. To achieve the target, the Council has adopted mandatory differentiated national targets {{for each of the}} Member States. In this paper we consider the potential for cost reductions by allowing for trade in green certificates across Member States. We show that differentiated national targets cannot ensure a cost effective implementation of the overall target for <b>EU’s</b> green energy <b>consumption.</b> Trade in green certificates can ensure a cost effective distribution of green energy production, but the national targets prevents a cost effective distribution of energy consumption. Nevertheless, our numerical model indicates that EU-wide trade in green certificates may cut the <b>EU’s</b> <b>total</b> cost of fulfilling the renewable target by as much as 70 % compared to a situation with no trade. However, the design of green certificate markets may have large impact on the distribution of costs across countries...|$|R

40|$|In {{accordance}} with the <b>EU</b> <b>total</b> energy <b>consumption</b> reduction targets, increasing emphasis is being placed on involving every consumer in implementing energy efficiency measures. One possibility is to reduce energy consumption through smart technologies. In this context, the European Union has set an ambitious target for 2020 : to equip 80 % of households with smart meters. Currently there is no national strategy for smart technology, nor legislation, nor any {{vision for the future}} are not reflected. The only piece of legislation that sets targets for energy end-use efficiency is the Energy End-Use Efficiency Act 26. Significant energy end-user involvement in energy efficiency measures can not be achieved using existing analog meters. Smart electricity meters present broader possibilities.

40|$|International audienceAccording to European Commission (EC), {{houses and}} {{buildings}} considering their whole life cycle {{are responsible for}} 40 % of <b>total</b> <b>EU</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> Buildings are also the largest source of greenhouse gases emissions, accounting for 36 % of overall European CO 2 emission. Taking into account that 85 % of the total energy consumption within a building life cycle is related to building operation phase, savings related to usage of buildings {{seem to have the}} highest potential impact for a consumption reduction. According to Buildings Performance Institute Europe, in 2009 European households were responsible for 68 % of the total final energy used in buildings where as much as 70 % of the energy is used for space heating. Considering global sustainability challenges and in link with the 2020 targets (20 % energy demand reduction, 20 % CO 2 reduction and 20 % of energy from renewable sources), ICT enabler technologies are expected to become a key solution for the reduction of energy consumption in residential housing in the upcoming years. ICT based solution developed and tested in the SHOWE-IT project provide the home automation and consumption monitoring for in the residential housing sector with the goal of achieving 15 % - 20 % reduction in gas and energy consumption. The SHOWE-IT project provided an excellent opportunity to try in a real life environment a system, which was meant to become an optimal combination of technologies to address the energy reduction challenges in the residential buildings. Over the lifetime of the project it became clear that a combination of off-the-shelf technologies does not always perform as expected. The project results in many lessons learned which are to be considered in the future development and application of ICT based technologies for the residential housing sector. This paper presents and shares the learning and the experiences obtained during the SHOWE-IT project...|$|R

With the use of Energy-Management-Systems it is possible to save up to 15 %. In recent years, design approaches have greatly diversified, but with the emergence of ubiquitous- and context-aware computing, energy feedback solutions can be enriched with additional context information. In this study, we present the concept “room as a context” for eco-feedback systems.

40|$|One of the {{priorities}} of energy policies of the European Union (EU) is to generate 20 % of <b>EU's</b> <b>total</b> energy <b>consumption</b> from renewable energy (RE) sources by 2020. The EU policy framework mainly emphasizes economical and technical aspects of RE sources, and promotes large scale projects. However the local implementation of RE EU policies can lead to spatial misfits if the policy implementation neglects the peculiarities of the place. It {{is important to understand}} the misfits and relationship between the EU RE policies and the local implementation process, as misfits can affect the policy implementation process and subsequently policy outcomes can be different from those intended, leading to inapt or inapplicable measures. This article presents findings of a qualitative in-depth study of Malta’s RE policy implementation. The paper shows that planning of central large-scale RE projects in Malta provokes land and marine use conflicts and can cause difficulties in implementation. The concerned key actors implement the policies according to their motivation, perception, and capacity, and the context in which they are embedded. Hence, both the EU RE policy framework and the national interaction process influence the implementation process, which can lead to spatial mismatches...|$|R
