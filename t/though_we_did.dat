Despite her family background, her father disapproved of women entering films because he believed it conflicted with the traditional maternal duties and responsibility of women in the family. This led to a conflict between her parents, and they separated. She was then raised by her mother, who worked several jobs to support her daughters until Karisma debuted as an actress in 1991. After living separately for several years, her parents reconciled in October 2007. Kapoor remarked [...] "My father is also an important factor in my life [...] <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not see him often in our initial years, we are a family now." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Spanish {{forces and}} their allies {{advanced}} into the city. Despite inflicting heavy casualties, the Aztecs could not halt the Spanish advance. While the fighting in the city raged, the Aztecs cut out and ate the hearts of 70 Spanish prisoners-of-war at the altar to Huitzilopochtli. By August, many of the native inhabitants had fled Tlatelolco. Cortés sent emissaries {{to negotiate with the}} Tlatelolcas to join his side, but the Tlatelolcas remained loyal to the Aztecs. Throughout the siege, the Tlaxcalans waged a merciless campaign against the Aztecs who had long oppressed them as for hundreds of years the Tlaxcalans had been forced to hand over an annual quota of young men and women to be sacrificed and eaten at the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan, and now the Tlaxcalans saw their chance for revenge. The American historian Charles Robinson wrote: [...] "Centuries of hate and the basic viciousness of Mesoamerican warfare combined in violence that appalled Cortés himself". In letter to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, [...] Cortés wrote: [...] "We had more trouble in preventing our allies from killing with such cruelty than we had in fighting the enemy. For no race, however savage, has ever practiced such fierce and unnatural cruelty as the natives of these parts. Our allies also took many spoils that day, which we were unable to prevent, as they numbered more than 150,000 and we Spaniards only some nine hundred. Neither our precautions nor our warnings could stop their looting, <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> all we could...I had posted Spaniards in every street, so that when the people began to come out [...] they might prevent our allies from killing those wretched people, whose numbers was uncountable. I also told the captains of our allies that on no account should any of those people be slain; but there were so many that we could not prevent more than fifteen thousand being killed and sacrificed [...] that day".|$|E

60|$|Even {{dining and}} {{sleeping}} at an inn formed a pleasing novelty, <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not exactly sympathise with Martyn when he dashed in at breakfast exulting in having witnessed {{the killing of}} a pig.

"If we wasn't your friends, Joe, {{you might}} {{give us a}} bluff like that, an' even if we didn't take it, we'd make out as <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>did.</b> See here," [...] and {{unfolding}} a newspaper, Dan pointed to an advertisement, as he added, [...] "I saw this almost 'fore I {{got out of the}} Herald office, an' didn't stop for anything but jest to pick up Tim an' Jerry before I come to find you." ...|$|E
60|$|Then he {{told how}} many times the big guns had been fired during the late assault, and stated that we had {{two hundred and fifty}} rounds of {{ammunition}} remaining for the cannon.

60|$|It is easy {{to suppose}} that at the noise of Friday's pistol we all mended our pace, and rode up {{as fast as the}} way, which was very difficult, would give us leave, to see what was the matter.
