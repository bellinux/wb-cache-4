"Chamber acid" [...] and [...] "tower acid" [...] {{were the}} two {{concentrations}} of sulfuric acid produced by the lead chamber process, chamber acid being the acid produced in lead chamber itself (<70% to avoid contamination with nitrosylsulfuric acid) and <b>tower</b> <b>acid</b> being the acid recovered {{from the bottom of}} the Glover tower. They are now obsolete as commercial concentrations of sulfuric acid, although they may be prepared in the laboratory from concentrated sulfuric acid if needed. In particular, [...] "10M" [...] sulfuric acid (the modern equivalent of chamber acid, used in many titrations) is prepared by slowly adding 98% sulfuric acid to an equal volume of water, with good stirring: the temperature of the mixture can rise to 80nbsp&°C (176nbsp&°F) or higher.|$|E
40|$|A membrane-based gas–liquid {{contacting}} {{process was}} evaluated {{in this work}} for CO 2 removal from flue gases. The absorption of CO 2 from a CO 2 –N 2 mixture was investigated using a commercial hollow fiber membrane contactor and water or diethanolamine as absorbing solvents. Significant CO 2 removal (up to 75 %) was achieved even {{with the use of}} pure water as absorbent. By using aqueous amine solutions and chemical absorption, mass transfer improved, and CO 2 removal was nearly complete (, 99 %). A mathematical model was developed to simulate the process and it was validated with experimental data. Results show that membrane contactors are significantly more efficient and compact than conventional absorption <b>towers</b> for <b>acid</b> gas removal...|$|R
50|$|This {{includes}} the dusting tower, cooling pipes, scrubbers, drying tower, arsenic purifier and testing box. Sulphur dioxide has many impurities such as vapours, dust particles and arsenous oxide. Therefore, {{it must be}} purified to avoid catalyst poisoning (i.e.: destroying catalytic activity and loss of efficiency). In this process, the gas is washed with water, and dried by sulphuric acid. In the dusting tower, the sulphur dioxide is exposed to a steam which removes the dust particles. After the gas is cooled, the sulphur dioxide enters the washing tower where it is sprayed by water to remove any soluble impurities. In the drying <b>tower,</b> sulphuric <b>acid</b> is sprayed on the gas to remove the moisture from it. Finally, arsenic oxide is removed when the gas is exposed to ferric hydroxide.|$|R
50|$|SO2-rich gases {{enter the}} {{catalytic}} converter, usually a tower with multiple catalyst beds, and are converted to SO3, achieving {{the first stage}} of conversion. The exit gases from this stage contain both SO2 and SO3 which are passed through intermediate absorption <b>towers</b> where sulfuric <b>acid</b> is trickled down packed columns and SO3 reacts with water increasing the sulfuric acid concentration. Though SO2 too passes through the tower it is unreactive and comes out of the absorption tower.|$|R
50|$|After the ion exchangers, the brine is {{considered}} pure, and {{is transferred to}} storage tanks to be pumped into the cell room. The pure brine is heated to the correct temperature to control exit brine temperatures according to the electrical load. Brine exiting the cell room must be treated to remove residual chlorine and control pH levels before being returned to the saturation stage. This can be accomplished via dechlorination <b>towers</b> with <b>acid</b> and sodium bisulfite addition. Failure to remove chlorine can result in damage to the ion exchange units. Brine should be monitored for accumulation of both chlorate anions and sulfate anions, and either have a treatment system in place, or purging of the brine loop to maintain safe levels, since chlorate anions can diffuse through the membranes and contaminate the caustic, while sulfate anions can damage the anode surface coating.|$|R
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the problem of the chronic toxicity of sulphur dioxide in pulp mills. Fifty-four workers at four different pulp mills working in the <b>acid</b> <b>towers</b> and digester plants have been investigated with special regard to symptoms and signs of respiratory disease. Vital capacity has been measured with a `Kifa' apparatus and maximal expiratory flow with a Wright peak flow meter. The concentration of sulphur dioxide in the working atmosphere has been measured during general working conditions on a single day, and the values were found to range between 2 and 36 parts per million...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{possible}} {{emission of}} sulfuric acid mists from a laboratory scale, counter-current packed bed tower operated with a caustic scrubbing solution was studied. Acid mists were applied through a local exhaust hood. The emissions from the packed bed tower were monitored {{in three different}} categories of gas flow rate as well as three liquid flow rates, while other influencing parameters were kept almost constant. Air sampling and sulfuric acid measurement were carried out iso-kinetically using USEPA method 8. The acid mists were measured by the barium-thorin titration method. According to the results when the gas flow rate increased from 10 L/s to 30 L/s, the average removal efficiency increased significantly (p[*] 3, respectively. L/G of 2 – 3 was recommended for designing purposes of a packed <b>tower</b> for sulfuric <b>acid</b> mists and vapors removal from contaminated air stream. </p...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{documents}} {{the results of}} the experimental treatment of groundwater (flow rate: 300 m 3 h- 1) polluted by the leachate of an old MSW landfill (7 million tonnes) in northern Italy. The process consists of a coagulation-flocculation pre-treatment at pH > 11, and subsequent ammonia stripping, after heating the water to 35 - 38 °C by means of the biogas produced by the landfill. The stripped ammonia was recovered by absorption with sulfuric acid, producing a 30 % solution of ammonium sulfate, which was reused as a base fertilizer. In addition, the paper reports important operational aspects related to the scaling of the stripping tower’s packing and its effect on pH and temperature profiles inside the towers caused by the closed loop, which recirculates the stripping air coming from the ammonia absorption <b>towers</b> with sulfuric <b>acid.</b> The average removal efficiency of ammonia reached 95. 4 % with an inlet mean concentration of 199. 0 mg L- 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOperational {{transformation}} {{gives us}} an opportunity to review our operation methods in a way to measure our performance and focus on a rational strategy to improve the PS 3 plant productivity and reduce SO 2 emissions. This paper will detail specific process methodologies such as nondestructive process inspection (for example stick test provides operators with information about acid carryover in <b>acid</b> <b>towers,</b> operators can adjust acid and gas parameters depending on the result of the test and also to prepare spare parts for the next shutdown, another example is the pegasys test: pressure drop and conversion rate measurement of each catalyst bed helps operators optimizing the converter by adjusting the inlet temperature of each bed of catalyst). Other methodologies like process hazard analysis which addressed a cultural change into the team and also reinforced the relationship between operation and maintenance that's what leads us to reach a high level of performance. We will present after how preventive maintenance has helped us to predict future failures in some strategic equipment such as gas heat exchanger, turbine, blower…etc. An intelligent design modification was also a key factor to improve the reliability of the entire PSIII sulfuric unit. Our history can’t be concluded without talking about overhaul schedules and planning. The capitalization of all best practices and procedures allows us to adapt and standardize our maintenance tasks and activities, in way to create our own systemic overhaul process, that includes mainly safety instructions and CND inspections and controls(vibration, thermography, Oil Analysis, Foucault current measurement, check-list controls for major and risky tasks…etc) adapted for each equipment with specific and detailed reports, and done by experienced and certified OCP Staff (for example ISO certification on vibration and thermography) ...|$|R
