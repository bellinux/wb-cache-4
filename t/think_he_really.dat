500|$|Chotiner's {{strategy}} in the Nixon congressional races remains controversial. Former congressman Voorhis dubbed himself [...] "the first victim of the Nixon-Chotiner formula for political success". Democrats labeled him a master of dirty tricks who ruthlessly destroyed Douglas's political career by intimating that she was soft on communism. Chotiner's son Kenneth later stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> believed [...] was evil... He would equate a liberal or a Democrat with a communist." [...] Chotiner himself said of the campaign against Douglas, [...] "We only stated the facts. The interpretation of the facts was the prerogative of the electorate." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} album in Europe, Kiedis and Frusciante both agreed {{they would make}} the trip. However, it proved {{difficult}} for Frusciante to adapt to life outside of the mansion, after being in near-seclusion for almost 30 days. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "He had such an outpouring of creativity while we were making that album that I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> didn't know how to live life in tandem with that creativity." [...] It was also during this period when Frusciante began to experiment with heroin, which further compromised his mental stability. The European promotional trek took its toll on Frusciante, {{and he decided to}} return home when he and Kiedis reached London.|$|E
500|$|Renwick {{has stated}} that the {{production}} of any further Jonathan Creek specials will depend on reception to [...] "The Grinning Man", {{as well as his}} own schedule. Davies is amenable to reprising the lead role in future, stating: [...] "If David writes more, I'm happy to do them. Unless they turned up and they were awful - but it hasn't happened so far. And he wouldn't send me an awful one anyway. But I don't know if he will come up with another one. He always says that the writing is so difficult, I'm not sure it gives him any pleasure. But I think the shooting gave him a lot of pleasure this time. He was directing {{for the first time and}} I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> enjoyed it. So, we'll see." ...|$|E
5000|$|Olu Dara's cornet {{work was}} the first on-wax {{collaboration}} with his son. [...] "Jungle Jay" [...] and [...] "Dance" [...] eventually followed, as did the 2004 single [...] "Bridging the Gap". According to Nas: [...] "I asked my dad {{to play on the}} end of it — I told him to play whatever comes to mind when <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> of me as a kid. I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>really</b> proud to see me coming up and really taking my life serious and doing what I want." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'd {{be willing}} to try if it was of any use. But it isn't," [...] said Prickly Porky, who didn't want Peter to <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>really</b> was as hard-hearted as he had seemed at first.|$|R
500|$|Kyle Busch, who {{finished}} second, said, [...] "He {{was on a}} mission today, that's for sure. When Jeff Gordon has a good car {{and he has the}} opportunity to beat you, he's going to beat you. He's my hero. I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years." [...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 23, 2008, Frazier {{verbally}} {{committed to}} the Penn State Nittany Lions basketball team. He said to Scout.com, [...] "I decided to be a Nittany Lion because I {{felt it was a}} great fit for me. Penn State has great academics as well as a great basketball team and that's what I was looking for." [...] Frazier also said that he had a [...] "great time" [...] on his official visit and all his relatives supported the decision. He received offers from various other schools across the country, including Bradley, Colorado State, New Mexico State, Santa Clara, Stanford, Stephen F. Austin, and UTEP. Frazier was also visited by San Diego, TCU, and Penn State, spanning from September to October 2008. After the move was made official, head coach Ed DeChellis said, [...] "We are very excited to have Tim join our program. He is a very fast, quick player with tremendous speed in the backcourt and a good shooter. He possesses the kind of athleticism that Stanley Pringle does. He can get in the lane and find open guys and is a great drive and kick passer and he can score. He is a very good on-the-ball defender and a tremendous athlete and we <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> solidifies our backcourt for the future." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} to the United States, California Chrome was turned out for a month at Taylor Made Farm, then resumed {{training}} with Sherman. On July 23, the horse was entered in the San Diego Handicap where he faced Dortmund, who had finished third in the 2015 Kentucky Derby to American Pharoah. California Chrome tracked behind Dortmund until the far turn, then moved to the front. Dortmund fought back and the two dueled down the stretch, with California Chrome prevailing by half a length while carrying five pounds more than Dortmund. [...] A month later, California Chrome challenged an all-star field in the Pacific Classic, which included a rematch with Dortmund as well as long-time rival Hoppertunity. [...] Most notably, Chrome met the champion mare Beholder for the first time. Beholder, third favorite on the morning line, had won the previous year in her debut against male horses, the only female horse to have ever won that race. California Chrome got the number one post position in the nine-horse field, viewed as an unfavorable draw because, other than his prep race win at Meydan Racecourse, he previously did poorly on the rail. [...] The post position {{turned out not to be}} a problem, as the horse broke cleanly and quickly went to the lead, led throughout the entire race, and only Beholder kept close to him until the mile pole, at which point he pulled ahead of the field and won by five lengths. [...] Espinoza kept a relatively firm hold on the horse throughout the race, and Beholder's rider, Gary Stevens, commented, [...] "Victor was playing with us. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> let him run. That's scary to think about." [...] In similar form, he again was challenged by Dortmund in the Awesome Again Stakes on October 1. [...] The two horses at one point outdistanced the rest of the field by 12 lengths, but California Chrome led throughout and won by [...] lengths. [...] Art Sherman commented, [...] "You're looking at maybe the best horse in the world right now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! that, sir," [...] replied Smither doubtfully, [...] "I couldn't take {{on me to}} say. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> might; <b>he</b> <b>really</b> is a {{wonderful}} man for his age." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the manga, while Haruto still <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> doesn't <b>really</b> {{fit in the}} Council in his own words, he's noticeably more mature, {{reliable}} and level-headed than his anime incarnation, and gets along somewhat better with the spirits.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes; I know." [...] Then {{he would}} remain lost in thought, softly {{whistling}} to himself. On {{one of these}} occasions he asked, [...] "Do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was <b>really</b> very much troubled by his false position?" ...|$|R
500|$|Lynsey {{was found}} dead by Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan). The death sparked a [...] "whodunit storyline" [...] with Mercedes in the frame for her murder. Digital Spy {{explained}} her motives stating, [...] "Mercedes has also become increasingly deranged in recent weeks and wanted to keep Lynsey quiet after she discovered the truth about her stalking of Mitzeee". A promotional image featuring Mercedes was later released by Hollyoaks which confirmed Mercedes as an official suspect in the mystery. Mercedes entered a relationship with Doctor Browning, who had previously paid her for sex, {{in an attempt to}} make Riley jealous. Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she [...] "was nervous about the union of the dark soul mates, Mercy and Browning, but their chemistry is so watchable - that story is pretty dark". Mercedes began to [...] "fall for the charms" [...] of Doctor Browning, believing she had [...] "landed on her feet" [...] when he invited her to a charity ball. Metcalfe commented that Mercedes began to think he could provide her with the WAG life style that she had always wanted. She added that Mercedes still had feelings for Riley and was [...] "being very sneaky" [...] in her attempts to win him back. She explained that Mercedes [...] "still wants Riley back but, as we know, when she has everything she desires, she still craves a bit of danger". Thompson elaborated on this, saying Mercedes [...] "thinks she wants the quiet life with Riley, but Dr Browning offers an exciting alternative for her, he knows what makes her tick, {{and the two of them}} are excited by how dangerous the other is". On Doctor Browning's feelings for Mercedes, Thompson said: [...] "he's fallen for her and will do whatever it takes to be with her. He thinks if he spends enough time with Mercy, he'll win her around". When Doctor Browning witnessed Riley kiss Mercedes [...] "it becomes a question of how much he can take" [...] and he decided he must [...] "make a quick move" [...] to prevent them reuniting. To do this he takes Mercedes to a shooting range, Thompson explained that there she [...] "realises there's an undeniable connection between them". He added that the couple are [...] "kindred spirits" [...] and Mercedes spending time with him made her rethink their relationship. Thompson said [...] "it seemed to be written in the stars that Mercedes and Riley will get back together - but Dr Browning won't let that happen" [...] and to do this he threatened Riley. Thompson claimed that due to Doctor Browning having incriminating evidence showing that Mercedes discharged herself at the time Lynsey was murdered it gives him [...] "real power, she thinks she's in control, but she might just be underestimating Dr Browning..." [...] Metcalfe said that she feels Doctor Browning is Mercedes soul mate, explaining that [...] "he gives as good as he gets and I think that's really good for my character". On who Mercedes loves more out of Doctor Browning and Riley, Metcalfe said [...] "it's Doctor Browning all the way for her, i <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> took her by storm and she absolutely adores him". On 17 August 2012 during E4's first look episode it was revealed Doctor Browning had killed Lynsey. Hollyoaks official website said Doctor Browning's motives in killing Lynsey were [...] "presumably to protect Mercedes".|$|E
2500|$|Son Robert James Tatangelo (born ca. 1951) {{said that}} his father was [...] "always ... honest and {{straight}} forward with people, and that's what people counted on. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> did make a difference." [...] Daughter Linda T. McKinney remembered her father for his equal treatment of people: [...] "It didn't matter where you came from. If you were from the barrio or if you were a multi-millionaire he would treat you the same. He accepted everybody[...] [...] [...] There was no social/economic division ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{beginnings}} of a Mascis–Barlow détente started in the mid-'90s when Mascis began showing up at Sebadoh shows. [...] "I think {{he was kind of}} aware of how much shit I was talking about him, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> ever pursued any of it. One of the things that really triggered this, for me to finally just go, 'Hey, you know, maybe this could work,' is when I realized that maybe J wasn't really holding any kind of grudge against me because he didn't like me. I was thinking, maybe he just didn't realize what he had done, or maybe he wasn't really aware of how much he'd actually hurt me. And when I started to realize that, he kind of became more human to me," [...] Barlow noted in a 2005 interview.|$|E
60|$|As for {{our friend}} James, {{he was at}} first sobered, then deeply moved, and at last wholly absorbed by the discourse; {{and it was only}} when meeting was over that <b>he</b> began to <b>think</b> where <b>he</b> <b>really</b> was.|$|R
6000|$|He then {{proceeded}} to make some further remarks, with so much equanimity and composure that I began to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> had <b>really</b> not seen what I had seen, and I whispered--"Miss Fanshawe is here: have you noticed her?" ...|$|R
5000|$|I think Wilson puts up with House for {{the same}} reason that {{millions}} of people watch him every week. I <b>think</b> <b>he’s</b> <b>really</b> dynamic and fun and audacious and self-deprecating. All those things that I think make people <b>really</b> appealing, and <b>he</b> tells it like it is. The money things, he doesn’t tend to pay you back, but I have a lot of friends like that. So I don’t find it that much of a mystery. I think House is a very attractive character. I think most people would want to be friends with him. Robert Sean Leonard ...|$|R
2500|$|Harrison Ford {{considers}} Deckard to be human. [...] "That was {{the main}} area of contention between Ridley and myself at the time," [...] Ford told an interviewer during a BBC One Hollywood Greats segment. [...] "I thought the audience deserved one human being on screen that they could establish an emotional relationship with. I thought I had won Ridley's agreement to that, but in fact I {{think he had a}} little reservation about that. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> wanted to have it both ways." [...] Scott suggests that Ford may have since changed his view, although Blade Runner 2049 director Denis Villeneuve claimed that Ford and Scott argue about the issue to this day. Other people involved in the movie's production who have expressed the view that Deckard is human include: David Snyder (art director), M. Emmet Walsh (who portrayed Bryant) and Rutger Hauer (who portrayed Roy Batty).|$|E

Don't you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has <b>really</b> a very poetical mind, and that he's putting all the rest on?" ...|$|R

A CD single was later released in the UK on 29 October 2007, and on 7 March 2008 in Germany. The song was released as the second single from the album in the United States on 1 April 2008. The song was written and produced by Klas Åhlund.
