5|$|After {{embarking on}} a small tour, the band set about {{recording}} Brave New World, their first studio album with Dickinson since 1992. Dickinson insisted that they find a replacement for the now retired Martin Birch, the band's regular producer, and record in a different studio than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they made No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark, to which Harris agreed. The album was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris with producer Kevin Shirley, after which Iron Maiden undertook a supporting tour culminating with a performance at the Rock in Rio festival before a crowd of 250,000.|$|E

5|$|Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow {{looked for}} effects with {{significant}} years. They asked 83 undergraduate students to rate, {{on a scale}} from 1 to 7, how much they liked the years between 1976 and 2001, the months of the year, the seasons, times of day, and even types of pet in an attempt to disguise the aim of the study. Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the year of their birth much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers also found that the year of high school graduation was also liked better than average. Of the months of the year, the most liked month was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the participants were born.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Russell Boyd largely {{utilized}} available {{light to}} give the movie a natural feel, which Beresford said was crucial to its sense of authenticity. Harper said Boyd was so quiet during filming that he mostly used just three words: Yeah', 'right' and 'sure. Beresford, Foote and Duvall considered the climactic scene to be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Mac, tending the family garden, discusses with Rosa Lee his pain over his daughter's death. Beresford and Boyd filmed the scene in a long take and long shot so it could flow uninterrupted, with the lonely Texas landscape captured in the background. When studio executives received the footage, they contacted Beresford and requested close-up shots be intercut, but he insisted on keeping the long take intact. Duvall said he felt the scene underscored Mac's stoicism {{in the face of}} tragedy and loss.|$|E
5|$|In a later review, McNulty praised scenes like <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Sasuke admits {{his crimes}} and agrees {{to go to}} prison, as it showed {{acceptance}} of responsibility for his misdeeds. McNulty also praised Sasuke's later journey of self-redemption, {{as well as his}} decision to respond to Sakura's feelings for him before leaving. IGN's Ramsey Isler considered Sasuke's change of heart drastic, but felt it was a fitting conclusion for the character after the series' events, and fit well with him once again leaving the village, this time on good terms with his friends and the village. Manga author Hiroaki Samura was pleased with Sasuke's character arc in the series, especially his influence on Naruto and {{the fact that in the}} end he returns to Konohagakure because of Naruto. While finding Sasuke's fate in the manga's ending predictable, McNulty felt that the character's monologue after his final fight with Naruto helped to show a deeper side to him.|$|E

5|$|Several {{thousand}} animal {{bones were}} discovered in Mummy Cave. While {{the large majority of}} the bones could not be identified, researchers at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) were able to determine the biological origins of over two thousand bones. As at many other archeological sites in the region, significant numbers of Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis) and deer from the genus Odocoileus were identified. Of particular interest to biologists was the much larger number of sheep than deer: eighty-eight sheep and fifteen deer were identified. Such a prevalence of sheep over deer is highly unusual for archeological sites in the region, because deer are equally or more plentiful in areas such as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Mummy Cave is located. This anomaly has led researchers at UTEP to propose that the site was used as a home base for hunters to operate at higher altitudes.|$|E

For example, chromatic adaptation transforms are used when converting images between ICC profiles with different white points. Adobe Photoshop, for example, uses the Bradford CAT.|$|E
