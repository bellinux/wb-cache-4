25|$|The {{reason of}} Pakistan's {{opposition}} to India's {{entry into the}} Organization of Islamic Cooperation {{is due to the}} human rights issues and problems faced by the Kashmiris in the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir(J). The Muslim world has always supported Pakistan rather than India, however the role of the OIC concerning the Kashmir issue is that India has the largest Muslim minority and those people have shown desire to join the OIC. While the First Islamic Summit did not have the issue of the Kashmir people, granting the 60 million Muslims living in India membership in the OIC was discussed. While General Yayha Khan of Pakistan did agree, he showed his extreme displeasure at the fact that at induction of Muslim representative Fakhruddin Ali Ahmad, he <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat,</b> which caused major controversy. Meanwhile, there were Muslims killed in anti-Muslim riots in Ahmedabad. Pakistan rejected this development and demanded the expulsion of India from the summit.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Iwata took a {{position}} at Nintendo {{as the head of}} its corporate planning division and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> on the board of directors. Over the next two years, he sought to reduce the cost and length of game development while preserving quality. During his first two years at Nintendo, the company saw profit increases of 20 and 41percent, values which are at least partially attributable to his work. When Yamauchi, the company's president since 1949, retired on May24, 2002, Iwata succeeded as Nintendo's fourth president with Yamauchi's blessing. He was the first Nintendo president unrelated to the Yamauchi family through blood or marriage since its founding in 1889. Yamauchi left the company in Iwata's hands with a final request: [...] "that Nintendo give birth to wholly new ideas and create hardware which reflects that ideal. And make software that adheres to that same standard." [...] Iwata inherited a company that promoted individualism, with a policy established by Yamauchi to create new development positions as needed. However, this inhibited efficient collaboration between certain departments.|$|E
500|$|The Long Branch Saloon Shootout, {{involving}} Levi Richardson, {{a buffalo}} hunter, and [...] "Cockeyed Frank" [...] Loving, a professional gambler, happened on April 5, 1879.

In the saloon, Frank sat down at a long table, Richardson turned around and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> at the same table. The two were then heard speaking in low voices. After the conversation, Richardson drew his pistol, and Loving drew his in response. The Long Branch Saloon was then filled with smoke. Dodge City Marshal Charlie Bassett, who was in Beatty & Kelley's Saloon, heard the shots and came running. Both men were still standing, although Richardson had fired five shots from his gun and Loving's Remington No. 44 was empty. Deputy Sheriff Duffey threw Richardson down {{in a chair and}} took his gun, while Bassett disarmed Loving. Richardson then got up and started toward the billiard table, when he fell to the floor with a fatal gunshot in the chest, as well as a shot through the side and another through the right arm. Frank Loving, who had only a slight scratch on the hand, was immediately taken to jail. Two days later, the coroner's inquest ruled that the killing had been in self-defense and Loving was immediately released.|$|E

She chooses Will, and {{at the opening of the}} picture informs Jim of her choice. But a change comes to the fortunes of Susan's father: an unlucky speculation claims his wealth and his life. When Will discovers that his fiancé is penniless his love cools; he breaks the engagement and goes to Europe to avoid the girl. Susan, friendless, starts out to earn her own living. She applies for a job in a lawyer's office, but leaves when the man insults her. She secures a place in a department store, but is discharged because, fatigued after an arduous day at the counter, she <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> while on duty. She applies for work in a factory, but is rejected, owing to lack of experience. Finally, in desperation, she takes a place as maid in the home of Mrs. Gray. There Burg, the offensive lawyer, meets her, and in a spirit of revenge, denounces her as a thief. The mistress discharges her and Susan decides to end her life. Fortunately for Susan, Burg meets Jim Briggs, the rejected suitor, on the street and laughingly tells him how he brought about Susan's discharge. Jim knocks the wretch down and rushes to Mrs. Gray's residence. He arrives in time to dissuade Susan from her purpose, and all ends happily to the peal of wedding chimes." ...|$|E
