40|$|EVALUATION AND DETERMINATION OF THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF A Treponema pallidum DRIED BLOOD SPOT (DBS) METHOD FOR SEROLOGIC DIAGNOSIS OF SYPHILIS Background: Syphilis is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} infection (STI) caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Syphilis {{is known as the}} 2 ̆ 2 great imitator 2 ̆ 2 due to the similarity of clinical signs and symptoms to other infectious diseases. The primary diagnosis of syphilis relies on clinical findings, including the examination of <b>treponemal</b> lesions, and/or <b>serologic</b> <b>tests.</b> <b>Serologic</b> <b>tests</b> are divided into nontreponemal and treponemal tests. Nontreponemal tests are useful for screening, while treponemal tests are used as confirmatory tests. Methods: A total of 200 serum and DBS specimens collected from patients at the Los Angeles Municipal Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinics were tested by the DBS and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) methods. These samples were sent to the Syphilis Diagnostics Laboratory, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia for testing. Samples were blindly evaluated by the TREP-SPOTTM DBS and the TREP- SURETM EIA methods for the detection of anti-treponemal IgG- and IgM-class antibodies.

40|$|A 55 -year-old man {{presented}} with a painless destruction of multiple joints and neurologic deficits. He was admitted with a painless pyogenic arthritis of the right ankle. Four years earlier, he had experienced instability of the right knee after an inexplicable, progressive but painless destruction of the joint. Radiographs showed erosive changes at the smaller joints of both hands and the left foot, as well as deformation and destruction of the right foot. Results from both <b>treponemal</b> and nontreponemal <b>serologic</b> <b>test</b> were positive in blood. The Treponema pallidum particle agglutination index was positive in the cerebrospinal fluid. Tabetic arthropathy was diagnosed. Tabetic arthropathy is a manifestation of neurosyphilis. Because syphilis is known as "the great imitator" and tertiary syphilis is rare, recognizing the disease is the biggest challenge for health care providers. Symptoms may mimic any other disease, and many different medical specialists may be faced with these patients, or as Sir William Osler put it: "He who knows syphilis, knows medicine. " Initial diagnosis is usually made on serum and cerebrospinal fluid examination. Penicillin is an effective treatment for neurosyphilis to stop progression of neurologic damage, {{but it does not}} cure the previously developed tabetic arthropathy. This case is reported to raise awareness of this uncommon but important manifestation of tertiary syphilis.

40|$|<b>Serologic</b> <b>testing</b> is {{essential}} for the diagnosis of some infectious diseases and yet is fraught with potential pitfalls. All parts of the diagnostic process must be optimized to ensure that <b>serologic</b> <b>tests</b> perform adequately. Recognizing that a lack of clinical data and correctly timed, paired sera frequently led to uninterpretable serology results at our laboratory, we developed and implemented simple acceptability criteria for <b>serologic</b> <b>tests.</b> We assessed the impact of these criteria by comparing submissions and results for the year before and the year after implementation of the criteria.

Urea breath test is {{the gold standard for}} noninvasive diagnostic test, but it is expensive and not available in most hospitals. The Bio M Pylori <b>serologic</b> <b>test</b> has good diagnostic value in adults, less expensive and more practical, but had never been evaluated in children. Objective To determine the prevalence of H. pylori infection and the diagnostic accuracy of Bio M Pylori <b>serologic</b> <b>test</b> in children with recurrent abdominal pain. Methods This study was conducted in May - June 2009. Children aged 12 - 15 years with recurrent abdominal pain were examined with urea breath test and the Bio M Pylori <b>serologic</b> <b>test.</b> Sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), predictive values, and likelihood ratios were calculated for the Bio M Pylori <b>serologic</b> <b>test.</b> Results Most subjects aged 13 years (83 %). Girls outnumbered boys, and most were undernourished. The prevalence ofH. pylori infection detected by urea breath test and Bio M Pylori <b>serologic</b> <b>test</b> was 8 % and 52 %, respectively. The Bio M Pylori <b>serologic</b> <b>test</b> had sensitivity and specificity of 100 % and 53 %, respectively. Area under the curve (AUC) was 0. 764.

40|$|BACKGROUNDThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess the cost {{effectiveness}} of introducing individual-donation nucleic acid testing (ID-NAT), in addition to <b>serologic</b> <b>tests,</b> compared with the exclusive use of <b>serologic</b> <b>tests</b> for the identification of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) I and II among blood donors in Zimbabwe. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSThe costs, health consequences, and cost effectiveness of adding ID-NAT to <b>serologic</b> <b>tests,</b> compared with <b>serologic</b> <b>testing</b> alone, were estimated from a health care perspective using a decision-analytic model. RESULTSThe introduction of ID-NAT in addition to <b>serologic</b> <b>tests</b> would lower the risk of HBV, HCV, and HIV transmission to 46. 9, 0. 3, and 2. 7 per 100, 000 donations, respectively. ID-NAT would prevent an estimated 25, 6, and 9 HBV, HCV, and HIV transfusion-transmitted infections per 100, 000 donations, respectively. The introduction of this intervention would result in an estimated 212 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is estimated at US$ 17, 774 /QALY, a value far more than three times the gross national income per capita for Zimbabwe. CONCLUSIONAlthough the introduction of NAT could further improve the safety of the blood supply, current evidence suggests that it cannot be considered cost effective. Reducing the test costs for NAT through efficient donor recruitment, negotiating the price of reagents, and the efficient use of technology will improve cost effectiveness...|$|R

Conventional {{methods for}} diagnosis of brucellosis include <b>serologic</b> <b>tests</b> and blood culture. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the culture of clinical specimens and <b>serologic</b> <b>test</b> for the diagnosis of brucellosis. Materials & Methods: In a 15 -month period, all patients with clinical suspected brucellosis were enrolled in this comparative-descriptive study. Blood specimens for all patients were obtained for culture and <b>serologic</b> <b>tests</b> including wright, coombs' wright and 2 ME. A questionnaire including demographic, clinical and paraclinical characteristics was completed for each subject. Results: A total of 149 patients were enrolled in the study. The most common symptoms were fever, malaise, myalgia and sweating. Osteoarticular complications were observed in 106 (71. 1 %) patients, of which, the most common type was sacroiliitis in 67 patients (45 %). The results of <b>serologic</b> <b>tests</b> including wright, coombs’ wright, and 2 ME were positive in 88. 6 %, 87. 5 % and 88. 5 % of the patients.

40|$|We {{developed}} log-linear and logistic-modeling {{approaches to}} investigate dependence among diagnostic tests. To illustrate the approaches, we used published data for swine toxoplasmosis, bovine paratuberculosis, and swine brucellosis.
