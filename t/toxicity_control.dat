The inclusion of a <b>toxicity</b> <b>control,</b> e.g. glucose of acetate, can help to distinguish between non-degradability cased by persistence or by toxic inhibition.

40|$|In this study, a preset {{oxidation-reduction}} potential (ORP) {{was employed to}} regulate oxygen dosing for online sulfide <b>toxicity</b> <b>control</b> during anaerobic treatment of high sulfate wastewater. The experiment was conducted in an upflow anaerobic reactor (UAF), which was operated at a constant influent total organic carbon (TOC) of 6740 mg/L (equivalent to a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 18000 mg/L) but with different influent sulfates of 1000, 3000 and 6000 mg/L. The reactor was initially run without oxygen injection at a natural ORP of about- 290 to - 300 mV and then was followed by oxygenation to raise ORP by + 25 mV above the natural level for each influent sulfate level. With 1000 and 3000 mg/L influent sulfates, the produced sulfide levels did not impose any appreciable toxicity to methanogens even without oxygen injection. However, with 6000 mg/L influent sulfate without oxygen injections, the dissolved sulfide level quickly went up to over 800 mg/L which imposed a significant suppression on methanogenesis. Upon oxygen injection to raise the ORP by + 25 mV, the dissolved sulfide was quickly reduced to 160 mg/L. If more oxygen was injected to raise the ORP by + 50 mV, then dissolved sulfide further decreased to 12. 2 mg/L with a concomitant improvement in methane yield by 45. 9 %. With a + 25 mV preset ORP increase, {{it was found that}} at the 1000 mg/L influent sulfate the supplied oxygen was more than that needed for sulfide oxidation. The excess oxygen could be utilized readily by facultative heterotrophs for organic oxidation, which contributed 13. 5 % of the total COD removal in the UAF. At the higher sulfate levels of 3000 and 6000 mg/L, the facultative contributions to the total COD removal were only 4. 7 and 4. 1 %, respectively.

We explore whether IMRT offers further reductions in late rectal toxicity for men already being managed with IGRT and compare this with more gradual changes over time. Methods: Between 2007 and 2009, 103 patients with PC were treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3 D-CRT n[*]=[*] 52) or IMRT (n[*]=[*] 51) with doses of 74 – 78 [*]Gy at 2 [*]Gy per fraction. All men had daily IGRT using intra-prostatic gold fiducials. The primary endpoint was incidence of grade ≥ 2 late rectal toxicity as graded by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale. Results: The relative risk of late grade ≥ 2 rectal toxicity in patients treated with IMRT was 68 % less than seen with image-guided 3 D-CRT at 36 months post-treatment (7 % versus 22 %; hazard ratio[*]=[*] 0. 32, P[*]=[*] 0. 03).

40|$|This thesis reports two {{new methods}} {{developed}} {{to study the}} free ion activity of aluminum and copper. Both methods {{could be applied to}} the study of other metals. The first method measures the apparent solubility of aluminum and sulfate in a dynamic, leached system. This system is believed to give a good representation of the field situation where soils are continuously leached and never at equilibrium. This study was done under three sulfate concentrations. The part of the experiment using low sulfate concentrations showed aluminum solubility control by a gibbsite-like solid phase with a log K$ sp circ$ of 7. 49. It was also shown, however, that under natural soil solution concentrations of sulfate in acidic forest soils, an interaction with sulfate controls aluminum activity rather than gibbsite solubility equilibria. This interaction is either, an aluminum-sulfate solid phase or, a stoichiometric ion-pair co-adsorption of aluminum and sulfate. The second method is a simple determination of free Cu$ sp{ 2 +}$ in soils using a cupric ion-selective electrode. Free copper has been demonstrated to be the <b>toxicity</b> <b>controlling</b> component in aquatic studies and this study was undertaken to measure free copper activity in soils. The possible interference due to ionic strength variations or the presence of aluminum in the soil solution was checked and found to be negligible. The free activity of copper (pCu$ sp{ 2 +}$) measured in a variety of pristine and contaminated soils varied between 6. 33 to 12. 20 pCu$ sp{ 2 +}$ units.

40|$|Anaerobic {{treatment}} of high sulfate wastewater generates sulfide as a terminal end product of sulfate reduction. The sulfide so produced is inhibitory to methane producing bacteria at high concentrations. This {{will not only}} lower the methane yield but also lead to treatment performance deterioration and/or failure. There has been lack of an appropriate method to control sulfide toxicity. It is therefore essential to develop a suitable method for sulfide <b>toxicity</b> <b>control</b> by eliminating the sulfide {{as fast as it}} is produced. In this study, an online sulfide <b>toxicity</b> <b>control</b> was achieved through injection of pure oxygen to biogas recirculation stream to oxidize sulfide. Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) was used as a controlling parameter to regulate the pure oxygen injection. The ORP based sulfide control method was tested in a completely mixed reactor and upflow anaerobic filter for its effectiveness to control the sulfide. The system ORP was precisely maintained within ± 10 mV of the target ORP during oxygenation. The elevation of natural ORP by + 25 mV (i. e. Target ORP = Natural ORP + 25 mV) was found appropriate for the online sulfide control for higher sulfate level of 6000 mg/L. The actual needed ORP increase depended on both the influent sulfate level and also wastewater characteristics. The ORP controlled oxygenation was able to oxidize more than 98. 5 % of the produced sulfides (gaseous and dissolved) when influent sulfate levels were 1000, 3000, 5000, and 6000 mg/L. During oxygenation, a part of influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) was oxidized by facultative bacteria at all influent sulfate levels. The extent of facultative activity was found strongly dependent on the sulfide levels. When sulfide was low, the facultative activity was high, and vice versa. During oxygenation, the methane yield declined at low influent sulfate levels (when the sulfide levels were below the inhibitory level) due to substrates diversion to facultative activity whereas at high influent sulfate levels (when the produced sulfide was above the inhibitory level), the methane yield improved appreciably due to alleviation of sulfide toxicity in comparison to natural ORP. The removal of total organic carbon (TOC) also improved at all influent sulfate levels during oxygenation with respect to natural ORP. There was as high as 8. 2 % increase in effluent sulfate level during oxygenation in comparison to natural ORP, and this was attributed to the substrate diversion to facultative activity instead of sulfide re-oxidation. The major pathway of sulfide oxidation appeared to be abiotic and elemental sulfur was the major end product. This conclusion was supported by a series of batch tests on abiotic sulfide oxidation. The presence of trace metals/nutrients in the aqueous phase was found to have a profound catalytic effect on the sulfide oxidation...|$|E

The oxygen dosing for sulfide oxidation was regulated by using oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) as a controlling parameter. During oxygenation at elevated ORPs of - 230 and - 180 mV (50 and 100 mV above natural ORP of - 280 mV, respectively), the dissolved and gaseous sulfides were completely eliminated {{which resulted in a}} concomitant improvement in methane yield by 56. 3 % at 5000 mg/L influent sulfate. However, at influent sulfates of 1000 and 3000 mg/L, both methane generation rate and sulfate removal efficiency were dropped appreciably at elevated ORPs. Facultative heterotrophs were found to consume as high as 66. 3 % of the influent COD during oxygenation. For effective sulfide oxidation at lower sulfate levels, it was no longer required to raise the ORP by as much as 50 or 100 mV. The actual needed ORP increase depended on the influent sulfate.

40|$|Polymers with a thermally-triggered phase {{transition}} {{are important in}} the design of materials for biological applications where their behavior can be used to trigger release or (dis) assembly events. Despite their advantages, a system with tuneable thermal response, end-group reactive sites, low <b>toxicity</b> and <b>controlled</b> main-chain degradability has not been realised, yet would represent a significant advance. We report the versatile new poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) vinyl acetate) s with excellent control over their molecular properties obtained through RAFT/MADIX polymerization. Furthermore, we demonstrate structure-controlled thermal transitions, conjugation to human lysozyme through the retained end group and moreover show that this class of polymers can uniquely be copolymerized with 2 -methylene- 1, 3 -dioxepane (MDO) to generate polymers in which the degradability and cloud point can be independently tuned to create materials that display the same cloud point but degrade differently...|$|R
40|$|Lectins are {{carbohydrate}} recognizing proteins {{originating from}} diverse origins in nature, including animals, plants, viruses, bacteria and fungus. Due to their exceptional glycan recognition property, {{they have found}} many applications in analytical chemistry, biotechnology and surface chemistry. This manuscript explores the current use of lectins for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Moreover, novel drug delivery strategies aiming at improving lectin’s stability, reducing their undesired <b>toxicity</b> and <b>controlling</b> their non-specific binding interactions are discussed. We also explore the nanotechnology application of lectins for cancer targeting and imaging. Although many investigations are being conducted {{in the field of}} lectinology, there is still a limited clinical translation of the major findings reported due to lectins stability and toxicity concerns. Therefore, new investigations of safe and effective drug delivery system strategies for lectins are warranted in order {{to take full advantage of}} these proteins...|$|R
40|$|A 24 -h {{pretreatment}} with BNDF enhanced excitotoxic {{neuronal death}} in cultured mouse cortical cells challenged with NMDA {{in the presence}} of extracellular Mg 2 +. The GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline, enhanced NMDA <b>toxicity</b> in <b>control</b> cultures but, unexpectedly, became neuroprotective in cultures pretreated with BDNF. In contrast, drugs that activate GABAA receptors (e. g. muscimol, benzodiazepines, or phenobarbital) or drugs that indirectly enhance GABAergic transmission were protective in control cultures but amplified NMDA toxicity after pretreatment with BDNF. The atypical behaviour of GABAergic drugs in cultures pretreated with BDNF depended on changes in the anion reversal potential because (i) increases in extracellular Cl−concentrations abolished the neurotoxic action of muscimol; (ii) muscimol stimulated 36 Cl− efflux after pretreatment with BDNF; and (iii) exposure to BDNF reduced the expression of the neuronal K+/Cl−co-transporter, KCC 2. Our data raise the concern that GABAergic drugs may become neurotoxic under conditions associated with increases in brain BDNF levels...|$|R
