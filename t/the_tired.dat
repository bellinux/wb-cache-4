5|$|In May 1800 Napoleon, by {{then the}} undisputed leader of France, brought his troops across the Alps to Italy once again. On 14June his army met the Austrian forces at the Battle of Marengo (near Alessandria). Austrian troops were {{initially}} successful; by mid-morning they were {{in control of the}} field of battle. Their commander, Michael von Melas, sent this news south towards Rome. However, fresh French troops arrived in late afternoon, and Napoleon attacked <b>the</b> <b>tired</b> Austrians. As Melas retreated in disarray with the remains of his army, he sent a second courier south with the revised message. The Neapolitans abandoned Rome, and the city spent the next fourteen years under French domination.|$|E
5|$|Polyaenus's {{accounts}} {{have led}} some modern historians to tentatively propose the following {{synthesis of the}} battle. After the general engagement had been in progress for some time, Philip had his army perform a wheeling manoeuver, with the right wing withdrawing, and the whole line pivoting around its centre. At the same time, wheeling forward, the Macedonian left wing attacked the Thebans on the Greek right and punched {{a hole in the}} Greek line. On the Greek left, the Athenians followed Philip, their line becoming stretched and disordered; the Macedonians then turned, attacked and routed <b>the</b> <b>tired</b> and inexperienced Athenians. The Greek right wing, under the assault of the Macedonian troops under Alexander's command, then also routed, ending the battle.|$|E
5|$|When Miranda {{attacked}} that morning, Coburg's {{first reaction}} was to draw substantial troops from his center to reinforce his right flank. Initially, Archduke Charles' men were driven back to Dorsmael but then they {{held on to the}} village. The French Reserve captured Leau and threatened Halle but was soon thrown back. The main fighting occurred between 3:00 and 6:00 PM when Miaczinski's column seized Dorsmael but counterattacks drove his soldiers out. Other attacks withered {{in the face of the}} strong Coalition defenses. Charles saw an opportunity and hurled his cavalry on <b>the</b> <b>tired</b> French soldiers. The Left Wing became so demoralized that its troops were driven back to Tienen before Miranda could rally them. When Dumouriez heard of the defeat of Miranda's wing on the morning of the 19th he was forced to order a retreat.|$|E
50|$|Higher volume {{producers}} typically utilize specialized {{tire and}} wheel mounting and inflation equipment which is partially or fully automated. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> size, machines {{may be a}} single station or multistation. In these machines, <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is inflated using high volume, high pressure compressed air that flows into <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> around <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> bead rather than through the valve stem. When <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> has achieved <b>the</b> desired inflation pressure, the machine's inflation head moves away from <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and <b>the</b> inflation process is completed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> earth-rammed <b>tires</b> of an Earthship are {{assembled}} by teams of two people. One person shovels dirt {{and places it}} into <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> one scoop at a time. The other person, who stands on <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> uses a sledgehammer to pack the dirt in while moving {{in a circle around}} <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to keep <b>the</b> dirt even and to avoid warping <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
50|$|RFV {{can best}} be {{explained}} by example. Assume a perfectly uniform tire mounted on a perfectly round wheel loaded with a constant force against a perfectly round test wheel. As the wheel turns, it turns <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> carcass undergoes repeated deformation and recovery as it enters and exits the contact area. If we measure the radial force between <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and <b>the</b> wheel we will see zero change as <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> turns. If we now test a typical production tire we will see the radial force vary as <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> turns. This variation will be induced by two primary mechanisms, variation in the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and variation in the elastomeric properties of <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
5|$|With the {{uncertainty}} {{caused by the}} Utah War, the Church called off all European emigration for 1858. In 1859 one handcart company crossed the plains. The emigrants were now able to travel by rail to Saint Joseph, Missouri, after which they went by riverboat to Florence, where they were outfitted with handcarts and supplies. When the 1859 company reached Fort Laramie, they discovered their food was running dangerously short, so they cut back on rations. When they reached Devil's Gate the last flour was distributed. Emigrant Ebeneezer B. Beesley recalled an incident in which a group of rough mountain men fed the hungry emigrants. One of the mountain men then asked a young woman from the company to stay with him, which <b>the</b> <b>tired</b> woman agreed to do. (William Atkin recalled another {{version of the story}} in which two young women married two mountain men.) The hunger worsened when expected supplies were not available when they reached the Green River. Three days later wagons from Utah carrying provisions finally rescued the famished emigrants.|$|E
5|$|From {{before midnight}} on 27 March, <b>the</b> <b>tired</b> 12th Brigade {{had been holding}} the railway line between Albert and Dernancourt, having {{relieved}} the 9th (Scottish) Division. The forward positions of the salient held by the 12th Brigade were along the railway line, which ran along a series of embankments and cuttings, up to but not including a railway bridge immediately northwest of Dernancourt where the Dernancourt–Laviéville road passed under the railway. A mushroom-shaped feature known as the Laviéville Heights overlooked the railway line, which curved around its foot. This was difficult ground to defend, particularly where the railway line curved and skirted the northwestern corner of Dernancourt, as if the line there was overrun, the enemy {{would be able to}} fire into the rear of the troops lined out along the railway in both directions. Despite this, the Australian commanders considered it important to hold the railway line; if it was not garrisoned, the enemy could assemble in the dead ground behind the embankment. A further difficulty arose from the fact that if an attack occurred during daylight, it would be almost impossible to move troops down the exposed slopes to reinforce the railway line without crippling losses, and troops withdrawing from the railway line would be similarly exposed. To afford them some protection along the railway line, the forward posts dug one-man niches in the near side of the embankment, but the only way for them to fire was to climb up and lie on top of the embankment, thus exposing themselves to enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|On 15 and 16 May, another {{attempted}} Soviet {{offensive in}} the north met the same resistance encountered on the three {{first days of the}} battle. German bastions continued to hold out against Soviet assaults. The major contribution to Soviet frustration in the battle was the lack of heavy artillery, which ultimately prevented the taking of heavily defended positions. One of the best examples of this was the defense of Ternovaya, where defending German units absolutely refused to surrender. The fighting was so harsh that, after advancing an average of five kilometers, the offensive stopped for the day {{in the north}}. The next day saw a renewal of the Soviet attack, which was largely blocked by counterattacks by German tanks; <b>the</b> <b>tired</b> Soviet divisions could simply not hold their own against the concerted attacks from the opposition. The south, however, achieved success, much like the earlier days of the battle, although Soviet forces began to face heavier air strikes from German aircraft. The Germans, on the other hand, had spent the day fighting holding actions in both sectors, launching small counterattacks to whittle away at Soviet offensive potential, while continuously moving up reinforcements from the south, including several aircraft squadrons transferred from the Crimea. Poor decisions by the 150th Rifle Division, which had successfully crossed the Barvenkovo River, played a major part in the poor exploitation of the tactical successes of the southern shock group.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{puncturing}} of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> a flat can {{be caused}} by:failure of or damage to the valve stem;rubbing of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> against <b>the</b> road, ripping <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> or separation of tire and rim by collision with another object; excessive wear of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> tread allowing explosive tire failure or allowing road debris to tear through it.|$|R
50|$|A {{beadlock}} or bead lock is {{a mechanical}} device that secures the bead of a <b>tire</b> to <b>the</b> {{wheel of a}} vehicle. Tires and wheels are designed so that, when <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is inflated, <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> pressure pushes <b>the</b> bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> against <b>the</b> inside of the wheel rim so that <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> stays on <b>the</b> wheel and the two rotate together. In situations where tire pressure is insufficient to hold the bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> in place, a beadlock is needed.|$|R
5000|$|An {{internal}} beadlock is {{very much}} like an inner tube within <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> that pushes <b>the</b> bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> tight against <b>the</b> wheel. The internal beadlock is inflated via its own valve stem. The side of the beadlock closest to the tread, the [...] "case", has a layer of thick fabric, generally polyester, which keeps the beadlock from inflating too far up into <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> This forces <b>the</b> sides into <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> which compresses <b>the</b> bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> against <b>the</b> wheel.|$|R

25|$|When Kollowrat finally {{reported}} the II Armeekorps available for duty that evening, the headquarters ordered his troops {{to make an}} overnight march west to Hemau on the north bank of the Danube. In the morning, <b>the</b> <b>tired</b> troops were recalled to Regensburg from their pointless ramble.|$|E
25|$|The Orcs and Dunlendings {{then raised}} {{hundreds}} of ladders to scale the wall. Aragorn and Éomer repeatedly motivated <b>the</b> <b>tired</b> defenders to repel the Orcs {{coming up the}} ladders. However, some Orcs had crept in through a culvert which let a stream out of Helm's Deep, and while the defenders were busy with {{the assault on the}} wall, they were suddenly attacked from behind. This was repulsed and the culvert was blocked up under Gimli's supervision.|$|E

And by modeling the air in <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> cavity-resonance noise is able to simulate. Finite element model also enables to verify easily the effect of structure modification...|$|R
50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of patching a tire is {{that due to}} the process requiring one to remove <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> from <b>the</b> wheel, <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> must be balanced again when it is put back on <b>the</b> wheel. <b>Tire</b> sealant also creates an imbalance in <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> but since it is a temporary repair, it is considered less of an issue. However, the issue of disposal of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> sealant, <b>the</b> hazards to the technician, {{as well as the}} required cleaning of both the inside of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> as well as the wheel could all be considered disadvantages of tire sealant.|$|R
50|$|Tires can leak air for {{a variety}} of reasons. These include, but are not limited to: damage to the wheel itself, a damaged valve stem, a {{puncture}} in <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> (which can be hard to find if the puncturing object didn't embed itself in <b>the</b> <b>tire)</b> and improper installation of <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> which could involve the bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> being cut when installed with excessive force.|$|R
25|$|The Welsh, {{particularly}} those of North Wales, used the javelin {{as one of their}} main weapons. During the Norman and later English invasions, the primary Welsh tactic was to rain javelins on <b>the</b> <b>tired,</b> hungry and heavily armoured English troops and then retreat into the mountains or woods before the English troops could pursue and attack them. This tactic was very successful, since it demoralized and damaged the English armies while the Welsh ranks suffered little.|$|E
25|$|Davout's {{artillery}} arrived about 3:00 pm, {{having been}} delayed by a staff blunder. Backed by artillery support for the first time, <b>the</b> <b>tired</b> French infantry retook the first ridge. An artillery colonel scouted the woods on the Austrian right flank and found a promising position to post his guns. When he reported his discovery to Saint-Hilaire, the two improvised a new attack. Saint-Hilaire waved his men forward in a new frontal attack while a horse artillery battery slipped into position unnoticed by the Austrians.|$|E
25|$|The {{race was}} re–run, and <b>the</b> <b>tired</b> Mick was never close to placing. He slipped {{at the first}} bend whilst {{attempting}} to take the inside. Seldom Lad overtook Golden Hammer and won the race unchallenged, with Mick finishing in fourth place. Mick's time in the voided race was 29.89seconds, some {{two and a half}} lengths faster than Seldom Lad's time in the second. Mick lost a fourth race in a row for the first time ever, and the Derby trophy was awarded to Seldom Lad's owners amid a host of boos from the crowd.|$|E
50|$|The bicycle pump {{compresses}} air. When {{the cylinder}} is compressed, air is pushed down the tube of the pump {{and then into}} <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> via <b>the</b> valve, which is forced open by {{the pressure of the}} air. When the handle is pulled up again, the valve shuts off automatically so that the air cannot escape from <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and new air is forced back into the cylinder so the process can be repeated. Some pumps have a gauge that shows the pressure of air that is forced into <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is at <b>the</b> correct pressure, the pump valve can be removed from <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and <b>the</b> cap can be replaced on <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> valve.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tire</b> {{is first}} centered, and the bead areas are {{lubricated}} to assure a smooth fitment to the measurement rims. <b>The</b> <b>tire</b> is indexed into the test station {{and placed on}} the lower chuck. The upper chuck lowers {{to make contact with}} the upper bead. <b>The</b> <b>tire</b> is inflated to the set point pressure. The load wheel advances to contact <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and apply <b>the</b> set loading force. The spindle drive accelerates <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to <b>the</b> test speed. Once speed, force, and pressure are stable, load cells measure the force exerted on the load wheel by <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> <b>The</b> force signal is processed in analog circuitry, and then analyzed to extract <b>the</b> measurement parameters. <b>Tires</b> are marked according to various standards that may include RFV high point angle, side of positive conicity, and conicity magnitude.|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> {{is running}} from the police, it comes across {{a group of people}} burning a large pile of <b>tires.</b> <b>The</b> film then jumps to three days later showing the results of a killing spree. The cops find <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> {{watching}} an auto racing program in a house, having killed the occupants. Chad rigs a mannequin (resembling <b>the</b> woman <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is interested in) with dynamite, intending for <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to blow <b>the</b> mannequin's head up, thereby detonating the dynamite and destroying itself. However, when <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> destroys <b>the</b> mannequin's head, the dynamite does not explode. Enraged, Chad shoots and kills <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> with a shotgun, after which he gives <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to <b>the</b> man in the wheelchair. A tricycle emerges from the house and kills the man in the wheelchair. The tricycle begins rolling down <b>the</b> road; other <b>tires</b> begin rolling behind it and they eventually roll to Hollywood, where the film concludes.|$|R
25|$|In 1976, {{the entire}} Chicago {{commuter}} rail system began to receive {{financial support from}} the State of Illinois through the Regional Transportation Authority. Operating funds were disbursed to all commuter operators and the Rock Island was to be provided with new equipment to replace <b>the</b> <b>tired</b> 2700 series and Capone cars. New Budd bilevels that were near copies of the 1961 Milwaukee Road cars arrived in 1978. New EMD F40PH units arrived in late 1977 and, in summer, 1978, briefly could be seen hauling Capone cars. The Rock Island's commuter F and E units were relegated to freight service or the dead line.|$|E

During the next three years, partly in Bressanone and partly in Rome, he began to write his first novel, Gli indifferenti (Time of Indifference), published in 1929. The novel is a realistic analysis of the moral decadence of a middle-class mother and two of her children. In 1927, Moravia met Corrado Alvaro and Massimo Bontempelli and started his career as a journalist with the magazine 900. The journal published his first short stories, including Cortigiana stanca (<b>The</b> <b>Tired</b> Courtesan in French as Lassitude de courtisane, 1927), Delitto al circolo del tennis (Crime at the Tennis Club, 1928), Il ladro curioso (The Curious Thief) and Apparizione (Apparition, both 1929).|$|E
25|$|However, {{a setback}} {{occurred}} when Fergusson's brigade tried to capture Indaw on 24 March. The original intention {{had been to}} seize the town and its airfields on 15 March but Fergusson had to report that this was impossible. Wingate appeared ready to change the brigade's mission but on 20 March, he reinstated Indaw as the target. The brigade was already exhausted from its long march, {{and there was no}} time to properly reconnoitre the objective. The units were dismayed to find that the Japanese controlled the only water sources. Fergusson expected that 14th Brigade would cooperate in the attack, but they moved west instead. Japanese reinforcements had also moved into Indaw, which was a major road and rail centre. Fergusson's battalions, attacking separately, were each repulsed. After this, most of <b>the</b> <b>tired</b> 16th Brigade were flown out.|$|E

30|$|As {{the running}} wheel uses rubber <b>tires,</b> <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> parts of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> are {{subjected}} to uneven pressure during the crossing of the finger-band, resulting in {{a change in the}} amount of deformation and a vertical vibration of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> [7, 8].|$|R
5|$|The {{combination}} of these two opposite torques creates a resulting yaw torque on the front wheel, and its direction {{is a function of}} the side-slip angle of <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> <b>the</b> angle between the actual path of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and <b>the</b> direction it is pointing, and the camber angle of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> (<b>the</b> angle that <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> leans from <b>the</b> vertical). The result of this torque is often the suppression of the inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in the section on steady-state turning.|$|R
25|$|Nevertheless, new {{and rebuilt}} {{locomotives}} {{arrived on the}} property in gleaming blue and white to replace some of <b>the</b> <b>tired,</b> filthy power. Track rebuild projects covered the system. Main lines that had seen little or no maintenance in years were pulled from the mud. Rail and tie replacement programs attacked the maintenance backlog. However, the FRA-backed loans that Ingram sought were thwarted by the lobbying efforts of competing railroads, who considered a healthy Rock Island as a threat. By 1978, main line track improved in quality. For example, {{at the end of}} that summer, the Illinois Division had no slow orders: freight velocity was rising. The sale of the Golden State Route to the Southern Pacific had been agreed to. The Rock Island slowly inched towards a financial break-even point, despite the financial malaise that plagued the late 1970s.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>tired</b> German Fourth Army and German Ninth Army {{closed the}} pocket around Smolensk. SKG 210, the Bf 110-equipped close support unit {{destroyed}} or knocked out 165 tanks, 2,136 motor vehicles, 194 artillery, 52 trains and 60 locomotives with wagons. In the campaign since 22 June, it had accounted for 915 Soviet aircraft, 823 on the ground. Still, some 100,000 Red Army soldiers escaped by Kesselring's estimate. Most escaped at night, which showed {{even when the}} Luftwaffe had air superiority, it lacked the all-weather, round the clock capability to prevent the withdrawals. Walther von Axthelm's I Flak Cops played {{an important part in}} operations south of Smolensk. As well as using his 101st and 104th motorised regiments, each with three heavy and one light battalion, supported the Second Panzer Army. It was used to protect the ground forces, and claimed 500 Soviet aircraft between the 22 August and 9 September, but was also used against ground targets. It claimed 360 Soviet vehicles in the same period.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tire</b> is fitted by heating to a {{controlled}} temperature, avoiding overheating.
