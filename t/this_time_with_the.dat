5|$|After the war, H.D. and Bryher {{no longer}} lived together, but {{remained}} in contact. H.D. moved to Switzerland where, {{in the spring}} of 1946, she suffered a severe mental breakdown, which resulted in her staying in a clinic until the autumn of that year. Apart from a number of trips to the States, H.D. spent {{the rest of her life}} in Switzerland. In the late 1950s, she underwent more treatment, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> psychoanalyst Erich Heydt. At Heydt's prompting, she wrote End to Torment, a memoir of her relationship with Pound, who allowed the poems of Hilda's Book to be included when the book was published. Doolittle was one of the leading figures in the bohemian culture of London in the early decades of the century. Her later poetry explores traditional epic themes, such as violence and war, from a feminist perspective. H.D. was the first woman to be granted the American Academy of Arts and Letters medal.|$|E

5|$|Ben Arfa {{made his}} league debut {{on the opening}} day of the season in a 4–4 draw with Rennes. He scored his first goal for Les Marseillais in that match. He {{continued}} in form scoring six times in his first 11 matches. However, his reputation for controversy continued to haunt him when he was involved in another dispute, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Cameroon international Modeste M'bami during a warm up session ahead of the club's UEFA Champions League match against Liverpool. The two had to be separated by Ronald Zubar. Controversy arose again following Marseille's 4–2 loss to Le Classique rivals Paris-Saint Germain. He drew the ire of manager Eric Gerets after his refusal to leave the bench to warm up. Ben Arfa later said he was injured much to the chagrin of Gerets, but later apologized for the incident to the media and Gerets himself. Upon his return to the squad, Ben Arfa responded by scoring a goal and providing the assists on both the other goals in a 3–1 victory over Saint-Étienne.|$|E
5|$|His {{first victory}} came on March 8, 1991, in a 5–3 {{performance}} over the Buffalo Sabres, and on January 9, 1992, he recorded his first shutout in a 2–0 win against the Toronto Maple Leafs. During <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Blackhawks, his goaltending coach was Vladislav Tretiak, who was {{selected in the}} 1983 draft but was barred from playing in the NHL by the Soviet government. Hašek appeared in game 4 of the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins, after Belfour allowed two goals on four shots in the opening 6:33, and had 21 saves. Although the Penguins won to clinch the Stanley Cup, Hašek's performance {{attracted the attention of}} the Sabres, who had considered trading for him earlier that season.|$|E
5|$|In 1328, Andronikos III finally overthrew his {{grandfather}} and {{established himself as}} sole emperor. Syrgiannes was freed, {{and was able to}} restore himself to Andronikos's favour, to the extent that in late 1329 he was entrusted with the important governorship of Thessalonica, the Empire's second-largest city, and of western Macedonia and Albania. There, he was again suspected of plotting against Kantakouzenos, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> emperor's mother, Empress Maria. She lived in Thessalonica, and was supposed {{to keep an eye on}} Syrgiannes; instead, she became so infatuated with him that she had him adopted. Following the death of the Empress in late 1333, the plot was uncovered and Syrgiannes was arrested and brought to Constantinople to face charges of treason. Syrgiannes, however, managed to escape and flee to the court of the Serbian ruler Stefan Dušan.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, {{the writer}} was still {{hoping for a}} return to the {{political}} stage, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Nationalist Democratic Party, which came to power under Nicolae Iorga. To this goal, he approached Internal Affairs Undersecretary Nicolae Ottescu, requesting appointment as prefect, but was refused. During the same period, Caragiale was occasionally involved in events affecting the cultural scene. In May 1930, he was present at a banquet in honor of Italian author Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the ideologue of Futurism. Organized by the Romanian Writers' Society and the Italo-Romanian Cultural Association, it was also attended by many other cultural figures, most of which, including artist Marcel Janco and the writers Ion Vinea, Jacques G. Costin, Ion Minulescu and Camil Petrescu, were associates of the magazine Contimporanul. In January 1934, linguist and publisher Alexandru Rosetti signed a contract with Caragiale, through which the latter agreed to complete Sub pecetea tainei and have it published by Rosetti's Editura Fundațiilor Regale.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Negus {{family moved}} to Haslemere, Surrey. During the Second World War, Negus again served in a medical capacity, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Emergency Medical Service (EMS) at Horton Hospital, Epsom, from 1939 to 1946. In 1940, on the {{retirement}} of his colleague Charles Hope, he had been appointed senior surgeon at King's College Hospital, and in 1946 he reached {{the peak of his}} profession as a consulting surgeon. During this post-war period one of Negus's patients was the former (and future) prime minister Winston Churchill, who in 1950 was diagnosed by Negus with high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Negus retired from clinical and teaching work in 1952 at the age of 65.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, the North Staffordshire Regiment {{consisted}} of two Regular and two Territorial battalions – the 1st and 2nd Regular and the 6th and 7th Territorials. Following {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War on 3 September 1939, the regiment was expanded as it had been during the First World War. This expansion, however, was limited this time only to the addition of two more battalions – the 8th and 9th battalions, of which both were raised in 1940 but later converted to other roles. The roles of the two regular battalions were reversed <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 1st Battalion serving in India and Burma throughout the war, while the 2nd Battalion remained in Italy and North Africa.|$|E

5|$|In early 1811 Montagu {{left the}} Adriatic.

Departing Ancona on March 11 with six frigates, numerous support craft and over 500 soldiers, the Franco-Italian squadron sailed for Lissa overnight. Early {{in the morning on}} March 12, the French were spotted by British observers on Lissa and Hoste brought his squadron, including the recently returned Cerberus and Active, to meet Dubourdieu off the island's northern coast.|$|E
5|$|In late July 1914, World War I {{broke out}} in Europe, though the Ottomans {{initially}} remained neutral. On 14 August, Berk-i Satvet joined patrols of the Dardanelles, the defenses of which were strengthened with several new minefields. Tensions between the Ottomans and a British fleet patrolling {{the entrance to the}} Dardanelles increased until 5 November, when Britain and France declared war on the Ottoman Empire. In the meantime, Berk-i Satvet had been transferred to the Black Sea. She joined the cruiser Midilli, formerly the German Breslau, for an attack on the Russian port of Novorossiysk on 29 October. Berk-i Satvet embarked on another attack, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> battlecruiser Yavuz Sultan Selim, formerly the German Goeben. The battlecruiser shelled Sevastopol while Berk-i Satvet observed; she had been sent with Yavuz Sultan Selim primarily to train her crew.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese {{forces in}} Manchukuo had {{sporadic}} border clashes with the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic. The Japanese doctrine of Hokushin-ron, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this policy would prove difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a Neutrality Pact in April 1941, and Japan adopted {{the doctrine of}} Nanshin-ron, promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to its war with the United States and the Western Allies.|$|E

5|$|It {{appeared}} that Brooks had exhausted all legal avenues at this point, but on June 16, 1873, he filed another lawsuit against Baxter, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pulaski County district court.

He issued a telegram to President Grant informing him of the basic situation in Arkansas and asked for federal troops to help him maintain the peace. Grant denied his request.|$|E
5|$|On 23 and 24 December, the 4th and 2nd Squadrons {{conducted}} gunnery practice {{north of}} the Hebrides. The following day, the entire fleet sortied for a sweep in the North Sea, which concluded on 27 December; this was Emperor of Indias first fleet operation.

On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 1719 April, followed by gunnery drills off the Shetlands on 2021 April.|$|E
5|$|On August5, 1964, a weak trough {{emerged from}} Florida over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. According to the Atlantic {{hurricane}} database (referred to as HURDAT), the system {{developed into a}} tropical depression by 18:00UTC (1:00p.m. CDT) that day, with its center located roughly 160mi (260km) south-southeast of the Mississippi River Delta. Moving generally west, the system exhibited no signs of further development as it neared the Texas coastline. However, on August7, radar images from Brownsville, Galveston, Lake Charles, and Victoria showed an abrupt increase in organization. During the afternoon hours, banding features consolidated around a developing eye and weather reconnaissance planes were dispatched to the system. Forecasters initially mistook the eye as a hook echo-type feature {{at the end of}} a squall line. It is estimated that the depression became a tropical storm by 12:00UTC (7:00a.m. CDT), roughly 60mi (95km) southeast of Galveston, Texas. Operationally, the system was not even monitored as a depression <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> classification and naming of Tropical Storm Abby occurring at 16:00UTC (11:00a.m. CDT) on August7.|$|E
