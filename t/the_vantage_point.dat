It was restored and relocated to the new National Park Service Visitor Center in September 2008.|$|E

25|$|Writers have {{described}} Mommsen's history as transformative of prior works on ancient Rome. He employed new sources, e.g., ancient inscriptions, {{in order to}} gain new insights. He also wrote in a new fashion. Yet his point of view itself was new, a product of his own life and times, a 19th-century outlook from middle Europe. From <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> of our latter era, the 19th-century view presents a result that appears now as somewhat of a distortion. On the other hand, each individual's outlook will necessarily encompass unique insights.|$|E
25|$|Purge Incomplete – Mary Jo Bole's exhibit {{explores the}} history of {{plumbing}} at the penitentiary. Interestingly, the building had running water before the White House did. Consisting of sculptural pieces made of resin, brass, and frosted glass, Bole's designs are modeled after John Haviland's original design for the plumbing at Eastern State Penitentiary. The exhibit includes views of the plumbing from <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> of those residing or working at the prison, including that of the prisoners, prison guards, and the manufacturers of the plumbing. Additionally, the exhibit showcases the sculptures as having both opaque and translucent factors, in which the translucent parts will glow within the cells.|$|E
500|$|To {{achieve the}} point-of-view of a rolling bowling ball the Coen {{brothers}} mounted a camera [...] "on {{something like a}} barbecue spit", according to Ethan, and then dollied it along the lane.

[...] He did grant, however, that [...] "Soul Singing" [...] and [...] "Miracle to Me" [...] were written with Hudson in mind, and explained that the album's track order roughly follows a path from confusion to clarity that mirrored his own. [...] Producer Don Was said of Chris, [...] "I realized he was taking on something that was significant. [...] He was writing about becoming a man... There's {{a lot of old}} man/young man symbolism that's a self-conversation... I don't know that anyone has actually chronicled being 33 [...] as well as this album." ...|$|E
500|$|The Sydney Cove {{panorama}} on the Museum punchbowl is dated between 1812 and 1818. <b>The</b> <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> is {{from beneath}} Dawes Point, shown with its flagstaff {{and before the}} Dawes Point fortifications built 1818–1821 ⑦. Looking directly into Campbell's Cove, the immediate focal points are Robert Campbell's warehouse and the [...] "Wharf House" [...] roof of his residence ⑥. To the right of Campbell's Wharf are extensive stone walls marking boundaries between properties {{in this part of}} the Rocks district ⑧. First Government House can be seen at the head of Sydney Cove in the distance ② and around the eastern shore a small rendition of Billy Blue's 1812-house ①. The Governor and civil personnel lived on the more orderly eastern slopes of the Tank Stream, compared to the disorderly western side where convicts lived. The Tank Stream was the fresh water course emptying into Sydney Cove and supplied the fledgling colony until 1826. Further along is Bennelong Point – with no sign of Fort Macquarie built from December 1817 – and Garden Island – the colony's first food source. The distant vista of the eastern side of the Harbour goes almost as far as the Macquarie Lighthouse – Australia's first lighthouse – [...] built between 1816 and 1818 on South Head. There are seven sailing ships flying the white ensign of the British Royal Navy in the Harbour, along with three sailboats and two canoes.|$|E
500|$|Allward {{constructed}} the memorial on <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> of Hill 145, {{the highest point}} on the ridge. The memorial contains many stylized features, including 20 human figures, which help the viewer in contemplating the structure as a whole. The front wall, normally mistaken for the rear, is [...] high and represents an impenetrable wall of defence. There {{is a group of}} figures {{at each end of the}} front wall, next to the base of the steps. The Breaking of the Sword is located at the southern corner of the front wall while Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless is located at the northern corner. Collectively, the two groups are The Defenders and represent the ideals for which Canadians gave their lives during the war. There is a cannon barrel draped in laurel and olive branches carved into the wall above each group, to symbolize victory and peace. In Breaking of the Sword, three young men are present, one of whom is crouching and breaking his sword. This statue represents the defeat of militarism and the general desire for peace. This grouping of figures is the most overt image to pacifism in the monument, the breaking of a sword being extremely uncommon in war memorials. The original plan for the sculpture included one figure crushing a German helmet with his foot. It was later decided to dismiss this feature because of its overtly militaristic imagery. In Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless, one man stands erect while three other figures, stricken by hunger or disease, are crouched and kneeling around him. The standing man represents Canada's sympathy for the weak and oppressed.|$|E
50|$|This is {{especially}} supported {{by studying the}} incommensurability of theories. For example, consider Newtonian mechanics and relativistic mechanics. From a strict <b>vantage</b> <b>point,</b> in newtonian mechanics mass and energy are always conserved, where in relativistc mechanics energy and mass are always interchangeable. (Note the difference between <b>the</b> strict <b>vantage</b> <b>point,</b> and <b>the</b> layperson's <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> that Newton's theory is applicable at low energies and low velocities relative to the velocity of light.) Because the theories are completely incompatible, scientists using one paradigm {{will not be able}} to discuss meaningfully with scientists from the other paradigm.|$|R

500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I think even its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E
