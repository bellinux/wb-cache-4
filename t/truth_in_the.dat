5|$|In November 1934, Butler {{told the}} {{committee}} that one Gerald P. MacGuire told him {{that a group of}} businessmen, supposedly backed by a private army of 500,000 ex-soldiers and others, intended to establish a fascist dictatorship. Butler had been asked to lead it, he said, by MacGuire, who was a bond salesman with Grayson M–P Murphy & Co. The New York Times reported that Butler had told friends that General Hugh S. Johnson, former head of the National Recovery Administration, was to be installed as dictator, and that the J.P. Morgan banking firm was behind the plot. Butler told Congress that MacGuire had told him the attempted coup was backed by three million dollars, and that the 500,000 men were probably to be assembled in Washington, D.C. the following year. All the parties alleged to be involved publicly said there was no <b>truth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story, calling it a joke and a fantasy.|$|E
5|$|Once in Ravenna, Helmichis and Rosamund rapidly became estranged. According to Paul, Longinus persuaded Rosamund {{to get rid}} of {{her husband}} so that he could marry her. To {{accomplish}} this, she made him drink a cup full of poison; before dying, however, Helmichis understood what his wife had done and forced her to drink the cup too, so they both died. According to Wolfram, there may be some historical <b>truth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> account of Longinus' proposal to Rosamund, as it was possible to achieve Lombard kingship by marrying the queen, but the story of the two lovers' end is not historical but legendary. The mutual murder as told by Agnellus is given a different interpretation by Joaquin Martinez Pizarro: he sees Helmichis' last action as a symbol of how the natural hierarchy of sexes is at last restored, after the queen's actions had unnaturally modified the proper equilibrium.|$|E

5|$|Kisuke's {{story begins}} with him {{suffering}} amnesia {{and on the}} run from his former ninja comrades. Returning to Edo to discover the <b>truth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company of Yuzuruha, he accidentally breaks an ancient seal keeping damned souls at bay. Defeating the monsters they manifest as, he learns from his mollified ninja companions and their employer Yukinojo that he was part of a mission to steal the Kuzuryu Demon Blade from Momohime's Nakurami Clan and punish them for defying the shogun's order to surrender it, which in turn was tied in with Yukinojo's intentions in marrying Momohime. Yukinojo sends Kisuke against Torahime, Momohime's sister and the shrine maiden in charge of keeping the Kuzuryu's power in check. Pursuing her, Kisuke fights both Torahime and undead soldiers loyal to her family. In pursuit of her, he faces agents who are preserving the flow of magic energy to Mount Fuji, including a young Yamabushi. His battles awaken his memories: he was originally disguised as a servant in Torahime's household as part of Yukinojo's scheme to destroy her family, but fell in love with Torahime and attempted to betray his ninja comrades when stealing the Kuzuryu. Dying from his wounds, the spirit of Senju Oboroya, the creator of the Oboro Style that controls the Demon Blades, fused with Kisuke to save his life and pass on the Oboro Style to someone who would use it for good. The fusion triggered Kisuke's amnesia, but left him with the ability to wield Demon Blades without succumbing to their evil.|$|E

25|$|Logic is {{concerned}} with the patterns in reason that can help tell us if a proposition is true or not. However, logic does not deal with <b>truth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absolute sense, as for instance a metaphysician does.

25|$|The Transcendentalists {{emphasised}} an intuitive, experiential {{approach of}} religion.

40|$|Abstract. An argumentation {{system that}} allows {{temporal}} reasoning using the notions of instant and interval is presented. Previous proposals just considered either instants or intervals. A many-sorted logic is used to represent temporal knowledge at the monotonic level. The logic considers how to formalize knowledge about explicit temporal references, events, properties and actions. The argumentation system provides a non-monotonic layer in which to reason about <b>the</b> justification of <b>truths</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system. The proposal is illustrated showing how to solve well-known problems of the literature...|$|R

50|$|From a Hindu {{point of}} view, the whole Universe is being brought into {{existence}} as {{the manifestation of}} the dance of the Supreme Dancer, Nataraja. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Hindu scriptures every god {{has his or her}} own style (lasya and tandava respectively represent two aspects of dance).

25|$|The {{discovery}} of the non-Euclidean geometries had a ripple effect which went far {{beyond the boundaries of}} mathematics and science. The philosopher Immanuel Kant's treatment of human knowledge had a special role for geometry. It was his prime example of synthetic a priori knowledge; not derived from the senses nor deduced through logic— our knowledge of space was a truth that we were born with. Unfortunately for Kant, his concept of this unalterably true geometry was Euclidean. Theology was also affected by the change from absolute truth to relative <b>truth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way that mathematics is related to the world around it, that was a result of this paradigm shift.|$|E
25|$|In {{fact the}} essence of her art was refinement. The term seems odd for a {{performer}} whose imagination and means of expression were so prodigious. She was eminently capable of the grand gesture; still, judging strictly from the evidence of her recordings, we know (and her few existing film clips confirm) that her power flowed not from excess but from unbroken concentration, unfaltering <b>truth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moment. It flowed also from irreproachable musicianship. People say that Callas would not hesitate to distort a vocal line for dramatic effect. In the throes of operatic passion plenty of singers snarl, growl, whine, and shriek. Callas {{was not one of}} them. She found all she needed in the notes.|$|E
25|$|Indra is praised as {{the highest}} god in 250 hymns of the Rigveda – a Hindu scripture dated to have been {{composed}} sometime between 1700 and 1100 BCE. He is co-praised as the supreme in another 50 hymns, thus making {{him one of the}} most celebrated Vedic deities. He is also mentioned in ancient Indo-Iranian literature, but with a major inconsistency when contrasted with the Vedas. In the Vedic literature, Indra is a heroic god. In the Avestan (ancient, pre-Islamic Iranian) texts such as Vd. 10.9, Dk. 9.3 and Gbd 27.6-34.27, Indra – or accurately Andra – is a gigantic demon who opposes <b>truth.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Vedic texts, Indra kills the archenemy and demon Vritra who threatens mankind.

25|$|The {{principal}} results {{which were}} {{expected from the}} exploration of the Mekong may be summed up in a few words. It was desired, first, that the old maps should be rectified, and the navigability of the river tried, it being our hope that we might bind together French Cochin-China and the western provinces of China by means of it. Were the rapids, of whose existence we knew, an absolute barrier? Were the islands of Khon an impassable difficulty? Was there any <b>truth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opinion of geographers who, believed that there was a communication between the Meïnam and the Mekong?

25|$|At Hines Corners, {{there is}} a plaque commemorating the {{founding}} of the original Village of Hine's Corners by David and Merritt Hine. The plaque was placed there on August 9, 1925, by descendants of the Hine family. Interestingly, it states that the Hines founded the community in 1811, while historical sources (all of which were published before the erection of the plaque) put the founding date at either 1831 or 1840 instead. However, these sources also offer a possible solution: both note that the younger Hine came from Connecticut (or Massachusetts) in 1811 (or 1810), and say that he came first to the nearby Village of Ararat in Ararat Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. It is possible that family lore may have diverged from the <b>truth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intervening century between Hine's Corners' founding and the plaque's erection.|$|E
