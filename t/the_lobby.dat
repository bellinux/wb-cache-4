40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> power of different interest groups and public education spending in a panel data estimation during the period 1996 - 2009 for 132 countries. The resource rents, manufacture exports, and agriculture value added are used as proxy variables for <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> power of <b>the</b> natural resource owners, manufacturers, and landowners, respectively, in order to substantiate the definition of <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> power of <b>the</b> interest groups more with economic fundamentals. As lobbying power is mediated through political institutions, different governance indicators are used individually and in interaction terms with the proxy variables in the estimations. It is found that when the country is more politically stable and the more {{the rule of law}} applies, the negative (positive) effect of <b>the</b> <b>lobbying</b> power of natural resource owners (manufacturers) on public education spending intensifies. The negative effect of landowners’ lobbying power diminishes as institutional quality as measured by governance indicators improves. </span...|$|R
