The time between a film's debut and its selection varies greatly. The longest span is 121years; Edison Kinetographic Record of a Sneeze was originally released in 1894 and selected for preservation in 2015.

5|$|In 1804, Clarkson {{resumed his}} work and the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade began meeting again, {{strengthened}} with prominent new members such as Zachary Macaulay, Henry Brougham and James Stephen. In June 1804, Wilberforce's bill to abolish the slave trade successfully passed all its stages through the House of Commons. However, {{it was too late}} in the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the House of Lords. On its reintroduction during the 1805 session, it was defeated, with even the usually sympathetic Pitt failing to support it. On this occasion and throughout the campaign, abolition was held back by Wilberforce's trusting, even credulous nature, and his deferential attitude towards those in power. He found it difficult to believe that men of rank would not do what he perceived to be <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing,</b> and was reluctant to confront them when they did not.|$|E

However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira {{to return to the}} Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to give himself over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna hands over his weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may come to understand why this was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do someday.|$|E

Although real-time-rendered, three-dimensional computer animation (machinima) {{had been used in}} earlier political films, The French Democracy attained an unprecedented level of mainstream attention for political machinima. While acknowledging the film's flaws, such as the grammatically poor English subtitles, commentators praised its clear political message and compared it to films such as La Haine and Do <b>the</b> <b>Right</b> <b>Thing.</b> The French Democracy inspired other politically conscious machinima works and fueled discussion about the art form's potential for political expression. Some raised concerns that video game companies would use their copyrights to control the content of derivative machinima films.|$|E

5|$|The plot of Arrested Development {{revolves}} around {{the members of the}} Bluth family, a formerly-wealthy family who continue to lead extravagant lifestyles despite their changed circumstances and who often find themselves drawn into interactions with incestuous undertones. At the center of the show is Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman), the show's straight man, who strives to do <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> and keep his family together, despite their materialism, selfishness, and manipulative natures. Michael is a widowed single father. His teenage son, George Michael (Michael Cera), has the same qualities of decency but feels a constant pressure {{to live up to his}} father's expectations and is often reluctant to follow his father's plans.

A few days later, however, Harry wears Chuckie down and convinces his son to shoot him {{to death with a}} handgun. When Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) investigate, Chuckie claims Harry shot himself, which Lewis does not believe. Felton talks to Chuckie at the police station and Chuckie admits to the assisted suicide, but Felton tells him to stick to the original suicide story. Lewis realizes what happened and confronts Felton, who admits what Chuckie did and suggests it was <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do, but Lewis adamantly disagrees. Since the bullet evidence is inconclusive, Felton asks Lewis to let Chuckie secretly wash his hands so no gunpowder residue will be found in tests. Lewis initially refuses, but he eventually reluctantly agrees, allowing Chuckie to get away with the shooting.|$|E

Meanwhile, Mac suggests to Sue that she finds someone else to love. Caroline confronts Mac about marrying her. Mac defends himself by saying it would be better for her to marry Guy because he will live longer. Guy later decides to do <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing,</b> and tells Mac to propose to Caroline because they love each other. Caroline and Mac therefore become engaged and later marry, where the majority of the core cast are in attendance. At the wedding, Sue is seen with a new boyfriend.

The Crawley's are uneasy about agreeing to surgery, but Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) convinces them that it is <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to do.
