25|$|The NTSB {{found that}} there was a fatigue crack in the power control module, and that it was not {{possible}} to visually inspect that <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> The lower rudder control module's cast metal housing had broken. The end portion of the control module housing which housed the yaw damper actuator had separated from the main portion of the housing. Deforge said in the Mayday episode that the NW85 failure was an unusual failure since most failures are of internal components rather than the housing itself.|$|E
25|$|Overheating of {{internal}} parts, such as control grids or mica spacer insulators, {{can result in}} trapped gas escaping into the tube; this can reduce performance. A getter is used to absorb gases evolved during tube operation, but has only a limited ability to combine with gas. Control of the envelope temperature prevents some types of gassing. A tube with an unusually high level {{of internal}} gas may exhibit a visible blue glow when plate voltage is applied. The getter (being a highly reactive metal) is effective against many atmospheric gases, but has no (or very limited) chemical reactivity to inert gases such as helium. One progressive <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure,</b> especially with physically large envelopes such as those used by camera tubes and cathode-ray tubes, comes from helium infiltration. The exact mechanism is not clear: the metal-to-glass lead-in seals are one possible infiltration site.|$|E
30|$|Considering the {{significant}} impact <b>of</b> dependent <b>failures</b> (CCF and cascading <b>failure)</b> on reliability <b>of</b> redundant systems, these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>failures</b> substantially affect MTBF of such systems. Neglecting {{the role that}} these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>failures</b> play may result in significantly misleading MTBF evaluation models which in turn lead to incorrect MTBF value. Therefore, this paper addresses these two important <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>failures</b> and incorporates those into a proposed model for MTBF evaluation of a 2 -out-of- 3 repairable redundant system.|$|R

500|$|Touchscreen control {{components}} on iPhone 6 logic boards have insufficient support, including {{a lack of}} underfill—which strengthens and stabilizes integrated circuits, {{and a lack of}} rigid metal shielding on the logic board unlike previous iPhone models; the touchscreen controller is instead shielded by a flexible [...] "sticker". Normal use of the device can cause the logic board to flex internally, which strains the touchscreen IC connectors and leads to a degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality. A symptom that has been associated with this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> is a flickering grey bar {{near the top of the}} display. iFixit reported that this issue, nicknamed [...] "touch disease", was a byproduct of the previous [...] "Bendgate" [...] design flaw because of the device's demonstrated lack of rigidity. As such, the larger iPhone 6 Plus is more susceptible to the flaw, but it has also been reported on a small percentage of iPhone 6 models. The devices' successor, the iPhone 6S, is not afflicted by this flaw due to changes to their internal design, which included the strengthening of [...] "key points" [...] in the rear casing, and the re-location of the touchscreen controllers to the display assembly from the logic board.|$|E
2500|$|Taxpayers {{who fail}} to file returns, file late, or file returns that are wrong, {{may be subject to}} {{penalties}}. [...] These penalties vary based on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> [...] Some penalties are computed like interest, some are fixed amounts, and some are based on other measures. [...] Penalties for filing or paying late are generally based on the amount of tax that should have been paid and the degree of lateness. [...] Penalties for failures related to certain forms are fixed amounts, and vary by form from very small to huge.|$|E
2500|$|The actual {{timing of}} these impulses {{had to be}} {{adjusted}} to coincide with a [...] "safe" [...] period, when the blades of the propeller were well out of the way, and this adjustment had to be checked at intervals, especially if the propeller was changed or refitted, as well as after a major engine overhaul. Faults in this adjustment (or, say, a cam wheel slipping a millimetre or two, or a pushrod flexing) could well result in every bullet fired hitting the propeller – [...] a worse result than if the gun was fired through the propeller with no control at all. The other main <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> involved {{a break in the}} stream of firing impulses, usually due to the generator or linkages either jamming or breaking (or, indeed, disintegrating). This simply meant the gun no longer fired, and was a common cause of synchronized guns [...] "jamming".|$|E

2500|$|Clinical {{psychologist}} Stephen Briers {{questions the}} value of the NLP maxim—a presupposition in NLP jargon—"there is no failure, only feedback". [...] Briers argues that the denial of the existence of failure diminishes its instructive value. He offers Walt Disney, Isaac Newton and J.K. Rowling as three examples of unambiguous acknowledged personal failure that served as an impetus to great success. According to Briers, it was [...] "the crash-and-burn <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure,</b> not the sanitised NLP Failure Lite, i.e. the failure-that-isn't really-failure sort of failure" [...] that propelled these individuals to success. Briers contends that adherence to the maxim leads to self-deprecation. According to Briers, personal endeavour is a product of invested values and aspirations and the dismissal of personally significant failure as mere feedback effectively denigrates what one values. Briers writes, [...] "Sometimes we need to accept and mourn the death of our dreams, not just casually dismiss them as inconsequential. NLP's reframe casts us into the role of a widower avoiding the pain of grief by leap-frogging into a rebound relationship with a younger woman, never pausing to say a proper goodbye to his dead wife." [...] Briers also contends that the NLP maxim is narcissistic, self-centered and divorced from notions of moral responsibility.|$|E
5000|$|The fourth <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> is {{from the}} use of {{defective}} materials.  This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> is also unpredictable, since the material may have been improperly manufactured or damaged from prior use.|$|E

30|$|Ruiz et al. [393] use a BN to {{localize}} {{and identify the}} most probable cause <b>of</b> two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>failures,</b> the tight filtering and inter-channel interference, in optical networks. They discretize the continuous real-valued features of Quality of Transmission (QoT), such as received power and pre-forward error correction bit error rate (pre-FEC BER) for categories. The authors use these categories and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>failures</b> to train the BN, which can identify the root cause <b>of</b> the <b>failure</b> at the optical layer when a service experiences excessive errors.

40|$|Machinery {{infrastructure}} is usually prone to stoppage due to unexpected breakdowns. This paper analyzes possible <b>failures</b> root causes <b>of</b> manufacturing facilities, including machinery, {{to improve their}} performance. The research methodology utilizes a fact-driven statistical approach to investigate the statistical relationships between different affecting factors. These include <b>failure</b> modes, durations <b>of</b> downtime, working shifts, and products. Experimental designs models were employed in this paper, based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test and the Kruskal-Wallis test in combination with Tukey’s method for pairwise comparisons. ANOVA analysis identifies different downtime durations influenced by different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>failures.</b> Similarly, the Kruskal-Wallis test results show that downtime durations are affected by different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>failures</b> and not affected by different products and production lines. A case study was done on a dairy plant in Saudi Arabia where ten <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>failures</b> were identified. The results showed the top ranked failures to be finished product clearance, setup delay, raw material rejection, mechanical failure, and electrical failure. The findings help the management to develop learned lessons that help to minimize the cost and consequences <b>of</b> having frequent <b>failures...</b>|$|R
