50|$|A general {{election}} is held every year, usually in September, to elect representatives to MPP. The percentage of voter <b>turn-outs</b> are usually high (70 to 95 percent) {{largely due to}} enforcements from the universities' management which, at the same time, acts as the Election Committee.|$|R
25|$|Siding {{with the}} city, FairVote Minnesota stated that instant-runoff voting (IRV) {{is a form}} of RCV that allowed voters to rank {{multiple}} candidates on a single ballot. They argued that this form of voting had legitimate policy reasons such as simplifying the election process, saving money, increasing voter <b>turn-out,</b> ensuring more diverse representation, and promoting civil election campaigns.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the {{existence}} of Fermanagh and South Tyrone, {{there has been a}} rough balance between unionist and nationalist voters, though in recent years the nationalists have had a slight majority. Many elections have seen a candidate from one community triumph due to multiple candidates from the other community splitting the vote. Perhaps because of this balance between the communities, Fermanagh and South Tyrone has repeatedly had the highest <b>turn-out</b> of any constituency in Northern Ireland.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, Thiệu ran for re-election, but his {{reputation}} for corruption made his political opponents believe the poll would be rigged, and they declined to run. As the only candidate, Thiệu was thus easily re-elected, receiving 94% of the vote on an 87% <b>turn-out,</b> a figure widely held to be fraudulent. The signing of the Paris Peace Accords in January 1973 failed to end the fighting in South Vietnam, as North Vietnam immediately violated the cease-fire and attempted to make territorial gains, resulting in large battles.|$|E

The NFTA purchased 12 Presidents' Conference Committee (PCC) streetcars in the 1980s {{to serve the}} Tonawanda <b>turn-out,</b> a proposed Metro Rail extension to Tonawanda and North Tonawanda. These cars were built by the St. Louis Car Company and acquired by Cleveland, Ohio's Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority second-hand in 1953.

The PCCs were sold to the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association (BHRA) and scrapped in 2003 when the BHRA folded.|$|E
