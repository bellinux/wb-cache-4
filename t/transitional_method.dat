5000|$|Another {{component}} of American identity that Huntington sees as under attack {{is the use}} of English. Up until the late 20th century, English has been the dominant language of America and was actively taught to immigrants. This was not only because Americans throughout history had spoken this language, but also because, with a variety of languages brought by different immigrant groups to the United States, teaching everyone to learn to speak and write English ensured communication among these groups. This tradition was inadvertently undermined by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibited {{discrimination on the basis of}} [...] "national origin". The act was interpreted to mean that potential voters who did not speak English were entitled to assistance under this [...] "national origin" [...] clause so that they would not be disadvantaged. This led to bilingual voting ballots and the beginning of bilingual education. In 1974, the Civil Rights Act [...] "was amended to require schools to provide instruction in a student's native language and culture 'to the extent necessary to allow the child to progress effectively through the education system. However, Huntington states that the result was, as stated by 1985 Secretary of Education William Bennett, that the program became:a way of enhancing students' knowledge of their native language and culture. Bilingual education was no longer seen so much as a means to ensure that students learned English, or as a <b>transitional</b> <b>method</b> until students learned English. Rather, it became an emblem of cultural pride, a means of producing a positive self-image in the student.Finally, the single most imposing challenge to America, in Huntington's view, is the problem of Mexican immigration and the resulting [...] "Hispanization" [...] of those regions of the United States adjacent to and acquired from Mexico.

The Hindsville quarry {{located in the}} northeastern portion of Washington County in Arkansas {{is the focus of}} this study. The objective {{of this study is to}} characterize the Reeds Spring at the Hindsville Quarry. The use of terrestrial light detecting and ranging(LiDAR) is used to assist in the characterization of the quarry. The unit architecture within the Hindsville Quarry outlines varying transitional periods that give insight into the deposition of the Reeds Springs Formation. There are comparable formations within the Carboniferous that serve as helpful analogues in explaining the complexities seen in the Hindsville Quarry. Diffusive process (turbidity currents or debris flows) and physical energy flux (winds, waves, and storms) played a large part in defining the sedimentary structures found within the Hindsville Quarry. These mechanisms in depositional process demonstrate that the use of sub aerial exposures are not needed to explain erosive surfaces. Terrestrial LiDAR is used to identify stratigraphic pattern, bedding planes, and determine the orientation of inaccessible quarry walls. The effects of distance and incidence angle, resolution of the scan, and the ability to discriminate varying lithologies played a role in the assessment of the geologic outcrops.

40|$|Abstract: One {{possible}} direction toward {{better understanding}} {{the human condition}} may be developing clear definitions of basic ideas. Connecting parts and wholes, as suggested by Spinoza, implies {{moving back and forth}} between concrete instances and abstract concepts to enrich our understanding of both particulars and concepts. Perhaps it can also serve as a <b>transitional</b> <b>method</b> between descriptive and systematic studies. The advantage of the part/whole method is illustrated by my difficulties in giving the concept of normalization its rightful part of labeling theory. Most studies focus on either parts or wholes. However, some studies are described that balance between them. The purpose of both art and science is innovation. Given the state of the world, creativity and innovation seem especially needed in trying to understand human beings and their conduct. One of many difficulties is that better or fuller understanding in this arena usually challenges implicit theories that are simply assumed with little or no thought.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the harmonic extension problem, which is widely used in many applications of machine learning. We find that the <b>transitional</b> <b>method</b> of graph Laplacian fails to produce a good approximation of the classical harmonic function. To tackle this problem, we propose a new method called the point integral method (PIM). We consider the harmonic extension problem {{from the point of}} view of solving PDEs on manifolds. The basic idea of the PIM method is to approximate the harmonicity using an integral equation, which is easy to be discretized from points. Based on the integral equation, we explain the reason why the transitional graph Laplacian may fail to approximate the harmonicity in the classical sense and propose a different approach which we call the volume constraint method (VCM). Theoretically, both the PIM and the VCM computes a harmonic function with convergence guarantees, and practically, they are both simple, which amount to solve a linear system. One important application of the harmonic extension in machine learning is semi-supervised learning. We run a popular semi-supervised learning algorithm by Zhu et al. over a couple of well-known datasets and compare the performance of the aforementioned approaches. Our experiments show the PIM performs the best. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

However, determining the progression rate of unobservable diseases is challenging. Neuropsychological evaluations are often the primary variables used in identifying stage of disease severity. Although these variables provide a good indication of disease severity, they are not considered to be 2 ̆ 2 gold standard 2 ̆ 2 for measuring the stage of disease and may be misclassifying the true stage of disease. This research proposes examine the dynamics characteristics of disease as it changes over time. Several approaches exist to examine misclassification in longitudinal studies where the outcome is binary, in both continuous and discrete time settings. When the outcome has more than two categories, hidden Markov models have been used to investigate misclassification but with discrete time. We have developed a likelihood based procedure that describes the dynamic characteristics of change over time in disease severity and allows for possible misclassification of stage of disease based on surrogate variables. We have shown the severe implications of using conventional <b>transitional</b> <b>methods</b> when the data is truly misclassified. The methodology that was developed has several valuable implications. First, the ability to model the severity of diseases is necessary in designing treatment plans which better manage the disease as well as drug and behavior intervention studies that aim to prevent onset or progression of diseases. Second, identifying stages of severity of disease will allow researchers to measure disease progression and obtain sensitivity and specificity of neuropsychological variables on true disease severity. Third, the ideas in this proposed research can be applied to other longitudinal studies where the stage of disease is difficult to measure, such as Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease and Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease. ...|$|R
40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the pressure-gain {{combustion}} engine are investigated analytically and experimentally in the current study. A lumped parameter model is developed to characterize the operation of a valveless pulse detonation engine. The model identified the function of flame quenching process through gas dynamic process. By adjusting fuel manifold pressure and geometries, {{the duration of the}} air buffer can be effectively varied. The parametric study with the lumped parameter model has shown that engine frequency of up to approximately 15 Hz is attainable. However, requirements for upstream air pressure increases significantly with higher engine frequency. The higher pressure requirement indicates pressure loss in the system and lower overall engine performance. ^ The loss of performance due to the pressure loss is a critical issue for the integrated pressure-gain combustors. Two types of <b>transitional</b> <b>methods</b> are examined using entropy-based models. An accumulator based transition has obvious loss due to sudden area expansion, but it can be minimized by utilizing the gas dynamics in the combustion tube. An ejector type transition has potential to achieve performance beyond the limit specified by a single flow path Humphrey cycle. The performance of an ejector was discussed in terms of apparent entropy and mixed flow entropy. Through an ideal ejector, the apparent part of entropy increases due to the reduction in flow unsteadiness, but entropy of the mixed flow remains constant. The method is applied to a CFD simulation with a simple manifold for qualitative evaluation. ^ The operation of the wave rotor constant volume combustion rig is experimentally examined. The rig has shown versatility of operation for wide range of conditions. Large pressure rise in the rotor channel and in a section of the exhaust duct are observed even with relatively large leakage gaps on the rotor. The simplified analysis indicated that inconsistent combustion is likely due to insufficient fuel near the ignition source. However, it is difficult to conclude its fuel distribution with the current setup. Additional measurement near the rotor interfaces and better fuel control are required for the future test. ...|$|R
40|$|Two main {{sources of}} high losses in small axial {{turbines}} are the tip leakage loss and the Reynolds number related loss. The extents of these losses {{are directly related to}} blade geometry. Due to limitation in manufacturing capabilities and the prohibitive cost of precision engineering often the manufactured blade {{is very different from the}} design or the ideal blade shape and as a result the component efficiency degrades. Reynolds number effect plays a very important role in the low efficiency of small axial turbines. The effect of low Reynolds number is essentially separation of the flow resulting in high losses. Unlike in large turbines, where the Reynolds number is above 10 e 5, depending on size the Reynolds number over which a small turbine operates can be as low as 10 e 4. At this range the flow is laminar over a large extent of the blade and is very susceptible to laminar separation resulting in high losses. Since due to the aerodynamics this is inevitable, the only resort for an engineer is to design a blade that will delay separation to a point which will either result in turbulent separation or a transitional-laminar separation resulting in a smaller separation bubble. The design of such blades requires in depth knowledge on the field of flow <b>transitional</b> <b>methods.</b> An existing flow transition model has been implemented with simple modifications for separated flow in an in-house CFD code. Once validated against available experimental data, a parametric study has been conducted, where the effects of Reynolds number, velocity ratio, the turbulence levels and the location of maximum loading has been tested on a simulated turbine flow. Two different velocity distributions were tested. The combined results provided an understanding of the aerodynamic behaviour of small low Reynolds number axial turbine blades and provided a basis of better blade design.

Such <b>methods</b> can be designed in the context of casual workplace domains, distributed workgroups, and everyday public spaces. Situated Intera [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Wireless network {{localization}} using Radio Signal Strength (RSS) {{is considered}} a classical option in many scenarios because of its convenience and economic feasibility. However, this localization method is easily affected by various influences, such as unknown radio path loss factors, multi-path effects, hardware discrepancies, antenna orientation, and so forth. Among these, multi-path effects {{have a profound effect}} on uni-channel RSS measurements in the “microscale”, defined as a small region within the range of several wavelengths of the radio signal and thus degrade to the accuracy of <b>transitional</b> localization <b>methods</b> based on uni-channel fingerprinting. In response to the above limitation, this thesis introduces Harnessing Constructive Interference (HCI), a system for indoor positioning using the phenomenon of constructive interference. The key observation behind the HCI is that peak RSS measurements in the frequency domain, which are results of the constructive interference, feature a relatively small dynamic range. Utilizing this observation, we propose the HCI design to improve the performance of the location estimate. In addition, we provided three profiling methods: symmetric, asymmetric with Spline interpolation and Whittaker- Shannon interpolation to reduce the system overhead. To evaluate, the proposed designs have been implemented on the NU platform and experiments were carried out with 56 sampling positions, 5 anchor nodes, and a collective number of 1, 447, 800 RSS measurements. By comparing with a representative algorithms, e. g., RADAR [2], it is shown that the proposed HCI system significantly reduces localization errors. Adviser: Ziguo Zhon...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{the results}} of a Raman {{campaign}} for studying seventeenth-century Sicilian frescoes, by using two portable Raman systems, equipped with different excitation sources (785 and 1064  nm), are proposed. The measurements were performed with the aim to provide an in situ diagnostic analysis of the wall paintings (in terms of colorants and preparation layer) and to support the conservators in the framework of the ongoing restoration. The combined use of the two Raman spectrometers has given a complete overview on the artist palette and on the state of preservation of frescoes, also informing us about the technique employed by the painter. Natural pigments as hematite, vermillion, goethite, lead red, lead white and carbon-based black pigments have been identified. Additionally, the application of a <b>transitional</b> Romanesque–Renaissance frescoes <b>method</b> has been noticed by the systematic combined presence of calcite and gypsum in the substrate. Finally, the analyses have highlighted the presence of degradation products, mainly related to alteration of lead-based pigments...|$|R
