40|$|This {{project is}} {{an outcome of}} the {{postgraduate}} diploma course on Project evaluation, CESPROMIN, for the year 2008 - 09, one of the CESMAT cycles {{in the frame of}} MINES ParisTech. The objective of this project was to understand the methods of Economic Evaluation of a Mining Project, which includes the selection of Mining method & Reserve estimation & Financial Assessment. To present my understanding on Mine Economics & impact of different parameters of Project Finance, as a part of Final report for the CESPROMIN Course, I have tried to do the Economic Evaluation of Bulghah North Gold Mine, which is still in conceptual stage. From the limited data available, I with the help of Dr. Isabelle Thenevin tried to run Whittle software to optimize the Pit but due to improper block model I could not succeed in optimizing the Pit. The reason for that is the project is still geological evaluation stage, under the consultant engaged for the purpose. The Project evaluation has been done in three options. Option I &II with stripping ratio 1. 4 t/ m 3 and option III with stripping ratio 1. 7 t/m 3 at Cut-off grade 0. 3 g/t.

The treated ore was processed for 0. 5  s at 10. 5  kW {{in a single}} mode microwave cavity in batches of 1  kg. The ore selected for microwave treatment was a sample from a <b>tertiary</b> <b>crusher</b> product stream feed to a rod mill.

The microwave treated ore showed {{a significant increase in}} the amount of liberated copper minerals in the relatively coarse particle size range (106 to 300  μm). Similar significant shifts in the liberation spectra were noted for all the minerals in the ore.

40|$|Cone crushers are {{the most}} {{frequently}} used crusher type for hard rock materials in secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>crushing</b> stages in the aggregate, mineral and mining industry. Hence, knowledge about the crushing process in these machines is of great interest in order to develop and optimise the overall process. In this paper the Discrete Element Method (DEM) together with a Bonded Particle Model (BPM) are used for simulating the dynamic interaction between the rock material and the crusher. The particle flow behaviour is visualised and machine parameters are evaluated regarding their impact on process performance parameters such as capacity, flow behaviour and breakage rate. The advantages and disadvantages of using DEM with a BPM model is also investigated and compared to other strategies stated in the literature. A Sandvik CH 430 Hydrocone cone crusher is chosen for the study and parameters such as close side setting, eccentric speed and chamber design are investigated. Results are compared to simulations and empirical data from previous work by Evertsson (2000) and show a good correlation regarding capacity, breakage behaviour and breakage modes...|$|R

40|$|Austenitic Manganese steel {{has a high}} toughness, high ductility, high strain {{hardening}} capacity and an excellent wear resistance. This grade of steel is mostly used in the mining industry for crushing and loading equipment. The present paper highlights the challenges {{and the development of}} high manganese steel casting based on the service life. Currently the challenge faced among others is the rate of work hardening, which is due to the crushing efficiency of the modern jaw and cone crushers. This limits the rate of work hardening produced {{on the surface of the}} metal thus resulting in low wear resistance, loss of material and cost of production for secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>crushing</b> equipment. Due to this challenge faced, researchers were motivated to come up with innovative ideas and new development that will increase the hardness and wear resistance of the said steel, resulting in longer service life of the components. These developments include the introduction of a new heat treatment procedure, the addition of micro alloying with Chromium and the use of metal matrix composite on manganese steel casting. However, the introduction of these new developments on high manganese steel casting showed to have a direct increase in wear life and hardness of the steel...|$|R
40|$|MSc (Occupational Hygiene), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{iron ore}} mining {{industry}} {{makes use of}} various processes that result in the release of airborne dust into the surrounding atmosphere where workers are exposed, to produce a final product. The deposition in the lung and toxicological influences of airborne dust can be determined by their physical- and chemical characteristics. The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) regulations for hazardous chemical substances have no current system of how the physical- and chemical properties of particulates originating from specific areas will influence a worker‘s exposure and health, especially for ultrafine particles (UFP). It is therefore imperative to characterise airborne dust containing micrometer and UFP size particles originating from specific areas {{to determine if there}} are physical- and chemical characteristics {{that may or may not}} have an influence on the workers‘ health. Aim: This pilot study is aimed at the physical- and chemical characterisation of the airborne iron ore dust generated at the process areas of an opencast iron ore mine. Method: Sampled areas included the Primary-secondary crusher, <b>Tertiary</b> <b>crusher,</b> Quaternary crusher and Sifting house. Gravimetric sampling was conducted through the use of static inhalable- and respirable samplers in conjunction with optical- and condensation particle counters that were placed near airborne dust- emitting sources. Physical- and chemical characterisation was done with the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Results: The results found in the study indicate high mass concentration levels of inhalable dust at all four process areas, as well as high levels of respirable dust found at the primary- secondary crusher area. Particle size distribution optical particle counter (OPC) results indicate that the majority of particles at all four process areas are in the region of 0. 3 μm in size. Condensation particle counter (CPC) results integrated with OPC results indicate that at the primarysecondary and Tertiary crushers the majority of particles are found to be in the size fraction < 0. 3 μm. SEM analysis indicates that particle agglomeration largely occurs in the airborne iron ore dust. Particle splinters originating from larger particle collisions and breakages are present in the airborne dust. EDS analysis indicates that the elemental majority of the airborne iron ore dust consists of iron, oxygen, carbon, aluminium, silicon, potassium and calcium. The elemental percentages differ from each process area where an increase in iron and decrease in impurities can be seen as the ore moves through the beneficiation process from the Primary-secondary crusher to the Sifting house. Conclusion: The results obtained from the physical- and chemical properties of the airborne iron ore dust indicate high risk of over-exposure to the respiratory system, as well as possible ultrafine particle systemic exposure, that may overwhelm the physiological defense mechanisms of the human body and lead to reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and the development of pathologies such as siderosis, silicasiderosis and lung cancer.

40|$|Cone crushers are {{commonly}} used for secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>crushing</b> stages in the aggregate and mining industry. It has previously been demonstrated that the discrete element method (DEM) {{can be used to}} simulate rock breakage in crushers using a variety of modelling techniques. In order to provide confidence in the simulation results the DEM models need to be validated against experimental data. Such validation efforts are scarcely reported in the existing literature and there are no standardized procedures defined. In this paper a laboratory cone crusher is simulated using DEM and the results are compared with laboratory experiments. The rock material is modelled using the Bonded Particle Model approach calibrated against single particle breakage experiments. Two case simulations have been performed investigating the influence of eccentric speed. The laboratory crusher is a Morgårdshammar B 90 cone crusher that has been equipped with custom machined liners, variable speed drive and a National Instruments data acquisition system. The results provide novel insight regarding the stochastic flow behaviour of particles when exited by the mantle at high frequency. The estimated product size distribution matches the experimental results relatively well when evaluating the corresponding coarse region that is feasible to calculate from the DEM product discharge data...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} demand to optimise performance and profit of crushing plants. Research {{in this area}} {{has resulted in the}} development of numerous optimisation tools, and resent research has shown that the quality aspects of production have great influence on the optimisation results. The quality, cost, profit and capacity of a product is influenced by several parameters, and in order to control all of these parameters it is necessary to use some sort of optimisation software. In this paper, a novel approach use the parameters cost, profit, capacity and quality in order to perform a multi objective optimization of a crushing plant is presented. As an example a <b>tertiary</b> <b>crushing</b> stage consistent of a cone crusher and a vertical shaft impact crusher (VSI) is used as base for the designed objective function. The process has a given set of constraints that represents the conditions normal in these type of crushing applications. The first step in this paper is to identify if the range of the constraints can cause undesirable production costs when reaching for a given product property. The next step in the optimization shows how a strategy for relaxing constraint can increase overall productivity and still reach certain product properties. The conclusions made in this work are that multi objective optimization is essential when optimizing crushing plant production against multiple objectives. Relaxation of constraints can increase the overall performance of the crushing plant...|$|R
40|$|Cone crushers are {{commonly}} used in secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>crushing</b> stages in comminution circuits. A multitude of factors and variables influence the performance in terms of throughput capacity, size reduction, power draw and wear. Crushers are normally installed and operated at a fixed eccentric speed setting. By installing variable frequency drives and realtime optimization algorithms Hulthén and Evertsson {{have shown that the}} eccentric speed {{can be used as a}} variable to optimize the yield and improve the performance. However, the influence of eccentric speeds above the normal operational range has been scarcely reported on in the literature. This paper aims at reporting on the result from an exploratory study where experiments and simulations have been used to evaluate cone crusher operation at high eccentric speed levels ranging from 10 - 40 Hz. A laboratory Morgårdshammar cone crusher has been refurbished for the purpose of the study. A preliminary set of experiments have been performed where results showed that the chamber geometry has a vital importance. The same behaviour as observed in the experiments was also further understood by using DEM simulations leading to the design of a new chamber geometry. The new chamber design have been evaluated using DEM at four eccentric speeds and two different close side settings. The rock model has been calibrated by single particle breakage experiments and is based on the bonded particle model. The product particle size distribution has been estimated by image analysis of the bonded cluster discharge.

40|$|Abstract only - The {{existing}} {{construction waste}} recycling technologies and standards have been long applied in construction and demolition (C&D) waste recycling, mainly {{focused on the}} production and use of coarse recycled aggregates. Very few papers and process focus on the production of recycled sand although some previous results show that fine aggregates fraction (below 4. 8 mm) represents around 40 to 60 % (in mass) of the Brazilian waste and it is usually down cycled as road sub-base or disposed in landfills. The quality of the recycled aggregate is strictly related {{to the content of}} porous and low strength phases, as the patches of cement attached to the recycled aggregate. Despite being the crucial factor for aggregate performance, the removal of adhered cement paste is not a simple task. Some technologies have already been described in the literature, even though, to the moment none of these technologies has clearly succeeded in reaching the large market available. This paper presents a summary of the main properties of the sand produced from C&D waste by <b>tertiary</b> <b>crushing</b> at vertical shaft impactor crusher (attrition and abrasion comminution). Additionally mineral processing technologies were applied on the attained product, such as density concentration by shaking table and spirals and magnetic separation at rare earth roll separator. The main properties of recycled sand are discussed and compared to the previous C&D waste, respectively: apparent density, water absorption, chemical composition, porosity, particle shape and cement paste content. The results demonstrated that the comminution by vertical shaft impact crusher allowed producing a VSI-sand with low porosity and water absorption. The concentration by shaking table at narrow sieve fractions led to a product with low porosity and reduced content of cement paste, although products from spiral concentrator for the bulk sample had only the effect of classification instead of concentration. The non-magnetic products presented similar characteristics of the heavy product from the shaking table plus separation of micaceous minerals. The aim of producing sand from construction and demolition waste through mineral processing unit operations changes the recycling approach and contributes for upcycling the recycled sand...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Austenitic {{manganese}} steel {{has a high}} toughness, high ductility, high strain hardening capacity and excellent wear resistance, the material is mostly used in the mining industry for crushing and loading equipment. High {{manganese steel}} shows superior wear resistance when used under primary crushing system than when used under secondary and <b>tertiary</b> modes of <b>crushing.</b> This work presents the effect of vanadium content on the mechanical properties and microstructure evaluation of high manganese steel. The addition of vanadium to high manganese steels has a direct increase on the hardness and wear resistance. Impact testing for alloys containing vanadium showed low impact energies compared to the standard manganese steel. The increase in hardness and the wear resistance of the alloys was explained {{on the basis of}} vanadium carbide which had formed on the austenitic matrix. It was observed that the carbon and vanadium content will {{have an effect on the}} mechanical properties of high manganese steel alloyed with vanadium. Microstructural examination showed that the size and distribution of vanadium carbides has an effect on the mechanical properties and the wear behaviour. Therefore, this work shows that the addition of vanadium to high manganese steel will increase the hardness and wear resistance while decreasing the impact energy of high manganese steel alloyed with vanadium...|$|R
40|$|Aggregate {{quality is}} of great importance, and in this context it is {{essential}} to understand how various process parameters influence the product quality characteristics. Thus, {{there is a need for}} aggregate producers to improve their process knowledge. Research has led to an improved understanding of how different process parameters affect the outcomes of specific comminution processes. In aggregate production, breakage models are one example of such a research result. These models have been refined over the years. The breakage models that have been presented to date can accurately predict the size distribution of aggregates. On the other hand, they cannot normally predict any other material characteristics such as shape and strength. This thesis outlines the research to date, which has focused on a frequently discussed quality parameter, namely the shape of the product. Knowledge of various methodologies is required to measure this parameter. A novel method for measuring the shape of fine aggregates is presented. The rheology test, the methodology of which was originally based on a New Zealand standard, can be correlated with other data to measure particle shape in accordance with the F-aspect method. The correlation between these methods is very good, and since the rheology test is easy to use, it is suitable for a quarry or a basic test facility. The cone crusher is the most commonly used <b>tertiary</b> stage <b>crusher</b> today. One of its great advantages is that it produces a relatively low amount of fines. However, it only produces acceptable particle shapes for certain fraction sizes. The vertical shaft impact crusher (VSI) creates particles of a very satisfactory shape across all fractions, including fine aggregate, as confirmed by studies using the aforementioned rheology test. This thesis presents two models for predicting shape in crushed aggregate from a cone crusher. The first model is empirical, and my conclusion is that there are four dominating parameters affecting shape: the average feed size, the closed side setting (CSS), throw and eccentric speed. To further investigate how compressive breakage affects particle shape, an inter-particle breakage model is introduced. This model simulates a specific crushing stage inside the crusher. Simulation results show that the outcome from a crushing event can be predicted with good accuracy. A VSI model for describing particle size and shape is presented in this work. It is proposed that the dominating breakage mechanism in a VSI equipped with a rock box is of abrasive character. Abrasive breakage can appropriately shape all particle sizes, assuming the crusher is operated at a proper velocity. The empirical cone crusher model and the VSI models are combined in a mathematical simulation in order to determine how a crushing plant should be operated to maximise both yield and aggregate quality. The results show that there exists a set of rules to determine the crusher and screen settings that will achieve the best performance in terms of product yield and quality requirements...|$|R
