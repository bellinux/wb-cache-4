5|$|Carbohydrates are {{classified}} {{according to their}} glycemic index, a system for measuring how quickly a food that is eaten raises blood sugar levels, and glycemic load, which <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> both the glycemic index {{and the amount of}} carbohydrate in the food. This has led to carbohydrate counting, a method used by diabetics for planning their meals.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists often support {{use of the}} Human Development Index as a {{composite}} statistic {{in order to assess}} countries by their overall level of human development, as opposed to other measures. The HDI <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> a broad array of measures beyond monetary considerations including life expectancy, literacy, education, and standards of living for all countries worldwide.|$|E

The idea of weighting countries' votes according to their financial contribution to the organization is not unprecedented, as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other Bretton Woods institutions use this method.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} aspect of race preparation is grooming the course to provide a surface for skate-skiing and setting tracks for classic events. This <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> snow physics, methods for packing snow and surface shaping, and the equipment used for these functions. Also key is the layout of grooming and track setting in the stadium with various formats for starts, finishes and intermediate functions for relays and pursuits.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010 {{a treaty}} was made between Russia and Norway fixing the {{boundary}} between the Svalbard archipelago and the Novaya Zemlya archipelago. Increased interest in petroleum exploration in the Arctic raised interest in a resolution of the dispute.

5|$|The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) was {{introduced}} in 1995 in the Human Development Report written by the United Nations Development Program in order to add a gender-sensitive dimension to the Human Development Index. The GDI <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> not only the average or general level of well-being and wealth within a given country, but also how this wealth and well-being is distributed between different groups within society, especially between genders. However, feminist economists do not universally agree {{on the use of}} the GDI and some offer improvements to it.|$|E
5|$|The {{brains of}} humans and other {{primates}} contain the same structures as the brains of other mammals, but are generally larger in proportion to body size. The encephalization quotient (EQ) is used to compare brain sizes across species. It <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> the nonlinearity of the brain-to-body relationship. Humans have an average EQ in the 7-to-8 range, while most other primates have an EQ in the 2-to-3 range. Dolphins have values {{higher than those of}} primates other than humans, but nearly all other mammals have EQ values that are substantially lower.|$|E

5|$|The {{examination}} of skeletal remains often <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> environmental {{factors that affect}} decomposition. Forensic taphonomy {{is the study of}} these postmortem changes to human remains caused by soil, water, and the interaction with plants, insects, and other animals. In order to study these effects, body farms have been set up by multiple universities. Students and faculty study various environmental effects on the decomposition of donated cadavers. At these locations, cadavers are placed in various situations and their rate of decomposition along with any other factors related to the decomposition process are studied. Potential research projects can include whether black plastic causes decomposition to occur faster than clear plastic or the effects freezing can have on a dumped body.|$|E
5|$|The {{expected}} {{number of}} generations for fixation to occur {{is proportional to}} the population size, such that fixation is predicted to occur much more rapidly in smaller populations. Normally the effective population size, which is smaller than the total population, is used to determine these probabilities. The effective population (N'e) <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> factors such as the level of inbreeding, the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest, and the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E
5|$|The {{time for}} a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on {{population}} size, with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations. The number of individuals in a population is not critical, but instead a measure known as the effective population size. The effective population is usually smaller than the total population since it <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>account</b> {{factors such as the}} level of inbreeding and the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E
