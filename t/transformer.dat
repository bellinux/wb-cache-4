5|$|Now activated, Omega Supreme pursues Megatron and his minions relentlessly. Megatron, Soundwave and Breakdown {{devise a}} plan to lure Omega Supreme to a rooftop defended with turrets, where the giant <b>Transformer</b> is ambushed. Omega Supreme sustains heavy damage and plummets to Cybertron's lower levels. The Decepticons follow Omega Supreme and engage him in a lengthy final battle, in which Omega Supreme is finally defeated, {{infected}} with Dark Energon, and captured by the Decepticons. Megatron forces Omega Supreme {{to open the door}} to Cybertron's core and travels there with his minions. Upon arrival he infects the core of Cybertron, also a <b>Transformer,</b> with Dark Energon, which then begins to spread over the entire planet.|$|E

5|$|The system {{inverters}} typically provide {{power output}} at voltages {{of the order}} of 480 VAC. Electricity grids operate at much higher voltages {{of the order of}} tens or hundreds of thousands of volts, so transformers are incorporated to deliver the required output to the grid. Due to the long lead time, the Long Island Solar Farm chose to keep a spare <b>transformer</b> onsite, as <b>transformer</b> failure would have kept the solar farm offline for a long period. Transformers typically have a life of 25 to 75 years, and normally do not require replacement during the life of a photovoltaic power station.|$|E
5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down <b>transformer</b> and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding <b>transformer</b> is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the <b>transformer</b> is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E

50|$|LTCC <b>transformers</b> {{are similar}} to LTCC {{inductors}} except <b>transformers</b> contain two or more windings. To improve coupling between windings <b>transformers</b> include a low-permeability dielectric material printed over the windings on each layer. The monolithic nature of LTCC <b>transformers</b> leads to a lower height than traditional wire wound <b>transformers.</b> Also, the integrated core and windings means these <b>transformers</b> are not prone to wire break failures in high mechanical stress environments.|$|R

5|$|In July 1888, Brown and Peck {{negotiated}} a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase induction motor and <b>transformer</b> designs for $60,000 {{in cash and}} stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor.

5|$|In a wind farm, {{individual}} turbines are interconnected with {{a medium}} voltage (often 34.5 kV), {{power collection system}} and communications network.

5|$|After its retirement, 4859 was {{purchased}} in for $13,000 by the Harrisburg {{chapter of the}} National Railroad Historical Society and donated to the Harrisburg Redevelopment Authority.

The main <b>transformer</b> was removed and drained of the hazardous polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) used as coolant.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} {{was used by}} the LIMPET 500 (Land Installed Marine Power Energy <b>Transformer)</b> energy converter which was installed on the island of Islay by Wavegen Ltd. It was a shore-based unit and generated power when waves run up the beach, creating pressure inside an inclined oscillating water column. This in turn creates pneumatic power which drives the twin 250kW generators. Islay LIMPET was opened in 2001 and was the world's first commercial scale wave-energy device. In March 2013 Voith Hydro decided to close down Wavegen choosing to concentrate on tidal power projects.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where <b>transformer</b> type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E

5|$|Further inland, {{moisture}} from Bonnie {{combined with a}} cold front to produce widespread thunderstorms over Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee.
