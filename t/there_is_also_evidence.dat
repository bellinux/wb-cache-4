5|$|After the Real/Xe complex, {{came the}} Escoba period, dating to {{approximately}} 600CE-300CE. The ceramics {{between these two}} periods are similar, but Escoba ceramics are more extensive and stratigraphically separated. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> during {{this time of the}} population increase that would peak {{at the end of the}} Cantutse period.|$|E
5|$|The El Niño-Southern Oscillation {{affects the}} {{precipitation}} distribution, by altering rainfall patterns across the western United States, Midwest, the Southeast, {{and throughout the}} tropics. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> {{that global warming is}} leading to increased precipitation to the eastern portions of North America, while droughts are becoming more frequent in the tropics and subtropics.|$|E
5|$|The painful stings of {{bees are}} mostly {{associated}} with the poison gland and the Dufour's gland which are abdominal exocrine glands containing various chemicals. In Lasioglossum leucozonium, the Dufour's Gland mostly contains octadecanolide {{as well as some}} eicosanolide. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of n-triscosane, n-heptacosane, and 22-docosanolide. However, the secretions of these glands could also be used for nest construction.|$|E
5000|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of a {{very much}} earlier ringfort (with {{radiocarbon}} dates of 359-428 AD) in the townland [...] suggesting the area was inhabited from a very early date.|$|R
50|$|The Roman suburbs {{consisted}} of timber and cob buildings within small rectilinear plots, probably representing small holdings. However, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of much industry: smithing, pottery, lead, pewter and bronze working.|$|R
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> that {{specialist}} schools took fewer {{children from}} poorer families than non-specialist schools.One possible cause {{was that it}} may have be easier for middle-class parents to raise the necessary sponsorship.|$|R
5|$|There were {{occasional}} {{examples of}} men making unwanted homosexual advances, homosexuality being then criminal under both military and civil law, {{to escape the}} front lines, but prosecutions for this crime were rare, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of men {{turning a blind eye}} to homosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|A Roman bath {{house and}} Edwardian folly {{in the village}} of Whitestaunton were {{excavated}} by the archaeological television programme Time Team. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of iron workings in the Romano-British period, at Dunkeswell, which radiocarbon dating has placed in the 2nd century. It has been suggested that these and other iron-based technologies gave the hills a fairly industrial landscape during the Romano-British period, providing a source of the name Blackdown Hills. Local iron ores were smelted at Hemyock in small bloomeries (furnaces) to produce pure iron until the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur remains {{have been}} found since the early 19th century, {{although}} the very first remains that were described were mistaken for fish scales. Aetosaurs were later recognized as crocodile relatives, with early paleontologists considering them to be semiaquatic scavengers. They are now considered to have been entirely terrestrial animals. Some forms have characteristics {{that may have been}} adaptations to digging for food. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> that some if not all aetosaurs made nests.|$|E
50|$|Analyzing the {{habitation}} site, it {{was understood}} that people lived in a fortified town {{and it had a}} separate potters quarters. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of industrial activity and archaeologists think that it was a crowded busy town.|$|R
30|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of {{the process}} of {{connecting}} ideas. For example, Source Text 1 states that ‘the destruction of a language is the destruction of a rooted identity’. Ben illustrated this point by adding his own interpretation (see Excerpt 5).|$|R
50|$|When FGF19 was {{inhibited}} {{by specific}} anti-FGF19 antibodies in monkeys, severe diarrhea <b>was</b> the result. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of liver toxicity. Increases in bile acid synthesis, serum and fecal total bile acids, and specific bile acid transporters were found.|$|R
5|$|Some coins from Offa's reign {{bear the}} names of the archbishops of Canterbury, Jaenberht and, after 792, Æthelheard. Jaenberht's coins all belong to the light coinage, rather than the later medium coinage. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> that coins were issued by Eadberht, who was Bishop of London in the 780s and {{possibly}} before. Offa's dispute with Jaenberht may have led him to allow Eadberht coining rights, which may then have been revoked when the see of Lichfield was elevated to an archbishopric.|$|E
5|$|The Iron Age {{began in}} Scotland from about {{the seventh century}} BCE. From this point there are the first finds of iron {{artifacts}} in hoards that are consistent containing other items {{that are consistent with}} Bronze Age practice. <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of smithing and smelting on some settlement sites. Iron Age society in Scotland shared many traits with Southern Britain, Ireland and in some cases continental Europe. These included roundhouses and enclosed and fortified settlements, but it also contained elements of independent development.|$|E
5|$|The Peak District {{has been}} {{inhabited}} {{from the earliest}} periods of human activity, as is evidenced by occasional finds of Mesolithic flint artefacts and by palaeoenvironmental evidence from caves in Dovedale and elsewhere. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of Neolithic activity, including some monumental earthworks or barrows (burial mounds) such as that at Margery Hill. In the Bronze Age the area was well populated and farmed, and evidence of these people survives in henges such as Arbor Low near Youlgreave, or the Nine Ladies Stone Circle at Stanton Moor.|$|E
50|$|The hillfort was {{excavated}} {{over four}} years between 2010 and 2013 by Murray Cook and David Connolly of Rampart Scotland http://www.rampartscotland.co.uk/, and dates to {{the second half of}} the 1st millennium BC, though <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of limited Neolithic and Early Bronze Age activity.|$|R
50|$|A late prehistoric barrow ditch {{was located}} in the highest part of the Anglo-Saxon cemetery, on a false crest of the hill. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> for Romano-British {{activity}} on the site, with a small circular pit 2 feet deep cut into the chalk, containing a few sherds of Roman-era pottery.|$|R
5000|$|The cast {{was taken}} on September 22, 2000, during a Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) {{expedition}} to the Skookum Meadows area of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington state, during filming of the now-cancelled Animal-X television show. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of 17-inch human-like footprints found in the area.|$|R
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} engages in {{low levels of}} brood parasitism, {{and there are a}} few {{instances}} of cattle egret eggs being laid in the nests of snowy egrets and little blue herons, although these eggs seldom hatch. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of low levels of intraspecific brood parasitism, with females laying eggs in the nests of other cattle egrets. As much as 30% extra-pair copulations have been noted.|$|E
5|$|The priory {{was seized}} in 1414 by King Henry V of England {{along with a}} number of alien priories. In the first three centuries, there were several Priors appointed, {{sometimes}} with short tenures, but in 1500 Ralph Leonard was installed as Prior for life. However, within decades the Priory was abandoned, with evidence of Thomas de Baugy being the final Prior around 1560. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> that the priory was allocated to John After in 1566, who had also been appointed as the Dean of Guernsey.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, West Antarctica {{closely resembles}} the Andes {{mountain}} range of South America. The Antarctic Peninsula {{was formed by}} uplift and metamorphism of sea bed sediments during the late Paleozoic and the early Mesozoic eras. This sediment uplift was accompanied by igneous intrusions and volcanism. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are andesite and rhyolite volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in Marie Byrd Land and Alexander Island. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the Ellsworth Mountains region, where the stratigraphy is more similar to East Antarctica.|$|E
25|$|On 1 June 2007 a Europa Classic, {{registration}} G-HOFC, {{broke up}} during a flight over South Wales, United Kingdom, killing both occupants. The investigation indicated irregularities {{in the construction}} of the right wing attachment at the rear lift/drag pin. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of movement of the tailplane surfaces beyond the normal range of movement.|$|R
30|$|These {{lineages}} {{may have}} developed in geographical isolation during the Pleistocene and have remained largely allopatric without gene flow (Nm[*]=[*] 0.0) since that time. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> {{that both of}} these genetic lineages have undergone recent population expansions. We interpret these results {{in light of the}} recent evolution of Africa's modern drainage network.|$|R

5|$|Housing in Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} built habitation {{in what is now}} Scotland, from the earliest period of human occupation to the present day. The oldest house in Scotland dates from the Mesolithic era. In the Neolithic era settled farming led to the construction of the first stone houses. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> from this period of large timber halls. In the Bronze Age there were cellular round houses, crannogs (built on artificial islands) and hillforts that enclosed large settlements. In the Iron Age cellular houses begin to be replaced on the northern isles by simple Atlantic roundhouses, substantial circular buildings with a drystone construction. The largest constructions that date from this era are the circular brochs and duns and wheelhouses.|$|E
5|$|Human {{occupation}} {{dates back}} to the Beaker culture of the late Bronze Age. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of an Iron Age hill fort and prehistoric barrows and field systems. There is evidence of a shrine dating from pre-Roman times, which was re-established as a Romano-Celtic Temple in the mid-4th century. According to at least one source, it is extremely likely this was succeeded by a small late-4th-century Christian oratory. Several Roman finds including gold coins of Augustus, Nero, and Drusus, two silver denarii of Vespasian and a Roman carnelian ring were found at the site during quarrying.|$|E
5|$|Mental health {{consists}} of a broad scope of measurements of mental well being including depression, stress and measurements of self-worth. Numerous factors affect the prevalence of mental health disorders among women in India, including older age, low educational attainment, fewer children in the home, lack of paid employment and excessive spousal alcohol use. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> to suggest that disadvantages associated with gender increase the risk for mental health disorders. Women who find it acceptable for men to use violence against female partners may view themselves as less valuable than men. In turn, this may lead women to seek out fewer avenues of healthcare inhibiting their {{ability to cope with}} various mental disorders.|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} for the defendants {{was that she had}} appeared lucid to a bank clerk when withdrawing money a few days before her death. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> from the curate that she appeared to be lucid when making her will. Other witnesses attested to her lucidity around the time the will was made.|$|R

30|$|PROMIS-Fatigue SFs can {{quantify}} fatigue {{across the}} full continuum of RA disease activity. Scores increased significantly across CDAI levels by ≥ 0.5 SD (5 [*]units), an amount that is {{widely recognized as}} clinically meaningful [20]. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of dose-response relationships in SF scores as patients described the intensity of their fatigue worsening from ‘none’ to ‘severe’.|$|R
5|$|One {{argument}} {{in favour of}} the toxin acting as a defence against predators is the apparent Müllerian mimicry {{in some of the}} various unrelated pitohui species, which all have similar plumage. The species known as pitohuis were long thought congeneric, due to their similarities in plumage, but are now spread through three families, the oriole, whistlers and Australo-Papuan bellbirds. The similarity in appearance therefore presumably evolved as a shared aposematic signal to common predators of their distasteful nature. This signal is reinforced by the species' strong sour odor. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> that some other birds in New Guinea have evolved Batesian mimicry, where a non-toxic species adopts the appearance of a toxic species. An example of this is the non-toxic juvenile greater melampitta, which has plumage similar to the hooded pitohui.|$|E
5|$|The {{allometric}} exponent for sail {{height is}} similar in magnitude to the scaling of interspecific antler length to shoulder height in cervids. Furthermore, as Bakker (1970) observed {{in the context of}} Dimetrodon, many lizard species raise a dorsal ridge of skin during threat and courtship displays, and positively allometric, sexually dimorphic frills and dewlaps are present in extant lizards (Echelle et al. 1978; Christian et al. 1995). <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of sexual dimorphism both in the robustness of the skeleton and in the relative height of the spines of D. limbatus (Romer and Price 1940).|$|E
5|$|The first clear {{reference}} {{to the use of}} the Highland bagpipes is from a French history, which mentions their use at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. George Buchanan claimed that they had replaced the trumpet on the battlefield. This period saw the creation of the ceòl mór (the great music) of the bagpipe, which reflected its martial origins, with battle-tunes, marches, gatherings, salutes and laments. The Highlands in the early seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the MacCrimmonds, MacArthurs, MacGregors and the Mackays of Gairloch. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of adoption of the fiddle in the Highlands with Martin Martin noting in his A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland (1703) that he knew of eighteen players in Lewis alone.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Sixty-eight {{isolates}} of Aerornonas spp. {{were examined}} biochemically and their cell proteins were analysed by silver-stained SDS-PAGE. Protein fingerprints did not correlate with phenotype. However, consideration of both phenotype and fingerprint showed clustering of epidemiologically related isolates. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> that similar strains {{could be found}} in infected people and water or other environmental samples...|$|R
5000|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>evidence</b> of a {{very much}} earlier ringfort (with {{radiocarbon}} dates of 359-428 AD) in the townland of Castle Balfour Demesne [...] suggesting the area was inhabited from a very early date.
