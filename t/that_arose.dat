5|$|At the time, {{very few}} {{managers}} of pop groups {{knew about the}} income music merchandising could generate, as very few artists survived long enough in the pop domain {{to be a viable}} investment. As far as Epstein was concerned it was merely good public relations, and any revenue <b>that</b> <b>arose</b> from the sale of Beatles-endorsed products was regarded as merely extra money that supplemented the Beatles' individual incomes from live performances and record sales. Epstein had not recognised an industry which had grossed $20 million for Elvis Presley in 1957 alone.|$|E
5|$|Decades, and in {{some cases}} centuries, of British rule and {{emigration}} have left their mark on the independent nations <b>that</b> <b>arose</b> from the British Empire.

5|$|Developmental biology can {{identify}} homologous structures <b>that</b> <b>arose</b> {{from the same}} tissue in embryogenesis. For example, adult snakes have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for hind legs, which are soon lost as the embryos develop. The implication that the ancestors of snakes had hind legs is confirmed by fossil evidence: the Cretaceous snake Pachyrhachis problematicus had hind legs complete with hip bones (ilium, pubis, ischium), thigh bone (femur), leg bones (tibia, fibula) and foot bones (calcaneum, astragalus) as in tetrapods with legs today.|$|E

Einstein preferred the determinism of classical physics over the probabilistic new quantum physics to which he himself had contributed.

5|$|The Secret Lives of Waldo Kitty was {{produced}} by Lou Scheimer and Norm Prescott and directed by Don Christensen and Rudy Larriva.

The series has a total of just 13 episodes. In 1989, three episodes from The Secret Lives of Waldo Kitty were featured on a VHS tape released by United American Video.|$|E

She served on Labour's National Executive Committee between 1947 and 1969. Her combative style led to a brief suspension from parliament in 1952.

5|$|Based on the study, Governor William O'Neill ordered ConnDOT in October 1986 to {{initiate}} rail {{service on the}} corridor. It was established as a temporary service to newly reopened local stations between Union Station in New Haven and Old Saybrook, to alleviate traffic congestion <b>that</b> <b>arose</b> from scheduled construction work on I-95. O'Neill introduced a $50 million transportation program that included $900,000 (later reduced to $500,000) for basic stations and $4 million to refurbish 12 Budd Rail Diesel Cars for rolling stock. The RDCs {{were found to be}} insufficient and two diesel trainsets were purchased from the defunct PATrain service in 1989 instead. Testing of the equipment on the Northeast Corridor began on December 2, 1989.|$|E

Immediately after Hastings, only those English noblemen who fought in the battle lost their lands, which were distributed to Normans and others from the continent who had supported William's invasion. The rebellions of the years 1068 to 1071 led to fresh confiscations of English land, again distributed to William's continental followers. By 1086, when William ordered the compilation of Domesday Book to record landholders in England, most of the native English nobility had been replaced by Norman and other continental nobles.|$|E

There were three trains during the ride's first year at Geauga Lake, however only two have been used since. The third train became a parts donor for the first two. Originally, riders reclined on the lift hill – rather than in the station – and returned to an upright position prior to re-entering the station. However, this was changed to occur in the station due to problems <b>that</b> <b>arose</b> during the ride's first season. The trains feature the Firehawk logo on the front colored yellow and red.
