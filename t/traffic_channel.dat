50|$|The CDMA radio {{configuration}} {{is defined}} as a combination of forward and reverse <b>traffic</b> <b>channel</b> transmission formats that are characterized by physical layer parameters such as data rates, error-correction codes, modulation characteristics, and spreading factors.

The question is whether two operators would have that many <b>traffic</b> <b>channels</b> between them, dependent on just one bearer for signalling and subject to occasional failure. It was of course practice to have standby route over a diverse path in case of outage on the original DP data circuit link.|$|R

Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) with eight users per carrier is used at a multi-user rate of 27 1 kbit/s, demanding a channel equaliser to combat dispersion. The error protected chip-rate of the full-rate <b>traffic</b> <b>channels</b> is 22. 8 kbitls, while in half-rate channels is 11. 4 kbitls. There are two speech <b>traffic</b> <b>channels,</b> five different-rate data <b>traffic</b> <b>channels</b> and 14 various control and signalling channels to support the system's operation. A moderately complex, 13 kbitls Regular Pulse Excited speech codec with long term predictor (LTP) is used, combined with an embedded three-class error correction codec and multi-layer interleaving to provide sensitivity-matched unequal error protection for the speech bits. An overall speech delay of 57. 5 ms is maintained. Slow frequency hopping at 217 hopsls yields substantial performance gains for slowly moving pedestrians. 1...|$|R

The FACCH is used for in-call signaling, including call disconnect, handover and the later stages of call setup. It has a payload data rate of 9.2 kbit/s when paired with a full-rate channel (FACCH/F) and 4.6 kbit/s when paired with a half-rate channel (FACCH/H). The FACCH uses the same interleaving and multiframe structure as its host TCH.|$|E
40|$|In CDMA systems {{combining}} {{of several}} <b>traffic</b> <b>channels</b> {{leads to a}} multi-code (MC) CDMA system offering higher user data rates without increasing the system bandwidth. Due to imperfect spreading sequences, the transmission quality degrades in case of multipath propagation. The additional noise power caused by co-channel interference increases linearily {{with the number of}} <b>traffic</b> <b>channels.</b> In this paper, we demonstrate how to reduce this noise by cancelling out the co-channel interference in an iterative way using soft values of the decoded bits. The gain depends on the operating point of the coded system. Simulation results for turbo codes and convolutional codes are close to the results for an AWGN channel.

5000|$|Some MPT 1327 {{networks}} {{can also}} time-share control channels, {{which can be}} useful if the network has limited frequency availability, as it frees up channels for use as <b>traffic</b> <b>channels,</b> which can also be pooled across sites so the network capacity follows the traffic. This is another advantage of MPT 1327 (and dPMR) over TDMA-based systems such as TETRA and DMR, which cannot pool <b>traffic</b> <b>channels</b> so efficiently (if at all). The disadvantage of using a time-shared CCH is that it slows down registration and calls and requires some customization of the registration process, so is only useful if the network has a patient user community! ...|$|R

50|$|Once a call {{comes in}} the mobile {{switches}} to a different pair of frequencies; a voice radio channel which the system carrier has made analog or digital. This pair carries the call. If an IS-54 signal is detected it gets assigned a digital <b>traffic</b> <b>channel</b> if one is available. The fast associated channel or FACCH performs handoffs during the call, with {{no need for the}} mobile {{to go back to the}} control channel. In case of high noise FACCH, embedded within the digital <b>traffic</b> <b>channel</b> overrides the voice payload, degrading speech quality to convey control information. The purpose is to maintain connectivity. The slow associated control channel or SACCH does not perform handoffs but conveys things like signal strength information to the base station.|$|E
