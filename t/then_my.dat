25|$|Hoxton's public gardens were {{a popular}} resort from the overcrowded City streets, {{and it is}} reputed that the name of Pimlico came from the publican, Ben Pimlico, and his {{particular}} brew.

The modern area of Pimlico derives its name from its former use in Hoxton.|$|E

25|$|I {{was playing}} good golf, {{but it really}} wasn't {{that big a deal}} to me one way or the other. And <b>then</b> <b>my</b> father died and I sort of {{realized}} that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.... It was a big boost.|$|E
25|$|Around 1954, {{parties were}} held at Florance's house, {{referred}} to as 'The Hovel'. According to Peter Oyston: over those years my sister and I worked out that we had 82 callers a week, not counting those who came more than once. It was constant open house. My stepfather would start a party with his muso friends while my mother was at the theatre. And <b>then</b> <b>my</b> mother would bring back the cast and any {{people who came to}} see the shows. And the taxi drivers and, if the police called to quieten us up, then the police would be invited in and they'd join the party too. It really was an extraordinary time.|$|E
25|$|I had {{carefully}} learned to understand, about that experience which I could have upon things of rule, how fortune is failing or great, subject to such rule in common, so that otherwise I {{would have had}} scant reason to desire such a rule, had I not found myself obliged to it through God’s bidding and nature. Now it was of my acquaintance, that inasmuch as God had let me be born a prince, such as I then am born, <b>then</b> <b>my</b> good and my destruction were knotted into one with the common good; for every reason then, it was now my promise that I should take great pains about their well-being and good governance and management, and thereabout bear close concern.|$|E

25|$|I grew up {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis {{and all that kind}} of stuff. And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types of things. And <b>then</b> <b>my</b> brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E
25|$|We {{are entirely}} in accord in admitting the {{existence}} of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now <b>then,</b> <b>my</b> faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.|$|E

500|$|In Coupang, Bligh {{reported}} the mutiny to the authorities, and {{wrote to his}} wife: [...] "Know <b>then,</b> <b>my</b> own Dear Betsey, I have lost the Bounty..." [...] Nelson the botanist quickly succumbed to the harsh Coupang climate and died. On 20 August, the party departed for Batavia (now Jakarta) to await a ship for Europe; the cook Thomas Hall died there, having been ill for weeks. Bligh obtained passages home for himself, his clerk Samuel, and his servant John Smith, and sailed on 16 October 1789. Four of the remainder—the master's mate Elphinstone, the quartermaster Peter Linkletter, the butcher Robert Lamb and the assistant surgeon Thomas Ledward—all died either in Batavia or on their journeys home.|$|E
500|$|On 9 October 1912, {{the driver}} of a horse-drawn {{carriage}} noticed a man crouching near {{the front door of}} the house of Countess Flora Sztaray, located on South Cliff Avenue in Eastbourne. Sztaray was known to possess large amounts of valuable jewellery and to be married to a rich Hungarian nobleman. The driver, who was Sztaray's coachman, informed Sztaray of the man's presence, whereupon Sztaray telephoned the police. Inspector Arthur Walls was sent to investigate. When Walls arrived on the scene, he observed a man lying on the portico above the front door. Walls called out, [...] "Now <b>then,</b> <b>my</b> man, you just come down." [...] The man fired two shots, the first of which struck and killed Walls.|$|E
500|$|Her Jewish {{upbringing}} {{was influenced}} by her devoutly Orthodox Jewish maternal grandmother. Barr's parents kept their Jewish heritage secret from their neighbors and were partially involved in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Barr has stated, [...] "Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning I was a Jew; Sunday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon, and Wednesday afternoon we were Mormons". [...] When Barr was three years old, she got Bell's palsy {{on the left side}} of her face. Barr said, [...] " [...] my mother called in a rabbi to pray for me, but nothing happened. <b>Then</b> <b>my</b> mother got a Mormon preacher, he prayed, and I was miraculously cured". Years later Barr learned that Bell's palsy was usually temporary and that the Mormon preacher came [...] "exactly at the right time". [...] At six years old, Barr discovered her first public stage by lecturing at LDS churches around Utah and even was elected president of a Mormon youth group.|$|E

500|$|Classic Coronation Street was a {{recreation}} of 1960s Coronation Street. It starred Wood as the show's gossiping Ena Sharples, with Julie Walters as Martha Longhurst and Lill Roughley as Minnie Caldwell, with Ena telling them the [...] "gossip" [...] she has {{heard about the}} show's plotlines {{for the next two}} decades. The sketch was written with a detailed knowledge of the soap opera's past: [...] "That stuck up Ida Barlow, who's no better than she should be... it'll not be too long before she falls under a bus! That Harry Hewitt'll likely get crushed under the axle of 'is own van, and as for Valerie Barlow – and if this isn't judgement for setting 'erself up in 'er own front parlour as a so-called 'air stylist <b>then</b> <b>my</b> name isn't Ena Sharples – from what I 'ear, it's two clogs to a threpenny bit that she'll electrocute 'erself with 'er own 'airdryer." [...] This sketch's accuracy earned Wood praise from Doris Speed, who had played Annie Walker in Coronation Street from 1960 to 1983.|$|E
500|$|Ono studied piano {{from the}} age of 4 to 12 or 13. She {{attended}} kabuki performances with her mother, who was trained in shamisen, koto, otsuzumi, kotsuzumi, nagauta, and could read Japanese musical scores. At 14 Yoko took up vocal training in lieder-singing. At Sarah Lawrence, she studied poetry with Alastair Reid, English literature with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the Viennese-trained André Singer. Of this time Ono has said that her heroes were the twelve-tone composers Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg. She said, [...] "I was just fascinated with what they could do. I wrote some twelve-tone songs, <b>then</b> <b>my</b> music went into [...] area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and..... he said, 'Well, look, {{there are people who are}} doing things like what you do and they're called avant-garde.'" [...] Singer introduced her to the work of Edgar Varèse, John Cage, and Henry Cowell. She left college and moved to New York in 1957, supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society.|$|E
500|$|The Bailey {{household}} {{was very}} religious; Rose {{and his family}} attended a Pentecostal church, where he was required to attend services three to eight times per week and even taught Sunday school. Rose later recalled an oppressive upbringing, stating, [...] "We'd have televisions one week, <b>then</b> <b>my</b> stepdad would throw them out because they were Satanic. I wasn't allowed to listen to music. Women were evil. Everything was evil." [...] He accused his stepfather of physically abusing him and his siblings and sexually abusing his sister. Rose found solace in music from an early age. He sang in the church choir {{from the age of}} five, and performed at services with his brother and sister under the name the Bailey Trio. At Jefferson High School, he participated in the school chorus and studied piano. A second baritone, Rose began developing [...] "different voices" [...] during chorus practice to confuse his teacher. He eventually formed a band with his friends, one of whom was Jeff Isbell, later known as Izzy Stradlin.|$|E
