25|$|The Love-matic Grampa is {{a parody}} of fantasy sitcoms such as Mister Ed, I Dream of Jeannie and Bewitched as well as having {{similarities}} <b>to</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> the Car. The segment demanded {{a different approach to}} directing than a usual The Simpsons episode. Director Neil Affleck had to emulate a three camera setup, as is normally used in sitcoms.|$|E
25|$|Jacinto works. Emilio Jacinto is {{considered}} the Brains of the Katipunan, later the Revolution. His poetical masterpiece, written in Laguna on October 8, 1897, was A la Patría (To My Fatherland), with an inspiring melody paralleled from Rizal's Mi último adiós He also wrote a touching ode entitled A mí Madre (<b>To</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother).</b> His masterpiece in prose, the Kartilla (Kartilya, Primer) became the Bible of the Katipunan.(see below) His other prose writing was Liwanag at Dilim (Light and Darkness), {{a series of articles}} on human rights, liberty, equality, labor, government, and love of country. His nom-de-plume was Dimas-Ilaw.|$|E
500|$|The Love-matic Grampa is {{a parody}} of fantasy sitcoms such as Mister Ed, I Dream of Jeannie and Bewitched as well as having {{similarities}} <b>to</b> <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> the Car. The Love-matic Grampa machine singing [...] "Daisy Bell" [...] in a distorted manner when its electrical circuits are failing is a reference to HAL from the 1968 film [...] Grampa also references All Quiet on the Western Front, when Moe says he [...] "wrote the book on love". Moe's date, Betty, looks somewhat like Tress MacNeille, the actress who voiced her.|$|E

500|$|Other critics found {{religious}} {{parallels between}} E.T. and Jesus. Andrew Nigels described E.T.'s story as [...] "crucifixion by military science" [...] and [...] "resurrection by love and faith". According to Spielberg biographer Joseph McBride, Universal Pictures appealed {{directly to the}} Christian market, with a poster reminiscent of Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam and a logo reading [...] "Peace". Spielberg answered {{that he did not}} intend the film to be a religious parable, joking, [...] "If I ever went <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and said, 'Mom, I've made this movie that's a Christian parable,' what do you think she'd say? She has a Kosher restaurant on Pico and Doheny in Los Angeles." ...|$|E

2500|$|Coupland {{describes}} his upbringing as producing a [...] "blank slate". [...] "My mother {{comes from a}} sour-faced family of preachers who from the 19th century to well into the 20th scoured the prairies thumping Bibles. Her parents tried {{to get away from}} that but unwittingly transmitted their values <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> My father's family weren't that different." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ahmadzai {{was born}} in the village of Azra, Logar Province, Afghanistan. He is from the Kuchi tribe, along with former {{teammates}} Mohammad Nabi and Dawlat Ahmadzai. [...] He is far from certain about his age. In an interview in Potchefstroom with Will Luke in April 2009, he said, [...] "Talking <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> she works out my age by seeing who the president was. Unofficially I'm nearly 25, give or take three years. Or four. I could be 21 or 28." [...] Luke's own opinion, going by [...] "Deep-set wrinkles and a calm demeanour", was twenty-eight. The general consensus from Cricinfo and CricketArchive is that he was born on 3 September 1984.|$|E
2500|$|Hung recalled, [...] "I {{remember}} that the police visited our house frequently when I was a child. My parents sometimes frightened the children {{by saying that the}} police will visit if we misbehaved." [...] But her father never dwelt on the past in front of the children: [...] "although my father had resentments toward the authorities, regrets within his heart, and guilt for the family and children, he never expressed those feelings. I only heard him complain once <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> 'Haven't the KMT hurt us enough?'" [...] Even with the family in a poor financial status after his release from prison, Hung's father was still hospitable to his friends and often invited them over for dinner and conversation.|$|E
2500|$|He {{constantly}} avoids {{talking to}} his mother (Clare Coulter) who keeps calling him at work. Telling people to tell her {{he is in a}} meeting or on vacation, he {{even went so far as}} to have an intern get the telephone number to the show changed. When asked why he refused to talk to her he replies, [...] "Talk to her? You're missing the point. The point is, this place is too cheap to get me an assistant. If I had an assistant, she could talk <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> But because this place is so goddamn cheap, my mother has no one to talk to." [...] Findlay does, however, have a close relationship with his BMW dealer, often calling him about small problems with his [...] "$40,000 German car." ...|$|E

2500|$|At sixteen, then {{living on}} her own, Streisand's youth and {{ambition}} worked in her favor, but she lacked a mature woman's physical features which were needed for serious female roles. She therefore took various menial jobs {{to have some}} income. At one period, she lacked a permanent address, and found herself sleeping {{at the home of}} friends or anywhere else she could set up the army cot she carried around to save on rent expense. When desperate, she would return to her mother's flat in Brooklyn for a home-cooked meal. However, her mother would be horrified by her daughter's [...] "gypsy-like lifestyle," [...] wrote biographer Karen Swenson, and again begged her to give up trying to get into show business; but Streisand took her mother's pleadings as even more reason to keep trying: [...] "My desires were strengthened by wanting to prove <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> that I could be a star." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{celebrate}} the 20th {{anniversary of the}} band's formation, a new compilation titled [...] was released on 12 June and features a previously unheard demo from 1994, entitled She. Darren Hayes said of the recording; [...] "It's a long time ago, but my recollection is I was writing about the relationship that I have, and continue to have, with the women in my life. From my Sister <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>Mother</b> and all the friends and the wonderful female relationships in my life. I know I'm indebted to these incredibly strong women who loved me and taught {{me what it was}} like to be strong and succeed in a world where you sometimes feel underestimated." [...] The album also includes a bonus DVD of Australian and international music video releases. It accompanies a major re-release of their two studio albums with bonus tracks and live performances, the first time their catalogue has received such treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to having}} {{traveled}} internationally as a child, she learned English, Spanish and Danish fluently, {{and had a}} working knowledge of Portuguese and German. During her formative years, she showed no interest in acting. Miller said of her childhood, [...] "My mother was a professional singer and I think she was eager {{for me to go}} into the entertainment field." [...] However, after she played a main role in her high school's production of George S. Kaufman's The American Way (1939), her taste for show business began to form. In one version of how she was discovered by Hollywood, in 1944 the 18-year-old Miller saw an opportunity when a Warner Brothers talent scout was to attend one of her school's performances. The scout never showed up, so she sent a letter and photograph to the studio, and garnered a screen test at Warner, where she changed her name to Kristine Miller. When Miller set out for Hollywood, she recalled, [...] "People said <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> 'Are you letting that girl go to that awful place?'" [...] But her mother replied, [...] "I know that girl, and she’ll be all right." [...] Although she failed the screen test, she was noticed by producer Hal Wallis, who was then feuding with the studio head, Jack L. Warner. Under acrimonious circumstances, Wallis left Warner Brothers for Paramount Pictures. Wallis brought with him Miller and another actress that also failed a screen test at Warner, the 21-year-old Lizabeth Scott.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{think you}} had better go on <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> in the chaise, Giles,' said he. 'I would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time before I see her. You can say I am coming.' ...|$|R
60|$|I was late, {{and unable}} to eat much dinner, {{somewhat}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> alarm. Love had taken away my appetite.... After dinner, when I was wandering aimlessly about the yard, Tom appeared {{on the other side}} of the fence.|$|R

6000|$|Niaz moved uneasily in his chair. [...] "No," [...] he answered, [...] "not to me, Olga. It's--it's an {{old family}} relic--an heirloom, in fact. It belonged <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> mother. She was--a Mademoiselle de Kérouac, I believe, from Morbihan, in Brittany." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{all black}} beasts, Eugenio," [...] I {{answered}} heavily, and so startled him by words and tone that he ventured upon no further speech, but led me straight <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> private dining-room, {{opened the door}} and calmly announced me.|$|R
