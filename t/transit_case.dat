5000|$|The device, in a <b>transit</b> <b>case</b> {{and with}} its {{associated}} target frame and targets, was sold mainly to the Royal Air Force to train recruits; whilst the army treated the system {{with a degree of}} unjustified, but perhaps typical, disdain. There were two main models of Swift training rifle made available over a period of about three war years. These were the A and B series, which were each loosely based on the Lee-Enfield No.3 rifle ( [...] P14 in [...]303" [...] calibre and P17 in 30.06" [...] calibre); there was also a later B Series Rifle more closely modelled on the British Lee-Enfield No.4 rifle. A similar training rifle was manufactured in Canada at the Long Branch factory. It is arguable whether the latter was a better training rifle, but it was a far cheaper production item at a time when funds were needed to produce the real weapons for which these training rifles were simply economical teaching aids.|$|E

5000|$|The L42A1 was a 7.62×51mm NATO {{conversion}} of the [...]303 British chambered Lee-Enfield No. 4 Mk1(T) and No. 4 Mk1*(T) WWII-era British sniper rifles, which had remained in service for some time after the L1A1 variant of the 7.62mm FN FAL replaced the No.4 Lee-Enfield as the standard service rifle in 1957. It differed from other post-war No4 based variants in that the trigger remained hinged on the trigger guard as on the No4 Mk1 and 1*, not hung from the receiver as in the later No4 Mk 2, Mk 1/2 and Mk 1/3 [...]303 British rifles, and other 7.62×51mm NATO conversions. The conversion programme was carried out at Royal Small Arms Factory Enfield from 1970 to 1971. About 1,080 rifles were converted. A new hammer-forged heavy 7.62×51mm NATO barrel was installed, with four-groove, right hand twist rifling instead of the five-groove left-hand Enfield-type rifling used in [...]303 British barrels. The heavier barrel was free-floating, which meant that the required accuracy standard could be achieved without the barrel bearing against the wooden fore-end, as had {{been the case with}} the No.4 MkI(T). Therefore the woodwork was modified by shortening the fore-end to 1/2" [...] in front of the middle band, and a new design upper handguard was fitted. The No. 32 3.5 power telescopic sight was refurbished and the bullet drop compensation on the elevation drum modified for the ballistic characteristics of the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge in 50 m increments out to 1000 m. The modified version was renamed the [...] "Telescope, Straight Sighting, L1A1". A new magazine suitable for the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge was attached; it is recognisable by its shape, which is more angular compared to the [...]303 British version. A hardened projection of the left magazine lip serves as an ejector, although the [...]303 ejector screw remained in place. The butt with its screwed-on cheekpiece was retained, however the scope number on the wrist of the stock, was obliterated with [...] "X"-outs, and new numbers applied. The markings {{on the left side of}} the receiver were obliterated and new markings reflecting the new rifle's designation and chambering were applied. The original markings are sometimes partially visible underneath. A new, larger <b>transit</b> <b>case</b> was made for the L42A1.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Transportation mode {{choice is}} often {{expressed}} in terms of models which assume rational choice; psychological case studies of mode adoption are comparatively rare. We present findings from a study of the psychology of adoption for sustainable transportation modes such as bicycles, car sharing, and mass <b>transit.</b> <b>Case</b> studies were conducted with current and former participants in PSU’s ‘Passport Plus ’ transit pass program, as well as a longitudinal cohort study of first-time winter bicycle commuters. Composite sequence analysis was used to construct a theory of the adoption process for these modes. Our findings suggest that mode evaluation is cognitively distinct from mode selection and has different information requirements. We conclude that public and private organizations could improve the adoption rate for these modes by tailoring their communication strategies to match the commuter’s stage of adoption. Let’s Be Rational Transportation mode choice models are generally based o...|$|E

40|$|Suburbia largely remains hostile {{territory}} for public transit in America and, indeed, {{much of the}} developed world. Transit’s market share of every type of trip is steadily eroding outside of central cities virtually the world over. With trip origins and destinations spread all over the map, traditional fixed-route, fixed-schedule, radially oriented transit services are finding {{it increasingly difficult to}} compete with the private automobile. Yet against this backdrop, some metropolitan areas both in the United States and abroad have responded to low-density development patterns by designing more flexible, market-responsive forms of mass transit. Many strategies aim to eliminate, or at least marginalize, what is the scourge of suburban transit services worldwide – the transfer. This study examines Adaptive Transit as a promising approach toward better serving suburban markets. Initially, Adaptive Transit is defined and classified. Case studies from both the United States and abroad are then used to examine experiences across ten different forms of Adaptive Transit. "Best case" examples are cited, where possible. In addition to describing the rationales and service features of different forms of Adaptive <b>Transit,</b> <b>case</b> reviews focus on evaluating performance impacts, particularly with reference to "control cases" for winch traditional suburban services, in otherwise comparable settings, remain m place. Moreover, attention is given to matters of implementation. In most cases, the "software" (i. e., public policies) that accompanied the "hardware" (i. e., technologies and service innovations) was every bit important in achieving success...|$|E

But under proximate cause, the property owners adjacent to the river could sue (Kinsman I), but not the owners of the boats or cargoes which could not move until the river was reopened (Kinsman II).|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} way of searching for non-transiting exoplanets with dusty tails. In the <b>transiting</b> <b>case,</b> the {{extinction}} by dust during the transit removes more light from the beam than is scattered into it. Thus, the forward scattering component of the light is best seen either just prior to ingress, or just after egress, but with reduced amplitude over the larger peak that is obscured by the transit. This picture suggests {{that it should be}} equally productive to search for positive-going peaks in the flux from non-transiting exoplanets with dusty tails. We discuss what amplitudes are expected for different orbital inclination angles. The signature of such objects should be distinct from normal transits, starspots, and most - but not all - types of stellar pulsations.
