5|$|Since 1916, the 18 {{counties}} where <b>the</b> <b>O</b> {{lands are}} located have received payments from the United States government as {{compensation for the}} loss of timber and tax revenue, beginning as a 50% share of timber revenue on those lands but changing over the years as timber production decreased.

With this funding seemingly guaranteed, the counties kept other taxes much lower than other counties in the state, increasing their dependence on the timber payments.

A number o f alternative measures <b>o</b> f <b>the</b> cost <b>o</b> f capital to Irish industry are presented. It is shown that <b>the</b> ratio <b>o</b> f labour to capital costs has risen steeply over the period 1953 - 69, no matter which definition <b>o</b> f <b>the</b> cost <b>o</b> f capital is accepted.

40|$|<b>The</b> subject <b>o</b> f {{this paper}} is the {{regulation}} governing exclusive transfer o f milk quotas without <b>the</b> transfer <b>o</b> f <b>the</b> holding as provided for in Polish law. <b>The</b> term “transfer <b>o</b> f milk quota” contained in <b>the</b> title <b>o</b> f <b>the</b> paper is used in its broad sense. It covers both <b>the</b> disposal <b>o</b> f <b>the</b> quota (definitive transfer) and <b>the</b> granting <b>o</b> f <b>the</b> right to use the quota (temporary transfer). <b>The</b> system <b>o</b> f <b>the</b> milk quota transfer chosen by Poland does not rely on the strict, inseparable link between the quota and the holding. Moreover, it works in only one direction. This means that the disposal of, or <b>the</b> granting <b>o</b> f a right to use holding entails <b>the</b> transfer <b>o</b> f quota as well, while in order to transfer the quota only, {{it is not necessary}} to dispose <b>o</b> f <b>the</b> holding or grant the right to use it. Thus, it is possible to transfer the milk quota definitively or temporarily without <b>the</b> transfer <b>o</b> f or granting the right to use the holding. However, transactions involving <b>the</b> disposal <b>o</b> f a holding or granting the right to use the holding, need to comply with the requirements imposed by the legislator. <b>The</b> purpose <b>o</b> f <b>the</b> paper is to resolve selected issues arising from the application of the provisions on <b>the</b> transfer <b>o</b> f quotas without <b>the</b> transfer <b>o</b> f <b>the</b> holding in practice.
