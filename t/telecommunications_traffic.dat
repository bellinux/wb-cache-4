40|$|SUMMARY By reserving {{transmission}} capacity {{on a series}} of links from one node to another, making a virtual path connection (VPC) between these nodes, several benefits are obtained. VPCs will simplify routing at transit nodes, connection admission control, and QoS management by <b>traffic</b> segregation. As <b>telecommunications</b> <b>traffics</b> experience variations in the number of calls per time unit due to office hours, inaccurate forecasting, quick changes in traffic loads, and changes in the types of traffic (as in introduction of new services), {{there is a need to}} cope for this by adaptive capacity reallocation between different VPCs. We have developed a type of local VPC capacity management policy that uses an allocation function to determine the needed capacity for the coming updating interval, based on the current number of active connections but independently of the offered traffic. We determine its optimal parameters, and the optimal updating interval for different overhead costs. Our policy is shown to be able to combine benefits from both VP and VC routing by fast capacity reallocations. The method of signaling is easy to implement and our evaluations indicate that the method is robust. This paper is based on our earlier work, described in [19]. The calculations are simplified and the methodology is changed. 1...|$|R

40|$|As <b>telecommunications</b> <b>traffics</b> {{experience}} {{variations in}} the intensity due to office hours, inaccurate forecasting, quick changes in traffic load, {{and changes in the}} types of traffic (as in introduction of new services), {{there is a need to}} cope for this by adaptive change of the capacity in the network. This can be done by reserving transmission capacity on a series of links from one node to another making a virtual path (VP) between these nodes. The control of the VPs can be centralised, distributed or local. The idea of local and distributed approaches is to increase the robustness and performance compared to a central approach, which is depending on a central computer for the virtual path network (VPN) management. The main focus in this paper is to simulate different strategies and compare them to each other. The measured parameters are blocked traffic, the amount of signalling, unused capacity and maximal VP blocking. The simulation is done in a non-hierarchical network with one type of traffic i. e. a VP-subnetwork using statistical multiplexing and having Poissonian traffic streams. The size of the network is moderate. The VPN management will handle slow to medium fast variations, typically on the order of minutes up to hours. The traffic variations are met by reshaping the VPN in order to match the current demands. 1...|$|R
