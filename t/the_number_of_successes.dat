25|$|In {{probability}} theory and statistics, the {{negative binomial distribution}} is a discrete probability distribution of <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>successes</b> in a sequence of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials before a specified (non-random) number of failures (denoted r) occurs. For example, if we define a 1 as failure, all non-1s as successes, and we throw a dice repeatedly until the third time 1 appears (r = three failures), then the probability distribution {{of the number of}} non-1s that had appeared will be a negative binomial.|$|E
25|$|For {{the special}} case where r is an integer, the {{negative}} binomial distribution {{is known as the}} Pascal distribution. It is the probability distribution of a certain number of failures and successes in a series of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials. For knbsp&+nbsp&r Bernoulli trials with success probability p, the negative binomial gives the probability of k successes and r failures, with a failure on the last trial. In other words, the {{negative binomial distribution}} is the probability distribution of <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>successes</b> before the rth failure in a Bernoulli process, with probability p of successes on each trial. A Bernoulli process is a discrete time process, and so the number of trials, failures, and successes are integers.|$|E

25|$|In {{a famous}} example of {{hypothesis}} testing, {{known as the}} Lady tasting tea, Dr. Muriel Bristol, a female colleague of Fisher claimed {{to be able to}} tell whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup. Fisher proposed to give her eight cups, four of each variety, in random order. One could then ask what the probability was for her getting the number she got correct, but just by chance. The null hypothesis was that the Lady had no such ability. The test statistic was a simple count of <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>successes</b> in selecting the 4 cups. The critical region was the single case of 4 successes of 4 possible based on a conventional probability criterion (<nbsp&5%; 1 of 70 ≈nbsp&1.4%). Fisher asserted that no alternative hypothesis was (ever) required. The lady correctly identified every cup, which would be considered a statistically significant result.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The problem <b>of</b> {{estimating}} <b>the</b> <b>number,</b> n, <b>of</b> trials, given {{a sequence}} <b>of</b> k independent <b>success</b> counts obtained by replicating the n-trial experiment is reconsidered in this paper. In contrast to existing methods {{it is assumed}} here that more information than usual is available: not only <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>successes</b> are given but also <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pairs <b>of</b> consecutive <b>successes.</b> This assumption is realistic {{in a class of}} problems of spatial statistics. There typically k = 1, in which case the classical estimators cannot be used. The quality of the new estimator is analysed and, for k> 1, compared with that of a classical n-estimator. The theoretical basis for this is <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> pairs in Bernoulli trials, which can be determined by an elementary Markov chain argument. 1.

2500|$|In {{probability}} theory and statistics, the binomial distribution with parameters n and p is the discrete probability distribution of <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>successes</b> {{in a sequence}} of n independent experiments, each asking a yes–no question, and {{each with its own}} boolean-valued outcome: a random variable containing single bit of information: /yes/true/one (with probability p) or failure/no/false/zero (with probability q = 1 − p).|$|E
2500|$|The {{binomial}} distribution is frequently used to model <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>successes</b> {{in a sample}} of size n drawn with replacement from a population of size N. If the sampling is carried out without replacement, the draws are not independent and so the resulting distribution is a hypergeometric distribution, not a binomial one. [...] However, for N much larger than n, the {{binomial distribution}} remains a good approximation, and is widely used.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{definition}} is where X {{is the total}} number of n trials needed to get r failures. [...] Since {{the total number of}} trials is equal to <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>successes</b> plus the number of failures, the formulation is the same. [...] The only difference in the distribution is the range is shifted by a factor ofnbsp&r. [...] As such, the Mean, the median, and the mode are also shifted by a factor ofnbsp&r.|$|E
30|$|We also {{conducted}} multiple assembly experiments {{to evaluate a}} <b>success</b> rate <b>of</b> the proposed method. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> was 19 out of 20 trials and the success ratio was 95  %. The failure in our experiments occurred in {{the first step of}} the proposed method. This means that the released ring fell from the shaft. Therefore, the effect of the proposed hollows is verified although the proposed method should be improved. To avoid the failure, the error recovery method should be developed in the future.|$|R

2500|$|Each {{of these}} {{definitions}} of the negative binomial distribution can be expressed in slightly different but equivalent ways.

60|$|The true test of Zionism {{may seem}} a topsy-turvy test. It will not succeed by <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>successes,</b> but rather {{by the number of}} failures, or what the world (and {{certainly}} not least the Jewish world) has generally called failures. It will be tested, not by whether Jews can climb {{to the top of the}} ladder, but by whether Jews can remain at the bottom; not by whether they have a hundred arts of becoming important, but by whether they have any skill in the art of remaining insignificant. It is often noted that the intelligent Israelite can rise to positions of power and trust outside Israel, like Witte in Russia or Rufus Isaacs in England. It is generally bad, I think, for their adopted country; but in any case it is no good for the particular problem of their own country. Palestine cannot have a population of Prime Ministers and Chief Justices; and if those they rule and judge are not Jews, then we have not established a commonwealth but only an oligarchy. It is said again that the ancient Jews turned their enemies into hewers of wood and drawers of water. The modern Jews have to turn themselves into hewers of wood and drawers of water. If they cannot do that, they cannot turn themselves into citizens, but only into a kind of alien bureaucrats, of all kinds the most perilous and the most imperilled. Hence a Jewish state will not be a success when the Jews in it are successful, or even when the Jews in it are statesmen. It will be a success when the Jews in it are scavengers, when the Jews in it are sweeps, when they are dockers and ditchers and porters and hodmen. When the Zionist can point proudly to a Jewish navvy who has not risen in the world, an under-gardener who is not now taking his ease as an upper-gardener, a yokel who is still a yokel, or even a village idiot at least sufficiently idiotic to remain in his village, then indeed the world will come to blow the trumpets and lift up the heads of the everlasting gates; for God will have turned the captivity of Zion.|$|E
