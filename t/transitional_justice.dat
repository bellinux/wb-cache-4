25|$|The fifth {{point on}} the general {{agreement}} for negotiations was victims, a vast and complex item which included important issues such as <b>transitional</b> <b>justice,</b> reparations, truth and victims' rights.|$|E
25|$|The six-month window {{given to}} reach an {{agreement}} already appeared difficult to meet in November, due to delays in closing the <b>transitional</b> <b>justice</b> issue which became paralyzed despite the September 23 announcements because of different interpretations on thorny details between the two sides.|$|E

This paper provides a background to the state persecution of alleged Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) members, sympathsiers and their families, legal instruments and practices used to legitimate persecution, civil society initiatives seeking justice for the victims, actions taken by successive governments {{since the fall of}} president Soeharto and critique of the truth commission legislation.

40|$|Th is volume {{critically}} {{considers the}} manner in which post-dictatorial and post-conflict states are addressing past human rights violations through judicial accountability. The book’s main objectives concern a fresh, contemporary, and critical analysis of <b>transitional</b> criminal <b>justice</b> as a concept and its related measures, beginning with the initiatives that have been put in place with the fall of the Communist regimes in Europe in 1989. By <b>transitional</b> criminal <b>justice</b> we understand mechanisms of judicial accountability carried out in post-dictatorial or post-conflict states in order to address past human rights abuses. In addition to trials, the concept also refers to cases where criminal law mediates other measures of accountability. Th e project argues for rethinking and revisiting filters that scholars use to interpret key issues of <b>transitional</b> criminal <b>justice,</b> such as: (1) the relationship between judicial accountability, democratisation and politics in transitional societies; (2) the role of successor trials in rewriting history; (3) the interaction between domestic and international actors and norms in shaping transitional justice; and (4) the paradox of time in enhancing accountability. In order to accomplish this, the volume considers cases of domestic accountability in the post- 1989 era, from diff erent geographical areas, such as Europe, Asia and Africa, in relation to key events from various periods of time. In this way the approach, which investigates space and time-lines in key examples, also takes into account a longitudinal study of <b>transitional</b> criminal <b>justice</b> itself...|$|R

It makes a historical revision of how people have tried to regulate war and how it has been tried to be justified. It additionally studies victims’ circumstances in the context of <b>transitional</b> and restorative <b>justice.</b> Besides, it analyzes some international laws that have contributed to humanizing conflicts, and explores models of <b>transitional</b> and restorative <b>justice</b> that turn around the victim assailant relationship, contributing to the acknowledgement of the victim’s rights in a country like Colombia, where not until recent times, either conflict or victims’ existence were recognize...|$|R
25|$|On December 15, {{the final}} {{agreement}} on the fifth item of the agenda (victims), which includes <b>transitional</b> <b>justice,</b> was finally announced by the negotiating parties in Cuba. It built on the truth commission, the September 23 {{agreement on the}} Special Jurisdiction for Peace, {{as well as the}} October announcements on the search unit for disappeared persons.|$|E
25|$|The September 23 {{agreement}} on <b>transitional</b> <b>justice</b> {{was considered the}} most important moment {{in the peace process}} to date, because it resolved one of the most complicated issues through a formula satisfactory to both the guerrilla and the government, combining restorative justice with alternative sentences for guerrillas and agents of the State who have committeed crimes against humanity with amnesty for those responsible of political crimes. With the agreement, the peace process was considered to be 'irreversible'.|$|E
25|$|The Special Jurisdiction for Peace (Jurisdicción Especial para la Paz, JEP) {{would be}} the <b>transitional</b> <b>justice</b> {{component}} of the Comprehensive System, complying with Colombia's duty to investigate, clarify, prosecute and punish serious human rights violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian law which occurred during the armed conflict. Its objectives would be to satisfy victims' right to justice, offer truth to the public, contribute to the reparation of victims, contribute to the fight against impunity, adopt decisions which give full legal security to direct and indirect participants in the conflict {{and contribute to the}} achievement of a stable and lasting peace.|$|E

25|$|The {{international}} support {{for the implementation of}} the agreement would be meant to strengthen guarantees for the implementation of the agreement and would bring experiences, resources, monitoring and best practices to contribute to the implementation of the agreement. Some of the international organizations sought include the European Union, the Food and Agriculture Organization, Via Campesina, Unasur, Switzerland, the Dutch Institute for Multi-party democracy, UNESCO, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the United States of America, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Red Cross, the International Center for <b>Transitional</b> <b>Justice,</b> Sweden and UN Women.|$|E
25|$|SSR is {{considered}} an instrument of international development aid; and attaining good SSG is seen by practitioners as a conflict prevention tool and as a post-conflict stabilizer. Examples of mechanisms that international actors reportedly use to perform security sector reform include disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programmes to try and synchronize reforms to the security sector—and rule of law reforms as justice and security sectors are often considered intertwined. Likewise, SSR can be performed along <b>transitional</b> <b>justice</b> processes if the security sector has a legacy of violence against the population—and during security policy discussions to use SSR in supporting the implementation and reviews of the states' national security policy and strategy.|$|E

40|$|After {{transitions}} from repressive regimes to democracy, incoming democratic governments face a fundamental dilemma: should former authoritarian regimes be prosecuted or pardoned? Often, authoritarian regimes maintain significant {{influence over the}} terms of democratic transitions and post-transition democracies. Attempts to hold former authoritarian leaders accountable for abuses of power become problematic if trials provoke military intervention into politics, jeopardize post transition stability, or if the new democracy {{does not have the}} institutional capacity to uphold convictions. However, if post-transition democracies are able to hold past leaders accountable, then prosecutions serve to restore respect for the rule of law, making it clear that in newly established democracies certain actions are not only unacceptable, but also subject to punishment. This thesis concerns itself with one of <b>transitional</b> <b>justice’s</b> most fundamental mechanisms: prosecutions. Much {{has been written about the}} benefits, drawbacks, limitations, democratic consolidating effects, and structural factors related to post-transition trials. However, an empirical comparative analysis serves to confirm or disprove previous conclusions and might offer new insight into the questions of why certain democratic regimes are able to pursue trials after democratic transitions and what the actual effects of trials are on post-transition democracies. This comparative study of post-transition trials in Argentina and Chile finds that certain political factors enable or constrain post-transition trials, that post-transitional trials do not seem to change politics, but reflect entrenched political traditions, and that trials do not appear to significantly affect democratic consolidation or strengthen the rule of law...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{traces the}} {{concepts}} of such crimes under international law as genocide and crimes against humanity, of individual and collective responsibility for these crimes, and identifies the place of crimes of former communist regimes in Central and Eastern Europe among them. The thesis examines the sources of a duty to investigate and to punish human rights violations of a prior regime in international treaty and customary law which is not affected by a succession of States. An analysis of different methods by which post-communist democracies of Central and Eastern Europe {{come to terms with}} their past gives evidence of lustration (screening); condemning a previous regime and banning its ruling party as a criminal organization, and criminal proceedings against Communist Party officials. With specific reference to the example of Ukraine, where there exist valid grounds for accountability of the previous communist regime, it is argued that during the <b>transitional</b> period, <b>justice</b> could be achieved by way of outlawing the Communist Party of Ukraine. The accountability of the previous communist regime would be much facilitated by involving international law standards and international investigating bodies...|$|R
25|$|The {{agreement}} on <b>transitional</b> <b>justice</b> {{was the result}} of lengthy discussions between government and guerrilla lawyers in Havana and Bogotá, which had begun in July working under Santos' ultimatum to reach such an agreement by November at the latest. Facing an impasse in Havana, the negotiators delegated the file to a group of six respected jurists - Spanish lawyer Enrique Santiago, Conservative politician Álvaro Leyva, human rights advocate Diego Martínez, former judge Manuel José Cepeda, University of Notre Dame professor Douglass Cassel and rector of the Universidad Externado de Colombia Juan Carlos Henao; the first three selected by the FARC, the latter three by the government. By September, the team of six had a text ready to be announced in Havana.|$|E
25|$|In response, Rwanda {{implemented}} the Gacaca court system, which necessarily evolved {{to fit the}} scenario from its prior form of traditional cultural communal law enforcement procedures. The Gacaca courts are a method of <b>transitional</b> <b>justice</b> and are designed to promote communal healing and rebuilding {{in the wake of}} the Rwandan Genocide. Rwanda has especially focused on community rebuilding placing justice in the hands of trusted citizens. However, the system has come under criticism from a number of sources, including the Survivors Fund, which represents survivors of the genocide, due to the danger that it poses to survivors and there have been a number of reports on survivors being targeted for giving evidence at the courts. However, the Rwandan government maintains the success of Gacaca Courts citing their present success as a country.|$|E
25|$|The {{item was}} one of the most {{complicated}} for the two parties to find an agreement on. The FARC, which claimed that it's insurgency was justified and that they it was not militarily defeated, initially refused to submit to the laws and institutions of a political system which it opposed. On the other hand, the government had the obligation to design a <b>transitional</b> <b>justice</b> system which would be satisfactory to the FARC (who sought restorative justice) but also in keeping with Colombia's international treaty obligations, notably the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Complicating issues further, both the FARC and the government have historically refused to admit responsibility for crimes they have committed, with the guerrilla considering itself a victim of State oppression and the Colombian government considering itself to be the leader and defender of a democratic society.|$|E
40|$|The Act 975 of 2005 which {{establishes}} {{a process of}} <b>transitional</b> and restorative <b>justice</b> has as objectives first, to facilitate peace processes and second, to reintegrate into society, collective or individually, illegal armed group members. However, this process should grant victims’ rights to truth, justice and reparation, and non-repetition of abuses. Hence, the process highlights the victim as its main character and it conditions the criminals nominated to {{the benefits of the}} Justice and peace process, as with the alternative sentencing, in order to ensure the right to integral reparation of damages suffered as consequence of the grave human rights violations to which the victims were subject of. This article seeks to outline the legal representative’s role for victims to finally accomplish this within the framework of Justice and peace proces...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. In {{international}} criminal law, {{the application of}} the principle of concurrent jurisdiction necessitates the existence of two types of Courts: a national court and an international one. As a result of the uniqueness of the Rwandan context, there were more courts hearing matters that arose from the genocide. 6 In Rwanda, such cases are tried by ‘conventional courts’ and the ‘Gacaca’ courts. Gacaca is defined as a system of <b>transitional</b> participative community <b>justice,</b> whereby the population is given the chance to speak about the committed atrocities, to prosecute, defend, judge and punish the criminals. The conventional courts are divided into ordinary courts and military courts. All these courts have the jurisdiction to prosecute genocide cases. Genocide cases were therefore heard in three different courts domestically but in concurrence with International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). As a result of the particular context of the Rwandan Genocide of 1994, particular issues arise and will be explored in this study...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} {{different}} frameworks for {{international criminal justice}} in which China’s influence can be measured, or should be present, looking specifically at procedural traditions on which international criminal law and its jurisprudence {{are said to be}} based. Understanding China as a <b>transitional</b> hybrid criminal <b>justice</b> model undergoing radical transformation in its justice delivery and discourse, it is argued, assists significantly in forecasting where the synthesis of international criminal procedure may be heading. Attached to a re-interpretation and critique of individualised liability is the unpacking of China’s in principle commitment to communitarian rights and social protection as a foundation for its criminal justice model. How might a similar normative direction influence the diversification and ‘rights’ perceptions of international criminal justice? In particular, in today’s China, which is experiencing a rapid and relentless reconfiguration of communitarian identity and obligation, will collective rights commitments survive to influence the development of domestic criminal justice? From a more formalist consideration of international criminal justice, the paper explores what ‘alternative’ global justice paradigms offer China, and vice versa. Speculation on the opportunities available to China in regional and international governance, through more constructive involvement with international criminal justice is proposed against a call for a wider consideration of rights paradigms in so far as they recognise community interests as well as individual integrity. The strain between these priorities reveals how Asian states could find it more difficult to administer domestic criminal justice in accordance with the rightful demands of international conventions...|$|R

Goldstone {{was president of the}} Jewish training and education charity World ORT between 1997 and 2004. He was an honorary member of the Board of Governors of Hebrew University for over ten years prior to June 2010, when the University announced he had been dropped from the Board due to inactivity [...] "for a decade or more". In April 2010, Jerusalem lawyer David Schonberg had requested Goldstone be removed from the Board because of the UN report on Gaza. A University spokesperson stated that removing inactive members was a routine procedure, that other inactive members had also been removed, and that Goldstone's removal had [...] "nothing to do with his Report about Gaza".|$|E
500|$|As {{in other}} crises, Chamorro's ability to {{compromise}} was pivotal. The {{executive and legislative}} branches became more interdependent, but power was shared. The National Assembly prepared the budget, but {{the president had to}} be consulted on taxation; Supreme Court vacancies had to be agreed on by both of the other branches of government; and although the president retained the power of veto, the legislature could overturn a veto by a simple majority vote. Though some of the changes also included reform of the Code of Criminal Procedures—creating trial by jury, expanding the right of citizens to press charges, and evaluating police authority, among others—failure of the government to investigate past abuses by the police and the military or institute judicial proceedings, granted tacit impunity for those who committed human rights abuses or violence. Though the 1990 Amnesty Law had curtailed some of administration's ability to prosecute, it also lacked the funds, impartial judiciary and possibly the will to seek <b>transitional</b> <b>justice.</b> [...] Sofía Montenegro, editor of the Sandinistan paper Barricada and others have argued that Chamorro would have dealt with past abuse if she could have, but others, like Bishop Bernardo Hombach, are confident that her faith would have required her to forgive. Prosecutions would have prolonged conflict and harsh retaliation would not have brought about the reconciliation and peace she desired.|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyThis study, which seeks {{to contribute to the}} shared-body of knowledge on media and war crimes jurisprudence, gauges the impact of the media’s coverage of the Civil Defence Forces (CDF) and Charles Taylor trials conducted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) on the functionality of civil society organizations (CSOs) in promoting <b>transitional</b> (post-conflict) <b>justice</b> and democratic legitimacy in Sierra Leone. The media’s impact is gauged by contextualizing the stimulus-response paradigm in the behavioral sciences. Thus, media contents are rationalized as stimuli and the perceptions of CSOs’ representatives on the media’s coverage of the trials are deemed to be their responses. The study adopts contents (framing) and discourse analyses and semi-structured interviews to analyse the publications of the selected media (For Di People, Standard Times and Awoko) in Sierra Leone. The responses to such contents are theoretically explained with the aid of the structured interpretative and post-modernistic response approaches to media contents. And, methodologically, CSOs’ representatives’ responses to the media’s contents are elicited by ethnographic surveys (group discussions) conducted across the country. The findings from the contents and discourse analyses, semi-structured interviews and ethnographic surveys are triangulated to establish how the media’s coverage of the two trials impacted CSOs’ representatives’ perceptions on post-conflict justice and democratic legitimacy in Sierra Leone. To test the validity and reliability of the findings from the ethnographic surveys, four hundred (400) questionnaires, one hundred (100) {{for each of the four}} regions (East, South, North and Western Area) of Sierra Leone, were administered to barristers, civil/public servants, civil society activists, media practitioners, students etc. The findings, which reflected the perceptions of people from large swathe of opinions in Sierra Leone, appeared to have dovetailed with those of the CSOs’ representatives across the country. The study established that the media’s coverage of the CDF trial appeared to have been tainted with ethno-regional prejudices, and seemed to be ‘a continuation of war by other means’. However, the focus groups perceived the media reporting as having a positive effect on the pursuit of post-conflict justice, good governance and democratic accountability in Sierra Leone. The coverage of the Charles Taylor trial appeared to have been devoid of ethno-regional prejudices, but, in the view of the CSOs, seemed to have been coloured by lenses of patriotism and nationalism...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{violence}} in sustaining the political projects of state ruling elites in Mozambique and, more broadly, sub-Saharan Africa, remains under researched. In Mozambique, many {{of the authors of}} the literature produced in the 1980 s avoided writing about the issue of Frelimo 2 ̆ 7 s use {{of violence}} and the numbers and identities of the victims. This article aims to fill this gap. It focuses on the continuities in Frelimo 2 ̆ 7 s anti-colonial and post-independence violent trajectories,and the party 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to depart from the practices of the preceding regime and eradicate alleged enemies from society. In the early period of independence, Frelimo depended on the politics of memory as well as on mobilisation of Mozambicans through and to violence, <b>transitional</b> and revolutionary <b>justice.</b> This culminated in 1982 with the realisation of a week-long, complex political event known as the 2 ̆ 7 Meeting of the Compromised 2 ̆ 7, under the leadership of the late Samora Machel. By examining Machel 2 ̆ 7 s behaviour at this meeting and the reactions of some of those who were compromised, this article reveals the political ambivalences of Frelimo 2 ̆ 7 s authority in postcolonial Mozambique, in that violence both enabled the Frelimo elite to rule officially but also seriously endangered their political project and brought great suffering to the people. These contradictions helped to show the fractures and increasing disarray of Frelimo 2 ̆ 7 s revolutionary project and fostered Machel 2 ̆ 7 s own political and moral collapse. © 2010 The Editorial Board...|$|R
40|$|The Complex Dispute Resolution series {{collects}} {{essays on}} the development of foundational dispute resolution theory and practice and its application to increasingly more complex settings of conflicts in the world, including multi-party and multi-issue decision making, negotiations in political policy formation and governance, and international conflict resolution. Each volume contains an original introduction by the editor, which explores the key issues in the field. All three volumes feature essays which span an interdisciplinary range of fields, law, political science, game theory, decision science, economics, social and cognitive psychology, sociology and anthropology and consider issues in the uses of informal and private processes, as well as more formal and public processes. The essays question whether the development of universal theoretical insights about conflict resolution is possible with variable numbers of parties and issues and in multi-cultural and multi-jural settings. Each volume also presents a coda, summarizing key issues in the field and suggesting further avenues for research. The third volume (and the introductory essay here) applies foundational dispute resolution theories and practices {{to a wide variety of}} transnational, international and transcultural dispute settings. The essays explore the uses of formal diplomacy, political negotiation processes, formal international adjudication in a variety of tribunals, public and private arbitration, mediation processes, and a new set of hybrid processes. The introductory essay and chapters here also describe and interrogate new forms of international conflict handling, if not “resolution,” in modern forms of <b>transitional</b> and restorative <b>justice,</b> truth and reconciliation commissions, as well as hybrid tribunals. Some of the essays critique the tensions between the need for formal prosecution, punishment and adjudication of grievous wrongs, as in genocides and human rights violations and the needs and desires of societies and individuals to “move on” or create ways of re-integrating or restoring peace, as well as justice, in post-conflict situations. The question of whether “alternative” forms of justice and process are consistent with efforts to create international “rule of law” regimes is also queried. The Coda and other essays also explore whether there are necessarily cultural variations in conflict resolution, restorative and retributive or punitive justice. As with volumes I and II in this series, some of the classic works in the field of international dispute resolution are presented, while the idea of whether there are “universal” theories and practices of dispute resolution, across cultures and contexts is examined by the series editor and a number of authors...|$|R
