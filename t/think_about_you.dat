25|$|In linguistics, wh-movement (also {{known as}} wh-fronting or wh-extraction or long-distance dependency) {{concerns}} special rules of syntax—rules observed in many languages around the world—involving {{the placement of}} interrogative words. The special interrogatives, whatever the language, are known within linguistics as wh-words (so named because most interrogative words in the English language start with a wh-; for example, who(m), whose, what, which, etc.). Wh-words are used to form questions, and can also occur in relative clauses. In languages exhibiting wh-movement, sentences or clauses containing a wh-word show a special word order that has the wh-word (or phrase containing the wh-word) appearing {{at the front of}} the sentence or clause, e.g. Who do you think about?, instead of in a more canonical position further to the right, e.g. I <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> The opposite is called wh in situ.|$|E
2500|$|... "Kim" [...] was {{the first}} song the rapper {{recorded}} for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote [...] "Kim" [...] {{at a time in}} which {{he and his wife were}} separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, [...] "I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> this much. To even put you on a song like this'. [...] " [...] The song [...] "Stan" [...] was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's [...] "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for [...] "Stan" [...] differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: [...] "'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about. [...] " [...] Dido later heard [...] "Stan" [...] and enjoyed it, and observed, [...] "I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it. ' When they sent [...] to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow! This track's amazing.

50|$|As a witch, Tiffany {{possesses}} First Sight, {{the ability}} to see 'what is really there' (as opposed to second sight, which shows people what they think ought to be there). She also possesses Second Thoughts, which are defined as 'the thoughts <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the way <b>you</b> think'. Whilst other witches are said to have this trait as well, Tiffany also recognizes some of her thoughts as Third Thoughts (the thoughts <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the way <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the way <b>you</b> <b>think),</b> and Fourth Thoughts (the thoughts <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the way <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the way <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the way <b>you</b> <b>think).</b> All these thoughts sometimes cause Tiffany to walk into door frames.|$|R
