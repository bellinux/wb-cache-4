5|$|Egg-laying (ovipositing) {{involves}} {{not only}} the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation <b>to</b> <b>deposit</b> eggs on a suitable substrate, but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem. The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own, something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up {{much of the time}} that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture. Flying in tandem has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges <b>to</b> <b>deposit</b> eggs, the male may help to pull her out of the water.|$|E

5|$|The foreign {{exchange}} rules also oblige Icelandic residents <b>to</b> <b>deposit</b> any new foreign currency they receive with an Icelandic bank. There is anecdotal evidence that some Icelandic exporters had been operating an informal offshore {{foreign exchange}} market, trading pounds and euros for krónur outside {{the control of}} any regulator and starving the onshore market of foreign currency.

5|$|The {{terrain of}} South Florida is {{relatively}} and consistently flat. The limestone that underlies the Everglades {{is integral to}} the diverse ecosystems within the park. Florida was once part of the African portion of the supercontinent Gondwana. After it separated, conditions allowed a shallow marine environment <b>to</b> <b>deposit</b> calcium carbonate in sand, shells, and coral to be converted into limestone. Tiny bits of shell, sand, and bryozoans compressed over multiple layers forming structures in the limestone called ooids, which created permeable conditions that hold water.|$|E
40|$|Session: 66 -Asset PricingTitle on paper: Financial Inclusion for Stability: Access <b>to</b> Bank <b>Deposits</b> and the Deposit Growth {{during the}} Global Financial CrisisIn crisis times, depositors get anxious, can run on banks, and {{withdraw}} their deposits. Correlated deposit withdrawals of bank deposits {{could be mitigated}} if bank deposits are more diversified, i. e. held by more individuals. This paper examines the link between a broader access <b>to</b> bank <b>deposits</b> prior <b>to</b> the 2008 crisis and the dynamics of bank deposit growth in the crisis, while controlling for relevant covariates. Employing the proxies of Honohan (2008) for access <b>to</b> <b>deposits</b> and of Demirguc-Kunt and Klapper (2012) {{for the use of}} bank deposits, the authors find that greater access <b>to</b> bank <b>deposits</b> can make the deposit funding base of banks more resilient in times of financial stress. Policy efforts to enhance financial stability should thus focus not only on macroprudential regulation, but also recognize the positive effect of broader access <b>to</b> bank <b>deposits</b> on financial stability. postprin...|$|R

We next examine, using variance decompostions in the VAR systems, the relative contribution of the above ratios to changes in money multipliers, as well as the contribution of the multipliers and base money to money supply changes, and find some interesting implications for monetary policy-makers. Finally, the money multipliers are esimated also using the instrumental variable method. Collected Papers on the Occasion of the Retirement of Professor Kenji Komats...|$|R

5|$|Aligned ZnO {{nanowires}} on pre-seeded silicon, glass, and {{gallium nitride}} substrates have been grown using aqueous zinc salts such as zinc nitrate and zinc acetate in basic environments. Pre-seeding substrates with ZnO creates sites for homogeneous nucleation of ZnO crystal during the synthesis. Common pre-seeding methods include in-situ thermal decomposition of zinc acetate crystallites, spincoating of ZnO nanoparticles {{and the use}} of physical vapor deposition methods <b>to</b> <b>deposit</b> ZnO thin films. Pre-seeding can be performed in conjunction with top down patterning methods such as electron beam lithography and nanosphere lithography to designate nucleation sites prior to growth. Aligned ZnO nanowires can be used in dye-sensitized solar cells and field emission devices.|$|E

During the administration of his bankruptcy case, the U.S. Department of Labor complained that these funds were paid at least partially with unlawfully withdrawn monies that Vick held in trust for himself and eight other employees of MV7, a celebrity marketing company he owned.|$|E

If the multiplier is reduced from a shock {{and the amount of}} base money is constant, the money stock will decrease as a consequence. Thornton and Bagehot, therefore, suggested that the lender of last resort should increase the money base to offset the reduction of the multiplier. That was meant to keep the money stock constant and prevent an economic contraction.|$|R

5|$|Because {{the lighter}} group 12 {{elements}} often occur as chalcogenide ores, experiments {{were conducted in}} 2015 to attempt <b>to</b> <b>deposit</b> copernicium atoms on a selenium surface to form copernicium selenide, CnSe. Reaction of copernicium atoms with trigonal selenium to form a selenide were observed, with ΔHadsCn(t-Se) > 48kJ/mol, with the kinetic hindrance towards selenide formation being lower for copernicium than for mercury. This was unexpected as {{the stability of the}} group 12 selenides tends to decrease down the group from ZnSe to HgSe, while it increases down the group for the group 14 selenides from GeSe to PbSe.|$|E
5|$|In despair, Vitellius {{attempted}} {{to negotiate a}} surrender. Terms of peace, including a voluntary abdication, were agreed upon with Titus Flavius Sabinus II but the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard—the imperial bodyguard—considered such a resignation disgraceful and prevented Vitellius from carrying out the treaty. On the morning of 18 December, the emperor appeared <b>to</b> <b>deposit</b> the imperial insignia at the Temple of Concord {{but at the last}} minute retraced his steps to the Imperial palace. In the confusion, the leading men of the state gathered at Sabinus' house, proclaiming Vespasian as Emperor, but the multitude dispersed when Vitellian cohorts clashed with the armed escort of Sabinus, who was forced to retreat to the Capitoline Hill.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of dams on the Missouri, pallid sturgeon migrated hundreds of miles upstream to spawn, and sought out rocky or hard surfaces <b>to</b> <b>deposit</b> hundreds of thousands of eggs. One female pallid sturgeon caught in the upper Missouri River was estimated to be carrying 170,000 eggs, representing over 11 percent of its total body weight. After fertilization, pallid sturgeon eggs hatch in 5 to 8 days, after which the larvae drift back downstream for several weeks. As the larvae develop tails, they seek out slower-moving waterways and slowly mature over a period of a dozen years. The rate of survival to maturity for pallid sturgeon larvae is extremely low, and of {{the hundreds of thousands of}} eggs spawned, only a few live to adulthood.|$|E
5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues <b>to</b> <b>deposit</b> on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E
