5|$|Textual {{critics have}} had a {{challenging}} task in classifying the Codex, the exact relationship to other known texts and families is still disputed. The Greek text of the codex is of mixed text-types. It is {{a representative of the}} Byzantine text-type in <b>the</b> <b>Gospels</b> - the oldest examples of the type - {{and the rest of the}} New Testament books are of the Alexandrian text-type, with some Western readings. Kurt Aland placed it in Category III in <b>the</b> <b>Gospels,</b> and in Category I in rest of the books of the New Testament. The Byzantine text of <b>the</b> <b>Gospels</b> has a number of Alexandrian features, it has some affinities to the textual Family Π. Soden associated the text of <b>the</b> <b>gospels</b> with Family Π, though it is not a pure member of this family. According to Streeter, it is the earliest Greek manuscript which gives us approximately the text of Lucian the Martyr, but a small proportion of the readings seem to be earlier.|$|E
5|$|According to Kurt Aland it {{agrees with}} the Byzantine text-type 87 times in <b>the</b> <b>Gospels,</b> 13 times in the Acts, 29 times in Paul, and 16 times in the Catholic epistles.

It has 50 {{independent}} or distinctive readings in <b>the</b> <b>Gospels,</b> 11 in Acts, 17 in Paul, and 14 in the Catholic epistles. Aland placed {{the text of the}} codex in Category II. According to the Claremont Profile Method its text is mixed in Luke 1, Luke 10, and Luke 20.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{the authors}} of the New Testament showed little {{interest}} in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. As stated in , <b>the</b> <b>gospels</b> do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus. The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity, with timelines as a secondary consideration. In this respect, it is noteworthy that <b>the</b> <b>Gospels</b> devote about one third of their text to the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem, referred to as the Passion. Although <b>the</b> <b>gospels</b> do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, it is possible to draw from them a general picture of the life story of Jesus.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Enlightenment, <b>the</b> <b>gospels</b> {{were usually}} {{regarded}} as accurate historical accounts, {{but since then}} scholars have emerged who question the reliability of <b>the</b> <b>gospels</b> and draw {{a distinction between the}} Jesus described in <b>the</b> <b>gospels</b> and the Jesus of history. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them. While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus, and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life, the portraits of Jesus constructed by various scholars often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.|$|E
5|$|Scholars regard <b>the</b> <b>gospels</b> as {{compromised}} {{sources of}} information because the writers were trying to glorify Jesus.|$|E
50|$|The {{reading of}} <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> is usually preceded by the {{chanting}} of a prokimenon and/or alleluia. <b>The</b> <b>Gospel</b> lesson {{is not simply}} read, but is chanted {{by one of the}} higher clergy (deacon, priest, or bishop).

50|$|The three-source {{hypothesis}} {{is a candidate}} solution to the synoptic problem. It combines aspects of the two-source hypothesis and the Farrer hypothesis. It states that <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Matthew and <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Luke used <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Mark and a sayings collection as primary sources, but that <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Luke also used Gospel of Matthew as a subsidiary source.

5|$|In Aland's Profile, Kurt and Barbara Aland {{placed the}} codex's Gospels in Category III, meaning it has {{historical}} importance, with {{the profile of}} 1191, 802, 601/2, 69s.

There are 69 independent or distinctive readings in <b>the</b> <b>Gospels.</b> While <b>the</b> <b>Gospels</b> are a representative of the Caesarean text-type, the remainder of the books of the New Testament in this codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type and falls into Category V, the lowest and least important in Aland's Profile.|$|E
5|$|Jesus {{is called}} a τέκτων (tektōn) in , {{traditionally}} understood as carpenter but could cover makers of objects in various materials, including builders. <b>The</b> <b>gospels</b> indicate that Jesus could read, paraphrase, and debate scripture, {{but this does not}} necessarily mean that he received formal scribal training.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Gospel.</b> While <b>the</b> choir {{sings the}} Gradual and Alleluia (or Tract) the subdeacon carries the missal to <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> side of <b>the</b> altar where the priest will read <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> {{in a low}} voice.

50|$|Also {{like its}} predecessors, it runs in three-year cycles; <b>the</b> <b>gospel</b> {{readings}} in <b>the</b> first year (Year A) {{are taken from}} <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Matthew, those {{in the second year}} (or Year B) from <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Mark, and in the third year (or Year C) come from <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of Luke.

5|$|Some early Christian {{groups had}} {{separate}} {{descriptions of the}} life and teachings of Jesus that {{are not included in}} the New Testament. These include <b>the</b> <b>Gospels</b> of Thomas, Peter, and Judas, the Apocryphon of James, and many other apocryphal writings. Most scholars conclude that these are written much later and are less reliable accounts than the canonical gospels.|$|E
5|$|The first list {{fragment}} {{is followed}} by the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea. These tables, which predate the text of the Vulgate, were developed to cross-reference <b>the</b> <b>Gospels.</b> Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of <b>the</b> <b>Gospels.</b> The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most mediaeval copies of the Vulgate text of <b>the</b> <b>Gospels.</b> The tables in the Book of Kells, however, are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables {{in such a way as}} to make them confused. In addition, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text, making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon tables refer. The reason for the omission remains unclear: the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript's completion, or he may have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages.|$|E
5|$|The {{majuscule}} letters have elegant shape, but {{a little}} less simple {{than those in the}} Sinaiticus and Vaticanus codices. These letters, {{at the end of a}} line, are often very small, and much of the writing is very pale and faint. Punctuation is more frequent, usually on a level with the top of the preceding letter, while a vacant space, proportionate to the break in the sense, follows the end of a paragraph. At the end of each book the colophon is ornamented by pretty volutes from prima manu. There are found the Ammonian Sections with references to the Eusebian Canons stand in the margin of the text of <b>the</b> <b>Gospels.</b> It contains divisions into larger sections – κεφάλαια, the headings of these sections (τίτλοι) stand at the top of the pages. The places at which those sections commence are indicated throughout <b>the</b> <b>Gospels,</b> and in Luke and John their numbers are placed in the margin of each column. To all <b>the</b> <b>Gospels</b> (except Matthew, because of lacunae) is prefixed by a table of κεφάλαια (table of contents).|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of <b>the</b> Ebionites, <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of <b>the</b> Hebrews, and <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of <b>the</b> Nazarenes remains unclear. All <b>the</b> Jewish–Christian <b>gospels</b> survive only as fragments in quotations, {{so it is}} difficult to tell if they are independent texts or variations of each other. Scholar Albertus Klijn established the modern consensus, concluding that <b>the</b> <b>gospel</b> harmony composed in Greek appears to be a distinctive text known only to Epiphanius. Scholar Marie-Émile Boismard has claimed <b>the</b> Ebionite <b>gospel</b> is partly dependent upon a hypothetical Hebrew gospel as a source; however this conjecture remains a minority view. Its putative relationship to <b>the</b> <b>gospel</b> text known to Origen as <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> of <b>the</b> Twelve remains a subject of scholarly debate.|$|R

5|$|The {{unity of}} <b>the</b> <b>Gospels</b> is further {{emphasised}} by {{the decoration of}} the Eusebian canon tables. The canon tables themselves inherently illustrate the unity of <b>the</b> <b>Gospels</b> by organising corresponding passages from <b>the</b> <b>Gospels.</b> The Eusebian canon tables normally require twelve pages. In the Book of Kells, the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages (folios 1v through 7r) but for unknown reasons, condensed them into ten, leaving folios 6v and 7r blank. This condensation rendered the canon tables unusable. The decoration of the first eight pages of the canon tables is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean, where it was traditional to enclose the tables within an arcade (as seen in the London Canon Tables). The Kells manuscript presents this motif in an Insular spirit, where the arcades are not seen as architectural elements but rather become stylised geometric patterns with Insular ornamentation. The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches. The last two canon tables are presented within a grid. This presentation is limited to Insular manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow.|$|E
