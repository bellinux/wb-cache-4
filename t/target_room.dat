40|$|Purpose / Context - The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{prevention}} strategy against fungal attack in any residential building, which had been previously proposed and applied to conserve cultural assets using a fungal index. The strategy consisted of four stages: current status assessment, diagnosis, preventive measures, and finally confirmation of the preventive measure. In the current status assessment, the microclimates in a <b>target</b> <b>room</b> are to be evaluated firstly using the fungal index, which assesses the environmental conditions critical for fungal growth. The microclimates are diagnosed and categorized into the following three levels: A (free of contamination), B (probable contamination), or C (unavoidable contamination), depending on the index values 18, respectively. Suitable preventive measures are to be adopted at the sites with level B or C. After implementing the preventive measures, the fungal indices ought to be measured again for the evaluation of the employed preventive measure as well as the confirmation of level A. Methodology / Approach – One storeroom was selected as a <b>target</b> <b>room</b> to apply the approach, as a case study of the prevention strategy against fungal attack, including the diagnosis using fungal index values at the sites of interest, selection of a preventive measure, and the subsequent confirmation of the preventive measure. Results – Fungal index measurements throughout a period of one year as a current status assessment revealed that the microclimates in the <b>target</b> <b>room</b> were level B only in winter. As a preventive measure, a commercially available dehumidifying system was selected and installed in the <b>target</b> <b>room.</b> Fungal-index measurements confirmed that the room conditions had changed from level B to level A. Key Findings / Implications - The cause of level B in the <b>target</b> <b>room</b> was moisture invasion from the neighboring storeroom which had been air-conditioned at 20 °C and 55 % RH year-round, warmed and humidified in winter. The preventive measure implemented has completely suppressed fungal growth in the <b>target</b> <b>room.</b> This practical application of the strategy was successful. Originality - The phenomenon of moisture moving from warm and humidified rooms to cold and non-humidified ones will occur in any residential building in winter, resulting in mold contamination of cold wall surfaces. However, the systematic use of a fungal detector and fungal index will make the quantitative diagnosis of dampness possible, followed by the selection of a suitable preventive measure...|$|E

40|$|An upgrade of the {{existing}} ORNL Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) to the National Radioactive Ion Beam Isotope Separator On Line (RIB ISOL) Facility is being proposed. Part of the upgrade involves increasing the source proton energy and current, resulting in more intense, higher energy radiation. Shielding requirements for the proposed upgrade to the HRIBF have been assessed with respect to weight, space, and dose-rate constraints. Shielding assessments were made for operating, shutdown, and accident conditions. The results indicate reasonable shielding solutions for the <b>target</b> <b>room</b> except for the marginal dose rate on the roof. Shielding requirements in the <b>target</b> <b>room</b> were greatly reduced by decisions to move the target to a more interior room and to direct the proton beam downward into the target. A slightly more difficult shielding problem arises for proton beam extraction losses from the cyclotron. Here, the assumed isotropic beam losses (hence, neutron emissions) mean higher roof dose rates than those over the <b>target</b> <b>room</b> unless substantial localized shielding is placed over the cyclotron. Shutdown dose rates were found to present no problems. While dose rates through {{the sides of the}} facility during accident conditions will probably satisfy the accident dose-rate constraints, dose rates above the roof will be well above the constraints unless a solution is devised to shield the locations where beam losses are likely to occur.

Numerous methodologies {{have been proposed}} <b>targeting</b> <b>room</b> mode compensation to give an objectively even response across all listening locations. These techniques cannot guarantee, however, that every listener receives an equally pleasing subjective response.

The CSA system can alternatively be utilized to control listening locations independently, allowing each listener to adjust their localized low-frequency response to their liking. This alternate CSA implementation is evaluated using a bespoke finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm for small home theater applications...|$|R

In this work, we present an interactive design tool to create desirable floorplans by computationally conforming to such design constraints.

Based on user specifications, our system automatically generates multiple floor layouts with associated 3 D geometry that all satisfy the design specifications and constraints, thus exposing only the desirable family of interior layouts to the user. In this work, we focus on pre-cast concrete-based constructions, which lead to interesting discrete and continuous optimization possibilities.

We introduce three methods for combining the RSS and UWB data. By using UWB radios together with RSS sensors, it is still possible to localize a person through walls even when the devices are placed only on two sides of the target area. Including the data from the UWB radios can reduce the localization area of uncertainty by more than 60 %. Comment: 9 pages, conference submissio...|$|E
