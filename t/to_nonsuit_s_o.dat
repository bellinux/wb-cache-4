40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} Construction Grammar {{account of how}} the meaning of complex constructions, specifically, analytic causatives, emerges from an aggregation of simpler constructions, which individually have fairly abstract semantics, but which in combination encode very specific event types. The constructions investigated are make <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> V, have <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> V, have <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> Ving, get <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to V, force <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to V, set <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> (to) Ving, drive <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to V, move <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to V, lead <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to V, bring self to V, send <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> Ving, give <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to understand, and leave <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> Ving. Three causation event types are posited {{that are relevant to}} an analysis of analytic causative constructions: the MANIPULATE type, where an animate causer intentionally acts on a causee in a way that influences the causee such that he or she performs some activity; the TRIGGER type, where an event occurs which influences a causee such that, given the nature of the causee, the causee will inevitably undergo some process; and the PROMPT type, where an event occurs and a causee perceives this event and decides to react by performing some activity. Any given analytic causative encodes a more specific version of {{one or more of these}} event types. The two simple constructions that contribute most to a given analytic causative are causation verbs (make, have, get, etc.) and sentential complements (the bare infinitive, the to-infinitive, the present participle, etc.). Which event type(s) can be encoded by a given analytic causative does not depend on the causation verb or the sentential complement alone. Instead, particular combinations of the two yield meanings that are either compatible or incompatible with a given event type. Also discussed in the dissertation are the passivization of matrix or embedded clauses in analytic causatives, the relationship between causation verbs and their lexical sources, and the relationship between analytic causatives and transitive constructions with change-of-state or motion verbs...|$|R

40|$|National audienceThe {{fluorescence}} quenching by oxygen of vapors of nine polycyclic {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} with strongly different oxidation potentials 0. 44 eV < E ox < 1. 61 eV (anthracene, 9 -methylanthracene, 2 -aminoanthracene, 9, 10 -dibromanthracene, pyrene, chrysene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and carbazole) is studied. From the dependences of the fluorescence decay rates and intensities on the oxygen pressure P O 2, the quenching rate constants k <b>S</b> <b>O</b> 2 for the excited singlet states S 1 and the fraction f <b>S</b> <b>O</b> 2 of the S 1 states quenched by oxygen are estimated. At P O 2 = 5 Torr, the k <b>S</b> <b>O</b> 2 constants vary from 1. 2 × 107 to 3. 0 × 105 s− 1 Torr− 1, while the fraction of the quenched excited singlet states changes from 0. 1 (fluoranthene) to 0. 7 (chrysene) and 0. 8 (pyrene). The dependences of k <b>S</b> <b>O</b> 2 on the photophysical and electron-donor characteristics of the fluorescing compounds are analyzed. It is shown that, in the gas phase of anthracene and its derivatives, the magnitudes of k <b>S</b> <b>O</b> 2 are limited by the rate constants of gas-kinetic collisions k gk and do {{not depend on the}} electron-donor characteristics of fluorophores, while the fraction of quenched states f <b>S</b> <b>O</b> 2 changes with the oxidation potential. For compounds with k <b>S</b> <b>O</b> 2 < k gk, both the rate constants k <b>S</b> <b>O</b> 2 and the fraction of quenched states f <b>S</b> <b>O</b> 2 depend on the E ox of sensitizers, which demonstrates an important role played by the charge-transfer interactions in quenching of the S 1 states.

40|$|Abstract Background - Information {{about the}} Significant Others (<b>S.</b> <b>O.)</b> of 530 {{patients}} with mood and anxious spectrum disorders has been tabulated in this multicentre, retrospective, clinical observational study {{in order to}} learn the prevalence of the same mood and/or anxious spectrum diseases in the <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> of the patients. Methods - The 530 outpatients (of age range from 18 to 70 years) with mood and anxious spectrum disorders have been treated by the authors, observed for a seven year period (from January 1995 until May 2003). The patients live in 16 different Italian provinces, but are predominantly from Lombardia and Veneto. Mood disease (includes substance abuse) was present in 72 % of the patients and anxious disease was present in 28 % (DSM-IV diagnoses based upon clinical interviews). The <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> (various heterosexual long-term relationships) of each patient was interviewed for this study to establish a DSM-IV diagnosis of any psychiatric disease that might be present. In cases in which the patient had no <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> or in which information about the <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> was unavailable, that information was collected. As data was collected, 10 item report was completed for each patient and the respective <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> Results - Patients had an <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> with a similar mental disease to their own in 41 % of cases; only 16 % of the patients chose their <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> with no mental disease; 18 % of the patients did not have any <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> and in 26 % of the cases the health of the <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> was unknown. Conclusion - In this multicentre, retrospective, clinical observational study, the corresponding Significant Others of 530 patients with mood and anxious spectrum disorders presented with a high percentage of similar disease to the patients. These findings suggest that it may be appropriate to counsel our patients with these diseases to encourage their respective <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> to undergo a psychiatric evaluation for possible treatable disease: the first objective of an <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> is preventive care, secondarily the well-being of the partner may improve the treatment outcomes for the patient. Furthermore, eventual studies could demonstrate whether the disease of <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> precedes couple life (therefore a pre-existent cognitive functioning set out for the partner's choice) and whether it might stem from a difficult interpersonal relationship or chronic stress reaction to a life event. </p...|$|R
