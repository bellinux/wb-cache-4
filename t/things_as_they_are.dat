25|$|Buddhist teacher S.N. Goenka {{describes}} Buddhadharma as a 'pure {{science of}} mind and matter'. He claims Buddhism uses precise, analytical philosophical and psychological terminology and reasoning. Goenka's presentation describes Buddhism {{not so much as}} belief in a body of unverifiable dogmas, but an active, impartial, objective investigation of <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are.</b>|$|E

25|$|What is {{generally}} accepted in Buddhism is that effects arise from causation. From {{his very first}} discourse onwards, the Buddha explains the reality of things in terms of cause and effect. The existence of misery and suffering in any given individual {{is due to the}} presence of causes. One way to describe the Buddhist eightfold path is a turning towards the reality of <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> right now and understanding reality directly, although it is debated the degree to which these investigations are metaphysical or epistemological.|$|E

25|$|Mick and Stan's {{relationship}} {{starts to}} thaw, annoying Shirley. Mick attempts to reunite Shirley with her estranged son, Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo), with little success. Tina {{refers to the}} incident involving a young Mick in the bathtub, citing the event as happening after their mother left. This confuses Mick, and he concludes that it was Stan who tried to kill him and attacks him, prompting Shirley {{to admit that she}} had attempted to drown him. Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) finds out from Shirley that Mick is actually her son, his father is a man named Andy and her mother Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) concealed the pregnancy and brought Mick up as her and Stan's son. Shirley warns Phil not to tell Mick. Despite not being able to swim and having a phobia of water, Mick signs up to a sponsored swim in aid of his friend Billy Mitchell's (Perry Fenwick) young daughter, Janet Mitchell (Grace), who has Down's syndrome. He starts to learn at the local swimming pool, and confesses his fear to his friend, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Ian helps him overcome this fear and he makes progress. Linda tells Mick she wants another baby after she realises her children are too old to require her constant attention. Mick convinces Linda {{that this is not a}} good idea, but proposes to her, as they are not actually married, though their families think they are. Linda turns down the proposal, liking <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> and then she finds out that Dean has overheard this conversation.|$|E

Bacon was inspired by an image he described as [...] "haunting", and regarded Van Gogh as an alienated outsider, a position which resonated with him. Bacon identified with Van Gogh's theories of art and quoted lines written to Theo: [...] "eal painters do not paint <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are...</b> hey paint them as they themselves feel them to be." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} Allah jang Palsoe was written, stage {{performances}} were {{heavily influenced by}} orality. Contemporary theatres, such as bangsawan and stamboel, were unscripted and generally used fantastic settings and plotlines. Kwee Tek Hoay heavily disapproved of such whimsy, considering it [...] "better to say <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> than to create events out of nothing, which although perhaps more entertaining and satisfying to viewers or readers, are falsehoods and lies, going against the truth". After condemning contemporary playwrights who merely wrote down existing stories, Kwee Tek Hoay expressed the hope that ultimately a unique form of Chinese Malay theatre—inspired by European theatrical traditions but dealing with Chinese themes—could be developed. Allah jang Palsoe {{was intended to be}} the first published stage play in this new tradition.|$|E

[...] He was highly critical of contemporary writers who relied more on their fantasies than logic and truth. [...] Hoping to keep his story grounded in reality, Kwee researched {{the history of the}} Baduy, the geological formation of Krakatoa, and the events of 1883 and 1928; in total he consulted 15 books, all in English or Dutch. Writing began on 19 March 1928 and was completed on 28 May of that year. Drama dari Krakatau consists of sixteen chapters, which were spread over 125 pages in the first printing.|$|E

[...] For the track, she initially asked American rapper Jay Z to be featured on with verses about icons, however he called American rapper Chance the Rapper and said {{that it would be better}} if somebody that was a new person and that he thought that could be a new icon got on the record. Chance and Madonna had met before through American recording artist Frank Ocean in a concert and became friends, prompting the singer to accept Jay Z's suggestion.|$|E

On February 9, 2015, the singer released three other finished tracks, including the final version of [...] "Joan of Arc", as well as the album's track list.|$|E
