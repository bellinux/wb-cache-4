40|$|Resource {{allocation}} is {{the problem}} of allocating a set of resources to accomplish some task(s). Many real-world problems are resource-allocation problems, such as production planning and manpower planning. This paper reports on a case study on applying constraint-satisfaction techniques to solve a real-world resource allocation problem, referred to as the Railway <b>Track</b> <b>Possession</b> Assignment Problem, using the CHIP constraint language. The problem is to assign railway tracks to a given set of scheduled maintenance tasks according to a set of constraints. The manual problem-solving method is heuristic in nature. Experienced personnel were involved in the manual process. An expert system, called the Engineering Work <b>Track</b> <b>Possession</b> Assignment System (EWTPAS), was developed to carry out the assignment using constraint-satisfaction techniques. A new, two-phase resource allocation strategy based on constraint relaxation was developed and implemented in EWTPAS. EWTPAS succeeded in replacing the manual assignment process after test running for 1 year. EWTPAS is now in use. Besides having the advantage of being free of careless human errors, and the advantage of being independent of the availability of experienced staff, EWTPAS was found to be about 10 times more efficient than the manual method. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The proposed approach is tested on a real-life case study from the Danish railway infrastructure manager. The results show that, in 2 h of computing time, the approach is able to provide solutions that are within 0. 37 % of the optimal one for six different blocking proposals and two alternative construction providers, {{so it can be}} used as an effective support tool in the primary planning stage to suggest preferable track possessions within the existing railway services...|$|E
40|$|The {{expansion}} of economic activities and increasing mobility {{of people on}} short, medium and long distance trips {{is an issue that}} requires attention in the transport industry. The need to address this demanding issue in a sustainable and economically efficient way is the core of general capacity challenge in railway industries. This informs the strategic objective of ensuring an efficient and competitive mode of transportation by many infrastructure managers including Swedish Transport Administration. An aspect of railway infrastructure management which is promising for the enhancement of existing infrastructure capacity is the improvement of maintenance process. The frequency of traffic interruption due to infrastructure failure, reduction of functional performance due to infrastructure degradation and length of <b>track</b> <b>possession</b> time are incidences limiting operational availability of railway infrastructure and capacity thereof. Achieving the goal of supporting the inherent capacity of existing railway infrastructure requires implementation of effective & efficient practices for large and small impact maintenance tasks. This research has addressed the above mentioned concerns by studying the opportunities which maintenance presents towards enhancing the capacity of existing railway infrastructure. Outsourcing aspect of maintenance organisation has been studied and a conceptual framework to facilitate the implementation of performance based maintenance contracting is proposed. This will enable the achievement of quantity and quality requirements of traffic performance. Furthermore a risk assessment procedure has been presented to identify bottlenecks restricting the capacity on any line and also for continuous improvement has been suggested. A model for planning and scheduling of tamping action has been presented. This will lead to reduced <b>track</b> <b>possession</b> time and minimum cost of intervention while geometry quality is kept at desirable level. Case studies on the above procedures and model have been presented to demonstrate their application for maintenance improvement. The outcome of this study is development of effective maintenance principles that should serve as basis for maintenance improvement programme to support reliable and inherent capacity of existing railway network. This improvement covers organisational and technical performance, all enhancing the possibility to increase the capacity of railway network.

40|$|The {{continually}} {{increasing demand}} on railway service {{in terms of}} {{the quantity and quality of}} both passenger and freight train operations is the core of the general railway capacity challenge. Moreover, this challenge has been the driver for some improvements in the technical system, traffic operation & management as well as maintenance process, although the room for improvement in the maintenance function is still large. An effective capacity management entails critical study of the three essential capacity parameters: infrastructure, traffic and operating parameters. To further explore the fundamentals of capacity management, this paper investigates some essential issues on railway infrastructure capacity. A review of the general railway infrastructure capacity challenge and management is presented, including some strategic measures to enhance capacity and quality of service of existing infrastructure. We have proposed maintenance improvement framework to explore the opportunity of improving the capacity situation on a network. This framework will facilitate the identification of both critical systems and activities with the largest impact on the capacity and also some root causes for critical system.

40|$|Railway {{transportation}} is a sustainable {{mode of transportation}} for reasons of safety, cost, carbon emission and energy requirements. It has a notable role in economic expansion in terms of passenger and freight services. In recent years, {{there has been a}} continuous demand to increase the competitiveness of railway transport via quantity and quality of service delivered. For instance there is a growing need to shift a substantial volume of freight and passenger traffic to rail. To meet the demand for enhanced railway infrastructure capacity, large modification of the infrastructure, improvement of traffic planning process and improvement of maintenance and renewal process are required. The obvious solution would be capital expansion of infrastructure but this is a long-term cost-intensive approach for improving railway transport performance. This, therefore makes successive improvement of maintenance and renewal (M&R) process an ideal and feasible way of improving availability, capacity and service quality of existing railway infrastructure. This thesis addresses improvements in maintenance to enhance capacity and service quality through systematic maintenance analysis for effective planning and maintenance optimisation for efficient scheduling. This thesis is divided into two parts: the first part deals with maintenance analysis and the second addresses maintenance optimisation. Both parts are aimed at enhancing maintenance effectiveness by improving <b>track</b> <b>possession</b> utilisation and infrastructure integrity. The first part suggests assessment and analysis methods to support continuous improvement of railway infrastructure performance. It entails the use of historical operation and maintenance data to identify, improve and eliminate weak links and bottlenecks. The second part deals with planning and scheduling of maintenance tasks from condition deterioration viewpoint. This part uses infrastructure condition data with model driven approaches to schedule maintenance tasks with the aim of ensuring efficient use of <b>track</b> <b>possession</b> time and maximisation of availability and capacity. First, a fuzzy inference system is developed for computing the integrity index or composite indicator to relate maintenance functions to capacity situation. This is a good measure of the M&R need on a line as imposed by operational profile, capacity consumption and adopted maintenance strategy. It provides additional information {{that can be used to}} support high level M&R decisions for enhanced capacity. Second, risk matrix and an adapted criticality analysis method are proposed for identifying weak links and critical assemblies/items that are bottlenecks limiting operational capacity and serviceGodkänd; 2015; 20150420 (stefam); Nedanstående person kommer att disputera för avläggande av teknologie doktorsexamen.

40|$|HSRs are {{a complex}} system {{not only in}} terms of {{technical}} specifications, but also with respect to operations and maintenance over the track structure. Also, track structure is basically considered as the most important and costly railway asset. Its maintenance is vital to assure safety and operating practices are also of great importance to assure that a good level of service is provided. Considering track maintenance considerations over a new HSR line, one important and critical feature is the operational regime and the question of whether the line will be operated as mixed (passenger and freight) or dedicated only to passenger traffic. This can influence the maintenance patterns: preventive maintenance planning, maintenances scheduling and assignment issues. This will be different for the dedicated and mixed HSR traffic scenarios. In this research, the main approach is focused on the interactions between track maintenance planning and operational concerns and influences in these two scenarios. With this aim and within the current paper, a model of the preventive maintenance scheduling problem (PMSP) has been selected initially from Budai (2006) and then an upgraded revision of this model (Multi-segment assignment and scheduling of preventive maintenance problem) is introduced. Furthermore, the upgraded model of PMSP has been run over a given HSR line (Tehran-Qom HSR corridor in Iran) based on the comparison between the two scenarios of dedicated HSR and upgraded mixed HSR patterns. The main requirements, similarities and differences between these two scenarios are analyzed based on preventive maintenance scheduling and assignment requisites and interactions over the operating restrictions and considerations such as <b>track</b> <b>possession</b> patterns for maintenance activities. We conclude that decision making between these two scenarios through PMSP modeling are quite complicated and depends on the technical and operational specifications of the given HSR corridor, although some general comments on tradeoffs are possible...|$|E

To efficiently utilise this new kind of information one task within the ACEM-Rail project {{is the development of}} methods for planning predictive maintenance tasks along with preventive and corrective ones in a mid-term planning horizon.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors {{consider}} the possibility and provide specific solutions to create the automated system of track maintenance on the example of automation of technological operations to restore the equal elasticity of the undersleeper foundation. The relevance of the work {{stems from the fact}} that the modern and perspective requirements to the track maintenance in the conditions of the transition to high-speed, high-speed, high-tonnage traffic can be implemented only by switching to a new system of track maintenance based on the performance of work of specialized high-performance machines and on the new system with maximum opportunity for automation technology. More than half of the volume of works on the current maintenance of the tracks are the works on the removal of splashes, straightening and tamping of track, the technology of which can be divided into two components: calculation-evaluation and the generation of control actions on the railway track. Track machines are used extensively at the local bearing places of the occurrence of splashes on track sections or for continuous bearing plot ways to restore the equal elasticity of the undersleeper base and reduce the degree of non-uniformity deviations in rails’ position on level and in plan, as well as track subsidence. The bunker for filling the ballast may be mounted on additional frame or on offset brackets of the machine. The device for measuring the position of a railway track includes the means for measuring the deflections of the road, bending rise the track in the longitudinal profile and the position of the track on level (elevation of one rail in relation to another) and the adjacent block determining the actual position of a railway track in plan, in longitudinal profile and on level. The block of determining the amount of ballast consists of interconnected devices for determining the value of shifts and raise of the track and the block of comparing the track raise values with determining the amount necessary for filling of ballast. A device for determining the magnitudes of the shifts and the track raise consists of the interconnected unit for comparing the actual position of the track with a given (estimated) position of the track and a block determining the values of the track shifts and raise, which also provides the conversion of the recorded deflections of the track in the longitudinal profile in the track subsidence. The block comparing the track raise values with determining the amount necessary for filling the ballast, compares the magnitude of the track raise, determines changes in the transverse area of a prism in case of track raise and determines the amount needed for ballast filling.

40|$|Despite rail {{transport}} being {{known as the}} most energy efficient method of land transport, rail has mostly been losing its market share of general freight transport. Australian railways {{have an opportunity to}} improve their performance and meet the challenges of the 21 st century by improving the energy efficiency of services, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving distribution networks and providing generally lower transport costs. A particular challenge is older infrastructure and networks with lower utilisation. It is generally understood that the geometry of railway track constructed in the 1800 ’s, (including inter alia, numerous small radius curves, steeper grades and substandard formation) would require additional maintenance funding and needs more frequent <b>track</b> maintenance <b>possessions</b> to ensure the track is maintained at the required standard. However the level of maintenance would be dependent on the volume and types of train configurations travelling on the network. As each train type applies a different, quantifiable level of track damage for a given track geometry, and as the cost to repair/maintain this track is known, then it is possible to develop a transparent cost model to estimate the incremental infrastructure costs for each train type. Therefore, a wear/damage model is proposed based on data derived from train simulations and track degradation analysis. This model provides railway infrastructure managers with an indication of their expected maintenance budget based on train types (parameters, configurations), operational requirements (volumes, speeds) and the local track geometry (track layout, ballast/formation parameters and rail profile) ...|$|R
40|$|Infrastructure {{managers}} (IMs) need to {{plan their}} maintenance work about 1 ½– 2 years before a new train time table (TTT) comes into force to minimise {{the effect on}} traffic. Maintenance work that is planned in less than 1 year ahead of the TTT has to compete with, or need to be fitted into, operators’ applications for capacity. However, maintenance work is at times planned {{only a few weeks}} before execution, and depending on the railway line in question, a few hours during night can be available for maintenance. In addition, sudden failures in track normally require repair immediately or within a day. If rail transportation increases, it also becomes harder to find time in track for maintenance. Therefore, it is of interest to simulate maintenance tasks between trains to minimise <b>track</b> maintenance <b>possession</b> time. Such simulation can be used to: study maintenance work in TTTs with random and regular train departures; study the effect of exceeding allocated maintenance windows; and to study the effect of increase in train frequency.

Even if train operations allow sufficient <b>track</b> and vehicle <b>possession</b> time, testing {{is limited by the}} time required to apply the friction modifiers. Using vehicle simulation it is possible to test a wide variety of curvatures, curve designs and bogie types, as well as variable wheel rail profiles and friction conditions providing curving performance measures such as wear indices and lateral rail head forces.

The study was conducted by CRE on behalf of QR {{as a part of the}} Train Dynamics Management Program. The results agree with field measurements that rail head friction modification produces considerable benefits in wear reduction on very tight curvatures. The further simulations on medium and gentle curves, however, show the benefits from top-of-rail friction modification are small for medium and gentle curves, and the benefits are dependent on the passive steering features of the bogie and the wheel-rail profile and flange friction conditions. The paper presents the results of several different conditions of curvature, and wheel rail profile conicity. These results are discussed in view of developing guidelines for effective placement of friction modifier compounds...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe rail {{industry}} in the UK is undergoing substantial changes {{in response to a}} modernisation vision for 2040. Development and implementation of these will lead to a highly automated and safe railway. Real-time regulation of traffic will optimise the performance of the network, with trains running in succession within an adjacent movable safety zone. Critically, maintenance will use intelligent trainborne and track-based systems. These will provide accurate and timely information for condition based intervention at precise <b>track</b> locations, reducing <b>possession</b> downtime and minimising the presence of workers in operating railways. Clearly, precise knowledge of trains’ real-time location is of paramount importance. The positional accuracy demand of the future railway is less than 2 m. A critical consideration of this requirement is the capability to resolve train occupancy in adjacent tracks, with the highest degree of confidence. A finer resolution is required for locating faults such as damage or missing parts, precisely. Location of trains currently relies on track signalling technology. However, these systems mostly provide an indication of the presence of trains within discrete track sections. The standard Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), cannot precisely and reliably resolve location as required either. Within the context of the needs of the future railway, state of the art location technologies and systems were reviewed and critiqued. It was found that no current technology is able to resolve location as required. Uncertainty is a significant factor. A new integrated approach employing complimentary technologies and more efficient data fusion process, can potentially offer a more accurate and robust solution. Data fusion architectures enabling intelligent self-aware rail-track maintenance systems are proposed...|$|R
