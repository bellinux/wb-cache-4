5|$|The {{prototype}} and series trains have various differences. The {{number of}} seats was increased from 264 to 309 by changing the seat configuration in second class from 2+1 to 2+2. The information screens {{on the outside of}} the carriages were moved from the center of the carriages <b>to</b> <b>next</b> to the doors. There are also differences with the light switch logic, which often leads to the trains running with both front and tail lights on at the same end. The prototypes differed also originally by their restaurant car and Extra class features. They were modified in the mid-2000s to be similar to the series trains.|$|E

25|$|The {{toxicity}} of PCBs varies considerably among congeners. The coplanar PCBs, known as nonortho PCBs {{because they are}} not substituted at the ring positions ortho <b>to</b> (<b>next</b> to) the other ring, (i.e. PCBs 77, 126, 169, etc.), tend to have dioxin-like properties, and generally are among the most toxic congeners. Because PCBs are almost invariably found in complex mixtures, the concept of toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) has been developed to facilitate risk assessment and regulation, where more toxic PCB congeners are assigned higher TEF values on a scale from 0 to 1. One of the most toxic compounds known, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, a PCDD, is assigned a TEF of 1.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of Dreamscape players are given a diary, in {{which most of the}} pages are empty except for titles at the top of each page. The titles {{themselves}} are named after all the locations that can be visited throughout the game world, and as such players can use this to work out where they have to go <b>to</b> <b>next.</b> As the story processes the pages of the diary slowly fill up, giving extra information about the locations found in the game. It also provides back story to not only the main character, Wilson, but to the other characters as well. The diary also contains a map, which is designed to help players navigate the thirty acre world.|$|E
25|$|Fire and Darkness was {{developed}} by Singularity Software, an American studio composed of seven individuals. David Scherer, Adam Stubblefield and David Rosenthal started working on the game as early as 1996, with Mark Feghali helping them craft the networking engine featured in the game. Ari Heitner later joined the team, focusing on the game's user interface, sound code and scenario design. Ian Dale served as the main artist of the game, and Austin Huang provided the music. According to Scherer and Rosenthal, the game was done within three years, with the team mostly working in summer given {{that all of them}} attended either high school or college. According <b>to</b> <b>Next</b> Generation magazine, no money was spent producing the game.|$|E

25|$|The Packers have an {{exceptionally}} loyal fan base. Regardless of team performance, every game played in Green Bay {{has been sold}} out since 1960. Despite the Packers having by far the smallest local TV market, the team consistently {{ranks as one of}} the most popular in the NFL. They also have one of the longest season ticket waiting lists in professional sports, 86,000 names long, more than there are seats at Lambeau Field. The average wait is said to be over 30 years, but with only 90 or so tickets turned over annually it would be 955 years before the newest name on the list got theirs. As a result, season tickets are willed <b>to</b> <b>next</b> of kin and newborns placed optimistically on the waiting list.|$|E
25|$|Notably, {{it was not}} as if Italians {{had never}} {{migrated}} before, internal migration between North and Southern Italy before unification was common. Northern Italy caught on to the global industrialization sooner than Southern Italy, therefore it was considered more modern technologically, and tended to be inhabited by the bourgeoisie. Alternatively, rural and agro-intensive Southern Italy was seen as economically backward and was mainly populated by lower class peasantry. Given these disparities, prior to unification (and arguably after) the two sections of Italy, North and South were essentially seen by Italians and other nations as separate countries. So, migrating from one part of Italy <b>to</b> <b>next</b> could be seen as though they were indeed migrating to another country or even continent.|$|E
25|$|All four aspects may drive SA processes. Being {{aware of}} the status of {{particular}} objects (cues), one might infer that particular situations are on-going, and frame the objects accordingly. The cues then drive re-framing of situations. Having a particular frame, or pre-conception of a situation, this may drive the perception of objects. E.g. having noticed that a landing is about to occur, an Air Traffic Controller will usually look for specific objects in the environment and update the awareness of their status. Further, having realized the implications of objects of their status, this drives the process of what to attend <b>to</b> <b>next.</b> E.g. knowing that a vehicle is approaching a runway where a landing is about to take place, an Air Traffic Controller may monitor its progress. Event horizon awareness may also guide SA, e.g. if one plans to stop the car at a gas station, one may look for gas station signs.|$|E
