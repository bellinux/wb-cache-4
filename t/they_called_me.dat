Rimmer and Morgan, however, are not credited in the closing titles. Files recalls that he felt honoured {{to be asked to}} rejoin the Andersons for another production following Captain Scarlet, and that he was [...] "tickled pink" [...] to be performing with Davies, adding, [...] "I hated the way that so many so-called producers wouldn't meet his eye. He was Maigret forever, you see, in their eyes." [...] Morgan, meanwhile, explains how she was contracted for her single voice role in Joe 90: [...] "They needed a voice, they called around and everyone else was out shopping. So <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> in." ...|$|E
500|$|Carey co-wrote and co-produced {{the song}} [...] "Whenever You Call" [...] with {{longtime}} collaborator Walter Afanasieff for her album, Butterfly. However, {{in order to}} change the song's tempo and format, Carey decided to re-do the song as a duet with Brian McKnight, because she felt {{it was one of}} the best songs on Butterfly. Carey had also expressed how McKnight's vocals added a great deal to the song, describing the project as [...] "perfecting the song". McKnight shared similar sentiments, saying, [...] "It was amazing to go into the studio with someone who's so successful, and has that kind of track record. Mariah is someone who could ask anyone in the world to sing with her, and <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>me.</b> The album contains a duet with Whitney Houston ... it's just been great company to be in." ...|$|E

He met a One Life to Live casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he [...] "auditioned just like everybody else". He [...] "made it to callbacks, and [...] got the part". Howarth said, [...] "I was hired... to plant drugs in Jason Webb's jacket. All I knew was that my first name was Todd. I don't know what happened next. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> in again and suddenly I had a last name 'Manning.' Then I get called to read another day." ...|$|E

2500|$|Noel Gallagher was {{an early}} {{champion}} of the band, inviting them to support at Oasis’ historic Knebworth concerts, but from the outset of their career, Kula Shaker polarised UK media opinion. This arguably stemmed from age old British preconceptions about class and race. Not only were they white youngsters singing about Krishna in Sanskrit, they were seen as coming from privileged middle class backgrounds. Speaking {{in an interview in}} 2016, Mills says [...] "When I was in private schools, <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> 'common', and when I was in state schools <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> 'posh'. It made me very cynical about all these labels." [...] At the height of Britpop, and 'lager culture', music publications like Melody Maker, Select, and NME often focused on the class angle and ridiculed Kula's fascination with Indian culture. Mills commented in 2016: [...] "The musical styles on K are mainstream now. [...] people didn't know how to understand it or where to place it, so all that was left to do was deride it." ...|$|E
