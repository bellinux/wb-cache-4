5|$|The main backfield {{positions}} are <b>the</b> <b>quarterback</b> (QB), halfback/tailback (HB/TB) and fullback (FB). <b>The</b> <b>quarterback</b> {{is the leader}} of the offense. Either he or a coach calls the plays. Quarterbacks typically inform the rest of the offense of the play in the huddle before the team lines up. <b>The</b> <b>quarterback</b> lines up behind the center to take the snap and then hands the ball off, throws it or runs with it.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} ways that the offense can advance the ball: running and passing. In a typical play, <b>the</b> <b>quarterback</b> calls the play, and the center passes the ball {{backwards}} and under his legs to <b>the</b> <b>quarterback</b> in {{a process known as}} the snap. <b>The</b> <b>quarterback</b> then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball or runs with it himself. The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes out of bounds, or a pass hits the ground without a player having caught it. A forward pass can only be legally attempted if the passer is behind the line of scrimmage. In the NFL, a down also ends if the runner's helmet comes off.|$|E
