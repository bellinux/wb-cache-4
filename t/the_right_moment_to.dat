The undercarriage consisted of a long pneumatically-sprung ash skid under the nose and a rubber-sprung tail skid. For take-off a jettisonable two-wheeled dolly {{was attached to the}} front skid. As with all drop-off dollies it was important to release the dolly at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> avoid the dolly bouncing into the structure, causing damage.

25|$|Görgei was so {{angered by}} the partial failure of that days {{military}} actions (although the Hungarian advancement, they could not breach the enemy lines, deciding {{the fate of the}} battle), that he dismissed Knezić from the lead of the III. corps because of his passivity, but also Asbóth from the lead of the II. corps, although he was the only corps commander, who accomplished his tasks. Allegedly Görgei was angered of him because his troops suffered too many losses during their attack. In their place were put: Colonel József Kászonyi in the lead of the II. corps, and Colonel Károly Leiningen-Westerburg in the lead of the III. corps. While Leiningen will demonstrate to be an excellent choice, Kászonyi's appointment in the place of Asbóth, will show to be an unlucky choice. To change the corps commanders {{in the middle of a}} battle, was also a bad decision, but maybe the worst thing was that he did not kept under a direct control and observation his corps commanders - especially the hesitating Knezić - in order to make them to move in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> the battlefield.

25|$|Cartagena, {{one of the}} {{principal}} cities in the New World Spanish Empire, {{was one of the first}} to rebel against the Spanish yoke. In the early 19th century, a few white Criollos, e.g., locally born people of Spanish ancestry, were given a classical education, some of them in Santa Fe, and a few even in Europe, and had begun to excel in literature and the arts, as well as professions such as medicine, law and the natural sciences. In the course of their studies, they had been exposed to liberal ideas of liberty and equality, and as they increasingly developed an identity as Hispanic Americans, they chafed at their secondary status in the Spanish colonial caste system to the Peninsulares, or Spanish-born Spaniards. Consequently, many of the Criollos began to think it was time to take the reins of government into their own hands, whatever the outcome of the war with Spain that was sure to result. They did not act immediately, however, as they awaited <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> strike. Meanwhile, the long-established colonial social order in Cartagena was being undermined by the ideas of the libertarians (meaning the patriotic defenders of liberty). The final blow to bring down the royalist government, the coup de grace dreamed of by the patriots, would not be accomplished easily, as the city was a formidable base of Spanish power, and had entrenched political, military, religious and administrative bureaucracies.|$|E
50|$|When {{employing}} {{an affinity}} marketing program {{it is not}} always assured that the scheme is going to succeed. It {{is due to the fact}} that some organizations totally refuse to endorse the brand of a company and consider such a partnership as a violation of their dignity. A total affinity marketing scheme failure is also explained by a bad timing in the sense that some companies choose to target the customers at the wrong time. For example, summer and Christmas are not <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> focus on pupils and academic staff because of the holiday. Another reason for this lack of success is that the target audience's income is not sufficient for the products offered. Moreover, many affinity marketing efforts fail to tailor the promoted goods and services to that affinity group's specific needs.|$|R

5000|$|The {{origins of}} {{electromechanical}} inverters explain {{the source of}} the term inverter. Early AC-to-DC converters used an induction or synchronous AC motor direct-connected to a generator (dynamo) so that the generator's commutator reversed its connections at exactly <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> produce DC. A later development is the synchronous converter, in which the motor and generator windings are combined into one armature, with slip rings at one end and a commutator at the other and only one field frame. The result with either is AC-in, DC-out. With an M-G set, the DC can be considered to be separately generated from the AC; with a synchronous converter, in a certain sense it can be considered to be [...] "mechanically rectified AC". Given <b>the</b> <b>right</b> auxiliary and control equipment, an M-G set or rotary converter can be [...] "run backwards", converting DC to AC. Hence an inverter is an inverted converter.|$|R

[...] Unlike the Joker, however, Gordon emerges from his ordeal with his sanity and moral code intact. The story is also famous for changing how the Modern Age of Comics perceived Batman comics by bringing it back to its darker roots. The comic book, however, delves deeper in order to present Batman's own psychology - that he is, in his own way, just as insane as the Joker, and that he and the Joker perceive the world according to differing points of view, with the Joker's interpreted through a joke.|$|E

Stephen Thomas Erlewine in a retrospective review in Allmusic felt that Jennings had been looking for a musical approach which had roots in country and rock, and Shaver's songs – [...] "sketching an outlaw stance with near defiance and borrowing rock attitude to create the hardest country tunes imaginable" [...] – provided that common ground. Erlewine believed that the album arrived at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> revive the honky tonk music of Nashville by injecting a rock and roll attitude that would produce outlaw country.|$|E

500|$|The {{novel is}} {{cited as a}} factor in the success of the civil rights {{movement}} in the 1960s, however, in that it [...] "arrived at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> help the South and the nation grapple with the racial tensions (of) the accelerating civil rights movement". Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement, despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them. Civil Rights leader Andrew Young comments that part of the book's effectiveness is that it [...] "inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion" [...] and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set. Young views the novel as [...] "an act of humanity" [...] in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices. Alabama author Mark Childress compares it to the impact of Uncle Tom's Cabin, a book that is popularly implicated in starting the U.S. Civil War. Childress states the novel [...] "gives white Southerners a way to understand the racism that they've been brought up with and to find another way. And most white people in the South were good people. Most white people in the South were not throwing bombs and causing havoc... I think the book really helped them come to understand what was wrong with the system in the way that any number of treatises could never do, because it was popular art, because it was told from a child's point of view." ...|$|E

40|$|The present {{document}} has {{the objective}} of analyzing the impact of several factors {{that are part of}} mobile telecom markets into the feasibility of sharing resources as a strategy for operators to deploy their networks in a cost-efficient manner and cope with the ever increasing amount of data traffic. These factors include the situation of the operators with their distribution of market shares, the nature of national regulatory authorities, and their lines of action. The study comprises the description and analysis of three markets: Ecuador, Chile, and Sweden, as they pose very different scenarios and are useful to prove the contrast present in two different regions of the world. The results of this research work show that in order to ease the adoption of network sharing in a market, a state of fair competition must be encouraged, reflected by a good distribution of market shares between operators. This is for the most part a task of the regulators, as they must make sure to award resources to operators in an equitable manner, as well as <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> introduce new actors into the market, as it is observed in the cases of Chile and Sweden.

5000|$|Broadcast 19 December 1990, {{the final}} {{instalment}} illustrates how species fulfil their ultimate raison d'être {{and ensure that}} their genes are {{passed on to the}} next generation. It is a universal problem, but one which has given rise to a variety of solutions. Barnacles cannot move, but each has both male and female sex cells, allowing each neighbour to be a potential mate. On {{the other end of the}} scale, a female elephant undergoes a long pregnancy — 22 months — and so wishes to ensure that her calf is fathered by a strong and proven male. She is therefore very choosy about her partner. A female chinchilla is even more so, and rejects an unwanted suitor by squirting urine in its face. Mating is a dangerous business when weapons are involved, and a male tarantula approaches his intended with trepidation. Only when he succeeds in holding off her poison fangs is he able to progress any further. For some, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> get together are few and far between: a male crab, for example, must wait until a female moults her shell before he is able to fertilise her.
