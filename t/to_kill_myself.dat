2500|$|An early draft {{included}} an additional chapter set after the confrontation with Vernita {{in which the}} Bride has a gunfight with Gogo Yubari's vengeful sister Yuki. The scene was cut for time and budget reasons. Tarantino said: [...] "I'm dealing with a three and a half-hour movie. Yuki's revenge {{is going to be}} the first to go. I'm going <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>myself</b> shooting it, it's going to cost $1 million and it's going to be the first thing to go, so I can't do it." [...] Another draft featured a scene in which the Bride's [...] "Pussy Wagon" [...] is blown up by Elle Driver.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2005–06 {{television}} season, Leguizamo {{joined the}} cast of the show ER, playing the emotionally disturbed Dr. Victor Clemente, a new attending who is keen on introducing the staff of County General to better ways of treating patients and cutting-edge technology. Clemente, however, was plagued with personal problems and was fired from the hospital {{near the end of}} the season. Dr. Clemente's departure from the show was a blessing for Leguizamo. He revealed to CraveOnline that he was not happy working on the television program. [...] "I was depressed doing ER," [...] he admitted, [...] "I started gaining weight, I was eating doughnuts, I started smoking again. I’m eating McDonald's, things that I know when I’m depressed I do. I tried <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>myself</b> internally." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do {{not know}} Jean le Roi," [...] he said. [...] "To him it is a pastime <b>to</b> <b>kill!</b> For <b>myself</b> I {{do not know}} the passions as he would know them. Where there was money I would not kill. It would be as you have said--there are other ways. But Jean le Roi is different." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hoped {{you were}} a soldier," [...] the peasant said, as he lowered his stick. [...] "I should like <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> one, and then <b>to</b> be <b>killed</b> <b>myself.</b> My God, what is life worth living for in this unhappy country? Three times {{since the war began}} has our village been burned, but each time we were warned of the {{approach}} of the plunderers, and escaped in time. Yesterday they came when I was away, and see what they have done;" [...] and he pointed to his wife and child, and to the corpses scattered about.|$|R
5000|$|My wartime {{experiences}} are nothing {{to make a}} splash about ... I'm just an ex-soldier who did his job. I never saw the faces of those I killed. They were just men in an enemy uniform. It was simply them or me. I don't think I was brave—not {{any more than the}} other Aussies who were with me. I simply had a job to do and I did it ... Only afterwards did I realise how lucky I'd been not <b>to</b> get <b>killed</b> <b>myself.</b> Walter Peeler ...|$|R
2500|$|Kahlo's {{right leg}} was amputated {{at the knee}} due to {{gangrene}} in August 1953. She became severely depressed and anxious, and her dependency on painkillers escalated. When Rivera began yet another affair, she attempted suicide by overdose. She wrote in her diary in February 1954 that [...] "they have given me centuries of torture and at moments I almost lost my reason. I keep on wanting <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>myself.</b> Diego is what keeps me from it, through my vain idea that he would miss me. ... But {{never in my life}} have I suffered more. I will wait a while..." [...] She was again hospitalized in April and May. That spring, she resumed painting after a one-year interval. Her last paintings include the political Marxism Will Give Health to the Sick (c. 1954) and Frida and Stalin (c. 1954), and the still-life Viva La Vida (1954).|$|E
2500|$|Within {{a week of}} his wedding, Wedge {{had been}} {{committed}} to the psychiatric ward in the Highland Hospital in Oakland, California for observation after admitting to an alienist {{that he had been}} obsessed with either strangling his new wife or defenestrating her during their honeymoon. Wedge also confessed that [...] "for several months I have been fighting a desire <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>myself.</b> For weeks I would want to slash my throat every time I picked up a razor. Every time I looked out of a high window I wanted to jump out. I am a sick man and for my own protection and for the protection of my loved ones I want to be locked up and be placed where I can harm neither myself or anyone else". Wedge believed his condition was caused by damage caused by a frontal skull fracture sustained in a saloon fight about 1899, and exacerbated by the stress caused by the publicity surrounding his wedding and resignation from the church.|$|E
2500|$|Alice {{claimed to}} feel regret about {{shooting}} de Trafford, who {{was said to}} be on the brink of death, but did not offer an explanation, telling a police official who was permitted to see her: [...] "I decided to shoot him just as the train was leaving. Why is my own secret. Don't ask me." [...] De Trafford finally regained consciousness and made a brief statement. In an effort to protect Alice, he explained: [...] "Why, Madame attempted suicide. I tried to stop her and the weapon was accidentally discharged. A deplorable accident, surely... but yet, an accident!" [...] before lapsing into unconsciousness again. De Janzé's condition quickly improved and she was first able to talk with relatives on 30 March. She officially confessed to the shootings in a signed statement on 2 April, in which she admitted to having attempted suicide numerous times in her life, declaring: [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>myself,</b> for I have always had ideas of suicide. From time to time, and without reason, I have wanted to die".|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I stay--here, {{under this}} roof, where anon--in a few hours--Victor de Marmont will have claims upon you which, if he {{exercised}} them before me {{would make me}} wish <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him or <b>myself.</b> I shall leave to-morrow--early [...] . . ." [...] he added more quietly.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{fault of}} your wanton ways," [...] he accused her harshly. [...] "You have so played {{fast and loose}} with this fellow Wilding that he makes free of your name in my very presence, and puts upon me the need <b>to</b> get <b>myself</b> <b>killed</b> by him <b>to</b> save the family honour." ...|$|R

2500|$|As the taped {{conversation}} continued, {{the jury}} heard Saldívar's {{reaction to the}} news of Selena's death after her phone picked up a local radio station's signal. In an angry voice, Saldívar asked Young why he had kept the singer's condition from her, since she wanted to visit Selena at the hospital, believing she was still alive. Young told Saldívar not to believe the radio announcement, {{and that he did}} not know about Selena's current condition. The conversation then switched to Saldívar blaming Quintanilla, Jr. for the murder claiming that he threatened to kill her. She explained to Young that she bought the gun for protection after finding her car tires deliberately slashed. She also told him how Quintanilla, Jr. sexually abused her by [...] "sticking a knife" [...] in her vagina, threatening to murder her if she went to the police. When asked about what happened in her motel room, Saldívar exclaimed: [...] "I bought this gun <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>myself,</b> not her, and she told me, 'Yolanda, I don't want you to kill yourself.' And we were talking about that when I took it out and pointed it to my head, and when I pointed it to my head, she opened the door. I said 'Selena, close that door,' and when I did that gun went off." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have said that}} the harassment associated with Gamergate springs from this existing well of deep-seated misogyny, and that it was merely brought to the fore by the anonymity of the Internet. Regarding the false allegations against Quinn, Amanda Marcotte in an article for The Daily Beast accused the video game world of being [...] "thick with misogynists who are aching to swarm" [...] with hate on any [...] "random woman held up for them to hate, no matter what the pretext". She related these attacks to harassment sent to a woman who criticized a Teen Titans cover and to a community manager of the Mighty No. 9 game because she drew a feminine Mega Man, and virtual rapes committed against women's player avatars in Grand Theft Auto V and DayZ. In an interview with the BBC, Quinn stated that [...] "Before [...] had a name, it was nothing but trying to get me <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>myself,</b> trying to get people to hurt me, going after my family. ... There is no mention of ethics in journalism at all outside of making the same accusation everybody makes towards any successful woman; that clearly she got to where she is because she had sex with someone." [...] Danielle Citron of the University of Maryland wrote that the intent of this type of harassment is to demean the victim, make them doubt their own integrity, and to redefine the victim's identity in order to [...] "fundamentally distort who she is".|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now,' I said to Otomie at my side, 'my hour has come, for the Spaniards {{will surely}} hang me, {{and it is}} in my mind, wife, that I should do well <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>myself,</b> so that I may be saved from a death of shame.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't {{think how}} hard I've struggled. When I found I loved her, I nearly <b>killed</b> <b>myself</b> trying <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> my love. But it's no good. It's {{stronger}} than I am." ...|$|R

5000|$|On October 28, Wilkins {{was arrested}} and charged with the murders of Freeman and Silva; he later also confessed to murdering Vallejo. He was sentenced to death on March 12, 2008, after only 90 minutes of {{deliberation}} by the jury. When asked by his defense lawyer if he wanted to die, Wilkins said: [...] "I guess, subconsciously, I've been trying <b>to</b> get <b>myself</b> <b>killed</b> since I was 12 or 13 years old. I don't have nothing to live for. I haven't been any good to anybody for the last 20 years and I won't be for the next 20 or the 20 after that." ...|$|R
6000|$|She stopped weeping, {{she made}} a great effort to control herself, {{and looked at me}} steadfastly for a moment. [...] "I was going to kill myself," [...] she whispered. [...] "I was going <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>myself</b> quietly--somehow. I meant to wait a bit and have an accident. I thought--you didn't understand. You were a man, and couldn't understand...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{he went on}} taunting {{us about}} old times, and {{especially}} reminding me that I had got him a thrashing, over breaking the school house window. When I went out to get them some more wine, for they wouldn't touch the spirits, I got a knife and hid it in my dress; for I {{made up my mind}} <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>myself,</b> rather than that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{he really}} dead?" [...] Maria said. [...] "Oh, Francisco, how thankful I am! He seemed so determined, that I {{began to think}} he was sure some day to succeed in {{carrying}} me off. Not that I would ever have become his wife, for I had vowed <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>myself</b> before that came about. I should have thought he might have known that he could never have forced me to be his wife." ...|$|E

Even if I had the means <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>myself,</b> {{it would be a}} sin; moreover, it might bring another to her death. Therefore, I await my doom, {{whatever}} it may be, with such patience as I can, trusting that my sufferings and ignominy may expiate my crimes in the sight of Him whom I renounced. But how come you here, Metem?" ...|$|E

I {{should have to}} live, to be sure, because I'd be afraid <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>myself,</b> but you would have done a {{thousand}} times worse than killing a body. You told me you had been always alone, you {{had never had a}} dog even. Well, then, I won't be in anybody's way if I live with you--not even a dog's.

But I intend to remain engaged to him. That's my purpose, and no man and no woman shall stir me from it." [...] He smiled, and again shook his head, and she began to doubt whether she did like him so much. [...] "Now I've told you all about myself," [...] she said, rising to her feet. [...] "You may believe me or not, as you please; but, as I have believed you, I have told you all." [...] Then she walked out of the room.|$|R
