The song climbs higher and higher, chorus by chorus, until Beyoncé reaches her apex, delivering some of her best vocals on the album. The lyrics are a bit uninspired, overly triumphant but somewhat humble as the singer contemplates her mark on history. Although she has garnered massive amounts of acclaim through her storied career, Beyoncé is far from satisfied." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wilson is infamously {{difficult}} to interview, rarely ever giving a long answer. According to Salon writer Peter Gilstrap: [...] "He’s also {{been known to}} get up, extend a hand and blurt out 'Thanks!' well before the allotted <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>up.</b> And sometimes he just gets tired and shuts down. None of this, however, {{is due to a}} bad attitude." [...] He admits to having a poor memory, and in interviews, occasionally lies to [...] "test" [...] people. David Oppenheim, who interviewed Wilson in 1966, remembers that [...] "we tried to talk with him but didn't get much out of him. Some guy said 'He's not verbal.' He was odd and he seemed odder." [...] In 2017, the Charlotte Observers Theodon Janes surmised that while Wilson's past struggles with mental illness are widely documented, he still [...] "is faring well enough to write a book ... and to headline [...] hugely ambitious concert tour, so presumably he’s capable of telling people who work for him that he's not up for interviews, if he isn't." [...] When asked about negative comments written in the book, Love responded: [...] "He’s not in charge of his life, like I am mine. His every move is orchestrated and a lot of things he's purported to say, there’s not tape of it. But, I don’t like to put undue pressure on him, either, because I know {{he has a lot of}} issues. Out of compassion, I don't respond to everything that is purportedly said by him." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of slow motion attacks in the game, called [...] "Concentration mode." [...] Ray and Thomas' concentrations modes are charged by killing enemies, with headshots charging their meters faster than body shots. However, once the player has filled their concentration meter, they have only sixty seconds in which to activate it, or it empties by half, and they must recharge it. In Ray's mode, once slow motion begins, Ray is free to rotate 360 degrees from a fixed position. If the crosshairs pass over an enemy, that enemy will be [...] "tagged". Up to twelve enemies in total can be tagged (or less than twelve enemies can be tagged multiple times, up {{to a total of}} twelve tags) during concentration mode, but the amount of time the player has to do so is limited (indicated by an on-screen meter). Once the <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>up,</b> Ray fires at all tagged enemies with perfect accuracy. In Thomas' concentration mode, the player does not need to manually aim. Instead, the crosshairs automatically moves from visible enemy to visible enemy, pausing on each one momentarily. As the crosshairs moves, the player must hold down a button permanently, and when the crosshairs pause, the player must pull back on the analog stick or move the mouse backwards to fire at the target (mimicking the action of real-life fanning). The third type of concentration mode is dual concentration, which happens automatically at certain points of the game, always at doorways. Ray and Thomas simultaneously burst into the room, and the game goes into slow motion. Two targeting reticles appear {{on either side of the}} screen, with each moving towards the center. The player cannot control the movement of either reticle, or move their character during concentration mode, but they can control the positioning of the screen, allowing them to maneuver the character's vision so as to position the reticles over an enemy. They can also shoot independently from either their left or right gun, or both simultaneously.|$|E
