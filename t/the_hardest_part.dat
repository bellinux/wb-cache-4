5|$|Stone {{wanted to}} {{recreate}} the Kennedy assassination in Dealey Plaza. His producers had to pay the Dallas City Council {{a substantial amount of}} money to hire police to reroute traffic and close streets for three weeks. He only had ten days to shoot all of the footage he needed and so he used seven cameras (two 35mm and five 16mm) and 14 film stocks. Getting permission to shoot in the Texas School Book Depository was more difficult. They had to pay $50,000 to put someone in the window from which Oswald was supposed to have shot Kennedy. They were allowed to film in that location only between certain hours with only five people on the floor at one time: the camera crew, an actor and Stone. Co-producer Clayton Townsend has said that <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> was getting the permission to restore the building to the way it looked back in 1963. It took five months of negotiation.|$|E
5|$|The film began full {{production}} in 2002. While most projects of its type took 18–24 months to complete, the development team completed {{the film in}} 13months. The project's budget was later estimated as being between $3.5 to $5million. In addition to Creative Capers, Taiwanese studio CGCG created most of the animation: at the time, overseas outsourcing was a rarity for CGI movies. By the end of production, the film ran to 77minutes of raw footage. At this stage, 310 Studios {{was brought in to}} handle post production, which mostly entailed cutting the film's length down by 7minutes. According to 310 Studios president Billy Jones, <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> of this was deciding which pieces needed to be cut, as they were impressed with everything that had been produced. 310 Studios also created the opening title and ending credit sequences. Lego also partnered with Miramax to distribute the film, along with developing a future full feature-length theatrical film.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} designer from Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2 is Tetsuya Nomura. Since {{art director}} Yusuke Naora convinced the Square staff to make Final Fantasy X an Asian-themed game, Nomura designed the characters {{to give them}} an Asian look. Nomura first illustrated the characters' faces and started adding details upon receiving information from the staff. Since the PlayStation 2's capabilities allowed to feature multiple details, Nomura did so with characters and asked the staff to make them consistent. <b>The</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> from his work involved making the characters's clothes identical between full motion scenes and in-game parts.|$|E

The meeting took place under the German Presidency of the EU, with Chancellor Angela Merkel leading the negotiations as President-in-Office of the European Council.

25|$|The {{process of}} cloning a {{particular}} farm animal using SCNT is relatively {{the same for}} all animals. The first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use. <b>The</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm. This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current. This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.|$|E
25|$|The {{onset of}} the {{southwest}} monsoon is anticipated to reach Punjab by May, but since the early 1970s the weather pattern has been irregular. The spring monsoon has either skipped over the area or has caused it to rain so hard that floods have resulted. June and July are oppressively hot. Although official estimates rarely place the temperature above 46°C, newspaper sources claim that it reaches 51°C and regularly carry reports about people who have succumbed to the heat. Heat records were broken in Multan in June 1993, when the mercury {{was reported to have}} risen to 54°C. In August the oppressive heat is punctuated by the rainy season, referred to as barsat, which brings relief in its wake. <b>The</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> of the summer is then over, but cooler weather does not come until late October.|$|E

25|$|After another league title, {{this time}} with Beitar Jerusalem in 1996-97, Zohar was sold to English club Crystal Palace for £1,200,000 but quickly {{returned}} to Israel after failing to make an impression at the club. In a league match against Southampton, Zohar stepped up to take a penalty kick in place of regular penalty kick taker, Bruce Dyer. His weakly hit shot cost Palace the win and so his reputation with the supporters was forever tainted. His dismal performances for Palace caused him to be voted by the fans {{as one of the}} top ten worst signings. In April 2012 Talk Sport magazine rated Zohar as Crystal Palace's Worst Foreign player. After returning from England, he was signed by Maccabi Haifa, as a replacement for Ukrainian midfielder Serhiy Kandaurov, who was sold to Portugal's Benfica. Haifa manager, Daniel Brailovsky was disappointed with Zohar's performances during practices and decided to let him languish on the bench during the season. After a falling out with Brailovsky, Zohar joined Maccabi Tel Aviv for his third stint but suffered an injury that saw him off the pitch for about 10 months. In retrospect, he later credited this injury to be <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> of his footballing career.|$|E
500|$|... "Fearful Symmetry" [...] {{takes its}} title from {{a line in}} the William Blake poem [...] "The Tyger". Filming for the episode faced several hurdles.

The biggest hurdle when filming scenes with the tiger were keeping it [...] "calm and warm", due to the cool nature of Vancouver. Due to anti-exploitation laws, several scenes had to be filmed in the country.|$|E

One example was a reference to Cheerio, a discontinued soft drink in Japan, for the English release the choice was made to use a discontinued American soft drink at the time, Crystal Pepsi. Director Kazuya Tsuramaki responded to criticism of FLCL, stating [...] "comprehension should not be an important factor in FLCL." ...|$|E

Finn claimed that <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> of filming the episode was getting an elephant; this action required a permit for the animal to pass the border into Vancouver. Finn later revealed that the elephant used for the episode, named [...] "Bubbles", was fantastic to work with. There was initially concern from the producers that the elephant would not run towards the truck for the episode's teaser. Instead, however, the elephant thoroughly enjoyed the truck and the producers had difficulty getting the creature away from it.|$|E
500|$|The stunt {{coordinator}} for the season was Tanner Gill. In September 2013, Ming-Na Wen talked about stunts and action scenes on the series, saying [...] "I have great stunt coordinators and choreographers to help me through every step and with the magic of filmmaking and editing, it all brings about her skills, to another level.

500|$|In {{addition}} to the original cartoon series, the developers gathered ideas from several sources for inspiration, including The Legend of Zelda action-adventure game series, and books such as T.

They noted that <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> of development was coming up with puzzles {{for each of the}} regions, as they had to be [...] "fun and challenging, but not repetitive". While they tried to maintain a balance between action and puzzles, they noted that they focused more on the puzzle aspect of the game.

[...] Martin has extensive experience in television writing, but it had been a decade since he had produced a teleplay.

Initially, there was a [...] "wholesome quality" [...] that bothered Carter, but as the episode was being filmed, both Carter and Millikan recognized that Allen was right for the part. In addition to the part of Maitreya, several stuntmen were needed for the episode, including doubles for Mulder and Maitreya for their martial art fight scene. Experienced gymnast Dana Heath was hired for several scenes that required Maitreya to execute a series of handstands. Fourteen stuntmen were needed to ride Kawasaki 600s and fire gas-powered machine-guns.|$|E
