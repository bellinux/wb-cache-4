5|$|All eight {{lines of}} the Oslo Commuter Rail have {{some or all of}} their {{services}} operate <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> although many of these terminate at Skøyen. The Airport Express Train operates four hourly services <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> and the Norwegian State Railways operate regional trains along the Vestfold Line and intercity trains along the Sørland Line and Bergen Line <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Freight trains along the Sørland Line operate <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> although only at night, while freight trains along the Bergen Line do not, instead using the Roa–Hønefoss Line.|$|E
5|$|As of December 2009, almost 276 million {{vehicles}} {{have passed}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> This figure includes {{a significant number}} of visitors to Colorado's ski resorts.|$|E
5|$|If the {{undamaged}} part {{were the}} rear {{half of the}} train, this would be driven by the Chef du Train, who is a fully authorised driver and occupies the rear driving cab while the train travels <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> for this purpose.|$|E

50|$|There {{was not yet}} a {{ventilation}} system and <b>the</b> traffic flow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> exceeded predicted numbers. During rush hour traffic, some motorists passed out from the fumes emitted from the exhaust of the congested vehicles. For the safety of motorists, the number of vehicles permitted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> was regulated until a {{ventilation system}} was installed.|$|R

5|$|During {{construction}} or winter storms that require closing Loveland Pass, {{there is a}} procedure in place to allow hazardous material trucks to use the tunnel. Once per hour, the tunnel bores will be closed to regular traffic, and the trucks will be guided <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> in a convoy with escorts.|$|E
5|$|The Oslo Tunnel is {{the most}} heavily trafficked section of {{mainline}} railway in Norway. It has a theoretical capacity of 40 trains per hour in each direction, and an applied capacity of 24 trains per hour in each direction. In rush hour, there are up to 20 trains operating <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> with a capacity of 8,000 passengers per hour.|$|E
5|$|The Zion–Mount Carmel Highway can be {{travelled}} year-round. Access for oversized vehicles {{requires a}} special permit, and {{is limited to}} daytime hours, as traffic <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> must be one way to accommodate large vehicles. The -long Kolob Canyons Road was built {{to provide access to}} the Kolob Canyons section of the park. This road often closes in the winter.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>tunnels</b> are {{no longer}} open to pedestrians, cyclists or other non-motorised traffic, and <b>the</b> {{northbound}} <b>tunnel</b> has a [...] height limit. The London Buses route 108 between Lewisham and Stratford runs <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels.</b>|$|R
25|$|As of 2017 {{eastbound}} and westbound travel <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> is tolled. There is a $5.25 toll for taxis, which {{passengers are}} responsible for.|$|R

5|$|A {{southbound}} {{passenger train}} and a pilot engine left Arthington station on 19 September 1854 heading for Leeds. A pilot engine had travelled northbound <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> earlier {{the same day}} with no problems {{but this time the}} train ran into a pile of stone debris and was derailed when it was three-quarters of the way into the tunnel. The debris was from a roof fall that affected both tracks. The train engine collided with the pilot engine tender causing considerable damage.|$|E

25|$|Much of <b>the</b> {{water flowing}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Moffat <b>Tunnel</b> to Denver {{actually}} crosses the Continental Divide three times. This water originates in the city's Williams Fork collection system, {{from which it}} passes east across <b>the</b> continental divide <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Gumlick <b>Tunnel</b> under Jones Pass, into the basin of Clear Creek. This water then flows north across <b>the</b> continental divide <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Vasquez <b>Tunnel</b> into <b>the</b> valley of the Fraser River before reaching <b>the</b> Moffat <b>Tunnel.</b>|$|R
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, it was {{anticipated}} that traffic <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> would rise on {{the completion of}} the M25 in 1986. At the time, the expectation was that other routes in London would be improved instead, diverting 15% of traffic away from the tunnel. In 1985, the Transport Minister, Lynda Chalker, announced that the number of toll booths would be increased to 12 each way, but concern grew that two tunnels {{would not be able to}} cope with the full demands of a completed M25.|$|E
5|$|Following its completion, Highway58 was rerouted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> west {{of which}} it forked. At the Pine Road interchange, one fork {{travelled}} north on Pine, east along Richmond Street and north along Ormond Street (now Niagara Regional Road52). The other fork followed the present route. As part {{of the creation of}} the Regional Municipality of Niagara, Highway8 was transferred to the newly formed region as well as the original alignment of Highway58.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the tunnel's shuttle trains carrying cars and lorries between Folkestone and Calais, the decision to build a railway tunnel opened up the possibility of through passenger and freight train services between places further afield. British Rail and SNCF contracted with Eurotunnel to use half the tunnel's capacity for this purpose. In 1987 Britain, France and Belgium set up an International Project Group to specify a train to provide an international high-speed passenger service <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> France had been operating high-speed TGV services since 1981, and had begun {{construction of a new}} high-speed line between Paris and the Channel Tunnel, LGV Nord; French TGV technology was chosen {{as the basis for the}} new trains. An order for 30 trainsets, to be manufactured in France but with some British and Belgian components, was placed in December 1989. On 20 June 1993, the first Eurostar test train travelled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> to the UK. Various technical difficulties in running the new trains on British tracks were quickly overcome.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 14 June 2010, some S 2 {{services}} {{ran from}} Offenbach Ost to Offenbach Hauptbahnhof {{because of lack}} of capacity in <b>the</b> Frankfurt S-Bahn <b>tunnels.</b> These now all run <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels.</b>|$|R

5|$|Now {{an escape}} seemed like Berkman's only option. The {{plan was to}} rent a {{house across the street}} from the prison and dig an {{underground}} tunnel from the house to the prison. Berkman had been given access to a large portion of the prison and had grown familiar with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar of the house to the stable inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into the stable, tear open the wooden flooring, and crawl <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> to the house.|$|E
5|$|The {{transport}} of hazardous goods through the crossing {{is governed by}} the European ADR Agreement. The Dartford Crossing is class C, which restricts transporting goods such as nitrates and flammable liquids. The introduction of the ADR scheme initially caused confusion, and for a short time, transporting aerosols <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> was banned. Certain hazardous goods vehicles, together with some oversize and abnormal loads (if permitted) may require escorting by Highways Agency Traffic Officers. The crossing authority must hold exercises {{in conjunction with the}} emergency services. In 2006 Exercise Orpheus was held, involving the closure of both road tunnels for five hours.|$|E
5|$|In an epilogue, Charlie is {{discovered}} {{by his parents}} in a catatonic state and does not show any movement despite being hit reluctantly by his father. After being admitted to a mental hospital, it is revealed that Helen actually sexually abused {{him when he was}} young, and his love for her (and empathy for her troubled youth) caused him to repress his traumatic memories. This psychological damage explains his flashbacks and derealization phases throughout the book. In two months Charlie is released, and Sam and Patrick visit him. In the epilogue, Sam, Patrick and Charlie go <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> again and Charlie stands up and exclaims that he felt infinite.|$|E
