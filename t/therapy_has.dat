5|$|The female hormone estrogen, {{when used}} in the {{combined}} oral contraceptive pill and in perimenopausal hormone replacement <b>therapy,</b> <b>has</b> been associated with a two- to sixfold increased risk of venous thrombosis. The risk depends {{on the type of}} hormones used, the dose of estrogen, and the presence of other thrombophilic risk factors. Various mechanisms, such as deficiency of protein S and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, are said to be responsible.|$|E
5|$|Antidiabetic <b>therapy</b> <b>has</b> been {{proposed}} {{as a treatment}} for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance, since the late 1980s. The use of metformin in PCOS was first reported in 1994, in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. However, two clinical studies completed in 2006–2007 returned mostly negative results, with metformin performing no better than placebo, and a metformin-clomifene combination no better than clomifene alone. Reflecting this, subsequent reviews large randomized controlled trials in general have not shown the promise suggested by the early studies. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from the drug treatment.|$|E

A short time following his brother's death, Nicholas relocated {{to the family}} seat at Wimborne St Giles, returned to business school {{for a couple of}} years, and assumed the responsibilities of the earldom. He has shown an interest in supporting charitable organisations, primarily those addressing the needs of children with disabilities. In December 2009, Nicholas suffered serious spinal injuries in a horse riding accident. He crushed his vertebrae in the fall.

5|$|With current treatments, {{patients}} with low and intermediate risk disease {{have an excellent}} prognosis with cure rates above 90% for low risk and 70–90% for intermediate risk. In contrast, therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma {{the past two decades}} resulted in cures only about 30% of the time. The addition of antibody <b>therapy</b> <b>has</b> raised survival rates for high-risk disease significantly. In March 2009 an early analysis of a Children's Oncology Group (COG) study with 226 high-risk patients showed that two years after stem cell transplant 66% of the group randomized to receive ch14.18 antibody with GM-CSF and IL-2 were alive and disease-free compared to only 46% in the group that did not receive the antibody. The randomization was stopped so all patients enrolling on the trial will receive the antibody therapy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Over {{the past}} decade, {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) {{has become a}} treatable neurological disease. This paper reviews the <b>therapies</b> that <b>have</b> been studied to treat MS and discusses various treatment approaches on the horizon. Immunosuppres-sive and immunomodulatory <b>therapies</b> <b>have</b> been shown to alter the long-term course of MS. Therapies are currently avail-able for relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, and pro-gressive relapsing disease. Although effective, these <b>therapies</b> <b>have</b> a modest impact on reduction in relapse rate and slowing of disease progression. Much work is needed to improve upon this modest effect and hopefully obtain a cure. Key words: disease-modifying agents, immunomodulatory, immunosuppressive, immunotherapy, multiple sclerosis, treatment...|$|R

The applications of gene <b>therapy</b> <b>have</b> now become wider, however, and include cardiovascular diseases, vaccination and cancers in which conventional <b>therapies</b> <b>have</b> failed. With regard to oncology, various gene <b>therapy</b> approaches <b>have</b> been developed. Among them, the use of genetic toxins to kill cancer cells selectively is emerging. Two different types of genetic toxins have been developed so far: the metabolic toxins and the dominant-negative class of toxins. This review describes these two different approaches, and discusses their potential applications in cancer gene therapy...|$|R
