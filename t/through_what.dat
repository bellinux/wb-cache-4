5|$|After an {{inconclusive}} skirmish in late June at Kellogg's Grove, Black Hawk and {{his band}} fled the approaching militia through Wisconsin. They had passed <b>through</b> <b>what</b> are now Beloit and Janesville, then followed the Rock River toward Horicon Marsh, where they headed west toward the Four Lakes region (near modern-day Madison). The band camped for the night near Pheasant Branch.|$|E
5|$|By 2:00 AM {{the entire}} army was in motion roughly along Quaker Bridge Road <b>through</b> <b>what</b> is now Hamilton Township. The men {{were ordered to}} march with {{absolute}} silence. Along the way, a rumor was spread that they were surrounded and some frightened militiamen fled for Philadelphia. The march was difficult, {{as some of the}} route ran through thick woods and it was icy, causing horses to slip, and men to break through ice on ponds.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{proximity}} of the Roman road, entrenchments and relics it seems that the earliest settlement at Northallerton was some form of Roman military station. There is evidence that the Romans had a signal station on Castle Hills just {{to the west of the}} town as part of the imperial Roman postal system and a path connecting Hadrian's Wall with Eboracum (York) ran <b>through</b> <b>what</b> is now the neighbouring village of Brompton.|$|E

5|$|Explorer James Clark Ross passed <b>through</b> <b>what</b> is {{now known}} as the Ross Sea and {{discovered}} Ross Island (both of which were named after him) in 1841. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the Ross Ice Shelf. Mount Erebus and Mount Terror are named after two ships from his expedition: HMS Erebus and Terror. Mercator Cooper landed in East Antarctica on 26 January 1853.|$|E
5|$|Gary Steinman of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine {{said that}} the lack of a plotline gave the player no {{incentive}} to keep playing <b>through</b> <b>what</b> he felt was a poor combat system. Both of those criticisms were repeated by Electronic Gaming Monthlys Sam Kennedy in his review. RPGamer's Bilyk felt that the smaller plots, while sometimes simplistic and not focused on the player, were enjoyable experiences. IGN's Smith concluded that while he enjoyed the game, he felt {{that it was not a}} complete game like Secret of Mana, but instead a collection of fun experiences.|$|E

5|$|In 1701, {{the first}} {{transportation}} routes <b>through</b> <b>what</b> became {{the state of}} Michigan were the lakes, rivers and Indian trails. Two of these trails followed parts of the future US2. The Sault–Green Bay Trail roughly followed the Lake Michigan shoreline routing of US2 between Escanaba and St. Ignace. The Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace with Sault Ste. Marie.|$|E

She met her second husband, professional wrestler and former boxer Marc Mero, in 1993. She had breast implants that same year. After marrying Mero in 1994, she broke into the wrestling business <b>through</b> <b>what</b> was then known as the World Wrestling Federation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{overland}} transportation corridors {{in the future}} state of Michigan were the Indian trails. Two of these trails are relevant to US12. The St. Joseph Trail ran between the Benton Harbor–St. Joseph area and Detroit by way {{of what is now}} Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Jackson and Ann Arbor. The second, the Sauk Trail, ran further south <b>through</b> <b>what</b> is now Niles, and Coldwater to the Ann Arbor area.|$|E

5|$|Egypt {{invaded the}} newly {{declared}} State of Israel on May 15, 1948. Their strength was approximately one division, commanded by Major General Ahmed Ali al-Mwawi. Their advance was three-pronged: The main column moved north <b>through</b> <b>what</b> is today the Gaza Strip and attacked Kfar Darom, another column went east toward Beersheba, {{and a third}} attacked kibbutz Nirim. On May 17, a small force split off from Beersheba to link up with more Egyptian forces at Auja al-Hafir, on May 19 the main column attacked Yad Mordechai, and on May 20, the main force in Beersheba set out to link with the Jordanian Arab Legion in Hebron.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{the absence of}} an active high yield market {{prompted}} KKR to change its tactics, avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations <b>through</b> <b>what</b> were described as leveraged buildups or rollups. One of KKR's largest investments in the 1990s was the leveraged buildup of Primedia in partnership with former executives of Macmillan Publishing, which KKR had failed to acquire in 1988. KKR created Primedia's predecessor, K-III Communications, a platform to buy media properties, initially completing the $310 million divisional buyout of the book club division of Macmillan along with the assets of Intertec Publishing Corporation in May 1989.|$|E
5|$|The Etoiles {{are elected}} after going <b>through</b> <b>what</b> {{is known as}} , which {{consists}} of three competitions in the light novels and the manga versions. The higher scoring pairs from the first two competitions carry on to the third competition, and the pair that wins the third competition becomes the Etoile Couple. In the anime, the competition aspect {{of the story is}} toned down. Still, it facilitates the culmination of the story in the finale, and thus serves an important purpose. Once the winners have been named, a special ceremony marks the end of the election, at which the president of the student council from the school that won the election presents two necklaces for the winners to wear during their tenure as Etoiles. They are both identical except for the colors of the pendants: one is red, the other is blue. The older student receives the blue pendant and the younger of the two is given the red pendant.|$|E

5|$|The John Day basin {{remained}} largely unexplored by non-natives until the mid-19thcentury. Lewis and Clark noted {{but did not}} explore the John Day River while traveling along the Columbia River in 1805. John Day, for whom the river is named, apparently visited only its confluence with the Columbia in 1812. In 1829, Peter Skene Ogden, working for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), led a company of explorers and fur trappers along the river <b>through</b> <b>what</b> would later become the Sheep Rock Unit. John Work, also of the HBC, visited {{this part of the}} river in 1831.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{after an}} {{inconclusive}} skirmish at Kellogg's Grove, Black Hawk {{and his band}} fled the approaching militia through modern-day Wisconsin. The Sinsinawa Mound raid occurred on 29 June, {{five days after the}} Battle of Apple River Fort. As the band fled the pursuing militia, they passed <b>through</b> <b>what</b> are now Beloit and Janesville, then followed the Rock River toward Horicon Marsh, where they headed west toward the Four Lakes region, near modern-day Madison. On 21 July 1832, the militia caught up with Black Hawk's band as they attempted to cross the Wisconsin River, near the present-day Town of Roxbury, in Dane County, Wisconsin, resulting in the Battle of Wisconsin Heights.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} modern NY311 from NY292 in West Patterson and NY22 in Patterson was {{designated}} in the mid-1920s {{as part of}} NY39, an east–west route extending from Poughkeepsie to Patterson via East Fishkill and West Pawling. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the segment of NY39 east of West Patterson was renumbered to NY311 while the portion of 1920s NY39 from East Fishkill to West Patterson became part of NY52. NY52 also continued south from West Patterson <b>through</b> <b>what</b> is now Lake Carmel to Carmel, where it continued east on an overlap with U.S. Route6 (US6).|$|E

5|$|The {{stranding}} of the Northern bottlenose whale mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of Suðuroy: Hvalba and Sandvík. It is believed that it happens because of a navigation problem of the whale, because there are isthmuses on these places, where the distance between the east and west coasts are short, around one kilometer or so. And for some reason it seems like the bottlenose whale want to take a short cut <b>through</b> <b>what</b> it thinks is a sound, and too late it discovers, that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn around again. It happened on 30 August 2012, when two Northern bottlenose whales swam ashore to the gorge Sigmundsgjógv in Sandvík. Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales, and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals and then cut up for food for the people of Sandvík and Hvalba (Hvalba municipality).|$|E
5|$|United States Navy SEALs have {{distinguished}} {{themselves as}} an individually reliable, collectively disciplined and highly skilled special operations force. The most important trait that distinguishes Navy SEALs {{from all other}} military forces is that SEALs are maritime special operations, as they strike from {{and return to the}} sea. SEALs (SEa, Air, Land) take their name from the elements in and from which they operate. SEALs are experts in direct action and special reconnaissance missions. Their stealth and clandestine methods of operation allow them to conduct multiple missions against targets that larger forces cannot approach undetected. Because of the dangers inherent in their missions, prospective SEALs go <b>through</b> <b>what</b> is considered by many military experts to be the toughest training regime in the world.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work <b>through</b> <b>what</b> they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
