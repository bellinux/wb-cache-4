5|$|Proxy records {{based on}} paleotempestological {{research}} {{have revealed that}} major hurricane activity along the Gulf of Mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia. Few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000–1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium. These quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD, when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3–5 times. This millennial-scale variability has been attributed <b>to</b> <b>long-term</b> shifts {{in the position of}} the Azores High, which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation.|$|E

5|$|The Solar System is chaotic over million- and billion-year timescales, {{with the}} orbits of the planets open <b>to</b> <b>long-term</b> variations. One notable example of this chaos is the Neptune–Pluto system, which lies in a 3:2 orbital {{resonance}}. Although the resonance itself will remain stable, it becomes impossible to predict the position of Pluto {{with any degree of}} accuracy more than 10–20million years (the Lyapunov time) into the future. Another example is Earth's axial tilt, which, due to friction raised within Earth's mantle by tidal interactions with the Moon (see below), will be incomputable at some point between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} contains {{high levels}} of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>long-term</b> stress than most other brain areas. There is evidence that humans having experienced severe, long-lasting traumatic stress show atrophy of the hippocampus more than of {{other parts of the}} brain. These effects show up in post-traumatic stress disorder, and they may contribute to the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and severe depression. A recent study has also revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{conditions}} associated with thrombophilia are {{deep vein thrombosis}} (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which are referred to collectively as venous thromboembolism (VTE). DVT usually occurs in the legs, and is characterized by pain, swelling and redness of the limb. It may lead <b>to</b> <b>long-term</b> swelling and heaviness due to damage to valves in the veins. The clot may also break off and migrate (embolize) to arteries in the lungs. Depending on the size {{and the location of}} the clot, this may lead to sudden-onset shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations and may be complicated by collapse, shock and cardiac arrest.|$|E

5|$|The {{three main}} forms of {{deterioration}} in historical silver artifacts are tarnishing, formation of silver chloride due <b>to</b> <b>long-term</b> immersion in salt water, {{as well as}} reaction with nitrate ions or oxygen. Fresh silver chloride is pale yellow, becoming purplish on exposure to light; it projects slightly {{from the surface of}} the artifact or coin. The precipitation of copper in ancient silver can be used to date artifacts, as copper is nearly always a constituent of silver alloys.|$|E

5|$|After Banner, Briskin {{returned}} to work at Columbia Pictures, where he began producing for them in 1926, and in 1928 he was given control over 18 of their productions. By 1929, Briskin had risen to be a top executive at the studio, sharing honors with studio head Harry Cohn, in giving the closing address at Columbia's annual sales meeting in July 1929. By the end of 1929, Briskin was the assistant general manager of Columbia, and {{on a visit to}} New York City signed several Broadway playwrights <b>to</b> <b>long-term</b> contracts with the studio, including Elmer Harris, Jo Swerling, and Paul Hervey Fox. Not only was Briskin active in the production office at Columbia, but he also played on Columbia's baseball team, which competed in the Motion Picture Baseball League. It was while working at Columbia that Briskin met Frank Capra. In 1930, Briskin's brother Irving, who he had employed while at Banner, joined him as a producer at Columbia.|$|E
5|$|As a {{commercial}} entity, Messi's marketing brand {{has been based}} exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Cristiano Ronaldo and David Beckham. At {{the start of his}} career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami. From 2010 onwards, concurrently with his increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading <b>to</b> <b>long-term</b> endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet. Messi is also a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies. Additionally, Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010 and PES 2011. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and has since appeared on four consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the NFL {{established}} the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee (MTBI), which was later {{replaced by the}} Head, Neck and Spine Committee, to study concussions and brain injuries in professional football players. The committee and its leadership, including Ira Casson and Elliot Pellman, were criticized by former players for stating {{that there is not}} enough research to determine if concussions lead to permanent brain injury. Pellman, who served as chairman of the committee from 1994 to 2007, received a large amount of criticism because {{he did not have a}} background in neurology and the research he published on brain injuries disagreed with the findings of independent scientists. In 2009, a NFL-commissioned report showed increased incidence of diagnosis of memory loss and dementia among retired professional football players when compared to the general population. The study also indicated that these symptoms were related to the effects of concussions. However, the NFL and the report's own researchers questioned the reliability of some of the data-gathering methods employed by the study, including the fact that the study was conducted by phone. The same year, the committee acknowledged for the first time that concussions can lead <b>to</b> <b>long-term</b> brain injuries. A Congressional hearing in October 2009, as well as pressure from the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), led to an overhaul of the concussion policy in November and December of that year.|$|E
