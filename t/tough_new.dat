5|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the civil}} war in 1970, some ethnic {{violence}} has persisted. There has subsequently been a period of relative harmony since the Federal Government introduced <b>tough</b> <b>new</b> measures against religious violence in all affected parts of the country. The 2002 Miss World pageant was moved from Abuja to London in the wake of violent protests in the Northern part of the country that left more than 100people dead and over 500 injured. The rioting erupted after Muslims in the country reacted in anger to comments made by a newspaper reporter. Rioters in Kaduna killed an estimated 105 men, women, and children with a further 521 injured taken to hospital.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, a {{draft report}} of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{laid the groundwork for}} <b>tough</b> <b>new</b> {{standards}} to limit public exposure to trichloroethylene. The assessment set off a fight between the EPA and the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Energy, and NASA, who appealed directly to the White House. They argued that the EPA had produced junk science, its assumptions were badly flawed, and that evidence exonerating the chemical was ignored.|$|E

5000|$|Critics {{charge that}} Thai {{governmental}} efforts to end trafficking are a charade that works like this: every March the Thai government talks <b>tough</b> and announces <b>new</b> plans and laws to end trafficking. This {{is timed to}} coincide with the writing of the US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP), issued every June. In 2015, the Thai government once again passed a <b>tougher</b> <b>new</b> trafficking law. The new law authorises the death penalty and fines of up to 400,000 baht for human traffickers if their [...] "customers" [...] die. Some observers believe that the continued trafficking exists only because of official corruption, a state of affairs that tougher laws do nothing to remedy.|$|R
25|$|In Grant's {{two terms}} he {{strengthened}} Washington's legal capabilities to directly intervene to protect citizenship rights {{even if the}} states ignored the problem. He worked with Congress to create the Department of Justice and Office of Solicitor General, led by Attorney General Amos Akerman and the first Solicitor General Benjamin Bristow. Congress passed three powerful Enforcement Acts in 1870–71. These were criminal codes which protected the Freedmen's right to vote, to hold office, to serve on juries, and receive equal protection of laws. Most important, they authorized {{the federal government to}} intervene when states did not act. Grant's new Justice Department prosecuted thousands of Klansmen under the <b>tough</b> <b>new</b> laws. Grant sent federal troops to nine South Carolina counties to suppress Klan violence in 1871. Grant supported passage of the Fifteenth Amendment stating that no state could deny a man the right to vote on the basis of race. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 giving people access to public facilities regardless of race.|$|E

Despite <b>tougher</b> <b>new</b> emission measures announced by the federal government in June 2010, industry officials believe the province will continue using coal to generate electricity into 2050. Syncrude's Mildred Lake and Aurora North Plant Sites, the coal fired Sundance Power Station and the coal fired Genesee Generating Station are the top three sources of greenhouse gases in Canada.|$|R

The policy, introduced by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, implements a <b>tougher,</b> <b>new</b> personal-conduct policy, and under conditions of the previous policy handed down two of the harshest suspensions in NFL history for off-field misdeeds. Each player that has been suspended must reapply for reinstatement. The policy only applies to the player's personal lives and image in the public spotlight.

40|$|Understanding, {{predicting}} {{and eventually}} improving {{the resistance to}} fracture for silicate materials is of primary importance to design <b>tougher</b> <b>new</b> glasses suitable for advanced applications. However, the fracture mechanism at the atomic level in amorphous silicate materials is still a topic of debate. In particular, there are some controversies {{about the existence of}} ductility at the nanoscale during crack propagation. Here, we present simulations of fracture of three archetypical silicate glasses, using molecular dynamics. The simulations clearly show that, depending on their composition, silicate glasses can exhibit different degrees of ductility at the nanoscale. Additionally, we show that the methodology used in the present work can provide realistic predictions of fracture energy and toughness...|$|R
