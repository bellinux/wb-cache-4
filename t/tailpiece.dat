25|$|In 1953, the trapeze <b>tailpiece</b> was dropped, {{and a new}} stopbar {{design was}} added. This design {{combined}} a pre-intonated bridge and <b>tailpiece</b> with two studs just behind the bridge pickup. This increased the sustain of the Goldtop noticeably; however, the intonation and string height adjustability were limited. A new design, the Tune-o-matic, replaced the stopbar in 1955. It consisted of a separate bridge and <b>tailpiece</b> attached directly {{to the top of}} the guitar, combining an easily adjustable bridge with a sustain-carrying <b>tailpiece.</b> This design has been used on most Les Pauls ever since. The tuners were produced by Kluson.|$|E

25|$|In late 1972, Garcia {{purchased}} the first guitar (Eagle) made by Alembic luthier Doug Irwin for $850 (~$4,948 in 2017). Enamored of Irwin's talents, he immediately commissioned his own custom instrument. This guitar, nicknamed Wolf for a memorable sticker Garcia added below the <b>tailpiece,</b> was delivered in May 1973 and replaced Alligator {{on stage in}} September. It cost $1,500 (~$8,191 in 2017), an extremely high price for the era.|$|E
25|$|Other American-made {{variants}} {{include the}} mandolinetto or Howe-Orme guitar-shaped mandolin (manufactured by the Elias Howe Company between 1897 and roughly 1920), which featured a cylindrical bulge {{along the top}} from fingerboard end to <b>tailpiece</b> and the Vega mando-lute (more commonly called a cylinder-back mandolin manufactured by the Vega Company between 1913 and roughly 1927), which had a similar longitudinal bulge but on the back rather than {{the front of the}} instrument.|$|E
50|$|The guitar {{has been}} {{produced}} {{both as a}} single-pickup instrument (ES-330T) and as a dual-pickup instrument (ES-330TD). Somewhat unusually, the ES-330T had its pickup mounted halfway between the bridge {{and the end of}} the neck, not in one of the usual neck or bridge positions. It has been available in sunburst, cherry, natural, walnut, and sparkling burgundy finishes. <b>Tailpieces</b> used are usually trapeze or Bigsby vibrato <b>tailpieces.</b> Due to its lack of popularity compared to the other Gibson thinline guitars (such as the ES-335, ES-345, and ES-355), the ES-330 was discontinued by Gibson in 1972. Since then, it has been reissued a few times by the Gibson Custom Shop division.|$|R

25|$|Strings run between {{mechanical}} tuning machines {{at the top}} of the neck to a <b>tailpiece</b> that anchors the other end of the strings. The strings are suspended over the neck and soundboard and pass over a floating bridge. The bridge is kept in contact with the soundboard by the downward pressure from the strings. The neck is either flat or has a slight radius, and is covered with a fingerboard with frets. The action of the strings on the bridge causes the soundboard to vibrate, producing sound.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tailpiece</b> anchors {{the strings}} {{to the lower}} bout of the violin {{by means of the}} tailgut, which loops around an ebony button called the tailpin (sometimes confusingly called the endpin, like the cello's spike), which fits into a tapered hole in the bottom block. Very often the E string will have a fine tuning lever worked by a small screw turned by the fingers. Fine tuners may also be applied to the other strings, {{especially}} on a student instrument, and are sometimes built into the <b>tailpiece.</b> The fine tuners enable the performer to make small changes in the pitch of a string. At the scroll end, the strings wind around the wooden tuning pegs in the pegbox. The tuning pegs are tapered and fit into holes in the peg box. The tuning pegs are held in place by the friction of wood on wood. Strings may be made of metal or less commonly gut or gut wrapped in metal. Strings usually have a colored silk wrapping at both ends, for identification of the string (e.g., G string, D string, A string or E string) and to provide friction against the pegs. The tapered pegs allow friction to be increased or decreased by the player applying appropriate pressure along the axis of the peg while turning it.|$|E
25|$|On {{graduating from}} the Academy of Music in Krak√≥w in 1958, Penderecki took up a {{teaching}} post at the Academy. His early works show the influence of Anton Webern and Pierre Boulez (Penderecki has also been influenced by Igor Stravinsky). Penderecki's international recognition began in 1959 at the Warsaw Autumn with the premieres of the works Strophen, Psalms of David, and Emanations, but the piece that truly brought him to international attention was Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (see threnody and atomic bombing of Hiroshima), written in 1960 for 52 string instruments. In it, he makes use of extended instrumental techniques (for example, playing behind the bridge, bowing on the <b>tailpiece).</b> There are many novel textures in the work, which makes great use of tone clusters. He originally titled the work 8' 37", but decided to dedicate it {{to the victims of}} Hiroshima.|$|E
50|$|The codex {{contains}} a complete {{text of the}} Gospels on 297 parchment leaves (14.8 cm by 11.7 cm). The text is written in one column per page, 19 lines per page in minuscule letters. The initial letters are in gold. Simple headpieces and <b>tailpieces</b> are in gold.|$|R
50|$|Modern uses {{are largely}} {{restricted}} to small items, such as crucifixes, and musical instrument parts, including black piano and harpsichord keys, violin, viola, mandolin, guitar, double bass, and cello fingerboards, <b>tailpieces,</b> pegs, chinrests, and bow frogs.

25|$|Violins are tuned {{by turning}} the pegs in the pegbox under the scroll, or by {{adjusting}} the fine tuner screws at the <b>tailpiece.</b> All violins have pegs; fine tuners (also called fine adjusters) are optional. Most fine tuners consist of a metal screw that moves a lever attached to the string end. They permit very small pitch adjustments much more easily than the pegs. By turning one clockwise, the pitch becomes sharper (as the string is under more tension) and turning one counterclockwise, the pitch becomes flatter (as the string is under less tension). Fine tuners on {{all four of the}} strings are a practical necessity for playing steel-core strings, and some players use them with synthetic strings as well. Since modern E strings are steel, a fine tuner is typically fitted for that string. Fine tuners are not used with gut strings, which are more elastic than steel or synthetic-core strings and do not respond adequately to the very small movements of fine tuners.|$|E
25|$|Baroque era cellos {{differed}} from the modern instrument in several ways. The neck has a different form and angle, which matches the baroque bass-bar and stringing. Modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument (and transmit some of the sound through the floor), while Baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player. Modern bows curve in and are held at the frog; Baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow's point of balance. Modern strings normally have a metal core, although some use a synthetic core; Baroque strings are made of gut, with the G and C strings wire-wound. Modern cellos often have fine-tuners connecting the strings to the <b>tailpiece,</b> which make {{it much easier to}} tune the instrument, but such pins are rendered ineffective by the flexibility of the gut strings used on Baroque cellos. Overall, the modern instrument has much higher string tension than the Baroque cello, resulting in a louder, more projecting tone, with fewer overtones.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>tailpiece</b> and endpin {{are found}} in {{the lower part of the}} cello. The <b>tailpiece</b> is the part of the cello to which the [...] "ball ends" [...] of the strings are {{attached}} by passing them through holes. The <b>tailpiece</b> is attached to the bottom of the cello. The <b>tailpiece</b> is traditionally made of ebony or another hard wood, but can also be made of plastic or steel on lower-cost instruments. It attaches the strings to the lower end of the cello, and can have one or more fine tuners. The fine tuners are used to make smaller adjustments to the pitch of the string. The fine tuners can increase the tension of each string (raising the pitch) or decrease the tension of the string (lowering the pitch). When the performer is putting on a new string, the fine tuner for that string is normally reset to a middle position, and then the peg is turned to bring the string up to pitch. The fine turners are used for subtle, minor adjustments to pitch, such as tuning a cello to the oboe's 440 Hz A note or to tune the cello to a piano.|$|E
