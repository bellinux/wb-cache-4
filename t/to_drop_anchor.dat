Three days later, in Norwegian waters, Lütjens ordered a fuel stop in a Grimstadfjord near Bergen. He did not inform either Lindemann or Brinkmann about the decision <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>anchor</b> and refuel. As was his custom, he offered no explanation for changing his mind.|$|E
25|$|In fact, after three-and-a-half {{months of}} repairs, the Cruzeiro do Canal {{returned}} to active service in Christmas 2010, after several tests and certification of navegability from IPTM. Until that time, Cruzeiro das Ilhas continued the half-hour trip between Madalena and Horta. In 2009, the ferry lost power to its motors on {{arrival in the}} port of Horta, requiring the master <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>anchor.</b> Yet, following problems with initial tenders, and specifically with the long-haul Atlântida ferry, the older Cruzeiros were not replaced immediately.|$|E
25|$|At île de Lot, Aréthuse had, upon departure, maneuvered {{to catch}} the wind and struck the bottom, {{breaking}} her rudder and forcing the squadron <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>anchor</b> on the spot. That very night, a violent storm broke out, and both frigates broke their cables. Aréthuse managed to avoid running aground using a makeshift rudder, {{and in the morning}} found herself drifted twelve miles to the North-West of Tamara; Bouvet dropped anchor as soon as he found the bottom to repair his rudder. Meanwhile, Rubis had been cast aground on the shore of Tamara. At ten, she fired distress shots and signals; Aréthuse launched her longboat to assist, but could not maneuver herself without her rudder; the launch carried two additional pumps to Rubis, but returned with the news that she was unsalvageable and that her crew was transferring on Serra The following night, the hull of the stranded Rubis broke under the stress of the waves. Commander Ollivier scuttled her by fire and embarked his crew on Serra.|$|E

25|$|After {{the attacks}} {{carried out by}} Scirè, the {{commander}} of the Decima MAS realised that, given the limitations of using a submarine as a mother ship for human torpedoes in Gibraltar, it would be more feasible to mount a secret base in neutral Spain. A first step in that direction was taken when a member of the Decima, Antonio Ramognino, rented a bungalow along the coast road near Algeciras, right in front of a bay used by Allied convoys <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>anchors.</b> The operations from Villa Carmela were carried out by combat swimmers. Because Ramognino's wife was a Spanish citizen, he had little difficulty establishing his ‘home’ there.|$|R
25|$|While {{returning}} to Spain, the Niña and Pinta encountered the roughest storm of their journey, and, {{on the night}} of 13 February, lost contact with each other. All hands on the Niña vowed, if they were spared, to make a pilgrimage to the nearest church of Our Lady wherever they first made land. On the morning of February 15, land was spotted. Columbus believed they were approaching the Azore Islands, but other members of the crew felt that they were considerably north of the islands. Columbus turned out to be right. On the night of February 17, the Niña laid anchor at Santa Maria Island, but the cable broke on sharp rocks, forcing Columbus to stay offshore until the morning, when a safer location was found <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>anchor</b> nearby. A few sailors took a boat to the island, where they were told by several islanders of a still safer place to land, so the Niña moved once again. At this spot, Columbus took on board several islanders who had gathered onshore with food, and told them that his crew wished to come ashore to fulfill their vow. The islanders told him that a small shrine dedicated to Our Lady was nearby. Columbus sent half of the crew members to the island to fulfill their vow, but he {{and the rest of the}} crew stayed on the Niña, planning to send the other half to the island upon the return of the first crew members. While the first crew members were saying their prayers at the shrine, they were taken prisoner by the islanders, under orders from the island's captain, João de Castanheira, ostensibly out of fear that the men were pirates. The boat that the crew members had taken to the island was then commandeered by Castanheira, which he took with several armed men to the Niña, in an attempt to arrest Columbus. During a verbal battle across the bows of both craft, during which Columbus did not grant permission for him to come aboard, Castanheira announced that he did not believe or care who Columbus said that he was, especially if he was indeed from Spain. Castanheira returned to the island. However, after another two days, Castanheira released the prisoners, having been unable to get confessions from them, and having been unable to capture his real target, Columbus. There are later claims that Columbus was also captured, but this is not backed up by Columbus's log book.|$|E
500|$|The {{first major}} naval {{action in the}} North Sea, the Battle of Helgoland Bight, took place on 28 August 1914. Helgoland was again {{stationed}} off Wangerooge. Despite her proximity to the battle, Helgoland was not sent to aid the beleaguered German cruisers, as {{she could not be}} risked in an unsupported attack against possibly superior British forces. Instead, the ship was ordered <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>anchor</b> and await relief by [...] By 04:30, Helgoland received the order to join [...] and sail out of the harbor. At 05:00, the two battleships met the battered cruisers [...] and [...] By 07:30, the ships had returned to port for the night. Three days later, on 31 August, Helgoland was put into drydock for maintenance. On the afternoon of 7 September, Helgoland {{and the rest of the}} High Seas Fleet conducted a training cruise to the main island of Heligoland.|$|E
500|$|The {{invasion}} of Norway {{took place in}} early April 1940. Königsberg was assigned to Gruppe 3, and was tasked with transporting 600 troops from the Wehrmacht's 69th Infantry Division from Wilhelmshaven to Bergen, Norway. Gruppe 3 also included her sister ship , the artillery training ship , and the torpedo boats Wolf and Leopard. The Germans left Wilhelmshaven on 8 April, and had reached their target the following day, where Königsberg transferred part of the landing party to several smaller vessels. She then made a high-speed run into the port {{in an attempt to}} land the remainder of the infantry in the town directly. A [...] coastal battery at the Kvarven Fort took the ship under fire, and scored three hits, all forward. The hits caused severe flooding and fires in her boiler rooms that cut the ship's power. Adrift, and unable to maneuver, Königsberg had <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>anchor,</b> while she and Köln, Luftwaffe bombers, and the infantry neutralized the Norwegian guns.|$|E
6000|$|I {{ordered him}} <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> the <b>anchor</b> at the junk's bow, {{to which he}} replied, [...] "No sabbe." [...] The crew responded in like fashion, and though I made my meaning plain by signs, they refused to understand. Realizing the inexpediency of {{discussing}} the matter, I went forward myself, overran the line, and let the anchor go.|$|R
60|$|Never {{were the}} weathercocks watched more anxiously {{than they were}} by the {{officers}} and men of the Twenty-eighth for the next fortnight. The elements certainly appeared favorable to their wishes, and the wind blew steadily from the desired quarter, {{so that it was}} not until ten days after they were expected that the two transports which were to convey the Twenty-eighth <b>to</b> America <b>dropped</b> <b>anchor</b> in Cork harbor.|$|R
50|$|March 15: Arrival of Magellan's {{expedition}} {{to one of}} the Philippine Islands. They headed <b>to</b> Suluan and <b>dropped</b> <b>anchor</b> for a few hours of respite. Suluan is a small island in the province of Eastern Samar. They then next <b>dropped</b> <b>anchor</b> at Homonhon, another small island in the province of Eastern Samar. They were detected by the boats of Rajah Kolambu who was visiting Mazaua, who later guided them to Cebu, on April 7.|$|R
500|$|On 4 February 1999, New Carissa {{was bound}} for the Port of Coos Bay {{to pick up a}} load of wood chips. The ship's crew was {{informed}} by the local bar pilots that weather conditions would prevent the ship (which was empty at the time) from entering Coos Bay harbor until the next morning. The captain ordered the ship <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>anchor</b> [...] off the coast in order to ride out the storm. The crew used a single anchor to secure the ship. According to a United States Coast Guard review of the incident, the chain used was too short. The short chain and the weather conditions, including winds of , caused the ship to drag her anchor. Poor navigational techniques and inadequate watchkeeping led to the crew's failure to notice that the ship was moving. Once movement was detected, the crew attempted to raise anchor and maneuver away from the shore, but the weather and sea conditions made this difficult. By the time the anchor was raised, the ship had been pushed too close to the shore to recover.|$|E
500|$|Classical geographers such as Strabo and Pliny the Elder {{were slow}} to {{incorporate}} new information into their works and, from their positions as esteemed scholars, were seemingly prejudiced against lowly merchants and their topographical accounts. Ptolemy's work represents a break from this, since he demonstrated an openness to their accounts {{and would not have}} been able to chart the Bay of Bengal so accurately without the input of traders. In the 1st-century AD Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, its anonymous Greek-speaking author, a merchant of Roman Egypt, provides such vivid accounts of eastern trade cities that it is clear he visited many of them. These include sites in Arabia, Pakistan, and India, including travel times from rivers and towns, where <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>anchor,</b> the locations of royal courts, lifestyles of the locals and goods found in their markets, and favourable times of year to sail from Egypt to these places to catch the monsoon winds. The Periplus also mentions a great inland city, Thinae (or Sinae), in a country called This that perhaps stretched as far as the Caspian. The text notes that silk produced there travelled to neighbouring India via the Ganges and to Bactria by a land route. Marinus and Ptolemy had relied on the testimony of a Greek sailor named Alexander, probably a merchant, for how to reach Cattigara (most likely Óc Eo, Vietnam). Alexander (Greek: Alexandros) mentions that the main terminus for Roman traders was a Burmese city called Tamala on the north-west Malay Peninsula, where Indian merchants travelled overland across the Kra Isthmus to reach the Perimulic Gulf (the Gulf of Thailand). Alexandros claimed that it took twenty days to sail from Thailand to a port called [...] "Zabia" [...] (or Zaba) in southern Vietnam. According to him, one could continue along the coast (of southern Vietnam) from Zabia until reaching the trade port of Cattigara after an unspecified number of days (with [...] "some" [...] being interpreted as [...] "many" [...] by Marinus).|$|E
2500|$|... —a [...] {{from the}} 3rd Training Squadron {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Commander R C Mayne—was transferred to fishery protection duties. It left Chatham on August 27, 1958 {{to keep the}} squadron at full strength after it had been depleted by other vessels being withdrawn for refits. Unfortunately, one day after leaving, she was forced <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>anchor</b> off Sheerness after salt water was found in her boilers.|$|E
50|$|The {{location}} <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> the <b>anchor</b> {{should be}} approached from down wind or down current, whichever is stronger. As the chosen spot is approached, the vessel should be stopped or even beginning to drift back. The anchor should be lowered quickly but under control {{until it is}} on the bottom. The vessel should continue to drift back, and the cable should be veered out under control so it will be relatively straight.|$|R
60|$|When {{the tide}} again {{began to run}} out Edmund {{determined}} at all risks to proceed to sea. The moorings were cast off from the shore and the Dragon suffered to drift down. Men with poles took their stations in her bows and sounded continually, while at her stern two anchors were prepared in readiness <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> at a moment's notice. Several times the water shoaled so much that Edmund was {{on the point of}} giving orders <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> the <b>anchors,</b> but each time it deepened again.|$|R

2500|$|On 26 May, just as Gravina {{was about}} <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>anchor</b> off Collioure, a storm drove his fleet away. Accordingly, Navarro capitulated to Dugommier on the pledge to allow his 7,000 troops {{to return to}} Spain in {{exchange}} for releasing {{the same number of}} French prisoners. The term stipulated that neither the French nor the Spanish prisoners were to fight against the other side {{for the remainder of the}} war. Navarro was supposed to deliver up the Royalist legion, but he instead sent them away in small craft. If the Royalists had fallen into the hands of the French they would have been shot. The French overlooked this difficulty but were infuriated by what followed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1553 English {{explorer}} Hugh Willoughby {{with chief}} pilot Richard Chancellor were sent out with three vessels {{in search of}} a passage by London's Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands. During the voyage across the Barents Sea, Willoughby thought he saw islands to the north, and islands called Willoughby's Land were shown on maps published by Plancius and Mercator into the 1640s. The vessels were separated by [...] "terrible whirlwinds" [...] in the Norwegian Sea and Willoughby sailed into a bay near the present border between Finland and Russia. His ships with the frozen crews, including Captain Willoughby and his journal, were found by Russian fishermen a year later. Richard Chancellor was able <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>anchor</b> in the White Sea and trudge his way overland to Moscow and Ivan the Terrible's Court, opening trade with Russia and the Company of Merchant Adventurers became the Muscovy Company.|$|E
2500|$|By 09:00 on 25 October, {{the wind}} was rising towards gale strength. [...] Ledbetter was having {{difficulty}} keeping Cedar on station, and the smaller rescue boats that had run for shelter {{on the evening of}} the 24th were unable to return to the reef. [...] Ledbetter decided he would try to anchor Cedar about 500 yards downwind of the reef, shoot a line to Sophia (possibly using a Lyle gun), and then evacuate the passengers by breeches buoy. [...] This would have been extremely hazardous {{and it would have been}} unlikely that over 300 people could be removed by this method, but it seemed the only thing that could be done. [...] Ledbetter twice tried <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>anchor,</b> but each time it failed to catch on the bottom. [...] Locke could see this effort was failing, and radioed to Ledbetter that it was no use, they would have to wait for low tide when perhaps conditions might be better. [...] There was nothing else that could be done.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} several reasons {{presented}} for this closure, although all of them stem from the increased number of tourists visiting the site. One {{of the main reasons}} of the closure is that the coral in the area is being destroyed. The cause of coral destruction is thought to be a combination of global warming, presence of boat oil in the water due to excessive tour trips and physical destruction due <b>to</b> <b>dropping</b> of <b>anchors</b> up <b>to</b> 250 times a day.|$|R

60|$|The wind, however, {{continued}} very light, and {{the vessel}} did {{little more than}} drift with the tide, and when it turned at two o'clock they had <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>anchor</b> again close under some high land, {{on the top of}} which stood a lofty tower.|$|E

50|$|She and APL-28 collided, but {{the damage}} was {{repaired}} quickly, and she untangled herself from the anchor buoy. Between 15:15 and 15:58, she cleared the APL and attempted <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> her port <b>anchor</b> again.
