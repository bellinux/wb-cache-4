40|$|The {{atmospheric}} chemistry instrument Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) {{was launched in}} April 1995 on the ERS- 2 platform. The GOME data processor (GDP) operational retrieval algorithm has produced <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> columns since July 1995. With a data record of over ten years, GOME has become important for ozone trend analysis. In 2004, GDP was upgraded to version 4. 0, a new validation was performed, and the entire GOME data record was reprocessed. In the preceding paper (Van Roozendael et al., 2006), the GDP 4. 0 algorithm was described.

40|$|Validation of {{satellite}} data remains {{a high priority}} for the construction of climate data sets. Traditionally ground based measurements have provided the primary comparison data for validation. For some atmospheric parameters such as ozone, a thoroughly validated satellite data record can be used to validate a new instrument s data product in addition to using ground based data. Comparing validated data with new satellite data has several advantages; availability of much more data, which will improve precision, larger geographical coverage, and the footprints are closer in size, which removes uncertainty due to different observed atmospheric volumes. To demonstrate the applicability and some limitations of this technique, observations from the newly launched SCIAMACHY instrument were compared with the NOM- 16 SBW/ 2 and ERS- 2 GOME instruments. The SBW/ 2 data had all ready undergone validation by comparing to the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> ground <b>network.</b> Overall the SCIAMACHY data were found to low by 3 % with respect to satellite data and 1 % low with respect to ground station data. There appears to be seasonal and or solar zenith angle dependences in the comparisons with SBW/ 2 where differences increase with higher solar zenith angles. It is known that accuracies in both satellite and ground based <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> algorithms decrease at high solar zenith angles. There is a strong need for more accurate measurement from and the ground under these conditions. At the present time SCIAMACHY data are limited and longer data set with more coverage in both hemispheres is needed to unravel the cause of these differences...|$|R

40|$|The <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> {{variations}} over Europe (~ 50 ° N) in {{the period}} 1964 – 2004 are analyzed for detection of signals of ozone recovery. The ozone deviations from the long-term monthly means (1964 – 1980) for selected European stations, where the ozone observations (by the Dobson spectrophotometers) {{have been carried out}} continuously for at least 3 – 4 decades, are averaged and examined by a regression model. A new method is proposed to disclose both the ozone trend variations and date of the trend turnaround. The regression model contains a piecewise linear trend component and the terms describing the ozone response to forcing by "natural" changes in the atmosphere. Standard proxies for the dynamically driven ozone variations are used. The Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) methodology and principal component analysis are used to find an optimal set of the explanatory variables and the trend pattern. The turnaround of the ozone trend in 1994 is suggested from the pattern of the piecewise linear trend component. Thus, the changes in the ozone mean level are calculated over the periods 1970 – 1994 and 1994 – 2003, for both the original time series and the time series having "natural" variations removed. Statistical significance of the changes are derived by bootstrapping. A first stage of recovery (according to the definition of the International Ozone Commission), i. e. lessening of a negative trend, is found over Europe. It seems possible that the increase in the ozone mean level since 1994 of about 1 – 2 % is due to superposition of the "natural" processes. Comparison of the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> ground-based <b>network</b> (the Dobson and Brewer spectrophotometers) and the satellite (TOMS, version 8) data over Europe shows the small bias in the mean values for the period 1996 – 2004, but the differences between the daily ozone values from these instruments are not trendless, and this may hamper an identification of the next stage of the ozone recovery over Europe.

Large percentage differences in <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> at northern fall polar latitudes identified through the assimilation process are linked with excessive northward transport of water vapour west of Tharsis and over Arabia Terra.

The first two modes for <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> describe the anomalous <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> patterns associated with the extremes in the Southern Oscillation. The first mode has the largest loadings in the southern hemisphere (SH) subtropics and midlatitudes with an east-west dipole in antiphase with a tropical east-west dipole. The second mode has its largest loadings in the tropics with an east-west dipolar pattern. These modes are intimately related to variations in the mean temperature in the lower stratosphere, and this relation is such that the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> and mean temperature anomalies are positively correlated. The tropospheric temperature patterns are confined in the tropics, where temperature and <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> anomalies are negatively correlated.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} annual {{changes in}} <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> during the polar night at Syowa Station (69 °S, 40 °E). Antarctica. The <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> is almost constant from early June to early August each year. The springtime decrease in <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> started in early September in 1982 - 1990 and in middle August in 1991 - 1992. The rate of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> decrease in August {{is less than}} 1. 0 DU (Dobson Units) per day in 1982 - 1987 and increased to around 4. 0 DU per day in the 1990 s. The rate in September was around 1. 0 DU per day in the 1980 s and was around 2. 0 DU in the 1990 s. The very low <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> in September and October in the early 1990 s {{is due to the}} rapid decrease of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> in August and the early start of decrease of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> in the Antarctic stratosphere. Final warming at Syowa Station has been delayed 1. 2 days per year annually. This fact suggests that the large ozone decrease over Antarctica affects the meteorology in the stratosphere over Antarctica...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The climatological {{characteristics}} of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> over Estonia {{based on the}} <b>Total</b> <b>Ozone</b> Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data are discussed. The mean annual cycle during 1979 – 2000 for the site at 58. 3 ◦ N and 26. 5 ◦ E is compiled. The available ground-level data interpolated before TOMS, {{have been used for}} trend detection. During the last two decades, the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) corrected systematic decrease of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> from February–April was 3 ± 2. 6 % per decade. Before 1980, a spring decrease was not detectable. No decreasing trend was found in either the late autumn ozone minimum or in the summer <b>total</b> <b>ozone.</b> The QBO related signal in the spring <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> has an amplitude of ± 20 DU and phase lag of 20 months. Between 1987 – 1992, the lagged covariance between the Singapore wind and the studied <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> was weak. The spring (April–May) and summer (June–August) <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> have the best correlation (coefficient 0. 7) in the yearly cycle. The correlation between the May and August <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> is higher than the one between the other summer months. Seasonal power spectra of the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> variance show preferred periods with an over 95 % significance level. Since 1986, during the winter/spring, the contribution period of 32 days prevails instead of the earlier dominating 26 days. The spectral densities of the periods from 4 days to 2 weeks exhibit high interannual variability. Key words.

40|$|Both {{dynamical}} {{and chemical}} mechanisms have been advanced {{to explain the}} decrease in <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> in the Antarctic spring. Further analysis of satellite measurements show that during any one year, the September decline in <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> near the South Pole is compensated by an increase at midlatitudes. The <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> amount from 44 deg S to the pole remains almost unchanged from August through November even though both the polar and midlatitude values reach extremes during this period. These observations suggest that the variations within the spring season in south polar <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> are governed by dynamical redistribution rather than chemical processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{locations}} of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> stations and of stratospheric ozone samplings were presented. The samplings {{are concentrated in}} three areas: Japan, Europe, and India. Approximately 75 % of the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> measurements are made with Dobson instruments which offer the best international measurements. When well calibrated their accuracy is {{on the order of}} a few percent. It is found that although the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> percent is similar in both hemispheres, the northern hemisphere has 3 to 10 % more ozone than the southern hemisphere. The close association between <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> distribution and pressure distribution in the atmosphere is noted...|$|R
