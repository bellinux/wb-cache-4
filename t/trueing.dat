40|$|Precision glass {{moulding}} can efficiently be {{used for}} serial production of complex glass components for the optical industry. For mould inserts hard and high temperature resistant materials like ceramics and cemented carbides are used. These brittle materials {{are very difficult to}} machine. Especially filigree structured tool inserts cannot be machined in optical quality by ultra precise diamond milling or turning. Diamond profile grinding and subsequent abrasive profile polishing are capable of producing the necessary high shape accuracy and optical surface quality. Thus, for mould making, a novel process chain consisting of diamond profile grinding with electro discharge <b>trueing</b> and dressing and machine-based abrasive profile polishing is presented in this article by F. Klocke, E. Brinksmeier, O. Riemer, A. Klink, H. Schulte and H. Sarikaya. Finally, the successful application in the glass replication for the production of a cylindrical lens array is shown.

40|$|During {{this project}} tools for grinding, {{polishing}} and <b>trueing</b> application were coated with adhesive diamond layers. The suitability of these novel tools was proven by application tests {{performed by the}} company Winter-CVD. The G-values, that are a measure for the wear of the workpeice material per used carat of diamond, were about ten times higher for the CVD-diamond compared to conventional diamond tools (2000 instead of 120 - 250 cm" 3 /carat). By improvements of the used hot-filament coating process tools and wear parts up to diameters of 150 mm could be coated homogeneously. The coating thickness could be increased from the commonly used 5 #mu#m for cutting tool applications to more than 35 #mu#m. A very good adhesion technique is necessary {{to cope with the}} internal stress induced in the coating by the increase of coating thickness. These achievements were mainly possible by the following improvements: - Matching of the filament length and arrangement to the enlarged substrate geometries. -Development of a reliable turning feedthrough for substrates up to a diameter of 150 mm. - Matching of the process parameters to the new filament arrangement and the used substrate materials. - Increasing of the coating volume and the thermal isolation of the coating units. - Optimized pretreatment procedures for the used substrate materials. - Matching of the internal quality control (blast wear test) to the increased coating thickness and to the intended applications. The used substrate material was mainly siliconnitride, but also the suitability of cemented carbide and graphite was shown. The substrates had to be selected carefully concerning the surface state, the process of manufacture and the content of sintering aid materials. The roughness of the coatings can be determined over a very large range. By the process parameters the roughness can be controlled by the crystal-size and texture from 5 to less than 1 #mu#m. For higher coating thickness it is easier to adjust the roughness by structured substrates surfaces. Up to a roughness of 25 #mu#m this is most easily done by sandblasting methods. For higher roughness grinded structures in the substrate surface are recommended. Coating of structures to a size of 2 mm were no problem provided than the depth of the structures was not deeper than the mutual distance. (orig.)
