40|$|Every {{planning}} of a port development or {{design of a}} new harbour is confronted with the unique physical properties and related problems to be solved. On the other hand every port {{can be defined as}} a link in the transport chain involved in the transfer of cargo from one medium of transport to another. Every port and its connected <b>transhipment</b> <b>equipment</b> and transport means are designed for the same basic purposed and involves a port consists of a number of systems as: a. a system of signals (buoys and navigation aids) to enable the ship to make a safe landfall b. an anchorage for use while a ship is waiting due to tidal conditions or congestion c. pilot system d. a system of towage e. the quays with cargo handling facilities f. undercover and open storage g. inland transport system etc. I t is possible, therefore, to construct an imaginary port which incorporates this features. Nevertheless to determine the capacity of a portsystem, it is necessary to schematize the reality by leaving out all non relevant aspects. A powerful method {{that can be used in}} the complicated port systems is offered by the discrete computer simulation. Generally speaking simulation is used to study the dynamic behaviour of the harboursystem by experimentations with a model of that system. In this way it is possible to obtain data which in statistical sense are relevant to the original system. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

In GreenRail, the intention was {{to make use of}} the proven and state-of-the-art technology and services, using existing <b>equipment,</b> <b>transhipment</b> hubs, terminals and services.|$|R
30|$|Taking {{into account}} the {{transhipment}} and third party costs, the rail freight operator would have to identify ways to reduce to cost. Also {{there were a number}} of operational requirements, such as a frequent service operated in conjunction with passenger timetables. Linking to the previous discussion, the bundling of goods could lead to increased volumes, facilitating a multi-stop service. The interview with P&G suggested that multi-stop train services were not feasible without fast and reliable transhipment, where a freight train stopped in a terminal for only short transit time â€“ much like passenger train station stops. Such faster transhipment was unrealistic using traditional vertical <b>transhipment</b> techniques and <b>equipment</b> (forklift or gantry crane), leading us to recommend that a new transhipment technique would be required to reduce the building and operations cost of a rail terminal.|$|R
