But unfortunately economic value of Tuna has not been utilized properly so there was some economic value that loss because the fishermen did not do proper handling of Tuna after they are being caught. In addition, because using traditional equipment, the number of tuna caught by fishermen were very limited. Through the program of economic livelihood done by the university of syiah kuala, the fishermen have been trained to use technology based equipment so they can incrsae the amount of Tuna being prodced by them...|$|E

40|$|The Kragerø Waterways {{consist of}} 5 power plants {{downstream}} after Lake Toke, Dalsfos {{is the first}} of these power plants. As a deterministic flood control of Lake Toke and Dalsfos there has been designed a MPC. The MPC uses a horizon of 10 days with estimated influx of water into the Lake Toke water reservoir. As a preliminary task before the MPC is designed, an assessment of the requirements and constraints of Lake Toke was made. The primary constraint is to keep the level between an upper and lower limit regulated by NVE. A 2 state model designed by Bjørn Glemmestad was used <b>to</b> define Lake <b>Toke,</b> <b>to</b> further increase the precision of the model, assessment parameters was done.

The controller is validated by simulation a flood scenario with disturbances similar to a real flood situation, there was also added a secondary peak to resemble a rainfall. The objective is to keep the level between a lower and upper limit, lrv and hrv, with a goal to avoid an overshoot over hrv. The controller proved to avoid an overshoot when the weight lower limit in the performance index was lower than the upper limit. A weight on the control output also proved to create a more stable control output as well as avoiding an overshoot when the secondary rainfall arrived...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Undeniable signatures, {{introduced}} by Chaum and van Antwerpen, require a verifier {{to interact with}} the signer to verify a signature, and hence allow the signer to control the verifiability of his signatures. Convertible undeniable signatures, {{introduced by}} Boyar, Chaum, Damg˚ard, and Pedersen, furthermore allow the signer to convert signatures to publicly verifiable ones by publicizing a verification token, either for individual signatures or for all signatures universally. In addition, the signer is able to delegate the ability to prove validity and convert signatures to a semi-trusted third party by providing a verification key. While the latter functionality is implemented by the early convertible undeniable signature schemes, the recent schemes do not consider this despite its practical appeal. In this note we present an updated definition and security model for schemes allowing delegation, and highlight a security property, token soundness, which is often implicitly assumed but not formally treated in the description of the security model for convertible undeniable signatures. We also note that the straightforward implementations of the efficient convertible undeniable signature schemes recently proposed by Phong, Kurosawa and Ogata do not allow a verifier to check the correctness of a public key, which essentially allows a malicious signer <b>to</b> break the <b>toke...</b>|$|R
