Egypt had not had an embassy in Yemen since 1961; therefore when Cairo requested information from the US ambassador to Yemen, all he provided was an economic report on the country.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1943 the Axis forces had complete control of the airspace over Yugoslavian territory.

The Italians refused to supply the requested Macchi C.200 and Macchi C.202 fighters, as the Regia Aeronautica needed every aircraft to fill its own squadrons in {{the beginning of}} 1943.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to punishing soldiers, tightening dismissal regulations {{and reducing the}} number of Vietnamese servicemen in France, the French decided to improve the military intelligence service. This was to be achieved by strengthening military intelligence through closer coordination with the Sûreté, and by raising internal standards. An inquiry into the mutiny at showed that cooperation between Resident Massimi and Commandant Le Tacon did not exist despite multiple requests, and that it was partly responsible for the uprising. The relationship between the civilian and military authorities were traditionally poor, but Yen Bay stood out in the <b>total</b> <b>lack</b> of military-civilian cooperation. Further VNQDĐ conspiracies to foment mutinies in other garrisons, such as Kiến An, were detected and scotched at late notice. It was decided that the teamwork with the Sûreté had to be raised to greater heights to prevent future Yen Bay style rebellions. The rebellion allowed the civilian authorities an opportunity to involve themselves in military matters.|$|E

40|$|This study uses {{data from}} the module on {{planning}} and financial literacy devised for the Health and Retirement Study in 2004.

These findings have important implications for policy and for programs aimed at fostering financial security. Because financial illiteracy is widespread among women, a one-time financial education seminar is unlikely to sufficiently influence planning and saving decisions. Similarly, education programs targeted specifically at women may be better suited to addressing large differences in preferences, savings needs, and financial knowledge. ...|$|R

It therefore announced the proposed closure of the line (including Groombridge and the West station) from 16 May 1983 which was later deferred after public objections. The Secretary of State for Transport agreed to the withdrawal of passenger services which took effect from 6 July 1985, although the section between Tunbridge Wells West and Birchden Jn remained open for rolling stock movements until 10 August, when the depot at the West station was shut.|$|E

40|$|HIV {{has become}} one of the most feared {{diseases}} in the world. It has claimed millions of lives, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although it is impossible to cure, studies have shown that using antiretroviral therapy (ART) can greatly improve quality of life and decrease viral load. There are four main classes of ART—NRTIs, NNRTIs, protease inhibitors, and fusion inhibitors. Although access to ART is improving, it is vital that its use is increased in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the prevalence can be as high as 33 %. This thesis explores the current need of ART in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as the existing coverage. In addition, it addresses the obstacles preventing ART distribution and use—both provider and patient-related. Provider-related obstacles include limited availability of drugs, <b>total</b> cost, <b>lack</b> of healthcare staff and facilities, lack of organization, and government regulations. Patient-related obstacles include cost, transportation, geographic proximity to healthcare facilities, side effects and hunger, pill burden, hospital-related factors, cultural beliefs, social stigma, lack of adequate counseling, and drug resistance. It is important to be proactive, assess ART delivery, consider suggestions for improvement, and tackle the HIV epidemic...|$|R
