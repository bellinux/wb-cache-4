[...] The station's founder, Vincent Kraft, initially operated 7XC out of his home. At the time he received the KJR call letters, the station was operating in the Times Square Building in downtown Seattle. In 1925, Kraft moved the station to the Terminal Sales Building, where he had erected a 50-foot mast {{to serve as the}} station's transmitter, which was soon superseded by a new, <b>T-wire</b> transmitter built in North City near Lake Forest Park completed in 1927 (later the site of Saint Mark's Catholic Church), at which point the studios were moved to the Home Savings Building at 1520 Westlake Ave. [...] Kraft sold the station to businessman Adolph Linden in 1928. Linden, and a subsequent owner, Ahira Pierce, were jailed for illegally financing the station with money from financial institutions which went bankrupt, and KJR was then acquired by NBC. [...] In 1933, NBC leased the station to the Fisher family, which owned KOMO radio, who moved the studios to the Skinner Building. [...] The Fisher family eventually purchased KJR in 1941. [...] In 1936, KJR became an affiliate of the NBC Blue Network, and continued this affiliation after the Blue Network became ABC in the 1940s. In 1937, a new transmitter was erected on Seattle's West Waterway, which operated until 1996. [...] By 1945, the Fisher family was forced to sell KJR to comply with an order from the FCC, and KJR was acquired by Birt Fisher, who was unrelated to the KOMO owners. [...] In 1946, KJR was purchased by Marshall Field and continued its affiliation with ABC until 1953, when ABC switched to KING-AM. [...] In July, 1952, Marshall Field sold the station to a group headed by Chicago businessman Ralph E. Stolkin, which sold it seven months later following Stolkin's departure to two Portland businessmen, Theodore Gamble and Howard Lane. [...] Following the purchase of the station by Lester Smith in 1954, KJR became a pioneer Top 40 radio station, continuing with this format until 1982. Smith moved the studios to the transmitter site on West Waterway in 1955. [...] In 1957, the station was sold to entertainers Danny Kaye and Frank Sinatra, and Smith stayed on as general manager. [...] Sinatra sold his interest in the station to Smith in 1964, and the resulting partnership became known as [...] "Kaye-Smith Enterprises." [...] In the 1960s, under the programming guidance of Pat O'Day, the station was top rated in Seattle and well known for introducing the Pacific Northwest to many recording stars such as Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, Merrilee Rush & The Turnabouts and the Ventures. Today, the call letters are used by KJR-FM, which broadcasts a format that includes many of the songs and shows (including original American Top 40 shows from the 1970s) from that era.|$|E
40|$|We use an atomistic tight-binding {{theory to}} study arrays of T-shaped GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wires. An atomistic {{approach}} {{allows us to}} provide a theory of the electron and hole states in T shaped wires without the approximations that limit effective mass models. We calculate the band structure of electron and holes in periodic <b>T-wire</b> arrays and in arm wells and compare {{with the results of}} effective mass theory. We determine the dispersion of single-particle states in a <b>T-wire</b> array and compare energies for arm-well and <b>T-wire</b> states...|$|E
40|$|We have {{calculated}} the optical absorption spectra of magnetoexcitons in <b>T-wire</b> semiconductor. It is calculated using the semiconductor Bloch equations {{in time and}} real-space domains. The peak and the linewitdth of the fundamental exciton transition are investigated {{as a function of}} the applied magnetic and static electric field. The latter is applied along the wire axis and induces a broadening in the absorption spectra line, energy shift, and the characterisitic Franz-Keldysh oscillations. The exciton binding energy enhances increasing the magnetic field strength. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose that}} the {{recently}} realized T-shaped semiconductor quantum wires (<b>T-wires)</b> could be exploited as three-terminal quantum interference devices. <b>T-wires</b> are formed by intersecting two quantum wells (QWs). By use of a scattering matrix approach and the Landauer-BÃ¼ttiker theory, we calculate the conductance for ballistic transport in the parent QWs and across the wire region {{as a function of}} the injection energy. We show that different conductance profiles can be selected by tailoring the widths of the QWs and/or combining more wires on the scale of the Fermi wavelength. Finally, we discuss the possibility of obtaining spin-dependent conductance of ballistic holes in the same structures. Comment: To appear in the 09 / 15 / 97 issue of Appl. Phys. Lett.

40|$|A set of {{analytic}} equations for {{calculating the}} binding energies of excitons in T-shaped and squared quantum well wires are established within the effective mass approximation and the two-band model. The resolution is {{performed in the}} framework of the variational method. The projections of the relative movement in a lateral plane (2 D exciton) and along the free movement direction (1 D exciton) are examined as limiting cases. Binding energies and spatial extensions of the exciton as functions {{of the size of the}} wire for both the ground and the first excited states are calculated in the case of GaAs/GaAlAs heterostructures for T-shaped and squared geometries. The method is applied to calculate the effects on the excitons induced by the application of crossed electric and magnetic fields. Comparison between quantum wells, <b>T-wires</b> and squared wires is given...|$|R
40|$|THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS THESIS WAS THE ACCURATE,EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENT OF THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF NEW ALTERNATIVE REFRIGERANTS, USING THE TRANSIT HOT-WIRE-METHOD (THW). A NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF THE COMPLETE, PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL WORKING SET OF EQUATION S, WHICH DESCRIBES, FULLY, THE REAL EXPERIMENTAL SITUATION, WAS DEVELOPED, USING THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD (FEM). THE NEW NUMERICAL APPROACH A) FULLY AGREES WITH THE ANALYTICAL SOLUTION OF THE THW METHOD, USED SO FAR, FOR THE ACCURATE CALCULATION OF THER MAL CONDUCTIVITY OF LIQUIDSAND GASEA AT MODERATED PRESSURES AND B) CALCULATES ACCURATELY, FOR THE FIRSTTIME, THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF GASES IN THE LOW PRESSURE, LOW DENSITY REGION, WHERE THE ANALYTICAL SOLUTION FAILED BEFORE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPLET ESET OF PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL QUESTIONS, WHICH DESCRIBES THE COMPRESSION WORK IN THE THW METHOD, WAS DEVELOPED AND SOLVED ANALYTICALLY AND NUMERICALLY, REVEALING ITS NEGLIGBLE INFLUENCE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE METHOD. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPLETE SET OF PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS, WHICH DESCRIBES THE FREE CONVECTION MECHANISM IN THE APPLICATION OF THE EXPARIMENTAL METHOD, WAS SOLVED NUMERICALLY USING FINITE DIFFERENCE METHOD. BASED ON THE THEORITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE METHOD, TWO NEW TRANSIENT HO <b>T-WIRE</b> INSTRUMENTS WERE DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED, ONE FOR EXPERIMENTAL MEASURMENTS IN THE LIQUID PHASE AND ONE FOR THE GAS PHASE. THE NEW INSTRUMENTS WERE USED FOR THE THERMALCONDUCTIVITY MEASURMENTS OF LIQUID TOLUENE, EIGHT NEW ALTERNATIVE REFRIGERANT S IN THE LIQUID PHASE AND THREE NEW ALTERNATIVE REFR...|$|E
