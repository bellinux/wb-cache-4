40|$|ABSTRACT During {{the last}} quarter of a century, Iran has {{undergone}} funda-mental changes. The revolution was supported by a heterogeneous coalition of social forces, but it led <b>to</b> a <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> and the stabilization of an Islamic regime. Since the end of the 1980 s, four different types of new social actors have emerged in Iran: post-Islamist intellectuals; feminists; students as a non-revolutionary, reformist and democratically minded group; and ethnic move-ments. These actors mostly (with the exception of some intellectuals) belong to a generation which did not take part in the revolution; their aspirations and demands are totally different from those most characteristic of the revolution-ary phase. The election of President Khatami in 1997 was a result of these changes. Since then, a stalemate has prevailed: the society is post-Islamist, whereas the decisive power centres are controlled by Islamist conservatives.

5000|$|The {{review was}} {{published}} on 14 July 2004. Its main conclusion was that key intelligence used <b>to</b> justify the <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> {{has been shown}} to be unreliable. It claims that the Secret Intelligence Service did not check its sources well enough and sometimes relied on third hand reports. It says that there was an over-reliance on Iraqi dissident sources. It also comments that warnings from the Joint Intelligence Committee on the limitations of the intelligence were not made clear. Overall it said that [...] "more weight was placed on the intelligence than it could bear", and that judgements had stretched available intelligence [...] "to the outer limits".|$|R
50|$|On February 5, 2003, Powell {{appeared}} before the UN to prove the urgency <b>to</b> engage a <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq.</b> Although the presentation failed to change the fundamental position of the Security Council, including France, Russia, China, and Germany, Powell succeeded in hardening the overall tone of the United Nations towards Iraq. Powell also noted that Iraq harbored a terrorist network headed by al-Qaeda operative Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (in a small region controlled by Ansar al-Islam). Powell also claimed that Iraqis visited Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and provided training to al-Qaeda members, although thousands of Arabs from many countries did the same. US intelligence agencies have {{found no evidence of}} any substantive collaboration between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. While Colin Powell's statement to the UN may have been accepted as proof by many in the US, {{this was not the case}} in Europe.|$|R

The United States Air Force Academy and the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), in particular, supported Kirstein's efforts to express freely his views on matters of public concern. They opposed denying academic freedom through suspension and a so-called reprimand, for pacifist speech that challenged war and the use of force.|$|R
40|$|Efforts by the Gulf Co-operation Council {{to persuade}} Iran <b>to</b> end its <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> in {{exchange}} for access to {{a large amount of}} capital during the late spring of 1982 were not only ignored by the Iranian government but also met with greatly increased demands for reparations on the part of Iranian leaders. This event raises at least two important questions regarding the use of positive sanctions as a way of ending inter-national conflicts: under what conditions an offer of positive sanctions will be made and under what conditions such an offer will be accepted or refused. These questions can be addressed from at least two very different perspectives. In domestic political terms, small principalities such as those on the Arab side of the Arab/Persian Gulf have a variety of incentives to use rewards in their dealings with more powerful neighbors, particularly if they have a reservoir of fungible resources from which to draw. In structural terms, when the distribution of capabilities in a region such as the Gulf is changing from a bipolar to a multipolar one, countries whose situation is improving will have several incentives to try to bring regional conflicts to an end using positive sanctions. Thus there is little basis for choosing between these two perspectives as a better explanation for why rewards were offered to Iran <b>to</b> end its <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> during June 1982. But structural features of the Gulf region provide a considerably better explanation for why this offer was rejected than domestic political factors do. Domestic-level arguments explaining the rejection of rewards contradict the logic according to which their having been offered in the first place is explained. Structural aspects of the situation in the Gulf in early 1982 not only predict that smaller countries should have tried to use rewards to settle conflict in the area but also suggest why larger combatants will not accept such an offer. This finding indirectly supports Kenneth Waltz’s argument that conflicts in a multipolar world will be both more likely to occur and more difficult to solve. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Islamic Republic of Iran was proclaimed on 1 April 1979 {{after the}} results of a {{referendum}} in which allegedly more than 98% voted for this system. The Provisional Government took office on 12 February, right after the former regime fell, but it quickly became apparent that this government lacked any real power, which was instead concentrated in the Islamic Revolutionary Council (which was dominated by hard-line religious fundamentalists) and the local Islamic Komitehs (committees) which were executing thousands of Iranians. The PG was composed mainly of elements from the FMI (including Bazargan, Taleghani, Sahabi, Yazdi, Nazih and Bani-Sadr), but also included a few leaders of the National Front (Sanjabi, Ardalan, Forouhar). This period expressed the height of the LMI's influence over Iranian politics, but it was not to last. By Aug. 1979, the new regime was clamping down on dissent, outlawing nearly all political parties and instituting a campaign of terror against its critics. The Bazargan cabinet resigned en masse on 5 November 1979, and thus, ended the Interim Government of Iran. The Islamic regime (led by Ayatollah Khomeini) crushed all dissent in the country so that the oppositionists, both real and potential, either fled abroad or were murdered or imprisoned. But the LMI continued to exist as a barely tolerated force in the Majlis, where it called for an early end <b>to</b> the <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> in 1984 (the war had started in September 1980 when Iraqi forces, under the orders of President Saddam Hussein, invaded Iran).|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} concerned with the literary aspects of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Its immediate focus rests {{on the evolution of}} the Islamic republican poetic trend, encompassing both the disillusioned and conformist voices that rose to prominence {{in the course of the}} 1979 Revolution and their on-going engagement with the ruling political power. In this vein, this thesis investigates the various cultural policies of the state, as well as select political transformations of the past three decades, all of which played a pivotal role in this literary evolution. The thesis shows how the official poets that emerged during the 1979 Revolution, and which proved significantly active throughout the immediate history subsequent <b>to</b> that event (<b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq,</b> the death of Ayatollah Khomeini and the rise and fall of the reform movement), evolved over time and thereby either received political support for their commitment to the state ideology or became gradually excluded from official cultural institutions. Finally, this thesis reviews the manner in which state strategies have shaped an institutionalised form of poetry that is monitored and reinforced by the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic and official cultural authorities. It demonstrates how an innate linking of the project of Islamic republican literature to underlying ideologically defined notions such as 'religious verse', 'legitimate poetry' and 'commitment' was and continues to be an intrinsic part of the literary foundations of the ideological apparatus of the Islamic Republic. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the processes of}} continuity and change in modern Iran,covering the period {{before and after the}} 1979 revolution, analysing the changing character of Shia Islam historically to explain Shia thinkers' perception of and response to the modern world. In making this assessment, elements of the history of Shia Islam are examined. This is to illustrate its relationship with modernity, not as a historical treatment of Islam. In explaining its relationship to modernity, this study identifies the nature of the development of the Iranian political economy - from pre-capitalism to modern capitalism - as having taken an uneven form. This unevenness is largely a consequence of the incorporation of the old mode of production into modern capitalism. The key area in this process has been the modern oil industry and its relation to the state - which emerged as a rentier state (a state which receives a huge amount of income without the need to impose high taxation), and continues to {{play a vital role in}} Iran's political economy. The uneven development is reflected in social and cultural areas, where there has not been uniformity in the integration to the world economy; rather the adaptation to new developments has been uneven. Shia Islam as an ideology has not been immune from this process: the original ideas and beliefs may be presented anew but the core survives, in the Koran, Hadith (sayings of Prophet) and traditions. Religious leaders have had to concern themselves with the transformation occurring within the community, whether at local or global level. The role of Shia thinkers becomes vital in explaining major transformation in their perceptions, promoting an understanding of modern institutions such as the nation, state and constitution. The establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979 showed elements of both continuity and discontinuity in the perception of Shia thinkers and these are examined, in particular, concerning the role of the state and the oil industry. This continued to play a vital role after the revolution, as the state still had to obey the dictates of the world market, for the export of its oil and import, not only of necessary raw materials and capital goods for the operation of the nationalised industries, but also to provide the supply of arms required <b>to</b> fight its <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq.</b> Forced by these economic and political constraints, Shia thinkers' perceptions relating to modernisation continues to present itself in diverse forms. ...|$|R
