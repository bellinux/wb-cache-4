An entire generation of identical workers was {{divided into two groups}} whose outcome in food foraging was controlled.

As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer <b>times.</b> <b>A</b> <b>month</b> later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care.|$|E
5|$|The Central Committee {{was not a}} {{permanent}} institution. It convened plenary sessions. Seven CC plenary sessions and two plenary sessions held {{in conjunction with the}} convening of the Central Control Commission were held between the 16th Congress and the 17th Congress. When the CC was not in session, decision-making power was vested in the internal bodies of the CC itself; that is, the Politburo, Secretariat and Orgburo. None of these bodies were permanent either; typically they convened several <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over {{the first}} ten years of the society's existence, the {{organization}} grew in membership and held meetings {{at least twice a}} month, and usually four <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> The society debated an extensive range of subjects including scientific, religious, political, and social topics, often violating the constitution's rules banning religious and political subjects. The society's debates were often acrimonious and regularly spilled beyond the confines of the meetings and into the community. Between January 30, 1819 and January 22, 1830, the society's membership rolls reached 52 members; although as few as 15 members attended the bimonthly meetings, and no more than 17 members were ever present at a meeting.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} gaining relevant knowledge about the attitudes toward sport advertising among the question how often consumers participate in sports activities The sample included 433 respondents, divided into six subsample groups: consumers who {{do not participate in}} sport activities at all, then consumers who participate in sport activities less than ones <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> next 1 – 4 <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> 5 – 10 <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> 11 – 20 <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> as well as consumers participate in sport activities more than 20 <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>months.</b> The sample of variables contained the system of three general attitudes which were modeled by seven-point Likert scale.

5|$|The cuisine of Rwanda {{is based}} on local staple foods {{produced}} by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat {{more than a few}} <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.|$|E

25|$|In Livy's account, the new Bacchic mysteries were {{originally}} restricted {{to women and}} held only three times a year; but were corrupted by the Etruscan-Greek version, and thereafter drunken {{men and women of}} all ages and social classes cavorted in a sexual free-for-all five <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> Livy relates their various outrages against Rome's civil and religious laws and morality; a secretive, subversive and potentially revolutionary counter-culture. The cult was suppressed by the State with great ferocity; of the 7,000 arrested, most were executed. Modern scholarship treats much of Livy's account with skepticism; more certainly, a Senatorial edict, the Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus was distributed throughout Roman and allied Italy. It banned the former Bacchic cult organisations. Each meeting must seek prior senatorial approval through a praetor. No more than three women and two men were allowed at any one meeting, Those who defied the edict risked the death penalty.|$|E

500|$|One {{particular}} market {{target that}} was {{of importance to}} the company was identified as the [...] "Superfan". The superfan was a demographic group that included individuals that are 18 to 49 years old, primarily male, who would visit a fast-food restaurant five <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> and eat fast food 16 <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> Burger King and their competitors hope to attract this group {{because of the large}} sums of money that they represent; an increase in sales to this group could drive an increase in global sales. While superfans accounted for less than 20 percent of Burger King's customer base, they accounted for nearly 50 percent of the company's business. By focusing on this demographic group, the company could increase sales more readily; it was easier to generate more repeat visits by this demographic than it was to coax new customers to switch from other chains. The company has used advertising featuring its mascot, the Burger King, in tandem with new product rollouts such as its BK Wrapper product to help generate an increased number of visits by this client segment.|$|E
