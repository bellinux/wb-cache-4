5|$|Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) {{is seated}} in a chair in Assistant Director Walter Skinner's office, where he is shown a video from the morgue. Skinner tells him that Miles is somehow alive and still out to get Scully and her unborn child. Suddenly, Agent Gene Crane comes to Doggett and tells him {{that there is a}} person—Knowle Rohrer—who wants to see him, about issues {{concerning}} Miles and Scully. This leaves Fox Mulder and Skinner to interrogate Krycek. Rohrer fabricates a story to Doggett that Miles is part of a Military Project to create a super soldier and that Scully had a chip put in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> during her abduction to make her pregnant with the first organic version of a super soldier.|$|E
5|$|Melvin Frohike visits Scully's {{apartment}} and shows her {{a newspaper article}} about Kenneth Soona's murder. When she returns to FBI headquarters, the metal detector curiously goes off. Scully presents Skinner with the newspaper article, thinking that the data from Soona's death can clear Mulder in his father's murder. Skinner, however, refuses to do any follow-up on it. After Scully leaves it is revealed that the Cigarette Smoking Man was waiting in an adjacent room to question Skinner about the exchange. Leaving the building, Scully has a hunch upon seeing the metal detector again that leads to locating metal in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> Scully sees a doctor, who removes a small metal implant.|$|E
5|$|During the trip, The Smoking Man tells Scully that he {{believes}} he shares a special kinship with her because he once held her own life in his hands. Mulder finds a message Scully left on his phone suspicious and goes to her apartment, where the landlord tells him that she left with someone else. The Smoking Man and Scully arrive {{at the home of}} Marjorie Butters (Louise Latham), a 118-year-old gardener who also has the chip implanted in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> Meanwhile, Mulder visits Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) to voice his concern, but Scully calls Skinner during the meeting and says that she is fine. At a gas station, Scully removes the wire, places it in an envelope, and mails it to Mulder. However, a man following the two removes the letter from the mailbox.|$|E

5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan is a {{woman who}} {{obtained}} her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, {{is a woman}} who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.|$|E
25|$|Young moviegoers began emulating romantic {{stars on}} the screen, such as Ronald Colman and Rudolph Valentino, the latter known for ending his passionate scenes with a kiss. Valentino also began his romantic scenes with women by kissing her hand, {{traveling}} up her arm, and then kissing her on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> Female actresses were often turned into stars based on their screen portrayals of passion. Actresses like Nazimova, Pola Negri, Vilma Bánky and Greta Garbo, became screen idols as a result.|$|E
25|$|Dushku {{visited her}} father's family in Albania in 2006 after {{receiving}} {{an invitation from}} Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha. She visited Kosovo and received an Albanian Eagle tattoo on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> While on her second visit to Albania in 2011, she applied for Albanian citizenship and obtained the Albanian passport and ID Card. She became an honorary citizen of Tirana, and was given the honorary title of Tirana Ambassador of Culture and Tourism in the World by Tirana mayor Lulzim Basha. Additionally, she was given honorary citizen status in her father's home town of Korçë, Albania.|$|E

25|$|In Season 2, Scully {{was kidnapped}} by an ex-FBI mental patient named Duane Barry, and then taken from Barry by a {{military}} covert operation that were working with the alien conspirators, but was later returned. In Season 3 she found out that a super hi-tech microchip has been implanted in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> After having it removed, she developed cancer in the fourth season and was hospitalized after the cancer became terminal. She was saved after Mulder broke into the Department of Defense to retrieve another chip to be implanted back into her neck. At the time, Scully was also undergoing experimental medical treatments and was having a dramatic renewal of her faith.|$|E
25|$|Also spelled langsuir or lang suyar, {{it is said}} to be {{the ghost}} of a woman who died while giving birth to a {{stillborn}} child which turns into a pontianak, or during pregnancy before the forty days of uncleanness have expired. The mother's grief changes her into a type of flying banshee. To prevent a pregnant woman's corpse from becoming a lang suir, glass beads are placed into the mouth, an egg is placed in each armpit, and needles are placed in the hands. The lang suir can appear as a beautiful woman with long nails (a traditional mark of beauty), ankle-length hair and dressed in green. They also have the ability to take the form of an owl with long talons. Being fond of eating fish, they usually haunt coastal areas and attack pregnant women out of jealousy. It is possible to tame a lang suir by cutting off her long nails and stuffing the hair into the hole at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|E
500|$|McLeod has the Roman numerals [...] "X X IX" [...] tattooed down <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> {{representing}} the 29th Olympiad.

500|$|The black hennin is long, {{truncated}} {{and relatively}} plain [...] with a transparent veil which falls around <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> resting briefly on her shoulder. Probably it was kept relatively unadorned {{so as not}} to distract from the [...] necklace. Her costume is mostly black or brown, with a wide but high neckline and white fur lined hems on the sleeves. Portinari has dark eyes, a strong nose, full lips and a pointed chin. Her visible hand, folded in prayer but unrealistically off center, wears what looks like a jeweled ring. The dark sleeves of her dress contain red or rouge velvet-like cloth tightened by a white belt. Her hair is shaved back to achieve the high forehead and sculptural look fashionable at the time.|$|E
500|$|The obverse {{depicts a}} head of Liberty in the Greco-Roman style, [...] facing left, with her hair pulled back—according to numismatists Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth, [...] "attractively"—in a bun. [...] Some of her hair descends <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck.</b> [...] She wears a coronet, inscribed [...] "Liberty", and is {{surrounded}} by thirteen stars, representative of the original states, and the year of issue. The reverse features a heraldic eagle, holding a double ribbon, on which [...] "E Pluribus Unum" [...] is inscribed. The double ribbon is an allusion by Longacre to the denomination of the piece he was designing. The design is a variant on the Great Seal of the United States; the eagle protects a shield, which represents the nation, and holds an olive branch and arrows. Above the bird, Longacre again placed thirteen stars, arranged as a halo, together with an arc of rays.|$|E
500|$|The video, which Beyoncé has {{considered}} intimate and romantic, begins as she stands against a wall, illuminated by light that {{passes through a}} window. In one scene, Beyoncé's character, dressed in a skin-tight leotard, performs a dance sequence while her love interest {{looks down at her}} from a balcony. According to Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly, the dance routines pay homage to the 1983 romantic drama film Flashdance. Beyoncé and Ealy later stare adoringly at each other as they snuggle on a sofa. During the climax of the video, Beyoncé is shown underwater, dressed in white, moving slowly upwards. As the chorus begins, she opens her eyes; after Ealy kisses <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> the pair come face to face in the final scene, in which Beyoncé lies in bed, with Ealy above her. Jennifer Cady of E! Online wrote that the bright shiny lights in the video [...] "make [...] look like an angel". Alison Maloney of The Sun praised Beyoncé's [...] "amazing figure". The video was ranked at number 74 on BET's Notarized: Top100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E

500|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan may {{be either}} a {{beautiful}} old or young woman who obtained her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklores to be dark or demonic in nature.

2500|$|JoJo didn't want to {{keep her}} fans waiting for new music due to ongoing label issues; thus, she began {{recording}} material specifically for the mixtape. Originally JoJo thought of naming the mixtape Live Free or Die after the New Hampshire state motto (which inspired the tattoo on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>neck),</b> but upon further thought, JoJo stated [...] "it sounded dramatic and militant and scary. And that is SO not {{what this is all}} about! Its really about friends coming together and bonding over a mutual love for music then seeing what grows out of it. Not about industry politics, agendas, empty-promises, ego, swag, pretension, or a budget of any kind." ...|$|E
