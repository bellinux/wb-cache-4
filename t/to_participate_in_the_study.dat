25|$|During {{the grant}} {{meetings}} in May 1971 {{some of the}} scientists, including Jay Shurley and David Elkind, voiced concern that the prevailing methods of research pursued scientific study {{at the expense of}} Genie's well-being and could cause love and attention to be contingent on her language acquisition. Shurley said that there was strong disagreement during the initial grant meetings and the atmosphere grew increasingly tense and bitter, especially noting that the later meetings excluded {{many of the people who}} had worked most closely with Genie. After May 1971 Elkind declined <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> further, despite having personally known both the Riglers for several years, and in an interview years later he cited a desire not to be involved in a case which, in his view, prioritized scientific research over Genie's care. While Shurley acknowledged that the scientists at the center of the case were in a completely unprecedented situation, he also decided to minimize his involvement over these concerns and felt that by the conclusion of the study all of the scientists, including himself, had been guilty to varying degrees of using Genie as an object and putting themselves and their goals ahead of her and her mother's best interests.|$|E

[...] Converting this segment to a boulevard would free up [...] of land for development which is currently used for the freeway and its right-of-way. The department invited businesses and other groups affected by the potential project <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> in November 2013. Advocates of the conversion cite increased pedestrian access and an improved connection between Eastern Market and downtown as reasons to remove the freeway. Some people who live or work along the freeway and in the downtown area note the improved access I-375 provides to the area as reasons to retain the freeway.|$|E

She co-starred in her own television series, All's Fair, with Richard Crenna in 1976–77.

[...] Although Peters was praised for her charismatic performance, the show ran for only one season. [...] Peters was nominated for a Golden Globe award as Best TV Actress– Musical/Comedy. [...] In March 2005, she made a pilot for an ABC situation comedy series titled Adopted, co-starring with Christine Baranski, but it was not picked up.

She played the role of Barbara, an art teacher with breast cancer, who is initially reluctant <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> for the cancer drug Herceptin. Andrew Gans of Playbill wrote, [...] "Peters is able to choose from an expansive emotional palette to color the character, and her performance... is moving, humorous and ultimately spirit-raising".|$|E

The PHS asked black Tuskegee Institute physicians <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> by offering funds, employment, and interns to encourage the ongoing participation of the patients. Additionally, the study intentionally employed Eunice Rivers, a black nurse from Macon County, to be primary source of contact and build personal, trusting relationships with patients to promote their participation. To ensure that the men would {{show up for the}} possibly dangerous, painful, diagnostic, and non-therapeutic spinal taps, the doctors sent the 400 patients a misleading letter titled [...] "Last Chance for Special Free Treatment". The study also required all participants to undergo an autopsy after death in order to receive funeral benefits. After penicillin was discovered as a cure, researchers continued to deny such treatment to many study participants. Many patients were lied to and given placebo treatments so that researchers could observe the full, long-term progression of the fatal disease.|$|E

5000|$|Hartman and Baldwin [...] discuss further {{advantages}} of the Real-Time Delphi approach: First, the number of experts participating in the real-time study can be increased due to {{a higher degree of}} automation during and improved possibilities for analysis after the study. Additionally, the Internet provides the possibility to invite a worldwide expert panel <b>to</b> <b>participate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> Second, the degree of interaction among the experts can be increased {{due to the fact that}} they can immediately react on others’ comments. Additionally, the time frame between giving own answers and getting insights into others’ responses is very short, which encourages stronger cognitive examination with the respective issue in question. Hartman and Baldwin [...] argue that with the help of this procedure the validity of results is maximised.|$|E
