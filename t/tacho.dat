500|$|The {{plan was}} put into motion in autumn 1952 by the CIA. J.C. King had {{obtained}} weapons from the stock of those that had been confiscated by port authorities {{in the city of}} New York. These included 250 rifles, 380 pistols, 64 machine guns, and 4500 grenades. The United Fruit Company lent one of its freighters to the CIA. The freighter was specially refitted and loaded with weapons in New Orleans under the guise of agricultural machinery. It was scheduled to sail to Nicaragua in early October 1952. The CIA had encouraged Somoza and Galvez to provide support to Castillo Armas' forces. Somoza, however, informed several government officials across Central America of the CIA's role in the coup attempt. Somoza's son <b>Tacho,</b> for instance, casually asked Miller whether [...] "the machinery" [...] was on its way at a meeting in Panama.|$|E

60|$|The {{fifteen years}} of Theban power had {{weakened}} Sparta; but Agesilaus persuaded the Ephors {{to send him to}} assist <b>Tachos,</b> who had revolted from the Persians and made himself king of Egypt, and who promised to pay the Spartans well for their aid. When he sent his officers to receive the Spartan king who had achieved the greatest fame of any man then living, they absolutely burst out laughing {{at the sight of the}} little, lame man, now more than eighty years old, and as simply clad as ever; and he was much vexed and angered that he was not made commander of the army, but only of the foreign allies; and when <b>Tachos</b> went against his advice, and chose to march into Phœnicia, he went over to the cause of another Egyptian prince, a cousin to <b>Tachos,</b> named Nectanebes, whom he helped to gain the crown of Egypt, thus breaking his promises in a way which we are sorry should have been the last action of his long life. The next winter he embarked to return home, but he was driven by contrary winds to a place in Egypt called the port of Menelaus, because that king of Sparta had been so long weather-bound there. The storm had been too much for the tough old frame of Agesilaus, who died there. His body was embalmed in wax, and carried home to be buried at Sparta, whose greatest man he certainly was.|$|R

5000|$|Leucae (...) or Leuce (...) was a {{small town}} of ancient Ionia, in the {{neighbourhood}} of Phocaea. Leucae was situated, according to Pliny in promontorio quod insula fuit,or, [...] "on an island promontory." [...] From Scylax we learn {{that it was a}} place with harbours. According to Diodorus, the Persian admiral <b>Tachos</b> founded this town on an eminence on the sea coast, in 352 BCE; but shortly after, when <b>Tachos</b> had died, the Clazomenians and Cymaeans quarrelled about its possession, and the former succeeded by a stratagem in making themselves masters of it. At a later time Leucae became remarkable for the battle fought in its neighbourhood between the consul Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus and Aristonicus in 131 BCE. Some have supposed this place to be identical with the Leuconium mentioned by Thucydides; but this is impossible, as this latter place must be looked for in Chios. The site of the ancient Leucae is at Üçtepeler, Izmir Province, Turkey, some distance from the coast. [...] Coins were minted at Leucae in the 3rd century BCE.|$|R

5000|$|A {{tachometer}} (revolution-counter, tach, rev-counter, RPM gauge) is {{an instrument}} measuring the rotation {{speed of a}} shaft or disk, as in a motor or other machine. [...] The device usually displays the revolutions per minute (RPM) on a calibrated analogue dial, but digital displays are increasingly common. The word comes from Greek ταχος (<b>tachos</b> [...] "speed") and metron ("measure"). Essentially the words tachometer and speedometer have identical meaning: a device that measures speed. It is by arbitrary convention that in the automotive world one is used for engine {{and the other for}} vehicle speed. In formal engineering nomenclature, more precise terms are used to distinguish the two.|$|R
50|$|Abdashtart formed {{diplomatic}} {{alliances with}} Athens and Egypt. Relying on his increased fleet, by 360 or 359 he felt {{strong enough to}} revolt against the Persian Empire. Although the Persians were already fighting the Egyptians (whose Pharaoh <b>Tachos</b> had invaded Phoenicia), and although the rebels won two military victories against the generals of Artaxerxes III in 358 and 356, the revolt was suppressed in 355 and led to Persian occupation {{for the next four}} years, during which time the Sidonian currency was banned, minting privileges were stopped, and the Persian currency was forcibly introduced. The revolt has been described as 'a grave political error' for Abdashtart; not only did the Sidonians experience financial crisis and military repression, but they also lost swathes of territory to their neighbour, Tyre. The Persians left Abdashtart on the throne, and he proceeded to further diplomatic ties with Athens and Salamis, Cyprus, which had probably supported his revolt against Artaxerxes. Historians do not know whether he was the last of his dynasty, as it remains uncertain whether his known heir and successor, Tennes, was his son or some other close relative.|$|R
