5|$|The {{tradition}} of glassblowing {{continues in the}} 21st century in three factories located outside of the traditional quarter of the Old City, north of Hebron and south of the neighboring town of Halhul which generally produce functional household souvenirs. Two of <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> are owned by the Natsheh family. These are displayed in large halls close to each of <b>the</b> <b>factories.</b>|$|E
5|$|A two-seat {{conversion}} trainer, {{designated the}} I-5UTI (Uchebno-Trenirovochnyy Istrebitel—Fighter Trainer), {{was built by}} one of <b>the</b> <b>factories.</b> Only about twenty {{are believed to have}} been built. The cockpit was moved back and a second one inserted in front of it.|$|E
5|$|Although the Act {{was largely}} ineffective, {{it has been}} seen as the first piece of Health & Safety legislation, leading the way to {{subsequent}} regulations covering industrial workplaces; its requirement for factory walls to be whitewashed continued to be a legal requirement until <b>the</b> <b>Factories</b> Act 1961.|$|E
5000|$|The main article {{gives an}} {{overview}} of <b>the</b> state of <b>Factory</b> Act legislation in Edwardian Britain under <b>the</b> <b>Factory</b> and Workshop Acts 1878 to 1895 (the collective title of <b>the</b> <b>Factory</b> and Workshop Act 1878, <b>the</b> <b>Factory</b> and Workshop Act 1883, <b>the</b> Cotton Cloth <b>Factories</b> Act 1889, <b>the</b> <b>Factory</b> and Workshop Act 1891 and <b>the</b> <b>Factory</b> and Workshop Act 1895.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>factory</b> {{was one of}} <b>the</b> first <b>factories</b> to be {{designed}} on a factory 'Product Model' (part of <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> schema), and <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> provides a logical architectural view (and supporting runtime) for creating/modifying the work products of <b>the</b> <b>factory,</b> for <b>the</b> developer. This logical model separates the logical design of <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> product ‘Product Explorer’ from the physical implementation normally viewed and modified in ‘Solution Explorer’ of Visual Studio. In this way the physical structure of the solution artifacts could {{be separated from the}} logical architectural structure of the work products of <b>the</b> product. <b>The</b> <b>factory</b> user could now focus upon the architecture of the product, and author it using models and other abstractions, whilst <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> manages <b>the</b> creation, and placement of its source artifacts.|$|R
50|$|From 1979 to 1982 Mehmet Gümüşburun was the {{director}} of <b>the</b> <b>factory.</b> <b>The</b> current general director of <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> is Nihat Kılıç. As of July 2013, the annual production capacity of <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> was 2 million tonnes.|$|R
5|$|Despite its {{industrial}} background and <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> along its waterfront, {{the city has}} gained popularity for tourism in recent years, offering {{a wide variety of}} attractions and historic buildings in addition to its museums, churches and parks. See the religion section for details on churches.|$|E
5|$|Development {{was rushed}} {{and there were}} many defects in the LT vz. 35s. Many tanks had to be {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> to be repaired. Most of these repairs involved the electrical system, not the complicated pneumatic system.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} {{campaign}} in 1948, Ford visited voters at their doorsteps {{and as they}} left <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> where they worked. Ford also visited local farms where, in one instance, a wager resulted in Ford spending two weeks milking cows following his election victory.|$|E
50|$|In 1922, Keynsham was {{selected}} as the new location for Fry's chocolate <b>factory.</b> While digging <b>the</b> foundations for <b>the</b> <b>factory,</b> a second, smaller square Roman Villa was found, along with two stone coffins containing male and female skeletons. It was this discovery that captured popular interest, and led to the excavation of the cemetery site from 1922-24. Unfortunately, <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> builders did not desire to resit <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> foundations. Instead, <b>the</b> Roman villa was dug up and reassembled near the entrance to <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> site. <b>The</b> <b>factory</b> construction went on as planned, and the remainder of the second Roman villa is now buried under the foundations of <b>the</b> <b>factory.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> did construct a factory museum located in a lodge near the entrance of <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> grounds, which used to house Roman artifacts and the mosaics excavated from the cemetery site.|$|R
5000|$|From 1959 to 1978, <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> {{manufactured}} temperature-sensitive photoresistors 04-AN (in Cyrillic: 04-АН) {{for use in}} Soviet military rocket guidance systems. This brought <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> under <b>the</b> official {{military-industrial complex}} umbrella, and <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> was assigned a number [...] - [...] A-1381 [...] - [...] and the location reference was removed from <b>the</b> <b>factory's</b> name.|$|R
50|$|Sometime around 1902 to 1903 {{there was}} a large fire that {{destroyed}} <b>the</b> <b>factory.</b> <b>The</b> materials were well insured, so <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> was able to recover from this. At <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> had 27 employees and was a bustling business.|$|R
5|$|Aalborg is North Jutland's major {{industrial}} and commercial centre, exporting grain, cement, and spirits. Heavy industry {{was behind the}} city's prosperity until fairly recently. Many of <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> have now closed, {{to be replaced by}} developments in the knowledge-based and green-energy sectors. Mobile and wireless communications industries have grown substantially since the 1990s, as has rotor production for wind turbines.|$|E
5|$|Between 1870 and 1920, the {{population}} of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold. Many of the new residents were immigrants who sought employment in <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> and mills and introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city. Ethnic neighborhoods emerged on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side, Polish Hill, Bloomfield, and Squirrel Hill, home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households. The Strip District, the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, concerted {{efforts were}} made by the Luftwaffe to destroy the main {{manufacturing}} plants at Woolston and Itchen, near Southampton. The first bombing raid, which missed <b>the</b> <b>factories,</b> came on 23 August 1940. Over the next month, other raids were mounted until, on 26 September 1940, both factories were destroyed, with 92 people killed and a large number injured. Most of the casualties were experienced aircraft production workers.|$|E

He returned in 1977 and 1978 in <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> 935, and in 1979, when <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> was absent, {{with a private}} 935, while another private 935 won. He also supported <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> entries of Porsche 924 variants from 1980 to 1982.|$|R
5000|$|Seeds {{were sent}} ahead and about 300 {{acres of land}} were planted with sugar beets. [...] <b>The</b> <b>factory</b> began {{operating}} in February 1855. <b>The</b> finished <b>factory</b> used a water wheel in Parley’s Creek to power <b>the</b> <b>factory.</b> By <b>the</b> {{end of the summer}} in 1855, Brigham Young concluded <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> to be a failure and ordered it to be shut down. <b>The</b> <b>factory</b> could not produce sugar, and would only ever create molasses.|$|R
50|$|In Scoggins, Tethers is {{told that}} <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> was closed after an {{unidentified}} accident, and that <b>the</b> <b>factory's</b> foreman, Isaac Davner, hasn't been seen since. Further investigation is impossible because <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> is sealed by a complex lock requiring three keys.|$|R
5|$|Five major {{precision}} bombing {{attacks were}} conducted {{as part of}} the Empire Plan. On 9June, two groups of B-29s bombed an aircraft factory at Narao and another two groups raided a factory in Atsuta; both facilities were badly damaged. A single group of Superfortresses also attempted to bomb a Kawasaki Aircraft Industries factory at Akashi but accidentally struck a nearby village instead. The next day, XXIBomber Command bombers escorted by 107 P-51s successfully attacked six different factories in the Tokyo Bay region. Precision bombing raids were also conducted on 22June, when 382 B-29s attacked six targets at Kure, Kakamigahara, Himeji, Mizushima and Akashi in southern Honshu. Most of <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> targeted were badly damaged. Four days later, 510 B-29s escorted by 148 P-51s were sent against nine factories in southern Honshu and Shikoku. Heavy clouds over the region meant that many bombers attacked targets of opportunity individually or in small groups, and little damage was done to the raid's intended targets. Cloudy weather prevented any further large-scale precision attacks until 24July, when 625 B-29s were dispatched against seven targets near Nagoya and Osaka. Four of <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> attacked suffered heavy damage. Renewed cloudy weather prevented any further Empire Plan precision attacks in the last weeks of the war.|$|E
5|$|Initially Göth's {{plan was}} that all <b>the</b> <b>factories,</b> {{including}} Schindler's, should be moved inside the camp gates. However, Schindler, {{with a combination of}} diplomacy, flattery, and bribery, not only prevented his factory from being moved, but convinced Göth to allow him to build (at his own expense) a subcamp at Emalia to house his workers plus 450 Jews from other nearby factories. There they were safe from the threat of random execution, were well fed and housed, and were even permitted to undertake religious observances.|$|E
5|$|The Jägerstab {{was given}} {{extraordinary}} powers over labour, production and transportation resources, with its functions taking priority over housing repairs for bombed out civilians or restoration of vital city services. <b>The</b> <b>factories</b> that {{came under the}} Jägerstab program saw their work-weeks extended to 72 hours. At the same time, Milch took steps to rationalise production by {{reducing the number of}} variants of each type of aircraft produced.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{wallpaper}} <b>factory</b> resumed {{its work}} in 1923 as <b>the</b> only wallpaper <b>factory</b> in <b>the</b> USSR, {{and it was}} renamed <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> of Comintern. In the first year <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> produced 575,000 wallpaper rolls. In 1930, after <b>the</b> modernization, <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> released 6,000,000 wallpaper rolls per year. Tapestry and wallpaper roll manufacture in Ukraine began in Odessa, on the Karamyshevskaya street.|$|R
50|$|Dillon {{is home to}} {{the second}} largest yarn {{producing}} <b>factory</b> in <b>the</b> United States. In early 2007, Dillon Yarn Corporation sold <b>the</b> <b>factory,</b> and its textile division, was sold to yarn powerhouse Unifi. The other Dillon divisions continued to run in <b>the</b> <b>factory.</b> After Unifi shut <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> down, an affiliate of Dillon Yarn Corporation bought back <b>the</b> <b>factory,</b> keeping <b>the</b> existing Dillon divisions in place.|$|R
50|$|Between <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> and Veienmarka Road is Follumbyen, a {{residential}} {{area that was}} originally linked to <b>the</b> <b>factory.</b> On <b>the</b> side is another residential area, Begnamoen, with some connection to <b>the</b> <b>factory.</b> Follum school existed in the region from 1898 to 1965.|$|R
5|$|After {{four and}} a half months of {{research}} in Spain, Littleton visited the site of his war-time service in Naples. He was surprised to find seven small glass factories there. On a later visit to the island of Murano, he visited more than fifty glass factories. He was fascinated by the little demonstration furnaces that some of <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> placed outside their walls. The furnaces would be staffed by a couple of the factory's glassblowers, who would perform their craft for tourists. His meeting with Sala and his Murano experiences stimulated his interest in making glass art in a private studio.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Cogan was {{succeeded by}} Francis Day (1643–1644), Thomas Ivie (1644–1648) and Thomas Greenhill (1648–52 and 1655–58). At {{the end of}} Greenhill's term in 1652, Fort St George was {{elevated}} to a Presidency, independent of Bantam and {{under the leadership of}} the first president, Aaron Baker (1652–1655). However, in 1655 the status of the fort was downgraded to an Agency and made subject to the factory at Surat, until 1684. In 1658, control of all <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> in Bengal was given to Madras, when the English occupied the nearby village of Triplicane.|$|E
5|$|Aside from renovating <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> in Godegård (the largest {{ironworks}} in Östergötland) he {{also had}} an English park planned and built at his manor in Godergård. The park had an orangery, canals, bridges and pavilions and was modelled after the larger park at Drottningholm Palace with its Chinese Pavilion. The Godegård estate also included Mariedamm with the Trehörnings blast furnace and the De Geersfors manufacturing house. Grill also bought the Bona estate in Västra Ny, where he built a wrought iron factory and the Medevi seat farm in 1779, (sold the following year). In 1782, he bought the Flerohopp ironworks.|$|E
5000|$|The {{victims were}} all {{shot with a}} Hi-Point Model JHP [...]45-caliber pistol. Taylor was {{apparently}} shot by Higdon outside <b>the</b> <b>factory,</b> then four more workers in <b>the</b> <b>factory's</b> break room, and finally Hinojosa from behind on <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> floor. Higdon then committed suicide.|$|R
50|$|Acocks Green was the {{location}} for a custom-built factory which made parts for the Bristol Hercules radial engines. Construction of <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> commenced in late 1936 {{on the site}} of Westwood's market gardening business near <b>the</b> canal. <b>The</b> <b>factory</b> was <b>the</b> Rover shadow <b>factory</b> and it was operational by July 1937. Towards the end of the war, <b>the</b> Rover <b>factory</b> began to produce Meteor tank engines, and the Meteorite engine. <b>The</b> <b>factory</b> was visited by King George VI in March 1938. The military connection <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> had made Acocks Green a target for German bombers.|$|R
5000|$|The first vehicle <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> {{produced}} was <b>the</b> Honda Odyssey in 2001. [...] In 2004 the Honda Pilot {{was added}} {{as the second}} vehicle <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> was producing. [...] In 2009 <b>the</b> Alabama <b>factory</b> picked up production of the Honda Ridgeline. [...] Between 2009-2010 <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> produced <b>the</b> v6 model of the Honda Accord, but all production of the Accord has since {{moved back to the}} Marysville Auto Plant. In 2013 <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> began production of the 2014 Acura MDX.|$|R
5|$|By 1821, Stratford {{was served}} {{by a number of}} wharves, some located on the Lea and others on the Channelsea River or other branches. In {{addition}} to wharves for general goods, some specifically handled timber, chalk, stone, coal, or wheat. Several of <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> and mills had private wharves. By this date, a dock had been built near Bow Bridge to the south of the High Street. It was about , and was connected to the river by its own channel. It was initially called Stratford Dock, later becoming Meggs Dock and was probably constructed by the Middlesex and Essex Turnpike Trust. Half of it had been filled in by 1896, and the rest by 1920.|$|E
5|$|Denied {{the use of}} compulsion, Chamberlain had {{to persuade}} Britons to {{volunteer}} for essential war work, and fit young workers to leave <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> and enter the Army. He had to address mass meetings and issue posters. He found that workers were reluctant to exchange {{the comforts of home}} and wartime salaries for the uncertainties of the trenches and a wage of one shilling a day. Chamberlain had little confidence in voluntary schemes and they indeed proved unsuccessful, with only 9,000workers freed to be drafted into the Army at a time when Britain was sustaining huge casualties.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} weeks of World War II, {{warships}} of the United States Navy, the British Royal Navy, and the Royal New Zealand Navy bombarded industrial and military facilities in Japan. Most of these bombardments involved battleships and cruisers which caused heavy damage to several of <b>the</b> <b>factories</b> targeted, as well as nearby civilian areas. A major goal of the attacks was to provoke the Japanese military into committing some of its reserve force of aircraft into battle. However, the Japanese {{did not attempt to}} attack the Allied bombardment forces, and none of the involved warships suffered any damage.|$|E
50|$|The {{atmosphere}} workers experienced whilst {{working at}} <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> {{can be considered}} pleasant. The workers of <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> were like a family and the days were filled with laughter and singing. <b>The</b> <b>factory</b> itself {{was more than a}} place to work. It had a number of sports teams and events and the Christmas parties held, not only for staff but for local children, gave <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> a real sense of community.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant was}} {{established}} in 1914 as <b>the</b> Tsaritsyn Weapons <b>Factory,</b> and renamed Red Barricades after the Russian Revolution. It was for a time <b>the</b> largest munition <b>factory</b> in Europe. Titan had its origins as <b>the</b> <b>factory's</b> design bureau. <b>The</b> <b>factory</b> was overran during Operation Barbarossa, but resumed production in 1944. The Titan Design Bureau was separated from <b>the</b> <b>factory</b> in 1990.|$|R
