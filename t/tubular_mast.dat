50|$|During the anti-Nazi Slovak National Uprising, the {{partisan}} group Jánošík had their shelters below {{the top of}} the mountain. In 1960, a TV transmitter with a 137.5 metres tall guyed <b>tubular</b> <b>mast</b> was built on the top. There is also a weather station and a station of the mountain rescue service.|$|E
50|$|In 1957 {{the wooden}} radio tower was {{replaced}} by a 216 metres tall guyed <b>tubular</b> <b>mast,</b> which was insulated against ground as it was not able to carry the antenna for TV broadcasting on its top. As this mast was also used for mediumwave broadcasting, it was insulated against ground.|$|E
50|$|In {{the former}} Soviet Union, guyed <b>tubular</b> <b>masts</b> for {{broadcasting}} without these crossbars were also built. However such masts are not something special as such structures also exist in Germany, Czech, Slovakia, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Austria, Sweden, Slovenia and Poland.|$|R
5000|$|... 30107 KM is the {{designation}} of Russian-built guyed <b>tubular</b> <b>masts</b> for FM-/TV-broadcasting, which {{were built in the}} first half of the 1960s at different places in Russia and Ukraine. The 30107 KM-mast has normally a 151 or 182.5 metres high mast body with a wall diameter of 16 - 10 mm, and exists in versions guyed in three and four directions.|$|R
5000|$|Most mast {{radiators}} {{are built}} as guyed masts {{insulated from the}} ground at the base. Steel lattice masts of triangular cross-section are the most common type. Square lattice <b>masts</b> and <b>tubular</b> <b>masts</b> are also sometimes used. To ensure that the tower is a continuous conductor, the tower's structural sections are electrically bonded at the joints by short copper jumpers which are soldered to each side.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, a 65 metres tall guyed <b>tubular</b> <b>mast</b> {{radiator}} {{was built}} in Vilseck at 49°38'40"N, 11°47'1"E for broadcasting the program of AFN Powernet on 1107 kHz with 10 kW for the area of Grafenwöhr and Vilseck. It replaced the old transmitter at Grafenwöhr, which was not usable any more for electromagnetic compatibility reasons.|$|E
50|$|The Waltham {{transmitting}} station is a broadcasting and telecommunications facilityat Waltham-on-the-Wolds, 5 miles (8 km) north-east of Melton Mowbray. It sits inside the Waltham civil parish near Stonesby, {{in the district}} of Melton, Leicestershire, UK. It has a 315 m guyed steel <b>tubular</b> <b>mast.</b> The main structure height {{to the top of the}} steelwork is 290.8 metres (954 ft), with the UHF television antennas contained within a GRP shroud mounted on top.|$|E
50|$|The Bilsdale {{transmitting}} station is a broadcasting and telecommunications facility, located at Bilsdale West Moor above Bilsdale, close to Helmsley, North Yorkshire, England. It includes a guyed steel <b>tubular</b> <b>mast</b> that is primarily used for {{radio and television}} transmission. The height of the mast is 314 m to the pinnacle. It {{is among the most}} powerful in the UK at 500 kW ERP and has recently been equipped with new aircraft warning lights, in the form of arrays of ultra bright red LEDs.|$|E

5000|$|Shushi-Wan Omega Transmitter (station H) {{situated}} near Shushi-Wan on Tsushima Island at [...] used as its antenna a 389-metre tall <b>tubular</b> steel <b>mast,</b> insulated against ground. This mast, {{which was}} built in 1973 and which was the tallest structure in Japan (and perhaps the tallest <b>tubular</b> steel <b>mast</b> ever built) was dismantled in 1998 by crane. On its former site, an approximately 8 metre-tall memorial consisting of the mast base (without the insulator) and a segment was built. On {{the site of the}} former helix building there is now a playground.|$|R
5000|$|Pesochnaya TV Mast (195-m tall guyed <b>tubular</b> steel <b>mast</b> {{built in}} 1962, which is {{equipped}} with 6 crossbars running in 2 levels from the mast structure to the guys) ...|$|R
50|$|Zendstation Smilde {{is a tall}} {{partially}} {{guyed tower}} in Hoogersmilde, the Netherlands, built in 1959, for directional radio services and TV and FM-transmissions. The structure {{is similar to the}} Gerbrandy Tower (IJsselstein), and consists of an 80 metre high reinforced concrete tower and, until a fire accident on July 15, 2011, had a guyed <b>tubular</b> <b>mast</b> mounted on top. When first built, the tower, including the mast, was 270 metres high. The addition of a further section (analog TV - UHF antenna) to the mast increased its total height to 303.5 m (996 ft).In September 2007 the analog TV - UHF antenna was removed and replaced by a new UHF antenna for DVB-T, reducing the tower's height to 294 m (965 ft). After rebuilding the collapsed tower in 2012, the new height is 303 metres.|$|E
50|$|Suchá Hora {{transmitter}} is {{a facility}} for FM- and TV-transmission on 1,231.6 metres high mountain Skalka (Kremnica Mountains) near Banská Bystrica in Slovakia. Suchá Hora transmitter uses as antenna mast a 312 metres tall guyed <b>tubular</b> <b>mast,</b> {{which is one}} of the tallest structure of Slovakia and one of the highest elevated supertall structures in Europe.The mast of Suchá Hora transmitter was built in 1960. The transmitter went on service on October 28, 1960. In 1961 a storm blasted the roof of the transmitter building away and in 1962 the 7 ton weighing TV broadcasting antenna, which was covered with ice, fell from 300 metres height to the ground and impacted close to the transmitter building. Close to the tower, there is a small free-standing telecommunication tower built of steel.|$|E
50|$|Emley Moor {{has been}} a {{transmission}} site since {{the earliest days of}} television. The first permanent transmitter built there was for ITV, covering much of the north of England. It had a 135 m lattice tower, which provided limited coverage. Its performance was improved in anticipation of colour PAL transmissions in 1966, when a 385 m guy-supported <b>tubular</b> <b>mast</b> was erected. It was constructed from curved steel segments to form a 2.75 m diameter tube, 275 m long, and was surmounted by a lattice section 107 m tall, and a capping cylinder, bringing the total height to 386 m. At the time of its construction, {{it was one of the}} tallest man-made structures in the world. It was designed by British Insulated Callender's Cables (BICC), and manufactured by EMI, and built by J. L. Eve Construction.|$|E
50|$|It has a guyed <b>tubular</b> steel <b>mast,</b> with a lattice upper section. The mast was {{shortened}} in April 2010 {{and is now}} 1154 ft in height. Before this it was 1272 ft {{high and}} {{was considered to be}} the tallest structure {{of its kind in the}} world (taller masts, such as the KVLY-TV mast in the United States, use steel lattice construction), the tallest structure of any type in the United Kingdom and also the tallest structure within the European Union. After the top section was removed, the mast's reduced height relegated it to 14th-highest structure in the EU and second-highest in the UK after Skelton. The current world's tallest guyed <b>tubular</b> steel <b>mast</b> is TV Tower Vinnytsia in Ukraine.|$|R
50|$|In October 1973 Mi Amigos 180 ft lattice {{antenna mast}} (itself a {{replacement}} for the <b>tubular</b> steel <b>mast</b> that had collapsed a year earlier) fell into the sea during a storm. Caroline's engineers rigged up a temporary horizontal wire antenna but this could only achieve very limited coverage.|$|R
50|$|Near Bad Marienberg, T-Systems runs a {{transmitter}} for VHF {{and television}} {{which has a}} 174-m-high freestanding <b>tubular</b> steel <b>mast.</b> Südwestrundfunk (SWR) sends all four of its radio programmes from here. In the summer of 2008, the switchover from analogue TV transmissions to DVB-T is to be carried out.|$|R
5000|$|Roosevelt was {{the first}} of her class to undergo the SCB-110 reconstruction, at a cost of $48 million. She {{received}} an enclosed [...] "hurricane bow," [...] one C-11-2 and two C-11-1 steam catapults, strengthened arresting gear, an enlarged bridge, a mirror landing system, and a 482 ft angled flight deck. SPS-8 height finding radar and SPS-12 air search radar were mounted on a new <b>tubular</b> <b>mast.</b> The aft elevator was relocated to the starboard deck edge, the forward elevator was enlarged, and all elevators were uprated to 75,000 lb capacity. Aviation fuel bunkerage was increased from 350,000 to 450,000 gallons (1,320,000 to 1,700,000 L). Standard displacement rose to 51,000 tons, while deep load displacement rose to 63,400 tons. As weight compensation, several of the 5 in Mark 16 anti-aircraft guns were landed, leaving only 10, and the 3,200-ton armor belt was removed. Hull blisters were also added to cope with the increased weight. Roosevelt recommissioned on 6 April 1956.|$|E
50|$|Another {{remarkable}} {{structure is}} the Arkhangelsk TV Mast, a 151 m tall guyed mast for FM-/TV-broadcasting built in 1964. This <b>tubular</b> steel <b>mast</b> has six crossbars equipped with gangways, which run in two levels from the mast structure to the crossbars. On these crossbars {{there are also}} several antennas installed (image).|$|R
5000|$|Dubnik {{transmitter}} is {{a facility}} for FM-/TV-broadcasting near Dubnik in Slovakia at 21°27'45" [...] E 48°55'26" [...] N.It uses as antenna tower a guyed <b>tubular</b> steel <b>mast,</b> {{which is similar}} to that of Suchá Hora transmitter and 318 metres tall and one of the tallest towers in Slovakia. Close to the mast, there is an architectonically interesting telecommunication tower.|$|R
50|$|Guyed masts are {{sometimes}} also constructed out of steel tubes. This construction type {{has the advantage}} that cables and other components can be protected from weather inside the tube and consequently the structure may look cleaner.These masts are mainly used for FM-/TV-broadcasting, but sometimes also as mast radiator. The big mast of Mühlacker transmitting station {{is a good example}} of this. A disadvantage of this mast type is that it is much more affected by winds than masts with open bodies. Several <b>tubular</b> guyed <b>masts</b> have collapsed. In the UK, the Emley Moor and Waltham TV stations masts collapsed in the 1960s. In Germany the Bielstein transmitter collapsed in 1985.Tubular masts were not built in all countries. In Germany, France, UK, Czech, Slovakia, Japan and the former Soviet Union, many <b>tubular</b> guyed <b>masts</b> were built, while there are nearly none in Poland or North America.|$|R
5000|$|Veselovka TV Mast ( [...] Russian: РТПЦ Веселовка) is a 151 m tall guyed <b>tubular</b> steel <b>mast</b> for FM- and TV-transmission near Veselovka in Kaliningrad Oblast at Russia. Veselovka TV Mast {{was built}} in 1965 and is from the {{somewhat}} unusual structural type 30107 KM. It is equipped with six crossbars equipped with gangways, which run in two levels from the mast structure to the guys.|$|R
50|$|In {{several cities}} in Russia and Ukraine several <b>tubular</b> guyed <b>masts</b> with {{crossbars}} {{running from the}} mast structure to the guys {{were built in the}} 1960s. All these masts, which are designed as 30107 KM, are exclusively used for FM and TV transmission and, except for the mast in Vinnytsia, are between 150 and 200 metres tall.The crossbars of these masts are equipped with a gangway that holds smaller antennas, though their main purpose is oscillation damping.|$|R
50|$|Large {{sections}} of the city dating from the 1960s have been either demolished and re-developed or modernised {{with the use of}} beton and steel. Old flats have been converted into modern apartments, 9 microdistricts of 17 and 9-floor panelák apartments have since been developed. Kryvyi Rih TV Mast is a 185m tall guyed <b>tubular</b> steel <b>mast</b> built in 1960, which carries in 2 levels 3 crossbars, which run from the mast structure to the guys. All three crossbars are equipped with gangways that carry additional smaller antennas.|$|R
50|$|The station's antenna was a {{vertical}} guyed <b>tubular</b> steel <b>mast</b> aft of the bridge. (Radio London's publicity claimed the mast was 212 feet (64.6 metres) high, {{but a recent}} estimate from photographs, puts it at only 170 feet (about 52 metres), approximately. http://www.hansknot.com/2007-10b.htm). The positioning of the antenna was at the ship's center of gravity. This was critical, as no cement ballast {{was used in the}} ship's base to counteract the sway caused by such a tall and heavy mast on a floating vessel.|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} standard IEC 61400 - 12 - 1 “Wind turbines – Part 12 - 1 : Power performance measurements of electricity producing wind turbines” aims {{to provide a}} uniform methodology that will ensure consistency, accuracy and reproducibility in the measurement and analysis of power performance by wind turbines [1]. Annex G of this standard provides a methodology for the appropriate arrangement of instruments on the meteorological mast to ensure accurate measurement. For cup anemometers it provides recommendations about their location relative to the mast so {{that the effect of}} mast and boom interference on their output may be minimised. These recommendations are given for both <b>tubular</b> <b>masts</b> and lattice masts. This paper compares the flow distortion predicted by the IEC standard and the results of a 3 D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of a triangular lattice mast. Based on the results of wind tunnel and CFD simulation {{it was found that the}} flow distortion surrounding the lattice mast was over predicted by the method suggested in appendix G of IEC 61400 - 12 - 1. Using the CFD data it was possible to determine, for a range of flow directions and mast heights, the distance from the mast that anemometers would need to be in order to be outside the flow distortion field...|$|R
40|$|Tapered <b>tubular</b> steel <b>masts</b> are {{commonly}} used to support floodlights {{in a range of}} applications. The design of these slender tapered masts requires a rational elastic flexural buckling analysis as the thickness also varies with height. Therefore a series of finite element analyses of tapered masts with varying geometry parameters was conducted to develop an elastic flexural buckling load formula. This paper briefly discusses the design methods, and then presents the details of the finite element analyses and the results. 1 –Associate Professor of Civil Engineering, and Director, Physical Infrastructure Centre 2 –Former BE (Civil) Student, QU...|$|R
50|$|The {{base was}} {{established}} in 1956 as a British research station primarily for survey, geology and meteorology and {{to contribute to the}} IGY in 1957. It consists of a hut and associated structures and outbuildings, including a small emergency storage building, bitch and pup pens, anemometer tower, and two <b>tubular</b> steel radio <b>masts.</b> As a relatively unaltered research station of the late 1950s, it provides a reminder of the science and living conditions that existed when the Antarctic Treaty was first signed in 1959.|$|R
50|$|The {{city has}} {{a large number of}} {{buildings}} remaining from the 17th and 18th centuries; however, many parts of the town are dominated by Soviet era apartment blocks, dating mainly from the 1960s, similar to other provincial towns which expanded rapidly due to fast industrialization. These buildings are nearing the end of their service life and are in need of serious repair and, in many cases, replacement. Industrial enterprises are mainly located {{to the north of the}} town center. The eastern part of Saransk, located east of the Insar River, is Posop. An interesting detail is the Soviet era military base, belonging to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, which is located along the railway lines and serves of a time when Saransk was, effectively, a closed city. Another city landmark is the Saransk TV Tower — a 180-meter-tall guyed <b>tubular</b> steel <b>mast</b> built in 1961.|$|R
5000|$|The terms [...] "mast" [...] and [...] "tower" [...] {{are often}} used interchangeably. However, in {{structural}} engineering terms, a tower is a self-supporting or cantilevered structure, while a mast is held up by stays or guys. Broadcast engineers in the UK use the same terminology. A mast is a ground-based or rooftop structure that supports antennas at a height where they can satisfactorily send or receive radio waves. Typical masts are of steel lattice or <b>tubular</b> steel construction. <b>Masts</b> themselves play no part in the transmission of mobile telecommunications.Masts (to use the civil engineering terminology) tend to be cheaper to build but require an extended area surrounding them to accommodate the guy wires. Towers are more commonly used in cities where land is in short supply.|$|R
50|$|A {{contract}} for the erection of the <b>tubular</b> steel aerial <b>mast,</b> {{which was to be}} 218 feet in height was entered into in January 1939 while tenders were called for other buildings to be built. It was intended the mast would be finished in six weeks and the station would be on air by Easter 1939. The erection of the mast which had been extended to 228 feet in height was a disaster. A pulley failed causing the newly constructed mast to buckle and fall. It was extensively damaged. A new mast had to be commissioned which took two to three weeks to build. In the end the two contractors commissioned to erect the mast were unable to do so. The Mayor of Lithgow Bob Fullagar, who was Manager of the Lithgow State Mine at the time, took over the job and had the mast installed.|$|R
