5|$|Beyond Julian Park, it {{has been}} conjectured <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> {{originally}} continued to the Roman garrison fort at Lease Rigg, south west of Sleights, based on reports from antiquarians in {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries that fragments were visible at numerous points along this course. Hayes and Rutter appear confident of the structure's extent as far as Lease Rigg, but admit that its extent is conjectural from well short of that point, from Dowson Garth Quarry northwards.|$|E
5|$|Lander argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of {{the work}} is itself symbolic. As well as the {{division}} of the poem into 23 parts, each signifying and describing one day of Donne's illness, each part is itself split in three – representing the Trinity. The use of three elements – Meditation, Expostulation, and Prayer – also matches the three services found in the Book of Common Prayer, a common influence on devotional writers of Donne's era.|$|E
5|$|Lissitzky, {{aware of}} severe {{mismatch}} between his {{ideas and the}} existing urban landscape, experimented with different configurations of the horizontal surface and height-to-width ratios so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> appeared balanced visually ("spatial balance is in the contrast of vertical and horizontal tensions"). The raised platform was shaped {{in a way that}} each of its four facets looked distinctly different. Each tower faced the Kremlin with the same facet, providing a pointing arrow to pedestrians on the streets. All eight buildings were planned identically, so Lissitzky proposed color-coding them for easier orientation.|$|E

5000|$|Peter Eekhout is an {{archaeologist}} who studied and excavated {{the site of}} Pachacamac. According to Eekhout, [...] "For decades most scholars thought the pyramids (from the second section) were religious [...] "embassies" [...] that housed delegations from far-off communities who came to worship, bring tribute, and make offerings to Pachacamac".

5|$|A {{cold front}} was located {{north of the}} Bahamas on August26, with a broad area of {{cyclonic}} turning located east of northern Florida. Atmospheric pressures were falling in the region, and gale force winds were recorded by 12:00UTC on August27. Based on the structure, {{it is estimated that}} the frontal low developed into a tropical storm by 18:00UTC that day. Ship reports in the region suggested peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). There was very dry air {{on the west side of}} the system, unusual for August, and the radius of maximum winds was around 115mi (185km), suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> could have been akin to a subtropical cyclone. The storm continued to the northwest, making landfall very near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina at 02:00UTC on August28. It spread rainfall across the Carolinas, later enhanced by Hurricane Able just days later, while cities reported winds of around 35mph (55km/h). The storm weakened over land and dissipated late on August28 over eastern Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|A monstrous, mutated Fifield {{returns to}} the Prometheus and kills several crew members before he is killed. The Prometheus captain, Janek, speculates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> was an Engineer {{military}} base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon, the dark liquid. He also determines <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> houses a spacecraft. Weyland and a team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and speaks to him {{in an attempt to}} explain what Weyland wants. The Engineer responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw flees and warns Janek that the Engineer is planning to release the liquid on Earth, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the Prometheus into the alien craft, ejecting the lifeboat in the process, while Vickers flees in an escape pod. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground, killing Vickers. Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds her alien offspring is alive and has grown to gigantic size. David's still-active head warns Shaw that the Engineer is pursuing her. The Engineer forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto the Engineer; it thrusts an ovipositor down the Engineer's throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains, and with his help, launches another Engineer spacecraft. She intends to reach the Engineers' homeworld in an attempt to understand why they wanted to destroy humanity.|$|E

This paper presents a comparison study on the structural properties of monopile and tripod wind-turbine support structures, which are used extensively in offshore wind farms. Both <b>structures</b> have <b>the</b> same upper tower, but different lower structures, one with a monopile and the other with a tripod. Static, fatigue, and modal analyses indicate <b>that</b> both <b>the</b> tripod and monopile structures are feasible in <b>the</b> field, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tripod <b>structure</b> is superior to <b>the</b> monopile <b>structure.</b> Static analysis reveals <b>that</b> <b>the</b> location of maximum stress in <b>the</b> monopile <b>structure</b> is different from <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> tripod <b>structure,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tripod <b>structure</b> shows higher stiffness and greater stress-control capacity than <b>the</b> monopile <b>structure.</b> Fatigue analysis indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tripod <b>structure</b> has a longer lifetime than <b>the</b> monopile <b>structure.</b> Modal analysis indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two <b>structures</b> exhibit large differences in their natural frequencies.

5|$|Henry died in 1542 and his son, Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland, {{inherited}} the family estates. During the Rising of the North, in which Catholic magnates rebelled against ElizabethI, Henry remained {{loyal to the}} Tudor dynasty despite the Cliffords being a Catholic family. He dismantled Appleby Castle {{to prevent it from}} being used against royal forces, {{and at the same time}} put Brougham at the service of the Elizabethan government, although there was no fighting at the castle. Under the second and third earls, Henry and George, the castle was still used as a residence, with the third earl being born at Brougham Castle. However, it was under George that the building began to decay and by 1592 it was deserted. George Clifford spent much time either in southern England in his role as Queen's Champion or at Skipton. An inventory of the castle's contents in 1595 demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> was a neglected, meagrely furnished place, and what little furniture there was old and in disrepair.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{a remnant}} of the {{earliest}} known bridge-like structure in London was discovered alongside Vauxhall Bridge, when shifting currents washed away a layer of silt which had covered it. Dating to between 1550BC and 300BC, it consists of two rows of wooden posts, which it is believed would originally have carried a deck of some kind. It is believed {{that it did not}} cross the whole river, but instead connected the south bank to an island, possibly used for burial of the dead. As no mention of this or similar structures in the area is made in Julius Caesar's account of crossing the Thames nor by any other Roman author, it is presumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> had been dismantled or destroyed prior to Caesar's expedition to Britain in 55BC.

5|$|The Students' Building was {{designed}} by the New York City architecture firm of McKim, Mead & White, representing their only project at Vassar College. The plans were drawn up by young architect Joseph Herenden Clark, a recent graduate of the Columbia School of Architecture who, upon hearing the requirement <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> be made from brick with white trim and a slate roof, recalled Christ Church in Alexandria, Virginia. Clark had studied Christ Church, which George Washington attended, during his days at Columbia. He trekked to Alexandria to study the interior and exterior {{of the church and}} ultimately the designs for the Students' Building, his first public plan, were inspired by its architecture and features. Bishop and Company were contracted to construct the Students' Building, an example of the Southern colonial revival style. It sits on the north edge of campus due south of the college's North Gate and southeast of residential quad dorms like Lathrop House. Noyes House was built in 1958 and rests immediately to the southeast of the Students' Building.|$|E

As well as producing a visual record of the castle from which elevations and plans could be derived, it identified features within the castle which could be buildings which no longer survive. In 2016 the University of Central Lancashire undertook a geophysical survey, using it as training for archaeology students and volunteers.

5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically as Secotium texense by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1873, based on specimens sent {{to them from}} western Texas. George Edward Massee transferred it to the genus Gyrophragmium in 1891, because of its resemblance to the species Gyrophragmium delilei, and because he felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> of the volva {{as well as the}} internal morphology of the gleba excluded it from Secotium. In 1916, William Murrill listed the species in Gymnopus, but did not explain the reason for the generic transfer. In a 1943 publication, Sanford Zeller compared a number of similar secotioid genera: Galeropsis, Gyrophragmium and Montagnea. He concluded that the species did not fit in the limits set for the genus Gyrophragmium and so created the new genus Longia with Longia texensis as the type species. The generic name was to honor William Henry Long, an American mycologist noted for his work in describing Gasteromycetes. Zeller also mentioned two additional synonyms: Secotium decipiens (Peck, 1895), and Podaxon strobilaceous (Copeland, 1904).|$|E
