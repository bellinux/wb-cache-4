40|$|Due {{to higher}} demand of {{petroleum}} and petroleum based synthetic rubbers, {{the price of}} Ribbed Smoked Sheets (RSS) has been gone up. Therefore, local rubber industries, particularly re-treading tyre industry has started replacing RSS grade partly with a cheaper scrap grade of Natural Rubber (NR) in their re-treading tyre compounds, in arbitrary ratios without considering <b>the</b> quality of <b>tyre</b> treads. In <b>the</b> project work, <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>re-treading</b> compounds based on blends of (RSS) and scrap grade in different proportions are investigated to identify the most suitable blend for obtaining optimum technical properties. The first step of the study reveals that the blend having RSS and scrap rubber in the ratio 80 : 20 is the most suitable economical blend to obtain a balance of technical properties. To get the optimum technical properties of <b>the</b> <b>re-treading</b> <b>tyre</b> compounds, <b>the</b> amount of carbon black should be added separately into {{the two types of}} rubber and prepared in the form of master batches, prior to mixing the two types of rubber together.

The model includes a representation of <b>the</b> <b>tyre,</b> a steel wheel and a surface. <b>The</b> <b>tyre</b> is represented in detail {{by a number of}} <b>tyre</b> components, <b>the</b> wheel and surface are coarsely modelled. LS-DYNA 3 D is used to simulate the inflation of <b>the</b> <b>tyre,</b> <b>the</b> fit between <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> and <b>the</b> wheel and the vertical loading of <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> against <b>the</b> surface. Simulation results, such as the load-deflection characteristics and the load-tyre/ground contact patch dimensions are compared with mixed success to those obtained experimentally. The stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> components and <b>the</b> inflation pressure are varied independently and the simulation is repeated. The resulting load-tyre/ground contact patch dimensions are discussed in context with the development of a rolling tyre model.

40|$|For vehicle at normal driving {{conditions}} and speeds above 30 - 40 km/h the dominating external noise source {{is the sound}} generated by <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> and road interaction. Previous measurements have shown {{that there is a}} strong correlation between the radiated sound pressure and the vibrations of <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> structure for frequency below approximately 1 kHz. <b>The</b> <b>tyre</b> vibration is also the main source of noise inside many vehicles in this frequency range. It is thus important to develop simple tools that predict <b>the</b> <b>tyres</b> behaviour in this frequency range. <b>The</b> <b>tyre</b> is modelled as an elemental system, which permits the analysis of <b>the</b> low frequency <b>tyre</b> response when excited by distributed stochastic forces in the contact patch. Although the contact mechanism is generally non-linear, it is assumed here that <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> is compliant enough for the whole of the contact patch to remain of the same width and to be always in touch with the road. A linear model can then be used to calculate the contact forces from the road roughness and thus calculate the resulting radial velocity of <b>the</b> <b>tyre.</b> A spectral density matrix, derived from a road roughness model, describes the velocities and is used to calculate the expectation of <b>the</b> <b>tyre’s</b> kinetic energy and its sound power radiation. In the first instance a simple two-dimensional model will be used with a Winkler bedding model of the contact patch to predict the power spectral density of <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> vibration at different road speeds. This model {{can also be used to}} provide an initial estimate of the potential effect of various active control strategies for reducing <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> vibrations.
