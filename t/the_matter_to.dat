5|$|In late 1986, {{questions}} were asked in the UK Parliament concerning the matters in Lobster. Then Labour Party Member of Parliament for Hull North, Kevin McNamara, brought up {{the issue in the}} House of Commons, asking the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, to refer <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> the Security Commission, and asking then Attorney-General and Conservative MP Michael Havers, to ask the Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate allegations published in Lobster and prosecute Colin Wallace for revealing details of secret service operations against Her Majesty's Government. Both declined. Two weeks later, Labour MP Tam Dalyell asked the Prime Minister why she would not refer <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> the Security Commission, but she said that she had nothing more to add.|$|E
5|$|The new ACC commander, General Corley, {{referred}} <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> USAF Lieutenant General Norman Seip, {{commander of}} the 12th Air Force, as a court-martial convening authority to determine if additional charges or actions would be taken against any of the personnel involved in the incident. Seip later closed the investigation without recommending criminal charges against anyone involved.|$|E
5|$|A person {{inside or}} outside a {{security}} area who knows or has reasonable cause to believe that another person has committed an offence under Part III of the ISA, or has information about the present or intended movements or whereabouts of another person whom he or she knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be a terrorist, but who fails to report <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> a police officer, commits an offence punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years. However, if the person voluntarily gives full information to a police officer before being accused of or charged with an offence, {{he or she will}} not be convicted.|$|E

5|$|According to the players, {{they refused}} to divulge more {{strategic}} material, such as team tactics and player selection policies. One of the most publicised {{of a series of}} betting controversies in cricket in the 1990s, the matter was initially covered up by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB), which decided that it was sufficient to privately fine the players. The ACB concluded that, since Waugh and Warne had previously accused Pakistani cricket captain Saleem Malik of attempting to bribe them to lose matches, their credibility as witnesses would be damaged if their own involvement with John was publicised. The ACB reported <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> the International Cricket Council, and there the matter ended.|$|E
5|$|American {{journalist}} H. R. Knickerbocker, who had met both Hitler and Hess, {{speculated that}} Hitler had sent Hess {{to deliver a}} message informing Winston Churchill of the forthcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, and offering a negotiated peace or even an anti-Bolshevik partnership. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin believed that Hess's flight had been engineered by the British. Stalin persisted in this belief as late as 1944, when he mentioned <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> Churchill, who insisted {{that they had no}} advance knowledge of the flight.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Government's unequivocal {{view that}} the right to vote is an implied {{constitutional}} right, in Singapore it is the courts that ultimately determine the meaning of the Constitution. Thio Li-ann has suggested that since the right's status {{is not likely to be}} brought before the courts in a dispute, the Cabinet should refer <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution for an authoritative opinion.|$|E

5|$|In April 1943, the Polish government-in-exile led by Sikorski {{insisted on}} {{bringing}} <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> the negotiation {{table with the}} Soviets and on opening {{an investigation by the}} International Red Cross. Stalin, in response, accused the Polish government of collaborating with Nazi Germany and broke off diplomatic relations with it. The Soviet Union also started a campaign to get the Western Allies to recognize the pro-Soviet government-in-exile of the Union of Polish Patriots led by Wanda Wasilewska. Sikorski died in an air crash in July—an event that was convenient for the Allied leaders.|$|E
5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> be decided {{according}} to the subjective discretion of the Minister. The only explanation given for deregistration was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service was contrary to the public interest. The Court did not require the executive to elaborate on exactly how a failure to perform national service would be contrary to public interest. It accepted the executive's discretion to derogate a fundamental right without a close scrutiny of the executive's rationale and explanations.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to stop Slobodan Milošević's Serbian-led {{crackdown}} on KLA separatists and Albanian civilians in Kosovo, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1199 on 23September 1998 to demand a ceasefire. Negotiations under US Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke broke down on 23March 1999, and he handed <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> NATO, which started a 78-day bombing campaign on 24March 1999. Operation Allied Force targeted the military capabilities of {{what was then the}} Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During the crisis, NATO also deployed one of its international reaction forces, the ACE Mobile Force (Land), to Albania as the Albania Force (AFOR), to deliver humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo.|$|E

5|$|Livingstone's {{relationship}} with Kate Allen ended in November 2001, although they remained friends. He then started a {{relationship with}} Emma Beal, together having two children, Thomas (born December 2002) and Mia (born March 2004). At a May 2002 party in Tufnell Park, Livingstone got into an argument with Beal's friend Robin Hedges, {{a reporter for the}} Evening Standard. Hedges subsequently fell off of a wall, bruised his ribs and ended up in hospital; the press claimed that Livingstone had pushed him, although he insisted that he did not. Liberal Democrats on the London Assembly referred <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> the Standards Board for England, who ruled that there was no evidence for any wrongdoing on Livingstone's behalf.|$|E
5|$|On 13 January, Brown {{received}} {{a request from}} the Naval Ordnance Laboratory for the Missouri to proceed through a channel in which the United States Navy had strewn acoustic cables {{as part of an}} ongoing project that aimed to identify ships by their propeller signatures. The request was entirely optional, but as the captain was preoccupied with the details of the upcoming sortie to Cuba he gave the letter little attention and instead referred <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> his operations officer, Commander John R. Millett, who in turn referred the letter to the ship's navigator, Lieutenant Commander Frank G. Morris.|$|E
5|$|On January 13, 1855, the Oregon Territorial Legislature {{passed a}} bill moving the seat of {{government}} from Salem to Corvallis. Governor George Law Curry and many others objected to the move, since public buildings in Salem were already under construction. Curry sent <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> the Secretary of the Treasury in Washington, D.C., where Secretary James Guthrie declared the move invalid unless acted on by the United States Congress. Thereafter, Curry and Oregon Secretary of State Benjamin Harding moved back to Salem.|$|E

5|$|Randall spent early December {{in conference}} with Tilden while {{committees}} examined the votes from the disputed states. The counts of the disputed ballots were inconclusive, {{with each of}} the states in question producing two sets of returns: one signed by Democratic officials, the other by Republicans, each claiming victory for their man. By January 1877, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which would be authorized to determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes.|$|E
5|$|Suu's {{signature}} {{was required}} to pass the ruling, but he referred <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> the HNC to get their opinion. The HNC turned down the request. There was speculation the HNC did this {{as many of them}} were old, and therefore did not appreciate the generals' negativity towards seniors—some South Vietnamese mockingly called the HNC the High National Museum. On December 19, a Saturday, the generals moved to dissolve the HNC by arresting some of its members. The HNC had already ceased to function in any meaningful way, as only 9 of the 17 members were still occasionally attending its meetings, and few on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|The British mandate in Palestine, {{where an}} Arab {{majority}} lived alongside a Jewish minority, presented the British {{with a similar}} problem to that of India. The matter was complicated by large numbers of Jewish refugees seeking {{to be admitted to}} Palestine following the Holocaust, while Arabs were opposed {{to the creation of a}} Jewish state. Frustrated by the intractability of the problem, attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> the United Nations to solve. The UN General Assembly subsequently voted for a plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state.|$|E

5|$|The Scots {{assembled}} {{a force of}} about 12,000, {{some of which were}} returned veterans of the Thirty Years War, led by Alexander Leslie, formerly the Field Marshal of the Swedish Army. Charles gathered a force of perhaps 20,000, many of which were ill-trained militia. There were a series of minor actions in the north of Scotland, which secured the Covenanter's rear against Royalist support and skirmishing on the border. As neither side wished to push <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> a full military conflict, a temporary settlement was concluded, known as the Pacification of Berwick in June 1639, and the First Bishops' War ended with the Covenanters retaining control of the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between king and magnates {{was caused by}} dissatisfaction with the influence of foreigners at court, and Henry's high level of taxation. In 1258 Henry was forced to accept the Provisions of Oxford, that essentially left royal government {{in the hands of}} a council of magnates, but this document went through a long series of revocations and reinstatements. In 1263, as the country was on the brink of civil war, the two parties agreed to submit <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> arbitration by the French king. Louis was a firm believer in the royal prerogative, and decided clearly in favour of Henry.|$|E
5|$|A Cape Coloured of Indian and Portuguese ancestry, D'Oliveira left South Africa {{primarily}} because the era's apartheid legislation seriously restricted his career prospects on racial grounds and barred {{him from the}} all-white Test team. He qualified for Worcestershire County Cricket Club through residency in 1964 and first played for England two years later. The consequences of D'Oliveira's possible inclusion in the 1968–69 MCC tour of South Africa were discussed by English and South African cricketing bodies as early as 1966. Manoeuvring by cricketing and political figures in both countries did little to bring <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>to</b> a head. The MCC's priority was to maintain traditional links with South Africa and have the series go ahead without incident. South Africa's Prime Minister B.J. Vorster sought to appease international opinion by publicly indicating that D'Oliveira's inclusion would be acceptable, but secretly did all he could to prevent it.|$|E
