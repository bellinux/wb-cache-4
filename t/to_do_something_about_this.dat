The first step was taken. In March 2012, Denny JA published his collection of poetic essays entitled Atas Nama Cinta, or In the Name of Love. These were stories of discrimination in different guises, based on ethnicity, religion or religious understanding, gender and sexual oriententation.|$|E

50|$|The Snake River wound through wheat-producing {{regions of}} eastern Washington. Farmers {{in these areas}} wanted to ship their {{products}} out as cheaply as possible, and looked to riverine transport {{as a way to}} do it. The problem was there were too many rapids and other obstructions to allow economic use of the river in its natural state. O.S.N. pressured the government <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> and so in 1867, the Corps of Engineers launched a two year survey of the upper Columbia and the Snake River, targeting rapids and other areas for work to improve navigability. During the next few years, rapids and obstructions at various points in both these rivers were removed or meliorated, largely at government expense.|$|E

I should hate to think that we need such a repressive regime to get our cities cleaned to their standards." ...|$|E

5000|$|In March 2007, Mirkarimi {{introduced}} legislation that prohibits large supermarkets and drugstores from providing customers with non-biodegradable plastic bags, making San Francisco the first city to regulate such bags. Since then other {{cities around the}} country and in Europe have taken up similar bans, and there is a move by the California legislature to do the same. [...] Mirkarimi said, [...] "Instead of waiting for the federal government <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> country's oil dependence, environmental degradation or contribution to global warming, local governments can step up and do their part. The plastic bag ban is one small part of that." [...] Many supermarkets opposed such legislation. The bill passed 10-1 and became an ordinance. Although the ban was initially criticized as [...] "cosmetic" [...] by the SF Weekly, which asserted that the ban has led to an increase in the use of paper bags, a practice they claim is worse for the environment, the ban also requires stores to charge a ten-cent fee for each paper bag used, to encourage consumers to use reusable shopping bags. All revenues from the fee are kept by the stores. In 2012, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed an expansion of the ban to include to all retailers citywide.|$|E
5000|$|When the Hillsborough {{disaster}} {{occurred in}} 1989, Fulham {{were in the}} second bottom rung of The Football League, but following the Taylor report Fulham's ambitious chairman Jimmy Hill tabled plans in 1996 for an all-seater stadium. These plans never came to fruition, partly due to local residents' pressure groups, {{and by the time}} Fulham reached the Premiership, they still had standing areas in the ground, something virtually unheard of at the time. A year remained <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> (teams reaching the second tier for the first time are allowed a three-year period to reach the required standards for the top two divisions), {{but by the time the}} last league game was played there, against Leicester City on 27 April 2002, no building plans [...] had been made. Two more Intertoto Cup games were played there later that year (against FC Haka of Finland and Egaleo FC of Greece), and the eventual solution was to decamp to Loftus Road, home of local rivals QPR. During this time, many Fulham fans only went to away games in protest of moving from Craven Cottage. 'Back to the Cottage', later to become the 'Fulham Supporters Trust', was set up as a fans pressure group to encourage the chairman and his advisers that Craven Cottage was the only viable option for Fulham Football Club.|$|E
50|$|The Man {{who changed}} the Future (June 1931), first {{published}} in Wonder Stories. A time travel story, set in the years 1930 and 2030. The city of Lakopolis where the action takes place is an obvious stand-in for Chicago. In the year 1930, crime-ridden Lakopolis has gangsters acting openly and exercising power. Park Helm, the protagonist, would like <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> situation. However, for the time being, he wonders of the long-term consequences of the current situation; one Professor Nicholson offers {{him a chance to}} find out about them. The scientist has developed a way to send the astral body of a person to any point in time, a method involving the magnetic fields of a giant electric generator disrupting the aether. Helm successfully arrives in the year 2030, as an unseen spectator. He finds Lakopolis worse than ever and gangsters running rampant. When he witnesses an individual gangster trying to force marriage on a young woman, Helm tries to intervene and somehow materializes a body for himself. Permanently settling in this era, Helm becomes the leader of a reform movement. His movement tries to reclaim this city for its honest citizens. Bleiler found this story unsuccessful, and self-contradictory. After a long explanation that only the astral body of the individual can travel in time, not his corporeal body, the story shifts in the opposite direction, with no real explanation.|$|E
