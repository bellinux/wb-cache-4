25|$|Ball {{bearings}} {{designed to}} support high speeds and temperatures are sometimes {{used instead of}} fluid bearings to support the <b>turbine</b> <b>shaft.</b> This helps the turbocharger accelerate more quickly and reduces turbo lag. Some variable nozzle turbochargers use a rotary electric actuator, which uses a direct stepper motor to open and close the vanes, rather than pneumatic controllers that operate based on air pressure.|$|E
25|$|In this situation, {{the surge}} {{can raise the}} {{pressure}} of the air to a level that can cause damage. This is because if the pressure rises high enough, a compressor stall occurs—stored pressurized air decompresses backward across the impeller and out the inlet. The reverse flow back across the turbocharger makes the <b>turbine</b> <b>shaft</b> reduce in speed more quickly than it would naturally, possibly damaging the turbocharger.|$|E
40|$|<b>Turbine</b> <b>shafts</b> are {{basically}} used in steam turbine, hydro turbine and wind <b>turbines.</b> These <b>turbine</b> <b>shafts</b> require very stringent properties. Generally high yield strength, tensile strength and percentage elongation are required along with high impact values {{at the same}} time. In addition, the material should exhibit good high temperature properties such as creep, elevated temperature strength and thermal stability. Practically the <b>turbine</b> <b>shafts</b> used are very massive in size. Hence, the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} should be small so as to maintain a minimum temperature gradient between the core and the surface of <b>turbine</b> <b>shafts.</b> If the temperature gradient crosses a certain limit, it may lead to generation of crack inside the structure. As mentioned, we require high tensile properties along with good impact strength for proper application. But it is generally observed that these two properties are inversely related to each other i. e. the efforts to increase the tensile strength of materials results in decrease in impact strength and vice versa. Therefore, one has to judiciously select the heat treatment parameters so as to maintain a good combination of these properties. ...|$|R

2500|$|Two LOT Polish Airlines flights, both Ilyushin Il-62s, {{suffered}} catastrophic uncontained engine {{failures in}} the 1980s. [...] The first was in 1980 on LOT Flight 7 where flight controls were destroyed, killing all 87 on board. [...] In 1987, on LOT Flight 5055, [...] the aircraft's inner left (#2) engine, damaged the outer left (#1) engine, setting both on fire and causing in-flight break up, killing all 183 people on board. [...] In both cases, the <b>turbine</b> <b>shaft</b> in engine #2 disintegrated due to production defects in the engines' bearings, which were missing rollers.|$|E
2500|$|Turbine2 had {{experienced}} problems {{for a long}} time prior to the 2009 accident. The first of these appeared after its installation in 1979. [...] Throughout 1980-1983, numerous problems with seals, <b>turbine</b> <b>shaft</b> vibrations and bearings surfaced. From the end of March to the end of November 2000, a complete reconditioning of turbine2 was performed. Cavities up to [...] deep and cracks up to [...] long were found on the turbine runner and repaired. [...] Many other defects were found in the turbine bearings and subsequently repaired. In 2005, further repairs were made to turbine2. The problems found were similar in several aspects to the defects observed during the previous repair.|$|E
2500|$|Barring gear (or [...] "turning gear") is the {{mechanism}} provided to rotate the turbine generator shaft {{at a very}} low speed after unit stoppages. Once the unit is [...] "tripped" [...] (i.e., the steam inlet valve is closed), the turbine coasts down towards standstill. When it stops completely, {{there is a tendency}} for the <b>turbine</b> <b>shaft</b> to deflect or bend if allowed to remain in one position too long. This is because the heat inside the turbine casing tends to concentrate in {{the top half of the}} casing, making the top half portion of the shaft hotter than the bottom half. The shaft therefore could warp or bend by millionths of inches.|$|E
