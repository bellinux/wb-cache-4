5|$|While the Japanese raid {{into the}} Indian Ocean was not successful, {{associated}} Japanese shipping movements provoked a major Allied response. In early March 1944, Allied intelligence reported that two battleships escorted by destroyers had left Singapore {{in the direction}} of Surabaya and a U.S. submarine made radar contact with two large Japanese ships in the Lombok Strait. The Australian Chiefs of Staff Committee reported to the Government on 8 March that there was a possibility that these ships could have entered the Indian Ocean to attack Fremantle. In response <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>report,</b> all ground and naval defences at Fremantle were fully manned, all shipping was ordered to leave Fremantle and several RAAF squadrons were redeployed to bases in Western Australia.|$|E

The {{report of a}} special troop, which had been sent into the Partisans’ rear {{with the help of}} disguised Chetniks several days earlier, drew particular attention from Rendulic. According <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>report,</b> received late on 25 May, Tito was in the area of Potoci, halfway between Drvar and Ribnik. Rendulic ordered the commander of the 7th SS Division to immediately form a special company-strong detachment, with a mission to infiltrate behind the Partisan lines in order to kill Tito and destroy the Partisan Supreme Command. The detachment was formed on the night of 25/26 May from the 11th Company of the 13th SS Regiment, a number of pioneers, and a group of specially trained personnel from the Brandenburg Division. As the detachment failed to penetrate into the Partisan territory that night, it tried again the following night.|$|E

25|$|An answer <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>report</b> {{was found}} when Nazi Germany invaded in 1941. Churches were re-opened under the German occupation, while believers flocked {{to them in}} the millions. In order to gain support for the war effort (both {{domestic}} and foreign), Stalin ended the antireligious persecution and the LMG was disbanded. Internal pressure to end the persecution came from the need to win the loyalty of religious Soviet citizens for the war effort, while external pressure came from the Allies, who would not support Stalin if he continued the campaign.|$|E

25|$|This {{approach}} {{highlighted the}} need for effective institutional coordination, which enabled different parties to work together around common priority socioeconomic objectives. The private sector is the least active player in research activity in Morocco. The REMINEX Corporation (Research on Mines and Exploitation) is the most prominent research performer in the private sector, and is a subsidiary of Omnium Nord Africain, the largest privately owned mining group in Morocco.

25|$|Sub-Saharan Africa {{nations are}} {{globally}} achieving impressive improvements in well-being, {{according to a}} report by Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative and the Boston Consulting Group. Angola has upgraded critical infrastructure, an investment made possible by funds from the nation's development of oil resources. According <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>report,</b> just slightly more than ten years after the end of the civil war Angola's standard of living has overall greatly improved. Life expectancy, which was just 46 years in 2002, reached 51 in 2011. Mortality rates for children fell from 25 percent in 2001 to 19 percent in 2010 and the number of students enrolled in primary school has tripled since 2001. However, at the same time the social and economic inequality that has characterised the country since long has not diminished, but on the contrary deepened in all respects.|$|E

25|$|In 2017, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention {{recommended}} light {{exercises and}} stretching {{but not in}} the four hours before bed to help with sleep. Stretching and movement therapies are also recommended for pain. Previously, a 2014 National Institutes of Health report concluded that while GET could produce benefits, it may not yield improvement in quality of life and that because of this limitation, GET should not be considered as a primary treatment, but instead be used only as one component of a broader approach. The report also noted that a focus on exercise programs had discouraged patient participation in other types of physical activity, due to concerns of precipitating increased symptoms. A July 2016 addendum <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>report</b> recommended that the Oxford criteria not be used when studying ME/CFS. If studies based on the Oxford criteria were excluded, there would be insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of GET on any outcome.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great; we can form only an approximative {{estimate}} {{of what is}} going on in those parts of the South which are not closely garrisoned, and from which no regular reports are received, by what occurs under the very eyes of our military authorities. As to my personal experience, I will only mention that during my two days sojourn at Atlanta, one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom died. While I was at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with their lives. Several papers attached <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>report</b> give an account of the number of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain period of time.

25|$|Most {{turbines}} in the European Union produce electricity at {{an average}} of 25% of their rated maximum power due to the variability of wind resources, but Scotland's wind regime provides average capacity factor of 31% or higher on the west and northern coasts. The load factor recorded for the onshore North Rhins windfarm near Stranraer was 40%, which is typical for well-sited mainland windfarms. A small wind farm on Shetland with five Vestas V47 660kW turbines recently achieved a world record of 58% capacity {{over the course of a}} year. This record is claimed by Burradale windfarm, located just outside Lerwick and operated by Shetland Aerogenerators Ltd. Since opening in 2000, the turbines at this wind farm have had an average capacity factor of 52% and, according <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>report,</b> in 2005 averaged a world record 57.9%. However, a Scottish opposition group found 124 separate occasions from 2008 to 2010 when the nation's wind output fell to less than 2% of installed capacity. On the west and northern coasts Scotland's wind regime can provide an average of 40% or higher.|$|E

500|$|The British {{aircraft}} {{failed to}} achieve surprise. German radar stations had been tracking the Home Fleet's routine anti-submarine and fighter patrols, and the Seafires were detected at 4:40 pm when they were [...] from Kaafjord. In response <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>report,</b> the smoke generators around Kaafjord were activated and the fjord's defenders went to their battle positions. The arrival of {{the main body of}} British aircraft over Kaafjord was delayed by stronger than expected winds and a navigational error, and they did not reach the target area until 5:25 pm. By this time Tirpitz was covered in a very thick smokescreen, and none of the British airmen sighted the ship. The Barracudas and Corsairs were forced to blind-bomb Kaafjord, and while no hits were achieved on the battleship, six members of her crew were wounded by bomb fragments from near misses. German ships and gun positions were once again strafed by the fighters, but no significant damage was inflicted. Heavy anti-aircraft gunfire from Tirpitz, which was directed by a party of observers stationed on a mountain near Kaafjord, shot down a Corsair and a Firefly.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>report,</b> Stone {{thought the}} Confederate forces were indeed leaving Leesburg, {{and decided to}} investigate further. While he led part of his command directly across at Edwards Ferry at 5 p.m., Stone ordered Col. Charles Devens and 300 men of his 15th Massachusetts to immediately cross over to Ball's Bluff that night. Stone's instructions were to [...] "March silently under cover of night {{to the position of}} the camp [...] attack and destroy it at daybreak... and return rapidly to the island." [...] Devens carried out Stone's orders and made the difficult crossing on three small 10-man boats, taking him four hours to accomplish. Stone also gave Devens discretion over what to do after the attack; either hold Leesburg or return to Harrison's Island. Stone ordered the rest of the 15th Massachusetts over and added the 20th Massachusetts Infantry, under Col. William R. Lee, to this effort as well, and ordered Colonel and U.S. Senator Edward D. Baker to take overall command. Devens found no camp, since an earlier patrol apparently confused corn shocks as tents in the evening shadows; he halted and asked Stone for instructions, who responded to push closer to Leesburg. Devens determined to hold there, waiting several hours for reinforcements, when skirmishing began at 7 a.m., before Baker had arrived.|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{appeared}} {{to the justice}} to be a profoundly troubled young man. There was {{no doubt that he}} had killed Chaykoski and Woloch, he had not acted in self-defence and {{there was no evidence of}} provocation; the chances of reducing the murder charge to manslaughter were therefore slim. Nosanchuk felt obliged, in the light of Lamb's psychiatric and personal history, to explore an insanity plea. The lawyer interviewed Yaworsky and Dolan, secured them as witnesses for the trial, and also reviewed a report from four doctors at Penetanguishene who had previously interviewed his client. According <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>report,</b> Lamb had been amiable, fluent in his conversation and apparently plausible; he at first claimed amnesia for the events of 25 June, but on continued questioning related what had happened [...] "in detail". He admitted his responsibility but still did not appear to be concerned about what had happened. He did not seem to be able to emotionally appreciate the consequences of his actions, even though he understood on an intellectual level that he had shot at some people and that to do that was wrong. When he told the psychiatrists that he regretted what he had done, they wrote that he [...] "clearly did not have any real underlying feeling of remorse". He also did not appear to have considered that he might be suffering from any illness, mental or otherwise. The Penetanguishene report concluded that Lamb [...] "suffered from a disease of the mind as a pathological anti-social or psychopathic personality", which was a recognised psychiatric disorder under the Criminal Code and therefore grounds for an insanity defence in court.|$|E
