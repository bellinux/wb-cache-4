[...] Soon afterwards, the band began an ill-fated film project, Magical Mystery Tour. Starr's growing {{interest}} in photography at the time led to his billing as the movie's Director of Photography, and his participation in the film's editing was matched only by McCartney.|$|E
500|$|Godrich's {{father died}} {{on the day of}} the {{recording}} of the string sessions for [...] "Burn the Witch". According to Godrich, [...] "I literally left him on a fucking table in my house and went and recorded. And it was a very, very emotional day for me. He was a string player as well so it was one of those things where it felt like he would want me to go and just do this." [...] Around the same period, Yorke announced his separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. He told Rolling Stone: [...] "There was a lot of difficult stuff going on at the time, and it was a tough <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> as people. It was a miracle that that record got made at all." ...|$|E

As {{part of the}} {{exhibition}} Personal Structures, organised by Global Art Affairs, the installation was on view from June 1 through November 24, 2013, at the European Cultural Centre's Palazzo Bembo. In this feminist work of art, female silicon bodies were burnt in the Venetian lagoon, evoking the imagary of mythical phoenixes. When asked for the resemblance between the naming of her record Rising and this piece, Ono responded: [...] "Rising was telling all people that it is <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to rise and fight for our rights. But {{in the process of}} fighting together, women are still being treated separately in an inhuman way. It weakens the power of men and women all together. I hope Arising will wake up Women Power, and make us, men and women, heal together." ...|$|E
500|$|Melua's seventh album, In Winter, was {{released}} on 14 October 2016. For this record, Melua {{went back to her}} native Georgia to record an album with the Gori Women's Choir, a native Georgian all-woman singing troupe. Melua revealed during an interview with The Guardian that her partnership with Mike Batt had come to an end after her last album, as it was a six-album deal with Batt's Dramatico records. [...] "It was a six-album deal,” she explains, “so when the sixth one was done, you know – it was finished and it was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to part ways.....It was maybe a bit more mutual on one side than the other. Yeah – it wasn’t easy, as you can imagine. And I'm still incredibly proud of the work we did together. But it had to happen and I think it has been mutual ... um, eventually." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1983 and 1984, Crass {{were part}} of the Stop the City actions co-ordinated by London Greenpeace which foreshadowed the {{anti-globalisation}} rallies of the early 21st century. Support for these activities was provided in the lyrics and sleeve notes of the band's last single, [...] "You're Already Dead", expressing doubts about their commitment to non-violence. It was also a reflection of disagreements within the group, as explained by Rimbaud; [...] "Half the band supported the pacifist line and half supported direct and if necessary violent action. It was a confusing <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> and I think a lot of our records show that, inadvertently". This led to introspection within the band, with some members becoming embittered and losing sight of their essentially positive stance. Reflecting this debate, the next release under the Crass name was Acts of Love: classical-music settings of 50 poems by Penny Rimbaud, described as [...] "songs to my other self" [...] and intended to celebrate [...] "the profound sense of unity, peace and love that exists within that other self".|$|E

500|$|Walsingham {{was driven}} by Protestant zeal to counter Catholicism, and sanctioned the use of torture against Catholic priests and {{suspected}} conspirators. Edmund Campion was among those tortured and found guilty {{on the basis of}} extracted evidence; he was hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn in 1581. Walsingham could never forget the atrocities against Protestants he had witnessed in France during the Bartholomew's Day massacre and believed a similar slaughter would occur in England {{in the event of a}} Catholic resurgence. Walsingham's brother-in-law Robert Beale, who was in Paris with Walsingham at the time of the massacre, encapsulated Walsingham's view: [...] "I think it time and more than <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to awake out of our dead sleep, and take heed lest like mischief as has already overwhelmed the brethren and neighbours in France and Flanders embrace us which be left in such sort as we shall not be able to escape." [...] Walsingham tracked down Catholic priests in England and supposed conspirators by employing informers, and intercepting correspondence. Walsingham's staff in England included the cryptographer Thomas Phelippes, who was an expert in deciphering letters and forgery, and Arthur Gregory, who was skilled at breaking and repairing seals without detection.|$|E
500|$|For Wasting Light, Grohl {{stated that}} they {{would go back to}} a rawer and heavier sound after [...] "exploring new musical ground" [...] on the {{previous}} records, adding that [...] "with the last album we were too concerned with being musical, now it's <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to be a rock band again". To contrast with the [...] "seven or eight minute-long songs, with seven or eight sections, and two or three time changes" [...] Grohl played with Them Crooked Vultures, he instead tried to compose the [...] "tightest, catchiest four-and-a-half-minute 'softball bat to your face' songs". Hawkins added that he liked Wasting Light for being [...] "straightforward, and that’s a good thing for us right now. The last couple [...] had some big dynamic changes." [...] Grohl described the effort as their heaviest yet, later saying it was done because [...] "I'm 42 now. I don't know if I'm {{going to be able to}} make this record when I'm 46 or 49. It's my last chance." [...] While the demos that prompted Grohl to say the album would be their heaviest yet were not used on the album, Vig took the declarations to heart, following three criteria while recording: [...] "It's got to be hooky, heavy, and we're going analog all the way." ...|$|E
500|$|The band took a {{break from}} {{performing}} live between the NetAid charity concert in October 1999 and 2001. They returned to {{the stage for a}} further charity gig on 28 April, in support of Unison's campaign for a living wage at the Manchester Evening News Arena. Matthews said prior to the performance that [...] "It's a cause I think's really important and it just seemed to be the right <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to come back – it's a long, long time since we played live. It should be really great. We're really looking forward to what they (the new songs) are going to sound like live. It'll be good {{to get back on the}} old live circuit again." [...] They played several tracks from their upcoming album, at that point entitled It's What's Not There That Makes What's There What It Is. By May, it had been renamed to Paper Scissors Stone. Matthews was looking forward to the new releasing, explaining to NME that [...] "I think it's stronger than the last album, a bit more avant garde!...It's a bit less stupid. [...] was all over the shop stylistically, I think it's a bit more focused. And I think it's a bit more impassioned".|$|E

500|$|Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe {{said that}} [...] "Bally's in Las Vegas set the Red Sox as 8–5 {{favorites}} {{to win the}} Series" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "some sentiment in St. Louis that the NL champions have been disrespected." [...] but also that Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein [...] "Did not want to dis the Cardinals." [...] Shaughnessy also quoted Schilling as having said: [...] "There's a lot of good players in that [...] clubhouse over there. This isn't the <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to be thinking about history. If we get three wins and 26 outs into the fourth win, I'm pretty sure it will hit us." [...] Before the series began, Shaughnessy wrote a piece saying that although the Red Sox had beaten the Yankees, the series needed to be won, as {{it was the only way}} the Curse of the Bambino, which he had publicized based on the book of the same title in 1990, would end, and demeaning chants of [...] "1918!" [...] would no longer echo at Yankee Stadium. During the series, he wrote a piece about how much people in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for the Red Sox, hoping that one day, they would see their Red Sox win a World Series.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2010, {{the entire}} group were in Los Angeles for a birthday, where Manson {{suggested}} they book a studio and spend time writing. Along with Garbage's long time engineer and Manson's husband Billy Bush, the band, as Bush described, [...] "hung out for a couple weeks, drank some wine and played a bunch of music”. Three or four song ideas came together during this time. [...] "But we didn't go right into making-a-record mode", Erikson recalled. [...] "It took a bit of <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> {{to realize that we}} were going to make an album." [...] Erikson described reconvening as a piecemeal process, saying that it informally began with the first phone conversations among them since their hiatus, as they discussed playing together again. After convening, and composing and performing song ideas together through multiple sessions, they then decided to move forward with the band and embark on a full-length album. The project took off in February 2011, when Manson called Vig proposing to reunite the band and try making a new record. Manson convoked the group out of an eagerness [...] "to make loud music again". [...] "I'm a loud person", she proclaimed; [...] "I love noise and aggression. I crave contact. I needed to make that connection again. I think we all did. To get something back up when there was absolutely no momentum took a Herculean effort on everybody's part. It's like pulling yourself out of mud. Even to stand back up and say 'we're going to take another swing at this' was a scary feeling, and I'm proud of us for trying. It's much easier to stay at home.” ...|$|E

[...] Barron aimed to get 50,000 votes in the governor's race, enough to gain ballot access for the party, but ended up with 24,560 votes out of over 3,000,000 cast. More than 75% of the votes cast for Barron originated in New York City.|$|E
