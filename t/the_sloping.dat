40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} {{centrifuge}} model tests {{was conducted on}} a nail-reinforced slope under vertical surface loading conditions considering different slope gradients and nail lengths. The ultimate load of <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> decreased significantly with the increasing gradient of <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> or <b>the</b> decreasing nail length. <b>The</b> <b>slope</b> exhibited significant progressive failure that was captured by a displacement-based analysis. At first, the vertical load caused local slippage near <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> toe and <b>the</b> inner edge of the loading plate. Then, it extended to the interior of <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> and eventually to an entire slip surface. The H-surface was obtained according to the measured displacement to distinguish the zone where the surface load influenced the horizontal displacement of <b>the</b> <b>slope.</b> <b>The</b> H-surface and the position where the peak vertical displacement occurred in a horizontal line moved from <b>the</b> internal <b>slope</b> to <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> surface from <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> top to <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> bottom.

5|$|Cantharellus lateritius, {{commonly}} known as the smooth chanterelle, is a species of edible fungus in the Cantharellaceae family of mushrooms. A ectomycorrhizal species, it is found in Asia, Africa, and North America. The species has a complex taxonomic history, and has undergone several name changes since its first description by American mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1822. The fruit bodies of the fungus are brightly colored yellow to orange, and usually highly conspicuous against the soil in which they are found. At maturity, the mushroom resembles a filled funnel with the spore-bearing surface along <b>the</b> <b>sloping</b> outer sides. The texture of the fertile undersurface (hymenium) of the caps is a distinguishing characteristic of the species: unlike the well-known golden chanterelle, the hymenium of C.lateritius is much smoother. Chemical analysis has revealed the presence of several carotenoid compounds in the fruit bodies.|$|E

Well-established computational and analytical methods are available for linear convolution, such as the Fourier Transform.

40|$|Slope {{stability}} issues {{become one}} of the main problems in construction industry due to nature of the topography and the weather conditions in Malaysia. Improper slope analysis design might cause slope failure which has been acknowledged {{as one of the most}} frequent disaster that can lead to great loss of properties and life. To overcome this problem, analysis of slope failure must be carried out to determine <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> stability. This slope failure study has contributed to local engineering studies regarding <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> failure that occurred at Kuala Wau-Kertau road which located in Maran. This study analyses <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> stability and proposes the method of ground improvement to be applied on <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> in term of factor of safety (FOS) and cost. Data from the soil investigation report of <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> is used to analyze the stability of <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> using GeoStudio 2007 Slope/w. From the results, the FOS of <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> before <b>the</b> failure by using Morgenstern-Price Method is 1. 710 which can be considered as stable due to the FOS value is more than 1. According to FOS value, the failure is not due to improper design at the preliminary stages of constructing the road but may be due to other factors. By comparing the analysis of remedial measures to <b>the</b> <b>slope,</b> <b>the</b> best method remedial measure to be applied on <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> in term of FOS value and cost is by using anchors.

Assailed by a tremendous volume of small-arms, mortar and artillery fire as he advanced with one squad of his section in the initial assault wave, Sergeant Cole boldly led his men up <b>the</b> <b>sloping</b> beach toward Airfield Number One despite the blanketing curtain of flying shrapnel and, personally destroying with hand grenades two hostile emplacements which menaced the progress of his unit, continued to move forward until a merciless barrage of fire emanating from three Japanese pillboxes halted the advance. Instantly placing his one remaining machine gun in action, he delivered a shattering fusillade and succeeded in silencing the nearest and most threatening emplacement before his weapon jammed and the enemy, reopening fire with knee mortars and grenades, pinned down his unit for the second time. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation and evolving a daring plan of counterattack, Sergeant Cole, armed solely with a pistol and one grenade, coolly advanced alone to the hostile pillboxes. Hurling his one grenade at the enemy in sudden, swift attack, he quickly withdrew, returned to his own lines for additional grenades and again advanced, attacked, and withdrew. With enemy guns still active, he ran the gauntlet of slashing fire a third time to complete the total destruction of the Japanese strong point and the annihilation of the defending garrison in this final assault. Although instantly killed by an enemy grenade as he returned to his squad, Sergeant Cole had eliminated a formidable Japanese position, thereby enabling his company to storm the remaining fortifications, continue the advance and seize the objective. By his dauntless initiative, unfaltering courage and indomitable determination during a critical period of action, Sergeant Cole served as an inspiration to his comrades, and his stouthearted leadership in the face of almost certain death sustained and enhanced the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E

Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation shortly after landing when his company's advance was held up by the concentrated fire of a heavily fortified Japanese blockhouse, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE boldly defied the smashing bombardment of heavy caliber fire to work {{his way around the}} flank and up to a position directly on top of the blockhouse and then, attacking with grenades and demolitions, single handedly destroyed the entire hostile strong point and its defending garrison. Consistently daring and aggressive as he fought his way over the battle-torn beach and up <b>the</b> <b>sloping,</b> gun-studded terraces toward Airfield Number 1, he repeatedly exposed himself to the blasting fury of exploding shells and later in the day coolly proceeded to the aid of a friendly tank which had been trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages, skillfully guiding the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite the overwhelming volume of hostile fire. In the forefront of the assault at all times, he pushed forward with dauntless courage and iron determination until, moving upon the edge of the airfield, he fell, instantly killed by a bursting mortar shell. Stouthearted and indomitable, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE, by his intrepid initiative, outstanding skill, and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice {{in the face of the}} fanatic opposition, contributed materially to the advance of his company during the early critical period of the assault, and his unwavering devotion to duty throughout the bitter conflict was an inspiration to his comrades and reflects the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE and the United States Naval Service.
