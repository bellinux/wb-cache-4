40|$|Following {{up on the}} {{prediction}} by classical sociological theorists that neighbours will become irrelevant as societies become more mobile, this research examines the strength of people's social <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> neighbours and the associations thereof with residential, physical and virtual mobility using longitudinal data for Germany. Unlike previous studies, the research considers the three forms of mobility simultaneously and contrasts its effects on social <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> neighbours to those with family. The results show that residential and physical mobility are negatively associated <b>with</b> social <b>ties</b> to neighbours and positively <b>with</b> <b>ties</b> to family. Virtual mobility does not weaken social <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> neighbours but <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> family. The positive association between mobility and social <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> family may not {{be strong enough to}} ascertain that people maintain as close social ties to others in the future as it does not outweigh the negative association with visiting neighbours. © London School of Economics and Political Science 2013...|$|R
