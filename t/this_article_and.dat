Even though by law Vatican City is not part of Italy, it is in Rome, and along with Latin, Italian is the most spoken and second language of the Roman Curia.|$|E
25|$|The cDNAs {{encoding}} LT and TNF were cloned in 1984 {{and were}} {{revealed to be}} similar. The binding of TNF to its receptor and its displacement by LT confirmed the functional homology between the two factors. The sequential and functional homology of TNF and LT led to the renaming of TNF as TNFα (<b>this</b> <b>article)</b> <b>and</b> LT as TNFβ. In 1985, Bruce A. Beutler and Anthony Cerami discovered that cachectin (a hormone which induces cachexia) was actually TNF. They then identified TNF as a mediator of lethal endotoxin poisoning. Kevin J. Tracey and Cerami discovered the key mediator role of TNF in lethal septic shock, and identified the therapeutic effects of monoclonal anti-TNF antibodies.|$|E

25|$|In 1924, the Washington Tug and Barge Co. {{sold the}} Patterson to C.K. West Co. of Portland Oregon who {{converted}} {{her to a}} motorship for operation along the Oregon coast; the steam engine was replaced with a diesel, probably the four-cylinder Bolinder engine she had in 1930. It was probably at this time or a year later that she underwent a substantial rebuilding. Her deckhouse, bowsprit and eventually also her mizzenmast were removed, her bow was reshaped, and the fore and main masts were replaced with, or reduced to, pole masts. A stern deckhouse and superstructure were constructed. These changes {{are evident in the}} photos of the 1938 shipwreck (<b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>and</b> external links) and in a 1930 photo taken at Herschel Island.|$|E
25|$|TSA rules {{state that}} the range-jumping generals cannot capture an equal or higher-ranking piece, not just that they cannot jump over them. This gives a huge {{advantage}} to Black, so that Black can win every game if played right, but is not supported by Japanese articles on tenjiku shogi and has been largely abandoned in the West as unplayable. This {{is due to the}} very terse wording of the historical documents, that do not make it clear if the capture of an equal or higher-ranking piece is allowed even if such a piece cannot be jumped over. The presence of the king in the hierarchy suggested the TSA rules, since the king cannot jump-capture at all, and in any situation where the enemy king could be jumped over it would not happen in practice as it would simply be captured. Due to the resulting playability problem, it was suggested that capturing would be allowed but not jumping, but this allowed for smothered mates in the opening and again gives a huge advantage to Black. However, the rule used in <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>and</b> The Chess Variant Pages, which allows the capture of equal or higher-ranking pieces except kings or princes, removes this advantage to Black.|$|E
500|$|In {{her initial}} article, Wrinch stated {{clearly that the}} cyclol model was merely a working hypothesis, a {{potentially}} valid model of proteins {{that would have to}} be checked. [...] Her goals in <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>and</b> its successors were to propose a well-defined testable model, to work out the consequences of its assumptions and to make predictions that could be tested experimentally. [...] In these goals, she succeeded; however, within a few years, experiments and further modeling showed that the cyclol hypothesis was untenable as a model for globular proteins.|$|E

500|$|Given this {{reliance}} on literary sources, {{it is doubtful}} whether Nostradamus used any particular methods for entering a trance state, other than contemplation, meditation and incubation. His sole description {{of this process is}} contained in letter 41 of his collected Latin correspondence. The popular legend that he attempted the ancient methods of flame gazing, water gazing or both simultaneously is based on a naive reading of his first two verses, which merely liken his efforts to those of the Delphic and Branchidic oracles. The first of these is reproduced at the bottom of <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>and</b> the second can be seen by visiting the relevant facsimile site (see External Links). In his dedication to King Henri II, Nostradamus describes [...] "emptying my soul, mind and heart of all care, worry and unease through mental calm and tranquility", but his frequent references to the [...] "bronze tripod" [...] of the Delphic rite are usually preceded by the words [...] "as though" [...] (compare, once again, External References to the original texts).|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} later, {{hundreds}} of people participated in a protest and march organized by UVA faculty as [...] "part {{of a series of}} responses to the recently published Rolling Stone article". A student quoted in The Daily Progress said that men at a nearby bar were [...] "quick to yell 'insults and slurs' at the protestors as they walked by". A local business owner expressed support of non-violent demonstrations and told The Cavalier Daily that [...] "The only way thing change is if you talk about what's happening." [...] The march ended outside of the Phi Kappa Psi house where protesters challenged a perceived [...] "culture of sexual assault at the University". Community members offered suggestions for immediate steps administration could take to implement preventative measures and address safety concerns regarding sexual assault. One student protestor told The Cavalier Daily: [...] "I really hope the University takes <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>and</b> the protest movement as a sign {{that they need to be}} more transparent about the way they deal with sexual assault." [...] Four participants who were sitting on the steps to the Phi Kappa Psi house were arrested on trespassing charges for refusing to move when police officers asked them to leave.|$|E
