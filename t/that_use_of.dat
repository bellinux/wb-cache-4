5|$|Dozens {{of birth}} control clinics opened across the United States during the 1920s, but not without incident.Robinson, Caroline Hadley (1930), Seventy Birth Control Clinics, Williams and Wilkins (70 clinics in U.S. and Britain by 1930, cited by Kennedy, p. 291). In 1929, New York police raided a clinic in New York and arrested two doctors and three nurses for distributing {{contraceptive}} information that was unrelated to the prevention of disease. The ABCL achieved a major victory in the trial, when the judge ruled <b>that</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> contraceptives to space births farther apart was a legitimate medical treatment that benefited {{the health of the}} mother. The trial, in which many prominent physicians served as witnesses for the defense, brought {{a large segment of the}} medical community onto the side {{of birth control}} advocates.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights (MDCR) filed a {{complaint}} with the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). MDCR's complaint asserted that new research clearly establishes <b>that</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> American Indian imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal learning environment in violation of Article VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that the legal standard required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which was not established.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} {{expected}} <b>that</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the chutes to transfer salt between the canal and the river would cease once the lift was opened, but {{by the turn of}} the 19th century, although there were 190,000 tons of cargo using the lift each year, 38,000 tons of salt were still being transferred by chute. From the middle of the 19th century, some of the salt traffic transferred to the railways, and the use of pipelines through which the brine was pumped also affected trade, but as that source of revenue declined, a chemical industry developed in the area around Northwich, which became the major source of income for the Navigation.|$|E

There were injuries from the quake {{on both sides of}} the border. The state Office of Emergency Preparedness declared 61 injuries on the American side and police claimed that 30 were injured in Mexico. The Red Cross stated that cuts from broken glass, bruises from falling objects, and a few broken bones were reported. California's Interstate 8 developed cracks in it, but vehicles were still able to traverse the highway. The CaliforniaHighwayPatrol warned drivers <b>that</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the road would be at their own risk.|$|E
5|$|The love dart {{is not a}} penial stylet (in {{other words}} {{this is not an}} {{accessory}} organ for sperm transfer). The exchange of sperm between both of the two land snails is a completely separate part of the mating progression. Nevertheless, recent research shows <b>that</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the dart can strongly favor the reproductive outcome for the snail that is able to lodge a dart in its partner. This is because mucus on the dart introduces a hormone-like substance that allows far more of its sperm to survive.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} anthem is frequently played at sign-ons and sign-offs of TV {{and radio stations}} in Singapore, but <b>that</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the anthem has declined somewhat {{by the emergence of}} 24-hour TV channels and radio stations. Media Corporation of Singapore's Channel 5, Channel 8 and Channel NewsAsia, for example, played the anthem just before 6:00 am daily to signal the start of their respective channel's broadcast day; while all of its owned radio stations begin their day by playing the abridged version of the anthem (consisting of the first six bars) at exactly 6:00 am, except Malay station Warna 94.2FM which plays it at 5:00 am as a way of protecting the protocol from reaching the Islamic Azan Subuh (which occurs between around 5:25 and 5:58 am).|$|E

5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to {{its effects on}} saliva. The reduction in saliva {{increases the likelihood of}} dental caries, enamel erosion, and periodontal disease. Although it is clear <b>that</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug, which includes high protein content, may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial began}} in the High Court of Justice on 30 January 1893, before Sir Henry Hawkins; Bottomley {{conducted}} his own defence. To most observers the case against him seemed impregnable. It was established that, through his nominees, Bottomley had repeatedly bought companies for {{far less than the}} prices approved by the Hansard Union directors, and had pocketed the difference. Bottomley did not deny this, insisting <b>that</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> nominees was an accepted commercial practice, and that his actual profits had been much smaller than reported; his expenses, he said, had been enormous. He was helped in his case by the slackness with which the prosecution presented its evidence, and their failure to call key witnesses. He was further helped by the indulgence which Hawkins showed him, and by his own convincing oratory. The essence of his argument was that he was the victim of machinations by the Official Receiver and the Debenture Corporation, who had been determined to win prestige by bringing Bottomley down and wrecking his company. On 26 April, after Hawkins had summed up massively in his favour, Bottomley was acquitted, along with the other defendants.|$|E
