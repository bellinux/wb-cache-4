5|$|In 1914, the Friedrichstraße {{station was}} rebuilt; the long-distance {{section of the}} station was {{expanded}} to four tracks and the current station hall was built. Between 1922 and 1932, the Stadtbahn viaduct was thoroughly modernised in order to handle the ever-increasing <b>train</b> <b>weight.</b> Also, the train sheds of Alexanderplatz and Schlesischer Bahnhof were replaced. The suburban line's platforms were raised to a height of 96 centimetres.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, NSB {{started the}} process of finding a {{replacement}} for the El 9. New locomotives would cost NOK20 million, and the company saw it as unrealistic to invest so much in a marginal branch line. NSB had also concluded its away-with-the-steam program, and therefore had a lack of locomotives in general. If {{a new class of}} locomotives was to be built, it would have to satisfy more than the requirements for the Flåm Line, so NSB instead started investigating whether any of the older models could be used. Tests were performed in 1971 and 1973 with El 11, built between 1951 and 1964, and El 13, built between 1957 and 1966. Neither was considered optimal: El 11 allowed the <b>train</b> <b>weight</b> to increase to , but the train had the steps for the voltage regulator and the commutation set for too high speeds. El 13 had rheostatic brakes, which were not suitable for the gradient; the locomotives were also better suited for mainline service and would therefore not be prioritized for branch lines.|$|E
25|$|An inquiry {{concluded}} that the accident had been triggered by post-construction settlement, compounded by excess speed due to {{the weight of the}} train. As a result of the inquiry's recommendations the maximum allowed <b>train</b> <b>weight</b> was reduced to the equivalent of 1½ carriages, leading to lighter carriages being bought and used on two-carriage trains. A gripper system was also installed on the rack railway.|$|E

To achieve this {{purpose of the}} study, forty-five men students studying CSSR & SRRM Degree College, Kamalapuram, YSR (D), Andhra Pradesh, India were randomly selected as subjects during the year 2015 - 2016. They were divided into three equal groups of fifteen subjects each. Group I underwent <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> parallel with plyometric training for three sessions per week for twelve weeks. Group II underwent <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> parallel with cross training for three sessions per week for twelve weeks. And group III acted as control group who did not participated in any of the special training programme. Speed endurance was only selected as dependent variable. <b>Weight</b> <b>training</b> parallel with plyometric <b>training</b> and <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> parallel with cross training were selected as independent variables. Speed endurance was measured by using 150 mts run. The data were collected at prior and immediately after the training programme on elastic power. The collected data were analysed statistically by using analysis of covariance. The scheffe’s post hoc test was used to find out paired mean differences, if any. The results of the study revealed that <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> with plyometric <b>training</b> and <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> with cross training groups significantly improved speed endurance when compared with control group.

25|$|As {{the main}} {{international}} railway out of Norway, the Østfold Line {{had some of}} the highest demands for speed and axle loads. In an effort to increase train weights and speeds, the Norwegian State Railways approved an upgrade plan in 1910 which was initially to be completed by 1919. All bridges and track was to be upgraded to tolerate a higher <b>train</b> <b>weight.</b> The break-out of the First World War led to material and funding shortages, and the upgrades were not completed until a new Sarp Bridge was finished in 1930.|$|E
500|$|NSB ordered three El 9 {{locomotives}} from Thune on 4 October 1940. The {{units were}} delivered in 1942, with the electrical components from NEBB and the transformers and controllers from Per Kure. A delay {{was caused by}} bombing of Per Kure by the resistance. [...] The locomotives were custom-built for the steep gradients on the Flåm and Hardanger Lines, and were delivered with an axle load of [...] and a Bo'Bo' wheel configuration. The locomotives weighed [...] and the maximum permitted <b>train</b> <b>weight</b> was [...] If the trains were to stop at Kårdal, the weight was further limited to [...]|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, NSB was {{in need of}} new {{electric}} haulage for their passenger trains, as both classes El 11 and El 13 were in need of replacement. El 17, the latest purchase, had proved unreliable, and NSB wanted to remove them from mainline service. In 1993, Re 460 and EuroSprinter locomotives were tested in Norway, with the Re 460 being tested from 28 August through 8 October. NSB was satisfied with both units, and stated that {{it would be possible to}} increase the <b>train</b> <b>weight</b> on the intercity services from [...] During the first half of 1994, NSB leased two Re 460s to have sufficient locomotives for operation during the 1994 Winter Olympics.|$|E

In addition to air brakes for the whole train, the locomotives are equipped with rheostatic brakes which is sufficiently powerful {{to allow for the}} 5.5 percent gradient. When braking, three of the motors are connected to the air-cooled resistance on the roof, while the last motor is connected to deliver magnetization current to the other three motors. The braking is regulated with 22 steps. As a backup, the units are equipped with a carborundum track brake {{on each side of the}} bogies.|$|E
500|$|In June 2015, it was {{reported}} that the ORR was planning to call a [...] "Safety Summit" [...] involving operators on charter trains on NR tracks. It {{was reported}} that one proposal to be put forward by the ORR was that all charter trains be limited to a maximum of eleven carriages. This, if enacted, would mean a loss of revenue of up to £5,000 per train for operators. Part of the reasoning behind the proposal was that steam locomotives have a lower rate of acceleration than modern traction. As they are limited to , they have to be worked harder in order to maintain time. A reduction in <b>train</b> <b>weight</b> would make acceleration rates a little faster and reduce the need to work locomotives so hard.|$|E
500|$|The Directorate for Enemy Property {{took over}} the German portion of the {{ownership}} of Sydvaranger after the war. In 1948, ownership of the company {{was transferred to the}} state.

The electric traction was taken out of use in 1955, but the overhead wires remained until 1963.

500|$|To {{allow for}} larger trains, the {{permanent}} way was upgraded.

In 1960, work started on demolishing the tracks at the port, followed by all tracks at the workshop at Kirkenes the following year. From then, all non-ore transport in the company was taken over using road transport. The three remaining electric shunters and the steam locomotive were chopped up. Two diesel shunters were sold to Norsk Jernverk in Mo i Rana. Up until this point, the railway had operated 33 steam locomotives, 14 electric locomotives and 4 diesel locomotives.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> is effective in improving body satisfaction of body image disturbed females. The methodology consisted of administering two body image questionnaires (Body Shape Questionnaire and Body Cathexis Scale) both prior to and following a 13 -week period either involving or avoiding <b>weight</b> <b>training.</b> All participants were also questioned regarding their exercise habits, more specifically, their experience with <b>weight</b> <b>training.</b> In addition, participants were pre- and posttested on both upper and lower body strength tests by determining their one-repetition maximum on the lateral pulldown and leg press. During the 13 -week period, participants took part in either a total-body <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> program supervised by one of two physical education staff or refrained from <b>weight</b> <b>training</b> completely.
