40|$|The {{applications}} of <b>targeted</b> <b>drugs</b> in treating cancers have significantly improved the survival rates of patients. However, {{in the clinical}} practice, <b>targeted</b> <b>drugs</b> are commonly combined with chemotherapy drugs, causing that the exact contribution of <b>targeted</b> <b>drugs</b> to the clinical outcome is difficult to evaluate. Quantitatively investigating the effects of <b>targeted</b> <b>drugs</b> on chemotherapy drugs on cancer cells is useful for us to understand drug actions and design better drugs. The advent of atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides {{a powerful tool for}} probing the nanoscale physiological activities of single live cells. In this paper, the detailed changes in cell morphology and mechanical properties were quantified on single lymphoma cells during the actions of rituximab (a monoclonal antibody <b>targeted</b> <b>drug)</b> and two chemotherapy drugs (cisplatin and cytarabine) by AFM. AFM imaging revealed the distinct changes of cellular ultramicro structures induced by the drugs. The changes of cellular mechanical properties after the drug stimulations were measured by AFM indenting. The statistical histograms of cellular surface roughness and mechanical properties quantitatively showed that rituximab could remarkably strengthen the killing effects of chemotherapy drugs. The study offers a new way to quantify the synergistic interactions between <b>targeted</b> <b>drugs</b> and chemotherapy drugs at the nanoscale, which will have potential impacts on predicting the efficacies of drug combinations before clinical treatments...|$|R

The study demonstrates that compared with liver cell, liver cancer cells (HepG 2) are easy to be disturbed by PLA/Fe 3 O 4 nanomagnetic microsphere, which have higher sensitivity and absorption ability.

50|$|Gold {{nanoparticles}} {{can be used}} {{to optimize}} the biodistribution of drugs to diseased organs, tissues or cells, in order to improve and <b>target</b> <b>drug</b> delivery.It is important to realize that the nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery is feasible only if the drug distribution is otherwise inadequate. These cases include drug targeting of difficult, unstable molecules (proteins, siRNA, DNA), delivery to the difficult sites (brain, retina, tumors, intracellular organelles) and drugs with serious side effects (e.g. anti-cancer agents). The performance of the nanoparticles depends on the size and surface functionalities in the particles. Also, the drug release and particle disintegration can vary depending on the system (e.g. biodegradable polymers sensitive to pH). An optimal nanodrug delivery system ensures that the active drug is available at the site of action for the correct time and duration, and their concentration should be above the minimal effective concentration (MEC) and below the minimal toxic concentration (MTC).|$|E

5000|$|The {{success of}} DNA {{nanotechnology}} in constructing artificially designed nanostructures out of nucleic acids such as DNA, {{combined with the}} demonstration of systems for DNA computing, has led to speculation that artificial nucleic acid nanodevices {{can be used to}} <b>target</b> <b>drug</b> delivery based upon directly sensing its environment. These methods make use of DNA solely as a structural material and a chemical, and do not make use of its biological role as the carrier of genetic information. Nucleic acid logic circuits that could potentially be used as the core of a system that releases a drug only in response to a stimulus such as a specific mRNA have been demonstrated. In addition, a DNA [...] "box" [...] with a controllable lid has been synthesized using the DNA origami method. This structure could encapsulate a drug in its closed state, and open to release it only in response to a desired stimulus.|$|E
50|$|Drugs diffuse through {{capillary}} {{walls in}} the same manner as endogenous molecules. One of the most important examples of this is drug diffusion across the blood brain barrier. The blood brain barrier consists of a bed of continuous capillaries. Typically only small hydrophobic molecules are able to diffuse across the blood brain barrier. This makes it very difficult to get drugs into the brain without invasively administering them directly into the brain. One possible solution is the utilization of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are synthesized to encapsulate a <b>target</b> <b>drug.</b> The surface of the nanoparticle, if not already hydrophobic, may have polymers attached to the surface to adjust the current polarity. Ligands can also be attached to the surface of a nanoparticle to target certain receptors located within the brain. Once the nanoparticle is through the blood brain barrier it releases the drug into the brain. A specific example of this solution is the delivery of anti-HIV drugs to the central nervous system by TAT-conjugated nanoparticles.|$|E
50|$|Papageorgio et al. {{also found}} that DMS {{patients}} had a lower P300 amplitude in the right hemisphere compared to the control group (non-DMS patients). From this result, the researchers implied that shorter P300 amplitudes are highly correlated with gray matter abnormalities; {{this finding is consistent}} with the DMS patients' characteristics and the presence of gray-matter deterioration. DMS patients were also found to have prolonged P300 lag, and their memory performance was lower than the control groups. The researchers were, thus, able to imply that DMS patients have trouble in focusing their resources to a stimulus; this was hypothesized to be caused by the neurodegeneration of the right hemisphere. Overall, other research studies have also provided evidence in the correlation of DMS and gray-matter degeneration of the right frontal region, which controls attentional resources. This research is important, because it can help determine the mechanisms of DMS, which can then help conjure a more effective <b>target</b> <b>drug</b> and/or treatment plan for those suffering from DMS.|$|E

50|$|Second, the SMART {{policing}} team {{located in}} Oakland, California, aimed toward reducing drug activity {{and cleaning up}} the environment at the places with problems. Lorraine G. Mazerolle reported {{the results of a}} randomized field study conducted in Oakland, CA. The study consisted of civil remedies were used to <b>target</b> <b>drug,</b> crime and disorder problems in 50 experimental places (1998). Mazerolle explains that Oakland decided to put together a Beat Health program, which is a program that is used to amplify social conditions and seeks to control drug, crime and disorder problems and restore order (1998). The police began by visiting nuisance locations and making working relations with citizens, apartment managers, landlords and business owners living or working both at the address that was a target (1998). The table below is from Mazerolle's reported results of the characteristics of the study locations. Apparently, most of the study sites were rental properties and twelve of the experimental sites were owner occupied.

5000|$|In Harris, one of {{the major}} points raised by a number of the amici curiae is that a dog's {{training}} or certification does not necessarily reflect that dog's reliability in the field. They point to what they say are [...] "the most comprehensive data available on the rate of false alerts in real-world settings" [...] - several years' of studies undertaken by an independent government agency in Sydney, Australia, under the Police Powers (Drug Detection Dogs) Act 2001. [...] Police dogs went through an initial 6 weeks of training to detect cannabis, ecstasy, methamphetamine, cocaine and heroin, received additional training weekly, and were tested and re-certified every three months. The police dogs would randomly sniff individuals at train stations, licensed premises, on streets and sidewalks, at nightclub strips, shopping centers, concerts, and other public locations - the dog would sit next to a person if it alerted. In the first 9 months of 2011, dogs alerted (and police searched) 14,102 times, and drugs were found only 2,854 times—a false alert rate of 80%. Those results, they say, are surprisingly consistent - in 2010, the false alert rate was 74%. [...] Further still, the study found that individual dog's performance varied wildly, with accuracy rates ranging from a high of 56% to a low of 7%, with two-thirds of the dogs performing below the average. The New South Wales' Ombudsman summarized his report by saying: [...] "Despite the best efforts of police officers, the use of drug detection dogs has proven to be an ineffective tool for detecting drug dealers. Overwhelmingly, the use of drug detection dogs has led to public searches of individuals in which no drugs were found, or to the detection of (mostly young) adults in possession of very small amounts of cannabis for personal use. These findings have led us to question whether the Drug Dogs Act will ever provide a fair, efficacious and cost effective tool to <b>target</b> <b>drug</b> supply. Given this, we have recommended that the starting point, when considering this report, is to review whether the Drug Dogs Act should be retained at all." ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{spatially}} offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) {{is demonstrated}} for noninvasively investigating {{the composition of}} drug mixtures inside an opaque plastic container. The mixtures consisted of three components including a <b>target</b> <b>drug</b> (acetaminophen or phenylephrine hydrochloride) and two diluents (glucose and caffeine). The <b>target</b> <b>drug</b> concentrations ranged from 5 % to 100 %. After conducting SORS analysis to ascertain the Raman spectra of the concealed mixtures, principal component analysis (PCA) {{was performed on the}} SORS spectra to reveal trends within the data. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to construct models that predicted the concentration of each <b>target</b> <b>drug,</b> {{in the presence of the}} other two diluents. The PLS models were able to predict the concentration of acetaminophen in the validation samples with a root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 3. 8 % and the concentration of phenylephrine hydrochloride with an RMSEP of 4. 6 %. This work demonstrates the potential of SORS, used in conjunction with multivariate statistical techniques, to perform noninvasive, quantitative analysis on mixtures inside opaque containers. This has applications for pharmaceutical analysis, such as monitoring the degradation of pharmaceutical products on the shelf, in forensic investigations of counterfeit drugs, and for the analysis of illicit drug mixtures which may contain multiple components. 8 page(s...|$|E
