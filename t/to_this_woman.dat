500|$|The episode further {{develops}} {{the relationship between}} Bree and Chuck, which is complicated by her involvement in the cover-up. [...] "Bree’s dilemma {{is the fact that}} she’s falling for a cop and trying to cover up this crime that she was sort of the ringleader on," [...] Daily explained. [...] "So her thing is instead of balancing work and pleasure, it’s balancing crime and pleasure." [...] Cross stated, [...] "I think we’ll figure out if that’s really a big love for her or if she’s able to let it go." [...] Jonathan Cake, who appeared as Chuck in four episodes during the seventh season, was promoted to series regular with this episode. On the relationship between Bree and Chuck, Cake stated: [...] "As a detective, he's sort of drawn <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> who seems both quite proper and conservative and yet can't seem to stop herself from being drawn into these sort of crazy, lurid scenarios. There's a sort of wild streak in Bree somewhere that he thinks is really interesting." [...] To prepare for the role, Cake watched key episodes of the series focusing on Bree's previous relationships.|$|E

If she is guiltless, {{and there is no}} fault on her part, but he leaves and neglects her, then no guilt attaches <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> she shall take her dowry and go back to her father's house." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{impossible}} for me to make any answer <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> but I took off my hat and bowed. The sail filled, and we glided away.|$|E
50|$|In 1920, the Society was incorporated, and in 1922 {{women were}} allowed to become full members. Prior <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>women</b> were granted Associate Memberships since 1903.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> <b>women</b> who aren't {{called in}} for a Pap test are sometimes required to pay a $5 fee if they request one. This can be a significant barrier to requesting a test, considering an average prisoner's wage is around 7 to 13 cents per hour.|$|R

60|$|Madame Christophor moved {{towards the}} bell, but Julien intercepted her. He remembered {{all that he}} owed <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman.</b> He was ashamed of his lack of tact.|$|E
60|$|In a dim, quite unanalytic way Father {{perceived}} that, <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> this drab {{prisoner of}} kitchen and woodshed, {{it was wonderful}} to meet a man and woman who had actually started for--anywhere.|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell you, landlord," [...] {{answered}} Morton, impatiently, [...] "that {{will not}} serve my purpose; I must go straight <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> Maclure's house, and I desire {{you to find}} me a guide." ...|$|E
6000|$|The noble lord then {{proceeds}} <b>to</b> abuse <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> of inferior rank in {{the language}} of the upper circles. He thus describes her person and manner:-- ...|$|R

60|$|MRS. BARLOW. I didn't come {{to speak}} to you, Gerald. I know you. I came <b>to</b> speak <b>to</b> <b>this</b> young <b>woman.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>To</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> Mbango gave Okandaga in charge, {{directing}} her in {{our presence}} {{how to care}} for her, and assuring her of the most terrible punishment should anything befall the woman committed to her care.|$|E
60|$|Always kindly, but {{moved to}} be unusually kind this evening, and having {{bestowed}} kind words {{on most of}} the children and aged people he has met, he at once bends down, and speaks <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|E
6000|$|LADY WINDERMERE. Us! From {{this moment}} {{my life is}} {{separate}} from yours. But {{if you wish to}} avoid a public scandal, write at once <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> and tell her that I forbid her to come here! ...|$|E
6000|$|What a voice;--what an accent;--and what words! Was there a man {{living with}} {{sufficient}} courage <b>to</b> take <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>to</b> England, and shew {{her to the}} world as Lady Peterborough? ...|$|R
30|$|We used point-of-care {{ultrasound}} <b>to</b> evaluate <b>this</b> young <b>women.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He won't have {{forgotten}} you," [...] said Bream Mortimer confidently. He {{did not see}} how it was humanly possible for anyone <b>to</b> forget <b>this</b> <b>woman.</b> She was like a celebrated chewing-gum. The taste lingered.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose she}} {{is very much the}} same as other women, after all, my dear," [...] said Mrs. Fletcher, who was almost jealous of the {{peculiar}} superiority of sentiment which her son seemed to attribute <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Hip. But, sir, I find it {{is against}} my nature. [...] I must love where I like; and, I believe, I may like all,-- [...] All that are fair. Come, bring me <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> [...] For I must have her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Mrs. Wortle, [...] "he {{certainly}} is--no more." [...] There came {{a certain}} accession of sadness to her voice, as she reflected that, after all, {{she was talking}} <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> {{of the death of}} her undoubted husband.|$|E
60|$|<b>To</b> <b>this</b> the <b>woman</b> did {{not make}} any reply, but they heard her fumbling at the door, evidently making certain that the lock and bolt were secure.|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means, madam, by no means; though, had we {{known it}} before, {{it might have}} been some aid to us in our search. Have we your {{permission}} <b>to</b> see <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> and <b>to</b> question her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gyp? Is {{that her}} name?" [...] And a sudden wish, almost a longing, not a {{friendly}} one, <b>to</b> see <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> seized her. [...] "Will you {{bring her to}} see me? I'm alone here till Wednesday." ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Lundie smiles satirically. Lady Holchester {{notices the}} smile; decides that mercy shown <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> is mercy misplaced; and announces (to her husband's horror) {{that she has}} news to tell of Sir Patrick, which will {{probably}} take his sister-in-law by surprise.|$|E
60|$|From where I sat I {{could see}} Jeeves in the dining-room, laying the breakfast-table. I wished I {{could have had}} a minute with him alone. I felt certain that he {{would have been able to}} think of some way of putting a stop <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|E
60|$|Let it {{be forgiven}} to Will {{that he had}} no such {{movement}} of pity. He had felt no bond beforehand <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> who had spoiled the ideal treasure of his life, and he held himself blameless. He knew that he was cruel, but he had no relenting in him yet.|$|E

50|$|Francisca {{lived in}} {{a time when it was}} very {{uncommon}} for educated women to teach and lecture in a university. Spain was one of the few places where women were able to succeed. A part of the reason for this was Queen Isabella who herself was a very well educated woman that encouraged “the love of study by personal example.” In addition <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> <b>women</b> like Francisca were oftentimes able to succeed because their fathers were already in that field and able to help open doors.|$|R
6000|$|... "He has vanished," [...] {{answered}} Caleb sullenly. [...] "Vanished"--here {{he glanced}} at Miriam with jealous and vindictive hate--"and in his place has left <b>to</b> us <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> the grand-daughter of Benoni, Miriam, who strangely enough was once his love." ...|$|R
60|$|She seemed {{of a mind}} to {{trip off}} <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> {{and as long as}} his own mother was safe, it did not greatly matter to Tommy whom she chose, but if it was this one, she was going the wrong way about it. You cannot snap them up in the street.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to be gained by {{shutting}} one's eyes to the truth," [...] she observed.

6000|$|... "Don't tear up {{my letter}} in a rage; I {{am not going}} to argue the {{question}} with you any further.

6000|$|... "It is {{certainly}} a very strange business," [...] the coroner said, [...] "and I hope that the police will spare no efforts <b>to</b> discover <b>this</b> <b>woman.</b> However, as she is not before us, we must proceed with the case." ...|$|R
50|$|Dubsky {{continued}} {{as a teacher}} and choreography throughout her life, including at the Chicago Conservatory of Music, and later at the University of Southern California.
