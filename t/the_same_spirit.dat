5|$|Guillory {{was to be}} a lead in the {{television}} series The Oaks, expected to begin airing in 2008. She joined Bahar Soomekh, Matt Lanter, Romy Rosemont, Jeremy Renner, Michael Rispoli and Shannon Lucio in the series, which follows the intertwining stories of three families—a young couple in 1968 who have lost a child, a family of four in 1998, and a pregnant couple in 2008—who are haunted by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirit</b> in their house. The television series began filming on 5 November 2007 on location in Pasadena, California. Guillory will play Jessica, the 2008 couple's neighbour, a woman who has Asperger syndrome who went to school with the husband (and father-to-be) and shares a secret with him.|$|E
5|$|The London {{establishment}} that governed the game were {{disturbed by the}} New Zealanders' approach to the game; reports of rough and over-aggressive play by the Natives had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain. In the north of England, criticism of the visitors' sportsmanship was rarer; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirit</b> as their local opponents, which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south. Some of the Natives, including Joe Warbrick, accused the RFU and the English press of hypocrisy, claiming that they were quick to criticise the New Zealanders for rough play, yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players.|$|E

25|$|Kiai {{is also a}} {{term used}} in Japanese martial arts, usually as a name for a loud yell {{accompanying}} an attack. Obviously this is outwardly more restrained {{in the context of}} a board game, but it is intended to be in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirit.</b>|$|E
25|$|The film is an {{anthology}} of various science fiction and fantasy stories adapted from Heavy Metal magazine and original stories in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirit.</b> Like the magazine, the film features {{a great deal of}} graphic violence, sexuality, and nudity. Its production was expedited by having several animation houses working simultaneously on different segments.|$|E
25|$|The general {{importance}} of Abelard lies in his having fixed more decisively than anyone before him the scholastic manner of philosophizing, with {{the object of}} giving a formal, rational expression to received ecclesiastical doctrine. Though his particular interpretations may have been condemned, they were conceived in essentially <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirit</b> as the general scheme of thought afterwards elaborated in the 13th century with approval from {{the heads of the}} Church.|$|E

25|$|Craig's {{original}} plan has not survived {{but it has}} been suggested that it is indicated on a map published by John Laurie in 1766. This map shows a diagonal layout with a central square reflecting a new era of civic Hanoverian British patriotism by echoing the design of the Union Flag. Both Princes Street and Queen Street are shown as double sided. A simpler revised design reflected <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirit</b> in the names of its streets and civic spaces.|$|E
25|$|We {{are able}} to {{apprehend}} and represent nature to ourselves in the successive forms which its development assumes since it is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirit</b> of which we become aware in self-consciousness, though here unconsciously. The variety of its forms is not imposed on it externally, {{since there is no}} external teleology in nature. Nature is a self-forming whole, within which only natural explanations can be sought. The function of Naturphilosophie is to exhibit the ideal as springing from the real, not to deduce the real from the ideal.|$|E
25|$|Garth Jennings {{has stood}} in for Joe {{on a few}} occasions, and taken part in Song Wars in his place. For most of 2010, Andrew Collins and Richard Herring hosted Adam and Joe's morning slot. Collins and Herring {{continued}} {{a few of the}} Adam Joe's features including 'Song Wars' altered to 'Diary Wars' (in which both presenters would read out excerpts from their own teenage diaries), and 'Text the Nation' as 'Text the Station'. Collins and Herring have appealed to listeners to create radio-jingles, this much in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirit</b> as Adam and Joe's feature.|$|E

50|$|These people {{share many}} common {{cultural}} customs with neighboring nations. They share beliefs {{in many of}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirits</b> and deities, although speak different languages. Some spirits are however totally unique {{to one or two}} cultures and are not universally known throughout the Northwest Coast. Each tribe has its own history, practices, and stories. Some origin stories belong to only one specific tribe, while another tribe has its own stories. But many practices, rituals, and ceremonies occur throughout Kwakwaka'wakw culture, and in some cases, neighboring indigenous cultures also.|$|R

25|$|Authors {{occasionally}} forgo claiming authorship, for {{a number}} of reasons. Historically some authors have published anonymously to shield themselves when presenting controversial claims. A key example is Robert Chambers' anonymous publication of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, a speculative, pre-Darwinian work on the origins of life and the cosmos. The book argued for an evolutionary view of life in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirit</b> as the late Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Lamarck had long been discredited among intellectuals by this time and evolutionary (or development) theories were exceedingly unpopular, except among the political radicals, materialists, and atheists - Chambers hoped to avoid Lamarck's fate.|$|E
25|$|The Burning Man festival {{began in}} 1986 at a San Francisco beach party {{and is now}} held in the Black Rock Desert {{northeast}} of Reno, Nevada. Although few participants would accept the hippie label, Burning Man is a contemporary expression of alternative community in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirit</b> as early hippie events. The gathering becomes a temporary city (36,500 occupants in 2005, 50,000+ in 2011), with elaborate encampments, displays, and many art cars. Other events that enjoy a large attendance include the Rainbow Family Gatherings, The Gathering of the Vibes, Community Peace Festivals, and the Woodstock Festivals.|$|E
25|$|With its {{tendency}} toward deformation and dislocation, {{there is also}} an aspect of expressionism and expressionist architecture associated with deconstructivism. At times deconstructivism mirrors varieties of expressionism, neo-expressionism, and abstract expressionism as well. The angular forms of the Ufa Cinema Center by Coop Himmelb(l)au recall the abstract geometries of the numbered paintings of Franz Kline, in their unadorned masses. The UFA Cinema Center also would make a likely setting for the angular figures depicted in urban German street scenes by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. The work of Wassily Kandinsky also bears similarities to deconstructivist architecture. His movement into abstract expressionism and away from figurative work, is in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirit</b> as the deconstructivist rejection of ornament for geometries.|$|E

50|$|When in 1901 Rabbi Yitzchak Yaacov Reines {{and other}} of Mohilever's disciples re-established the organization, {{they did so}} with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> stance, <b>spirit</b> and name.

25|$|The last {{period was}} really victorious for NAER MATARON. We {{composed}} the harshest and most extreme music {{we ever had}} for our new album. So the next big step was taken, as we are now proud to announce our signing to Season of Mist. We are more strong and enthusiastic than ever before and feel that we are also supported henceforth in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirit.</b> To this point, we wish to extend our salute to the hordes that supported our black metal war machine throughout the last 13 years and especially thank Michael and Season of Mist for giving us the chance to deliver {{what will be the}} most extreme and uncompromising work of NAER MATARON to date.|$|E
25|$|Poincaré {{states that}} {{mathematics}} (analysis) and physics are in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirit,</b> {{that the two}} disciplines share a common aesthetic goal and that both can liberate humanity from its simple state. In a more pragmatic way, the interdependence of physics and mathematics is similar to his proposed relationship between intuition and analysis. The language of mathematics not only permits one to express scientific advancements, but also {{to take a step}} back to comprehend the broader world of nature. Mathematics demonstrates the extent of the specific and limited discoveries made by physicists. On the other hand, physics has a key role for the mathematician - a creative role since it presents atypical problems ingrained in reality. In addition, physics offers solutions and reasoning - thus the development of infinitesimal calculus by Isaac Newton within the framework of Newtonian mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Because {{there was}} the law forbidding Jamiat Kheir to open school {{branches}} in other cities with the same name, people then established schools with different names (although sametimes similar, especially in Arabic) but with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirit</b> {{and most of them}} affiliated with the Jamiat Kheir in Batavia, such as al-Jamʻiyyah al-Khairīyah al-ʻArabiyah in Ampel, al-Mu’awanah in Cianjur, al-ʻArabiyah al-Islamiyah in Banyuwangi, and Shama'il Huda in Pekalongan. The Shama'il Huda school in Pekalongan was led by Muḥammad al-ʻIdroos. Like Jamiat Kheir, this school also hired teachers from the Middle East such as Shaikh Ibrahīm of Egypt. A year later the management changed, where ʻAbdullah al-Aṭṭas was appointed as the Principal, Muḥammad Salim al-Aṭṭas as the vice Principal, Hasan ʻAli al-Aṭṭas as Secretary, and Naṣr ʻAbdullah Bakri as Treasurer. The member of counsel consisted of Hasan ʻAlwi Shahāb, ʻIdroos Muḥammad al-Jufri, Saqqaf Jaʻfar al-Saqqaf, Muḥammad ʻUmar Abdat, Cik Saleh Ismaʻil, ʻAbdulqadir Hasan, Sālim ʻUbaidah and Zen Muḥammad Bin Yaḥya. The schools were not exclusive to Arab Indonesians only, but also many of the pupils were of indigenous Indonesians.|$|E

500|$|Douglas Harper, {{historian}} {{and founder of}} the Online Etymology Dictionary, defines kelpie as [...] "the Lowland name of a demon {{in the shape of a}} horse". It is the most common water spirit in Scottish folklore, but the name is attributed to several different forms in narratives recorded throughout the country. The late 19th century saw the onset of an interest in transcribing folklore, but the recorders were inconsistent in spelling and frequently anglicised words, which could result in differing names for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirit.</b>|$|E
500|$|The leaders {{met again}} {{late on the}} evening of 23 September—a meeting which {{stretched}} into the early morning hours. Hitler demanded that fleeing Czechs in the zones to be occupied take nothing with them. He extended his deadline for occupation of the Sudetenland to 1 October—the date he had long before secretly set for the invasion of Czechoslovakia. The meeting ended amicably, with Chamberlain confiding to Hitler his hopes {{they would be able to}} work out other problems in Europe in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spirit.</b> Hitler hinted that the Sudetenland fulfilled his territorial ambitions in Europe. Chamberlain flew back to London, saying [...] "It is up to the Czechs now." ...|$|E
