500|$|Harry and the Potters {{with its}} strong persona or theme {{is as much}} a {{performance}} art project as it is a rock band. Musically, they sound much like other indie rock music with the exception that the band adheres to a novel conceit: the Harry Potter books will inspire the lyrics. As Joe said in a 2005 interview, [...] "We try to take the themes from the books and amplify them." [...] Their musical sound is described as [...] "simple, catchy rock – <b>think</b> <b>The</b> <b>White</b> Stripes crossed with Raffi – where everyone sings along which is easy because in songs like 'Voldemort Can't Stop the Rock' the title is pretty much the only line." [...] Another reviewer’s ear hears [...] "a touch of the Ramones in their ultra simple lyrics." ...|$|E

It is now eleven.|$|R

[...] "The {{white women}} are safe at present, but if, as <b>the</b> Sahib <b>thinks,</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> {{soldiers}} should beat the {{troops of the}} Nana, who can say what will happen?

As I went by {{the gate of the}} Canonico's little garden, the flowers saluted me with a breath of perfume,--I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> honey- suckle was first to offer me this politeness,--and the dumpy little statues looked far more {{engaging}} than usual.|$|E
6000|$|Lumley, I may remark, {{made use}} of Salamander as an interpreter, until {{he found that the}} dialect of those Indians was not very {{different}} from that to which he had been accustomed. Then he dispensed with his services, and took up the conversation himself, to the obvious astonishment as well as respect of the Indians, who seemed to <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> chief had actually picked up a new language after listening to it for only half an hour! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Haven't {{you done}} yet!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I am shocked, uncle, to {{interrupt}} you again--but these horrid hats of Arnold's are beginning to weigh upon my mind. On reconsideration, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> hat with the low crown is the most becoming of the two. Change again, dear. Yes! the brown hat is hideous. There's a beggar at the gate. Before I go quite distracted, I shall give him the brown hat, and have done with the difficulty in that manner. Am I {{very much in the}} way of business? I'm afraid I must appear restless? Indeed, I am restless. I can't imagine what is the matter with me this morning." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I know not, Roger. I {{have already}} {{sent off to}} the mainland, to fetch a leech famous for his skill {{in the use of}} herbs.

6000|$|... "Your {{people at}} Delhi have beaten back the Sepoys several times, and at Lucknow they resist stoutly. The Nana is very angry {{that the place}} has not been taken, but from what I hear the intrenchments there are much {{stronger}} than they were here, and even here they were not taken by the sword, but because the whites had no shelter from the guns, and could {{not go to the}} well without exposing themselves to the fire. At Lucknow they have some strong houses in the intrenchments, and no want of anything, so they can only be captured by fighting. Everyone says they cannot hold out many days longer, but that I do not know. It does not seem to me that there is any hope of rescue for them, for even if, as you <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> troops should beat Nana Sahib's men, they never could force their way through the streets of Lucknow to the intrenchments there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will {{be frank}} with you, Deliverer," [...] {{answered}} the high-priest, when Juanna had translated his question, [...] "since the truth cannot hurt me, for {{now we know}} too much of one another's secrets to waste time in bandying lies. I know, for instance, that the Shepherdess and the dwarf are no gods, but mortal like ourselves; {{and you know that}} I have dared to affront the true gods by changing the victim whom they had chosen. The sacrifice has been accomplished, but with so many signs and wonders that I am bewildered; the People of the Mist are bewildered also, so that none know what to <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> <b>white</b> man, your companion, was hurled fainting into the waters when the dawn had broken upon the mountain and was seen to be grey; but the dwarf, your servant, did not wait to have that office done for him, for he sprang thither himself, ay, and took one with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our {{days were}} thus spent in silent and lonely occupations. It was only at night {{that we would}} gather {{together}} before the fire and be sociable. I was a novice, and used to listen with open eyes and ears to the strange and wild stories told by the old hunters, and believed everything I heard. Some of their stories bordered upon the supernatural. They believed that their rifles might be spellbound, {{so as not to}} be able to kill a buffalo, even at arms-length. This superstition they had derived from the Indians, who often <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> hunters have laid a spell upon their rifles. Miller partook of this superstition, and used to tell of his rifle's having a spell upon it; but it often seemed to me to be a shuffling way of accounting for a bad shot. If a hunter grossly missed his aim he would ask, 'Who shot last with this rifle?'--and hint that he must have charmed it. The sure mode to disenchant the gun was to shoot a silver bullet out of it.|$|E

5000|$|Tenet {{followed}} the CIA release {{with a new}} statement of his own {{saying that it was}} [...] "ridiculous to <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House would give me such and order and even more ridiculous to think that I would carry it out". He added that {{as the head of the}} CIA he had [...] "consistently fought with some Administration officials to prevent them from overstating the case for Iraqi involvement in international terrorism".|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would be}} of no use on board," [...] the Prince said, [...] "but assuredly you could be of use in {{carrying}} messages, and letting me know frequently, from your own report, how matters are going on. I heard yesterday that the Fan Fan is now fitted out. You shall take the command of her. I {{will give you a}} letter to the boatswain, who is at present in charge, saying that I have placed her wholly under your orders. You will, of course, live on board. You will be chiefly at Chatham and Sheerness. If you call early to-morrow I will have a letter prepared for you, addressed to all captains holding commands in the White Squadron, bidding them to acquaint you, whensoever you go on board, with all particulars of how matters have been pushed forward, and to give you a list of all things lacking. Then, twice a week you will sail up to town, and report to me, or, should there be any special news at other times, send it to me by a mounted messenger. Mr. Pepys, the secretary, is a diligent and hard-working man, but he cannot see to everything, and Albemarle so pushes him that I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Squadron does not get a fair share of attention; but if I can go to him with your reports in hand, I may succeed in getting what is necessary done." ...|$|E
6000|$|Turning from folk-lore to savage beliefs, {{we learn}} that {{from one end of}} Africa to another the honey-bird, schneter, is said to be an old woman whose son was lost, and who pursued him till she was turned into a bird, which still shrieks his name, [...] "Schneter, Schneter".(1) In the same way the manners of most of the birds known to the Greeks were {{accounted}} for by the myth that they had been men and women. Zeus, for example, turned Ceyx and Halcyon into sea-fowls because they were too proud in their married happiness.(2) To these myths of the origin of various animals we shall return, but we must not forget the black and white Australian pelican. Why is the pelican parti-coloured?(3) For this reason: After the Flood (the origin of which is variously explained by the Murri), the pelican (who had been a black fellow) made a canoe, and went about like a kind of Noah, trying to save the drowning. In the course of his benevolent mission {{he fell in love with}} a woman, but she and her friends played him a trick and escaped from him. The pelican at once prepared to go on the war-path. The first thing to do was to daub himself white, as is the custom of the blacks before a battle. They <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> pipe-clay strikes terror and inspires respect among the enemy. But when the pelican was only half pipe-clayed, another pelican came past, and, [...] "not knowing what such a queer black and white thing was, struck the first pelican with his beak and killed him. Before that pelicans were all black; now they are black and white. That is the reason."(4) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! has he {{not seen}} that the woods were filled with {{outlying}} parties of the enemies, and that the Serpent could not steal through them without being seen? Then, did he not lose his path to blind {{the eyes of the}} Hurons? Did he not pretend {{to go back to his}} tribe, who had treated him ill, and driven him from their wigwams like a dog? And, when we saw what he wished to do, did we not aid him, by making a false face, that the Hurons might <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> man believed that his friend was his enemy? Is not all this true? And when Le Subtil had shut the eyes and stopped the ears of his nation by his wisdom, did they not forget that they had once done him wrong, and forced him to flee to the Mohawks? And did they not leave him on the south side of the river, with their prisoners, while they have gone foolishly on the north? Does not Renard mean to turn like a fox on his footsteps, and to carry to the rich and gray-headed Scotchman his daughters? Yes, Magua, I see it all, and I have already been thinking how so much wisdom and honesty should be repaid. First, the chief of William Henry will give as a great chief should for such a service. The medal[16] of Magua will no longer be of tin, but of beaten gold; his horn will run over with powder; dollars will be as plenty in his pouch as pebbles on the shore of Horican; and the deer will lick his hand, for they will know it to be vain to fly from the rifle he will carry! As for myself, I know not how to exceed the gratitude of the Scotchman, but I--yes, I will--" ...|$|E
5000|$|The Game is {{an example}} of ironic {{processing}} (also known as the [...] "White Bear Principle"), in which attempts to avoid certain thoughts make those thoughts more persistent. There are early examples of ironic processing: in 1840, Leo Tolstoy played the [...] "white bear game" [...] with his brother, where he would [...] "stand in a corner and not <b>think</b> of <b>the</b> <b>white</b> bear". Fyodor Dostoyevsky mentioned the same game in 1863 in the essay Winter Notes on Summer Impressions.|$|R

He creates nuisance and both of them are arrested. When they come out of the station, Tamil goes for a second interview but his Visa gets rejected and scolds his grandfather amidst a large crowd in public.|$|R
500|$|The Boston Globe {{described}} Ben's diverse {{customers as}} [...] "punk-looking kids and fashionable business people {{and everyone in}} between". In 2001, Ben and Virginia's son, Kamal, commented on the changes of what types of people were eating at the establishment: [...] "You hear comments. Even <b>the</b> <b>white</b> customers. They want to <b>think</b> they're <b>the</b> only <b>whites</b> who'd been hip {{enough to go to}} the Chili Bowl. Now they look around {{and there are a lot}} of other whites and they are not so happy about it." ...|$|R

As a contrast, distinctly. For her 'youth,' 'audacity,' 'vigour,' and 'swift {{directness}} of purpose,' read 'elderly,' 'timid,' 'feeble,' and 'nervously shilly-shallying,' and you will get something of what I meant him to be. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Rabbit should wear spectacles.

5000|$|Unlike {{yellow and}} brown people, the white does not usually believe {{he can get}} {{attention}} from matter or objects. The yellow and brown believe {{for the most part}} (and it is all a matter of consideration) that rocks, trees, walls etc. can give them attention. The white man seldom believes this and so is likely to become anxious about people.Thus the white saves people, prevents famine, flood, disease and revolution for people as the only purveyors of attention are scarce. The white goes further. He often believes he can get attention only from whites and that yellow and brown peoples' attention is worthless. Thus the yellow and brown races are not very progressive but by and large, saner. And the white race is progressive but more frantic. The yellow and brown races do not understand white concern for [...] "bad conditions" [...] since what is a few million dead men? There are plenty of identities and there is plenty of attention, they <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> <b>white</b> can't understand them. Nor can they understand the white.|$|E

But they were terribly long and pointed nails. So long and cruel they were, though <b>the</b> <b>white</b> fattish hands were not cruel but gentle. And though he trembled with cold and fright to <b>think</b> of <b>the</b> cruel long nails and of the high whistling sound of the cane and of the chill you felt {{at the end of}} your shirt when you undressed yourself yet he felt a feeling of queer quiet pleasure inside him to <b>think</b> of <b>the</b> <b>white</b> fattish hands, clean and strong and gentle. And he thought of what Cecil Thunder had said: that Mr Gleeson would not flog Corrigan hard. And Fleming had said he would not because it was best of his play not to. But that was not why ...|$|R

No, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> only thing to be done, as far as I can see, is that you should go down {{from time to time to}} let us know how things are going.

You may be sure that when the troops started from the town news was sent at once to the leaders, and it is likely that they will move a great number of men down to oppose them, and will likely enough drive them back. However, the great thing for us is to know where they are and what they are doing. It is likely that now <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> have advanced there will no longer be any watch kept to prevent people, in hiding like ourselves, from going down to the town; if you find out that that is so, we will put madame on her barrow again, and carry her down.
