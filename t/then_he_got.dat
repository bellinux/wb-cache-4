5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E

[...] To reflect his transition into adulthood and the changes in his music, Songz changed his appearance by cutting off his trademark braids. Songz also began dressing in more sophisticated attire, trading in sneakers and T-shirts for vests, tailored pants, and [...] "tasteful" [...] shoes. On the appearance change, Songz's mentor, producer, {{and the head of}} Songbook Entertainment, Troy Taylor said, [...] "Trey's from the streets, he's a hood kid. He wasn't glamorous and (didn't have) the finer things in life growing up, [...] He didn't want to lose his street-ism, [...] As he grew into it I think he began to realize, 'Wait a minute, this ain't that bad after all,' and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the ladies' opinions." ...|$|E

Kerthialfad smote this man too his death blow at once, and so on one after the other all who stood near him. Then Earl Sigurd called on Thorstein the son of Hall of Sida, to bear the banner, and Thorstein was just about to lift the banner, but then Asmund the White said, [...] "Don't bear the banner! For all they who bear it get their death." [...] "Hrafn the Red!" [...] called out Earl Sigurd, [...] "bear thou the banner." [...] "Bear thine own devil thyself," [...] {{answered}} Hrafn. Then the earl said, [...] "`Tis fittest that the beggar should bear the bag;'" [...] and with that he took the banner from the staff and put it under his cloak. A little after Asmund the White was slain, and then the earl was pierced through with a spear.|$|E

2500|$|According to William's brother Walter, {{their father}} [...] "tried many things. For some {{time he was}} in very low water; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> up again and settled in a quiet office. He was not a pushing man, nor did he know how to catch at opportunities. Mostly he waited. Meanwhile, he was a studious man, whose chief delight was in reading... He was never in the least degree moved by the Calvinistic {{fanaticism}} of the time... Although regular in attendance at Church, he never ventured to present himself at Holy Communion." ...|$|E

Following three years at TCD, Gerard held some positions in North America before being appointed in Cork, where he was again within close reach of Trevor from the West family home in Midleton. Trevor encouraged Gerard to organise international research meetings in Cork, of which there were quite a few, and Trevor {{was always in the}} thick of them.|$|E
2500|$|At Oslo, Skaat {{explained}} to the press that [...] "Milim" [...] is about loss, such as in a break-up, but that for him, it has a deeper meaning. Skaat said, [...] "this song touches me deeply. My grandfather died {{just days before the}} selections in Israel, and this gives me a very deep feeling, I feel that I'm really singing this song for him. He wanted me to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest for five years, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> to hear that I was going {{to take part in the}} national selection before he passed away." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{review was}} {{subsequently}} {{picked up by}} journalist Robert Matthews, who wrote an article for The Sunday Telegraph, 14 March 1999, claiming that [...] "the {{rise and fall of}} the peppered moth, is based on a series of scientific blunders. Experiments using the moth in the Fifties and long believed to prove the truth of natural selection are now thought to be worthless, having been designed to come up with the 'right' answer." [...] Majerus regarded this view as surprising, and not one that would be shared by those involved in the field. He noted numerous scientific inaccuracies, misquotations and misrepresentations in the article, but thought this was common in press reports. He stated that he had spoken to Matthews for over half an hour and had to explain many details as Matthews hadn't read the book, but [...] "Even <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> nearly everything wrong." ...|$|E
