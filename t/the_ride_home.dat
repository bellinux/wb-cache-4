5|$|Bianca tells Whitney she {{is moving}} to Milton Keynes with her partner Terry Spraggan (Terry Alderton), and wants her to move with them and the children. Although {{originally}} agreeing, Lee persuades her to stay and she moves into the pub with the Carters. Lee develops depression, and when Whitney finds out, she struggles to support him at his lowest points. At Mick's stag party before his wedding to Linda, Lee knocks himself unconscious and is carried upstairs by Mick and Whitney. Whitney confesses to Mick that she intends to break up with Lee after the wedding, unable to handle his depression. However, she is unaware that Lee has overheard her via the baby monitor. On {{the day of the}} wedding, Lee goes missing and Whitney and Mick find him drunk at the park. Lee tells Whitney that he blames himself for her wanting to break up with him, and she promises him that they will work things out. Whitney later thanks Mick for helping her with Lee, but accidentally kisses him on the lips in the process. While Mick and Linda are on their honeymoon, Whitney invites Ryan back to Walford to see Lily, but while at the pub, he steals the cash from the safe, causing Whitney and Nancy to fight, just as Mick and Linda walk in on them. The next morning, Whitney contacts Ryan and he asks to meet in the park. Mick accompanies Whitney and assures a scared Ryan that he can trust him. It then emerges that Whitney told Mick that Ryan killed Rob, so Whitney and Mick convince Ryan to return the money and hand himself to the police, and Whitney will back him up in the hope of him being charged with manslaughter instead of murder, to which Ryan agrees. Whitney shares an emotional goodbye with Ryan as he heads into the police station. On <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>home</b> from the police station, an upset Whitney tells Mick that she has feelings for him and kisses him again. Mick tells Linda what happened, so Linda tells her to stay away from Mick and not to give up on Lee. Whitney later visits Ryan in prison, stating that she is worried about Lee. When she accidentally says Mick's name, he guesses that she has feelings for Mick, which she denies. He then urges Whitney to help Lee, so she gets him a job interview at a local pub, however this causes major grievances between Lee and Nancy. Whitney is forced by Babe to tell Lee about her kissing Mick, and although Nancy tells her to move out, Lee's response is to propose marriage.|$|E
500|$|In September 1978, Joy Division {{made their}} {{television}} debut performing [...] "Shadowplay" [...] on So It Goes, with an introduction by Wilson {{in which he}} misidentified Sumner, and not Hook, as being from Salford. In October, Joy Division contributed two tracks recorded with producer Martin Hannett to the compilation double-7" [...] EP A Factory Sample, the first release by Tony Wilson's record label, Factory Records. In the NME review of the EP, Paul Morley hailed the band as [...] "the missing link between Elvis Presley and [...] the Banshees". Joy Division joined Factory's roster, after buying themselves {{out of the deal}} with RCA. Rob Gretton was made a partner of the label so as to represent the interests of the band. On 27 December, Ian Curtis had his first recognisable epileptic episode. During <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>home</b> after a show at the Hope and Anchor pub in London, Curtis experienced an epileptic seizure and was taken to a hospital. In spite of his illness, Joy Division's career progressed. He appeared on the cover of 13 January 1979 issue of the NME following the persistence of music journalist Paul Morley. That month the band recorded their first session for BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. According to Deborah Curtis, [...] "Sandwiched in between these two important landmarks was the realization that Ian's illness was something we would have to learn to accommodate".|$|E

60|$|But {{few words}} were spoken by Lane or Mel on <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>home.</b> Mel seemed {{lost in a}} trance. She had one hand slipped under Lane's arm, the other clasped over it. As for Lane, he had {{overestimated}} his strength. A deadly numbness attacked his nerves, and he had almost lost the sense of touch. When they arrived at Mel's home the snow-storm had abated somewhat, and the lighted windows of the cottage shone brightly.|$|E
60|$|The slow {{return to}} the tavern, {{dressing}} {{and going to the}} station, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>home,</b> the arrival at the training-house, the close-pressing, silent companionship of Reddy Ray, Worry, and Raymond--these were dim details of that day of calamity. Ken Ward's mind was dead--locked on that fatal moment when he pitched a low ball to MacNeff. His friends left him in the darkness of his room, knowing instinctively that it was best for him to be alone.|$|E
60|$|Helga {{had so much}} {{to think}} about, that <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>home</b> {{appeared}} very short. Her father and mother were delighted to see her, as they did not feel sure that so ugly and cross-looking a man as Habogi might not have played her some cruel trick. And after they had given her some supper they begged her to tell them all she had done. But Helga only told them that they should see for themselves on the third day, when they would come to her wedding.|$|E

6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>ride</b> <b>home</b> {{was made}} mainly in silence. [...] "Oh, the splendid silence!" [...] the woman kept saying in her heart. [...] "Oh, the splendid moonlight, the {{marvelous}} radiance!" [...] Everywhere a heavenly serenity--not a footstep, not a bell, not a cry, not a cracking tree--nothing but vivid light, white snow dappled and lined with shadows, and trees etched against a starlit sky. Splendor {{of light and}} sheen and shadow. Wide wastes of snow so white the stumps stood like columns of charcoal. A night of Nature's making when she is tired of noise and blare of color.|$|E
60|$|He {{tried to}} {{remember}} all that had passed the day before at the picnic, and whether Alice had done or said anything to encourage him, {{and he could not}} find that she had. All her trust and freedom was because she felt perfectly safe with him from any such disgusting absurdity as he had been guilty of. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> <b>home</b> through the mist, with its sweet intimacy, that parting which had seemed so full of tender intelligence, were parts of the same illusion. There had been nothing of it on her side from the beginning but a kindliness which he had now flung away for ever.|$|E
60|$|But I am anticipating now the purport of our {{conversation}} on <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>home</b> instead of first marrying Caddy. We all went to church, and Mr. Jellyby gave her away. Of the air with which old Mr. Turveydrop, with his hat under his left arm (the inside presented at the clergyman like a cannon) and his eyes creasing themselves up into his wig, stood stiff and high-shouldered behind us bridesmaids during the ceremony, and afterwards saluted us, I could never say {{enough to do it}} justice. Miss Wisk, whom I cannot report as prepossessing in appearance, and whose manner was grim, listened to the proceedings, as part of woman's wrongs, with a disdainful face. Mrs. Jellyby, with her calm smile and her bright eyes, looked the least concerned of all the company.|$|E

6000|$|What Mr. Riggs {{wanted to}} do, {{at the third}} large tea given by Mrs. Gilson for Miss Claire Boltwood, was to sneak out on the sun-porch and play over the new records on the phonograph; but the things he had heard from Mrs. Riggs the last time he'd done that had {{convinced}} {{him that it was}} not a wise method of escape. So he stood by the fireplace--safe on one side at least--and ate lettuce sandwiches, which he privately called [...] "cow feed," [...] and listened to a shining, largely feminine crowd rapidly uttering unintelligible epigrams from which he caught only the words, [...] "Ripping hand--trained nurse--whipcord--really worth seeing--lost the ball near the second hole--most absurd person--new maid--thanks so much." [...] He was hoping that some one would come around and let him be agreeable. He knew that he stood <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> <b>home</b> with Mrs. Riggs much better after he had been agreeable to people he didn't like.|$|E
60|$|After {{this the}} {{conversation}} became general, and at length they all {{returned to the}} house to partake of the Doctor's hospitality, who promised to dine at the hall on the morrow. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> <b>home</b> was agreeable and animated, but the conversation {{on the part of the}} ladies was principally maintained by Lady Annabel, who seemed every moment more delighted with the society of Lord Cadurcis, and to sympathise every instant more completely with his frank exposition of his opinions on all subjects. When they returned to Cherbury, Cadurcis remained with them as a matter of course. An invitation was neither expected nor given. Not an allusion was made to the sports of the field, to enjoy which was the original purpose of his visit to the abbey; and he spoke of to-morrow as of a period which, as usual, was to be spent entirely in their society. He remained with them, as on the previous night, to the latest possible moment. Although reserved in society, no one could be more fluent with those with whom he was perfectly unembarrassed. He was indeed exceedingly entertaining, and Lady Annabel relaxed into conversation beyond her custom. As for Venetia, she did not speak often, but she listened with interest, and was evidently amused. When Cadurcis bade them good-night Lady Annabel begged him to breakfast with them; while Venetia, serene, though kind, neither seconded the invitation, nor seemed interested one way or the other in its result.|$|E
