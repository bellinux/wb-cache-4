5|$|The oldest, {{on which}} most {{currently}} available drug therapies are based, is the cholinergic hypothesis, which proposes <b>that</b> <b>AD</b> {{is caused by}} reduced synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The cholinergic hypothesis has not maintained widespread support, largely because medications intended to treat acetylcholine deficiency have not been very effective. Other cholinergic effects have also been proposed, for example, initiation of large-scale aggregation of amyloid, leading to generalised neuroinflammation.|$|E
25|$|Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), {{the most}} common form of dementia, have been studied {{extensively}} as far as priming goes. Results are conflicting in some cases, but overall, AD patients show decreased priming effects on word-stem completion and free association tasks, while retaining normal performance on lexical decision tasks. These results suggest <b>that</b> <b>AD</b> patients are impaired in any sort of priming task that requires semantic processing of the stimuli, while priming tasks that require visuoperceptual interpretation of stimuli are unaffected by Alzheimers.|$|E

25|$|According to Gordon Fletcher, Keynes' General Theory {{provided}} a conceptual justification for New Deal-type policies which was {{lacking in the}} established economics of the day. This was immensely significant, as {{in the absence of}} a proper theoretical underpinning there was a danger <b>that</b> <b>ad</b> hoc policies of moderate intervention would be overtaken by extremist solutions, as had already happened in much of Europe. However, Keynes did not agree with all aspects of the New Deal; he considered that the almost immediate revival of business activity after the program's launch could only be accounted for by dangerous-to-rely-on psychological factors, such as the boost to confidence effected by Roosevelt's inspiring oratory.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{ran against}} San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein for the Democratic {{nomination}} for the United States Senate in the 1992 special election {{to fill the}} Senate seat vacated by Pete Wilson who was elected Governor of California in 1990. The race is often cited {{as an example of}} Davis' history of negative campaign tactics. The Davis campaign featured an ad that compared Feinstein to the incarcerated hotelier Leona Helmsley. Some experts consider <b>that</b> <b>ad</b> to be the most negative in state history. The ad backfired with Davis losing to Feinstein by a significant margin for the nomination although this loss did not stop Davis from using negative campaign ads in the future, including in his race for lieutenant governor. Davis blamed his campaign managers for the defeat and vowed not to let major decisions in future campaigns be decided by his campaign staff. In 2003, when Feinstein urged voters to vote no during the recall election, she was constantly reminded through questions, video and the media about the 1992 primary.|$|E

500|$|McCain's {{campaign}} {{fell into}} early debt; his wife began loaning him {{tens of thousands}} of dollars to keep it alive. [...] Donations also came in from Jim Hensley and other Hensley & Co. executives, but the amounts grew large enough that the Federal Election Commission forced some of it to be returned. [...] By the close of the primary, McCain was able to outspend his opponents; more of than half of his primary expenditures were financed by the eventual $167,000 that his wife lent to the campaign. [...] (The McCains had made a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; they would always keep their finances apart and file separate income tax returns. [...] In the end, $93,000 of the 1982 loan would be forgiven.) [...] The spending advantage made itself felt in television advertising, including a highly effective two-minute mini-documentary that presented him as new leader for Arizona with a record of service to the country.

40|$|How {{effective}} are candidate, party, {{and interest}} group ads at conveying noticeable differ-ences between the Democratic and Republican Parties? Or at boosting preferences for the par-ties? There are two conflicting expectations; first, <b>that</b> <b>ads</b> from these three sponsors {{will have the}} same effect on citizen perceptions, under the assumption that viewers do not notice spon-sorship. The second expectation is <b>that</b> party <b>ads</b> have a stronger effect on perceived party differences (that is, at “building the party image”) than candidate and group ads. There have been very few empirical investigations into these common claims, however. I leverage a com-prehensive dataset <b>that</b> tracks political <b>ads</b> in the nation’s top media markets on surveys of U. S. voters in 2000 and 2004. The results demonstrate that sponsorship does matter, but not in ways that confirm the second expectation. When ads convey party distinctions, the effect comes from candidate ads (and to a lesser extent, from interest group ads); to <b>that</b> effect, party-sponsored <b>ads</b> almost never matter. 1...|$|R

40|$|Alcoholic drinks (ADs) {{have been}} {{reported}} as a migraine trigger in {{about one-third of the}} migraine patients in retrospective studies. Some studies found <b>that</b> <b>ADs</b> trigger also other primary headaches. The studies concerning the role of ADs in triggering various types of primary headaches published after the International Headache Society classification criteria of 1988 were reviewed, and the pathophysiological mechanisms were discussed. Many studies show <b>that</b> <b>ADs</b> are a trigger of migraine without aura (MO), migraine with aura (MA), cluster headache (CH), and tension-type headache (TH). While data on MO and CH are well delineated, those in MA and TH are discordant. There are sparse reports <b>that</b> <b>ADs</b> are also triggers of less frequent types of primary headache such as familial hemiplegic migraine, hemicrania continua, and paroxysmal hemicrania. However, in some countries, the occurrence of alcohol as headache trigger is negligible, perhaps determined by alcohol habits. The frequency estimates vary widely based on the study approach and population. In fact, prospective studies report a limited importance of ADs as migraine trigger. If ADs are capable of triggering practically all primary headaches, they should act at a common pathogenetic level. The mechanisms of alcohol-provoking headache were discussed in relationship to the principal pathogenetic theories of primary headaches. The conclusion was that vasodilatation is hardly compatible with ADs trigger activity of all primary headaches and a common pathogenetic mechanism at cortical, or more likely at subcortical/brainstem, level is more plausible...|$|R

2500|$|Traditionally, English {{followed}} Latin usage {{by placing}} the [...] "AD" [...] abbreviation before the year number.

The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a century or millennium, as in [...] "fourth century AD" [...] or [...] "second millennium AD" [...] (although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions). Because BC is the English abbreviation for Before Christ, it is sometimes incorrectly concluded <b>that</b> <b>AD</b> means After Death, i.e., {{after the death of}} Jesus. However, this would mean that the approximate 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would not be included in either of the BC and the AD time scales.|$|E
