Rowe {{received}} around $10million in a settlement, which started with an immediate payment of $1.5million. With the divorce, Rowe gave Jackson full custody rights to her children. At the time, both Rowe and Jackson requested privacy {{and asked the}} public not to speculate on <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> divorce.

5|$|The {{first people}} {{to write about the}} May Revolution were {{participants}} who wrote memoirs, biographies and diaries. However, their works were motivated by purposes other than historiographic ones, such as to explain <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> actions, clean their public images, or express their support or rejection of the public figures and ideas of the time. For example, Manuel Moreno wrote the biography of his brother Mariano as propaganda for the revolutions in Europe, and Cornelio Saavedra wrote his autobiography at a moment when his image was highly questioned, to justify himself to his sons.|$|E
5|$|French authors like Franck Marie (1978), Pierre Jarnac (1985), (1988), Jean-Luc Chaumeil (1994), {{and more}} {{recently}} Marie-France Etchegoin and Frédéric Lenoir (2004), Massimo Introvigne (2005), Jean-Jacques Bedu (2005), and Bernardo Sanchez Da Motta (2005), have never taken Plantard and the Priory of Sion as seriously as Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh. They eventually concluded {{that it was all}} a hoax, outlining in detail <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> verdict, and giving detailed evidence that the Holy Blood authors had not reported comprehensively. They imply that this evidence had been ignored by Lincoln, Baigent, and Leigh to bolster the mythical version of the Priory's history that was developed by Plantard during the early 1960s after meeting author Gérard de Sède.|$|E
5|$|The general {{election}} {{resulted in a}} victory for Tony Blair's Labour Party, which adopted a pro-EU stance. Their victory was considered a landslide, thus making the Referendum Party's role in the election fairly irrelevant. The Conservatives had gained only 30.7% of the vote, a drop from the 41.9% they had attained in 1992 and the lowest vote share that they had received since the establishment of modern British party politics in 1832. Their representation in the House of Commons fell by over half, from 343 to 165; their lowest representation in the House since 1906. <b>The</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> electoral decline were many {{and the impact of}} the Referendum Party was not a major factor.|$|E

25|$|The Dorians invaded Greece from Epirus and Macedonia {{at the end}} of the 2nd {{millennium}} BC (circa 1100–1000 BC), though <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> migration are obscure. The region's original inhabitants {{were driven}} southward into the Greek mainland by the invasion and by the early 1st millennium BC three principal clusters of Greek-speaking tribes emerged in Epirus.

25|$|Justice O’Connor {{rejected}} the County of Riverside’s claims that “allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct {{and likely to}} be redressed by the requested relief.”; they argued the plaintiffs who were arrested and held without probable cause determination were suffering direct injury (emotional) {{because they were not}} given <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> arrest. The ruling stated that any suspects that are arrested without a warrant by law enforcement have to know why they are being arrested (determination of probable cause) from a judge within 48 hours, except by emergency circumstances.|$|E

After being in Elvis' employment for two decades, both Red West and Sonny West were only paid a few weeks' severance pay. Their requests to speak directly to Elvis about their employment termination and the nominal severance pay were not granted. Red West, Sonny West, and Elvis himself felt betrayed, and all parties were upset with one another {{in the manner in which}} they were fired.|$|E
25|$|Albert Andrew Muwalo Gandale Nqumayo (1927 – 1977) was a {{prominent}} politician in Malawi from the 1960s until he lost power in 1976 and was executed in 1977. He entered politics in the mid 1950s through involvement in a hospital worker's trade union and membership of the Nyasaland African Congress, where his activities led to his detention without trial during the 1959 State of Emergency in Nyasaland. After his release, he joined the Malawi Congress Party (MCP), and became locally prominent in Ntcheu District as district MCP chairman and from 1962 as Member of Parliament for Ntcheu South. In 1963, he became Administrative Secretary of the MCP, and he was {{a prominent}} supporter of the then-Prime Minister, Hastings Banda during the Cabinet Crisis of 1964. Muwalo was rewarded for his loyalty with the cabinet post of Minister of Information in 1964, and in 1966 he became Minister of State in the President's Office. His close contact with Banda, both as minister in Banda's office and in the MCP gave him great power and, {{during the first half of}} the 1970s he and his relative, the Head of the Police Special Branch Focus Gwede, were heavily involved in the political repression of actual or suspected opponents of the Banda regime. In 1976 he and Gwede were arrested: <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> arrests were unclear, but may have resulted from a power struggle among those around the ageing president or simply because he became too powerful and may have been seen by Banda as a threat. In 1977, the two were tried before a Traditional Court and after a trial whose fairness was in serious doubt, were both sentenced to death. Gwede was reprieved, but Muwalo was hanged on 3 September 1977.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, Sesame Street {{had been on}} the air for over 20 years and was, as author Michael Davis put it, [...] "the undisputed heavyweight {{champion}} of preschool television". [...] The show's dominance began to be challenged throughout the decade by other television shows for preschoolers such as Barney & Friends, by the growth of the children's home video industry, and by the increase of thirty-minute children's shows on cable. [...] Sesame Street's ratings declined, so the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), the organization responsible for putting the show on the air, responded by researching <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> lower ratings.|$|E
500|$|Donen's {{relationship}} with Gene Kelly was complicated {{and he often}} spoke bitterly about his former friend and mentor decades after they worked together. Kelly was never explicitly negative about Donen in later years. However, Silverman has asserted that Kelly's comments were often condescending and demonstrated [...] "a long-standing attempt to diminish Donen's contributions to their collective work." [...] <b>The</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> conflict were both personal (both men married dancer Jeanne Coyne) and professional (Donen always felt that Kelly did not treat him as an equal). They disagreed over who deserved more credit for their joint projects: three films as co-directors and four as co-choreographers.|$|E
