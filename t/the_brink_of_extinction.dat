In 1931, as the Javan rhinoceros was on <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> in Sumatra, {{the government of the}} Dutch East Indies declared the rhino a legally protected species, which it has remained ever since. A census of the rhinos in Ujung Kulon was first conducted in 1967; only 25 animals were recorded. By 1980, that population had doubled, and has remained steady, at about 50, ever since. Although the rhinos in Ujung Kulon have no natural predators, they have to compete for scarce resources with wild cattle, which may keep their numbers below the peninsula's carrying capacity. Ujung Kulon is managed by the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry. Evidence of at least four baby rhinos was discovered in 2006, the most ever documented for the species.|$|E

50|$|With {{deforestation}} having claimed much suitable habitat already, {{the giant}} antpitta {{is classified as}} vulnerable species by the IUCN. Between 2000 and 2004, it had been uplisted to endangered status, as it was feared that habitat destruction was accelerating in the few areas where the birds were known to exist. This turned out less bad than assumed, and the species was downlisted again in 2004. Still, it considered threatened under criteria B1a+b(i,ii,iii) and C2a(i). This means that the species is known from less than 10 locations (a total of 1,900 square kilometers), with habitat continuing to decline in quality and quantity and some subpopulations on <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> complete <b>extinction.</b> Also, it is estimated to number less than 2,500 mature birds, with less than 1,000 in any one subpopulation.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, {{there were}} at least 800 mature birds; it is {{estimated}} that the remaining habitat allows for a carrying capacity of maybe 50-150 more (BirdLife International 2006a,b). They occur in the remaining forests of the island, especially in the Black River Gorges region. The species was downlisted to vulnerable by the IUCN in 1994 as releases of captive-bred birds became unnecessary. Little conservation action was deemed necessary only two decades - in Mauritius kestrel terms, a long lifetime or maybe 4-5 generations - after the species had stood at <b>the</b> very <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinction.</b> Today, apart from routine monitoring to be able to assist individual couples that fail to establish breeding territories for lack of nesting facilities - a major limiting factor, the ongoing control of introduced predators is basically all that is being done to assist the species' survival (BirdLife International 2006a,b).|$|R
5|$|In the 1940s, the Siberian tiger was on <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinction</b> {{with only}} about 40 animals {{remaining}} in the wild in Russia. As a result, anti-poaching controls {{were put in place}} by the Soviet Union and a network of protected zones (zapovedniks) were instituted, leading to a rise in the population to several hundred. Poaching again became a problem in the 1990s, when the economy of Russia collapsed. The major obstacle in preserving the species is the enormous territory individual tigers require (up to 450km2 needed by a single female and more for a single male). Current conservation efforts are led by local governments and NGO's in concert with international organisations, such as the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Wildlife Conservation Society. The competitive exclusion of wolves by tigers has been used by Russian conservationists to convince hunters to tolerate the big cats. Tigers have less impact on ungulate populations than do wolves, and are effective in controlling the latter's numbers. In 2005, there were thought to be about 360 animals in Russia, though these exhibited little genetic diversity. However, in a decade later, the Siberian tiger census was estimated from 480 to 540 individuals.|$|E

From one wet season to the next, fish were unable to reach traditional locations to repopulate when water was withheld by the C Birds were forced to fly farther from their nests to forage for food. By the 1970s, bird numbers had decreased 90%. Many of the birds moved to smaller colonies in the WCAs to be closer to a food source, making them more difficult to count. Yet they remain significantly fewer in number than before the canals were constructed.|$|E

40|$|How to Draw a Rhinoceros, {{the first}} book of poems by Canadian writer, scholar, and lawyer Kate Sutherland, mines centuries of {{rhinoceros}} representations in art and literature to document the history of European and North American encounters with the animal—from the elephant–rhinoceros battles staged by monarchs in the Middle Ages; the rhinomania that took hold in France and later in Italy {{in response to the}} European travels of Clara the ‘Dutch’ Rhinoceros in the mid- 1700 s; the menageries and circuses of the Victorian era; the exploits of celebrated twentieth-century hunters like Teddy Roosevelt and Ernest Hemingway; and the trade in rhinoceros horn artefacts that thrives online today. Along the way, it explores themes of colonialism, animal welfare, and conservation. Sutherland was inspired on this poetic path by Clara, an eighteenth-century rhinoceros she first encountered in porcelain form in an exhibit of ceramic animals at Toronto’s Gardiner Museum. This chance experience set her off on a grand quest to learn all she could of Clara’s story, and resulted in a collection that combines Robert Kroetschian documentary poetics with the meticulous research and environmental passion of Elizabeth Kolbert, to successfully examine the centuries-long path of the rhinoceros that’s brought it to <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> global <b>extinction.</b> [URL]...|$|R

Its mature fruit is completely covered by the accrescent hypanthium, whereas Beilschmiedia (and the tribe Perseeae) {{is characterized by a}} completely deciduous perianth. Since it does not fit well with any of the existing lauraceous genera, a new genus, Dahlgrenodendron J. J. M. v. d. Merwe & Van Wyk, and new combination, D. natalense (J. H. Ross) J. J. M. v. d. Merwe & Van Wyk, are proposed. The pollen is most distinctive and decidedly different from anything known in Lauraceae. Grains are free, radially symmetrical, para-isopolar, ± spindle-shaped prolate (when dry), atreme, with a wall ornamentation of striae alternating with prominent±parallel ridges. Dahlgrenodendron is further characterized by opposite leaves, fruit with an endocarp consisting of a palisade of columnar sclereids which develop from the ovary wall, and 2 -celled anthers. It is tentatively related to the tribe Cryptocaryeae, subtribe Cryptocaryineae and compared with Cryptocarya R. Br. and Ravensara Sonn. — the two genera currently constituting this subtribe.

Location Ogasawara (Japan), Hawaii (USA), Great Barrier Reef (Australia), Florida (USA), Tortuguero (Costa Rica). Methods We compiled seasonal nesting activity data from all reliable continuous long-term studies (> 25 years), which comprised data series for six of the world's major green turtle rookeries. We estimated the underlying time-specific trend in these six rookery-specific nester or nest abundance series using a generalized smoothing spline regression approach. Results Estimated rates of nesting population increase ranged from c. 4 - 14 % per annum over the past two to three decades. These rates varied considerably among the rookeries, reflecting the level of historical exploitation. Similar increases in nesting population were also evident for many other green turtle stocks that have been monitored for shorter durations than the long-term studies presented here. Main conclusions We show that six of the major green turtle nesting populations in the world have been increasing over the past two to three decades following protection from human hazards such as exploitation of eggs and turtles. This population recovery or rebound capacity is encouraging and suggests that the green turtle is not on <b>the</b> <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> global <b>extinction</b> even though some stocks have been seriously depleted and are still below historical abundance levels.

40|$|Abstract The Gelao {{languages}} {{constitute the}} most diverse group of the Kra branch, in the Kra-Dai (or Tai-Kadai) language family (Edmondson n. d.). No more than 6, 000 Gelao speakers are scattered across the southwestern Chinese provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan, as well as Hà Giang province, northern Vietnam, despite there being approximately half a million ethnic Gelao living mostly in Guizhou. New data of various Gelao varieties from {{the past several years}} has now made it possible to classify the Gelao languages much more precisely, owing mostly to recent fieldwork carried out by Li Jinfang 李锦芳 and his graduate students. Lexical evidence from my comparative database of about 100 vocabulary items of 15 Gelao varieties suggests that there are three main branches of Gelao, namely (1) Red Gelao (including A’ou, Mulao, and Vandu), (2) White Gelao (Telue), and (3) Central Gelao (Hakei and Qau). Red Gelao has the most internal diversity, while White Gelao displays the least internal variation. Central Gelao consists of the two closely related varieties Hakei (Green Gelao) and Qau (Sinicized Gelao), as suggested by Yumay Shen (2003). Historical and linguistic evidence strongly indicate a Gelao homeland in western Guizhou, where ethnic Gelao lived alongside speakers of the divergent Austroasiatic languages Bolyu and Bugan, as well as the little-known Caijia and Longjia languages. However, further fieldwork remains highly urgent for all Gelao languages, especially Red Gelao, for which some varieties are now at <b>the</b> very <b>brink</b> <b>of</b> <b>extinction.</b> In August 2012, I discovered only one living speaker of Houzitian 猴子田 Red Gelao, namely Guo Yunxiu 郭云秀 (88) of Langdai Township 郎岱镇, Liuzhi Special District, Guizhou. Houzitian, of which I had seen data of only several words prior to my field trip, is distinct enough to be mutually unintelligible with all other Gelao varieties, and is most closely related to Hongfeng Red Gelao and Mulao. I was also only able to locate one speaker of Red Gelao each in the townships of Shajing 沙井乡, Qianxi County 黔西县, Guizhou, and Tiechang 铁厂乡, Malipo County, Yunnan...|$|R
