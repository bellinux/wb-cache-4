25|$|Superstitious beliefs {{surrounding}} death entail {{the sudden}} appearance of certain animals, particularly <b>those</b> <b>black</b> in color. Examples are: {{the appearance of}} a lingering black butterfly around an individual is an omen that a person's next of kin has died; a sick person heading toward hospital who sees a black-hued cat will not survive their condition; seeing an owl near the home of a sick individual signifies the infirm's imminent death.|$|E
25|$|Calgary Stampeders – First to wear third uniforms {{when they}} {{introduced}} black alternates with red numerals in 1994 on September 6 against Edmonton. They {{were the first}} team to wear alternates during a playoff game and the first to wear alternates during a Grey Cup game, which they did in the 86th Grey Cup in 1998. <b>Those</b> <b>black</b> jerseys were retired following the Grey Cup win and new black alternates with white numerals were unveiled in 1999 that were worn until 2004. They first wore black pants with the black jerseys on October 18, 2002 at home vs. the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. The third version of black uniforms were worn on Labour Day in 2005 and were last worn on September 2, 2013. 2011 {{was the first time the}} Stampeders wore black helmets with the black uniforms. The Signature series uniforms were first worn, also on Labour Day, for the 2014 season and again in 2015 and 2016. They were also worn for home playoff games in all three years too. Since 1994, the Stampeders have worn black on Labour Day 14 times.|$|E

2500|$|Essentially, the Court’s disingenuous {{statement}} about the record in Hodges rests on its refusal to presume that all animus against blacks stemmed from their past condition of slavery.

2500|$|The Rhodesian Front's {{victory in}} the 1962 general {{election}} and the subsequent UDI were in the populist tradition of Rhodesian politics. The early history of Rhodesian politics was very much one of electoral uprisings by miners, industrial workers and farmers against the big business establishment that dominated the colony. The election of the Reform Party government led by Godfrey Huggins in 1933 {{had a great deal}} in common with the RF win in 1962. It has been argued that the racial dimension of UDI was an incidental thing. Economic recessions in the early 1930s and the early 1960s had both produced the election of populist governments committed to securing standards of living for working people (albeit, the immediate concern was for working white people). It is significant that in the 1962 election, the RF recruited a slate of black candidates to contest the district (essentially B roll) seats. <b>Those</b> <b>black</b> RF candidates obtained little support from the B roll electorate and none were elected.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the species}} {{described}} in [...] was [...] "Papilio ecclipsis". This {{was based on a}} specimen sent by William Charlton to James Petiver in 1702, who wrote: [...] "It exactly resembles our English Brimstone Butterfly (R. Rhamni), were it not for <b>those</b> <b>black</b> spots and apparent blue moons on the lower wings. This is the only one I have seen." [...] Carl Linnaeus examined the butterfly, and named it Papilio ecclipsis in Centuria Insectorum Rariorum, including it in his [...] from the 12th edition (1767) onwards. It was not until 1793 that the hoax was discovered by Johan Christian Fabricius, who recognised that the dark patches had been painted on, and that the specimen was a common brimstone butterfly (now called Gonepteryx rhamni). Although the curator at the British Museum [...] "indignantly stamped the specimen to pieces" [...] when he found out, William Jones created two replicas to replace the lost specimen.|$|E
2500|$|In 1946, as {{pressure}} was building from Malan's reactionary National Party, Smuts sought {{to devise a}} comprehensive United Party position on the so-called native question. For this purpose he appointed the independent Native Laws Commission, with Fagan as its head, to investigate changes to the system of segregation. When the Commission reported in 1948, it stated that the total segregation or apartheid envisaged by the National Party was [...] "utterly impracticable", since South Africa's racial groups were inevitably interdependent, and the 'reserves' set aside for black South Africans were far too small to support them. It therefore recommended that 'influx control' measures be relaxed, allowing black South Africans to move to cities with relative freedom and the incremental integration of the races. Yet the report did not favour racial equality, and rejected the full social or political integration of black people as unacceptable. It recommended liberalisation primarily {{on the basis that}} it would benefit the white population economically, and recommended accordingly that only <b>those</b> <b>black</b> persons who would benefit industry should be allowed to stay in the cities.|$|E

2500|$|Lorde's work {{on black}} {{feminism}} {{continues to be}} examined by scholars today. [...] Jennifer C. Nash examines how black feminists acknowledge their identities and find love for themselves through those differences. [...] Nash cites Lorde, who writes, [...] "I urge {{each one of us}} here to reach down into that deep place of knowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any difference that lives there. See whose face it wears. Then the personal as the political can begin to illuminate all our choices." [...] Nash explains that Lorde is urging black feminists to embrace politics rather than fear it, which will lead to an improvement in society for them. [...] Lorde adds, [...] "Black women sharing close ties with each other, politically or emotionally, are not the enemies of Black men. Too frequently, however, some Black men attempt to rule by fear <b>those</b> <b>Black</b> women who are more ally than enemy." [...] Lorde’s 1979 essay “Sexism: An American Disease in Blackface” is a sort of rallying cry to confront sexism in the black community in order to eradicate the violence within it. Lorde insists that the fight between black women and men must end in order to end racist politics.|$|E
