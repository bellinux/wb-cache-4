500|$|Meanwhile, other crewmen {{fought to}} {{maintain}} vital services as water continued {{to pour into}} the ship below decks. The engineers and firemen worked to vent steam from the boilers {{to prevent them from}} exploding on contact with the cold water. They re-opened watertight doors in order to set up extra portable pumps in the forward compartments in a futile bid to reduce the torrent, and kept the electrical generators running <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>lights</b> and power throughout the ship. Steward F. Dent Ray narrowly avoided being swept away when a wooden wall between his quarters and the third-class accommodation on E deck collapsed, leaving him waist-deep in water. Two engineers, Herbert Harvey and Jonathan Shepherd (who had just broken his left leg after falling into a manhole minutes earlier), died in boiler room No.5 when, at around 00:45, the bunker door separating it from the flooded No.6 boiler room collapsed and they were swept away by [...] "a wave of green foam" [...] according to leading fireman Frederick Barrett, who barely escaped from the boiler room.|$|E

50|$|Much of {{the rest}} of the ship was taken up by storage (for oil and the like) and crew accommodations.

5000|$|For {{more than}} 80 years, the red-and-white striped tower was manned by three {{lighthouse}} keepers.

5000|$|Dungeon Master II {{received}} mediocre {{reviews and}} sold poorly.

40|$|Background: Alcohol {{withdrawal}} delirium is {{the most}} serious manifestation of alcohol withdrawal. Evidence suggests that appropriate care improves mortality, but systematic reviews are unavailable. Methods: Articles with original data on management of alcohol withdrawal delirium underwent structured review and meta-analysis. Results: Meta-analysis of 9 prospective controlled trials demonstrated that sedative-hypnotic agents are more effective than neuroleptic agents in reducing duration of delirium and mortality, with a relative risk of death when using neuroleptic agents of 6. 6. Statistically significant differences among various benzodiazepines and barbiturates were not found. No deaths were reported in 217 patients from trials using benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Conclusions: Control of agitation should be achieved using parenteral rapid-acting sedative-hypnotic agents that are cross-tolerant with alcohol. Adequate doses should be used <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>light</b> somnolence for the duration of delirium. Coupled with comprehensive supportive medical care, this approach is highly effective in preventing morbidity and mortality...|$|R

50|$|Some {{lamp types}} contain a little neon, which permits {{striking}} at normal running voltage, with no external ignition circuitry. Low pressure sodium lamps operate this way.

50|$|Recommended {{training}} {{for older adults}} is {{three times a week}} of light strength training exercises. Exercise machines are a commonly used equipment in a gym setting, including treadmills with exercises such as walking or light jogging.

50|$|Like most {{types of}} {{inversion}}, subject-verb inversion {{is a phenomenon}} that challenges theories of sentence structure.

Such sentences are more consistent with a theory that takes sentence structure to be relatively flat, lacking a finite verb phrase constituent, i.e. lacking the VP of S → NP VP.|$|R
5000|$|For king bettas, always dim {{lighting}} and aquatic vegetation like Microsorum pteropus and Taxiphyllum barbieri is advised.

40|$|The growth {{characteristics}} of microalgae under different light conditions (continuous or intermittent) are essential information for photobioreactor design and operation. In this study, we constructed a thin-layer (10 mm) flat plate photobioreactor device with a light/dark (L/D) alternation system {{to investigate the}} growth of Spirulina platensis under two different light regimes: (1) continuous illumination {{in a wide range}} of light intensities (1. 00 - 77. 16 mW cm(- 2)); (2) intermittent illumination in medium frequency (0. 01 - 20 Hz). Specific growth rate and light efficiency based on biomass production were determined for each round of experiment. Four regions (light limited region, intermediate region, light saturated region and light inhibition region) were recognized according to the results under continuous illumination. Under intermittent illumination, when L/D frequency increased from 0. 01 Hz to 20 Hz, specific growth rate and light efficiency were enhanced. However, the enhancement was different, depending on the applied light intensity and light fraction. The higher the light intensity, the greater the enhancement would be when L/D frequency increased from 0. 01 Hz to 20 Hz; and the higher the light intensity, the lower the light fractions is needed <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>light</b> efficiency as high as that under continuous illumination in light limited region.

40|$|Background: Bariatric surgery rapidly {{improves}} type 2 {{diabetes mellitus}} (T 2 DM). Our objective was to profile and compare the extent and duration of improved glycemic control following Roux-en-Y gastric (RYGB) bypass surgery and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and compare against caloric restriction/weight loss and medical combination therapy based approaches using the Zucker diabetic fatty rat (ZDF) rodent model of advanced T 2 DM. Methods: Male ZDF rats underwent RYGB (n= 15) or SG surgery (n= 10) at 18 weeks of age and received postsurgical insulin treatment as required <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> mid <b>light</b> phase glycemia within a predefined range (10 - 15 mmol/L). In parallel, further groups of animals underwent sham surgery with ad libitum feeding (n= 6), with bodyweight (n= 8) or glycemic matching (n= 8) to the RYGB group using food restriction {{or a combination of}} insulin, metformin and liraglutide respectively. Results: Both bariatric procedures decreased the daily insulin dose required <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> mid <b>light</b> phase blood glucose levels below 15 mmol/L as compared to those required by bodyweight or glycemic matched rats (p < 0. 001). No difference was noted between RYGB and SG with regard to initial efficacy. SG was however associated with higher food intake, weight regain and higher insulin requirements versus RYGB at study end (p < 0. 05). Severe hypoglycemia occurred in several rats after RYGB. Conclusions: RYGB and SG significantly improved glycemic control in a rodent model of advanced T 2 DM. Whilst short-term outcomes are similar, long-term efficacy appears marginally better after RYGB although this is tempered by the increased risk of hypoglycemia...|$|R
50|$|Dofflemeyer Point {{defines the}} eastern side of the {{entrance}} to Budd Inlet, which leads south to Olympia, the state capital. A lens lantern atop a twelve-foot stake was established at the Point in 1887. The present day 30 ft, pyramidal concrete tower, designed by architect Rufus Kindle, replaced the first light in 1934. In the 1960s, the Coast Guard automated the Dofflemyer Point Lighthouse, using photoelectric cells to turn the light on and off. However, a contract keeper was still required <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> the <b>light</b> and tower, and to activate the fog signal when needed. The lighthouse was fully automated in 1987 and a radio-beacon, which transmitted a radio signal used in locating a mariner’s position, was installed.|$|R
