The study was undertaken to provide guidance to military planners who are often required to keep abreast of developments in a rapidly changing field of technology. The fact that even the most advanced presently used radar systems in the navy are based on five to ten year-old technology, verifies the need for this study. Microwave Power Modules which combine vacuum tube and Solid State technology have been developed and have demonstrated advanced performance characteristics. Their advantages, such as very wide bandwidth and ability to operate at much higher ambient temperatures over that of the Solid State devices have opened up new opportunities for their use in Radar systems.

40|$|A novel {{calibration}} method {{has been proposed}} whereby the complete signal path for each <b>transmit</b> and <b>receive</b> <b>module</b> (TRM) is characterized during imaging-like conditions. This characterization includes com-ponents normally contained within an internal calibration loop {{as well as the}} actual transmitting elements. The method utilizes the selectable phase and gain settings in each TRM normally used for focussing antenna beam-patterns. Each signal burst independently switches these TRM settings according to an orthogonal code sequence. During post-processing, the recorded data is decoded using the inverse orthogonal sequence to recover the individual TRM characteristics. With this method, it is possible to fully characterize the TRMs without the standard requirements of an external reference signal and/or an internal calibration loop. This paper illustrates problems associated with the removal of these two aids and how they are overcome. SpeciÂ¯c problem areas such as oscillator and TRM stability are explored.

DLR supported the radiometric and polarimetric calibration of Sentinel- 1 A by the analysis of point target responses of several acquisitions considering different modes (all except wave mode), beams and polarization channels. An elevation dependent bias, which had not been properly predicted by the used antenna model, was found for all investigated modes. Offsets up to 2 dB were determined during the SAR instrument calibration phase, in particular for low and high elevation angles.

40|$|Tensegrity structures- {{dynamically}} stable systems {{consisting of}} disjoint rigid elements (rods) connected by tensile elements (strings) - are an intriguing robotic platform {{due to their}} relatively high strength-to-weight ratio, resilience to deformation, and collapsability.

This will offer a view to the hidden content of e. g. packets or bags without the need to open them, whereby packaging and content will not be damaged. Nowadays X-ray is used, but as the millimeter-wave quantum energy is far below the ionization energy, it is less harmful for the human health.

The MMIC receiver consists of a modified square-slot antenna, a three-stage low-noise amplifier, and a sub-harmonically pumped resistive mixer with on-chip local oscillator frequency multiplication chain. The transmitter chip is the dual of the receiver chip by inverting {{the direction of the}} RF amplifier. The chips are mounted on 5 -mm silicon lenses in order to interface the antenna to the free space and are packaged into two separate modules. The double-sideband noise figure (NF) and conversion gain of the receiver module are measured with the -factor method. The total noise temperature of 1310 Â± 100 K(corresponding to an NFof 7. 4 dB), including the losses in the lens and antenna, is measured at 2 20 GHz with a respective conversion gain of 3. 5 dB. The radiated continuous-wave power from the transmitter module is measured to be up to - 6 dBm from 212 to 226 GHz.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} novel {{idea of using}} {{evolutionary}} algorithms to optimise control and design aspects of active array antenna systems. Active arrays differ from most mechanically scanned antennas in that they offer {{the ability to control}} the shape of their radiation pattern. As active arrays consist of a multiplicity of <b>transmit</b> and <b>receive</b> <b>modules</b> (TRMs), the task of optimally controlling them in order to generate a desired radiation pattern becomes difficult. The control problem is especially true of conformal (non-planar) array antennas that require additional phase control to achieve good radiation pattern performance. This thesis describes a number of significant advances in the optimisation of array antenna performance. Firstly a genetic algorithm (GA) is shown to be effective at optimising both planar and conformal antenna performance. A number of examples are used to illustrate and promote the basic optimisation concept. Secondly, in this thesis the techniques are advanced to apply multiobjective evolutionary optimisation algorithms to array performance optimisation. It is shown that Evolutionary Algorithms allow users to simultaneously optimise many aspects of array performance without the need to fine-tune a large number of weights. The multiple-objective analysis methods shown demonstrate the advantages to be gained by holding knowledge of the Pareto optimal solution set. Thirdly, this thesis examines the problems of optimising the design of large (many element) array antennas. Larger arrays are often divided into smaller sub-arrays for manufacturing reasons and to promote formation of difference beam patterns for monopulse operation. In the past, the partitioning has largely been left to trial-and-error or simple randomisation techniques. This thesis describes a new and novel approach for optimally subdividing both planar and conformal array antennas as well as improving gain patterns in a single optimisation process. This approach contains a new method of partitioning array antennas, inspired from a biological process and is also presented and optimised using evolutionary algorithms. Additionally, the technique can be applied to any size or shape of array antenna, with the processing load dependent on the number of subarrays, rather than the number of elements. Finally, the success of these new techniques is demonstrated by presenting a range of performance optimised examples of planar and conformal array antenna installations including examples of optimally evolved subarray partitions...|$|R
