40|$|Processes {{determining}} {{the fate of}} organic contaminants in the subsurface are often characterized by non-equilibrium conditions. This habilitation treatise explores the kinetic characteristics of the processes influencing the fate of organic contaminants in the subsurface employing computational-, laboratory- and field experiments. In the first part, release and transport processes of hydrophobic contaminants from multicomponent non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) are examined in 5 individual studies. These comprise {{a review of the}} literature on the fate of contaminants at manufactured gas plants, laboratory experiments and modeling of the release kinetics of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from aged and fresh tar phases, and a field study of a crude oil contaminated aquifer employing geophysical, hydrogeochemical and microbiological methods. The second part comprises three studies, which explore transport and degradation kinetics of hydrophilic compounds, which are used as deicing chemicals at airports. In this part, a laboratory percolation experiment was evaluated with a numerical model and the degradation of the deicing chemicals propylene glycol and formate under field conditions was characterized in lysimeters, employing, among other methods, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). The studies show that multiple interdependencies exist between contaminant transport time-scales and time-scales of mobilization and degradation. Solubilization of PAHs from <b>tar</b> <b>oils</b> was diffusionally highly restricted with extremely long equilibration times. Hydrophobic compounds are often subject to mobilization and transport as colloids, which was observed in all experimental studies with aged NAPLs. Degradation kinetics of deicing chemicals were found to be dependent on a dynamic reaction of the biomass in column experiments and did not agree with first-order kinetics. The field lysimeter experiments showed that the ratio of degradation time-scale to transport time-scale determines the fate of propylene glycol. As a consequence, non-equilibrium transport conditions resulted in rapid discharge of large amounts of propylene glycol from the topsoil. The results have consequences for experimental procedures aiming for process identification and parameter quantification of mobilization, transport and degradation of organic contaminants. For a realistic estimation of risk of exposure, natural attenuation and biological remediation, experimental and numerical evaluation including transport conditions is inevitable...|$|E

40|$|The {{hydrogen}} and oxygen isotopes of water and the carbon isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from different aquifers at an industrial site, highly contaminated by organic pollutants representing residues of the former gas production, {{have been used as}} natural tracers to characterize the hydrologic system. On the basis of their stable isotope compositions as well as the seasonal variations, different groups of waters (precipitation, surface waters, groundwaters and mineral waters) as well as seasonably variable processes of mixing between these waters can clearly be distinguished. In addition, reservoir effects and infiltration rates can be estimated. In {{the northern part of the}} site an influence of uprising mineral waters within the Quaternary aquifers, presumably along a fault zone, can be recognized. Marginal infiltration from the Neckar River in the cast and surface water infiltration adjacent to a steep hill on the western edge of the site with an infiltration rate of about one month can also be resolved through the seasonal variation. Quaternary aquifers closer to the centre of the site show no seasonal variations, except for one borehole close to a former mill channel and another borehole adjacent to a rain water channel. Distinct carbon isotope compositions and concentrations of DIC for these different groups of waters reflect variable influence of different components of the natural carbon cycle: dissolution of marine carbonates in the mineral waters, biogenic, soil-derived CO 2 in ground- and surface waters, as well as additional influence of atmospheric CO 2 for the surface waters. Many Quaternary aquifer waters have, however, distinctly lower delta(13) C(DIC) values and higher DIC concentrations compared to those expected for natural waters. Given the location of contaminated groundwaters at this site but also in the industrially well-developed valley outside of this site, the most likely source for the low C- 13 (DIC) values is a biodegradation of anthropogenic organic substances, in particular the <b>tar</b> <b>oils</b> at the site...|$|E
40|$|Den polyzyklischen aromatischen Kohlenwasserstoffen (PAK) kommt bei Schadensfaellen bzw. Altlasten von Kokereien oder ehemaligen Gaswerken eine besondere Bedeutung zu, da sie zu den Hauptinhaltsstoffen von Teeroelen gehoeren. Zudem weisen viele PAK toxische, karzinogene, mutagene und teratogene Eigenschaften auf. Wichtige Faktoren fuer die Ausbreitung der PAK in der wassergesaettigten Bodenzone sind deren Sorptions- und Desorptionsverhalten. Dieses Verhalten haengt von sehr unterschiedlichen schadstoff- und bodenspezifischen Parametern ab. Die Sorption der PAK ist konzentrationsabhaengig und damit nicht ueber alle Konzentrationsbereiche linear. Bis ca. fuenf Prozent der Wasserloeslichkeit des jeweiligen PAK laesst sich die Verteilung der PAK zwischen der festen und der fluessigen Phase mit einem linearen Verteilungskoeffizienten (K_d) beschreiben. Danach nimmt unter statischen Bedingungen die Sorptionsneigung zunaechst stark ab, bis die PAK ab 40 - 60 % der Wasserloeslichkeit schliesslich wieder verstaerkt vom Boden festgehalten werden, wo sie in einer Art kristalliner Form vorliegen. Dieser Bereich laesst sich nur mit nichtlinearen Sorptionsmodellen, wie z. B. dem BET-Modell, beschreiben. Die Sorption der PAK ist zum groessten Teil abhaengig vom Gehalt an organischem Material. Die Art der organischen Substanz beeinflusst das Sorptionsverhalten, so dass junges (rezentes) organisches Material weniger sorbiert als altes (fossiles). Mit steigendem Oktanol/Wasser-Verteilungskoeffizienten (K_o_w) des PAK nimmt dieser Einfluss ab. Die spezifische Oberflaeche hat bei der Sorption nur bei extrem geringen Gehalten an organischer Materie einen messbaren Einfluss, der mit steigendem K_o_w zunimmt (hydrophobe Sorption). Die Zeit zur Einstellung des Sorptionsgleichgewichts ist bei PAK laenger als bisher angenommen. Sie wird stark beeinflusst von der Art und Weise, wie das Bodenmaterial und die organische Substanz vorliegen. (orig. /SR) Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAH) {{are of particular}} interest in hazardous waste sites produced by coking plants or former gas works {{because they are the}} main constituent of <b>tar</b> <b>oils.</b> In addition, they are considered toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic. Important factors controlling the transport of PAH in the saturated zone are their sorption and desorption behaviour. This, in turn, depends on various contaminant characteristics and subsoil specific parameters. Sorption of PAH depends on their concentration and does not show a linear relationship throughout the concentration ranges. The distribution of PAH between the solid and the liquid phase can be described by a linear distribution coefficient (K_d) for up to approximately 5 % of the solubility of respective PAH. With time and under static conditions the sorption tendency decreases. After the PAH attain 40 - 60 % of their solubility in water they are increasingly adsorbed by the soil, where they exist in a kind of crystalline form. Behaviour of PAH in this solubility range can only be described by non-linear sorption models, e. g. the BET-model. The sorption of PAH is for the most part dependent on the amount of organic material present in soils. The type of organic matter has an influence on the sorption behaviour: young (recent) organic material adsorbs less than older organic material. This influence decreases with an increase in the octanol/water distribution coefficient (K_o_w) of the PAH. The specific surface only has a detectable influence on the sorption in soils with an extremely low amount of organic matter, however, this increase with an increase of K_o_w (hydrophobic sorption). The time needed to adjust to the sorption equilibrium is longer for PAH than assumed up to now. It is affected by the type and manner in which the soil and organic material are present.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to assess the}} {{relevance}} of NSO-heterocycles in the groundwater of three tar oil contaminated sites and furthermore to search for indications for the presence of natural attenuation processes including the group of NSO-heterocycles. Therefore, as a first step, analytical methods were developed. In addition to an existing HPLC-DAD method for the detection of a huge number of NSO- heterocycles, an LC-MS-MS method for a selective and sensitive analysis of N- heterocycles as well as a Headspace-GC-MS method for the analysis of volatile analogs was performed. The site-directed survey allowed the long distance comparison of the concentration of various NSO-heterocycles. Differences in distribution and decrease over the field sites using mass loads were discussed in context to compounds physicochemical characteristics to work out indications for microbial natural attenuation processes of NSO-heterocycles. N-heterocycles like quinoline compounds were found in high concentrations near the source of contamination at all of the three sites. In comparison to S- and O-heterocycles a higher decrease of quinoline compounds with the flow line of groundwater was observed. Methylsubstituted S- and O-heterocycles were found of special relevance downstream the source. A comparison of these heterocycles with EPA-PAHs, especially with acenaphthene a persistent PAH, shows the necessity to consider these compounds. To cover indications of biodegradation, degradation studies using contaminated groundwater were performed. In addition, the microbial activity in an on-site column filled with aquifer material and contaminated groundwater was analysed. A high-resolution well provided an insight into the micro distance comparison of the concentration of various contaminants as well as electron acceptors such as sulfate across the fringe and centre zones and therefore a comparison of different contaminants plumes. Indications for the presence of microbial degradation in the plumes fringe could be worked out. Altogether, data of contaminants distribution from groundwater analyses, of decrease in concentration in degradation experiments and of the plumes width in the high-resolution well were critically interpreted. The decrease in concentration along the plumes together with the results from the more artificial degradation experiments and the high-resolution well led to the general conclusion that biodegradative processes towards hetero- and homocycles are present in the aquifers. Especially O- and S-heterocycles as well as their methylated analogs were found of high relevance downstream the source of contamination, and showed persistence in the degradation experiments. Secondly, the possibility to use the formation of anaerobic degradation products for the demonstration of biodegradation at the field sites was investigated. The aim was to explore whether hydroxylated quinoline and isoquinoline or methylquinoline found in high concentrations in the groundwaters can be used as indicator for natural attenuation. Therefore, the degradative potential of aquifer material towards quinoline compounds in single, and the formation of metabolites was studied. Hydroxylated and hydrogenated metabolites were formed in high amounts. However, the analyses of seven tar products showed that 2 (1 H) -quinolinone, 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 (1 H) -quinolinone, 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone and 3, 4 -dihydro- 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone are primary constituents. Therefore, the detection of these in groundwater was found to be a non-sufficient indicator for the occurrence of natural attenuation processes. Instead, the ratio of hydroxylated to parent compound (R-metabolite) was tested as a useful indicator. Parameters which may influence this ratio were studied: Sorption was found to influence both partners of R-metabolite in a minor extend. The main parameter influencing the ratio was found in differences in partitioning of parent and hydroxylated compound between the tar oil and water phase. With respect to the observed partition coefficient between tar oil and water of 3. 5 for quinoline and isoquinoline and 0. 3 for 2 (1 H) -quinolinone and 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone, the ratio in groundwater would be approximately 10 times higher than the ratio in tar oil. When paying attention to these parameters and including a sufficient threshold factor, in a broad number of groundwater samples the highest ratio found in <b>tar</b> <b>oils</b> was clearly exceeded. This indicates that biological processes take place in the aquifer of the three sites and R-metabolite is an applicable indicator for the presence of natural attenuation. The R-metabolite concept was found to be feasible for the couples 2 (1 H) -quinolinone/quinoline, 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 (1 H) -quinolinone/quinoline, 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone/isoquinoline, and also for methylsubstituted quinolines and their hydroxylated metabolites...|$|E

40|$|LC-MS-MS {{analysis}} of groundwater of a <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> contaminated site showed {{the occurrence of}} the N-heterocycles quinoline and isoquinoline {{as well as their}} hydroxylated and hydrogenated metabolites. The concentrations of the hydroxylated compounds, 2 (1 H) -quinolinone and 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone, were significantly higher than those of the nonsubstituted parent compounds. Therefore, exclusive quantification of the parent compounds leads to an underestimation of the amount of N-heterocycles present in the groundwater. Microbial degradation experiments of quinoline and isoquinoline with aquifer material of the site as inocculum showed the formation of hydroxylated and hydrogenated products under sulfate-reducing conditions, the prevailing conditions in the field. However, since analyses of seven tar products showed that these compounds are also primary constituents, their detection in groundwater is found to be a nonsufficient indicator for the occurrence of biological natural attenuation processes. Instead, the ratio of hydroxylated to parent compound (R-metabolite) is proposed as a useful indicator. We found that 65 - 83 % of all groundwater samples showed R-metabolite for 2 (1 H) -quinolinone, 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone, 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 (1 H) -quinolinone, and 3, 4 -dihydro- 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone, which was higher than the highest ratio found in tar products.
