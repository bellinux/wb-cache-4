40|$|We {{show that}} the {{polarization}} of linearly polarized light can be rotated an arbitrary angle by double-layer metal hole array structures in a subwavelength regime. The transmitted light with the rotated polarization, however, remains of nearly the same strength as the incident field at particular frequencies. The mechanism {{can be attributed to}} the subwavelength feature of the rectangular holes, and the <b>tangential</b> <b>guiding</b> modes between layers modulated by the orientation of the holes. The structures have potential applications as polarization rotators in a broad frequency range covering from terahertz (THz) to infrared frequencies. (c) 2012 Optical Society of Americ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a positioning strategy for flank milling ruled surfaces. It is {{a modification of}} a positioning method developed by Bedi et al. [1]. A cylindrical cutting tool is initially positioned tangential to the two boundary curves on a ruled surface. Optimization is used to move these tangential points to di#erent curves on the ruled surface to reduce the error. A second optimization step is used to additionally make the tool tangent to a rule line, further reducing the error and resulting in a tool position where the tool is positioned <b>tangential</b> to two <b>guiding</b> rails and one rule line. The resulting surface has 88 % less under cutting than the Bedi et al. method...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} and characterise particle behaviour in an (observationally-driven) 3 D MHD model of the solar atmosphere above a slowly evolving, non-flaring active region. We use a relativistic guiding-centre particle code to investigate the behaviour of selected particle orbits, distributed throughout a single snapshot of the 3 D MHD simulation. Two distinct particle acceleration behaviours are recovered, which affect both electrons and protons: (i) direct acceleration along field lines and (ii) <b>tangential</b> drifting of <b>guiding</b> centres with respect to local magnetic field. However, up to 40 % of all particles actually experience a form of (high energy) particle trap, because {{of changes in the}} direction of the electric field and unrelated to the strength of the magnetic field; such particles are included in the first category. Additionally, category (i) electron and proton orbits undergo surprisingly strong acceleration to non-thermal energies (â‰² 42 MeV), because of the strength and extent of super-Dreicer electric fields created by the MHD simulation. Reducing the electric field strength of the MHD model does not significantly affect the efficiency of the (electric field-based) trapping mechanism, but does reduce the peak energies gained by orbits. We discuss the implications for future experiments, which aim to simulate non-flaring active region heating and reconnection. Comment: submitted to A&A. 14 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|Texture mapping {{algorithms}} use mesh parameterization {{methods to}} find an optimal map for the vertices of a 3 D model in texture space. These techniques vary in the properties they try to optimize such as stretch and skewness of the texture when mapped onto the surface. While {{most of them do}} well in terms of quality, they tend to be computationally intensive for large mesh models, which limits their use in interactive applications. We propose a greedy alternative that is significantly faster than current algorithms and achieves comparable quality. We use a priority queue to store polygons and use <b>tangential</b> vectors to <b>guide</b> the texture over the surface. Our algorithm is simple to implement and can texture over a million polygons per second on a typical desktop. The algorithm does not impose any constraints on the mesh topology and we do not require the model to be cut into patches before texturing. Stretch and distortion measures are stable across models and are comparable to current algorithms. We also propose a method to generate self tile-able textures for use in conjunction with our texture mapping algorithm. We present qualitative and quantitative results in comparison with several other texture mapping algorithms. The efficiency and robustness of our algorithm makes it useful in interactive modeling applications and texture mapping large mesh models such as heritage monuments...|$|R
