5|$|Gallieni exiled Ranavalona from Madagascar on February 27, 1897, and officially {{abolished}} the monarchy the next day. French officials ordered the queen {{to leave her}} palace at 1:30 in <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>She</b> was carried from Antananarivo by palanquin as the city slept, accompanied by 700–800 escorts and porters. Throughout the days spent traveling to the eastern port of Toamasina where she would board a ship to Réunion, Ranavalona reportedly drank heavily, swigging rum directly from the bottle in an uncustomarily coarse fashion. At Toamasina on March 6, Ranavalona was notified that her sister Rasendranoro and aunt Ramasindrazana would be arriving shortly, as would the queen's fourteen-year-old niece, Razafinandriamanitra, who was nine months pregnant with the illegitimate child of a French soldier.|$|E
5|$|When De Simone's mother, Mary Sedotti, {{discovered}} {{she had not}} returned home by <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>she</b> expressed concern, and her husband Michael, Teresa's stepfather, drove to the pub where he observed DeSimone's car still parked, but did not make any closer investigation. Shortly after 10:00, Anthony Pocock, the landlord of the Tom Tackle, was expecting a commercial delivery to the premises, and believing DeSimone had deliberately left the car overnight he {{decided to try to}} move it to allow the delivery through. Inside he discovered DeSimone's partially clothed body on the back seat. He immediately called the police.|$|E

25|$|Deux Amis left Jersey on 23 May and at 3:30 in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>she</b> hit a rock. Despite {{efforts to}} save her, water entered the ship {{faster than the}} pumps could remove it. After the {{passengers}} left in a boat, Willson decided to run her ashore, which he did. As a result, there were no casualties. While Deux Amis was in distress at sea, local fishing boats came to help; once she ran ashore, the local populace gave priority to plundering rather than rescue. When Captain Green of the North Hants militia heard what was happening, he and his officers sent a strong detachment to enforce order.|$|E
60|$|In <b>the</b> <b>mornings</b> <b>she</b> {{would see}} him as he came fishing to the burn.

25|$|Her {{first period}} of {{education}} was at Liqing primary school. This school {{was one of}} several schools which accepted female students in Putian.

Breese quickly loaded her machine guns and began firing at 07:57. She and many of the other ships in the area were quickly able to mobilize a strong anti-aircraft defense which lasted throughout <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>She</b> was credited with hits on several Japanese aircraft and damaging at least one midget submarine.

Sasa is an innocent, childish girl who does not have many worries aside from her friends' quarrels. She tends to be a handful for her mother, who picks out her clothes for her and even helps her get ready for school in <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>She</b> mentions that if she thinks too hard about something, her brain becomes itchy.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Tilson was the rector of Ditton from 1679–1702 {{and was in}} {{correspondence}} with the Protestant cleric Richard Baxter. In one letter Tilson described how a woman from Rochester had gone to her father's house in West Malling where she died on 4 June 1691. While on her death bed, at two o'clock in <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>she</b> appeared as an apparition to a nurse in Rochester, some nine miles away, where her children were being looked after. It had been the dying woman's wish to see her children before she died {{but she had been}} persuaded not to travel because of her ill health. Baxter included this account in his subsequent book The Certainty of the Worlds of the Spirits published in the same year. Tilson died in 1750 and his memorial in St. Peter's AD Vincula Church records a bequest he made to the poor of [...] "£100 in money, the yearly produce to be distributed annually on the feasts of All Saints and the Purification, in wood and wheat" [...] (see inscription in photograph).|$|E

2500|$|The mare {{was also}} {{believed}} to [...] "ride" [...] horses, which left them exhausted {{and covered in}} sweat by <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>She</b> could also entangle the hair of the sleeping man or beast, resulting in [...] "marelocks", called marflätor ("mare-braids") or martovor ("mare-tangles") in Swedish or marefletter and marefloker in Norwegian. The belief probably originated as an explanation to the Polish plait phenomenon, a hair disease.|$|E

2500|$|Liz has {{a rather}} satirical sense of humor. She has {{frequently}} {{been shown to}} be a stress eater, a trait she shares with Jack. Despite the fact that she often ingests high-amounts of junk food on a daily basis, she seems to keep her weight under control, perhaps because she {{does not seem to have}} proper meals. According to Fey, the character is not bulimic; [...] "she just likes to eat". Liz does have some knowledge of cooking, though she admits to only using her oven to warm her jeans in <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>She</b> is allergic to both dogs and cats, as well as [...] "anything warm and adorable". However, she does believe her allergy to dogs is psychosomatic, as she mentions that a dog bit her during the time of her first period.|$|E
2500|$|Mrs. Phillips holds {{a dinner}} for adults, {{inviting}} Cope to pair with {{the daughter of}} a banking family. Cope disappoints her, reacting to the presence of prominent elders with [...] "a caution that almost became expressiveness."(119) Cope takes ill, nearly faints, and fears he has appeared a weakling. At Mrs. Phillips' insistence he spends the night: [...] "he felt greatly subordinated; he wished that he might have capitulated to a man."(126) When Cope and Amy walk to campus in <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>she</b> thinks it [...] "a privilege...curtailed much too soon,"(129) while he would rather have walked alone. Foster's reaction to Cope's fainting is [...] "as if a shaping ideal had dissipated. Or as if a trace of weakness in one seemingly so young and strong was not altogether unacceptable as a source of consolation."(129) ...|$|E
