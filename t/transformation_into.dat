5|$|The late Republic saw an {{increase}} in the centralisation of power into the hands of provincial governors, the use of military power to enforce political changes (e.g. the Sullan dictatorship), and the use of violence, combined with exploitation of the suitably bribed or intimidated 'sovereign' assemblies, to grant supreme authority to victorious commanders. The increasing legitimisation of violence and centralisation of authority into fewer and fewer men would, with the collapse of trust in the Republic's institutions, put it on a path to civil war and its <b>transformation</b> <b>into</b> the autocratic Roman Empire.|$|E

Their battle is said to have destroyed the Bridge of the Gods and thus created the great Cascades Rapids of the Columbia River.|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for incorporating automatic <b>transformations</b> <b>into</b> {{processes such as}} the application of inference rules, subsumption, and demodulation provides a mechanism for improving search strategies for theorem proving problems arising {{from the field of}} program verification. The incorporation of automatic <b>transformations</b> <b>into</b> the inference process can alter the search space for a given problem, and is particularly useful for problems having broad rather than deep proofs. The technique {{can also be used to}} permit the generation of inferences that might otherwise be blocked and to build some commutativity or associativity into the unification process. Appropriate choice of transformations, and new literal clashing and unification algorithms for applying them, showed significant improvement on several real problems according to several distinct criteria...|$|R

The encantado will often be seen running from a festa, despite protests from the others for it to stay, and can be seen by pursuers as it hurries to the river and reverts to dolphin form. When it is under human form, it wears a hat to hide its blowhole, which does not {{disappear}} with the shapeshift.|$|E

The brigade also activated a new special troops battalion to consolidate the formerly separate engineer, signal and military intelligence elements, and the 1st Squadron, 71st Cavalry to provide reconnaissance for the brigade.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{organization}} of the Roman fleets of late Antiquity, from the gradual break-up of the large provincial fleets into smaller squadrons in the 3rd century to the formation of a new navy at the onset of the Muslim conquests. Despite the evidence of considerable naval activity in this period, earlier scholars believed that the Roman navy had all but vanished by the 4th century, but more recent work has altered this picture towards a <b>transformation</b> <b>into</b> a mainly fluvial and coastal force, designed for close co-operation with the army.|$|E

40|$|A birational map from a {{projective}} space onto a {{not too much}} singular projective variety with a single irreducible non-singular base locus scheme (special birational transformation) is a rare enough phenomenon to allow meaningful and concise classification results. We shall concentrate on transformations defined by quadratic equations onto some varieties (especially projective hypersurfaces of small degree), where quite surprisingly the base loci are interesting projective manifolds appearing in other contexts; for example, exceptions for adjunction theory, small degree or small codimensional manifolds, Severi or more generally homogeneous varieties. In particular, we shall classify: quadro-quadric <b>transformations</b> <b>into</b> a quadric hypersurface; quadro-cubic <b>transformations</b> <b>into</b> a del Pezzo variety; transformations whose base locus (scheme) has dimension at most three.
