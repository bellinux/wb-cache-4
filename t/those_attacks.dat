5|$|Each evening, Texas {{retired from}} her {{bombardment}} position close to Okinawa, but returned {{the next morning}} to resume her bombardments. The enemy ashore, preparing for a defense-in-depth strategy as at Iwo Jima, made no answer. Only air units provided a response, as several kamikaze raids were sent to harass the bombardment group. Texas escaped damage during <b>those</b> <b>attacks.</b> On 1 April, after six days of aerial and naval bombardment, the ground troops went ashore, and for almost two months, Texas remained in Okinawan waters providing gunfire support for the troops and fending off the enemy aerial assault. In performing the latter mission, she claimed one kamikaze kill on her own and claimed three assists. On 14 May she departed Okinawa for the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|On March 5, 1975, the North Vietnamese 2nd Army Corps officially {{commenced}} {{its campaign}} against South Vietnamese forces of I Corps. The opening {{shots of the}} campaign was marked by an attack on South Vietnamese military convoys on Mount Hai Van, {{and the destruction of}} An Lo Bridge on National Highway 1, located north of Huế. Positions held by the ARVN 913th Regional Force at Dong Ong Do and Hill-368 also came under attack, as Phu Bai Airbase was subjected to intense artillery bombardment. While the South Vietnamese were busy dealing with <b>those</b> <b>attacks,</b> General Nguyen Huu An secretly redeployed the 325th Division and the 9th Regiment of the 304th Division, from Quảng Trị towards Huế in the south. The 46th and 271st Regiment then moved into positions previously held by the 325th Division and 9th Regiment. And, to fool South Vietnamese intelligence agencies, the North Vietnamese also moved tank and artillery units to Cua Viet, Thanh Hoi and Ai Tu to cover their main thrust.|$|E
5|$|Operation Igloo White was {{a covert}} United States joint {{military}} electronic warfare operation conducted from late January 1968 until February 1973, during the Vietnam War. These missions {{were carried out}} by the 553d Reconnaissance Wing, a U.S. Air Force unit flying modified EC-121R Warning Star aircraft, and VO-67, a specialized U.S. Navy unit flying highly modified OP-2E Neptune aircraft. This state-of-the-art operation utilized electronic sensors, computers, and communications relay aircraft in an attempt to automate intelligence collection. The system would then assist in the direction of strike aircraft to their targets. The objective of <b>those</b> <b>attacks</b> was the logistical system of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) that snaked through southeastern Laos and was known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail (the Truong Son Road to the North Vietnamese).|$|E

25|$|Since the {{pipeline}} was {{to pass through}} Afghanistan, {{it was necessary to}} work with the Taliban. The U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Robert Oakley, moved into CentGas in 1997. In January 1998, the Taliban, selecting CentGas over Argentinian competitor Bridas Corporation, signed an agreement that allowed the proposed project to proceed. In June 1998, Russian Gazprom relinquished its 10% stake in the project. On 7 August 1998, American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were bombed. The United States alleged that Osama bin Laden was behind <b>those</b> <b>attacks,</b> and all pipeline negotiations halted, as the Taliban's then leader, Mullah Omar, announced that bin Laden had the Taliban's support. Unocal withdrew from the consortium on 8 December 1998, and soon after closed its offices in Afghanistan and Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|The Winnebago War started when, in 1826, two Winnebago {{men were}} {{detained}} at Fort Crawford {{on charges of}} murder and then transferred to Fort Snelling in present-day Minnesota. The Winnebago in the area believed that both men had been executed. On June 27, 1827, a Winnebago war band led by Chief Red Bird and the prophet White Cloud (Wabokieshiek) attacked a family of settlers outside of Prairie du Chien, killing two men. They {{then went on to}} attack two keel-boats on the Mississippi River that were heading toward Fort Snelling, killing two men and injuring four more. Seven Winnebago warriors were killed in <b>those</b> <b>attacks.</b> The war band also attacked settlers on the lower Wisconsin River and the lead mines at Galena, Illinois. The war band surrendered at Portage, Wisconsin, rather than fighting the United States Army that was pursuing them.|$|E
500|$|Acting in {{accordance}} with his vision of a Polish-led [...] "Międzymorze" [...] federation of East-Central European states, Piłsudski on April 22, 1919, issued a bilingual statement, in Polish and Lithuanian, of his political intentions — the [...] "Proclamation to {{the inhabitants of the}} former Grand Duchy of Lithuania", pledging to provide [...] "elections [...] take place on the basis of secret, universal and direct voting, without distinction between the sexes" [...] and to [...] "create an opportunity for settling your nationality problems and religious affairs in a manner that you yourself will determine, without any kind of force or pressure from Poland." [...] Piłsudski's proclamation was aimed at showing good will both to Lithuanians and international diplomats; the latter succeeded as the proclamation dealt a blow to the image of 'Polish conquest' and replaced it with the image of 'Poland fighting with Bolsheviks dictatorship and liberating other nations'; however the Lithuanians who demanded exclusive control over the city were much less convinced. Piłsudski's words also caused significant controversy on the Polish political scene; as they had not been discussed with the Sejm and caused much anger among Piłsudski's National-Democratic opponents; Polish People's Party [...] "Piast" [...] deputies demanded incorporation of the Vilnius Region into Poland and even accused Piłsudski of treason. [...] However, Piłsudski's supporters in the Polish Socialist Party managed to deflect <b>those</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{analyzed}} data {{in the literature on}} the rates of development of parasitoids that parasitize aphids and coccids. The objective was to determine whether their rates of development, as is well documented for ladybirds, are also dependent on that of their prey. The analysis revealed that, like ladybirds, parasitoids that parasitize aphids develop faster than those that parasitize coccids. Parasitoids and ladybird predators show the same pattern in their rates of development: <b>those</b> <b>attacking</b> aphids develop faster than <b>those</b> <b>attacking</b> coccids. This is strong evidence that we are dealing with a general response rather than one specific to ladybirds. It also lends support to the concept that the development rates of these natural enemies are evolutionarily conserved rather than phylogenetically constrained...|$|R

500|$|On April 23, Yankovic {{recorded}} [...] "Christmas at Ground Zero". The song, [...] "a cheery little tune about death, {{destruction and}} the end of the world" [...] was the result of Scotti Brothers Records' insistence that Yankovic release a Christmas record. After Yankovic presented the song to his label, they relented, because it was [...] "a little different from what they were expecting." [...] After the song's release, some radio stations banned the record, a move that Yankovic attributes to [...] "most people [...] to hear about nuclear annihilation during the holiday season." [...] Following the September 11 attacks, when the general term [...] "ground zero" [...] was co-opted as a proper name for the World Trade Center site where two of <b>those</b> <b>attacks</b> took place, the disturbing lyrics caused this song to be banned largely from radio. Yankovic wanted the song to receive a video, but due to budget reasons, his label did not agree. Yankovic, however, directed one himself which was mostly made up of stock footage, with a live action finale that was filmed in an economically devastated part of the Bronx, New York that looked like a bomb had gone off.
