5|$|Norwegian {{control over}} the Faroe Islands and Shetland was strong due to the {{importance}} of Bergen as a trading centre, while Orkney, the Hebrides and Man had more natural <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> the Scottish mainland. Although traditionally having had <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> the community of Norse settlers in northern Scotland, Scottish rulers had increasingly asserted their sovereignty over the entire mainland. Haakon had at the same time gained stronger control of the Hebrides and Man than any Norwegian ruler since Magnus Barefoot. As part of a new development the Scottish king Alexander II claimed the Hebrides and requested to buy the islands from Norway, but Haakon staunchly rejected the proposals. Following Alexander II's death, his son Alexander III continued and stepped up his father's policy by sending an embassy to Norway in 1261, and thereafter attacking the Hebrides.|$|E

5|$|These events {{threatened}} Serbia, {{which had}} severed <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> Catholicism and {{was once again}} fully Orthodox. The marriage alliance between Vladislav and Ivan Asen II may {{be a result of}} the Hungarian threat to both of the rulers' countries. Some scholars have speculated that Vladislav accepted Bulgarian suzerainty, but this speculation has no evidence to support it, since no contemporary sources say that Vladislav recognized Asen as overlord of Serbia. However, Asen likely had the largest influence on the politics of Vladislav. Vladislav seems to have been left out of Orthodox alliance founded by Asen. Vladislav may have been afraid of close <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> Bulgaria, since his brother Radoslav's close <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> the Despotate of Epirus had caused dissatisfaction among the Serbian nobility. This shows that Vladislav was not too dependent upon Bulgaria, as he was not obliged to join the alliance; if he had recognized the suzerainty of Asen, he likely would have forced to join the alliance.|$|E
