5|$|The 2011 Orange Bowl {{kicked off}} at 8:39pm EST on January 3, 2011 in Sun Life Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida. Bowl {{officials}} said 65,463tickets were sold for the game, but many went unused, and that official figure {{was more than}} 9,000 below stadium capacity. The game was televised on ESPN, and the announcers were Mike Tirico, Ron Jaworski, Jon Gruden and Michele Tafoya. An estimated 8.23million viewers watched the broadcast, earning it a Nielsen rating of 7.1. That figure was the second-lowest mark to date for a BCS game. For contributing teams to the Orange Bowl, the Atlantic Coast Conference and Pacific-10 each received {{large amounts of money}} to be divided among their members. Because <b>the</b> <b>Pac-10</b> had two BCS teams, that conference received $27.2million from the BCS. The ACC, which had only Virginia Tech in a BCS bowl, received $21.2million. In the ACC, Virginia Tech received a somewhat larger share of the money as a reward for winning the conference: All other ACC teams received $1.1million; Tech got $1.7million. Stanford received a similar amount, but the extra money was offset by the cost of sending 500 players, coaches, and staff to Miami.|$|E
5|$|The Huskies {{proceeded}} to win 25–0 over Arizona State and 45–22 against the University of Arizona Wildcats, with Tyler scoring once in each game. Washington, although unranked at 7–2, was leading {{in the race}} for <b>the</b> <b>Pac-10</b> spot in the Rose Bowl. Only four other teams in the conference were eligible for the appearance, as, in the previous August, the presidents of Pac-10 schools had voted unanimously to disqualify half of the conference's members from Rose Bowl contention because of rules violations. The teams disqualified included UCLA and USC, two of the league's strongest teams. The next week, despite not having Tyler due to injury, Washington beat USC 20–10; this clinched a spot in Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. In the 1981 Rose Bowl against the Michigan Wolverines, Washington was beaten 23–6. In a scoreless first quarter, it was originally ruled a touchdown when Tyler dove over a pile near the goal line. After the officials conferred, however, it was decided that Tyler had fumbled at the one-yard line, which he later admitted to.|$|E
