40|$|For {{this short}} {{programme}} I have selected {{a series of}} works which reconfigure the relationship between text and image through {{the form of the}} voice. This is achieved by a disjointed marriage of the spoken and written word, a new narrative formed through a sequential collage of film titles woven together by voiceover, or a cinematic re-enactment of a voice recording. In each, there is a gap between the voice and what appears on screen, an unspoken awareness of a friction between these two formal elements. In Secondary Currents, 1982 - 90, Peter Rose parodies the complexity of the discussion surrounding the relationship between text and film, creating ‘a kind of comic opera’. Rose describes the work as ‘a dark metaphor for the order and entropy of language’ [1]; an absurd pairing of voice and text. The incoherent narrative descends into rhythmic visual and aural abstraction, demonstrating the futility of attempts to verbalise the very qualities of the image/text relationship which inherently remain a dark matter of sorts. The voice, in its attempt to articulate some elusive meaning, falls victim to its own twists of the tongue. The appropriated film titles in Torsten Lauschmann’s Skipping over damaged areas, 2010, are strung together to form a new narrative, unified by an archetypal male voiceover. As with Rose’s Secondary Currents, the viewer is aware of an element of incongruence between what appears on screen and what the voice is narrating; in this case it is an awareness of the disparity between the source material—titles sourced from an array of Hollywood films and the artist’s transformation of these texts as fragments within a cinematic collage. This reconfiguration of the original sources opens up the text to new readings and repurposes main titles into constituent parts within a new imagined, cinematic narrative. The viewer is caught between recognising the titles {{in the context of the}} source material and reading them in the context of the spoken narrative. Allan Hughes similarly uses the voice as an overarching structure in his work, Point of Audition, 2009. Originally a two channel, synchronised video installation, it is included here as a single channel preview. The video shows a <b>tape</b> <b>spool</b> revolving in time with an actor lip-syncing to a recording of Fonda’s Vietnam radio broadcasts in a room recalling the style of the therapy scenes in Alan J Pakula's 1971 film Klute. The actor playing Fonda in the restaged scene is wearing a military style jacket; a black and white picture of Fonda in Vietnam can be seen on the wall; a shelf of books in the background includes Michel Chion’s Film: A Sound Art, 2009, and Philip Rosen's Narrative, Apparatus, Ideology: A Film Reader, 1986. The work places the politically charged recordings within an aesthetic construct that offers intertextual reference points, renegotiating the role of the (disembodied) voice in both the audio recording and the film through re-enactment. As described in Temple Bar Gallery and Studios’ press release for the group exhibition Lights, Camera, Action!, ‘the work examines the function and effect of remediation on the voice and explores the consequences of establishing the voice as an object that is extra-linguistic to speech. The material aspect of the voice shifts between historical subjects, the work and the spectator. ’ [2] In each of these works, the artists shift textual elements into new contexts, forcing the viewer to recognise a schism between text as a sensual, aesthetic object and text as a linguistic construct. Spoken and written texts are employed as fluid, changeable material, with any sense of fixed (narrative) meaning upheaved through a reconfiguration of the relationship between voice, text and screen. In some cases, the meaning of the text simply shifts and is reframed; in the most liberating cases, it just stops making any sense at all. Suzanne van der Linge...|$|E

50|$|Following the {{invention}} of the audion tube in 1906, electric microphones gradually replaced the purely acoustical recording methods of earlier dictaphones by the late 1930s. In 1945, the SoundScriber and Gray Audograph, which cut grooves into a plastic disc, was introduced, and two years later Dictaphone replaced wax cylinders with their Dictabelt technology, which cut a mechanical groove into a plastic belt instead of into a wax cylinder. This was later replaced by magnetic tape recording. While reel-to-reel tape was used for dictation, the inconvenience of threading <b>tape</b> <b>spools</b> led to development of more convenient formats, notably the Compact Cassette, Mini-Cassette, and Microcassette.|$|R

50|$|Early {{computer}} resident {{monitors and}} operating systems were relatively primitive {{and were not}} capable of sophisticated resource allocation.

A typical example of this kind of language, still in use on mainframes, is IBM's Job Control Language (also known as JCL).

50|$|Garriott {{began writing}} {{computer}} games in 1974. His first games were created on and for teletype terminals. The code was stored on paper <b>tape</b> <b>spools</b> {{and the game}} was displayed as an ongoing print-out on the spools of printer paper produced by teletype machines. In summer 1979, Garriott worked at a ComputerLand store where he had his first encounter with Apple computers. Inspired by their video monitors with color graphics, he began to add perspective view to his own games. After he created Akalabeth for fun, {{the owner of the}} store convinced Garriott it might sell. Garriott spent US$200 printing copies of a manual and cover sheet that his mother had drawn, then he put copies of the game in Ziploc bags to sell at the store. Although Garriott sold fewer than a dozen copies of Akalabeth at the store, one copy made it to California Pacific, who signed a deal with him. The game sold over 30,000 copies, and Garriott received $5 for each copy sold. Akalabeth is considered the first published Computer Role Playing Game. In the fall, Garriott entered the University of Texas at Austin, joined the school's fencing team and later joined the Society for Creative Anachronism. He created Ultima I while at the university. It was published by California Pacific Computers and sold in Ziploc plastic bags, as was common in those days.|$|R

25|$|Some {{cassettes}} {{were made}} to play a continuous loop of tape without stopping. Lengths available are from around 30 seconds to a standard full length. They are used in situations where a short message or musical jingle is to be played, either continuously or whenever a device is triggered, or whenever continuous recording or playing is needed. Some include a sensing foil on the tape to allow tape players to re-cue. From as early as 1969 various patents have been issued, covering such uses as uni-directional, bi-directional, and compatibility with auto-shut-off and anti-tape-eating mechanisms. One variant has a half-width loop of tape for an answering machine outgoing message, and another half-width <b>tape</b> on <b>spools</b> to record incoming messages.|$|R

50|$|The Microcassette (often written generically as microcassette) is {{an audio}} storage medium, {{introduced}} by Olympus in 1969. It {{uses the same}} width of magnetic tape as the Compact Cassette but in a much smaller container. By using thinner tape and half or a quarter the tape speed, microcassettes can offer comparable recording time to the compact cassette. The original standard microcassette, the MC60, gives 30 minutes recording per side at its standard speed of 2.4 cm/s, and double that duration at 1.2 cm/s; an MC90, giving 45 minutes per side @ 2.4 cm/s, is also available from a few manufacturers. Unlike the Compact Cassette, a choice of recording speeds was provided on the original recorders and many others; the <b>tape</b> also <b>spools</b> in the opposite direction, from right to left. For transcription purposes, continuously variable speed was provided on many players.|$|R
5000|$|Individual {{rolls of}} 135 film are {{enclosed}} in single-spool, light-tight, metal cassettes to allow cameras to be loaded in daylight.

50|$|By {{this time}} the World Record Club was also {{releasing}} pre-recorded <b>spool</b> <b>tapes</b> of their LPs. These were mainly produced in mono half-track at 3¾ ips. The quality of the tapes was very high and the price reasonable. They appealed to enthusiasts who had tape recorders for making their own recordings, because at that time broadcast sound quality (for off-air recordings) was not very high. These tapes were released with the prefix TT. Although in mono, they are half-track, which gives a very high and gratifying signal to noise ratio. A number of 7½ ips half track stereo tapes were also released under the WRC label, in plain white boxes with a historical sculpture in orange on the front. At least 8 were produced, {{one of which is}} of Scheherezade with Eugene Goossens.|$|R
5000|$|Last-position memory {{dates back}} to the days of {{magnetic}} tape-based media. For instance, open-reel tapes and cassette tapes automatically have this property since they automatically stay where they are when paused or stopped. Indeed, tape-based media can be started and stopped and left at any point, and moved to any point, the only problem being that the further the point one wishes to move to in a recording, the longer it takes to get there. It is easy to go back and listen again to the last few seconds of a tape recording, e.g. to listen to something one could not hear properly. Some tapes such as 8-track tapes couldn't be re-wound, seeing as [...] "looped" [...] with a solenoid that shifted the <b>tape</b> to a <b>spool</b> aside of its endless loop.|$|R
5000|$|The CVC format used a {{cassette}} {{slightly larger than}} an audio cassette (approximately 105x66x13mm) and was loaded with 6.5mm magnetic tape. Unlike most other video cassette formats that have two spools of fixed diameter, being so small in size CVC's were designed to operate {{in a manner similar}} to a standard audio cassette: as the magnetic <b>tape</b> vacated one <b>spool</b> it would pass over the head of the player and be fed to the second spool of the cassette filling it out. Initially only V30 tapes were available which ran for 30 minutes, then later V45 (45 minute) and V60 (60 minute) models were introduced. The format was released for NTSC, PAL and SECAM television systems (with cassettes labelled [...] "VExx") and, like most analogue systems, tapes had to be played on machines using the same TV system as the recording.|$|R
5000|$|... nicely began {{recording}} the follow-up, [...] "Hilly Fields (1892)", in December 1980, but the recording process {{was slow and}} laborious, and nicely had to sell his personal possessions {{to pay for the}} studio time. Recording of the song took six months to complete, followed by another month of production work before nicely was happy with the results. Hearing the early demo of the song, Hansa turned down the opportunity to release it, but an A&R man at EMI was more enthusiastic and signed nicely to the label. [...] "Hilly Fields" [...] was recorded at Heath Levy's own small studio and at Alvic Studios in west London, and again featured Jeff Leach on keyboards, along with Ian Pearce on drums, Rickman Godlee on cello, and [...] "Kate" [...] on additional vocals—for many years the rumour was that [...] "Kate" [...] was actually Kate Bush, but in 2010 nicely explained that [...] "I was always tied to Kate Bush with this rumor that she was on 'Hilly Fields'... Kate Jackson did vocals on 'D.C.T. Dreams'—I didn't know that was her surname, I wasn't sure. So on 'Hilly Fields' I used the same bit of tape of her singing and I just put 'Kate' because I didn't know her name. She's in the credits. And the rumor just got out of hand and I've always denied it but it still carries on a little bit because Bush did live around the corner and she was on EMI." [...] The track features an obvious 1960s psychedelic influence, cello playing, the 1980s synth-pop sound, and what {{is believed to be the}} first ever example of scratching on a non-hip hop recording, although the [...] "scratching" [...] was actually created by moving two <b>tape</b> <b>spools</b> back and forth, rather than on a turntable. The song was named after Hilly Fields park in Brockley, south-east London, close to where nicely lived. [...] "Hilly Fields" [...] was released in January 1982, and is regarded by many as nicely's masterpiece. On its release it was made Single of the Week in the NME and described as [...] "the best psychedelic record made since the '60s". In spite of, or due to, its obscurity it is considered in some circles to be [...] "legendary". The B-side was originally going to be a song called [...] "6B Obergine", but three days before the single was due to be cut it was replaced by the typically 1960s-psych-inspired [...] "49 Cigars", which was recorded and mixed in just two days. Despite favourable reviews in the music press, the single was not well promoted by EMI (nicely believed that this was due in part to bad feeling between the label and his manager at the time), and as a result the song had almost no distribution or airplay, and failed to make an impression on the charts.|$|R
40|$|For over 10 years, laser plasma {{acceleration}} (LPA) {{has been}} a rapidly growing technologyused to create electron beams on length-scales much smaller {{than that of a}} conventionalRF-accelerator [1]. As electron beam properties improve, research for LPAs is expanding totake advantage of the creation and accessibility of high-quality electron beams from plasmatargets. Two applications which are currently being explored are a multi-stage plasmaaccelerator to reach energies greater than those a single-stage accelerator can achieve andexploring the possibility of an LPA based free-electron laser (FEL) light source. Researchsupporting both of these efforts has been performed on the 50 TW TREX laser system atthe BELLA Center at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and the results of these effortsare described in this dissertation. Using chirped-pulsed amplification to produce high-quality laser pulses up to petawattlevels, experimental results have yielded laser driven electron beam energies up to 4. 25 GeV [2]. By tuning the density of the target, the accelerating gradients sustained by theplasma can grow beyond 100 GeV/m [3] (10 ^ 3 times larger than that of a conventional RFaccelerator). However, limiting factors such as dephasing of the electron beam from theplasma wake, defocusing of a laser pulse, and energy depletion of the laser into the plasmalimit the maximum sensible length of a plasma accelerator. Staging the LPA with two ormore accelerating modules could be the next step towards producing beams with energiesgreater than those possible with a single stage. One requirement for staged acceleration is that the laser pulse used to drive the firstaccelerating stage must be coupled out of the beamline, and a fresh laser pulse must becoupled in for the second stage to post accelerate the electrons. To do this while maintaininga short scale length between the two stages requires an optic to be placed near the final focus of the second laser pulse. Because damage will occur when the laser pulse interacts with a steering optic near focus, the coupling optic must be capable of replacing the surfacefollowing damage on each successive shot. This thesis comprises a detailed investigation of the physics of using a plasma mirror (PM) from a tape by reflecting ultrashort pulses froma laser-triggered surface plasma. The tapes used in the characterization of the PM are VHSand computer data storage tape. The tapes are 6. 6 m (computer storage tape) and 15 m(VHS) thick. Each tape is 0. 5 inches wide, and 10 s of meters of <b>tape</b> are <b>spooled</b> using a <b>tape</b> drive; providing thousands of shots on a single reel of tape. The amount of reflected energy of the PM was studied for different input intensities. The fluence was varied by translating the focus of the laser upstream and downstream of the tape, which changed the spot size on the tape surface and hence changed the fluence. This study measured reflectances {{from both sides of the}} two tapes, and for input light of both s and p-polarizations. Lastly, an analytic model was developed to understand the reflectance as a function of fluence for each tape material and polarization. Another application that benefits from the advancements of LPA technology is an LPAbasedFEL. By sending a high quality electron bunch through an undulator (a periodicstructure of positive and negative magnetic poles), the electrons oscillate transversely to thepropagation axis and produce radiation. The 1. 5 m THUNDER undulator [4] at the BELLACenter has been commissioned using electron beams of 400 MeV beams with broad energyspread (35 %) [5]. To produce a coherent LPA-based FEL, the beam quality would need toimprove to sub-percent level energy spread. A seed source could be used to help inducebunching of the electron beam within the undulator. This thesis described the experimental investigation of the physics of using solid-basedsurface high-harmonic generation (SHHG) from a thin tape as a possible seed source foran FEL. A thin tape placed within centimeters of the undulator's entrance could act asa harmonic generating source, while simultaneously transmitting an electron beam. Thisremoves the need for transport optics for the XUV photons and the need for additionaloptics to overlap the seed beam with the electron beam at the undulator entrance. By operating at sub-relativistic laser strengths, harmonics up to the 17 th order of 800 nm light are produced using an SHHG technique known as coherent wake emission (CWE). CWE pulse properties such as divergence, energy, conversion efficiency, and spectrum aremeasured for a wide range of tape materials and drive laser conditions. A clear correlationbetween surface roughness and harmonic beam divergence is found. The measured pulseproperties for the 15 th harmonic from VHS tape (conversion efficiency 6. 5 x 10 ^- 7 andan rms divergence of 12 mrad), the 100 mJ-level, 40 - 50 fs-class drive laser, produces peakpowers of several MW's of XUV pulses. The results of a 1 D model indicate that these CWEpulses with MW level powers are sufficient for seed-induced FEL gain...|$|R
