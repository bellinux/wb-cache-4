40|$|An {{efficient}} automated {{minimum weight}} design procedure is presented which is applicable to sizing structural systems {{that can be}} idealized by truss, shear panel, and constant strain triangles. Static stress and displacement constraints under alternative loading conditions are considered. The optimization algorithm is an adaptation of the method of inscribed hyperspheres and high efficiency is achieved by using several approximation concepts including <b>temporary</b> <b>deletion</b> of noncritical constraints, design variable linking, and Taylor series expansions for response variables in terms of design variables. Optimum designs for several planar and space truss example problems are presented. The results reported support the contention that the innovative use of approximation concepts in structural synthesis can produce significant improvements in efficiency...|$|E

Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC 2 s) produce cytokines such as IL- 5 and IL- 13, {{are required for}} immune defense against helminth infections, and {{are involved in the}} pathogenesis of airway hyperreactivity. Here, we have investigated the role of the transcription factor GATA- 3 for ILC 2 differentiation and maintenance. We showed that ILC 2 s and their lineage-specified bone marrow precursors (ILC 2 Ps), as identified here, were characterized by continuous high expression of GATA- 3. Analysis of mice with <b>temporary</b> <b>deletion</b> of GATA- 3 in all ILCs showed that GATA- 3 was required for the differentiation and maintenance of ILC 2 s but not for RORÎ³t+ ILCs. Thus, our data demonstrate that GATA- 3 is essential for ILC 2 fate decisions and reveal similarities between the transcriptional programs controlling ILC and T helper cell fates...|$|E

40|$|Multilevel {{optimization}} {{methods are}} {{being considered for}} the design of complex systems on distributed networks of computers or even parallel processors. An obstacle to the use of multilevel methods is that they can be computationally expensive because of the cycling necessary to account for the coupling between the subproblems. This research effort aims at increasing the efficiency of multilevel optimization by adapting two techniques that are widely used in conventional one-level optimization: constraint approximation and <b>temporary</b> constraint <b>deletion.</b> These improvements are implemented and tested on three-, ten- and 52 -bar planar truss designs. The results show that for larger problems (approximately 100 design variables and larger), the cost of analysis dominates the total cost so that multilevel optimization is no more expensive than one-level optimization. If parallel processing is used or the analysis process itself is decomposed, then multilevel optimization stands to become more economical than one-level optimization...|$|R
40|$|A {{structural}} synthesis {{methodology for}} the minimum mass design of 3 -dimensionall frame-truss structures under multiple static loading conditions {{and subject to}} limits on displacements, rotations, stresses, local buckling, and element cross-sectional dimensions is presented. A variety of approximation concept options are employed to yield near optimum designs after no more than 10 structural analyses. Available options include: (A) formulation of the nonlinear mathematcal programming problem in either reciprocal section property (RSP) or cross-sectional dimension (CSD) space; (B) two alternative approximate problem structures in each design space; and (C) three distinct assumptions about element end-force variations. Fixed element, design element linking, and <b>temporary</b> constraint <b>deletion</b> features are also included. The solution of each approximate problem, in either its primal or dual form, is obtained using CONMIN, a feasible directions program. The frame-truss synthesis methodology is implemented in the COMPASS computer program and is used to solve a variety of problems. These problems were chosen so that, in addition to exercising the various approximation concepts options, the results could be compared with previously published work...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to integrate the design space for structural/control system optimization problems {{in the case of}} linear state feedback control. Nonstructural lumped masses and control system design variables as well as structural sizing variables are all treated equally as independent design variables in the optimization process. Structural and control design variable linking schemes are used in order to avoid a prohibitively large increase in the total number of independent design variables. When actuator masses are treated as nonstructural lumped mass design variables, special consideration is given to the relation between the transient peak responses and the required actuator masses which is formulated as a behavior constraint form. The original nonlinear mathematical programming problem based on a finite element formulation and linear state feedback is replaced by a sequence of explicit approximate problems exploiting various approximation concepts such as design variable linkings, <b>temporary</b> constraint <b>deletion</b> and first order Taylor series expansion of nonlinear behavior constraints in terms of intermediate design variables. Examples which involve a variety of dynamic behavior constraints (including constraints on closed-loop eigenvalues, peak transient displacements, peak actuator forces, and relations between the peak responses and the actuator masses) are effectively solved by using the method presented...|$|R
