5|$|In January 1934, a new radio, {{telegraph}} and <b>telephone</b> <b>link</b> {{was installed}} at Lympne and St Inglevert which came into operation on 26 January. Sir Philip Sassoon officially declared the installation open. The equipment at Lympne was manufactured by Standard Telephones and Cables and operated on the 17-cm wave band. From 13 to 27 July, 606 (City of Glasgow) Squadron AuxAF held its annual camp at Lympne, followed by 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF from 29 July to 12 August. On {{the weekend of}} 1–2 September competitions for the Folkestone Aero Trophy and the Wakefield Cup were held. Both competitions were won by pilots flying the de Havilland DH.60 Moth G-AAMU. Later that month a second batch of ten Avro 626s of the Egyptian Army Air Force departed from Lympne for Egypt.|$|E
25|$|There are {{attacks on}} Free State troops at Cahir, Tipperary and Omeath, Louth. One officer, Captain Walshe is killed {{and three others}} wounded in an ambush in Tipperary. The <b>telephone</b> <b>link</b> between Dublin and Dundalk is cut.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1920s the NSW State Government {{improved}} {{both the}} road and rail links in the region. Wagga Wagga {{was part of a}} new <b>telephone</b> <b>link</b> between Melbourne and Sydney and a new Post and Telegraph office was constructed to house the repeating centre, {{one of the largest in}} regional Australia. Residential growth continued with a population in 1921 of 11,631.|$|E
50|$|The National Broadcasting Company began regular {{broadcasting}} in 1926, with <b>telephone</b> <b>links</b> between New York {{and other}} Eastern cities. NBC became the dominant radio network, splitting into Red and Blue networks.|$|R
50|$|Finally {{instead of}} being able to call only one {{telephone}} {{on the other end of}} your private line, the businesses and government offices could connect via the switchboard to any of the 25 <b>telephones</b> <b>linked</b> at the start of the switchboard service.|$|R
50|$|Usenet was {{originally}} designed {{based on the}} UUCP network, with most article transfers taking place over direct point-to-point <b>telephone</b> <b>links</b> between news servers, which were powerful time-sharing systems. Readers and posters logged into these computers reading the articles directly from the local disk.|$|R
25|$|The Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Environment Secretary Hilary Benn {{returned}} to London early from their holidays, {{in a story}} broken by BBC News journalist Gary O'Donoghue that in turn led to accusations of discrimination against the BBC. Welsh Minister for Rural Affairs Elin Jones cut short her holiday to New Zealand, and opposition leader David Cameron also cancelled his holiday in Brittany. A COBRA meeting took place shortly before the official announcement, with the Prime Minister participating on a <b>telephone</b> <b>link.</b>|$|E
25|$|Having {{seen the}} disaster, Henry Charles ran to Rocky Point, {{where there was}} a <b>telephone</b> <b>link</b> to the {{quarantine}} station at William Head. The quarantine station received the call at 7:56 p.m. They blew the emergency whistle, and five minutes later Captain Thomas Riley took out the government steamer Madge to go to the scene (Madge as the quarantine vessel always had steam up, because they never knew when a ship might arrive.) When they got there, they cruised around in the dark for about two hours looking for bodies or wreckage, but found none.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate on}} the new oil law {{occurred}} in 1925, with U.S. interests opposing all initiatives. By 1926, the new law was enacted. In January 1927 the Mexican government canceled the permits of oil companies that would not comply with the law. Talks of war circulated by the U.S. president and in the editorial pages of the New York Times. Mexico managed to avoid war {{through a series of}} diplomatic maneuvers. Soon after, a direct <b>telephone</b> <b>link</b> was established between Calles and President Calvin Coolidge, and the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, James R. Sheffield, was replaced with Dwight Morrow. Morrow won the Calles government over to the United States position and helped negotiate an agreement {{between the government and the}} oil companies.|$|E

2500|$|Italian radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi used a {{parabolic}} reflector during the 1930s in investigations of UHF transmission from his {{boat in the}} Mediterranean. [...] In 1931 a [...] 1.7GHz microwave relay <b>telephone</b> <b>link</b> across the English Channel using 10ft. (3 meter) diameter dishes was demonstrated. [...] The first large parabolic antenna, a 9 m dish, was built in 1937 by pioneering radio astronomer Grote Reber in his backyard, and the sky survey he did with {{it was one of}} the events that founded the field of radio astronomy.|$|E
2500|$|The network {{put up a}} green ABC Sports graphic {{while it}} {{scrambled}} to repair the video feed (the broadcast cameras and mics were powered by the local power supply), but audio from the stadium was restored {{after a few seconds}} via a <b>telephone</b> <b>link.</b> Michaels had to pick up a POTS phone in the press booth (phones work off a separate power supply) and call ABC headquarters in New York, at which point they put him back on the air. Michaels cracked, [...] "Well, folks, that's the greatest open in the history of television, bar none!" [...] accompanied by the combined screams of excitement and panic from fans who had no idea of the devastation elsewhere. ABC then switched to an episode of Roseanne which was on standby for a rain delay situation, while attempting to restore electricity to its remote equipment.|$|E
50|$|Department of {{high-frequency}} devices {{was constantly}} guard by a German soldier {{with the two}} duty mechanics. The Nazis were very interested in this department because there were special German devices to maintain <b>telephone</b> <b>links</b> with Vienna, Berlin, Belgrade and Athens, and through them went cables from Berlin to Odessa and Sofia.|$|R
5000|$|Telephone system: modern local, interisland, and {{international}} (wire/radio integrated) public and special-purpose telephone, telegraph, and teleprinter facilities; regional radio communications center; telephone or radio <b>telephone</b> <b>links</b> to almost all inhabited islands; most towns and large villages have automatic telephone exchanges and direct dialing; combined fixed and mobile-cellular teledensity roughly 100 per 100 persons (2011).|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} never used for {{overseas}} <b>telephone</b> <b>links,</b> which (before {{the advent of}} undersea cables and satellites) were provided by two New Zealand Post Office radio stations, Makara Radio (receiving) west of Wellington and Himatangi Radio Station (transmitting) near Himatangi Beach. Only {{a limited number of}} voice circuits were available, and overseas toll calls were expensive.|$|R
2500|$|Wanting to {{be closer}} to the battle, French moved to a forward command post at Lilliers, less than 20 miles behind First Army's front. [...] He left Robertson and most of his staff behind at GHQ and had no direct <b>telephone</b> <b>link</b> to First Army. [...] Haig's {{infantry}} attacked at 6.30am on 25 September and he sent an officer by car requesting release of the reserves at 7am—he did not hear until 10.02am that the divisions were moving up to the front. [...] French visited Haig between 11–11.30 and agreed that Haig could have the reserve, but rather than using the telephone he drove to Haking's Headquarters and gave the order personally at 12.10pm. [...] Haig then heard from Haking at 1.20pm that the reserves were moving forward, {{but by the time the}} men, already exhausted from an overnight march in the rain, reached the front line through the chaos of the battlefield they were committed against strengthened German positions the following morning.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are some}} 20 {{buildings}} on Canna and Sanday, including three churches, {{one of which}} has been deconsecrated (see below). There is also a post office which was converted from a garden shed. The Canna tea room, which closed in 2008, reopened in 2010 as the Gille Brighde Cafe and Restaurant. This restaurant closed in 2013 but has since re-opened again as Cafe Canna. [...] A new resident manager for the island was appointed in 2010. The island is isolated and in the past inhabitants have had to buy all their provisions from the mainland, but it now has a small unstaffed shop operated on an 'honesty' basis. There is a <b>telephone</b> <b>link,</b> a red telephone box and broadband internet access, although there is no mobile phone coverage. Electricity is provided by a diesel generator, at mainland voltage and frequency, and there is a private water supply. [...] In 2010 a proposal to establish a fish farm off Canna was defeated in a residents' ballot, even though it would have created a number of new jobs.|$|E
2500|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, Game 3 of the 1989 World Series (initially {{scheduled for}} October 17) was delayed by ten days {{due to the}} Loma Prieta earthquake. The earthquake struck at approximately 5:04p.m. Pacific Time. At the moment the quake struck, ABC's color commentator Tim McCarver was narrating taped highlights of the previous Series game. Viewers saw the video signal begin to break up, heard McCarver repeat a sentence as the shaking distracted him, and heard McCarver's colleague Al Michaels exclaim, [...] "I'll tell you what, we're having an earth—." [...] At that moment, the feed from Candlestick Park was lost. The network put up a green ABC Sports graphic as the audio was switched to a <b>telephone</b> <b>link.</b> Michaels had to pickup a POTS phone in the press booth (phones work off a separate power supply) and call ABC headquarters in New York, at which point they put him back on the air.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of wireless <b>telephone</b> <b>links</b> {{are quite different}} from those of wireline links. In particular, standard TCP/IP performs poorly in an environment where these links are combined. We have designed and implemented a communication architecture for the efficient operation over an internetwork consisting of fixed networks and wireless telephone networks. In our architecture the Mobile-Connection Host is the bridge between the wired and wireless networks. It allows us to transparently replace TCP/IP over the wireless medium with a special transport service called the Mowgli Data Channel Service (MDCS). The MDCS is designed to take into account long latencies, narrow bandwidth, highly variable transmission delays, and sudden disconnections. As a result, the MDCS significantly improves the fault tolerance and performance of communication over wireless <b>telephone</b> <b>links.</b> In this paper we describe the MDCS and its implementation as the Mowgli Data Channel Protocol (MDCP).
