3000|$|As {{evident from}} Figures 5 and 6, the [...] "downstairs" [...] curves with {{inserted}} SP-frames corresponding to different QP, calculated using Equation 1, {{do not have}} coinciding <b>transition</b> <b>points,</b> also the <b>transition</b> <b>points</b> of the [...] "downstairs" [...] with SP-frames do not coincide with the SP-frames inserted, because of the drift of <b>transition</b> <b>points</b> from its original positions. The implication of this observation {{is that all the}} inserted SP-frames are not suitable for switching as condition of zero buffer content and high bandwidth utilization at the time of switching cannot be satisfied. To make most of the SP-frames suitable for switching, it is necessary that [...] "downstairs" [...] corresponding to different QPs after inserting SP-frames must have coinciding <b>transition</b> <b>points</b> and also those <b>transition</b> <b>points</b> must have SP-frames, i.e., the [...] "downstairs" [...] with inserted SP-frames should maintain the monotonicity of original [...] "downstairs" [...] (without inserting SP-frames) and most of the <b>transition</b> <b>points</b> should be unaltered.

He topped the Australian first-class batting averages with 71.10, but had his poorest {{season with the}} ball, taking only 16wickets at 38.75. The season was purely domestic with no touring side and therefore no Test matches. The season was also a <b>transition</b> <b>point</b> in Australian cricket, as Hassett retired upon return to Australia. Initially, Morris and Miller were the two frontrunners for the captaincy. Miller was the state captain, but Morris was the vice-captain of the Test team ahead of Miller. At the time, Johnson had been dropped from the Australian team, but inherited the Victorian captaincy from Hassett, who accused him of not trying. Hassett told Johnson that he could become Test captain if he regained his form and his Test position. As the outgoing captain, Hassett was believed to have an influence over the selection of his successor. Miller had also criticised Hassett in his book, and there was talk that Hassett was upset about Miller's departure from South Melbourne and Victoria. Johnson {{returned to}} form with 45wickets at 22.75 for the season.|$|E

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of inhibitors (drugs, antibiotics, and antimetabolites) will block cell {{division}} within an ongoing cell cycle in autotrophic cultures of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. To determine when during the cell cycle a given inhibitor is effective in preventing cell division, a technique is described which does not rely {{on the use of}} synchronous cultures. The technique permits the measurement of <b>transition</b> <b>points,</b> the cell cycle stage at which the subsequent cell division becomes insensitive to the effects of an inhibitor. A map of <b>transition</b> <b>points</b> in the cell cycle reveals that they are grouped into two broad periods, the second and fourth quarters.

[...] This cove's waters are shallower than any other in the park, and its beaches are sandy, unlike some of the coves farther out.

An basic preprocessing step before building a motion graph is to compute pose similarities between all pairs of frames in motion data and find out local minima as candidate <b>transition</b> <b>points.</b> However, this task can be very time consuming. In this paper, we introduce a simple strategy to compute local minima efficiently. Instead of fully computing all pairs of frames in motion data to compose the resulting motion distance map, our method uniformly sample the distance map by skip frames according to an user defined sampling interval. The local minima in sampled distance map are thus restricted on sampling grids, and we introduce error metrics to evaluate the loss in accuracy. We use this error metrics as guidance to adjusting the positions of candidate <b>transition</b> <b>points.</b> We also provide an simple method to deter-mine appropriate sampling interval.
