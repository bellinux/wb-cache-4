It is essential for registered dietitians to be effective adult educators as they teach adults in various employment settings. Review of the literature revealed that one important factor in being an effective adult educator is developing a <b>teaching</b> <b>style</b> which facilitates learning, known as learner-centered <b>teaching</b> <b>style.</b> The purpose of this descriptive {{study was to identify}} the <b>teaching</b> <b>style</b> preference and identify factors that have influenced registered dietitians' <b>teaching</b> <b>style</b> preference. The study sample of six hundred registered dietitians residing in the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin) were sent two tools to complete, the "Principles of Adult Learning Scale (PALS) ". Two hundred and fifty-two respondents completed the questionnaire and PALS, designed by Conti to determine <b>teaching</b> <b>style</b> preference. The overall PALS scores were computer generated. Frequency distributions and populations percentages were calculated for demographic and descriptive data. The mean, median, and standard deviation of PALS scores were calculated. Analysis of various factors and the PALS scores. The findings suggest that registered dietitians' <b>teaching</b> <b>style</b> preference is teacher-centered. The years of employment positively affected <b>teaching</b> <b>style</b> toward learnercentered until the dietitian had been employed more than 16 years, then the years of employment negatively affected <b>teaching</b> <b>style</b> preference. The number of formal educational sessions relating to adult education had the most positive effect on <b>teaching</b> <b>style</b> preference. The number of continuing education session related to adult education proved to be the factor that most affected <b>teaching</b> <b>style</b> preferences. The study has implications for registered dietitians regarding dietetic education and curriculum development, continuing professional education and adult educators utilizing the PALS instrument.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we {{examined}} how the variables: teaching autonomy, <b>teaching</b> goals <b>teaching</b> <b>style</b> and teachers' perceptions of transactional distance (TTD) work together within the pedagogical decision-making process in different teaching environments. The independent variable was the teaching environment, which was divided into three: entirely distance environment (Distance-E); blended distance environment (Distance-B); and the traditional environment (Traditional). The dependent variables were teaching autonomy, <b>teaching</b> goals, <b>teaching</b> <b>style</b> and TTD, i. e. teachers' evaluation {{of their ability to}} communicate with the students, explain the content and their satisfaction from the teaching environment. One hundred and sixty faculty members who teach in distance environments and one hundred and sixty faculty members who teach in a traditional environment answered a five-part study questionnaire. The finding indicated that teaching autonomy, teaching goal and <b>teaching</b> <b>style</b> are significant predictors of TTD. Furthermore, <b>teaching</b> <b>style</b> serves as a mediator variable connecting teaching autonomy and the teaching goal to the TTD. This pattern was repeated in both structural and measurement models in all three teaching environments, indicating the centrality of the <b>teaching</b> <b>style</b> as well as teaching goal and teaching autonomy in the teachers' pedagogical decision-making process and teaching outputs. We concluded that affecting the teachers' pedagogical characteristics, which serve as mechanisms that influence the results of teaching, is an important component in the process of the technological change in 21 st century education...|$|R
