It was standardized as a bombardment group and redesignated the 509th Bombardment Group, Very Heavy, on 10 July 1946.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>era,</b> Poland, Spain, and Germany {{developed}} or re-established many well-respected Arabian stud farms. The studs of Poland {{in particular}} were decimated {{by both the}} Nazis and the Soviets, but were able to reclaim some of their breeding stock and became particularly world-renowned for their quality Arabian horses, tested rigorously by racing and other performance standards. During the 1950s, the Russians also obtained additional horses from Egypt to augment their breeding programs.|$|E
5|$|Almost every fighter {{project in}} <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>era</b> {{immediately}} applied the concept, which started appearing on production fighters {{in the late}} 1940s. Avro engineers explored swept-wing and tail modifications to the CF-100 known as the CF-103, which had proceeded to wooden mock-up stage. The CF-103 offered improved transonic performance with supersonic abilities in a dive. However, the basic CF-100 continued to improve through this period, and the advantages were continually eroded. When a CF-100 broke the sound barrier on 18 December 1952, interest in the CF-103 waned.|$|E

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>era,</b> Indiana {{became a}} {{critical}} swing state that often helped decide which party controlled the presidency. Elections were very close, {{and became the}} center of frenzied attention with many parades, speeches and rallies as election day approached; voter turnout ranging over 90% to near 100% in such elections as 1888 and 1896. In remote areas, both sides paid their supporters to vote, and occasionally paid supporters of the opposition not to vote. Despite allegations, historians have found very little fraud in national elections.|$|E
5|$|With new {{suburban}} developments beckoning, {{many white}} middle-class residents {{moved out of}} the city along new highway routes, and Norfolk's population declined, a pattern repeated in numerous cities during <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>era</b> independently of segregation issues. In the late-1960s and early-1970s, the advent of newer suburban shopping destinations along with freeways spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown's Granby Street commercial corridor, located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront. The opening of malls and large shopping centers drew off retail business from Granby Street.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>era,</b> the Haflinger was indiscriminately crossed {{with other}} breeds and some {{observers}} feared the breed was in renewed danger of extinction. However, starting in 1946, breeders focused on producing purebred Haflingers and a closed stud book was created. Interest in the breed increased {{in other countries}} and between 1950 and 1974 the population grew, even while the overall European horse population decreased. Population numbers continued to increase steadily and as of 2005, almost 250,000Haflingers existed worldwide. There are breeding farms in several countries, {{although most of the}} breeding stock still comes from Austria. In 2003, a Haflinger became the first horse to be cloned, resulting in a filly named Prometea.|$|E

5|$|Hatfield was {{a popular}} Governor who {{supported}} Oregon's traditional industries of timber and agriculture, but felt that in <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>era</b> expansion of industry and funding for transportation and education needed to be priorities. While governor he worked to begin the diversification of the state's economy, such as recruiting industrial development and holding trade missions. As part of the initiative, he helped to found the Oregon Graduate Center {{in what is now}} the Silicon Forest in Washington County in 1963. A graduate level school in the Portland area (Portland State was still a college with no graduate programs at this time) was seen by business leaders as essential to attracting new industries and by Tektronix as needed to retain highly skilled workers. In lieu of the standard portrait for former governors, Hatfield is represented by a marble bust at the Oregon State Capitol.|$|E
5|$|Since the Turtle’s {{emergence}} {{over two}} centuries ago, the international playing field has leveled. The monopoly over submersible technology once {{held by the}} United States was lost over time as other navies around the world modernized and adopted submarine warfare. From the innovations of John Holland {{in the early twentieth}} century to the German U-boat campaigns of the World Wars, and the nuclear-powered ICBM submarines of the Cold War, modern navies embraced the submarine, first, for missions of reconnaissance and commerce-raiding, but, increasingly, in offensive, attack roles. In <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>era,</b> the submarine has become a central component of modern navies. Submarine usage has gone far beyond Bushnell’s conception of lifting naval blockades designed to bleed a country dry of their imports to become an essential arm of offensive naval warfare and power projection.|$|E

25|$|Modern enka, as {{developed}} in <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>era,</b> {{is a form}} of sentimental ballad music.

The most famous male enka singer is Kiyoshi Hikawa.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} century, {{veterans}} of America's wars have shown extraordinary human longevity in <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>eras.</b> As a result, contemporary public historical {{interpretations of the}} American second world war experience {{have been influenced by}} veterans' perceptions of historical issues for a longer time than was true of <b>postwar</b> <b>eras</b> before <b>the</b> twentieth centuıy. Public historical debates in the United States have recently focused on the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (1941) and the American attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945). These events may seem quite dated by now, but they have remarkable contemporary resonance in light of debates over proliferation of nuclear weapons and tactics of so-called pre-emptive warfare. Though the aerial attacks are often related in popular American perception, the truth is they were incommensurate events in terms of their military and political objectives, their physical scale and results, and the natures of their targets...|$|R
