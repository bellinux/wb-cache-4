The pension scheme for lecturers was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> of the new Teachers pension fund formed by the Teachers' (Superannuation) Act 1918. As pension funds affect staff at levels of their career this created pressure the Association to be one which included professors as well.|$|E

After their return to Germany in 1814, many if not most of the changes were kept in place.|$|E

25|$|It did {{not help}} that the Soviet Union had long refused to join FIDE, and by {{this time it was}} clear that about half the {{credible}} contenders were Soviet citizens. But the Soviet Union realized it could not afford <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> of the discussions about the vacant world championship, and in 1947 sent a telegram apologizing for the absence of Soviet representatives and requesting that the USSR be represented in future FIDE Committees.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time in 'Australian Idol' history there were 13 finalists. This came about during the Wildcard Verdict show on 5 September 2005. The judges {{initially}} chose James Kannis and Emily Williams to go through to the final. This left one spot which was chosen by the Australian public. Out of the remaining contestants the two that received the highest votes were Daniel Spillane and Roxane Lebrasse. With only 1% between them, Dan was announced as the final member of the Top 12. This meant Roxane had missed out yet again. The judges decided however that Roxane was too good <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> of the Top 12 so they made it a Top 13. The catch was that two contestants were eliminated {{in the first round of}} the finals.|$|E
25|$|Baebius spearheaded {{legislation}} {{to crack down}} on ambitus. Anyone convicted of bribery was disqualified from holding public office for ten years. This law was accompanied by an attempt to regulate prorogation. The Lex Baebia et Cornelia of 181 devised a complicated system aimed at limiting the number of ex-praetors vying for the consulship. In the sortition for provinciae, the two Spains were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> in odd-numbered years, and only four praetorships would be available in those years. In effect, a provincial appointment in Spain meant automatic prorogation, resulting in a two-year term. The Lex Baebia thus marks the constitutionalized acceptance of routinely extending commands past the year of the elected magistracy. This law was supported by M. Porcius Cato, the famous legislative and moral reformer. But because this limit only decreased the number of administrators available for other provinces, resulting in further use of prorogation, six praetors became the norm again in the mid-170s, and the moral issues were set aside.|$|E

25|$|When {{creating}} Bullet Witch, {{the team}} were {{pleased with the}} shift to high-definition graphics, but this and the game's identity as a new intellectual property meant they were taking financial risks. The move to next-generation hardware meant the team could include more destructible environments. They used 64-bit computing at a few points to speed up data exchange and improve visual effects. The game used the NoviceX physics engine. Working with the next-generation hardware was both exhilarating and difficult, as the team wanted to create something new rather than rely on existing code resources. The team wanted players {{to be able to}} navigate large areas with few or no loading screens, but these ambitions were originally muted by the console's limited power, and it was only during the later stages of development that they started resolving the issues. Due to the console's limitations, some potential effects and touches such as breaking glass, bullet marks in surfaces like building walls, and having Alicia's feet adjust to the slope of terrain had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> to increase processing power for the large-scale environments. While the team had wanted to achieve 60 frames per second, the team needed to reduce the framerate to 30 per second so all the effects would run smoothly.|$|E

[...] He takes a postmodern approach; Maus [...] "feeds on itself", telling the story of how the story was made. It examines the choices Spiegelman made in the retelling of his father's memories, and the artistic choices he had to make—for example, when his French wife converts to Judaism, Spiegelman's character frets over whether to depict her as a frog, a mouse, or another animal.|$|E

500|$|Beneath a Steel Sky was {{published}} in March 1994 by Virgin Interactive on floppy disks and CD-ROM. It came on 15 floppy disks, as opposed to Lure of The Temptress, which came on four. Because of the Amiga restrictions, a few animations had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>out,</b> as not all Amiga owners had a hard drive. Each conversion of the images to the Amiga resulted {{in a loss of}} detail because of the Amiga's limited palette and resolution. According to Revolution in-house artist Adam Tween, it took a couple of days to [...] "touch up" [...] the screens. A comic book created by Gibbons, which was translated into the introduction sequence of the game, came as part of the game package.|$|E
500|$|The Soviet Union was keen not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>out.</b> On 23 August 1936, {{it agreed}} to the Non-Intervention Agreement, and this was {{followed}} by a decree from Stalin banning exports of war material to Spain, thereby bringing the USSR into line with the Western Powers. Soviet foreign policy considered collective security against German fascism a priority [...] and the Comintern had agreed a similar approach in 1934. It walked a thin line between pleasing France and not being seen to hinder the World revolution and communist ideals. This was also {{the time of the first}} significant trials of the Old Bolsheviks in Russia. Soviet press and opposition groups were entirely against non-intervention; Soviet actions could hardly have been further from the goal of spreading the revolution.|$|E
500|$|The film {{makes some}} {{deviations}} from the book, but overall follows Tolkien's narrative quite closely. Of the adaptation process, Bakshi stated that elements of the story [...] "had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> but nothing in the story was really altered." [...] The film greatly condenses Frodo's journey from Bag End to Bree. Stop-overs at Farmer Maggot's house, Frodo's home in Buckland, and {{the house of the}} mysterious Tom Bombadil deep in the Old Forest are omitted. Maggot and his family and Bombadil and his wife Goldberry are thus all omitted, along with Fatty Bolger, a hobbit who accompanied Frodo at the beginning. According to Bakshi, the character of Tom Bombadil was [...] "dropped" [...] because [...] "he didn't move the story along." [...] Also the character Glorfindel is amalgamated with Legolas.|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} reasons why Ganteaume played no further Test cricket after his single match. Apart from {{the slow pace}} of his batting during that hundred—Goddard later suggested {{that it would have been}} better for Ganteaume's career to score a rapid 60 than a slow hundred— West Indies' batting was strong at the time and there was plenty of competition for places in the team. Even so, his teammate and later West Indies captain Jeff Stollmeyer suggested that he was unlucky <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> of subsequent teams. It is also possible that Ganteaume was affected by his attitude to authority. The cricket journalist Martin Williamson suggests: [...] "Ganteaume probably paid as much for his anti-establishment attitude as for slow scoring. He was certainly not someone who was going to bow and scrape to the white players who still dominated the region's cricket." [...] In later years, Ganteaume served as a Test selector and was West Indies manager in 1973–74. In 2007, his autobiography, My Story: The Other Side of the Coin was published, in which he criticised the West Indies [...] "establishment" [...] of his playing days. He died at the age of 95 on 17 February 2016. At the time of his death he was the oldest surviving West Indies Test cricketer, and the second oldest in the world.|$|E
500|$|The second Test {{was badly}} {{affected}} by weather and Hirst did not bat or bowl, {{and in the}} third Test in Sheffield, lost by England, he scored eight runs and did not take any wickets. Although he failed at Sheffield, Hirst was the leading all-rounder in England and thus unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> of the team. However, the England captain, Archie MacLaren, was engaged in a dispute with the team selectors over the composition of his side. He was given only 12 players to choose from for the fourth Test. Fred Tate {{was one of the}} twelve and the selectors probably included him as they believed MacLaren could not possibly choose him in the final eleven over another player and so would be forced to field the side they wanted. MacLaren responded by dropping Hirst to play Tate, out of anger towards the selectors. The pitch was soft, which would have favoured the bowling of Tate, but Wisden reported that while this offered some justification for dropping Hirst, [...] "it meant playing a bowler pure and simple in preference to a first-rate all-round man, and the result proved anything but happy." [...] Tate bowled just 16 overs in the game, dropped a vital catch and was the last man out as Australia won the match by three runs, giving them an unassailable lead in the series; later writers claimed that Tate's performance was responsible for losing the match.|$|E

2500|$|Bernd Heine {{argues that}} {{linguistic}} change {{is responsible for}} this language-specific variability in categorization. This is because [...] "rather than being a semantically defined category, inalienability {{is more likely to}} constitute a morphosyntactic or morphophonological entity, one that owes its existence to the fact that certain nouns happened <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> when a new pattern for marking attributive possession arose." [...] Under this view, nouns that are [...] "ignored" [...] by a new marking pattern come to form a separate noun class.|$|E
2500|$|Again England made {{multiple}} {{changes to}} the side from the previous Test. [...] This time, Smith, Emburey, Bicknell and Illot felt the chop from the selectors' axe, while Graham Thorpe had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> after a delivery from a 17-year-old net bowler broke his thumb, leading to coach Fletcher reporting the nets at The Oval as sub-standard. [...] In their places came the pace trio of Devon Malcolm, Angus Fraser and Steve Watkin, all making their first appearances of the series, and batsmen Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash. [...] Australia were unchanged again, as expected.|$|E
