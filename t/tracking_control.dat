50|$|Back in the 1970 several {{researchers}} developed a tethered electrohydraulic transfemoral prosthesis. It only included a hydraulically actuated knee joint controlled by off-board electronics using {{a type of}} control called echo control. Echo control tries to take the kinematics from the sound leg and control the prosthetic leg to match the intact leg when it reaches {{that part of the}} gait cycle. In 1988 a battery-powered active knee joint powered by DC motors and controlled by a robust position <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> algorithm was created by Popovic and Schwirtlich. <b>Tracking</b> <b>control</b> is a common method of control used to force a particular state, such as position, velocity, or torque, to track a particular trajectory. These are just two examples of previous work that has been done in this field.|$|E

5000|$|Iterative Learning Control (ILC) is {{a method}} of <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> for systems that work in a {{repetitive}} mode. Examples of systems that operate in a repetitive manner include robot arm manipulators, chemical batch processes and reliability testing rigs. In each of these tasks the system is required to perform the same action {{over and over again}} with high precision. This action is represented by the objective of accurately tracking a chosen reference signal [...] on a finite time interval.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of VHS, a linear control track at the tape's lower edge holds pulses that mark the {{beginning}} of every frame of video; these are used to fine-tune the tape speed during playback and to get the rotating heads exactly on their helical tracks rather than having them end up somewhere between two adjacent tracks. However, the exact distance between the rotating video head and the fixed head reading the linear track can vary by a couple of micrometers between machines due to manufacturing tolerances, so most machines offer a manual or automatic <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> to correct such mismatches.|$|E

50|$|One {{application}} of sliding mode controller is {{the control of}} electric drives operated by switching power converters. Because of the discontinuous operating mode of those converters, a discontinuous sliding mode controller is a natural implementation choice over continuous controllers that {{may need to be}} applied by means of pulse-width modulation or a similar technique of applying a continuous signal to an output that can only take discrete states. Sliding mode control has many applications in robotics. In particular, this control algorithm has been used for <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> of unmanned surface vessels in simulated rough seas with high degree of success.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the five main instruments, nine avionic subsystems were allocated to the bus module. [...] These were the Communication and Data-Handling Subsystem (C&DH), Inter-Orbit Communication Subsystem (IOCS), Mission Data Processing Subsystem (MDPS), Optical Data Recorder (ODR), Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS), Paddle Subsystem (PDL), Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem (AOCS), Reaction Control Subsystem (RCS), and the Direct Transmission Subsystem (DTL). The C&DH subsystem received and decoded the satellite's <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> command signals and acted as a processing interface between the instruments. It was capable of adjusting settings on the instruments [...] - [...] such as temperature and voltage. The IOCS was used to communicate with data relay satellites (see Data transfer).|$|E
5000|$|Dynamic Track Following (DTF) {{eliminated}} {{the need for}} a separate control track, and enabled the video heads to accurately follow the recorded tracks on the tape during playback. Therefore, by design V2000 machines does not require a video <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> (however, Grundig's model 1600 lacked DTF). During record, a sequence of four pilot frequencies is recorded with the video signal. During playback, if a video head reads an adjacent track, a voltage of up to Â± 150 volts is applied to the piezo-electric material on which the video heads are mounted. The flexible head mount enables the head to accurately read every track (ie, no noisebars), at up to seven times normal speed forwards, and fives times in reverse. VHS developers JVC later introduced a so-called [...] "Dynamic Drum" [...] in a few top-of-the-range devices.|$|E

5000|$|According to Palmieri, {{the main}} design {{philosophy}} behind {{the game was}} {{that it had to}} be comfortable, intuitive, and accessible. To learn about motion sickness, the team read NASA's documents on stroboscopic treatments, as well as information regarding the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The team later decided to use head movement as the game's primary control. Despite initial concerns that head movement would be a very clumsy way to control the character, they were impressed by the its precision after extensive playtesting, with Palmieri saying that the results [...] "went beyond their expectations". The team felt that head <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> was one of the simplest and most accessible ways for non-gamers to enjoy the game, as head movement is inborn and a player would not need to move their arms or learn how to use a traditional controller. In addition, this method of control is the most direct and natural because of its close proximity with the brain.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} playing an audio CD, {{touted as a}} digital audio storage medium, starts with the plastic {{polycarbonate}} compact disc, an analogue medium that contains the digitally encoded data. The disc is placed in a tray which either opens up (as with portable CD players) or slides out (the norm with in-home CD players, computer disc drives and game consoles). In some systems, the user slides the disc into a slot (e.g., car stereo CD players). Once the disc is loaded into the tray, the data is read out by a mechanism that scans the spiral data track using a laser beam. An electric motor spins the disc. The <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> is done by analogue servoamplifiers and then the high frequency analogue signal read from the disc is digitized, processed and decoded into analogue audio and digital control data which {{is used by the}} player to position the playback mechanism on the correct track, do the skip and seek functions and display track, time, index and, on newer players in the 2010s, display title and artist information on a display placed in the front panel.|$|E

It integrates a real-time vision-based target detection algorithm with a <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> law in a closed loop. First, the proposed target detection algorithm extracts geometry, color and motion features from captured images. Based on these features, a finite-state machine is then introduced to dynamically coordinates the work of decision making under the Bayes framework, and a <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> law is designed to minimize a certain tracking error function. Experimental results obtained from actual flight tests are also presented and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our vision-based <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> system in real scenes. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> of {{a surface}} vessel {{with only two}} control inputs. The surface vessel model has certain similarities with chained form systems, but cannot be transformed to chained form.

It is shown, however, that methods developed for <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> of chained form systems, can be used for developing a <b>tracking</b> <b>control</b> law for the surface vessel.
