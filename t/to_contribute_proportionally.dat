40|$|The {{evolution}} of the avian wing has long fascinated biologists, yet almost no work includes the length of primary feathers in consideration of overall wing length variation. Here we show that {{the length of the}} longest primary feather () contributing to overall wing length scales with negative allometry against total arm (ta = humerus+ulna+manus). The scaling exponent varied slightly, although not significantly so, depending on whether a species level analysis was used or phylogeny was controlled for using independent contrasts:. The scaling exponent was not significantly different from that predicted (0. 86) by earlier work. It appears that there is a general trend for the primary feathers of birds <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>proportionally</b> less, and ta proportionally more, to overall wingspan as this dimension increases. Wingspan in birds is constrained close to mass (M 1 / 3) because of optimisation for lift production, which limits opportunities for exterior morphological change. Within the wing, variations in underlying bone and feather lengths nevertheless may, in altering the joint positions, permit a range of different flight styles by facilitating variation in upstroke kinematics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Partial rootzone drying (PRD) is an {{irrigation}} technique {{where water}} is distributed unevenly {{to the root}} system such that part is irrigated while the remainder is allowed to dry the soil. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) plants were grown with their roots in two soil columns to compare the physiological consequences of alternation of wet and dry columns during PRD irrigation (alternate PRD, PRD-A) with retention of the same wet and dry columns (fixed PRD, PRD-F). When PRD plants received 50 % less water than well-watered (WW) plants, xylem ABA concentration ([X-ABA]) increased and stomatal conductance decreased relative toWW plants. Although both sets of PRD plants received {{the same amount of}} water, [X-ABA] of PRD-A plants increased up to 2 -fold above that of PRD-F plants, which further decreased stomatal conductance. Differences in [X-ABA] were detected within an hour of alternation, but did not persist beyond the photoperiod of alternation. [X-ABA] increased linearly as whole-pot soil water content (θpot) and leaf water potential (leaf) declined, but the difference in [X-ABA] between the two sets of PRD plants was not due to differences in either θpot or leaf. In PRD-F plants, the unwatered part of the root system contributes proportionally less to the transpiration stream as the soil progressively dries (Yao et al. 2001, Plant, Cell & Environment 24, 227 – 235).

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new method {{to set up}} energy performance requirements and energy classes for windows of all dimensions and configurations. The net energy gain of windows is the solar gain minus the heat loss integrated over the heating season. The net energy gain can be calculated for one orientation or averaged over different orientations. The averaged value {{may be used for}} energy labeling of windows of standard size. Requirements in building codes may also be based on the net energy gain instead of the thermal transmittance of the window. The size and the configuration of the window, i. e. number of glazing units, have a very large effect on the net energy gain. Therefore the energy labeling or the requirements based on the standard size may not give valid information on the energy performance of windows of non-standard size. The paper {{presents a}} method to set up requirements and classes for energy performance based on the net energy gain that includes the effect of window size and configuration.

40|$|ABSTRACT: How {{should the}} aid {{financial}} burden be distributed across donor governments? This article discusses the "distributive justice" {{of the current}} aid-financing pattern, and advocates a progressive modality in which citizens from donor countries with higher living standards <b>contribute</b> <b>proportionally</b> more than citizens from countries with lower living standards. For this purpose, we conceive public foreign aid as a tax mechanism for redistributing income on a worldwide scale. The progressivity analysis for 45 bilateral donors (28 DAC countries and 17 non-DAC donors) using concentration curves and Suits indexes between 2000 and 2012 shows that the current distribution of the aid burden is insufficiently progressive (mainly due to the limited contributions of the richer donors). Finally, we argue that a progressive exaction scheme will improve the distributive justice of the aid system...|$|R

In this paper we propose a distributed local-control algorithm that guarantees a fair workload distribution across the network. This approach ensures that each node will <b>contribute</b> <b>proportionally</b> <b>to</b> its available energy.

40|$|Perceptual studies make a clear {{distinction}} between sensitivity and decision criterion. The former is taken to characterize the processing efficiency of the underlying sensory system and it increases with stimulus strength. The latter is regarded as the manifestation of a subjective operation whereby individuals decide on (as opposed to react reflexively to) the occurrence of an event based on factors such as expectation and payoff, in addition to its strength. To do so, individuals need to have some knowledge of the internal response distributions evoked by this event or its absence. In a natural, behaviorally relevant multistimulus environment, observers must handle many such independent distributions to optimize their decision criteria. Here we show that they cannot do so. Instead, while leaving sensitivity unchanged, lower and higher visibility events tend to be reported respectively less and more frequently than when they are presented in isolation. This behavior is in quantitative agreement with predictions based on the notion that observers represent a multistimulus environment as a unitary internal distribution to which each stimulus <b>contributes</b> <b>proportionally</b> <b>to</b> its probability of occurrence.

The test is particularly valuable in that the creep compliance was independent of load, allowing the mechanical properties to be represented by a single total creep compliance curve which can be used to determine the various creep components.

40|$|Abstract—Peer-to-Peer {{streaming}} systems (or P 2 P-TV) {{have been}} studied in the literature for some time, and they are becoming popular among users as well. P 2 P-TV systems target the real time delivery of a video stream, therefore posing different challenges compared to more traditional P 2 P applications like the better known file sharing P 2 P application. In this paper, we focus on mesh based systems in which the peers form a generic overlay topology upon which peers exchange small “chunks ” of video. In particular, we study the signaling mechanisms that must be in place to trade chunks in a quick and efficient way, by automatically adapting a peer service rate to its upload capacity, and to match the demand from other peers. The goal is to maximize peer upload capacity utilization, while avoiding forming long transmission queue, therefore minimizing the chunk delivery time, a crucial parameter for P 2 P-TV systems. Our {{results show that the}} proposed solution achieves several desirable goals: i) it limits the overhead due to signaling messages, ii) it achieves a fair resource utilization, making peers <b>contribute</b> <b>proportionally</b> <b>to</b> their bandwidth, iii) it improves system perfor-mance, reducing loss probability and chunk delivery delay with respect to mechanisms with non adaptive number of contacted peers.

This hypothesis was examined {{in a pond}} phosphorus-fertilization experiment and two microcosm nutrient-fertilization experiments. (2) The relative contribution of autotrophs to ecosystem respiration, at a given nutrient availability, increases as light availability increases. This hypothesis was tested in three light by nutrient factorial microcosm experiments. Rates of total plankton community, bacterial (� 1 �m fraction), and phytoplankton (total � bacterial) respiration all increased as nutrient availability increased. The contribution of bacteria to community respiration ranged between � 10 and 90 %, with the highest contribution occurring under the most oligotrophic conditions. As light availability increased within each nutrient availability treatment, there was a similar decline in the contribution of bacteria to community respiration. Under oligotrophic conditions bacteria are better competitors for nutrients that limit both autotrophs and heterotrophs, but as nutrient availability increases, conditions become increasingly favorable for larger celled phytoplankton that have higher maximal nutrient uptake rates. As light availability increases, the relative contribution of phytoplankton to ecosystem respiration also increases. Light and nutrient availability are important regulators of the relative contributions of autotrophs and heterotrophs to ecosystem respiration, but the observed patterns are primarily driven by changes in phytoplankton production rates...|$|R

In this study we used a new passive sampler to measure the radiocarbon (14 C) and stable carbon (δ 13 C) isotopic composition of dissolved CO 2 {{for the first time in}} a peatland stream throughout a complete year (May 2010 – June 2011). The in-stream sampling system collected time-integrated samples of CO 2 continuously over approximately one month periods. The rate of CO 2 trapping was proportional to independently measured streamwater CO 2 concentrations, demonstrating that passive samplers can be used to estimate the time-averaged dissolved CO 2 concentration of streamwater. While there was little variation and no clear trend in δ 13 CO 2 values (suggesting a consistent CO 2 source), we found a clear temporal pattern in the 14 C concentration of dissolved CO 2. The 14 C age of CO 2 varied from 707 ± 35 to 1210 ± 39 years BP, with the youngest CO 2 in the autumn and oldest in spring/early summer. Mean stream discharge and 14 C content of dissolved CO 2 were positively correlated.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of animal societies {{in which some}} individuals forego direct reproduction to help others to reproduce poses an evolutionary paradox. Societies where all individuals reproduce equally and societies where a single individual completely monopolizes reproduction represent the end points of a continuum of variance in the reproductive output among group members. This led Sherman et al. (1995) to propose that cooperative breeding and eusociality (a term originally applied only to insects) are not discrete phenomena. Rather they form a continuum whose main difference {{is the extent to}} which individuals forego their own reproductive opportunity to help other members of the group. Here we present a new index: the eusociality index. It quantifies the decrease in direct reproduction of group members as a resut of altruistic acts directed to other members of the group (i. e. a measure of the level of eusociality). The rationale for this index lies in the fundamental duality of the reproductive process, in which organisms supply two distinct elements: (i) genetic material (genes); and (ii) power (energy). In non-eusocial animals, all individuals transmit genes and power in the same ratio (notwithstanding individual variance in offspring size and parental investment). By contrast, amongst eusocial animals some individuals <b>contribute</b> <b>proportionally</b> more <b>to</b> gene transfer, and others more to energy, resulting in high interindividual variation in the ratio of gene to power transfer...|$|R
