5|$|Mahavira {{taught that}} the soul exists, a premise that Jainism shares with Hinduism but not Buddhism. According to Buddhism, {{there is no}} soul or self, and its teachings {{are based on the}} concept of anatta. In contrast, Mahavira taught that <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> {{permanent}} and eternal with respect to dravya (substance). Mahavira additionally taught that <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> also impermanent with respect to paryaya (modes that originate and vanish).|$|E

5|$|To Mahavira, {{the metaphysical}} {{nature of the}} {{universe}} consists of dravya, jiva, and ajiva. The jiva gets attached and bound to samsara (wordly realms of suffering and existence) because of karma (activity). Karma, in Jainism, includes both actions and intent, and it colors (lesya) the soul; its particles stick to the soul and affect how, where, and what <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> instantaneously reborn into after a being dies.|$|E
40|$|Christianity organizes {{thinking}} about punishment around {{the value of}} love. Love requires {{a focus on the}} common good and on benefit to <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> or character.

5|$|Priestley {{strongly}} {{suggested that}} there is no mind-body duality, and put forth a materialist philosophy in these works; that is, one founded on the principle that everything in the universe is made of matter that we can perceive. He also contended that discussing <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> impossible because it is made of a divine substance, and humanity cannot perceive the divine. Despite his separation of the divine from the mortal, this position shocked and angered many of his readers, who believed that such a duality was necessary for the soul to exist.|$|E

2500|$|The ancient Greeks {{used the}} word [...] "alive" [...] for the concept of being [...] "ensouled", {{indicating}} that the earliest surviving western philosophical view believed that <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>was</b> that which gave the body life. <b>The</b> <b>soul</b> <b>was</b> considered <b>the</b> incorporeal or spiritual [...] "breath" [...] that animates (from the Latin, , cf.

25|$|A third {{interpretation}} {{relies on}} the theory that an individual form is capable of having properties of its own.

If that is the case, then <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> the body's form and yet thinking need not involve any bodily organ.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the time}} <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> liberated from the saṃsāra (cycle of {{repeated}} birth and death), it gets attached {{to one of}} these bodies based on the karma (actions) of the individual soul. Irrespective of which state <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> in, it has got the same attributes and qualities. The difference between the liberated and non-liberated souls is that the qualities and attributes are manifested completely in case of siddha (liberated soul) as they have overcome all the karmic bondages whereas in case of non-liberated souls they are partially exhibited.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, for true believers and the righteous, death {{will cause a}} feeling of love, then it's arrives and their souls will be aparted tender. When a righteous believer dies, bright-faced angels from heaven descends with divine perfume and shroud. Then the angel of death comes, and tells the soul {{to come out to}} the {{pleasure}} and mercy of God. <b>The</b> <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> then extracted as easily as water comes out from the pitcher. <b>The</b> <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> then wrapped in the perfumed shroud and is taken up to the seventh heaven where God declares: 'write down his name in 'Illiyin' and take him back to earth.

25|$|In 1735, in Leipzig, he {{published}} a three-volume work, Opera philosophica et mineralis ("Philosophical and mineralogical works") {{in which he}} tried to conjoin philosophy and metallurgy. The work was mainly appreciated for its chapters on {{the analysis of the}} smelting of iron and copper, and it was the work that gave Swedenborg his international reputation. The same year, he also published the small manuscript de Infinito ("On the Infinite") in which he attempted to explain how the finite is related to the infinite and how <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> connected to the body. It was the first manuscript in which he touched upon such matters. He knew that it might clash with established theologies since he presented the view that <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> based on material substances. He also conducted dedicated studies of the fashionable philosophers of the time such as John Locke, Christian von Wolff, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and Descartes and earlier thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus and Augustine of Hippo.|$|E
25|$|In his commentary, {{the first}} bird {{represents}} the individual soul, {{while the second}} represents Brahman or God. <b>The</b> <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> essentially a reflection of Brahman.

25|$|According to Jainism, Soul is {{the master}} of its own destiny. One of the qualities of <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>is</b> {{complete}} lordship of its own destiny.

Furthermore, it is the soul alone who makes the necessary efforts to achieve liberation without any divine grace.|$|E
