25|$|<b>Tinplate</b> {{consists}} of sheet iron coated with tin {{and then run}} through rollers. This process was first discovered in the 16th century, {{with the development of}} British <b>tinplate</b> address in 1661 with a patent to Dud Dudley and William Chamberlayne. Previously Great Britain had imported most <b>tinplate</b> from Hamburg.|$|E
25|$|The British Iron Act of 1750 {{prohibited}} (among other things) the erection of new rolling mills, which {{prevented the}} erection of new <b>tinplate</b> works in America {{until after the}} American Revolution. Certificates submitted by colonial governors to the British Board of Trade following the Act indicate that no <b>tinplate</b> works then existed though there were several slitting mills, some described as slitting and rolling mills.|$|E

40|$|Tin electrocoated steel strip, also {{referred}} to as Flandres foil, is largely used for manufacturing food containers. <b>Tinplates</b> must have good corrosion resistance, workability, weldability, as well as a bright appearance. The woodgrain defect, a not yet fully understood defect that occurs on <b>tinplates</b> and accounts for their high scrap rate, consists of alternate bands of bright/dull reflectivity and resembles longitudinally cut wood. Observations of the woodgrain defect by scanning electron microscopy showed that the molten tin spreads irregularly during both the melting and solidification stages. X-ray diffraction analyses showed that the metallic tin tended to crystallize in the (200) direction for coupons with and without the woodgrain defect. Nevertheless, the preferential orientation degree decreased for coupons with the woodgrain defect. The rocking curves, also known as omega-scan, showed that the tin grains were uniformly aligned parallel to the strip surface for coupons with no defects, whereas for <b>tinplates</b> with woodgrain, the tin grains were not uniformly oriented, probably due to the misalignment of the grains in relation to the surface.

50|$|Terne {{plate is}} a form of tinplate: a thin steel sheet coated with an alloy of lead and tin. The terne alloy was in the ratio of 10-20% tin and the {{remainder}} lead. The low tin content made it cheaper than other <b>tinplates.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of intermetallic phases influences {{the properties of}} commercial alloys. CEMS {{can be used to}} reveal the presence of Fe-Sn intermetallics at the interface on <b>tinplated</b> steels. The work presented investigates the sensitivity of CEMS to detect intermetallics. Varying amounts of Fe-Sn intermetallics have been identified by CEMS having been produced by heat treating samples of <b>tinplated</b> steel at selected temperatures and times. The effect of surface roughness of the substrate on the Mossbauer signal has also been investigated. The intermetallic formation was found to reach a limiting value with increased heat treatment. Using CEMS, intermetallic formation was observed at temperatures as low as 190 degreesC. Sample roughness was found to affect intermetallic formation and their observation using CEMS and GA-XRD...|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of <b>tinplate</b> {{and improvements in}} machine tools enabled significant advances in ship modelling from 1900 onwards. Thin, workable sheets of iron could be coated with tin to prevent rusting, then mass-produced as parts of ship model kits. The process was pioneered by French ship model manufacturer Radiguet, which produced a line of zinc boats with pressurised steam engines, wooden decking and brass fittings. The speed of production for <b>tinplate</b> vessels enabled one 1909 manufacturer to produce ship models of speedboats that had competed that year in Monaco.|$|E
25|$|Meccano {{introduced}} its OO scale trains in 1938 {{under the name}} 'Hornby Dublo'. The locomotives were diecast metal, and the carriages and wagons were generally made of <b>tinplate.</b> This was a very well planned range of electric and clockwork models, successfully consolidating 12V DC as the standard for OO scale. This led {{to the adoption of}} OO as a broadly accepted modelling standard in the UK, whereas {{much of the rest of}} the world adopted HO scale. As for their O gauge locomotives, electric Hornby Dublo locomotives ran on a third rail electric system with the track built on a pressed <b>tinplate</b> base.|$|E

5000|$|The 1874-model {{was made}} of <b>tinplated</b> steel and had a [...] "D" [...] plan view with rounded corners. The tray or cup piece had a folding handle that opened to the side. The tray also functioned as a deep lid for the pan. This change from the 1854-model allowed {{the use of the}} narrow and tighter curved side of the cup rim for drinking. It also {{permitted}} the tray to briefly be held over a fire. The corners of the square shaped bail were also more rounded. The geometry of the older British mess tins was substantially different. The 1854-model was [...] "D" [...] shaped in plan view and {{was made of}} <b>tinplated</b> iron. It was fabricated from front and back panels of sheet metal. The tray or cup nested inside the pan.

50|$|The {{principal}} architectural uses of tin {{fall into}} two categories: the alloying of tin with other metals such as copper to form bronze, and the coating of tin on harder metals, such as <b>tinplated</b> iron or steel. Architectural bronzes usually contain about 90% copper and 10% tin, although the content may vary widely. The term “tin ceiling” is a misnomer, as these decorative sheets were never tinned; they were almost always painted sheet iron or steel.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} a {{description}} is given of a method {{developed for the}} purpose of removing sur-face layers from plated materials. The principle of separation is based on the difference in vapour pressures and stabilities with the formation of metal chlorides. A series of pyrolytic experiments was car-ried out with different combinations of electroplated materials in an atmosphere of gaseous HCI. The HCI was produced by pyrolyzing scrap polyvinyl chloride. Specimens of <b>tinplated</b> copperwire and steelplate, galvanised steel and chromed copper, were treated in this way with the result that most of the tin, zinc and chromium were preferentially removed, leaving the steel and copper almost unattacked...|$|R

The solubility of the precipitate was observed to be related to its morphology. It is suggested that this {{may be the result of}} an a/ 3 transformation in the hydrous stannic oxides. However, morphology was not the sole reason for changes in solubility as demonstrated by the affect of impurities.

40|$|In {{this highly}} {{competitive}} market where {{the demand for}} the products is increasing gradually, {{it is essential for}} a manufacturing company to reduce the production cycle time and cost accordingly. One of the methods for this is to increase the availability of process. This paper attempts to identify and quantify the causes of machine downtime in a manufacturing company. For this a four-prong approach is taken: Firstly, the major causes for the low availability of process are determined, where bearing failure is found to be the major causes of low availability. Second, combining desirability function approach and data envelopment analysis are performed to identify the sensitive input variables that affect the bearing failure. Thirdly, ordinary linear regression is used to validate the results of DEA. Lastly, some managerial implications to reduce the downtime were suggested. We have considered an electrolytic <b>tinplating</b> line process in a tin sheet manufacturing company as a case study. data envelopment analysis; DEA; linear regression; machine availability; machine downtime; desirability function; bottleneck identification; bottlenecks; manufacturing equipment; bearing failure; electrolytic tinplating; tin sheet manufacturing. ...|$|R
25|$|The branch {{involved}} a substantial {{bridge over the}} river Wye, 207 feet in length, but was nevertheless ready for traffic on 6 August 1875, although the Wye Valley Railway main line was not yet open.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 69 - 77) Effect {{of processing}} and storage on folacin content of green beans canned in <b>tinplated</b> cans and retortable pouches, under home canning conditions were studied. Blanching resulted in retentions of 51. 5 percent of free folacin (FFA) and 81. 4 {{percent of total}} folacin (TFA). Due to leaching, 0. 9 percent FFA and 15. 3 percent TFA were detected in the blanching water. The heat processing itself and leaching caused no significant reduction in FFA in either type of package. The TFA retention following sterilization was 75 percent in cans and 73. 9 percent in pouches. As {{a result of a}} higher liquid to solid ratio, leaching of TFA was higher in cans than in pouches. During 12 weeks of storage, the FFA content of canned green beans decreased significantly (p< 0. 5), whereas the corresponding reduction in pouched green beans was not significant. The concentration of FFA in the brine portion of both types of packages increased initially, then reduced slightly and finally stabilized after the third week of storage. (See more in text. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the 16 th Century, {{there has}} been Travelling {{families}} in Sweden, earning their living by itinerant trades such as horse-trading, scrap-metal-dealing and <b>tinplating.</b> The authorities often labelled these families “tattare”. They suffered from severe discrimination, and authorities as well as scientists claimed {{that they were a}} threat against society. These claims were often made with a racialized rhetoric. In the period ca 1880 - 1955, there was a heated debate on what kind of political measures should be taken against these families. This debate, which {{is the subject of this}} thesis, was sometimes referred to as the ‘tattare question’. Three main political strategies were proposed or adopted in the ‘tattare’ question. In the countryside, small rural districts invented a variety of techniques in order to exclude Travelling families, such as imposing fines on persons who accommodated them. Government authorities and philanthropist saw assimilation as a goal rather than exclusion. They proposed various types of programs, e. g. establishing orphanages in which children labelled as ‘tattare’ should be detained and transformed into “decent” and “hard-working” citizens. Especially in the 1930 ’s and 1940 ’s, there were also proposals for a policy of more or less complete extinction of the whole group. In these proposals, persons labelled as ‘tattare’ were to be systematically sterilized. Although none of these extreme proposals were carried out, the debate did without a doubt influence the implementation of the general sterilization and childcare acts. Many persons whom the authorities labelled as ‘tattare’ were sterilized or detained at closed institutions for children and juveniles in the 20 th century...|$|R
5000|$|Cast iron was unwieldy, heavy, and not well-suited to proper detail or model {{proportions}} {{and gradually}} it {{was replaced by}} pressed tin (Richardson 1999, p. 67). Marx offered a variety of tin vehicles, from carts to dirigibles — the company would lithograph toy patterns on large sheets of <b>tinplated</b> steel. These would then be stamped, die-cut, folded, and assembled (Vintage Marx 2015). Marx was long known for its car and truck toys, and the company would take small steps to renew the popularity of an old product. In the 1920s, an old truck toy that was falling behind in sales was loaded with plastic ice cubes and the company had a new hit (Time Magazine 1955). The Honeymoon Express, a wind-up train on track with a plane circling above, later became the Mickey Mouse Express and then the Subway Express. Popeye pushing a barrel of spinach eventually became the 1940 Tidy Tim Street Cleaner and Charlie McCarthy in his [...] "Benzine Buggy" [...] (Vintage Marx 2015; Richardson 1999, p. 66). Some {{of the most popular}} vehicles were Crazy Cars like the Funny Flivver of 1926 - another was the eloping [...] "Joy Riders" [...] (Richardson 1998, p. 43). One earlier and much sought after tin toy was an open Amos 'n Andy Ford Model T four door, as well as another Model T with driver apparently on a European jaunt and hauling a trunk at the rear with the names of various European cities on it. This model was produced in a variety of liveries (Richardson 1999, pp. 43, 63). Lithographed tin tanks, airplanes, police motorcycles, tractors, trains, luxury liners, and rocket ships were all produced in bright colors. One toy, the Tricky Taxi seems to have had origins in a Heinrich Muller toy from Nuremberg in Germany (Richardson 1999, p. 63). The 1935 G-Man pursuit car was possibly the largest vehicle Marx ever made at 14 1/2 inches long (Richardson 1999, p. 66). Even doll houses, gasoline stations, parking lots and street scenes were made in tin (Richardson 1999, p. 66). That Marx was doing well even in the depression is shown by the date of introduction of their well-known motorcycle cop toy - 1933 (Richardson 1999, p. 44).|$|R
