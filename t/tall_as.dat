5|$|Although skull {{proportions}} varied, abelisaurid skulls {{were generally}} very tall and very short in length. In Carnotaurus, for example, the skull {{was nearly as}} <b>tall</b> <b>as</b> it was long. The premaxilla in abelisaurids was very tall, so {{the front of the}} snout was blunt, not tapered as seen in many other theropods.|$|E
5|$|Like other hadrosaurids, it {{was able}} to walk on either two legs or four. It {{probably}} preferred to forage for food on four legs, but ran on two. The neural spines of the vertebrae were <b>tall,</b> <b>as</b> was common in lambeosaurines; tallest over the hips, they increased the height of the back. Skin impressions are known for P. walkeri, showing uniform tubercle-like scales but no larger structures.|$|E

5|$|Narcissus is a genus of {{perennial}} herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes, dying {{back after}} flowering to an underground storage bulb. They regrow {{in the following}} year from brown-skinned ovoid bulbs with pronounced necks, and reach heights of 5–80cm depending on the species. Dwarf species such as N. asturiensis have a maximum height of 5–8cm, while Narcissus tazetta may grow as <b>tall</b> <b>as</b> 80cm.|$|E
5|$|The three named {{species of}} Gryposaurus differ in {{details of the}} skull and lower jaw. The {{prominent}} nasal arch found in this genus is formed from the paired nasal bones. In profile view, they rise into a rounded hump {{in front of the}} eyes, reaching a height as <b>tall</b> <b>as</b> the highest point {{of the back of the}} skull. The skeleton is known in great detail, making it a useful point of reference for other duckbill skeletons.|$|E
5|$|The Kathiawari {{is closely}} related to the Marwari breed from the Marwar region of Rajasthan, which borders with {{northern}} Gujarat. Genetic diversity analysis groups the two breeds, while the other four Indian horse breeds – the Bhutia, the Manipuri, the Spiti and the Zaniskari – form a distinct and separate group. The Kathiawari and the Marwari are also phenotypically similar; in particular, they have the same unusual in-curved ears. The Kathiawari is not as <b>tall</b> <b>as</b> the Marwari, and has a smaller thoracic circumference; it is most commonly chestnut, while the Marwari is usually black. Kathiawaris tend to have slight facial differences from the Marwari. The Kathiawari also resembles the Arab horse, which contributed significantly during the development of the breed.|$|E

5|$|The main ore {{of mercury}} is cinnabar, long {{used as a}} pigment by painters. He says that the colour is similar to scolecium, {{probably}} the kermes insect. The dust is very toxic, so workers handling the material wear face masks of bladder skin. Copper and bronze are, says Pliny, most famous for their use in statues including colossi, gigantic statues as <b>tall</b> <b>as</b> towers, the most famous being the Colossus of Rhodes. He personally saw the massive statue of Nero in Rome, which was removed after the emperor's death. The face of the statue was modified shortly after Nero's death during Vespasian's reign, {{to make it a}} statue of Sol. Hadrian moved it, {{with the help of the}} architect Decrianus and 24 elephants, to a position next to the Flavian Amphitheatre (now called the Colosseum).|$|E
5|$|All of the fins, {{particularly}} the narrow pectoral fins, are falcate (sickle-shaped) to some degree. The medium-sized first dorsal fin originates {{just behind the}} pectoral fin rear tips. The second dorsal fin is about two-thirds as <b>tall</b> <b>as</b> the first, {{and there is no}} midline ridge running between them. The pelvic fins are broad and slightly larger than the anal fin. The anal fin has a strong notch in the trailing margin and is positioned slightly behind the second dorsal fin. The caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the upper origin of the caudal fin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The prominent lateral line curves downward below the second dorsal fin. The skin is densely covered by small, overlapping dermal denticles; each bears five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is light grey to bronze above, darkening at the tips of the second dorsal fin and upper caudal fin lobe (though this may be indistinct in larger sharks), and pale below. The underside is off-white, and the first dorsal fin has a pale trailing margin.|$|E
5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Edward was an eighteen-year-old teenager travelling alongside his father whose soul sealed in a flying squirrel. Edward's prototype {{had an average}} height, but retained his automail. In order to fit with the readers from the manga magazine Monthly Shonen Gangan, Edward's traits were further modified, leaving his current one. His height was reduced in order to contrast with Alphonse's huge armor. In {{the design of the}} character, Arakawa is often worried about not making his automail too bulky to avoid balancing it by increasing Edward's muscles, making his appearance unsuitable for his age. She has also often drawn the character in full body length, but at one point noticed she made it too <b>tall.</b> <b>As</b> the manga continued serialization, Arakawa found that she drew Edward half naked several times even more than Alex Louis Armstrong who tends to show his torso. While stating that this was because she wanted to draw Edward's automail, she commented that it was common for men to walk in underwear at their homes.|$|E

50|$|The roof comb is 12.86 m {{high and}} {{consists}} of three distinct levels. The massive bulk of the roof comb was lightened by internal chambers, with four being built into {{each of the three}} levels. The roof comb was originally somewhat <b>taller</b> <b>as</b> evidenced by the bases of three smaller architectural elements on top.|$|R
5|$|The Temple of Awilix is on {{the east}} side of the plaza. Awilix was the patron goddess of the Nijaib lineage and is {{identified}} with Ixbalanque, one of the Hero Twins from the Popul Vuh. According to a drawing made by Rivera y Maestre, the temple of Awilix was not as <b>tall</b> <b>as</b> the temple of Tohil. This structure was apparently the second most important temple in Q'umarkaj. Originally this temple was formed of a large rectangular platform supporting a smaller platform and a temple structure {{on the east side}}. A wide stairway climbed the west side of the temple, it was flanked on the lower level by two large talud-tablero panels. The exterior stonework of the building has been completely stripped away. The temple is similar in form to a temple mound on the west side of the first plaza in Iximche, the postclassic capital of the Kaqchikel Maya. There were four principal phases of construction and there is evidence that the temple had been repaired various times prior to the Conquest. The floor under the third phase of construction had been painted dark green. Archaeological investigations found fragments of incense burners underneath the first building phase.|$|E
5|$|The fins are {{strongly}} falcate (sickle-shaped), particularly the dorsal fins, pelvic fins, and lower caudal fin lobe. The pectoral fins are narrow and pointed. The first dorsal fin is positioned about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic fins. The second dorsal fin is about two-thirds as <b>tall</b> <b>as</b> the first and is positioned slightly ahead of the anal fin. The anal fin is smaller than the second dorsal fin. The dorsal surface of the caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping; each has five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is light grey or bronze above, often with small white spots on the sides, and pale below. The dorsal fins are tipped in white, which is especially obvious on the second dorsal as the remainder of fin is mostly dark.|$|E
5|$|The retiarius was {{routinely}} {{pitted against}} a heavily armed secutor. The net-fighter {{made up for}} his lack of protective gear by using his speed and agility to avoid his opponent's attacks {{and waiting for the}} opportunity to strike. He first tried to throw his net over his rival. If this succeeded, he attacked with his trident while his adversary was entangled. Another tactic was to ensnare his enemy's weapon in the net and pull it out of his grasp, leaving the opponent defenseless. Should the net miss or the secutor grab hold of it, the retiarius likely discarded the weapon, although he might try to collect it back for a second cast. Usually, the retiarius had to rely on his trident and dagger to finish the fight. The trident, as <b>tall</b> <b>as</b> a human being, permitted the gladiator to jab quickly and keep his distance. It was a strong weapon, capable of inflicting piercing wounds on an unprotected skull or limb. The dagger was the retiariuss final backup should the trident be lost. It was reserved for when close combat or a straight wrestling match had to settle the bout. In some battles, a single retiarius faced two secutores simultaneously. For these situations, the lightly armoured gladiator was placed on a raised platform and given a supply of stones with which to repel his pursuers.|$|E
