5|$|Corbulo {{was given}} control over two provinces, Cappadocia and Galatia (modern-day central Turkey), with propraetorial and later proconsular {{authority}} or imperium. Although Galatia {{was considered a}} good recruiting-ground and Cappadocia had a few units of auxiliaries, <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army came from Syria, where half the garrison of four legions and several units of auxiliaries was transferred to his command.|$|E
5|$|According to Filitti, the war {{spelled out}} {{the end of}} Romania's aristocratic order, leaving the country prey to the nouveaux riches and the neo-Jacobins. As the Conservative Party itself {{collapsed}} into obscurity, he remained largely {{cut off from the}} outside world, and rejected many of the recent innovations. Reportedly, he wrote all his books and articles in dip pen, and never watched a motion picture. After 1919, he had to recover from financial ruin, having entrusted <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> assets (what had not been lost in the war) to a broker, who gambled it away and then committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Although Fannin, Dimmitt, and Linn {{continued}} {{to push for}} an attack on Goliad, Texian attention soon shifted towards Gonzales, where {{a small group of}} Texians were refusing to obey orders from Ugartechea. Colonists eagerly rushed to assist, and on October 2 the Battle of Gonzales officially opened the Texas Revolution. After learning of the Texian victory, Cos made haste for Béxar. He left with <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soldiers on October 5, but because he was unable to find adequate transportation most of his supplies remained at La Bahía.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> vast <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{professional}} career was connected with Osasuna, {{where he was}} charged with penalty-taking in his beginnings and for which he appeared in 513 competitive games.|$|R
50|$|As for Nogi, {{after leaving}} a {{garrison}} in Port Arthur, he led <b>the</b> surviving <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army <b>of</b> 120,000 men north to join Marshal Oyama at the Battle of Mukden.|$|R
60|$|Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering {{down upon}} {{us from the}} head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether, in the long course <b>of</b> <b>his</b> generations, he has not {{degenerated}} from <b>the</b> original <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sires.|$|R
5|$|As allied {{intentions}} became clear, General Pigot {{decided to}} redeploy his {{forces in a}} defensive posture, withdrawing troops from Conanicut Island and from Butts Hill. He also decided to move nearly all livestock into the city, ordered the levelling of orchards to provide a clear line of fire, and destroyed carriages and wagons. The arriving French ships drove several of his supporting ships aground, which were then burned to prevent their capture. As the French worked {{their way up the}} channel toward Newport, Pigot ordered the remaining ships scuttled to hamper French access to Newport's harbour. On 8 August d'Estaing moved <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fleet into Newport Harbour.|$|E
5|$|Brock felt {{he needed}} to go further. He was {{hampered}} by Governor General George Prevost, who had replaced Craig in late 1811. Prevost's orders from the government, and his own inclinations, were to emphasise defence. Prevost kept <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forces in Lower Canada to protect Quebec, and opposed any attack into United States. Brock also believed that he was handicapped by inertia and defeatism among the Legislature and other officials.|$|E
5|$|From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, {{one of the}} Achaemenid capitals, and {{captured}} its treasury. He sent <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Persian Royal Road. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He then stormed the pass of the Persian Gates (in the modern Zagros Mountains) which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.|$|E
50|$|After the season, Art Modell officially {{transferred}} <b>the</b> remaining <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ownership to Bisciotti, ending over 40 {{years of}} tenure as an NFL franchise majority owner. Modell still held an {{office at the}} Ravens' headquarters in Owings Mills, Maryland, and remained with the team as a consultant.|$|R
50|$|Hart also {{operated}} {{a store in}} Trois-Rivières, where he conducted a diverse wholesale and retail business. He made commercial and real estate loans throughout a wide area around the town. Prospering by these diverse operations, he bequeathed a huge legacy to his and Catherine's eight children; his four sons inherited <b>the</b> vast <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> estate, while his four daughters received £1,000 each.|$|R
50|$|Ernst Wilhelm Emanuel Stenhammar (26 March 1859 - 9 March 1927) was a Swedish {{architect}}. He {{was the son}} of {{the architect}} and composer Per Ulrik Stenhammar and brother of the composer Wilhelm Stenhammar. He was active both as an independent architect and as a teacher and eventually professor of architecture in Stockholm. <b>The</b> main <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> designs as an independent architect were made for banks and hospitals.|$|R
5|$|Kublai {{continued}} the assault against the Song, gaining a temporary foothold {{on the southern}} banks of the Yangtze. Kublai made preparations to take Ezhou, but a pending civil war with his brother Ariq Böke—a rival claimant to the Mongol Khaganate—forced Kublai to move back north with <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forces. In Kublai's absence, the Song forces were ordered by Chancellor Jia Sidao to make an immediate assault and succeeded in pushing the Mongol forces back to the northern banks of the Yangtze. There were minor border skirmishes until 1265, when Kublai won a significant battle in Sichuan.|$|E
5|$|The 182nd Paratrooper Brigade, {{comprising}} the 81st, 85th and 89th Battalions (each composed of three companies) {{under the command}} of Colonel Ismail Azmy, was assigned responsibility for defending the area south of Ismailia against an Israeli offensive. Azmy arrived at Nafisha with <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brigade at midnight on October 17, where he was briefed by Brigadier General Abd el-Munim Khalil, commander of Second Army. Khalil identified the west bank strong points as objectives for the paratroopers to secure, as the ramparts could be used to provide fire support to Egyptian forces on the east bank. The paratroopers would also hold Serabaeum and the bridges there over the Sweetwater Canal.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Standard, as the {{encounter}} {{came to be}} called, was a defeat for the Scots. Afterwards, David and his surviving notables retired to Carlisle. Although {{the result was a}} defeat, it was not by any means decisive. David retained <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army and thus the power to go on the offensive again. The siege of Wark, for instance, which had been going on since January, continued until it was captured in November. David continued to occupy Cumberland as well as much of Northumberland.|$|E
50|$|Morris's book, The Genesis Flood, coauthored by John C. Whitcomb, {{was very}} {{influential}} on modern creationist belief, {{and by the}} time of Morris's death, it was in its 44th printing and sold 250,000 English copies. While <b>the</b> greater <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> published writings address creation science and evolution themes, he had also written Many Infallible Proofs, and The Bible Has The Answer, which are both works of general Christian apologetics.|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, Glenn Bray, a {{publisher}} {{who had previously}} specialized {{in the work of}} Mad Magazine artist Basil Wolverton, befriended him and later published one book of Szukalski's art, Inner Portraits (1980), and another <b>of</b> <b>his</b> art and philosophy, A Trough Full of Pearls / Behold! The Protong (1982). Bray and his wife Lena Zwalve maintain Szukalski's estate and <b>the</b> great <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> existing art under the name [...] "Archives Szukalski." ...|$|R
50|$|Murphy {{was born}} in Merced, California, about 120 miles from Oakland. After graduating from Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster, California, Murphy was drafted in the 15th round in the 1973 draft by the Oakland Athletics, after turning down a {{football}} scholarship from Arizona State University. He {{came up to the}} majors {{for the first time in}} 1978 at age 23. He would spend <b>the</b> large <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career with Oakland.|$|R
5|$|The French {{started their}} rule by {{sentencing}} 21 nationalist leaders, including Quwatli, {{to death on}} 1 August 1920. Quwatli managed to flee only hours before a warrant for his arrest was issued. From Damascus he fled by car to Haifa in British-mandated Palestine, and soon after to Cairo in Egypt. From there, Quwatli spent <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time traveling throughout the Arab world and Europe serving as the virtual ambassador of the Syrian-Palestinian Congress. He became the chief link between Arab nationalist activists in Europe and in the Arab world.|$|E
5|$|The King lent {{support to}} Fisher, {{in part because}} he disliked Beresford, and {{eventually}} Beresford was dismissed. Beresford continued his campaign outside of the navy and Fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909, although <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> policies were retained. The King was intimately involved in the appointment of Fisher's successor as the Fisher-Beresford feud had split the service, and the only truly qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson, who had retired in 1907. Wilson was reluctant to return to active duty, but Edward persuaded him to do so, and Wilson became First Sea Lord on 25 January 1910.|$|E
5|$|The {{commissioning}} of Cossa's tomb monument {{was negotiated}} {{for about a}} decade following Cossa's death. Cossa's last will and testament—written on his death bed on December 22, 1419—made several of the customary Florentine civic bequests, acts of charity, and traditional ecclesiastical courtesies, but <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> estate was left to his nephews Michele and Giovanni. The bequests to his nephews took priority, and his estate remained disputed by various creditors while the tomb was being completed.|$|E
50|$|Heinrich Gustav Magnus (2 May 1802 - 4 April 1870) was {{a notable}} {{experimental}} scientist. His training was mostly in chemistry but his later research was mostly in physics. He spent <b>the</b> great <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career at <b>the</b> University of Berlin, {{where he is}} remembered for his laboratory teaching as much as for his original research. He did not use his first given name, and was known throughout his life as Gustav Magnus.|$|R
40|$|Judging from merely {{external}} considerations, the Books Contra Eunomium constitute one of {{the most}} important sources for the understanding of the thought and doctrine of St. Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa. They form <b>the</b> greater <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dogmatic writings; and they were written to carry on the work <b>of</b> <b>his</b> older brother and «master», St. Basil of Caesarea, whose untimely death on January 1, 379, launched Gregory to be {{one of the}} foremost leaders of Orthodoxy...|$|R
5000|$|The account <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{tenure in}} the Liber Pontificalis, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> {{overwhelming}} <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> surviving correspondence, is dominated by efforts to restore communion between the Sees of Rome and Constantinople caused by the Acacian schism. This schism was the consequence of the [...] "Henoticon" [...] of the Emperor Zeno and supported by his successor Anastasius, who {{became more and more}} inclined towards Monophysitism and persecuted those bishops who refused to repudiate the Council of Chalcedon.|$|R
5|$|While {{still in}} Madras, Ramanujan {{recorded}} <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> results in four notebooks of loose-leaf paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations. This {{is probably the}} origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician Bruce C. Berndt, in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17, 1776, commander-in-chief General George Washington brought the Continental Army {{to defend the}} port city of New York, then limited to the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the city's harbor would provide an excellent base for the British Navy during the campaign, so he established defenses there and waited for the British to attack. In July, the British under the command of General William Howe landed a few miles across the harbor from Manhattan on the sparsely-populated Staten Island, where they were slowly reinforced by ships in Lower New York Bay during the next month and a half, bringing their total force to 32,000 troops. Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city with the British fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at the Narrows, and he moved <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forces to Manhattan, believing that {{it would be the first}} target.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} day's {{progress}} was slower than expected, Operation Tractable resumed on 15 August; both armoured divisions pushed southeast toward Falaise. The Canadian 2nd and 3rd Infantry Divisions—with {{the support of}} the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade—continued their drive south towards the town. After harsh fighting, the 4th Armoured Division captured Soulangy but the gains made were minimal as strong German resistance prevented a breakthrough to Trun. On 16 August, the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division broke into Falaise, encountering minor opposition from Waffen-SS units and scattered pockets of German infantry. Although it would take two more days to clear all resistance in the town, the first major objective of Operation Tractable had been achieved. Simonds began to reorganize <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> armoured forces for a renewed push towards Trun to close the Falaise Pocket.|$|E
60|$|What mad fanatic Burley, what god-succoured insolent Achilles, {{ever had}} such cause to swell with wrath as {{at that moment}} had Dr Fillgrave? Had I the pen of Moliere, I could fitly tell of such medical anger, but with no other pen can it be fitly told. He did swell, and when <b>the</b> huge <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wrath was added to his natural proportions, he loomed {{gigantic}} before {{the eyes of the}} surrounding followers of Sir Roger.|$|R
5000|$|Steadman has {{expressed}} regret at selling the illustrations, at the advice <b>of</b> <b>his</b> agent to Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner for {{the sum of}} $75. As {{a result of that}} transaction Steadman has largely refused to sell any <b>of</b> <b>his</b> original artwork and has been quoted as saying [...] "If anyone owns a Steadman original, it's stolen." [...] While there are original pieces held outside his archive, they are exceedingly rare. The artist has kept possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vast <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> artwork.|$|R
60|$|The {{discourse}} {{between the}} Señor Montefalderon and Mulford was interesting, as it ever has been when the former spoke <b>of</b> <b>his</b> unfortunate country. On {{the subject of}} the battles of May he was candid, and admitted his deep mortification and regrets. He had expected more from the force collected on the Rio Grande, though, understanding the northern character better than most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> countrymen, he had not been as much taken by surprise as <b>the</b> great <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own nation.|$|R
5|$|Harold {{had spent}} mid-1066 {{on the south}} coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William to invade. <b>The</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forces were militia who needed to harvest their crops, so on 8 September Harold {{dismissed}} the militia and the fleet. Learning of the Norwegian invasion he rushed north, gathering forces as he went, and took the Norwegians by surprise, defeating them at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Harald Hardrada and Tostig were killed, and the Norwegians suffered such great losses that only 24 of the original 300 ships were required to carry away the survivors. The English victory came at great cost, as Harold's army was left in a battered and weakened state.|$|E
5|$|In 1344, the regency {{concluded}} a further alliance with Bulgaria, which required {{the surrender of}} Philippopolis (Plovdiv) and nine other towns in northern Thrace along the river Evros. Nevertheless, after their occupation, Ivan Alexander refrained from direct action against Kantakouzenos' forces operating in southern and eastern Thrace. At the same time, Momchil, a former brigand whom Kantakouzenos had entrusted with control over the region of Merope in the Rhodope mountains, switched over to the regency. In early 1344, Kantakouzenos was deprived of Umur and <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army, who had sailed home to repel a Latin attack on his main harbour, Smyrna. On their way, the Turkish force was attacked by the Serbs under Gregory Preljub, but prevailed at the Battle of Stephaniana. Nevertheless, Kantakouzenos was able to ward off joint attacks by Dušan and Apokaukos until Umur returned to his aid the next spring {{at the head of}} an army of 20,000men.|$|E
5|$|In 1503, Cairano {{made the}} last {{deliveries}} in the Caesar cycle {{for the front}} of the Loggia palace, and finished up <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work on the site; no further records of his presence exist. For the artist, this was the end of his big public commissions, which he probably gained before establishing his career and subsequent success. He now had to reorganise his business and set up closer ties with the contacts he made during his work at the Loggia, including co-workers and other artists in and around Brescia, looking for major commissions. However, his path appeared to lead him increasingly toward sacred art. In 1504, the canon of the Basilica of San Pietro de Dom, Francisco Franzi of Orzinuovi bequeathed the construction of a chapel in the cathedral. Nothing further is known of this commission.|$|E
60|$|This one {{was dark}} {{instead of being}} fair like the other; but he was as big. He was without his coat and waistcoat; he had been doubtless snoozing in the rocking-chair which stood in a corner furthest from the window. Above <b>the</b> great <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{crumpled}} white shirt, buttoned with three diamond studs, his round face looked swarthy. It was moist; his brown moustache hung limp and ragged. He pushed a common, cane-bottomed chair towards me with his foot.|$|R
2500|$|Steadman has {{expressed}} regret at selling the illustrations, at the advice <b>of</b> <b>his</b> agent to Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner for {{the sum of}} $75.

60|$|A gasp of relief, {{followed}} by an angry cry from Valentina, went up when they recognised those that came. First stepped the Count of Aquila in full armour, sword at side and dagger on hip, carrying his head-piece on the crook <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left arm. Behind him towered <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> Fortemani, <b>his</b> great face flushed with a strange excitement, a leather hacketon over his steel cuirass, girt, too, with sword and dagger, and carrying his shining morion in his hand. Last came Lanciotto and Zaccaria, both fully equipped and armed at all points.|$|R
