LoRa technology operating in sub-GHz frequency bands implements these wireless links with minimal power consumption. The employed chirp spread spectrum modulation provides a large link budget, combined with the excellent radio-wave propagation characteristics in these bands. In this paper, an experimental wireless link from a mobile vehicle which transmits sensor data to a base station is measured and analyzed in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and packet loss. These measurements confirm the usefulness of LoRa technology for wireless sensor systems in polar regions. By deploying directional antennas at the base station, a range of up to 30 km is covered in case of Line-of-Sight radio propagation in both the 434 and 868 MHz bands. Varying terrain elevation is shown to be the dominating factor influencing the propagation, sometimes causing the Line-of-Sight path to be obstructed. <b>Tropospheric</b> <b>radio</b> propagation effects were not apparent in the measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{electric}} field {{strength of the}} LF radio broadcasting RMC (Principality of Monaco) which operates at 216 kHz has been recorded since January 1991 by two receivers in central Italy. During the monitoring period we observed two evident attenuations of the field strength in one receiver, with durations of 6 - 10 days. The geomagnetic and ionospheric observations {{carried out in the}} same time interval do not seem able to explain the attenuation of the radio signal. An analysis of the seismic activity occurring in the area between transmitter and receiver has revealed that some days after the attenuations the energy released by earthquakes reaches a maximum. The observed attenuations might therefore be precursors of earthquakes. We also checked meteorological conditions and found that advections of warm air occurred during both the two anomalous periods. It stems possible that these conditions can help the action of preseismic effects in generating irregularities in the vertical gradient of the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>radio</b> refractivity able to produce defocusing of LF radiobroadcast propagation.

Although propagation under anomalous conditions has been modeled, the dependence of accurate refractivity profiling on pressure temperature and moisture means that the validation of models relies on coordinating measurement of these parameters with <b>tropospheric</b> <b>radio</b> link and radar experiments. A height-distributed multi-element transmit-receive 35 GHz CW carrier radio link over 26 km has been built and operated in trials in the Spencer Gulf concurrently with atmospheric refractivity profiling instrumentation that provides a full description of the tropospheric conditions over the air/sea interface.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{satellite}} communication for global coverage has apparently indicated {{a renewed interest}} in the studies of radio wave propagation through the atmosphere, in the VHF, UHF and microwave bands. The extensive measurements of atmosphere constituents, dynamics and radio meterological parameters during the Middle Atmosphere Program (MAP) have opened up further the possibilities of studying <b>tropospheric</b> <b>radio</b> wave propagation parameters, relevant to Earth/space link design. The three basic parameters of significance to radio propagation are thermal emission, absorption and group delay of the atmosphere, all of which are controlled largely by the water vapor content in the atmosphere, particular at microwave bands. As good emitters are also good absorbers, the atmospheric emission as well as the absorption attains a maximum at the frequency of 22. 235 GHz, which is the peak of the water vapor line. The group delay is practically independent of frequency in the VHF, UHF and microwave bands. However, all three parameters exhibit a similar seasonal dependence originating presumably from the seasonal dependence of the water vapor content.

40|$|Abstract: This work, {{investigates the}} diurnal and {{seasonal}} variation of surface refractivity over Jos-plateau state using meteorological parameters on the <b>tropospheric</b> <b>radio</b> refractivity during dry and wet seasons for Jos. Ten months in-situ meteorological {{data obtained from}} National meteorological agency (NMA) Heipang measurement at a station located at Jos south (80 541 O 11 E, 90 551 O 11 N) in Nigeria from August 2012 -May 2013. The data used for the computation of radio refractivity is a five minutes interval of the variations of metrological parameters for each day in the troposphere for Jos. Thirty (30) minutes averages of radio refractivity during dry and wet seasons were calculated from the data obtained. The result indicated that the 30 minutes averages of radio refractivity during wet season are greater than the result in dry season. This is {{as a result of}} variation in meteorological parameters such as relative humidity and temperature which causes the radio refractivity to vary at different time of the day. The variation pattern in Jos is observed because of the altitude (1000 m above sea level). At this altitude the pressure variation seems to be insignificant. The result shows that the surface refractivity generally have higher values during wet season than dry season. The results also show that the diurnal refractivity variation is basically a function of local meteorological parameters (pressure relative humidity, temperature) ...|$|R

Climatological data from 8 upper-air stations and 49 surface stations were used and transformed. into values of refractivity to establish a data base of radio refractivity information. The spatial analysis yielded maps of surface refractivity (Ns) and height corrected surface refractivity (No) for southern Africa. In order to calculate the height correction factors, a radio-climatological classification of southern Africa was drawn: up. These maps are a refinement of the existing maps published by the CSIR. The temporal analysis consisted of graphs of mean monthly and yearly values of various refractivity- (Ns, Delta N, K-factor) and climatological (temperature, vapour pressure) factors for the eight upper-air stations. Some preliminary information about ducting was also obtained from this analysis. A spatial-temporal analysis of limited extent was then performed for one station to obtain {{an indication of the}} factors leading to the formation of <b>radio</b> <b>ducts,</b> as well as the actual variation of refractivity with height.

40|$|We {{recommend}} {{using the}} dayside Martian ionosphere as a reflector for global communication, {{because it has}} a stable density peak and usable critical frequency. This is very crucial for the future Mars ground to ground communication. The dayside ionosphere has been well modeled as a Chapman layer. We suggest performing the Martian nightside ionosphere modeling study. Because the nightside ionosphere has very little measurements available, we propose to drop a digital ionosound instrument into the Mars surface for data collection. Even though the Martian <b>tropospheric</b> <b>radio</b> refractivity had a small value, it still can cause ray bending and multipath effects. We recommend performing an accurate calculation on excess phase and group delays (range and time delays). Other effects, such as range rate errors, appearance angle deviation, defocusing loss on Mars, etc. should be estimated. Ice depolarization effects due to Martian clouds on radio waves are unknown yet, but they are expected to be small, because of lower optical depth and the thinner layer of cloud. Total Martian atmospheric gaseous attenuation is expected to be less than 1 dB on microwaves and, because the Martian atmosphere had very low concentration in uncondensed H 2 O and O 2. An accurate calculation for zenith opacity requires the information about scale heights of H 2 O and O 2 distribution. An accurate water vapor altitude profile at Mars is not available et. Under the normal condition, CO 2 and N 2 gases ddo not have electric or magnetic dipoles and do not absorb electromagnetic energy from the waves. However, they may generate the dipoles through a collision and interact with waves under a high density condition and absorb electromagnetic waves in the infrared and visible band. Dust storm is the most dominant factor on the radio wave attenuation. Large Martian dust storms can cause at least 3 dB or higher loss to Ka band wave. For a normal dust storm, the attenuation is about 1 dB. The attenuation much depends on dust mass loading, dust size distribution, etc. Most large dust storms occur in the southern hemisphere during later spring and early summer when the southern hemisphere becomes suddenly hot...|$|R

With accurate knowledge of the source VLF emissions, the subionospheric component of the received waveform can be effectively removed and the characteristics of the remaining ducted signal accurately estimated. Although the technique has been shown not to produce strictly consistent estimates of the subionospheric and ducted signal amplitudes, it is able to efficiently recover the transit delays and amplitudes of ducted man-made whistler-mode emissions for reasonable values of the relevant signal to noise ratios. This is substantiated by the use of matched filtering to analyze data collected by radio receivers placed at the conjugate ends of a magnetic field line, thereby recovering the amplitudes and transit delays of ducted signals with time-resolution as small as 30 seconds.

40|$|Three {{long-range}} 2 GHz radio paths {{have been}} established in the British Channel Islands in order to investigate the characteristics of long-range propagation of UHF radio waves over the sea {{as part of a}} project supported by Ofcom, UK. The relationship between specific over-sea propagation mechanisms (such as evaporation ducting and super-refraction) in the lower troposphere and signal strength distribution patterns has been examined, modelled and correlated with meteorological parameters. A number of radio meteorological statistics specifically related to evaporation duct propagation in a temperate region such as the English Channel has been presented to confirm the capability of this key propagation mechanism to guide radio waves to distances well beyond the normal <b>radio</b> horizon. Evaporation <b>ducting</b> and diffraction appear to be the dominant propagation mechanisms at most times. Signal strength enhancements have been observed on all three radio paths, primarily in the late afternoon and evening periods, {{in the spring and summer}} months. During periods of enhanced propagation, which occur approximately 8 % of the time of a 50 km path, the presence of additional higher-level ducting/super-refractive structures has been verified and their influence has been modelled with reasonable success. Additionally, the statistical variation of bulk meteorological parameters in the context of enhanced signal propagation has also been examined. The relatively long-term observations made during this study confirm the fact that the constantly changing weather patterns in the troposphere (e. g. the occurrence of anticyclonic weather) are directly responsible for the occurrence of enhanced signals at certain periods of time.
