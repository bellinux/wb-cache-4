25|$|The venom {{from this}} species {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of several drugs. One is called echistatin, which is an anticoagulant. Even though many other snake venoms contain similar toxins, echistatin is not only especially potent, but also simplistic in structure, which makes it easier to replicate. Indeed, it is obtained not only through the purification of whole venom, but also as a product of chemical synthesis. Another drug made from E. carinatus venom is called ecarin and is the primary reagent in the ecarin clotting time (ECT) test, which is used to monitor anticoagulation during treatment with hirudin. Yet another drug produced from E. carinatus venom is Aggrastat (<b>Tirofiban).</b>|$|E

5000|$|In medicine, {{glycoprotein}} IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa, {{also known}} as integrin αIIbβ3) is an integrin complex found on platelets. It is a receptor for fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor and aids platelet activation. The complex is formed via calcium-dependent association of gpIIb and gpIIIa, a required step in normal platelet aggregation and endothelial adherence. Platelet activation by ADP (blocked by clopidogrel) leads to the aforementioned conformational change in platelet gpIIb/IIIa receptors that induces binding to fibrinogen. The gpIIb/IIIa receptor is a target of several drugs including abciximab, eptifibatide, <b>tirofiban.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{activated}} {{partial thromboplastin time}} (aPTT) is [...]the {{most reliable}} coagulation parameter and should be obtained regularly during treatment, particular if a bleeding episode occurs that may be associated with <b>tirofiban</b> therapy.

50|$|Aspirin, an {{antiplatelet}} anticoagulant, {{is given}} as a loading dose {{with the goal}} of reducing the clot size and reduce further clotting in the affected artery. It is known to decrease mortality associated with acute myocardial infarction by at least 50%. P2Y12 inhibitors such as clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor are given concurrently, also as a loading dose, with the dose depending on whether further surgical management or fibrinolysis is planned. Prasugrel and ticagrelor are recommended in European and American guidelines, as they are active more quickly and consistently than clopidogrel. P2Y12 inhibitors are recommended in both NSTEMI and STEMI, including in PCI, with evidence also to suggest improved mortality. Heparins, particularly in the unfractionated form, act at several points in the clotting cascade, help to prevent the enlargement of a clot, and are also given in myocardial infarction, owing to evidence suggesting improved mortality rates. In very high-risk scenarios, inhibitors of the platelet glycoprotein αIIbβ3a receptor such as eptifibatide or <b>tirofiban</b> may be used.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether the 2 <b>tirofiban</b> formulations tested in the early and late phases of the PRISM (Platelet Receptor Inhibitor in Ischemic Syndrome Management) trial might differ with respect to risk for thrombocytopenia and clinical outcomes compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH). BACKGROUND Citrate-buffered <b>tirofiban</b> is currently marketed as brand-name drug. However, <b>tirofiban</b> has recently been promoted in some countries as a generic drug with different formulations, such as phosphate-buffered product.

After a protocol amendment due to a study drug instability report, citrate-buffered <b>tirofiban</b> replaced the phosphate-buffered formulation. Therefore, in the late phase, 737 and 742 patients were treated with citrate-buffered <b>tirofiban</b> and UFH, respectively.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{aimed to}} compare the effects of {{upstream}} <b>tirofiban</b> versus downstream high-dose bolus (HDB) <b>tirofiban</b> and abciximab on tissue level perfusion and troponin I release in high-risk non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BackgroundOptimal timing and dosage of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors for ACS remain to be explored. MethodsWe randomized 93 high-risk ACS patients undergoing PCI to receive upstream (in the coronary care unit) <b>tirofiban,</b> downstream (just prior to PCI) HDB <b>tirofiban,</b> and downstream abciximab. We evaluated {{the effects of the}} three drug regimens on tissue-level perfusion using the corrected Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) frame count, the TIMI myocardial perfusion grade (TMPG), and intracoronary myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) before and immediately after PCI and after cardiac troponin I (cTnI). ResultsThe TMPG 0 / 1 perfusion was significantly less frequent with upstream <b>tirofiban</b> compared with HDB <b>tirofiban</b> and abciximab both before (28. 1 % vs. 66. 7 % vs. 71 %, respectively; p = 0. 0009) and after PCI (6. 2 % vs. 20 % vs. 35. 5 %, respectively; p = 0. 015). Upstream <b>tirofiban</b> was also associated with a significantly higher MCE score index (0. 88 ± 0. 18 vs. 0. 77 ± 0. 32 vs. 0. 71 ± 0. 30, respectively; p < 0. 05). Post-procedural cTnI elevation was significantly less frequent among patients in the upstream <b>tirofiban</b> group compared with the HDB <b>tirofiban</b> and abciximab groups (9. 4 % vs. 30 % vs. 38. 7 %, respectively; p = 0. 018).

40|$|<b>Tirofiban</b> {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of patients with acute coronary syndrome submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We have, previously, shown that <b>tirofiban</b> stimulates VEGF expression and promotes proliferation of endothelial cells. VEGF is a well known inhibitor of endothelial cell apoptosis. TNF-α is a pro-apoptotic cytokine released in the site of a vascular injury, including balloon angioplasty. We thought to investigate whether <b>tirofiban</b> was able to protect endothelial cells from cell death induced by TNF-α. For this study, we used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Analysis of apoptosis was performed by propidium iodide incorporation, annexin V staining and measure of active caspase 3 levels. Western blot served for a semiquantitative measure of Akt activation, VEGF, and the pro-apoptotic Bim and Bak. Our results show that TNF-α was unable to activate caspase 3 and produce cell death in the presence of <b>tirofiban.</b> Activation of apoptosis was preceded by upregulation of Bim and Bak that resulted decreased after addition of <b>tirofiban.</b> The anti-apoptosis effect of <b>tirofiban</b> was reproduced by VEGF and counteracted by VEGFR 2 blockade and the cation chelating agent ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA). The use of p-Akt inhibitor, BEZ 235,and Akt knockdown, suggested that pAkt mediated the prosurvival effect of <b>tirofiban.</b> In conclusion, <b>tirofiban</b> protects endothelial cells from apoptosis stimulated by TNF-α, due to its ability to stimulate VEGF production...|$|E
40|$|Aims To {{perform a}} {{thorough}} and updated systematic review of randomized clinical trials comparing <b>tirofiban</b> vs. placebo or vs. abciximab. Methods and results We searched for randomized trials comparing <b>tirofiban</b> vs. placebo or any active control. Odds ratios (OR) were computed from individual studies and pooled with random-effect methods. Thirty-one studies were identified involving 20 006 patients (12 874 comparing <b>tirofiban</b> vs. heparin plus placebo or bivalirudin alone, and 7132 vs. abciximab). When compared with placebo, <b>tirofiban</b> was associated at 30 {{days with a}} significant reduction in mortality [OR = 0. 68 (0. 54 - 0. 86); P = 0. 001] and death or myocardial infarction (MI) [OR = 0. 69 (0. 58 - 0. 81); P < 0. 001]. The treatment benefit persisted at follow-up but came at an increased risk of minor bleedings [OR = 1. 42 (1. 13, 1. 79), P = 0. 002] or thrombocytopenia. When compared with abciximab, mortality at 30 days did not differ [OR = 0. 90 (0. 53, 1. 54); P = 0. 70], but in the overall group <b>tirofiban</b> trended to increase the composite of death or MI [OR = 1. 18 (0. 96, 1. 45); P = 0. 11]. No such trend persisted at medium-term follow-up or when appraising studies testing <b>tirofiban</b> at 25 mu g/kg bolus regimen.
