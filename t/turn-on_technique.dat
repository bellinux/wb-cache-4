40|$|Abstract:-A novel {{high and}} low speed output buffer circuit is {{proposed}} for Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface applications. Operation principles of this novel buffer are developed based on slew rate control and delayed <b>turn-on</b> <b>technique.</b> The mechanism for slew rate control is process variation self compensating. So, both precise rise and fall times of the output signal have been obtained for low speed operation. Moreover, the pull-up and pull-down output drivers are divided into several sub-drivers in parallel with the delayed turn-on characteristics. Therefore, the change of rate of di/dt decreases. And the simultaneous switching noise, based on simulations, are reduced from maximum overshoot 3. 47 V to 3. 36 V and maximum undershoot from- 0. 427 V to- 0. 068 V, respectively. This proposed output buffer design is low cost due to its easy realization in a digital CMOS process. The disclosed output buffer has been integrated in a complete USB transceiver circuit. Based on measured silicon data, satisfactory functions of the whole USB application IC have been obtained...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — It {{is known}} that if {{harmonic}} spectra are decreased, then acoustic noise also decreased. Hence, this paper deals with a new random switching strategy using DSP TMS 320 F 2812 to decrease the harmonics spectra of single phase switched reluctance motor. The proposed method which combines random <b>turn-on,</b> turn-off angle <b>technique</b> and random pulse width modulation technique is shown. A harmonic spread factor (HSF) is {{used to evaluate the}} random modulation scheme. In order to confirm the effectiveness of the new method, the experimental results show that the harmonic intensity of output voltage for the proposed method is better than that for conventional methods. Keywords—Single phase switched reluctance motor (SRM), harmonic spread factor (HSF), random switching technique. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A novel self-substrate-triggered {{technique}} for on-chip ESD protection design is proposed {{to solve the}} non-uni-form turn-on phenomenon of multi-finger gate-grounded nMOS (GGnMOS). The center-finger nMOS transistors in the multi-finger GGnMOS structure are always turned on first under ESD stress, so its source terminal {{is connected to the}} base (substrate) terminals of the other parasitic lateral n-p-n bipolar transistors (BJTs in the GGnMOS structure) to form the self-substrate-triggered design. With the proposed self-sub-strate-triggered technique, the first turned-on center-finger nMOS transistors are used to trigger on the others. Therefore, all fingers of GGnMOS can be triggered on simultaneously to discharge ESD current. From the experimental results verified in a 0. 13 - m CMOS process with the thin gate oxide of 25 A, the turn-on uniformity and ESD robustness of the GGnMOS can be greatly improved without increasing extra layout area through the pro-posed self-substrate-triggered technique. Index Terms—Electrostatic discharge (ESD), multi-finger gate-grounded nMOS, non-uniform <b>turn-on</b> phenomenon, self-substrate-triggered <b>technique.</b> I...|$|R
