5|$|Faced {{with growing}} losses {{from the late}} 1990s onwards, the {{government}} offered 40percent of Biman to foreign airlines in 2004, hoping a buyer would take over {{the management of the}} carrier. However, the proposal demanded that many decision-making rights remain within the Bangladesh government, and <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> ignored by outside airlines. A similar initiative in 1998 cost Biman $1.6million in consultancy fees with no positive results.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Carrier-Belleuse– now art {{director}} of the Sèvres national porcelain factory– offered Rodin a part-time position as a designer. <b>The</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> in part a gesture of reconciliation, and Rodin accepted. That part of Rodin which appreciated 18th-century tastes was aroused, and he immersed himself in designs for vases and table ornaments that brought the factory renown across Europe.|$|E
5|$|In December 1848 he {{was offered}} a post at the Jagiellonian University in Austrian-ruled Kraków, but <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> soon {{withdrawn}} after pressure from Austrian authorities. In the winter of 1848–49, Polish composer Frédéric Chopin, in the final months of his own life, visited his ailing compatriot and soothed the poet's nerves with his piano music. Over a dozen years earlier, Chopin had set two of Mickiewicz's poems to music (see Polish songs by Frédéric Chopin).|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Offer</b> of Judgment rule is a United States {{tort reform}} law aimed at {{controlling}} unnecessary litigation and at encouraging settlement. Under this rule, if a settlement offer designated as an <b>offer</b> of judgment <b>is</b> made in civil litigation, <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>is</b> rejected and <b>the</b> final court decision is less favorable than <b>the</b> final <b>offer</b> that <b>was</b> made, then the party who rejected <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>is</b> subject to certain penalties. The same principle {{can be found}} in <b>the</b> Calderbank <b>offer</b> jurisprudence in England.|$|R
50|$|An Offer in Compromise {{will have}} no effect upon a tax lien. The lien will remain in effect until <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>is</b> {{accepted}} by <b>the</b> IRS and the full amount of <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> has <b>been</b> paid in full. Once <b>the</b> <b>offered</b> amount has <b>been</b> paid, the taxpayer should request that the IRS remove the lien.|$|R
5|$|In January 1858, Powell {{was elected}} to the United States Senate. In April of that year, President James Buchanan {{appointed}} Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch commissioners to negotiate settlements with the Mormons in Utah. On arriving in Utah, Powell and McCulloch issued a proclamation by President Buchanan offering clemency to Mormons who agreed to submit to Federal authority. <b>The</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> accepted, and violence was averted.|$|E
5|$|In September 1999 Swissair, Delta, and Boeing (who had {{acquired}} McDonnell Douglas through a merger in 1997) agreed to share liability for {{the accident and}} offered {{the families of the}} passengers financial compensation. <b>The</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> rejected in favour of a $19.8billion suit against Swissair and DuPont, the supplier of the Mylar insulation sheathing. A US federal court dismissed the claim in February 2002.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City {{returned}} to the top flight at its first attempt, and in the following years Trautmann established himself {{as one of the}} best keepers in the league, playing in all but five of his club's next 250league matches. By 1952, his fame had spread to his home country, leading Schalke 04 to offer Manchester City £1,000 for his services. <b>The</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> refused; the club responded that they thought Trautmann to be worth twenty times more.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{during the}} 1930s, the {{diplomatic}} climate between Finland and the Soviet Union gradually improved. From the 1920s, the Soviet Union had offered different non-aggression pacts with Finland {{but they were}} all rejected. Now <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> renewed as part of a series of agreements with the countries on the Soviet Union's western border. In 1932, the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Finland, re-affirmed in 1934 for ten years.|$|E
5|$|Sense and Sensibility was {{released}} on a two-disc DVD in the UK on 14 January 2008.

5|$|The Newport Pagnell Canal {{had opened}} in 1817 between the Grand Junction Canal at Great Linford and Newport Pagnell. The canal carried a {{reasonable}} level of traffic, but in 1845, the LNWR attempted {{to buy the}} canal, using it for a potential railway line. <b>The</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> refused for two decades, until 1862, when the LNWR was able to purchase the canal for £9000. The canal closed in 1864. Despite this, the railway when built did not run on {{the line of the}} old canal.|$|E

30|$|In {{terms of}} search theory, this {{reasoning}} means that <b>the</b> same job <b>offer</b> <b>is</b> {{more likely to}} represent an above-average, high-quality offer for unemployed than for employed individuals. Technically speaking, <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>is</b> more likely to correspond to the right tail {{of the distribution of}} wages related to <b>the</b> job <b>offers</b> that <b>the</b> job seekers expect to receive. Thus, <b>the</b> same <b>offer</b> <b>is</b> more likely to exceed their reservation wage and to be accepted by unemployed job searchers.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>offer</b> cannot <b>be</b> {{accepted}} if the offeree {{knows of}} the death of the offeror. In cases where the offeree accepts in ignorance {{of the death}}, the contract may still be valid, although this proposition depends on the nature of <b>the</b> <b>offer.</b> If <b>the</b> contract involves some characteristic personal to <b>the</b> offeror, <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>is</b> destroyed by <b>the</b> death.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{contract with}} ESRO lasted until 1 July 1974, when their low-Earth orbit program terminated. NTNF proposed closing Tromsø Telemetry Station as the remaining customers {{did not provide}} sufficient revenue to keep operations viable. Norway also declined to join the European Space Agency (ESA), which resulted in little hope in ESA choosing to cooperate with a Norwegian earth station. NTNF also looked into outright selling the station to ESA, but <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> turned down. Kongsfjord Telemetry Station was closed in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Władysław {{used the}} title of the King of Sweden, {{although}} he had no control over Sweden whatsoever and never set foot in that country. However, he continued his attempts to regain the Swedish throne, with similar lack of results as his father. He might have been willing to trade his claim away, but <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> never put down in the negotiations.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Lukeville POE at 3 or 3:30 PM, the two agents interviewed Howard and Maureen Cotterman separately. Howard Cotterman {{offered to help}} the agents with the computer, but <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> declined. At 6 PM, the two agents left with both laptops and one digital camera. The devices were taken to Tucson and delivered to John Owens, an ICE Computer Forensic Examiner at 11 PM that night. The camera was returned to the Cottermans as {{there was no evidence}} of contraband found. However, on April 8, Agent Owens' forensic examination turned up approximately 75 images of child pornography on Howard Cotterman's computer. Agent Owens called the Cottermans that night, asking Howard Cotterman for assistance opening the password protected files. Howard Cotterman agreed to come in the next day, but only his wife showed up to pick up the other laptop.|$|E

2500|$|Although an {{invitation}} to treat cannot be accepted, {{it should not be}} ignored, for it may nevertheless affect <b>the</b> <b>offer.</b> [...] For instance, where an <b>offer</b> <b>is</b> made in response to {{an invitation}} to treat, <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> may incorporate <b>the</b> terms of the invitation to treat (unless <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> expressly incorporates different terms). [...] If, as in the Boots [...] case, <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>is</b> made by an action without any negotiations (such as presenting goods to a cashier), <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> will <b>be</b> presumed to be on the terms of the invitation to treat.|$|R
50|$|Also, upon {{making an}} offer, an offeror may include {{the period in}} which <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> will <b>be</b> available. If the offeree fails to accept <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> within this {{specific}} period, then <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> will <b>be</b> deemed as terminated.|$|R
5|$|Although never gaining wide fame, Ali had a {{dedicated}} following on the vaudeville circuit in the United States. He performed for {{heads of state}} including Tsar NicholasII of Russia. Judy Garland named him her favorite vaudevillian and David Blaine identified Ali as his favorite magician. Portions of his act were captured in the short film Strange as It Seems (1930) and in Politiquerias (1931), the Spanish-language version of Laurel and Hardy's Chickens Come Home. Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from Politiquerias: 1977's Gizmo!, and 1999's Vaudeville. Ali's unusual gastric abilities led to rumors that the Rockefeller Institute had offered a large sum of money to obtain his stomach post-mortem. After he died in England, his body was offered to Johns Hopkins University for study, though <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> declined.|$|E
5|$|During a later press investigation, Oosthuizen {{claimed to}} have acted independently. Anton Rupert, the head of Rembrandt, {{endorsed}} this version, asserting that Oosthuizen had acted {{in his capacity as}} an employee of the SASF. Rupert said this was an autonomous organisation, but according to Oborne the SASF constitution made it totally dependent on Rembrandt. Oborne writes that Oosthuizen's offers were rooted in the plans made by Vorster and Coy to bribe D'Oliveira indirectly by offering him work that would prevent him from playing for the MCC. Oborne surmises that the position and salary offered to D'Oliveira did not come from the SASF, but were actually part of a scheme involving Vorster and Rupert to remove the controversial player from the tour. Williams also concludes that <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> effectively a bribe to stop D'Oliveira playing.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau {{remained}} unused in Gotenhafen {{until the}} end of the war. As the Red Army advanced on the city, the remaining crew took the ship out to the entrance of the harbor and sank the vessel as a blockship on 27 March 1945. In 1947, the Polish government ordered the ship be removed, and initial salvage operations began. The ship was sealed and refloated on 12 September 1951 then completely scrapped, though it is believed that some of her steel was used in the construction of Polish merchant vessels. She was the largest ship raised at the time. Norway offered to return the turret from Trondheim in 1979, though <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> rejected. The gun turret was instead preserved as a museum in Norway.|$|E

5|$|Hugh {{took part}} in the Norman {{invasion}} of Ireland and in 1172 was made Lord of Meath; he spent much time away from Ludlow, and HenryII confiscated the castle in his absence, probably to ensure that Hugh stayed loyal while in Ireland. Hugh died in Ireland in 1186 and the castle passed to his son, Walter, who was a minor and did not take charge of the property until 1194. During Prince John's rebellion against Richard I in 1194, Walter joined in the attacks against the prince; Richard did not approve of this and confiscated Ludlow and Walter's other properties. Walter de Lacy offered to buy back his land for 1,000marks, but <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> rejected until in 1198 the vast sum of 3,100marks was finally agreed.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006 Serevi {{was offered}} a {{coaching}} position with the Falcons, a South African side. <b>The</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> several times more than he received from the Fiji Rugby Union. The contract required {{him to be a}} backline coach and player for two years, and then a coach for the next three years. In the end he decided to instead renew his contract with the Fiji Rugby Union. In early 2007 the interim Sports Minister Lekh Ram Vayeshnoi appointed Serevi to the board of the interim Fiji Sports Council.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the {{negotiations}} continued, with Hall prominent. During informal discussions following the 1975 state election, Millhouse {{had been offered}} the deputy leadership in a merged party, and Cameron {{a leading role in}} the upper house, but following the poor showing at the federal election and the deteriorating financial state of the LM, <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>was</b> reduced and the posts that had been offered to Millhouse and Cameron were no longer available. However, Hall was still able to negotiate for the LM President and Treasurer to be given positions on a new executive. He also agreed to forego any further senate bids. An agreement was put in place to protect Boundy from being ousted at a pre-selection of the new party, but this was broken at the next election. The LM was also given an equal voting share on pre-selection committees for three urban lower house seats.|$|E
50|$|Fine {{print is}} {{controversial}} {{because of its}} deceptive nature. Its purpose {{is to make the}} consumer believe that <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>is</b> really great. Though the real truth about <b>the</b> <b>offer</b> <b>is</b> technically available to the consumer in the smaller print of the advertisement—thus virtually ensuring plausible deniability from claims of fraud—it is often designed to be overlooked. The unsuspecting customer, who can instantly see all the attractive aspects of <b>the</b> <b>offer,</b> will, due to natural impulsive behavior, time constraints, and/or personal need, generally not bother to learn the caveats, instead focusing on the positives of the deal.|$|R
