5|$|This section {{covers the}} actual management, or handling, of funds {{pertaining}} {{to a federal}} program, specifically on how federal assistance is distributed to recipients and how recipients manage <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> until disbursement. The actual transfer of funds, {{commonly referred to as}} “drawdowns”, is usually done electronically by requesting <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> to the federal agency via website or a network. <b>The</b> <b>funds</b> are automatically transferred from the US Department of Treasury to the recipient’s bank account. Federal assistance for program operations is provided to recipients usually by one of two methods, also called “funding techniques”: by either advances of funds or by reimbursement of funds.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{destroying}} confiscated ivory, a government {{could choose to}} sell it, and put <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> to use in one of several ways. Several of the countries involved in the ivory trade, especially those {{on the supply side}} in Africa, are also some of the nations which struggle the most with poverty. Destroying ivory in those countries is thus often a controversial decision for internal stakeholders as well as external commentators, as <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> gained by selling the material could be used {{to improve the quality of}} life for human citizens.|$|E
5|$|To raise <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> for {{ships and}} weaponry, Monmouth pawned {{many of his}} belongings. His wife Anne Scott, 1st Duchess of Buccleuch, and her mother also pawned their {{jewellery}} to hire the Dutch warship Helderenberg.|$|E
50|$|The {{management}} fee is paid by <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> to <b>the</b> management company or sponsor that organizes <b>the</b> <b>fund,</b> provides <b>the</b> portfolio management or {{investment advisory services}} and normally lends its brand to <b>the</b> <b>fund.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fund</b> manager may also provide other administrative services. The {{management fee}} often has breakpoints, which means that it declines as assets (in either <b>the</b> specific <b>fund</b> or in <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> family as a whole) increase. <b>The</b> <b>fund's</b> board reviews <b>the</b> management fee annually. Fund shareholders must vote on any proposed increase, but <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> manager or sponsor can agree to waive {{some or all of}} the management fee in order to lower <b>the</b> <b>fund's</b> expense ratio.|$|R
50|$|Open-end and closed-end {{funds are}} overseen by {{a board of}} directors, if {{organized}} as a corporation, or by a board of trustees, if organized as a trust. The Board must ensure that <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> is managed {{in the interests of}} <b>the</b> <b>fund's</b> investors. <b>The</b> board hires <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> manager and other service providers to <b>the</b> <b>fund.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fund</b> sponsors trades (buys and sells) <b>the</b> <b>fund's</b> investments in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>fund's</b> investment objective. Funds that are managed by the same company under the same brand are known as a fund family or fund complex.|$|R
40|$|Term capital-guaranteed {{funds are}} managed {{so that the}} {{investor}} recovers at maturity their initial capital, <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> performance being related {{to the performance of}} financial markets. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate two types of <b>fund</b> management, namely <b>the</b> option method and the cushion method. In the first case, <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> manager statically hedges <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> using options. In the second case, <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> manager dynamically allocates the wealth following specific trading rules to insure <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> will fulfil <b>the</b> guarantee. For both types of management we describe the final value of <b>the</b> <b>fund,</b> we illustrate <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> behaviour for typical market evolutions and we study <b>the</b> distribution of <b>fund</b> values at maturity. Finally, we analyse the risk and performance characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> with various measures and discuss optimality. Our results may help fund managers to choose <b>the</b> adequate <b>fund</b> management method...|$|R
5|$|A {{week after}} taking command, Moosally and his {{executive}} officer, Mike Fahey, canceled a planned $1million repair package for Iowas main gun batteries, including repairs {{to the main}} gun turrets' lighting, electrical, powder hoists, and hydraulic systems—75 detailed deficiencies in all. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> were spent on overhauling the ship's powerplant. In August 1988, Iowa set sail on sea trials around the Chesapeake Bay area and then began refresher training in the waters around Florida and Puerto Rico in October.|$|E
5|$|Along with Charles Madigan, Keogh {{withdrew from}} playing Manchester on 11 March after tour manager James Scott refused to lend them money.

5|$|Chico {{pledged to}} hire 2,000 police {{officers}} {{but did not}} offer specifics on how he would raise <b>the</b> <b>funds.</b> He opposed making the school board an elected body, and he favored extending the school day and school year. Chico picked up endorsements from unions that represented, among others, police officers, firefighters, laborers, painters, operating engineers, iron workers, roofers, and sheet metal workers.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>fund</b> was {{organized}} in March 2001 by USA Mutuals, {{which at the}} time was known as Mutuals.com. <b>The</b> <b>fund's</b> inception date was August 30, 2002. On July 29, 2014, USA Mutuals renamed <b>the</b> Vice <b>Fund</b> to <b>the</b> Barrier <b>Fund</b> to indicate that <b>the</b> <b>fund's</b> core industries have high barriers to entry.

40|$|<b>The</b> International Monetary <b>Fund</b> (IMF), only a {{few years}} ago fading into obscurity in the {{thriving}} world economy, made a comeback during the 2008 - 2009 crisis. The G- 20 re-tasked <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> and tripled its lending capacity. Notwithstanding its new windfall and duties, <b>the</b> <b>Fund’s</b> le-gitimacy and effectiveness are in doubt. The main challenges center on disagreements between the Western European nations and emerging markets over <b>the</b> <b>Fund’s</b> governance and focus, a specter of disintegration of the global crisis management architecture by way of bilateral and regional fi-nancial arrangements (particularly in Asia), and limitations to <b>the</b> <b>Fund’s</b> responsiveness to major crises. Yet the threat of global financial instability persists, and <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> is uniquely qualified to counter it. The United States, <b>the</b> <b>Fund’s</b> founder and main shareholder, has sponsored sound reforms to <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> in <b>the</b> context of the G- 20. However, farther-reaching paradigmatic changes are required for <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> to effectively manage global economic instability in the 21 st century: focusing <b>the</b> <b>Fund’s</b> analytical powers squarely on systemic risks and largest economies rather than on small, developing nations; turning <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> from a crisis firefighter into a global preventive care unit that rewards members for sound policies; and making <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> a bridge between public and private insurance markets...|$|R

5|$|During the 16th century, {{the monastery}} {{frequently}} lost and regained its ownership rights. On <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> of the monastery's new hegumen Afanasiy (a protégé of prince Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski), the monastery's old buildings were demolished, and new ones {{were built in}} their place. In 1604, the Gate Church of Ss. Peter and Paul was constructed, in 1609 - the Mykilska Refectory, and the Transfiguration Cathedral in 1609-1611. Under his rule, the monastery was considered as the second lavra (cave monastery) in Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|Following Walker's death, alumni and {{students}} began {{to raise funds}} to construct a monument {{to him and his}} fifteen years as leader of the university.

40|$|In {{the final}} year of The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund ("the Fund") a project was {{undertaken}} to donate <b>the</b> <b>Fund's</b> files into an accessible archive at the British LIbrary. The archive project was conceived of as a key part of <b>the</b> <b>Fund's</b> legacy; a way of sharing the learning that <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> had acquired over its fifteen years as a grantmaker. Foundations are important stewards of social history and <b>the</b> <b>Fund's</b> Board felt strongly that the learning acquired through the work of <b>the</b> <b>Fund's</b> grantees and partners should be shared for researchers to learn from long after <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> closed. This report has been written by one of the archivists involved in <b>the</b> <b>Fund's</b> archive project. <b>The</b> first section of the report contains a summary of the archive project, explaining how <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> practically went about building an archive and donating it to an archival repository.

5|$|From 1833 to 1834, Jackson {{was engaged}} in {{removing}} federal funds from the Second Bank of the United States during the Bank War.
