500|$|MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan {{wrote that}} the episode [...] "jammed in Regionals, {{something}} that used to matter", and did so without any [...] "meaningful buildup to the competition". Poniewozik described the competition showdown as [...] "unconnected with the episode we began watching", and Canning said that [...] "Regionals just got in the way" [...] and the performances [...] "did a disservice <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> with Karofsky". Votta characterized the McKinley victory as [...] "so secondary {{to the point of}} this episode that it feels completely anticlimactic", and VanDerWerff summarized, [...] "When New Directions hoists that trophy aloft at the end, it’s about the least compelling victory for the group yet." ...|$|E
500|$|The Democrats in the state, calling {{themselves}} [...] "the Conservatives" [...] to differentiate {{themselves from the}} Radical Republicans, were incensed that freedmen – former slaves – had been not only emancipated, but cloaked with the status of citizens, with full civil rights, by the 14th Amendment. [...] Worst of all, {{in the view of}} Conservatives, freedmen were permitted to vote. Even though the Freedmen, whom Conservatives considered inherently inferior, were allowed to vote, former Confederate officers were not. This was especially infuriating since they were expected to pay taxes to fund newly proposed infrastructure changes without any ability to vote against it. They even saw this as an attempt by the Radicals to circumvent the will of God. Violence soon erupted throughout the state. [...] Former Confederate Army officers in nearby Memphis, Tennessee, formed the Ku Klux Klan to fight against the new order. The Klan quickly spread into Arkansas. Republican officials, including Congressmen James Hinds, were attacked, as were black citizens seeking to exercise their new civil rights. [...] Hinds and Brooks were ambushed by gunmen on the road in Monroe County, while traveling to a political event. Brooks was severely wounded and Hinds was killed. Hinds was the first sitting member of congress to ever be murdered, and his murder created national disgust for the ongoing political violence in the South. A Coroner's Inquest identified a local Democratic official and suspected Klan member as the killer. [...] Most contemporaries blamed the Ku Klux Klan, which had threatened to kill Hinds and was actively killing and assaulting other Republicans. [...] Reflecting the times, no-one was ever arrested for the murder. As more violence spread throughout the state, Clayton declared martial law in 14counties. Many Democratic newspapers denied the existence of the secretive Ku Klux Klan while still reporting on the violence. 20th-century research shows the Klan was responsible for most of the violence in the state at this time. A state militia was organized to put down the violence, although it was poorly equipped. With no uniforms and irregular weapons and mounts, the militia was often mistaken for wandering bands of plunderers, sparking a brief but long-remembered [...] "Militia War", and causing terror throughout the state. This was similar <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in North Carolina at the same time now referred to as the Kirk-Holden war.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, Ji was {{promoted}} to mayor of Nanjing, a city with some eight million residents in its areas of jurisdiction. He worked under Party Secretary Yang Weize, with whom {{he was known to}} have a difficult relationship. As mayor of the provincial capital, Ji undertook a large number of massive development projects. In the process, many areas of the city were demolished to make way for new construction. Ji was said to have liked [...] "doing big things", and would put extreme pressure on his subordinates to execute his plans. He once remarked that while Nanjing's construction boom could not be compared to pre-Olympics Beijing, the number of ongoing projects was [...] "comparable <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in Shanghai prior to Expo 2010." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2011, the {{director}} {{announced plans to}} reissue the film which had initially been finalized with the title Black Gold and released in early months of 2011. According to Amata, the film was [...] "out of date": [...] "It {{had to be more}} current. It had to adhere strictly <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> right now – the Arab spring and all that". This change resulted in approximately 60% part of Black Gold being reshot, but still sewn into the original plot of Black Gold. Mickey Rourke, Kim Basinger and Anne Heche who were not part of Black Gold were also added to the cast line-up of Black November. Akon and Wyclef Jean also later joined the set during the last lap of shoot in Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|On September 15, 2008, {{the family}} of a 19-year-old killed in the crash {{announced}} they had filed a claim with Metrolink, generally a precursor to a lawsuit, [...] "alleging the agency chose not to use the available rail safety features," [...] referring to positive train control which they say would have averted the disaster. Eleven days later, an attorney representing the brakeman of the freight train announced a lawsuit against Metrolink, which also named Veolia Transportation and its subsidiary, Connex Railroad, the Metrolink engineer's employer, as defendants. The claim they filed against Metrolink and Veolia was denied, allowing them to proceed with the lawsuit. The lawyer asserted that the Metrolink engineer [...] "was asleep at the switch and not paying attention <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> around him..." [...] and that Metrolink [...] "allowed a dangerous, defective and unsafe condition to exist." ...|$|E

2500|$|During this period, MIT had six {{students}} {{sentenced to prison}} terms, prompting Chomsky to say that MIT's students suffered things that [...] "should not have happened". Despite this, he has described MIT as [...] "the freest and the most honest and has the best relations between faculty and students {{than at any other}} ... quite a good record on civil liberties." [...] Chomsky's differences with student activists at this time led to what he has called [...] "considerable conflict". He described the rebellions across US campuses as [...] "largely misguided" [...] and he was unimpressed by the student uprising of May 1968 in Paris, saying, [...] "I paid virtually no attention <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in Paris as you can see from what I wrote - rightly, I think." [...] On the other hand, Chomsky was also very grateful to the students for raising the issue of the war in Vietnam.|$|E
2500|$|In 1983 Dahl {{reviewed}} Tony Clifton's God Cried, {{a picture}} {{book about the}} siege of West Beirut by the Israeli army during the 1982 Lebanon War. Dahl's review stated that the book would make readers [...] "violently anti-Israeli", writing, [...] "I am not anti-Semitic. I am anti-Israel." [...] Dahl told a reporter in 1983, [...] "There's a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity ... I mean {{there is always a}} reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn't just pick on them for no reason." [...] Dahl maintained friendships with a number of Jews, including philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, who said, [...] "I thought he might say anything. Could have been pro-Arab or pro-Jew. There was no consistent line. He was a man who followed whims, which meant he would blow up in one direction, so to speak." [...] Amelia Foster, director of the Roald Dahl Museum in Great Missenden, states, [...] "This is again an example of how Dahl refused to take anything seriously, even himself. He was very angry at the Israelis. He had a childish reaction <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in Israel. Dahl wanted to provoke, as he always provoked at dinner. His publisher was a Jew, his agent was a Jew... and he thought nothing but good things of them. He asked me to be his managing director, and I'm Jewish." ...|$|E
