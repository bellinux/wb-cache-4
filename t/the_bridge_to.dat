5|$|In early 1973, the Architectural Review {{submitted}} {{a proposal to}} convert the Albert Bridge into a landscaped public park and pedestrian footpath across the river. The proposal proved very popular with the area's residents, and a May 1973 campaign led by John Betjeman, Sybil Thorndike and Laurie Lee raised a petition of 2,000signatures for <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> be permanently closed to traffic. Although the GLC reopened <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> traffic in July 1973, it also announced its intention {{to proceed with the}} Architectural Review scheme once legal matters had been dealt with.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the alternative education model, <b>the</b> <b>Bridges</b> <b>to</b> Success Program, and the program’s impact on teachers teaching within the program in a middle school in the Upstate of South Carolina. <b>The</b> <b>Bridges</b> <b>to</b> Success Program was initiated in September 2009 for at-risk students in eighth grade with a history of poor attendance, behavior issues, and low math and reading academic performance. The evaluation model used was the Logic Model. The research questions set the framework for this study. Research questions focused on short-term outcomes that evaluated how teacher knowledge of at-risk students changed as well as how their knowledge of their own teaching skills and instructional strategies changed from teaching within <b>the</b> <b>Bridges</b> <b>to</b> Success Program. Another research question focused on intermediate outcomes that would demonstrate if teacher behavior and attitudes had changed as a result of the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Bridges</b> <b>to</b> Success Program. <b>The</b> final research question focused on the long-term outcomes that revealed the impact of <b>the</b> <b>Bridges</b> <b>to</b> Success Program on the culture of the eighth grade. The researcher used surveys and focus group interviews with the staff to answer the research questions. Participants for this study included <b>Bridges</b> <b>to</b> Success Program teachers and eighth-grade teachers within the school of the study. The data methods were studied individually for trends as well as combined for themes across all data methods. The data were shared in frequency distribution tables. Each of the outcomes was addressed, and evidence from the study was provided as to the impact to the teachers in this study. The study revealed the impact of <b>the</b> <b>Bridges</b> <b>to</b> Success Program on the teachers within <b>the</b> <b>Bridges</b> <b>to</b> Success Program. An analysis of the data showed that <b>the</b> <b>Bridges</b> <b>to</b> Success Program had a positive impact on teacher knowledge, behaviors, attitude, and overall culture in the eighth grade of the school in the study. Themes that contributed to the positive impact were caring teachers who set high expectations, engaging parents, developing self-efficacy in students, incorporating professional development, and single-gender education...|$|R
5|$|The {{opening in}} 1885 of the Saint-Louis–Dakar railway {{increased}} the traffic over the bridge. The railway reached {{all the way}} to Sor and all the goods hauled between the coast and the railway station had to cross over <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> <b>To</b> prevent the breakdown of the bridge a special decree was given so that the maximum weight for a vehicle that crosses <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> be less than one and a half tonnes. With all its difficulties the bridge remained in service 32 years, until 1897 when it was dismantled.|$|E
5|$|A local landmark, the Fremont Troll—a large cement {{sculpture}} of a troll clutching a real-life Volkswagen Beetle—was installed under the bridge's north end in 1990. Up to half of the $40,000 cost for the artwork was donated from Seattle's Neighborhood Matching Fund, a local program {{to raise money for}} community projects. The sculpture was heavily vandalized in the year following its construction and large floodlights were installed on <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> discourage further damage.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the steering {{from the bridge}} was disabled. Blücher had just passed Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak shallows) and was in a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. Normally the rudder is controlled electrically from <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> the motors forward of the Handsteuerraum (hand steering room) deep under the armored deck, forward of the rudder. In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual steering, but orders from <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> the rudder may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. The speed of the torpedo was known and set, but {{the speed of the}} target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to preparing strong fortified {{positions on the}} high ground in Girard {{on the west side}} of the Chattahoochee River, Cobb ordered the base of <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> <b>to</b> be wrapped in cotton and doused with turpentine in the event that the Confederates were unable to fend off Wilson's raiders from <b>the</b> <b>bridges.</b> This would allow the Confederates, as a last resort, <b>to</b> burn <b>the</b> <b>bridges</b> <b>to</b> deny Wilson's troops easy access to Columbus.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{proportion}} {{of patients who}} can be bridged with left ventricular assist devices to myocardial recovery and the long-term outcome of these patients is unknown. MethodsWe investigated the outcomes of patients <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> recovery compared with those <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> transplantation. All left ventricular assist devices were implanted as a <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> transplantation with a very proactive program of promoting myocardial recovery. A total of 40 patients were <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> recovery and 52 <b>to</b> transplantation. Of <b>the</b> <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> recovery (explanted) group, 33 were men (age, 32. 8 ± 11. 8 years), 37 had dilated cardiomyopathy (familial in 3, peripartum cardiomyopathy in 3) and 3 had myocarditis. Of <b>the</b> <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> transplantation (transplanted) group, 42 were men (age, 42. 3 ± 12. 5 years; P < . 0005 vs <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> recovery). <b>The</b> diagnosis was ischemic heart disease in 24, dilated cardiomyopathy in 21 (only 13 received drug therapy), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy in 2, arrythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia in 2, myocarditis in 1, and congestive heart disease in 2. ResultsThe survival rate was 89. 9 %, 73. 9 %, and 73. 9 % and 80. 4 %, 78. 3, and 78. 3 % in the explanted and transplanted groups at 1, 5, and 7 years, respectively. In total, 12 (23 %) patients bridged transplantation either died from, or required ventricular assist device support, for primary graft failure. Of the explanted patients, 4 (10 %) subsequently required transplantation at 34, 512, 1019, and 1213 days (2 died 25 and 1867 days after transplantation and 2 were well after 1523 and 3199 days). The rate of transplant or ventricular assist device-free survival less noncardiac death for <b>the</b> <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> recovery and <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> transplantation groups, respectively, was 89. 9 %, 73. 9 %, and 73. 9 % and 80. 4 %, 78. 3 %, and 78. 3 % at 1, 3, and 7 years. At latest follow-up (1394 ± 1195 days for <b>the</b> <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> recovery and 1913 ± 941 days for <b>the</b> <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> transplantation group), 5 of <b>the</b> <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> transplantation patients (9. 6 %) had malignancy, 34 (65. 4 %) had hypercholesterolemia, 25 (48. 1 %) had hypertension, and 7 (13. 5 %) had coronary disease. The creatinine was 125. 5 ± 43. 5 vs 95. 2 ± 16. 5 μmol/L for <b>the</b> <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> transplantation and <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> recovery groups (P < . 001). ConclusionsThe outcome after explantation for myocardial recovery is comparable, if not better than, after <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> transplantation...|$|R
