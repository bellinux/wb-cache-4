5|$|A {{key feature}} of the Cadet Nurse Corps program was its {{accelerated}} training curricula. Participating schools of nursing were required to compress the traditional nursing program of 36 months to 30 months. They were also bound to provide the students with the four clinical experiences of medical, surgical, obstetrics, and pediatrics. The students became senior cadets in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> before graduation, requiring them to serve in a federal or civilian hospital. They rendered full-time service equivalent {{to that of a}} graduate nurse. During their first nine months of service, the cadets were protected by regulation from working on the wards for more than 24 hours each week. Junior cadets typically worked between 40 and 48 hours each week, including classes. Senior cadets were free of classes. All State Boards of Nursing modified their regulations to agree with the accelerated program.|$|E
40|$|Survey {{data from}} 295 {{employees}} {{were used for}} testing two hypotheses: (1) Procedural injustice at work has negative effects on psychosomatic well-being. (2) The impact of procedural injustice depends on the person´s justice sensitivity. Justice sensitivity as well as desired and perceived procedural fairness according to Leventhal´s criteria (consistency, nonpartiality, accuracy, correctability, representativeness) were measured via questionnaire. Job satisfaction, number of sick days during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>month,</b> and number of days a person felt sick at work during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> served as indicators of psychosomatic well-being. The difference between desired and perceived procedural fairness (ought-is discrepancy) {{was used as a}} measure of procedural unfairness. Psychosomatic well-being was predicted from the ought-is discrepancy with justice sensitivity serving as a moderator. Hypotheses were tested via moderated regression analyses. In line with the first hypothesis, procedural unfairness had a negative effect on psychosomatic well-being. In partial support of the second hypothesis, justice sensitivity moderated this effect on two measures of psychosomatic well-being...|$|R

5|$|From August 1940 to June 1941, the German Luftwaffe (air force) unit III./KG 40, {{which was}} based at Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport in {{southern}} France and equipped with Focke-Wulf Fw200 Condors, attacked Allied shipping travelling in the Atlantic. The unit {{made a number of}} successful attacks on convoys and individual ships traveling in the Western Approaches {{as well as on the}} route between Britain and Gibraltar. In response, the Allies increased the anti-aircraft armament carried by many merchant ships, and began to deploy CAM ships and escort carriers to provide fighter protection for convoys. During <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of 1941 these improved defences inflicted heavy losses on the Condor force, and it ceased attacking shipping in early 1942. In 1942, III./KG40 mainly operated in the reconnaissance role and reported targets for U-boats to attack. A small number of attacks were made on ships travelling between Britain and Gibraltar from May onwards, but these cost the unit eight Condors destroyed in action and seven in accidents for no sinkings. As a result of the Condor's vulnerability to Allied defences, the commander of the Luftwaffe's Atlantic anti-shipping force (Fliegerführer Atlantik) recommended in December that the aircraft be withdrawn from service.|$|E
5|$|The low {{casualties}} the Commonwealth {{air forces}} incurred during the Battle of Normandy {{led to an}} over-supply of trained aircrew. While the number of pilots and other airmen undergoing training through the EATS had begun to be reduced in early 1944, by 30 June {{there were thousands of}} qualified airmen—including 3,000 Australians—in the UK waiting for posts in operational units. This number greatly exceeded the requirements of the Allied air forces. Accordingly, the flow of airmen from EATS training facilities in Canada to the UK was greatly cut back, and Australia ceased sending airmen overseas for training under the scheme in August. While 1,245 Australian airmen arrived in the UK during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of 1944 (a reduction from the 5,181 who had arrived {{in the first six months}} of the year), only those who were qualified as air gunners were typically ever assigned to combat units. It was not possible to find flying positions for most of the remaining unattached airmen who arrived after June 1944, and some were posted back to Australia; the remainder spent the rest of the war in training courses and various non-flying roles.|$|E

40|$|As {{a part of}} the HIV {{behavioural}} {{surveillance system}} in Switzerland, repeated cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 1993, 1994, 1996, 2000 and 2006 among attenders of all low threshold facilities (LTFs) with needle exchange programmes and/or supervised drug consumption rooms for injection or inhalation in Switzerland. Data were collected in each LTF over five consecutive days, using a questionnaire that was partly completed by an interviewer and partly self administered. The questionnaire was structured around three topics: socio-demographic characteristics, drug consumption, health and risk/preventive behaviour. Analysis was restricted to attenders who had injected drugs during their lifetime (IDUs). Between 1993 and 2006, the median age of IDUs rose by 10 years.
