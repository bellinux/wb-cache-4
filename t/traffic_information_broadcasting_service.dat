40|$|Intelligent Truck Parking (ITP) {{involves}} {{efficient management}} of information {{as a tool}} for addressing some of the problems related to truck parking, such as, the inability to navigate to, or reserve a parking space. Different telematic services (ITP core services) may be required to address different stakeholder needs, e. g., a navigation service for finding the way to a truck parking area, and a reservation service for assuring the availability of a parking space when in the parking area. In addition to ITP core services, there are several other telematic services that address transport problems in general. If the synergies of different services are taken into account during design and deployment of telematic services, cost reduction may be achieved through functionality sharing. In this article, we have identified services that are relevant for sharing functionalities with ITP core services, estimate functionality costs and perform a synergy analysis to assess the marginal cost savings as a result. Overall results indicates that <b>Traffic</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> (TIB), Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for goods, and Geo-fencing (GEO) can form clusters with ITP core services that could lead to better cost savings compared {{to the rest of the}} services studied.

40|$|Abstract:Shortest path {{computation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common queries in location-based services that involve transportation networks. Motivated by scalability challenges faced in the mobile network industry, we propose adopting the wireless broadcast model for such location-dependent applications. Existing work develop a framework called live traffic index (LTI) which enables drivers to quickly and effectively collect the live <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> on the <b>broadcasting</b> channel. An impressive result is that the driver can compute/update their shortest path result by receiving only a small fraction of the index. As such, huge communication cost will be spent on sending result paths on this model. We will extend our solution on time dependent networks. This is a very interesting topic since the decision of a shortest path depends not only on current traffic data bu...|$|R
40|$|At its {{invention}} {{radio was}} not taken seriously and many governments {{were reluctant to}} finance its development. However the scenario changed when the potential of radio was realised and governments began to regulate it. Zimbabwe does not comply with the African Charter on Broadcasting as {{it does not have}} Community radio. The study analyses the Act and carries out institutional analysis of CRIs. The study established that community radio initiatives in Zimbabwe are not licenced but are registered with the Ministry of Media, <b>Information</b> and <b>Broadcasting</b> <b>Services.</b> The country has over twenty CRIs and these are based in both urban and rural areas and their funding mainly comes from donors while most personnel at the stations are volunteers. The most vibrant of these CRIs operate in the capital city Harare and Bulawayo. Lack of licencing resulted in them broadcasting through the internet, messages over mobile phones as well as recording, distribution and playing radio programmes using compact discs. Since this is not real transmission some audiences do not get immediate information as in â€˜realâ€™ radio. There is need for the government to licence community broadcasters so that Zimbabweans have access to alternative radio...|$|R
