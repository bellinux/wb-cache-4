At −1.1, Aldebaran was brightest before this period, and it and Capella were situated rather close to each other in <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> served as boreal pole stars at the time.|$|E
5|$|Barbree {{grew up on}} his family's farm in Early County, Georgia, {{and entered}} the United States Air Force in 1950, {{when he was only}} 16 years of age.

5|$|Bart wanders onto a U.S. Army {{base and}} manages to hijack a tank. He cuts {{a swath of}} {{destruction}} through the town and eventually stops at the school. There, he points the tank's cannon into <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> shoots down a Major League Baseball satellite; inside are detailed documents on everybody's behaviors. Mark McGwire appears, distracts the citizens with a long home run, and hides the evidence under his cap. Marge takes Bart off Focusyn for good and puts him back on Ritalin. Major League Baseball, however, still spies on the Simpson family due to an autographed bat McGwire gave Bart that has a hidden camera.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are monogamous {{and usually}} bond for life, though new pairings may follow a {{fatality}} of one individual. A feature of a bonded couple is the synchronous calling which the female usually initiates. She stands with her wings folded and beak pointed to <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> emits {{a series of}} trumpeting calls. The male stands alongside in a similar posture but with his wings flared and primaries drooping. He emits one longer call for every two emitted by the female.|$|E

Clark has also highlighted a performance by American garage rock band Thee Oh Sees in the games room and The Cribs' December 2007 shows as being particularly memorable.|$|E
5|$|In the Brahmanda Purana, Kamadhenu {{creates a}} great city by her power to {{accommodate}} Kartavirya Arjuna's army, when they visit Jamadagni's hermitage. On returning to his kingdom, Kartavirya Arjuna's minister, Chandragupta, persuades him to capture the divine cow. The minister returns to the hermitage and tries to convince the sage to give away the cow, but to no avail, so he tries to snatch Kamadhenu with force. In the ensuing fight, the sage is killed, but Kamadhenu escapes to <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> Chandragupta takes her calf with him instead. The Brahmanda Purana narrates this Kamadhenu Sushila was given to Jamadagni by the Kamadhenu-Surabhi, who governs in Goloka.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{received}} an informal education in Latin, geometry and mathematics. In later life, Leonardo recorded only two childhood incidents. One, which he {{regarded as an}} omen, was when a kite dropped from <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> hovered over his cradle, its tail feathers brushing his face. The second occurred while he was exploring in the mountains: he discovered a cave and was both terrified that some great monster might lurk there and driven by curiosity {{to find out what}} was inside.|$|E

5|$|Messier 87 (also {{known as}} Virgo A or NGC 4486, and {{generally}} abbreviated to M87) is a supergiant elliptical galaxy {{in the constellation}} Virgo. One of the most massive galaxies in the local universe, it is notable for its large population of globular clusters—M87 contains about 12,000 compared to the 150–200 orbiting the Milky Way—and its jet of energetic plasma that originates at the core and extends outward at least 1,500 parsecs (4,900 light-years), travelling at relativistic speed. It {{is one of the}} brightest radio sources in <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> is a popular target for both amateur astronomy observations and professional astronomy study.|$|E
5|$|Skaði also {{included}} in her terms of settlement that the gods must do something she thought {{impossible for them to}} do: make her laugh. To do so, Loki tied one end of a cord around the beard of a nanny goat and the other end around his testicles. The goat and Loki drew one another back and forth, both squealing loudly. Loki dropped into Skaði's lap, and Skaði laughed, completing this part of her atonement. Finally, in compensation to Skaði, Odin took Þjazi's eyes, plunged them into <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> from the eyes made two stars.|$|E
5|$|The Comet {{appears in}} <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> Azula's {{coronation}} takes place. Azula banishes {{nearly all of}} her subjects, haunted by the betrayals of former friends Mai and Ty Lee. Her paranoia and loneliness begin to drive her insane. Before she is crowned, Zuko and Katara arrive. Zuko accepts Azula's challenge to a one-on-one duel because he realizes Azula is distracted {{and he does not}} want Katara injured. Just as Zuko {{is on the verge of}} defeating Azula, she shoots a bolt of lightning at an unprepared Katara. Zuko throws himself in front of her and intercepts the lightning, preventing Katara from getting hurt, but gravely injuring himself.|$|E

5|$|The Incas {{arranged}} their empire {{to demonstrate}} their cosmology. The capital, Cusco, was at {{the centre of the}} empire and connected to it by means of ceques, conceptually straight lines radiating out from the centre. These ceques connected the centre of the empire to the four suyus, which were regions defined by their direction from Cusco. The notion of a quartered cosmos is common across the Andes. Gary Urton, who has conducted fieldwork in the Andean villagers of Misminay, has connected this quartering with the appearance of the Milky Way in the night sky. In one season it will bisect <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> in another bisect it in a perpendicular fashion.|$|E
5|$|The series {{takes place}} over the span of six books, which are: The Quest Begins, Great Bear Lake, Smoke Mountain, The Last Wilderness, Fire in <b>the</b> <b>Sky,</b> <b>and</b> Spirits in the Stars. The story follows four young bears. Lusa, a black bear, Kallik, a polar bear, Toklo, a grizzly bear and Ujurak, {{who is able to}} shape-shift into any animal, but remains a brown bear most of the time.|$|E
5|$|The spongy {{bones of}} the woodpecker's skull and the {{flexibility}} of its beak, both of which provide protection for the brain when drumming, have provided inspiration to engineers; a black box needs to survive intact when a plane falls from <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> modelling the black box with regard to a woodpecker's anatomy has increased the resistance of this device to damage sixty-fold. The design of protective helmets is another field being influenced by the study of woodpeckers.|$|E

5|$|The {{third and}} best-understood mansio {{was built on}} a stone base about 130CE. It was at least two storeys high and fronted by a {{colonnade}} with a tiled roof, probably supported on wooden columns. In {{the centre of the}} colonnade, a large door formed the main entrance to the interior of the building. Through the entrance hall was a colonnaded atrium or courtyard with a plastered floor, the central area probably being open to <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> perhaps containing a herbaceous garden. Timber posts resting on these foundations {{around the edges of the}} colonnade supported a balcony above.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Madonna walking {{at night in}} the middle of the street of an American city {{surrounded}} by skyscrapers and wind. Then she finds herself in another dimension, as moving flowers surround her. As the video advances, Madonna walks on other different kinds of roads. She walks on a path of red flowers in <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> then walks on her knees on a deep, blue colored sea, as she is followed by little white fairies. At the end of the video, when there is destruction in the real dimension, Madonna finds peace and is surrounded by the fairies. When they go away, Madonna disappears altogether.|$|E
5|$|Tucana {{is not a}} {{prominent}} constellation as all of its stars are third magnitude or fainter; the brightest is Alpha Tucanae with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.87.
