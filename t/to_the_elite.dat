5000|$|When Khosrow I {{ascended the}} Sasanian throne in 531, {{he began a}} series of reforms that was started by his father and {{predecessor}} Kavadh I.

Khosrow was quite successful in these reforms, and after his death in 579, he was succeeded by his son Hormizd IV, who continued his father's policies, but in a harsher way; in order <b>to</b> control <b>the</b> <b>elites,</b> he, in <b>the</b> words of Shapur Shahbazi, [...] "resorted to harshness, denigration, and execution." [...] Hormizd was extremely hostile <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elites</b> and did not trust them; therefore, he constantly sided with the lower classes.|$|R

5|$|An {{indication}} of the army's high esteem for barbarian-born troops is that {{they appear to have}} been preferentially recruited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elite</b> units of the late imperial era's armies. In the auxilia palatina infantry regiments, the proportion of barbarians in the ranks appears to have numbered anywhere between a third and a half of effectives (compared to a quarter in the army as a whole). From the late 3rd century onwards, barbarian recruitment became crucial to the army's continued existence, by providing a much-needed source of first-rate recruits.|$|E
5|$|Bo was {{considered}} a likely candidate for promotion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elite</b> Politburo Standing Committee in 18th Party Congress in 2012.

40|$|We {{consider}} a resource-dependent economy initially ruled by <b>the</b> <b>elite.</b> <b>The</b> transition from <b>the</b> autocratic <b>to</b> {{a more democratic}} regime takes place only if <b>the</b> citizens decide <b>to</b> revolt against <b>the</b> <b>elite.</b> <b>The</b> occurrence of a revolution primarily depends on the autocratic regime vulnerability {{and the level of}} inequalities, both being driven by <b>the</b> <b>elite's</b> redis- tribution and repression policies. First, we show that when a political transition is inevitable, <b>the</b> <b>elite</b> choose <b>the</b> maximum rate of redistribution to lengthen their period in office. Second, we find that the duration of the autocratic regime is linked to resource abundance, and how it relates <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elite's</b> policies. More resources lead to a shorter reign of a redistributive regime, which may not be the case of a repressive regime. Finally, we interpret the Arab spring sequence in light of our findings...|$|R

5|$|Rabearivelo's {{early period}} of modernist-inspired poetry showed skill and {{attracted}} critical attention but adhered strictly to traditional genre conventions. The surrealist poetry he composed beginning in 1931 displayed greater originality, garnering him strong praise and acclaim.

He suffered {{a series of}} personal and professional disappointments, including {{the death of his}} daughter, the French authorities' decision to exclude him from the list of exhibitors at the Universal Exposition in Paris, and growing debt worsened by his philandering and opium addiction. Following Rabearivelo's suicide by cyanide poisoning in 1937, he became viewed as a colonial martyr.|$|E
