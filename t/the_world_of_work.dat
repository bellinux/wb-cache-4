Ten key ingredients of labour policy appropriate to <b>the</b> new <b>world</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> are then outlined and illustrated with specific policy examples. The paper concludes with a checklist of questions to ask with respect to policy initiatives in <b>the</b> new <b>world</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> {{as well as a}} list of research needs to guide policy formation in this area.

It is necessary to create and nurture an environment of innovation. Executives and managers need to break away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage. It is a time of risk but even greater opportunity. <b>The</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is changing with the increase in the use of technology and both companies and businesses are becoming increasingly competitive. Companies will have to downsize and re-engineer their operations to remain competitive. This will affect employment as businesses will be forced {{to reduce the number of}} people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more.|$|E

This {{study found that the}} most effective programs for young people provide sustained adult contact. [...] Results indicate that the most effective strategies for keeping young people in school are those that build bridges to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> while young people are still in school. The most effective strategies were found to combine a training component with strong links to the employer community, more formal training linked to on-the-job training and work experience, and job search assistance and transitional wage subsidies (HRDC June 1997). [...] There is some evidence that co-operative education programs lead to improved employment outcomes in post-secondary school although the number of work experience placements offered by employers is quite limited.|$|E

But then Gerald must always come away from Birkin, as from a Church service, back to the outside real world of work and life. There it was, it did not alter, and words were futilities. He had to keep himself in reckoning with <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and material life.

40|$|Every {{culture has}} its own {{conception}} of poetry and approaches it differently. This paper draws on phenomenological approach, in specific that of Mikel Dufrenne, to compare it with Structuralism’s approach. Dufrenne makes use of two Husserlian concepts, noema and noesis, to show {{the difference between these}} two approaches to poetry. He contends that Structuralist commentaries does not provide much in terms of enjoying and understanding poetry because it says almost nothing to get us in close touch with the lived experience <b>of</b> poet and <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> his <b>work.</b> Phenomenological approach, on the contrary, moves from noema toward noesis and as such gives a way to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> and yields an aesthetic understanding of it. Dufrenne sees <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> not as represented but instead as a world that {{can be traced back to}} poet’s lived experience to which Structuralist rules grant no access.
