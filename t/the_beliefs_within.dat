In addition, publishing one additional refereed article in the US or Europe increases the probability that an academic has worked in exactly two universities by 1 %.

What {{implications}} {{are there for}} SDI evaluation research when {{the focus is on}} ‘geoICT in use ’ in public governance rather than on the potential of geoICT to provide solutions to general geoinformation processing problems? To explore this question, we first contrast <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>within</b> the geographic community regarding the potential of geoICT to improve governance and the empirical evidence of actual geoICT use in governance. The cleavage between the two prompts us to explore the challenges perceived by the much broader public administration research community, who are concerned with implications of ICT implementation in the public sector. To this end, we find that research focused on geoICT use in public governance is tantamount to empirically and theoretically sound SDI evaluation, from a governance perspective. In order to give directions for SDI evaluation research, we articulate research questions pertinent to the actual use of geoICT in governance. We suggest that exploratory evaluation and an interpretive research approach may be more suitable to tackle the research questions that arise from a governance perspective in SDI evaluation rather than design oriented research originating from GI Science...|$|E

This article points to a novel link between silence and charismatic authority by examining the new religious movement (NRM) led by John de Ruiter and showing the important role that interpersonal silence plays in {{the social construction of}} his superhuman status.

Firstly, the projection-eliciting aspect, of interpersonal silence fosters <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>within</b> devotees that de Ruiter has the ability to speak to the specific personal needs of people whom he has never met.

The analysis was conducted using the design process of an electric shaver.

With regard to this case study, it emerged that an explicit focus on the underlying architecture of the shaver increased the practical and theoretical understanding of system-level coordination. Moreover, the analysis resulted in a significant number of structured options for improvement. These included improved ways of achieving coordination for the given product architecture and options to adapt the product architecture so that coordination is facilitated. Some of these options have been implemented within new design processes for shavers, and it should be possible to measure their impact on project performance in the future. ...|$|R

Indeed, ethnographic studies of multilingual practices in research contest such essentialist assumptions (Le Page and Tabouret-Keller, [1985]; Rampton, [1995]). Such studies on highly multilingual/multicultural communities around the world, e.g. India (Pattanayak, [1990]), Africa (Heugh and Pluddeman, [1995]), Pacific (Mühlhäsler, [1996]), and Central America (Freeland, [2003]), have demonstrated the inadequacy of relying on essentialist assumptions about communities for language policy and planning in complex multilingual societies where people have fluid multilingual identities.
