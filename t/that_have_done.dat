Some hurricanes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> significant damage in the state are the 1938 New England hurricane, Hurricane Carol (1954), Hurricane Donna (1960), and Hurricane Bob (1991).|$|E
25|$|Rhode Island has {{abolished}} capital punishment, {{making it}} one of 19 states <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so. Rhode Island abolished the death penalty very early, just after Michigan, the first state to abolish it, and carried out its last execution in the 1840s. Rhode Island was the second to last state to make prostitution illegal. Until November 2009 Rhode Island law made prostitution legal provided it took place indoors. In a 2009 study Rhode Island was listed as the 9th safest state in the country.|$|E
500|$|At best, Hydrophiinae make {{difficult}} captives. Ditmars (1933) {{described them}} as nervous and delicate captives that usually refuse to eat, preferring only {{to hide in}} the darkest corner of the tank. Over 50years later, Mehrtens (1987) wrote, although they were rarely displayed in Western zoological parks, some species were regularly on display in Japanese aquariums. Available food supply limits the number of species that can be kept in captivity, since some have diets that are too specialized. Also, some species appear intolerant of handling, or even being removed from the water. [...] Regarding their requirements in captivity, the Laticauda species {{need to be able to}} exit the water somewhere [...] at about 29°C, along with a submerged shelter. Species <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> relatively well in captivity include the ringed sea snake, Hydrophis cyanocinctus, which feeds on fish and eels in particular. Pelamis platurus has done especially well in captivity, accepting small fish, including goldfish. However, care has to be taken to house them in round or oval tanks, or in rectangular tanks with corners that are well-rounded, to prevent the snakes from damaging their snouts by swimming into the sides.|$|E

500|$|Marvel Studios {{developed}} specific {{business practices}} to create its shared universe, including choosing filmmakers that were considered [...] "out-of-left-field", given their previous work. Feige remarked, [...] "You don't {{have to have}} directed a big, giant visual-effects movie to do a big, giant visual-effects movie for us. You just have to have done something singularly sort of awesome," [...] adding [...] "It's worked out well for us when we've taken people [...] <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> very, very good things. Very rarely are one of those good things a big giant blockbuster superhero movie." [...] When hiring directors, the studio usually has [...] "a kernel of {{an idea of what}} we want", which is presented to potential directors {{over the course of several}} meetings to discuss and further expand. [...] "And if over the course of three or four or five meetings they make it way better than what we initially were spewing to them, they usually get the job", according to Feige. Later expanding on this process, Feige explained that before talking to any directors on a film, Marvel Studios often puts together a [...] "lookbook" [...] of influences from the comics and art by Marvel's visual development department, to create a visual template for the film. These are put together at company retreats, which the studio holds every [...] "18 months or so" [...] to plan out and develop the phases of the MCU. These lookbooks are not always shown to directors, though, with Marvel sometimes preferring to let the director offer their own ideas first.|$|E

2500|$|Around 1993, Massachusetts Institute of Technology {{linguistics}} {{professor and}} political commentator Noam Chomsky praised the film {{because of the}} way people were portrayed doing the real work of unions.

2500|$|The first whale {{watching}} in Japan {{was conducted in}} the Bonin Islands in 1998 by a group called Geisharen (...) , which was formed by groups of domestic and international people including both domestic and international celebrities and notable cetacean researchers and conservationists such as Roger Payne, Erich Hoyt, Richard Oliver, Jim Darling, John Ford, Kyusoku Iwamoto (cartoonist), Hutoushiki Ueki (science writer), Nobuyuki Miyazaki (head chief of the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute of The University of Tokyo), Nobuaki Mochizuki (one of the world's first whale photographers to record a living North Pacific right whale underwater in 1990 in Bonin Islands), Junko Sakuma (freelancer), and so on. During this time until before the group reach the destination, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan) and groups and individuals of anonymous watched the group's movements and threaten them not to conduct the tour. Prior to this movement, those who claimed conserving marine mammals including pinnipeds, or individuals who tried to correct illegal and over-extensive hunts (including C. W. Nicol who was a sympathizer to Japan's whaling industries) or domestic medias <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> reporting assignments in Japan had been discriminated. Some of these including former fishermen who were ostracized in their communities later became whale-watching operators. Several other tours have been operated by former whalers or dolphin hunters such as at Abashiri, Muroto, and so on.|$|E
2500|$|Of the 351 municipalities, {{the number}} that are cities and {{the number that}} are towns {{is a matter of}} some ambiguity. Depending on which source is consulted, {{anywhere}} from 39 to 53 are cities. The ambiguity is the result of questions around the legal status of municipalities that have since the 1970s, through home-rule petition, adopted corporate charters approved by the state legislature with forms of government that resemble city government and do not include elements traditionally associated with town government (especially, a board of selectmen and a town meeting). Of the fourteen communities <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so, all but three call themselves a [...] "town" [...] in their municipal operations, and are usually referred to by residents as [...] "towns", but the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth's Office considers all fourteen to be legally cities. Other sources within state government often refer to all fourteen municipalities as towns, however. The U.S. federal Census Bureau listed all as towns through the 1990 Census. For the 2000 Census, some were listed by the Federal government as towns and some as cities, a situation that continues in Census materials since 2000. Massachusetts appears to be the only New England state where this issue has arisen, though other New England states also have municipalities that have adopted what amounts to city forms of government but continue to call themselves [...] "towns". In the other New England states, it does not appear that any need to officially label such municipalities as [...] "cities" [...] has been identified.|$|E

2500|$|The breath {{analyzer}} reading will {{be offered}} as evidence of that crime, although the issue is what the BrAC {{was at the time}} of driving rather than {{at the time of the}} test. Some jurisdictions, such as the State of Washington, now allow the use of breath analyzer test results without regard as to how much time passed between operation of the vehicle and the time the test was administered. The suspect will also be charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (sometimes referred to as driving or operating while intoxicated). While BrAC tests are not necessary to prove a defendant was under the influence, laws in most states require the jury to presume that he was under the influence if his BrAC is found and believed to be over 0.08 (grams of alcohol/210 liters breath) when driving. In California, this is once again demonstrated by [...] and , which states: [...] "If the People have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that a sample of the defendant's (blood/breath/urine) was taken within three hours of the defendant's [...] driving and that a chemical analysis of the sample showed a blood alcohol level of 0.08 percent or more, you may, but are not required to, conclude that the defendant's blood alcohol level was 0.08 percent or more at the time of the alleged offense." [...] This creates a rebuttable presumption, which means it is presumed, but that presumption can be rebutted if a jury finds it unreliable or if other evidence establishes a reasonable doubt as to whether the person actually drove with a breath or blood alcohol level of 0.08% or greater. [...] This would not apply to States <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> away with the presumption, such as the State of Washington, as previously referenced.|$|E
