The empirical result suggests that there are positive impacts of knowledge accumulation to value addition, and there are positive spillover effects to the surrounding regions.

40|$|The areal {{approach}} {{utilized in}} mortality analysis for {{cities in the}} past is argued to be fruitful for suburban mortality analysis as well. Through factor analysis of four Census Tract indicators, weighted scores were computed and socioeconomic groups were constructed for each <b>central</b> <b>city</b> and each suburban area for three selected metropolitan areas: Birmingham, AL, Buffalo, NY, and Indianapolis, IN. Mortality rates from Heart Diseases, Malignant Neoplasms, and All Other Causes of death were found to be inversely associated with socioeconomic status in both <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>cities</b> and <b>the</b> suburban communities of these selected metropolitan areas. Evidence points to increasing socioeconomic differentials between 1960 and 1970 especially for males for <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>cities</b> and for suburban rings in spite of reductions in mortality during this period...|$|R

5|$|A {{turning point}} came in 1777 when British forces invaded New York from Canada and laid siege to Patriots in Fort Stanwix. In August, when Brant {{learned that a}} large body of Patriot militia {{was on its way to}} relieve the fort, she sent Mohawk runners to alert the British {{commander}} of the danger. This information enabled a British, Mohawk, and Seneca force to ambush the Patriots and their Oneida allies in the Battle of Oriskany. The Iroquois were divided in their loyalties. The Oneida allied with the Patriots, while most bands of the other four nations allied with the British. After this battle, in which Iroquois warriors of these nations fought on both sides, the war in the Mohawk Valley became particularly brutal. The Oneida and rebel Americans retaliated against Brant by pillaging Canajoharie. Brant fled with her children to Onondaga, <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>city</b> of the Iroquois Confederacy. Her departure was so precipitate that she had to leave most of her belongings behind.|$|E
5|$|Another notable {{religious}} {{incident occurred}} in the central region under Cẩn's rule in 1963. A hugely oversized carp was found swimming in a small pond near <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>city</b> of Đà Nẵng. Local Buddhists began {{to believe that the}} fish was a reincarnation of one of Gautama Buddha's disciples. As pilgrimages to the pond became larger and more frequent, so did disquiet among Cẩn's district chief and his subordinates. The local law enforcement agencies mined the pond, but the fish survived. They raked the pond with machine gun fire, but the fish again survived. To deal with the tenacious fish, they called in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces, led by Colonel Lê Quang Tung under the direction of Nhu. The grenading of the pond finally killed the carp. The killing had the unintended effect of increasing the public profile of the carp, with newspapers across the world running stories about the miraculous fish. Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) helicopters began landing at the site, with paratroopers filling their bottles with water that they believed to be magical.|$|E

5|$|On 19 May 1798, a French fleet {{departed}} Toulon for a {{top secret}} destination. The force consisted of 22 warships and 120 transports, {{to be joined}} by additional forces from Genoa, Corsica and Civitavecchia as it passed south through the Ligurian Sea. The fleet's target was Egypt, a territory nominally controlled by the Ottoman Empire that French General Napoleon Bonaparte considered an ideal springboard for operations against British India. Passing southwards without interference from the Royal Navy, which had been absent from the Mediterranean for over a year following the outbreak of war between Britain and Spain, Bonaparte's convoy passed Sicily on 7 June and two days later was at anchor off the harbour of Valletta on Malta. The island nation of Malta was under the command of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, a religious order that depended on France for much of its wealth and recruits. Bonaparte believed that capturing Malta was essential to controlling the Central Mediterranean, and when Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim refused the fleet entry to the harbour, Bonaparte responded with a large scale invasion. The knights put up no resistance, although fighting against native Maltese troops lasted for 24 hours until <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>city</b> of Mdina fell. With this defeat the knights withdrew to their fortress at Valletta but were persuaded to surrender the following day with promises of pensions and estates in France.|$|E

40|$|Until the {{political}} change in 1989 no suburbanisation processes {{took place in}} the conurbations of Saxony, {{as well as in the}} conurbations of the whole former GDR. Today the conurbations of the New Länder are on the threshold of a first residential suburbanisation wave into the immediate fringe of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>cities,</b> <b>the</b> question concerning the residential suburbanisation is, • whether the conurbations of the New Länder will experience similar suburbanisation processes like in West Germany during the sixties and seventies, connected with urban sprawl and increasing segregation of the population, or • whether the process of suburbanisation will begin at a limited range. This consideration is due to the present generel conditions in East Germany, for instance a slower start of new housing construction, less available capital among the population and high unemployment. After the great migration losses 1989 / 1990 to the Old Länder a first tendency of residential suburbanisation appeard in the fringe of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>cities</b> in 1992. Contrary to the development pattern in West Germany where the city population first migrated into the suburban areas before the service industry and trades followed, this sequence was reversed in the New Länder of Germany. But the extent of residential suburbanisation is very small for the time being. It is based above all on intraregional migration gains from <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>cities.</b> It is easy to recognise the typical age pattern of young families moving into the suburban area. Migration gains are in the 25 to 45 and 0 to 15 age groups. But a change in the migration pattern with the Old Länder is also evident. The county of Dresden had in 1992 for the first time a positive net migration. Large designated housing land areas in the hinterland of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>cities</b> form <b>the</b> basis of an increasing residential suburbanisation. Only in the suburban area of Leipzig more than 1000 ha are designated. Housing construction in the suburban areas in Saxony serve primarily the condominium market. The construction of those condominiums is stongly based on specific investman tax regulations in East Germany. Presently 70 % of all condominiums are bought by investors from the Old Länder. In general, the migration from <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>cities</b> into <b>the</b> suburban areas is limited by reasons of the housing market's existing price structure.

40|$|Much of the {{development}} literature and the theory of urban transition {{have been based on}} an arbitrary division of production space into city and countryside. Despite growing recognition of the need for an integrated approach to urban-rural relations, controversial issues related to the definition and measurements of the phenomenon remain unresolved. This case study of spatial transformation in China's Pearl River Delta analyzes with greater precision the geographic extent and functional attributes of a zone of urban-rural interaction located outside and between major metropolitan centers. This zone has been the spatial focus of industrial and commercial development, although most of its population remains officially classified as "agricultural. " The peri-urban zone was initially left behind by <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>cities</b> in terms of its contribution to the regional economy. After a decade of postreform development, this zone has moved ahead of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>cities</b> and become <b>the</b> region's main destination for in-migrants and foreign investment. The growth of the zone of urban-rural interaction outside <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>cities</b> has absorbed a significant amount of the increased urban population, but it has not brought about a reduction of regional economic inequality because of the persistence of a backward economy in the periphery. Theoretical questions are raised concerning the validity of several fundamental assumptions underlying the conventional model of urban transition. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
