5|$|Sale is {{a leader}} within Trafford Council {{in the area of}} Childcare and Early {{education}} as well. Sale has a broad range of options such as after-school care, breakfast clubs, childminders, day nurseries, holiday schemes, independent school nurseries, pre-school playgroups, school nurseries. In all the areas within Trafford, Sale provides most variety and has maximum number of options in every area. In areas of After School Care, Breakfast Club, Childminder, Holiday Schemes all <b>the</b> <b>providers</b> rated by Ofsted/CQC are either Good or Outstanding. In areas of Day Nurseries (where one is rated Inadequate), Pre-School Groups (where two are rated requires improvement), School Nurseries (where one is rated Requires Improvement) most of <b>the</b> <b>providers</b> who are rated by Ofsted/CQC are again Good/Outstanding. Apart from these Sale also provides one of three Independent School Nursery in Trafford. Sale also provides a lot of options for support for childcare providers in form of advisory forums and childcare training.|$|E

But soon after the birth of Arusi, <b>the</b> <b>Providers</b> order Al•Ith to return to Zone Three without her son, and Ben Ata to marry Vahshi, queen of the primitive Zone Five. Al•Ith and Ben Ata have grown fond of each other, and are devastated by this news.|$|E

The on-demand nature of enterprise cloud computing means that consumers are not required to supply information to <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> in advance. Planning without this information is a challenge for <b>the</b> <b>provider,</b> and poor forecasting can be costly.|$|R

5|$|When Arusi is {{old enough}} to travel, Dabeeb and her band of women decide to take him to Zone Three to see Al•Ith. This {{cross-border}} excursion is not ordered by <b>the</b> <b>Providers,</b> and Ben Ata has grave misgivings about their decision. In Zone Three the women are shocked to find the deposed Al•Ith working in a stable near Zone Two. While Al•Ith is pleased to see her son, she too has misgivings about Dabeeb's action. The bumptious women's travels through Zone Three evoke feelings of xenophobia in the locals.|$|E
5|$|The story opens when <b>the</b> <b>Providers,</b> the {{invisible}} and unidentified rulers {{of all the}} Zones, order Al•Ith, queen of the peaceful paradise of Zone Three, to marry Ben Ata, king of the militarised and repressive Zone Four. Al•Ith is repulsed {{by the idea of}} consorting with a barbarian, and Ben Ata does not want a righteous queen disturbing his military campaigns. Nevertheless, Al•Ith descends to Zone Four and they reluctantly marry. Ben Ata is not used to the company of women he cannot control, and Al•Ith has difficulty relating to this ill-bred man, but in time they grow accustomed to each other and gain new insights into each other's Zones. Al•Ith is appalled that all of Zone Four's wealth goes into its huge armies, leaving the rest of its population poor and underdeveloped; Ben Ata is astounded that Zone Three has no army at all.|$|E
5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered {{to the ends of the}} earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves <b>the</b> <b>providers</b> of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E

50|$|Using a MOM system, {{a client}} makes an API call {{to send a}} message to a {{destination}} managed by <b>the</b> <b>provider.</b> <b>The</b> call invokes <b>provider</b> services to route and deliver the message. Once it has sent the message, the client can continue to do other work, confident that <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> retains <b>the</b> message until a receiving client retrieves it.

30|$|The cost {{reduction}} experienced by consumers {{is equivalent to}} the loss in revenue to <b>the</b> <b>provider.</b> If cost saved through better utilisation (and therefore less server requirements) is greater than the revenue lost, then <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> will make a net improvement in profits. As we discuss in Section 5, the pricing equations can be changed to ensure a net improvement is obtained. However, <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> often loses revenue as a result of offering discounts to consumers which subsequently fail to deliver improved utilisation. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> will lose revenue without gaining a tangible benefit in some situations, which is clearly undesirable.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} SLA model {{includes the}} conditions imposed by <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> and/or <b>the</b> consumer high level constraints (Fig. 12, bullet 2). We propose the following classification of constraints: strategic, financial, juridical, and technical. Strategic constraints represent either the strategies {{requested by the}} user or those applied by <b>the</b> <b>provider.</b> Financial constraints are the conditions related to the payment and usage patterns. Juridical constraints define legal constraints such as licensing rules, editing rights, etc. Technical constraints represent the requirements determined by <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> to execute <b>the</b> requested service. For example, <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> may require <b>the</b> user to have a specific browser for Springoo.|$|R
50|$|This {{also applies}} to customer-premises {{equipment}}, such as cable and DSL modems. In cases where <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> leases <b>the</b> equipment to the customer on a monthly basis, the CPE has a hard-coded MAC address which is on a list known to <b>the</b> <b>provider's</b> distribution networks, allowing service to be established {{as long as the}} customer is not in billing arrears. In cases where <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> allows customers to provide their own equipment (and thus avoid the monthly leasing fee on their bill,) <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> requires that <b>the</b> customer give them the MAC address of their equipment before service will be established.|$|R

25|$|There are {{concerns}} about patient privacy, with confidential reports {{going from the}} country where the patient is located (i.e. the US) to a country where the laws about privacy and patient confidentiality may not even exist, which was overcome as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) became mandatory for all <b>the</b> <b>providers</b> from the outsourced countries. Some of the countries that now outsource transcription work are the United States and Britain, with work outsourced to Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Australia, Pakistan and Barbados.|$|E
25|$|Contractors begin soliciting {{ornaments}} for {{the trees}} along the Pathway of Peace about the same time, usually around a theme. Other vendors begin contacting nationally known singers, performers, and <b>the</b> <b>providers</b> of children's characters (such as Warner Bros. Animation, Sesame Workshop, or The Walt Disney Company) for their availability. Various contractors build the decorations, depending on what is required. In 2000, Brilliant Electric Sign Co. of Cleveland, Ohio, spent four weeks building the 200 ornaments required for that year's display. Many of the decorations in 2000 and 2002 were manufactured with the same high-tech plastic {{used to make the}} faceplates of astronaut helmets.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{insuring}} entities may negotiate {{contracts with}} <b>the</b> healthcare <b>provider,</b> with a defined set of reimbursement {{values for the}} work performed by <b>the</b> <b>provider.</b> These rates may entail a significant discount from <b>the</b> amount <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> would charge an uninsured patient. For a given <b>provider,</b> <b>the</b> amount of discount varies between different insuring entities, and a separate contract is negotiated with each entity.|$|R
50|$|Dynamic DNS {{providers}} offer {{a software}} client program that automates the discovery and registration {{of the client}} system's public IP addresses. The client program is executed on a computer or device in the private network. It connects to <b>the</b> DDNS <b>provider's</b> systems with a unique login name; <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> uses <b>the</b> name to link the discovered public IP address of the home network with a hostname in the domain name system. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>provider,</b> <b>the</b> hostname is registered within a domain owned by <b>the</b> <b>provider,</b> or within <b>the</b> customer's own domain name. These services can function {{by a number of}} mechanisms. Often they use an HTTP service request since even restrictive environments usually allow HTTP service. <b>The</b> <b>provider</b> might use RFC 2136 to update the DNS servers.|$|R
30|$|Ideally, where {{options and}} {{forwards}} are not advantageous to <b>the</b> <b>provider,</b> consumers should receive no discount. However, <b>the</b> <b>provider’s</b> method for determining if contracts {{should be established}} is not perfect, and occasionally <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> confirms contracts where it is subsequently found that no scheduling advantage is realised. This could potentially be improved by running more random trials prior to confirming contracts, or using {{a number of other}} bin packing algorithms.|$|R

25|$|One {{can also}} use PowerShell {{embedded}} in a management application, which uses the PowerShell runtime to implement the management functionality. For this, PowerShell provides a managed hosting API. Via the APIs, the application can instantiate a runspace (one instantiation of the PowerShell runtime), which runs in the application's process and is exposed as a Runspace object. The state of the runspace is encased in a SessionState object. When the runspace is created, the Windows PowerShell runtime initializes the instantiation, including initializing <b>the</b> <b>providers</b> and enumerating the cmdlets, and updates the SessionState object accordingly. The Runspace then must be opened for either synchronous processing or asynchronous processing. After {{that it can be}} used to execute commands.|$|E
25|$|The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a United States {{copyright}} law that implements two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). It criminalizes {{production and dissemination}} of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works (commonly known as digital rights management or DRM). It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an access control, {{whether or not there}} is actual infringement of copyright itself. In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet. Passed on October 12, 1998, by a unanimous vote in the United States Senate and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on October 28, 1998, the DMCA amended Title 17 of the United States Code to extend the reach of copyright, while limiting the liability of <b>the</b> <b>providers</b> of online services for copyright infringement by their users.|$|E
50|$|A {{member with}} {{secondary}} insurance gives such information to <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> for <b>the</b> next bill {{to go out}} to that insurance company.

Secondary EOBs show if the patient still has any responsibility to <b>the</b> <b>provider.</b> After <b>the</b> member's insurances have processed <b>the</b> claim, <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> bills <b>the</b> member for the remaining balance, if any.|$|R
40|$|This report {{examines}} ATM Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC) and Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC) pricing from <b>the</b> network <b>provider’s</b> {{point of}} view. Specifically, {{based on previous}} work [1] that predicts customer choices between PVC and SVC service based on pricing parameters, we determine pricing parameters that will optimize <b>the</b> service <b>provider’s</b> net income, taking into account both revenue derived from customers and {{the costs associated with}} providing PVC and SVC service. The analysis is based on a general model of the user population’s traffic characteristics. The results show that by increasing bandwidth allocation prices, <b>the</b> service <b>provider</b> can encourage more users to choose SVC service, thereby increasing total revenue and reducing <b>the</b> <b>provider’s</b> bandwidth costs, but driving up <b>the</b> <b>provider’s</b> connection setup costs. The point at which <b>the</b> <b>provider’s</b> net income is maximized is strongly influenced by the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>provider’s</b> bandwidth costs and per-connection setup costs; smaller relative setup costs will motivate <b>the</b> service <b>provider</b> to encourage (through pricing parameters) more users to utilize SVC service.

This text may be printed {{and placed in the}} patient's record and/or retained only in its electronic format. Medical transcription can be performed by MTs who are employees in a hospital or who work at home as telecommuting employees for the hospital; by MTs working as telecommuting employees or independent contractors for an outsourced service that performs the work offsite under contract to a hospital, clinic, physician group or other healthcare provider; or by MTs working directly for <b>the</b> <b>providers</b> of service (doctors or their group practices) either onsite or telecommuting as employees or contractors. Hospital facilities often prefer electronic storage of medical records due to the sheer volume of hospital patients and the accompanying paperwork. The electronic storage in their database gives immediate access to subsequent departments or providers regarding the patient's care to date, notation of previous or present medications, notification of allergies, and establishes a history on the patient to facilitate healthcare delivery regardless of geographical distance or location.|$|E
25|$|HBO {{pioneered the}} free preview concept – {{which has since}} become a {{standard}} in the pay television industry – in 1973, {{as part of a}} plan to increase subscribership of the channel. Cable providers were originally granted permission to carry HBO on a local origination channel in order for those who are not subscribers the ability to view the channel for a limited number of days; with the advent of digital cable and satellite, providers now unencrypt the designated slots of each HBO channel during preview periods. Until the mid-1990s, on-air promotions featured between programs were replaced (and later, merely interspersed) with interstitials featuring on-air hosts asking viewers to subscribe to the service. Although participation was voluntary, preview events are carried by most major and some smaller pay television providers (the number of providers and <b>the</b> <b>providers</b> that choose to offer the event varies depending on the given free preview period, and may not be carried on all systems owned by a multiple system operator unless at the provider's discretion); HBO currently offers between three and five preview events each year to participating providers (which are normally scheduled to coincide with the premiere of a new or returning original series, and in the past, a high-profile special or feature film).|$|E

50|$|The SAML {{specification}} defines three roles: {{the principal}} (typically a user), <b>the</b> Identity <b>provider</b> (IdP), and <b>the</b> service <b>provider</b> (SP). In <b>the</b> use case addressed by SAML, the principal requests a service from <b>the</b> service <b>provider.</b> <b>The</b> service <b>provider</b> requests and obtains an identity assertion from <b>the</b> identity <b>provider.</b> On <b>the</b> {{basis of this}} assertion, <b>the</b> service <b>provider</b> can make an access control decision - in other words it can decide whether to perform some service for the connected principal.|$|R
