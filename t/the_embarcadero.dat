5|$|Connections to San Francisco's local {{light rail}} system, the Muni Metro, are {{facilitated}} primarily through the twin-level Market Street subway.

5|$|Two subway stations, West Portal Station and Forest Hill Station, {{and five}} of the six light-rail lines, J Church, K Ingleside, L Taraval, M Ocean View, and N Judah, are {{remnants}} of an extensive streetcar system that survived the mass conversion to buses in the 1950s. In 1980, seven subway stations, from Embarcadero Station to Castro Street Station, were opened with the inauguration of the Market Street Subway underneath Market Street, marking the conversion of San Francisco's streetcar system into the Muni Metro. In 1998, four surface stations on <b>The</b> <b>Embarcadero</b> opened, connecting the newly constructed AT Park (then called Pacific Bell Park) and Caltrain to Muni Metro. In 2007, the T Third Street line was started along 18 new surface stations built along new track laid from Caltrain down {{the eastern side of the}} city to the city line.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Embarcadero</b> is {{the eastern}} {{waterfront}} roadway of San Francisco, along San Francisco Bay. At one time busy with port and ferry related traffic, it fell into decline as freight {{transferred to the}} container terminals of Oakland and the Bay Bridge replaced the ferries. In the 1960s the elevated Embarcadero Freeway was built above, dividing the city from the bay, but was condemned and demolished after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Proposals for streetcar service along <b>The</b> <b>Embarcadero</b> were put forward as early as 1974, and historic streetcar service along <b>The</b> <b>Embarcadero</b> was first provided during the 1987 Trolley Festival, using existing Belt Railroad tracks on <b>The</b> <b>Embarcadero</b> and towed diesel generators to provide power.|$|E

25|$|On October 17, 1989, an {{earthquake}} measuring 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale struck on the San Andreas Fault near Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz mountains, approximately 70 miles (113km) south of San Francisco, {{a few minutes}} before Game 3 of the 1989 World Series was scheduled to begin at Candlestick Park. The quake severely damaged many of the city's freeways including <b>the</b> <b>Embarcadero</b> Freeway and the Central Freeway. Mayor Agnos made the controversial decision to tear down <b>the</b> <b>Embarcadero</b> Freeway, opening the waterfront but eventually shifting Chinatown voters away from him and costing him re-election in 1991.

BART and Caltrain jointly opened Millbrae station in 2003 – the largest intermodal station west of the Mississippi. San Francisco's Muni Metro has expanded service to via the sequential Third Street Light Rail Project and Central Subway (with plans for a third extension underway). The heritage streetcar service was extended to Fisherman's Wharf via constructing light rail infrastructure in place of <b>the</b> demolished <b>Embarcadero</b> Freeway, and <b>the</b> E <b>Embarcadero</b> streetcar service entered regular service in 2015 providing {{a link between the}} waterfront and Caltrain.
