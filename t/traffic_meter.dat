40|$|The {{key role}} of <b>traffic</b> <b>meter</b> for {{quality of service}} {{admission}} control internet is to control the amount of traffic injected into the differentiated service network so that congestion can be avoided to the barest minimum {{in order to meet}} certain performance requirements. This paper presents performance evaluation and analysis of two traffic meters: token bucket marker (TBM) and two rate three color marker (srTCM) QoS admission control using user datagram protocol (UDP) and transport control protocol (TCP) traffic agents. The performance measures used for the evaluation and analysis were throughput, fairness and losses. An in-depth study of the aforementioned admission control mechanisms that can enforce service level agreement (SLA) was carried out in order to suggest to the IETF which of the proposed meter would best provide QoS to users. A network simulator, ns- 2. 35 to be precise, was used to run the simulation to showcase the analysis and evaluation of the traffic meters. For TCP traffic agent, the analysis based on fairness, throughput and losses showed that the two rate three color marker with percentages 13. 15 for fairness, 98. 85 for throughput and 0. 14 for losses was better in all ramification than the token bucket marker <b>traffic</b> <b>meter</b> with percentages of 12. 50 for fairness, 96. 66 for throughput and 1. 34 losses. For UDP traffic, reverse was the case. The token bucker marker <b>traffic</b> <b>meter</b> with 24. 54 % of fairness, 62. 69 % of throughput and 37. 37 % of losses was better than the two rate three color marker <b>traffic</b> <b>meter</b> with 13. 99 % of fairness, 21. 10 % of throughput and 78. 99 % of losses...|$|E

Thus, {{there is a real}} need for a flexible billing architecture. To meet this need, a policy-based billing architecture is proposed in this paper. This architecture allows a service provider to define policies for configuring various processes of a billing system based on the charging and pricing schemes used for individual services. Definitions of policies for various charging and pricing schemes are discussed and the potential complexity of each of them is analyzed. Based on the complexity analysis four classes of services, which utilize the least complex charging schemes and require the minimum <b>traffic</b> <b>metering</b> effort, are recommended for meeting different application requirements...|$|R

This paper deals with Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which is executed by a malicious user with intention to prevent legitimate users of a service {{from using the}} desired resources by monopolizing network resource and resulting in network or system congestion. The existing queuing algorithms cannot solve this problem because they don't have any mechanism that distinguishes between legitimate traffic and malicious traffic. This paper proposes an effective traffic control scheme that can protect legitimate traffic from malicious traffic. The proposed scheme employs two kinds of queues, high-priority queue and low-priority queue. Our scheme can determine very quickly and correctly if network is congestion or not as well as which traffic is malicious by using <b>traffic</b> <b>metering.</b> According to the <b>metering</b> result, malicious <b>traffic</b> is served through low-priority queue and legitimate traffic is served through high-priority queue.

40|$|Abstract — Vehicular ad-hoc {{networks}} (VANETs) {{promise to}} enable many novel applications in transportation systems including accident avoidance, congestion sensing, <b>traffic</b> <b>metering,</b> and general in-car information services. Yet implementing multi-hop vehicular communications is highly challenging {{due to the}} highly time-varying nature of vehicles. In addition to node mobility and the impediments of wireless communication, a network comprised of moving vehicles is a dynamic system that can be fragmented into many individual components of disparate connectivity. In this paper we describe and analyze a routing scheme that exploits this dynamic connectivity {{for the purpose of}} message propagation of attributed (or labelled) data in a fragmented VANET. Our analysis provides upper and lower bounds on message propagation rate {{as a function of the}} traffic density, vehicle speed, and radio range; and sheds light into the role played by each of these network parameters. An important insight from our analysis is that vehicle mobility in the opposite traffic direction can be used to achieve substantial gains in message propagation rates. Our analytical findings are supported by extensive simulations. The simulation results indicate that under certain traffic conditions an increase in vehicle mobility results in an order-of-magnitude increase in message propagation rate. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are {{contracts}} signed {{between a}} provider and a customer {{to govern the}} amount of traffic that will be serviced. The Metro-Ethernet access network, the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture and the ATM reference model are three architectural models where edge routers perform <b>traffic</b> <b>metering</b> and coloring of aggregated flows according to the SLA. In this paper we examine an important problem faced by the Internet service provider (ISP) which is how to provide service differentiation for aggregates of multiple TCP connections that have different data volumes and packet sizes to transfer, {{as it is in}} the real Internet traffic mix. Finer color marking was suggested to improve differentiation quality. We observe that increasing the number of colors indeed provides a good differentiation between the aggregates according to the committed and the excess rates. We also show that the token bucket coloring policies, which are widely used for this purpose, prefer short packets and mark them with higher priority colors. We also show that the differentiation process is more difficult for the short TCP connections that remain in the slow start phase, than for the long connections that are usually in the congestion avoidance phase.
