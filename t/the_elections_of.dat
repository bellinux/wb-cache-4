In September 1945, Pierlot {{was appointed to the}} honorary role of Minister of State by Charles and, shortly after the 1946 election, was awarded the title of Count. Because he was considered an anti-Leopoldist during the crisis surrounding the Royal Question, he was ostracised by the pro-Leopoldist successor to the Catholic Party, the Christian Social Party (Parti social-chrétien or PSC-CVP).|$|E

5|$|During {{the peace}} Jervis married his cousin Martha, {{daughter}} of Lord Chief Baron Sir Thomas Parker. Jervis was also returned as MP for Launceston in 1783. Jervis began {{his political career}} in earnest and voted for Pitt's parliamentary reforms and against Charles James Fox and his East India Bill. During <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>of</b> 1784 Jervis stood for election in the independent borough of Great Yarmouth where he was returned as MP alongside Henry Beaufoy. Jervis then voted against Pitt's further bills for reform but supported him once more during the 1788–1799 Regency Crisis.|$|E
5|$|Feminists in Ireland in {{the early}} 20th century {{included}} the revolutionary Irish Republican, suffragette and socialist Constance Markievicz who in 1918 {{was the first woman}} elected to the British House of Commons. However, in line with Sinn Féin abstentionist policy, she would not take her seat in the House of Commons. She was re-elected to the Second Dáil in <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>of</b> 1921. She was also a commander of the Irish Citizens Army which was led by the socialist & self-described feminist, Irish leader James Connolly during the 1916 Easter Rising.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>of</b> September 1857, {{the entire}} Partida Națională chose to support Cuza for the Moldavian throne.

5|$|In 1935 Azaña and Indalecio Prieto {{started to}} unify the left and to combat its extreme elements. They staged large, popular rallies of {{what would become the}} Popular Front. Lerroux's Radical {{government}} collapsed after two major scandals, including the Straperlo affair. However, Zamora did not allow the CEDA to form a government, instead calling elections. <b>The</b> <b>elections</b> <b>of</b> 1936 were won by the Popular Front, with vastly smaller resources than the political right who followed Nazi propaganda techniques. The right began to plan how to best overthrow the Republic, rather than taking control of it.|$|E
5|$|James Fisher Robinson (October 4, 1800 – October 31, 1882) was the 22nd Governor of Kentucky, {{serving the}} {{remainder}} of the unfinished term of Governor Beriah Magoffin. Magoffin, a Confederate sympathizer, became increasingly ineffective after <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>of</b> 1861 yielded a supermajority to pro-Union forces in both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly. Magoffin agreed to resign the governorship, provided he could select his successor. He selected Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Leading up to <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>of</b> 1970, Tydings faced {{criticism}} {{from both parties}} for his actions as senator. In July 1970, syndicated columnist Marquis Childs noted that Tydings' problems on the left stemmed from his support of a crime bill for the District of Columbia, which was perceived as repressive against African Americans. There was also criticism directed at the bill for writing into law the practices of preventive detention and no knock warrants.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>elections</b> <b>of</b> autumn 1790 {{resulted}} in {{a new group of}} deputies joining those already elected. A second Marshal of the Sejm was elected (Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha). As Małachowski was seen as associated with the reformers, Sapieha was initially seen as a conservative, although he would later switch sides and join the reformers. The doubled number of deputies exceeded the capacity of the parliament chambers, and not all of the deputies could secure a seat; public interest also grew and the entire building and the observation galleries were often overcrowded.|$|E
5|$|The twin {{policies}} of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan led to billions in economic and military aid for Western Europe, Greece, and Turkey. With the US assistance, the Greek military won its civil war. Under the leadership of Alcide De Gasperi the Italian Christian Democrats defeated the powerful Communist-Socialist alliance in <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>of</b> 1948. At {{the same time there}} was increased intelligence and espionage activity, Eastern Bloc defections and diplomatic expulsions.|$|E
5|$|While Lafayette was {{returning}} to France, LouisXVIII died, and CharlesX took the throne. As king, Charles intended to restore the absolute rule of the monarch, and his decrees had already prompted protest by the time Lafayette arrived. Lafayette was {{the most prominent of}} those who opposed the king. In <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>of</b> 1827, the 70-year-old Lafayette was elected to the Chamber of Deputies again. Unhappy at the outcome, Charles dissolved the Chamber, and ordered a new election: Lafayette again won his seat.|$|E

5|$|Zimbabwe's first {{president}} after its independence was Canaan Banana {{in what was}} originally a mainly ceremonial role as Head of State. Robert Mugabe, leader of the ZANU party, was the country's first Prime Minister and Head of Government. During <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>of</b> February 1980, Robert Mugabe and the ZANU party secured a landslide victory.|$|E
5|$|A House select {{committee}} headed by John Quincy Adams, an ardent abolitionist who disliked slaveholders like Tyler, condemned the president's {{use of the}} veto and assailed his character. While the committee's report did not formally recommend impeachment, it clearly established the possibility, and in August 1842 the House endorsed the committee's report. Adams sponsored {{a constitutional amendment to}} change both houses' two-thirds requirement (for overriding vetoes) to a simple majority, but neither house approved. The Whigs were unable to pursue further impeachment proceedings in the subsequent 28th Congress—in <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>of</b> 1842 they retained a majority in the Senate but lost control of the House. Near the end of Tyler's term in office, on March 3, 1845, Congress overrode his veto of a minor bill relating to revenue cutters—the first override of a presidential veto.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>of</b> 2011, Mirela Holy, who had {{declared}} her {{opposition to the}} project prior to the elections, was appointed Minister of Environment and Nature Protection. In 2012 the ministry commissioned four reviews of the EIA. The reviews—one of them supporting the EIA and three disproving the conclusions of the original EIA—were submitted to the Government of Croatia one day after Holy resigned her post, reportedly over an unrelated matter, on 7 June 2012. Objections were raised by authors of the EIA that the reviews were not published {{and the names of}} the authors have been kept secret. Prime Minister Zoran Milanović said he wanted to collect opinions from the foremost Croatian, European, and worldwide experts before deciding on the matter, which has been under consideration since the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|After the {{proclamation}} of the People's Republic of Romania on 30 December 1947, {{the existence of}} all parties other than the PCR had become purely formal, and, after <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>of</b> 28 March the one-party state was confirmed by legislation. He was arrested on 5 May 1950, and held in the notorious Sighet prison (alongside three of his brothers — Ștefan Tătărescu included — and his former collaborator Bejan). His son Tudor, who was living in Paris, suffered from schizophrenia after 1950, {{and had to be}} committed to an institution (where he died in 1955). Sandra Tătărescu Negropontes was also imprisoned in 1950, and released three years later, upon the death of Joseph Stalin.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{cardinals}} have historically gathered at {{a handful of}} other locations within Rome and beyond, only five elections since 1455 have been held outside the Apostolic Palace. Twenty-eight papal elections have been held outside Rome, in: Terracina (1088), Cluny (1119), Velletri (1181), Verona (1185), Ferrara (October 1187), Pisa (December 1187), Perugia (1216, 12641265, 1285, 12921294, 13041305), Anagni (1243), Naples (1254, 1294), Viterbo (1261, 12681271, July 1276, August–September 1276, 1277, 12811282), Arezzo (January 1276), Carpentras/Lyon (13141316), Avignon (1334, 1342, 1352, 1362, 1370), Konstanz (1417) and Venice (17991800).

5|$|Although {{the newly}} formed BJP was {{technically}} distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president. Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian Socialism. This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>of</b> 1984. The assassination of Indira Gandhi {{a few months earlier}} resulted in a wave of support for the Congress which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP.|$|E

50|$|The rulings of this Council {{concerning}} <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> popes were gradually eroded {{over the}} course of the decades and centuries.
