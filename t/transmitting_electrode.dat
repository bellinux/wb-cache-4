The sensor comprises an electrode arrangement having a <b>transmitting</b> <b>electrode</b> (16), a receiving electrode (18) and a first shielding electrode (20), which are arranged in a coplanar manner {{on a plane and}} can be positioned above or below, adjacent to the fluid channel (14), wherein the <b>transmitting</b> <b>electrode</b> (16) and the receiving electrode (18) are capacitively coupled in that they each have an adjacently arranged edge having a dielectric therebetween.

40|$|Conductance {{switching}} {{has been}} reported in many molecular junction devices, but in most cases has not been convincingly explained. We investigate conductance switching in Pt/stearic acid monolayer/Ti devices using pressure-modulated conductance microscopy. For devices with conductance G>>G_Q or G<<G_Q, where GQ= 2 e^ 2 /h is the conductance quantum, pressure-induced conductance peaks < 30 nm in diameter are observed, indicating the formation of nanoscale conducting pathways between the electrodes. For devices with G~ 1 - 2 G_Q, in addition to conductance peaks we also observed conductance dips and oscillations in response to localized pressure.

40|$|A {{new method}} called HF-densitometry is introduced, which {{measures}} relative density variations along wood surfaces utilizing the dielectric properties of wood. The method {{is based on}} the propagation of continu-ous electromagnetic waves in a high-frequency (HF) transmitter-receiver link of an extremely small electrode system, which is in direct contact with the wood surface investigated. The electromagnetic field emitted by the <b>transmitting</b> <b>electrode</b> propagates through a small volume of the wood sample to the receiving electrode, located very close to the trans-mitting electrode. The received signal strength is directly influenced by the dielectric properties of the material along the propagation path. The variation of the relative dielectric constant in different wood structures is correlated with the density variations in a way the received signal strength increases with increasing wood density. The dielectric measur-ing device, developed {{on the basis of the}} new method, allows non-de-structive, extremely fast measurements of wood density variations.

40|$|The {{vibrations}} {{produced in}} the electrodes urrounding a polypropylene foil in a three-layer capacitive microphone under an a-e field are analyzed.

In the ease of transmitted excitation, electrostriction of the central dielectric layer was to be ruled out as an explanation of the observed effects.

40|$|Transparent and {{conducting}} thin SnO 2 films have numerous applications as heating elements, antistatic coatings and light <b>transmitting</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The {{aim of this}} work {{was to determine the}} phase composition of the SnOx (1 ≤x≤ 2) thin films obtained on the glass substrates by DC reactive sputtering of metallic tin. The samples were prepared in Ar+O 2 mixture for which oxygen concentration was varied. The Mössbauer spectra for six samples obtained at various oxygen concentration in the chamber during the sputtering were measured in a transmission geometry using the BaSn source. The measurements were done at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures. The isomer shift and quadrupole splitting values of pure and stoichiometric SnO 2, α-SnO and β-Sn were used for the identification of the phases which are observable in the MS. The fitted values of the Mössbauer parameters for the measured spectra are listed in Table I. As expected the fraction for the SnO 2 phase increases with oxygen concentration in the cahmber, on the contrary the fraction of the SnO decreases and dor the higher oxygen concentrations the films are composed of the SnO 2 phase only. Due to the small recoil free fraction for the Sn lattice at room temperature, the MS taken at 293 K are free from the lines which might be attributed to that phase. At liquid nitrogen temperature at which recoil free fractions for Sn, SnO and SnO 2 are comparable the Sn phase was found in the film obtained at the lowest oxygen concentration 4. 8 %. The percentage contribution of the particular phases present in the films were estimated comparing the areas over the MS lines and taking to the account the different values of the recoil free fractions. The samples were also X-ray analysed. The α-Sn and β-SnO phases are being revealed in the diffraction pattern for the sample obtained at 4. 8 % oxygen concentration in the chamber. Only the α-SnO phase was recorded in the samples obtained at 6. 8 % and 8. 0 % oxygen concentration. In the other samples the SnO 2 phase appears in addition to the disappearing SnO phase. Our conclusions are : 1 / For the low oxygen concentration in the chamber, the SnO 2 phase {{turns out to be a}} noncrystalline solid solution in the SnO matrix; 2 / As the oxygen concentration increases the amount of the α-SnO phase diminishes and the SnO 2 crystalline phase emages...|$|R
50|$|DIAMOND uses an {{algorithm}} {{that allows}} it to automatically detect food intake. When DIAMOND senses that food has entered the stomach, energy from a rechargeable pulse generator is <b>transmitted</b> to <b>electrodes</b> attached to the gastric antrum. DIAMOND provides non-excitatory electrical stimulation, which causes increased contractile force {{to each of the}} naturally occurring rhythmic stomach contractions (normal stomach peristalsis). In this way, DIAMOND strengthens stomach contractions to a similar level that occurs when the normal stomach is emptying the food content into the duodenum. The stronger antral contractions activate the gut-brain-liver axis just as they do normally when food is entering the duodenum. Signals are sent from the stomach along afferent vagal nerve fibers to the hypothalamus, which interprets the signals to mean that food has departed the stomach. In this way, DIAMOND induces early satiety. The hypothalamus also sends signals to the pancreas to release insulin and to suppress glucagon. Signals are also sent to the liver to stop production of glucose and start using glucose to synthetize glycogen. In this way, DIAMOND resynchronizes the metabolic response to food intake and improves blood glucose levels.|$|R

40|$|An {{external}} device for receiving radio frequency (RF) encoded neurological signals is presented. RF-encoded neurological signals often require high data-rates to <b>transmit</b> from multiple <b>electrodes</b> with 10 -bit resolution per channel. The transmission frequency is a frequency-shift key (FSK) modulated, 2. 45 GHz signal with a 100 MHz bandwidth.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the adaptation {{and the use}} of the CESAR-LCPC finite element code for the forward and inverse modelling of 3 D resistivity data. These codes are better suited for imaging structures with complex geometries. The forward modelling code uses an electrode-independent mesh that allows to place the electrodes at their exact locations and to use a coarse mesh at the same time. In this approach, the choice for the mesh size is solely governed by the need for accurate results. It is also possible to calculate apparent resistivities, without the use of the geometrical factor (that can be evaluated only for simple structures). To calculate apparent resistivity values, a normalisation approach is used that gives significantly better results than the use of the geometrical factor and allows the modelling of any kind of complex 3 D structure. As a singularity removal technique cannot be used on complex 3 D models, a minimum of 5 to 6 nodes between two current <b>transmitting</b> <b>electrodes</b> should be considered to guarantee the quality of the results. Synthetic results are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the forward modelling technique. An inversion code was also presented for the processing of resistivity tomographies on complex 3 D structures using any electrode arrangement. This algorithm is well suited for the processing of large data sets with a lot of unknown model parameters. The inversion code uses an original strategy to avoid the explicit calculation of a sensitivity matrix. The adjoint-state of the potential field is used to minimize an objective function for the electrical inverse problem. Then, a steepest descent formulation can be used for the first iteration. Further iterations are carried out using a conjugate gradient approach to improve the convergence. As can be seen on synthetic data, a satisfactory reconstruction of the models can be achieved with a minor computational cost. This kind of inverse problem would have been very difficult to solve using a more traditional Gauss-Newton approach. Strategies are nevertheless needed to improve the stabilisation of the inverse process and to include a priori information in the problem. Finally, a ROI (Region Of Investigation) index method is used to assess whether features in the model are caused by the data or are artefacts of the inversion process. This method carries out two inversions of the same data set using different values of the reference resistivity model. The two inversions reproduce the same resistivity values in areas where the data contain information about the resistivity of the subsurface whereas the final result depends on the reference resistivity in areas where the data do not constrain the model. Ce travail a pour objectif la mise au point d'un ensemble d'outils de modélisation directe et inverse en utilisant le code d'éléments finis CESAR-LCPC.

40|$|The {{research}} performed {{under this}} grant has been principally devoted to understanding and quantifying {{the relationship between}} the macroscopic electrical transport properties of ZnO based materials and the properties of their grain boundaries. Two forms of polycrystalline ZnO have been extensively investigated, polycrystalline thin films, such as are used as optically <b>transmitting,</b> conducting <b>electrodes</b> and as piezoelectric films, and polycrystalline bulk forms, such as are widely used as surge arrestors. The former are essentially two-dimensional and the latter three-dimensional. The research has included both simulation and experimental studies. The simulation studies have been primarily addressing how the macroscopic properties of bulk ZnO ceramics are determined by the electrical and crystallographic properties of their grain boundaries. The behavior of varistors has been the focus since the highly nonlinear electrical characteristics provide an opportunity to test the models in much greater detail than is possible if the characteristics were simply ohmic. Furthermore, there is a continuing desire to improve varistor characteristics, such as the sharpness of the switching voltage and the degree of nonlinearity, so the effect of grain boundary variations on these parameters have been specifically addressed and found to quantitatively depend on the variation in both grain size and grain boundary barrier height. New methods of quantifying the effect of microstructural variations on the I-V characteristics have been introduced. The simulations have included both electrical network methods and effective medium methods. During the course of the research, the studies were extended to describe electrical breakdown, specifically on how microstructural variations lead to current localization which in turn leads to a form of electrical discharge failure, a common form of failure of varistors under electrical loading...|$|R

Early on he seemed to borrow from the ideas of Mahlon Loomis, proposing a system composed of balloons to suspend <b>transmitting</b> and receiving <b>electrodes</b> in the air above [...] in altitude, where he thought the pressure would allow him to send high voltages (millions of volts) long distances. To further study the conductive nature of low pressure air he set up a test facility at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899. Experiments he conducted there with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, as well as observations he made of the electronic noise of lightning strikes, led him to conclude incorrectly that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy. The theory included driving alternating current pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil working against an elevated capacitance to make the potential of the Earth oscillate. Tesla thought this would allow alternating current to be received with a similar capacitive antenna tuned to resonance with it at any point on Earth with very little power loss. His observations also led him to believe a high voltage used in a coil at an elevation of a few hundred feet would [...] "break the air stratum down", eliminating the need for miles of cable hanging on balloons to create his atmospheric return circuit. Tesla would go on the next year to propose a [...] "World Wireless System" [...] that was to broadcast both information and power worldwide. In 1901, at Shoreham, New York he attempted to construct a large high-voltage wireless power station, now called Wardenclyffe Tower, but by 1904 investment dried up and the facility was never completed.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop novel capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) arrays for intravascular ultrasonic (IVUS) imaging along with the fabrication processes to allow for monolithic integration of CMUTs with custom CMOS electronics for improved performance. The IVUS imaging arrays include dual-ring arrays for forward-looking volumetric imaging in coronary arteries and annular-ring arrays with dynamic focusing capabilities for side-looking cross sectional imaging applications. Both are capable of integration into an IVUS catheter 1 - 2 mm in diameter. The research aim of monolithic integration of CMUTs with custom CMOS electronics has been realized mainly through the use of sloped sidewall vias less than 5 µm in diameter, with only one additional masking layer as compared to regular CMUT fabrication. Fabrication of CMUTs has been accomplished with a copper sacrificial layer reducing isolation layers by 50 %. Modeling techniques for computational efficient analysis of CMUT arrays were developed for arbitrary geometries and further expanded for use with larger signal analysis. Dual-ring CMUT arrays for forward-looking volumetric imaging have been fabricated with diameters of less than 2 mm with center frequencies at 10 MHz and 20 MHz, respectively, for an imaging range from 1 mm to 1 cm. These arrays, successfully integrated with custom CMOS electronics, have generated 3 D volumetric images with only 13 cables necessary. Performance from optimized fabrication has reduced the bias required for a dual-ring array element from 80 V to 42 V and in conjunction with a full <b>electrode</b> <b>transmit</b> array, it was shown that the SNR can be improved by 14 dB.

RESULTS: 1) Electrode design. Non-corrugated TIME electrodes with different dimensions and 8 - 12 active sites have been manufactued and tested in vivo and in vitro testing in the rat and pig. Methods for corrugated prototypes were developed and the first prototypes were realized. 2) Electrode selectivity modeling. A peripheral nerve model is under development to evaluate the electrode's selective stimulation properties and to optimize electrode design. Simulated currents and neural activity generated were qualitatively assessed using experimental data obtained from rat nerves. 3) Implant modeling. To optimize the implantation procedure, a theoretical peripheral nervous tissue model and a 3 D FEM was implemented. Both models closely reproduce the experimental peripheral nervous tissue behaviour and simulate the insertion forces <b>transmitted</b> to the <b>electrode</b> during implantation. 4) Multi-channel stimulators and connectors. A 12 -pole prototype, bench-top stimulator has been implemented and successfully tested in animal experiments.

40|$|In recent years, {{projected}} capacitance {{has become}} {{by far the}} most used method of touchscreen sensing in the consumer electronics industry. Touch screen panels (TSPs) consist of varying transparent layers of lens, substrate, adhesive and indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrodes. ITO has become the material of choice for manufacturing TSPs due to its high conductivity and high transparency. A touch is detected when there is a change in mutual capacitance between <b>transmitting</b> and receiving <b>electrodes</b> embedded the touch-screen. As a core feature in all aspects of modern electronics, there is a constant need to reevaluate and customize existing designs. Utilizing computer simulations allows a designer to predict the behavior of a design without building the physical sensor. Simulations have 3 main uses for touch-screen developers. (1) Building and testing new prototype designs, (2) optimization of existing designs and (3) testing the linearity and uniformity of existing designs due to vendor process variation. This thesis asks the questions: “What key metrics characterize a good TSP?” and “How can TSP designs be optimized using computer simulations?” This thesis contains a literature review of recent simulation approaches and review of the rise of projected capacitance technology in the touch-screen industry. The main focus of this thesis is the electrostatic simulation of touch-screen sensors. The relevant physics of electromagnetism is introduced and the dominant mathematical methods of simulation are reviewed and compared - namely the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Method of Moments (MOM). Both these methods are used in experimental studies. The operation of a typical sensor and the mechanism of mutual capacitance is explained and accompanied by an equivalent circuit diagram. Important features of sensor design are introduced such as typical patterns, stack-ups, and trace routes. Simulations produce a capacitance matrix. From this matrix critical parameters which characterize sensor performance are derived such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and change in mutual capacitance (ΔCm). Several experimental studies of contrasting pattern designs and stack-ups are conducted in order to demonstrate optimization of touch-screen designs. Within each simulation, features of the design are paramaterized in order to perform parametric sweeps. These sweeps can include layer thickness, relative permittivity of a layer, sensor pitch and size of a specific geometric feature. In each case, several parameters of the design are varied and the effect on the capacitances are recorded. From these values the critical parameters of the sensor are determined along with the overall performance of the sensor. A design-of-experiments (DOE) methodology is also described in order to demonstrate the optimal simulation for a touch-screen design with an exhaustive number of variable parameters. This thesis also examines some of the implications of limited computational resources and its effect on solution time and convergence. Methods of decreasing the computational load will also be discussed. In summary, this body of work serves as a complete guide in the designing, running and analysis of electromagnetic simulations for modern TSPs...|$|R
40|$|Geophysical {{investigations}} of subsurface lithologic units in regions of thick, unsaturated, and poorly consolidated sediments {{have always been}} a problem in exploration geophysics. An experimental high-resolution seismic refraction profile and four geoelectric surveys were acquired in a problem area of this nature near Orchard, Idaho. The objective was to test the viability of using these techniques to do detailed subsurface mapping of sedimentary/volcanic interfaces underlying this portion of the western Snake River Plain. Although only standard methods were employed, the refraction and geoelectric surveys produced results which are internally consistent and consistent with information obtained from nearby boreholes. The refraction survey was conducted at a location locally referred to as Orchard Ranch. Eight 24 -channel geophone spreads, with a 5 -m station interval, were used to acquire the data resulting in 920 m of subsurface coverage. A buried explosive energy source was utilized at inline offsets of 100 m and 0 m from both ends of each receiver spread. Data analysis was conducted using two independent processing techniques including the reciprocal method (RM) and a refraction statics software package developed by Green Mountain Geophysical Corporation. The RM technique computes refractor depths as the product of a time-depth and depth conversion factor for every receiver. Refractor depths were computed from north to south with forced depth ties between spreads at stations of overlap. The Green Mountain technique uses a ray theory model of seismic waves in the near surface layers of the earth to estimate layer geometries and velocities. Refractor depths are derived from time-terms computed for each receiver, and time differences between each shot/receiver pair. This method uses constant layer velocities in the computation. The refractor depth models generated from the RM and the Green Mountain analyses reveal very similar features: a slightly irregular refractor surface at depths of 30 - 45 m with an abrupt discontinuity in the vicinity of Station 87. This discontinuity has been interpreted as representing either a down-to-the-south normal fault or a flow edge of a younger basalt overlying a deeper, and older, basalt unit. A second study conducted at the Orchard Ranch site involved the acquisition, processing, and interpretation of resistivity data collected from four separate geoelectric soundings to map stratigraphic boundaries in the subsurface, both laterally and with depth. These included a single point Schlumberger vertical sounding, 20 -m and 60 -m dipole-dipole profiles, and a controlled source audiomagnetotelluric (CSAMT) survey. The first set of resistivity data was acquired using a symmetric expanding Schlumberger electrode configuration running parallel to a seismic refraction line acquired in a previous study (Howarth, 1989, Line 1), and centered about the midpoint (Station 100) between the PVC and the Orchard Ranch wells. One-dimensional inversion of the data using an automatic interpretation program (Zohdy, 1989) resulted in a 16 -layer resistivity model. By imposing constraints based on the available geologic information, an equivalent four-layer model was established using an iterative process of inversion and forward modeling. The resultant model reveals three layers of differing resistivities within the unconsolidated sediments in the near surface, underlain by a highly resistive basalt at a depth of 30 m. The second set of resistivity data was acquired using a dipole-dipole electrode configuration. Two separate surveys, using 20 -m and 60 -m electrode separations (a-spacings), were conducted parallel to Line 1 beginning at the PVC well and ending near the Orchard Ranch well, providing resistivity data both laterally and vertically. Measurements were made at each field setup corresponding to n-spacings of 1, 2, 3, and 4. Pseudo-sections of apparent resistivity versus n-spacing allowed for qualitative interpretations of the data. In general, the near-surface sediments contain a shallow layer of high apparent resistivity, overlying a section of relatively low apparent resistivity. The absence of an abrupt resistivity increase in the deepest resistivity samples (60 -m dipole pseudo-section) may indicate that the basalt was not reached. The last survey was a CSAMT profile conducted along {{the entire length of the}} Line 1 refraction survey. A <b>transmitting</b> current <b>electrode</b> separation of 1525 m, located 1825 m due east of, and parallel to, refraction Line 1, was used in conjunction with a potential electrode spacing of 20 m and a magnetic coil to record orthogonal horizontal components of the electric and magnetic fields at 47 surface locations. This current and potential electrode separation distance was in excess of the 3 skin depth (far field) minimum separation necessary to ensure plane wave behavior for the resistivity and phase measurements. The CSAMT resistivity and phase data were processed with Zonge Engineering DATPRO software. A 2 -D smooth model inversion algorithm generated an earth resistivity model for a depth range of 50 - 400 m. This range likely falls entirely within the massive basalt unit as suggested from well logs. Two anomalous features stand out in the model. A region of extremely high resistivity in excess of 6000 Ω-m (as opposed to an average basalt resistivity of 200 Ω-m) appears near the vicinity of the Orchard Ranch well. This is most likely due to recording in a scrap metal dumping site near a steel cased well which has significantly contaminated the data and caused an unreliable inversion. A second notable feature is the presence of elevated resistivity vertical zonation at various locations along the profile. This has been interpreted as representing air-filled porosity within the basalt, possibly related to fractures or large void spaces...|$|R
40|$|In modern society, {{the body}} health {{is a very}} {{important}} issue to everyone. With the development of the science and technology, the new and developed body health monitoring device and technology will play the key role in the daily medical activities. This paper focus on making progress {{in the design of the}} wearable vital sign system. A vital sign monitoring system has been proposed and designed. The whole detection system is composed of signal collecting subsystem, signal processing subsystem, short-range wireless communication subsystem and user interface subsystem. The signal collecting subsystem is composed of light source and photo diode, after emiting light of two different wavelength, the photo diode collects the light signal reflected by human body tissue. The signal processing subsystem is based on the analog front end AFE 4490 and peripheral circuits, the collected analog signal would be filtered and converted into digital signal in this stage. After a series of processing, the signal would be transmitted to the short-range wireless communication subsystem through SPI, this subsystem is mainly based on Bluetooth 4. 0 protocol and ultra-low power System on Chip(SoC) nRF 51822. Finally, the signal would be transmitted to the user end. After proposing and building the system, this paper focus on the research of the key component in the system, that is, the photo detector. Based on the study of the perovskite materials, a low temperature processed photo detector has been proposed, designed and researched. The device is made up of light absorbing layer, electron transporting and hole blocking layer, hole transporting and electron blocking layer, conductive substrate layer and metal electrode layer. The light absorbing layer is the important part of whole device, and it is fabricated by perovskite materials. After accepting the light, the electron-hole pair would be produced in this layer, and due to the energy level difference, the electron and hole produced would be <b>transmitted</b> to metal <b>electrode</b> and conductive substrate electrode through electron transporting layer and hole transporting layer respectively. In this way the response current would be produced. Based on this structure, the specific fabrication procedure including substrate cleaning; PEDOT:PSS layer preparation; pervoskite layer preparation; PCBM layer preparation; C 60, BCP, and Ag electrode layer preparation. After the device fabrication, a series of morphological characterization and performance testing has been done. The testing procedure including film-forming quality inspection, response current and light wavelength analysis, linearity and response time and other optical and electrical properties testing. The testing result shows that the membrane has been fabricated uniformly; the device can produce obvious response current to the incident light with the wavelength from 350 nm to 800 nm, and the response current could be changed along with the light wavelength. When the light wavelength keeps constant, there exists a good linear relationship between the intensity of the response current and the power of the incident light, based on which the device could be used as the photo detector to collect the light information. During the changing period of the light signal, the response time of the device is several microseconds, which is acceptable working as a photo detector in our system. The testing results show that the device has good electronic and optical properties, and the fabrication procedure is also repeatable, the properties of the devices has good uniformity, which illustrates the fabrication method and procedure could be used to build the photo detector in our wearable system. Based on a series of testing results, the paper has drawn the conclusion that the photo detector fabricated could be integrated on the flexible substrate and is also suitable for the monitoring system proposed, thus made some progress on the research of the wearable monitoring system and device. Finally, some future prospect in system design aspect and device design and fabrication aspect are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the start}} of the {{industrial}} revolution, access to large amounts of energy has driven human development. Decades of energy exploration have led to the use of coal, petroleum, natural gas and uranium. Today, climate change and environmental concerns are steering scientific research in the direction of renewable energy sources. More than half of the newly installed power capacity worldwide consists of hydroelectric, solar, wind and geothermal power. In this work a strategy is investigated to complement renewable power with renewable fuels. This strategy is solar water splitting. In solar water splitting, solar energy is used to split the water molecule into its constituents, hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen may be used as a reducing agent to obtain other products or can be directly used as a fuel to once again generate water. In this work, a two-compartment reactor is built with an ion exchange membrane separator. On either side of the membrane, a catalyst-coated carbon electrode is pressed. One electrode is coated with titanium dioxide semiconductor and faces a window to receive sunlight. Photons which exceed the band gap energy of the semiconductor excite electrons to the conduction band, leaving a hole in the valence band. The holes are at a sufficiently positive potential to oxidise water and produce molecular oxygen and protons. The oxygen gas is evacuated and the protons are transported through the ion exchange membrane to the second electrode. The conduction band electrons are <b>transmitted</b> to this <b>electrode</b> through an external circuit. The second electrode is coated with platinum catalyst, which performs the hydrogen evolution reaction using the proton and electron products from the titanium dioxide electrode. The hydrogen gas is thus produced in a separate compartment. Crossover of hydrogen and oxygen is prevented by the membrane separator. Such a photoelectrochemical reactor simultaneously manages the transport and reaction of photons, electrons, ions and molecules. There are many possible reactor designs which all follow similar principles. In Chapter 1, an account is given of the current stage of development of photoelectrochemical reactors. Their operation, recent progress and forthcoming directions are discussed. Over the last decade, increasing attention was given to integrated, autonomous cells. Their design has evolved from typical two- or three-electrode laboratory setups towards two-compartment sealed reactors with well-defined dimensions that require no external bias. In this work the monolithic, porous assembly of membrane and electrodes allows for free choice of operating conditions. An unavoidable requirement of electrochemical cells is the presence of a conducting pathway between anode and cathode. In practice a liquid electrolyte with high ionic strength is commonly used. In the monolithic assembly, the ion exchange membrane serves as solid electrolyte with charged sulfonic groups that are fixed to the polymer backbone. A flow of pure liquid water can be used, which contains no dissolved salts. Gas phase operation is possible, without requiring any liquid at all. Depending on the conditions used, the current response of the cell under illumination changes. In Chapter 2, the chronoamperometric cell signature is analysed by varying the operating conditions. Observed effects are attributed to capacitive charging of the semiconductor, build-up and side reactions of hydrogen and oxygen products, membrane dehydration and a proton concentration gradient. From this investigation it is clear that photoelectrochemical cells are complex systems that require a fine-tuned interplay of all the active components. In Chapter 3, layer-by-layer deposition is explored as a strategy to assemble these components. Layer-by-layer deposition is a versatile technique {{with a high degree of}} control over the type and amount of deposited material. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles are embedded in a polymer matrix to fabricate electrodes with low mass loading and high specific activity. The same type of film is also used for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. In Chapter 4, the original reactor is revisited to explore a new concept: gas phase operation using outside air as the source of water. The reactor is installed on a rooftop to give the first ever demonstration of hydrogen production using solely natural sunlight and outside air. For this demonstration electrodes are fabricated using atomic layer deposition on carbon nanotubes to obtain thin film architectures which are inert towards molecular oxygen present in air. The operation in air opens completely new possibilities for solar hydrogen production. Contrary to liquid-based devices, gas bubbles, frost, membrane poisoning nor corrosion cause problems. Moreover, only limited peripherals are needed and no source of clean water. In Chapter 5, the state of the art of photoelectrochemical water splitting and photovoltaic-driven electrolysis is discussed, along with the potential of air-based water splitting. A model is built which shows that air contains about ten times more water than is required to run such devices. In Chapter 6 of this thesis, the potential role of solar fuels in a global energy landscape is investigated. More than half of our energy consumption requires fuels and a large portion of this could be supplied by air-based water splitting. Solar fuel production is usually envisioned as large-scale plants in deserts, using high-maintenance equipment and transporting the fuel to end users by pipelines or trucks. In this work, a second type of solar fuel production is added to the portfolio: smaller scale autonomous devices which readily produce hydrogen from the sun and the air that surround us. status: publishe...|$|R
