5|$|Article 9(2) of the Constitution enshrines {{the right}} of persons who have been {{detained}} <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> High Court challenging the legality of their detention. The application is for an order for review of detention, which was formerly called a writ of habeas corpus. The Court is required to inquire into the complaint, and order the detainee to be produced before the Court and released unless it is satisfied that the detention is lawful.|$|E
5|$|Because the Bill of Rights did not {{initially}} {{apply to the}} states, and federal criminal investigations were less common {{in the first century}} of the nation's history, there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century. The amendment was held <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> states in Mapp v. Ohio (1961).|$|E
5|$|In some {{interpretations of}} the novella, the male {{characters}} represent patriarchal society, with Hyde signifying its moral corruption. Other interpretations suggest {{that the lack of}} female companionship for the male characters indicates their latent homosexuality and that Hyde is engaged in homosexual activity. These interpretations are harder <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> play because of Sullivan's addition of female characters and heterosexual relationships.|$|E

With {{the exception of the}} Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment, and (maybe) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment, all of the criminal procedure provisions of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state governments.|$|E
5|$|Students {{and faculty}} members of Cornell University are invited <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Telluride House in a yearly process known as 'preferment'. Preferment, like other house matters, is decided on democratically by house members. However, faculty {{members of the house}} cannot vote. Telluride House members also {{contribute}} to the Association's work, through reading and evaluating applications for Telluride programs, such as the Telluride Association Summer Program.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Amendment {{prevents}} most warrantless searches by {{law enforcement}} officers, and since Weeks v. United States (1914), has been enforced by the exclusionary rule, which excludes most evidence gathered through Fourth Amendment violations from criminal trials. While Wolf v. Colorado (1949) had held the amendment <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> states, {{a process known as}} incorporation, the exclusionary rule had explicitly not been incorporated by the decision. Evidence gathered by state law enforcement was therefore not yet bound by the same strictures as that gathered by federal law enforcement.|$|E

5|$|The {{fight for}} the {{national}} government to assume state debt was a longer issue, and lasted over four months. During the period, the resources that Hamilton was <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> payment of state debts was requested by Alexander White, and was rejected due to Hamilton's {{not being able to}} prepare information by March 3, and was even postponed by his own supporters in spite of configuring a report the next day (which consisted of a series of additional duties to meet the interest on the state debts).|$|E
5|$|With {{the public}} {{announcement}} in mid-February {{of the possible}} relocation of the team, Heisley and representatives for the Grizzlies {{set out on a}} road trip to consider several U.S. cities which wanted to have the franchise relocate to their city. Originally Heisley had until 1March <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NBA for a relocation, but the deadline was later extended to 26March. A similar deadline was also awarded to the Charlotte Hornets, who were also considering a relocation.|$|E

She {{used the money}} <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Iowa Writers Workshop and, after being accepted, to move from New York to Iowa City in 1967. There Godwin met her teacher and future mentor Kurt Vonnegut. At Iowa, Godwin worked as an instructor while earning an M.A. and Ph.D. from the same university in 1968 and 1971 respectively. She began teaching Greek Drama, before earning a position teaching literature. By age 30, Godwin had written three novels, {{but was unable to}} get any of them published.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{moved into}} an on-campus {{boarding}} house at 61 East Eleventh Avenue in the primarily black neighborhood of the University District in Columbus, and majored in architectural engineering. Brown attempted several times <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school's aviation program, but was denied {{because of his}} race. Brown joined the track and field team {{as well as the}} wrestling team, but soon dropped both for financial reasons. He {{took a job as a}} janitor at a local Lazarus department store and then was hired by the Pennsylvania Railroad to load boxcars from 15:30 to midnight each day. In spite of this, he maintained top grades in his classes. Facing difficulties with his academics and the institutional segregation in the city, Brown nevertheless found most of his fellow students were friendly toward him. Brown rarely returned to Mississippi during the school year, but in the summers he worked at a dry cleaner in Hattiesburg to help pay for his classes.|$|E
5|$|Since {{he did not}} post a {{lap time}} within 107% of the fastest time during Q1, Jenson Button was {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> race stewards {{to be allowed to}} the start the race; they granted him permission to do so. After qualifying, McLaren had to fit his car with a fifth heat motor generator unit (MGU-H) and a fifth turbo charger for the season. As this exceeded the limit of four units per power unit element, Button was later handed ten-place and five-place grid penalties. As he was already due to start {{from the back of the}} grid, the penalty was substituted with a drive-through penalty, to be served within the first three laps of the race.|$|E
25|$|The 1971 Act gave {{power to}} the fire {{authority}} <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> court to prohibit the use of premises if they were dangerous {{and there was a}} serious risk of imminent danger from fire for persons in the premises (prohibition notice). This prohibition power applied widely to all manner of premises but excluded single private dwellings. One of the changes introduced in 1987 was for the fire authority to issue prohibition notices directly, without the need <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> court.|$|E

50|$|At its founding, {{the school}} {{accepted}} only male students.

HBS took over administration of that program from Radcliffe in 1954. In 1959, alumnae of the one-year program (by then known as the Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration) were permitted <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> join <b>the</b> HBS MBA program as second-years. In December 1962, <b>the</b> faculty voted <b>to</b> allow women <b>to</b> enter <b>the</b> MBA program directly. <b>The</b> first women <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MBA program matriculated in September 1963.|$|R
