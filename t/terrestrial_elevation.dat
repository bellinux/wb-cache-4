40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{investigation}} of the subtleties in the process of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) development (in the boreal autumn) by taking advantage of a combination of satellite observations of the ocean and atmosphere such as TRMM satellite microwave imager (TMI) estimated SSTs, rain-rates and surface wind speeds. We supplement the above datasets with long-term SSTs, winds as well as OLR. Based on analysis of these satellite data, a conceptual model is presented that traces the origin of the development of SPCZ, critically, to the difference winds (winds of the present month minus that of the last month) that appear to be, at least in part, related to the thermal winds to the east of New Guinea in August. Along with the northerly difference winds, a decrease in velocity of the prevailing southeasterly wind could lead to a drop in evaporation at the sea surface, which, in turn, might cause an increase in SST and in low-level convergence {{in the vicinity of the}} SPCZ. The heat surplus, due to the less evaporation, produces the SST to rise at a rate of about 0. 05 - 0. 25 ~{!c~}C per week in the southwestern Pacific compared with its counterpart in the central Pacific in the course of SPCZ development. The SPCZ is especially intensified from October to November measured by an SPCZ index which is defined as the average rain rates (mm/h) along 10 ~{!c~}S between 150. 125 ~{!c~}E and 170. 125 ~{!c~}W. It appears that a cross-equatorial flow adjacent 145 ~{!c~}E in the western tropical Pacific occurs in advance of the substantial intensification of the SPCZ. This northerly cross-equatorial flow, which is certainly related to the seasonal adjustment of the Asian monsoon, deflects to the east after it comes to the Southern Hemisphere, e. g. close to the 10 ~{!c~}S, forced by the Coriolis effect to produce the northwesterly wind. In addition, influenced by the elevation of New Guinea, the northwesterly wind speeds up along the northwest-southeast trending mountains in New Guinea and encounters the prevailing southeasterly wind to the east of New Guinea, thus causing more intense convergence and more convective extended cloud belts and more rainfall. Therefore, the whole developing phase of the SPCZ can be divided into two stages. The mechanism of atmosphere-ocean interaction appears to contribute much to the earlier stage of the SPCZ development, while the second stage is marked by the interaction between the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere combined with the effect of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>elevation</b> and orientation, which is the underlying cause for the substantial intensification of the SPCZ [...] Pages: 1647 - 165...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{availability}} of airborne LiDAR data covering the most populated areas of Tasmania’s coastal zone has stimulated considerable interest in {{its potential for}} a range of applications including land use planning, ecosystem research, coastal development policy and building codes, emergency response planning, and communications, particularly given the heightened awareness of impending climate change and sea level rise impacts on the coastal zone. Acquired for the Climate Futures for Tasmania project, the data provides high accuracy, high resolution elevation measurement not previously available in broad-scale <b>terrestrial</b> <b>elevation</b> data. A stated vertical accuracy of ± 25 cm makes the data better suited to detailed assessments and decision making than alternative large area digital terrain datasets. However, the levels of accuracy stated in LiDAR data specifications usually apply to best-case vertical accuracy assessments for open, level terrain. Interference from above-ground features such as vegetation is known to reduce the reliability of LiDAR elevation measurements. In particular, low-lying, dense vegetation cover poses significant challenges for automated and semi-automated vegetation filters and elevation correction algorithms. Existing approaches to the separation of ground from above-ground LiDAR returns have not been universally successful due to the constraints of sensor system hardware capabilities, ineffective data filtering techniques, and the inability of laser pulses to fully penetrate closed canopy vegetation. The Climate Futures for Tasmania data provides evidence of the misclassification of laser returns due to sensor system and data processing limitations. The broad aims of this study were to apply ground truthing to quantify the influence of low saltmarsh vegetation on the quality of Climate Futures for Tasmania data, to investigate a method for separating ground and low vegetation returns to improve ground elevation estimation, and to construct digital elevation, canopy surface and canopy height models using separated ground and vegetation returns. Results from the study concluded that the classified point data and digital elevation model provided to the Climate Futures for Tasmania project contained statistically significant elevation errors for the areas tested. For vegetated terrain, strong linear relationships between surveyed and LiDAR elevations were not evident. The approach adopted to separate ground and vegetation returns was not effective in significantly improving the accuracy of digital elevation modelling over the saltmarsh platform. While vegetation-related elevation error was significant for each vegetation group assessed, no significant difference was detected between groups. The variability of vegetation height and structure within the marsh, combined with uncertainty in the geolocation of the LiDAR footprint, were identified as primary impediments to a more reliable assessment of vegetation influences on LiDAR accuracy. Upward bias in LiDAR ground elevation coupled with a reduction in vegetation height measurement due to laser infiltration of the upper canopy resulted in a significant underestimation of vegetation height...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSolid {{polar stratospheric cloud}} (PSC) layers {{observed}} by lidar and a balloon-borne optical particle counter (OPC) on 17 December 1995 are reexamined in a comparative analysis framework. The typical radius of solid particles in the observed PSC is determined through the comparative analysis to have been approximately 2. 3  μm. A backward trajectory analysis for the air mass in which the solid particles were observed shows that the air mass had experienced temperatures 2 – 3  K below the frost point of nitric acid tri-hydrate (NAT) during the 4 days preceding the observations. The back-trajectory analysis traces the air mass back to northern Greenland and Ellesmere Island on 16 December, one day before the observations. A microphysical box model is used to investigate possible mechanisms of formation for the observed solid particles. The results of this model suggest that the solid particles formed under mesoscale temperature fluctuations associated with mountain lee wave activity induced by the relatively high <b>terrestrial</b> <b>elevations</b> of northern Greenland and Ellesmere Island...|$|R

40|$|Mud volcanoes are {{frequently}} encountered geo-structures at active and passive continental margins. In contrast to magmatic volcanoes, mud volcanoes are marine or <b>terrestrial,</b> topographic <b>elevation</b> built from vertically rising fluidized mud or mud breccia. Commonly, these structures have a crater, hummocky rime and caldera. Mud volcanism is triggered by various geological processes {{which lead to}} a high pore fluid pressure at great depth, sediment instabilities and a subsequent discharge of mud, fluids and gases such as hydrocarbons (mostly the greenhouse gas methane). Although global estimates of methane emissions from mud volcanoes vary over two orders of magnitude, mud volcanism could be an important source for atmospheric methane. However, a substantial fraction of the hydrocarbons are retained in the mud volcanoes surface sediments. Here, the upwelled hydrocarbons fuel a variety of free-living and symbiotic, chemosynthetic communities that oxidize these with electron acceptors such as oxygen or sulphate from the water column or the atmosphere. The activity of the chemosynthetic communities is regulated by the availability of either electron donors (hydrocarbons) or acceptors which, in return, is determined by mass transport processes. Most important in this context are the magnitudes of upward advection of electron donors and the influx of electron acceptors due to diffusion and bioirrigation...|$|R
40|$|Perch height {{selection}} was studied in juvenile western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis) and sagebrush lizards (Sceloporus graciosus) {{in the field}} and in the laboratory. In nature juvenile S. occidentalis were more arboreal than were juvenile S. graciosus. In laboratory experiments with lab-reared 3 - 4 wk old lizards, S. occidentalis perched off the ground more frequently. Differences between these two species in habitat preference are inferred to be at least partly innate, and emerge at an early age. Within each species, juveniles from different field populations differed in habitat use in the wild: lizards were more <b>terrestrial</b> at higher <b>elevations.</b> However, lab-reared juveniles from different populations of each species did not differ in laboratory tests of perch selection. In S. occidentalis there was evidence of individual variation in perch selection in the laboratory, but no among-family variation was detected...|$|R
40|$|Bioturbation {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} to exhibit {{different forms of}} sediment mixing in aquatic systems, but few in situ tests have been conducted in estuaries, and anyone along a flooding gradient which is the main feature characterizing intertidal areas. The relationships between bioturbation and macroinvertebrate communities were studied {{as part of a}} restoration project in the tidal freshwater zone of the Schelde estuary, and highlighted specific sediment mixing patterns along a tidal gradient. Three permanent sites, evenly distributed along the flooding gradient, were monitored over a period of one year. Tidal influence engendered a clear gradient opposing newly-established aquatic communities (low elevation and strong disturbance) to remnant <b>terrestrial</b> communities (high <b>elevation</b> and low disturbance). Different bioturbative modes were identified along this gradient. Biodiffusion (random spreading of sediment particles) was the dominant mode at high and mid elevations. Low elevation was characterized by bioadvection (vertical movement of sediment particles) and higher bioturbative intensities. Maximum bioturbative intensities were observed in summer. This is the first bioturbation study, conducted along a flooding gradient, and which characterizes the bioturbative modes and intensities among tidal habitats and confirms the key role of disturbance. These findings underline the significance of the multiplicity of bioturbation modes in estuarine habitats, and the potential implications in estuarine biogeochemistry in general...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Elevational {{biodiversity}} {{patterns are}} understudied in high-latitude aquatic systems, {{even though these}} systems are important for detecting very early impacts of climatic changes on Earth. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the elevational trends in species richness and local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) of three biofilm microbial groups in freshwater ponds and to identify the key mechanisms underlying these patterns. Location: One hundred and forty-six ponds in subarctic Finland and Norway distributed across the tree line along an elevational gradient of 10 - 1, 038 m a. s. l., spanning from forested landscape to barren boulder fields. Time period: July-August 2015. Major taxa studied: Diatoms, cyanobacteria and non-cyanobacteria. Methods: Generalized linear models were used to identify the most important pond variables explaining richness and LCBD. Structural equation models were used to explore the direct and indirect effects of multiscale drivers on richness and LCBD. Results: Diatom and cyanobacteria richness showed unimodal elevational patterns, whereas non-cyanobacteria richness decreased with increasing elevation. The LCBD-elevation relationship was U-shaped for all three microbial groups. Diatom and cyanobacteria richness and LCBD were best explained by local pond variables, especially by pH. Non-cyanobacteria richness and LCBD were related to pond variables, elevation as a proxy for climatic conditions, and normalized difference vegetation index as a proxy for terrestrial productivity. Main conclusions: Aquatic autotrophs were primarily controlled by environmental filtering, whereas heterotrophic bacteria were also affected by <b>terrestrial</b> productivity and <b>elevation.</b> All studied aspects of microbial diversity were directly or indirectly linked to elevation; therefore, climatic changes may greatly alter aquatic microbial assemblages...|$|R
40|$|The {{mission of}} the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Commission (SMBRC) is to restore and enhance the Santa Monica Bay (Bay) through actions and {{partnerships}} that improve water quality, conserve and rehabilitate natural resources, and protect the Bay???s benefits and values. The SMBRC is charged with implementing the Bay Restoration Plan, a stakeholder-developed plan that describes goals, objectives, and milestones to address the environmental problems facing the Bay and the Bay???s watersheds. Scientific monitoring of the Bay???s natural resources and restoring coastal wetlands are important parts of the Bay Restoration Plan. In September 2011, the SMBRC completed {{the second year of}} baseline assessment surveys at the Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve (BWER). The comprehensive surveys were developed in partnership with the California Department of Fish and Game and the California State Coastal Conservancy to assess the condition of the BWER and inform the state???s wetlands restoration planning. The surveys incorporated monitoring and assessment of biological, chemical, and physical components of the BWER ecosystem. Vegetation, seed core, <b>terrestrial</b> invertebrate, and <b>elevation</b> surveys were conducted on permanent transects randomly located throughout all habitat types at the BWER. Additional biological data collected included surveys for small and large mammals, vertebrate mortality along roads, herpetofauna, ichthyofauna, benthic invertebrates, birds, and submerged aquatic vegetation (Table 1). Water quality data collected included dissolved metals, fecal indicator bacteria, nutrients, and additional parameters. Sediment quality data included trace metals, amphipod toxicity, grain size, and total organic carbon. This document provides a summary of the data collected during the second year of the Baseline Assessment Program (BAP) survey of the BWER...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{analysis}} {{of material and}} energy exchange between the marine and terrestrial components of island ecosystems enables research into the impact of human population and land use {{on the health of}} coral reef habitat. Satellite and acoustic remote sensing technologies enable the collection of data to produce high resolution bathymetry for integration with <b>terrestrial</b> digital <b>elevation</b> models (DEMs) into coastal terrain models. An integrated terrain surface that incorporates the land-sea interface, grounded by a geographic information system, is a powerful analytical tool for geomorphic studies of watersheds and coastal processes. The island of Tutuila, American Samoa is an ideal case study due to its high relief terrain, data availability and local interest in impacts to coral reef resources. The Tutuila model integrates a USGS DEM, multibeam bathymetry from 15 to 500 m and near shore bathymetric data from 0 to 15 m derived from IKONOS satellite imagery. The high spatial resolution of IKONOS imagery is suitable for detection of features with subtle relief and intricate structure. Shallow water bathymetry is derived by quantifying the relative attenuation of blue and green spectral band radiance as a function of depth. The procedure used to derive bathymetry, Lyzenga (1985), is identified as the most effective of several proposed in the recent literature. The product is error-checked using control points extracted from multibeam sonar data and collected during recent field surveys, as well as terrain profiles. The coastal terrain model provides morphological detail of fine resolution and high accuracy for terrain and land use analysis to enhance the study of ecosystem interconnectivity and the effects of anthropogenic inputs to coral reef habitats. Subsequent topographic analyses of the Tutuila model use drainage patterns to identify contiguous marine/terrestrial basins within which the marine environment is most directly impacted by land use through freshwater inputs from affiliated catchments. Human population density serves as an indicator of intensified land use and urbanization, which has been shown to increase pathogen and sediment loads in runoff, while percent coral cover, coral colony density and coral genera diversity are used as indicators of reef health. Spatiotemporal correlation analyses of population density against the three reef health indices within each of the marine/terrestrial basins reveal a decline in reef health associated with increased population density. This paper integrates and builds upon established methods of satellite imagery analysis and terrain modeling to create the Tutuila coastal terrain model and uses it to refine the scale of other studies linking human terrestrial activities to the physical condition of coral reefs...|$|R
40|$|I {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} microhabitat use and behavioral thermoregulation in the lizards Sceloporus occidentalis and S. graciosus. I studied two populations of each species along a 1300 —m elevational gradient in the San Gabriel Mountains of southern California. These species occupy different, but overlapping, elevational ranges, with S. graciosus occurring at higher elevations. Because their ranges differ, the species experience different thermal environments; however, they are nearly identical in several measures of thermal physiology. Body temperatures of active lizards varied little with altitude, although air temperatures decrease substantially over this range. Both species compensated behaviorally for variation in thermal environments by varying basking frequency and microhabitat use. By thermoregulating, lizards maintained body temperatures that favor high levels of locomotor performance and other physiological functions. Microhabitat use varied markedly with elevation. Sceloporus occidentalis was almost completely arboreal at low elevation; lizards of both species were partly arboreal, partly terrestrial at intermediate elevation; and S. graciosus was mainly <b>terrestrial</b> at high <b>elevations.</b> Thus, the species converged in microhabitat use where sympatric. These shifts in microhabitat use paralleled altitudinal changes in (i) the spatial location of thermally suitable microhabitats and (ii) habitat structure. Behavioral thermoregulation, then, {{appears to be an}} important determinant of habitat use in these lizards. Results of this study may have important implications for lizard community ecology. Microhabitats that are otherwise appropriate for lizards can be thermally unsuitable depending on the local thermal environment. Hence, the thermal environment and lizard thermal biology constrain patterns of structural habitat use. As a result, physiological considerations could limit the behavioral and evolutionary options for species experiencing interspecific competition. For example, competitors in sympatry may be unable to evolve microhabitat resource partitioning because only a subset of microhabitats are thermally suitable...|$|R
