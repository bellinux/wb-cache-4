Menem, who was running for a third term as president, supported the vote condemning Cuba and the military aid to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Derek Fisher succeeded Ewing as NBPA {{president}} in 2006. In early 2011, negotiations {{on a new}} CBA began. The league claimed that it was losing $300 million a year (22 out of 30 teams were losing money last season) and proposed to reduce 40% of players' salary (about $800 million) and institute a hard salary cap (at $45 million per team) {{as opposed to a}} soft cap (at $58 million) currently in use. The union disputed those figures and steadfastly opposed <b>those</b> <b>changes.</b> Hunter said that he was advising players to prepare for a lockout. In May 2011, the NBPA {{filed a complaint with the}} National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), accusing the league of negotiating in bad faith by failing to provide critical financial data to the union and repeatedly threatening to lock out players. The NBA quickly rejected the complaint, saying that the league complies fully with federal labor laws. The union also considered the option of decertification, which allows players to file an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA.|$|E

5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make <b>those</b> <b>changes.</b> For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.|$|E
5|$|In December 1996, Patton {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to consider the}} issue of worker's compensation reform. Both Patton and the state's legislators believed that the generous benefits provided under Kentucky state law created an unfavorable business climate in the state. The reform measures adopted in the special session included a substantial reduction in benefits, including those to coal miners who developed black lung disease. Patton's support of this measure alienated labor leaders, especially in eastern Kentucky's coal mining communities – which had previously been among his strongest supporters. As the law began to take effect, Patton himself agreed that it had gone too far, and his Secretary of Labor worked with representatives from organized labor to draft changes in the law. <b>Those</b> <b>changes</b> were eventually made in the 2002 legislative session.|$|E
5|$|Stewie rams a toy {{spaceship}} into Peter's ear, annoying him, so Peter throws Rupert {{into the}} basement. Stewie follows the bear, discovering an old television script that Brian wrote entitled What I Learned on Jefferson Street. Stewie tosses the script onto the kitchen table, prompting Lois to question {{what it is}} about. Brian suggests she read it and tell him what she thinks. Lois {{falls in love with}} it, and suggests he meet with network executives about producing the show. When Brian pitches it to CBS, the executives respond positively. While the initial casting session goes well, with Elijah Wood auditioning for the lead, the producers assigned by the executives also bring in James Woods, who performs the role in a more comedic fashion, winning over the executives. Brian's serious drama is turned into a sitcom, bringing in a live studio audience as well as a chimpanzee, and renaming it Class Holes. When Brian objects to the changes, the producers remind him of what he had tried to achieve for many years—his own television show—and threaten him with unemployment if he objects to <b>those</b> <b>changes.</b> Disappointed that Brian allowed the executives to change his show so dramatically, Lois demands that he stand up for himself and object to everything James Woods changed about the show. The producers, however, do not take kindly to Brian's desire to start over, so Brian quits in frustration. Brian reveals his disappointment that he no longer has his own television show, but Lois convinces him that it is his integrity that matters. Peter interrupts, with his own show appearing on the screen, entitled Bigger Jaws.|$|E

Particularly, when a project is fast-tracked without properplanning, <b>those</b> <b>change</b> iterations {{can cause the}} disruption of the construction process. For this reason,to effectively handle fast-tracking change iterations involved in fast-tracking need to be identified, andthe dynamic behavior of construction resulting from <b>those</b> <b>change</b> iterations {{must be dealt with}} in asystematic manner. As an effort to address some of these challenging issues in fast-trackingconstruction, this research paper identifies different change iteration cycles involved in fast-trackingconstruction and observes the characteristics and behavior patterns of change. All of research findingsare incorporated into a cohesive system dynamics model and the model simulation confirms thatmanagerial decisions on change or rework should be made based on the proper assessment of theirtradeoff. In addition, a case study of highway and bridge construction projects shows the potential ofhow fast-tracking construction can benefit from dynamic change management in real world settings...|$|R

30|$|There {{are three}} main types of version files’ storage, i.e., full storage, {{incremental}} storage, and differential storage. The full storage {{is the starting}} point for all other storages and contains all the data in a file that are selected to be stored.

For example, if a full storage was done by node 1, node 2 stores all the changed data of the file after node 1 by the incremental storage. Likewise, node 3 only copies <b>those</b> <b>changed</b> data in the file after node 2 ’s incremental storage. The differential storage copies <b>those</b> <b>changed</b> data in the file since the last full storage took place.
