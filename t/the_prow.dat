5|$|The {{final version}} of Youth and Pleasure was painted between 1830 and 1832, but Etty had been contemplating a {{painting}} on the theme since 1818–19. In 1822 he had exhibited an early version at the British Institution titled A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes (Youth on the Prow); in this version the group of figures on <b>the</b> <b>prow</b> is reversed, and the swimmers around the boat are absent. Another rough version of the painting also survives, similar to the 1832 version but again with the figures on <b>the</b> <b>prow</b> reversed. This version was exhibited at a retrospective of Etty's work at the Society of Arts in 1849; it is dated 1848 but {{this is likely to}} be a misprint of 1828, making it a preliminary study for the 1832 painting.|$|E
5|$|When Etty {{exhibited}} {{the completed painting}} at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1832, it was shown untitled, with the relevant six lines from The Bard attached; writers at the time sometimes referred to it by its incipit of Fair Laughs the Morn. By the time of Etty's death in 1849, it had acquired its present title of Youth on <b>the</b> <b>Prow,</b> and Pleasure at the Helm.|$|E
5|$|Needled by {{repeated}} {{attacks from}} the press on his supposed indecency, poor taste and lack of creativity, Etty changed his approach after the response to Youth on <b>the</b> <b>Prow,</b> and Pleasure at the Helm. He exhibited over 80 further paintings at the Royal Academy alone, and remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from this time made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons. He died in November 1849 and, while his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity, interest in him declined over time, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century all of his paintings had fallen below their original prices.|$|E

5|$|The 1832 {{exhibition}} of Youth on <b>the</b> <b>Prow,</b> and Pleasure at the Helm, a painting containing apparently gratuitous nude figures, met a hostile reception from critics. From then on, while Etty continued to paint nude {{figures for the}} rest of his career, he made a conscious effort to try to illustrate moral lessons with his work. This effort was not wholly successful, and he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some throughout his career. He died in late 1849, and following his death nude paintings went rapidly out of fashion in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was bought in 1832 by Robert Vernon to {{form part of}} his collection of British art. Vernon donated his collection, including Youth on <b>the</b> <b>Prow,</b> and Pleasure at the Helm, to the National Gallery in 1847, which, in turn, transferred it to the Tate Gallery in 1949. It remains one of Etty's best-known works, and formed part of major exhibitions at Tate Britain in 2001–02 and at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12.|$|E
5|$|Youth on <b>the</b> <b>Prow,</b> and Pleasure at the Helm was {{inspired}} by a passage in Thomas Gray's poem The Bard. The theme of The Bard was the English king Edward I's conquest of Wales, and a curse placed by a Welsh bard upon Edward's descendants after he ordered the execution of all bards and the eradication of Welsh culture. Etty used a passage Gray intended to symbolise the seemingly bright start to the disastrous reign of Edward's great-great-grandson Richard II.|$|E

5|$|Youth on <b>the</b> <b>Prow,</b> and Pleasure at the Helm (also {{known as}} Fair Laughs the Morn and Youth and Pleasure) is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1832 and currently in Tate Britain. Etty {{had been planning}} the painting since 1818–19, and an early version was exhibited in 1822. The piece {{was inspired by a}} metaphor in Thomas Gray's poem The Bard in which the apparently bright start to the notorious misrule of Richard II of England was compared to a gilded ship whose occupants are unaware of an approaching storm. Etty chose to illustrate Gray's lines literally, depicting a golden boat filled with and surrounded by nude and near-nude figures.|$|E
5|$|Class II {{stones are}} {{carefully}} shaped slabs dating after {{the arrival of}} Christianity in the eighth and ninth centuries, with a cross on one face and {{a wide range of}} symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I stones, they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Good examples include Glamis 2, which contains a finely executed Celtic cross on the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in <b>the</b> <b>prow.</b> Class III stones are thought to overlap chronologically with Class II stones. Most are elaborately shaped and incised cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes, but lacking idiomatic Pictish symbols. They are widely distributed but predominate in the southern Pictish areas.|$|E
5|$|About 250 Pictish stones {{survive and}} have been {{assigned}} by scholars to three classes. Class I stones are those thought to date to the period up to the 7th century and are the most numerous group. The stones are largely unshaped and include incised symbols of animals including fish and the Pictish beast, everyday objects such as mirrors, combs and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including V-rod, double disc and Z-rod. They are found between from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. The greatest concentrations are in Sutherland, around modern Inverness and Aberdeen. Good examples include the Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno stones (Angus). Class II stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the 8th and 9th centuries, with a cross on one face and {{a wide range of}} symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I stones, they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Good examples include Glamis 2, which contains a finely executed Celtic cross on the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in <b>the</b> <b>prow.</b> Class III stones are thought to overlap chronologically with Class II stones.

6000|$|The {{recklessness}} of this consisted in {{the fact}} that his vessel was not a [...] "ram," [...] but built of comparatively thin plates. The necessity for it lay in the certainty that a few minutes more would enable <b>the</b> <b>prows</b> to gain shallow water and escape.|$|R
25|$|In 29 BC Augustus {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of another Rostra {{in front of the}} Temple of Caesar, {{at the opposite end of}} the Forum Iulium from Caesar's Rostra. This was used as a tribunal and was adorned with <b>the</b> <b>prows</b> of galleys captured at the Battle of Actium.|$|R

5|$|The dromons that Procopius {{describes}} were single-banked {{ships of}} probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side. Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an outrigger (parexeiresia), these extended {{directly from the}} hull. In the later bireme dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks (elasiai) were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the marines in boarding operations. Makrypoulias suggests 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers. The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters. Although most contemporary vessels had a single mast (histos or katartion), the larger bireme dromons probably needed at least two masts in order to manoeuvre effectively, assuming that a single lateen sail for a ship this size would have reached unmanageable dimensions. The ship was steered by means of two quarter rudders at the stern (prymnē), which also housed a tent (skēnē) that covered the captain's berth (krab(b)at(t)os). <b>The</b> <b>prow</b> (prōra) featured an elevated forecastle (pseudopation), below which the siphon for the discharge of Greek fire projected, although secondary siphons could also be carried amidships on either side. A pavesade (kastellōma), on which marines could hang their shields, ran around {{the sides of the}} ship, providing protection to the deck crew. Larger ships also had wooden castles (xylokastra) on either side between the masts, similar to those attested for the Roman liburnians, providing archers with elevated firing platforms. The bow spur (peronion) was intended to ride over an enemy ship's oars, breaking them and rendering it helpless against missile fire and boarding actions.|$|E

25|$|The {{superstructure}} {{appears to}} have been made with a main section amidships, a heavy building at the stern and a smaller one at <b>the</b> <b>prow.</b> Although nothing remains of the stern and prow buildings their existence is indicated by the shorter spacing of the decks supporting cross beams and distribution of ballast. The arrangement of the seconda nave superstructures is comparable to that of the shrines depicted on an Isian lamp held by the Museum of Ostia. If not coincidental, this is further evidence of Isis worship rather than Diana.|$|E
25|$|The Romans {{recognized}} their {{weakness in}} naval power and tactics, {{especially after the}} incident of the Lipari Islands. With this in mind they constructed the corvus, a plank to link ships together at sea. The inventor of the corvus is unknown, {{but it could have}} been a Syracusan, such as Archimedes. This device would be attached to <b>the</b> <b>prow</b> of Roman ships on a rotating axle, so that it could be swung around; and its spiked end could then be dropped onto an enemy ship. In this way the Romans could still make use of their superior soldiers by loading them across the corvus and onto enemy ships.|$|E
25|$|Between 8 and 9 {{o'clock at}} night the {{flotilla}} closed in at the carrack's stern, where {{only one of the}} two chase guns could be used to fend off the attack since the other had been moved to <b>the</b> <b>prow</b> to protect the ship's cables. A Japanese Christian captain led the charge, rallying his fellow coreligionists with the reasoning that if the carrack was not destroyed or captured, Ieyasu would turn his wrath onto the Christian community and the churches would be destroyed. A few Japanese succeeded in boarding the ship but were promptly cut down (Pessoa himself apparently killed two) or were forced to jump into the water.|$|E
50|$|As usual, Duarte Pacheco {{was aware}} of all these preparations, and had himself taken counter-measures.
