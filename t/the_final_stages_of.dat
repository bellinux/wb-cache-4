5|$|Achebe's first central female {{character}} in a novel is Beatrice Nwanyibuife in Anthills of the Savannah. As an independent woman in the city, Beatrice strives for the balance that Okonkwo lacked so severely. She refutes the notion that she needs a man, and slowly learns about Idemili, a goddess balancing the aggression of male power. Although <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother-type role, Beatrice remains firm in her conviction that women should {{not be limited to}} such capacities.|$|E
5|$|By 1947, when John Crichton-Stuart, {{the fifth}} marquess, {{inherited}} the castle, the Bute family had divested itself {{of most of}} its land in South Wales. John sold off the family's remaining property interests and in 1950 he gave Caerphilly Castle to the state. The lakes were re-flooded and <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the restoration work were completed in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 21st century the castle is managed by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw as a tourist attraction. In 2006, the castle saw 90,914 visitors.

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> development, {{hitherto}} unknown {{information contained}} within undamaged DNA {{would be enough}} to bring others back from the dead including their memories and personality. This would be done by taking a small sample from someone's body and preserving it at the time when the level of the brain's efficiency and knowledge is highest. On the day of death, a cell would be taken from the sample for the cloning to take place, and the memories and personality would be restored to their peak level.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> {{end-of-life}} care, midazolam {{is routinely}} used at low doses via subcutaneous injection {{to help with}} agitation, myoclonus, restlessness or anxiety in the last hours or days of life. At higher doses during the last weeks of life, midazolam is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when {{it is necessary to}} alleviate intolerable suffering not responsive to other treatments, but the need for this is rare.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} stage {{the aim is to}} reduce PD {{symptoms}} while controlling fluctuations in the effect of the medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed. When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, deep brain stimulation, subcutaneous waking day apomorphine infusion and enteral dopa pumps can be of use. The third stage presents many challenging problems requiring a variety of treatments for psychiatric symptoms, orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction, etc. In <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> the disease, palliative care is provided to improve quality of life.|$|E
