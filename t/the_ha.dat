5|$|The Cuu Long {{conference held}} between 6 and 10 October {{was the first}} provincial-level conference to be held. By 22 October, 21 provinces had held provincial-level party conferences. The central party {{leadership}} faced less criticism on the draft Political Report and socio-economic policies from the provincial-level conferences than by district-level conferences. The provincial-level conferences criticized central policies less and were evasive about critical issues. However, the provincial-level conferences were not completely dormant and scored some minor victories, such as reducing the average age needed to join an executive committee and they adopted a more flexible and efficient mode of planning and organization. As during the district-level conferences, there were certain convocations which attracted attention; the An Giang Party Committee criticized past economic performance, while <b>the</b> <b>Ha</b> Son Binh Congress criticized the irrational management of provincial economic affairs. While these committees criticized past policies or well-known deficiencies, none of them criticized {{the policies of the}} central party leadership.|$|E
25|$|Two {{different}} {{oral traditions}} explain {{the use of}} the nose for playing the `ohe hano ihu. According to one, the `ohe hano ihu is played with air from the nose rather than from the mouth because a person's hā, breath, is expressive of the person's inner being. As <b>the</b> <b>hā</b> travels from the na`ao, or gut, through the mouth, <b>the</b> <b>hā</b> can be used to lie. When <b>the</b> <b>hā</b> travels through the nose, it cannot lie. Therefore, if a young man loves a woman, that love will be expressed in the music he plays with his `ohe hano ihu. According to the other tradition, the instrument is played with the nose to enable the player to softly sing or chant while playing.|$|E

25|$|During {{the era of}} the Northern and Southern Courts, the tantō were forged to be up {{to forty}} centimeters as opposed to the normal one shaku (about thirty centimeters) length. The blades became thinner between the uri and the omote, and wider between <b>the</b> <b>ha</b> and mune. At this point in time, two styles of hamon were prevalent: the older style, which was subtle and artistic, and the newer, more popular style. With the {{beginning}} of the Muromachi period, constant fighting caused the mass production of blades, meaning that with higher demand, lower-quality blades were manufactured. Blades that were custom-forged still were of exceptional quality, but the average blade suffered greatly. As the end of the period neared, the average blade narrowed and the curvature shallowed.|$|E

25|$|Bai Tho Mountain is a {{limestone}} mountain formation, which {{rises to}} {{a height of}} 106 meters, {{right in the middle}} of <b>the</b> <b>Hạ</b> Long City.

It has historical linkage to the visit of Emperor Lê Thánh Tông to the provincial city in 1468. The emperor was moved by the beauty of the mountain covered with clouds, called it a young fairy of Hạ Long and got a poem written on it and engraved on the southern side of the rocky cliff. In 1729, Lord Trịnh Cương did a painting and poem on Emperor Lê Thánh Tông on this mountain.|$|E
25|$|Hyaluronic acid (HA) is {{a widely}} used {{biomaterial}} {{as a result of}} its excellent biocompatibility and its physiologic function diversity. It is abundant in the extracellular matrix (ECM) where it binds large glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans through specific HA-protein interactions. HA also binds cell surface receptors such as CD44, which results in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades that regulate cell adhesion and motility and promote proliferation and differentiation. HA is also known to support angiogenesis because its degradation products stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Thus, HA plays a pivotal role in maintaining the normal processes necessary for tissue survival. Unmodified HA has been used in clinical applications such as ocular surgery, wound healing, and plastic surgery. HA can be crosslinked to form hydrogels. HA hydrogels that were either unmodified or modified with laminin were implanted into an adult central nervous system lesion and tested for their ability to induce neural tissue formation in a study by Hou et al.. They demonstrated the ability to support cell ingrowth and angiogenesis, in addition to inhibiting glial scar formation. Also, <b>the</b> <b>HA</b> hydrogels modified with laminin were able to promote neurite extension. These results support HA gels as a promising biomaterial for a nerve guidance conduit.|$|E
