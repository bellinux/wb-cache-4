5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster has cheek pouches, {{which are}} an {{extension}} of the mouth, extending from the mouth {{all the way to the}} rear legs. Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of the pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the pouch is full, it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the cheek pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sunflower seed. When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E
5|$|Ceres, the {{asteroid}} belt's only dwarf planet, is about 950km in diameter, whereas 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, and 10 Hygiea have mean diameters {{of less than}} 600km. The remaining bodies range down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dust particle. The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it without incident. Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids do occur, and these can produce an asteroid family whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. Individual asteroids within {{the asteroid}} belt are categorized by their spectra, with most falling into three basic groups: carbonaceous (C-type), silicate (S-type), and metal-rich (M-type).|$|E
5|$|The USB {{standard}} specifies relatively loose tolerances for compliant USB connectors {{to minimize}} physical incompatibilities in connectors from different vendors. To address a weakness present {{in some other}} connector standards, the USB specification also defines limits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> connecting device {{in the area around}} its plug. This was done to prevent a device from blocking adjacent ports due {{to the size of the}} cable strain relief mechanism (usually molding integral with the cable outer insulation) at the connector. Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable that does.|$|E
40|$|Scaling can {{be defined}} as the {{adjustment}} of a structure, a function, or an organ <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mammalian body. An example is <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. The duration of the PR interval on the electrocardiogram (atrioventricular delay) in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart is a perplexing example of scaling. During evolution, mammalian species changed their shape, size, and function while adapting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> habitat in which they had to live and survive. This review deals with the problem of the apparent mismatch in scaling of the atrioventricular delay (PR interval) in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mammalian heart from mouse to whale...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{calculated}} the two-dimensional Fourier spectrum of a Landolt C. For Landolt Cs of orthogonal orientation, the main {{differences in the}} amplitude spectrum were found at a low frequency such that 1. 3 periods were equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Landolt C, {{rather than at the}} high frequency corresponding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gap, i. e., such that 2. 5 periods were equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Landolt C. We compared visual acuity assessments obtained with Landolt C optotypes and the cut-off of the contrast sensitivity function measured with sinusoidal gratings. We found that <b>the</b> frequency corresponding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gap is twice the latter frequency. We suggest that, in fact, this lower frequency can be used <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> position of the gap...|$|R
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} is very thin {{compared}} to its lateral dimensions. If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> watermelon (~1ft/30cm), the lipid bilayer {{making up the}} plasma membrane would be about as thick {{as a piece of}} office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized {{over the past several decades}} with x-ray reflectometry, neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} hunts almost entirely at night, {{watching}} from a perch before dropping or gliding silently {{down to its}} victim, but very occasionally it will hunt in daylight when it has young to feed. This species takes {{a wide range of}} prey, mainly woodland rodents, but also other mammals up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young rabbit, and birds, earthworms and beetles. In urban areas, birds make up a larger proportion of the diet, and species as unlikely as mallard and kittiwake have been killed and eaten.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle hunts mainly aquatic animals, such as fish, turtles and sea snakes, but {{it takes}} birds, such as little penguins, Eurasian coots and shearwaters, and mammals (including flying foxes) as well. In the Bismarck Archipelago it has been {{reported}} feeding on two species of possum, the northern common cuscus and common spotted cuscus. It is a skilled hunter, and will attack prey up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> swan. They also feed on carrion such as dead sheep, birds and fish found along the waterline, as well as raiding fishing nets and following cane harvesters.|$|E

5|$|Like all azhdarchid pterosaurs, Hatzegopteryx was {{probably}} a terrestrially foraging generalist predator. It is significantly larger than any other terrestrial predator from Maastrichtian Europe; due to its large size in an environment otherwise dominated by island dwarf dinosaurs, with no large hypercarnivorous theropods in the region, {{it has been suggested}} that Hatzegopteryx played the role of an apex predator in the Haţeg Island ecosystem. The robust anatomy of Hatzegopteryx suggests that it may have tackled larger prey than other azhdarchids, including animals too large to swallow whole; similarly, some modern storks (particularly the marabou stork and the jabiru) are known to attack and kill large prey such as flamingoes, and occasionally children, with their beaks. Meanwhile, other giant azhdarchids like Arambourgiania would probably have instead fed on small prey (up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human), including hatchling or small dinosaurs and eggs. Another pterosaur, Thalassodromeus, has similarly been suggested to be raptorial.|$|E
5|$|One of Duigan's most {{significant}} changes {{resulted in the}} downsizing of the Territorial Force (TF), which was already {{in a state of}} decline. Current recruitment was insufficient to support the theoretical infantry division and three mounted rifle brigades that the TF mobilisation plans called for. Duigan downsized the division to a brigade group and three lots of fortress troops centred around Auckland, Wellington, and Lyttelton. Many infantry regiments were disbanded and reconstituted as battalions, while the mounted regiments were each reduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> squadron. Several senior officers were placed in retirement as well. The morale of the TF declined as the remaining senior officers raised concerns—disregarded by Duigan—over the state of the army. Four TF colonels publicly protested the reforms in the press in {{what became known as the}} Four Colonels' Revolt. This was a breach of military regulations, which prohibited military personnel from communicating with journalists unless they had permission to do so. Instead of a court-martial, which he feared would generate public sympathy for the colonels, Duigan placed all four officers on the retired list as punishment. The revolt did result in greater public awareness of the poor state of New Zealand's military but little was done to rectify the situation.|$|E
5|$|The sky-cycle airship {{continued}} {{to climb to}} about two thousand feet and then traveled north using the East River as a landmark and went to East Sixtieth Street. The reporter then steered the sky-cycle to One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Street. There he crossed the East River again and then hovered over Greenpoint. The reporter flew the sky-cycle until almost dark and landed safely at the property of P. B. Gupther in Yonkers. Gupther helped the reporter deflate the balloon and pack the airship down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flat carpet bag. He then drove the reporter with his sky-cycle airship to the railroad station {{so he could get}} back to his place of origin.|$|E

Four stands (two at each terminal is size code D (large {{enough for an}} Airbus A330 or a Boeing 757), while 20 are for size category C (large enough for an Airbus A320 or Boeing 737). Domestic jets normally use the seven jetbridge stands (gates 30–37), while the five non-bridged gates at Terminal A (gates 25–29) are used for domestic regional aircraft. International flights all use the eight non-bridged gates at Terminal B (gates 42-49).

5|$|Upon creation, the 766th Unit was {{designed}} to vary in size, consisting {{of a number of}} smaller units capable of acting alone. Eventually, it was reinforced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> full regiment, with 3,000 men equally distributed across six battalions (numbered 1st through 6th). It was made directly subordinate to the KPA Army headquarters and put under the command of Senior Colonel Oh Jin Woo, who would command the unit for its entire existence. All 500 men of the 3rd Battalion were lost just before the war started when their transport was sunk while attacking Pusan harbor by the Republic of Korea Navy. For the remainder of its existence the regiment was whittled down by losses until it numbered no more than 1,500 men and could not muster more than three battalions.|$|E
