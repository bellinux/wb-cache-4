5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>Crucible</b> O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Marcus Campbell in {{the last}} 32, Ali Carter {{in the last}} 16, Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals. He reached the final without falling behind even once, and defeated Barry Hawkins 18–12 to win his fifth world title. O'Sullivan's break of 103 in the 15th frame was his 128th century break at <b>the</b> <b>Crucible</b> Theatre, breaking Stephen Hendry's record of 127 Crucible centuries. During the final he extended the record to 131 century breaks. O'Sullivan became the only player to score six century breaks in a World Championship final.

5|$|Sheffield has {{two large}} theatres, the Lyceum Theatre and <b>the</b> <b>Crucible</b> Theatre, which {{together}} with the smaller Studio Theatre make up the largest theatre complex outside London, located in Tudor Square. <b>The</b> <b>Crucible</b> Theatre is the home (since 1977) of the World Snooker Championships and hosts many well-known stage productions throughout the year. The Lyceum, which opened in 1897, serves as a venue for touring West End productions and operas by Opera North, as well as locally produced shows. Sheffield also has the Montgomery Theatre, a small 420 seater theatre located {{a short distance from}} Tudor Square, opposite the town hall on Surrey Street.

40|$|Fifty {{crucible}} {{fragments and}} 10 {{fragments of the}} melting furnace of the forest glassworks of Südel (1723 – 1741, Ct. Luzern), were analyzed by petrographic, mineralogical and chemical techniques {{in order to assess}} the temperature reached in the melting chamber and to find out which raw materials were used to make <b>the</b> <b>crucibles</b> and <b>the</b> melting furnace. Since <b>the</b> <b>crucibles</b> were used in the melting furnace, the temperature estimations were based on both <b>the</b> <b>crucibles</b> and <b>the</b> refractory fragments, as they were parts of the same system. The temperature range in the melting chamber, estimated by the structural order of the new-formed cristobalite, points to a temperature range between 1350 and 1500 °C. However, three crucible samples recorded extreme temperatures as high as 1650 °C, suggesting very high flame temperatures for wood fuel. The analyzed red bricks were made with local calcium-poor clay. One of them was tempered with refractory fragments, demonstrating an in-house production and the recycling of such a material after its use. <b>The</b> <b>crucibles</b> and <b>the</b> refractory bricks were made with the same refractory clay. The former using unprocessed clay and the latter blending clay with chamotte. A comparison with Sidérolithique clayey sand samples from the Swiss Jura, shows strong affinities which may rule out the archaeological hypothesis of an exclusive provenance of such clays from Germany, suggesting an import from the Swiss Jura mountains...|$|R

5|$|Using {{an alcohol}} lamp, Wöhler heated {{alternating}} layers of beryllium chloride and potassium in a wired-shut platinum crucible. The above reaction immediately took place and caused <b>the</b> <b>crucible</b> to become white hot. Upon cooling and washing the resulting gray-black powder {{he saw that}} it was made of fine particles with a dark metallic luster. The highly reactive potassium had been produced by the electrolysis of its compounds, a process discovered 21 years before. The chemical method using potassium yielded only small grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or hammered.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England, Sheffield Castle {{was built to}} control the Saxon {{settlements}} and Sheffield developed into a small town, no larger than Sheffield City Centre. By the 14th century Sheffield was noted {{for the production of}} knives, and by 1600, overseen by the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire, it had become the second centre of cutlery production in England after London. In the 1740s <b>the</b> <b>crucible</b> steel process was improved by Sheffield resident Benjamin Huntsman, allowing a much better production quality. At about the same time, Sheffield plate, a form of silver plating, was invented. The associated industries led to the rapid growth of Sheffield; the town was incorporated as a borough in 1843 and granted a city charter in 1893.|$|E
40|$|Abstract.

The better crystalline quality {{was obtained from the}} crystal grown in TaC-coated <b>crucible.</b> <b>The</b> SiC crystal grown in <b>the</b> TaC-coated <b>crucible</b> exhibited superior characteristics than SiC crystal grown in <b>the</b> conventional <b>crucible</b> in terms of the crystal quality and defect density.

40|$|Abstract: Sublimation {{growth of}} AlN on the SiC {{substrate}} {{was carried out}} using <b>the</b> graphite <b>crucible.</b> <b>The</b> single crystal AlN could be grown by placing the Ta sheet in <b>the</b> graphite <b>crucible.</b> However, if <b>the</b> Ta sheet was not placed, AlN could not be achieved and only the graphite layer was formed on the SiC substrate. It was confirmed by XPS that Ta combined with C and changed to TaC after the crystal growth. Since Ta acted as a carbon getter during the sublimation growth, single crystal AlN was achieved in <b>the</b> graphite <b>crucible</b> without graphitization of the substrate...|$|R
40|$|Nitride bonded {{silicon nitride}} (NBSN) is a {{promising}} <b>crucible</b> material for <b>the</b> repeated {{use in the}} directional solidification of multicrystalline (mc) silicon ingots for photovoltaic applications. Due to wetting and infiltration, however, silicon nitride in its initial state does not offer the desired reusability. In this work the sessile drop method is used to systematically study the wetting and infiltration behavior of NBSN after applying different oxidation procedures. It is found that the wetting of <b>the</b> NBSN <b>crucible</b> by liquid silicon can be prevented by the oxidation of the geometrical surface. The infiltration of liquid silicon into <b>the</b> porous <b>crucible</b> can be suppressed by oxygen enrichment within {{the volume of the}} NBSN, i. e. at the pore walls of <b>the</b> <b>crucibles.</b> <b>The</b> realized reusability of the NBSN is demonstrated by reusing a NBSN crucible six times for the directional solidification of undoped multicrystalline silicon ingots...|$|R

5|$|In {{developing}} the mythology behind the film, the creators used many inspirations.

Viewers are told that the Blair Witch is, according to legend, the ghost of Elly Kedward, a woman banished from the Blair Township (latter-day Burkittsville) for witchcraft in 1785.

40|$|Improved {{crucibles}} consisting {{mainly of}} metal-reinforced ceramic ampules {{have been developed}} for use in experiments in which material specimens are heated in <b>the</b> <b>crucibles</b> to various high temperatures, then quenched by, for example, plunging <b>the</b> <b>crucibles</b> into water at room temperature. In a traditional quench <b>crucible,</b> <b>the</b> gap between the ampule and the metal cartridge impedes the transfer of heat {{to such a degree that}} the quench rate (the rate of cooling of the specimen) can be too low to produce the desired effect in the specimen. One can increase the quench rate by eliminating the metal cartridge to enable direct quenching of the ampule, but then the thermal shock of direct quenching causes cracking of the ampule. In a quench <b>crucible</b> of <b>the</b> present improved type, there is no gap and no metal cartridge in the traditional sense. Instead, there is an overlay of metal in direct contact with the ampule, as shown on the right side of the figure. Because there is no gap between the metal overlay and the ampule, the heat-transfer rate can be much greater than it is in a traditional quench <b>crucible.</b> <b>The</b> metal overlay also reinforces the ampule against cracking...|$|R
