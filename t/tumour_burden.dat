While the tumour contained relatively high concentrations of PGE 2 -like material, that were markedly diminished by indomethacin treatment, our results did not confirm the recently proposed hypothesis that the anti-tumour effect arises from a restoration of depressed immune function. For example, mice that had completely eliminated their tumours under indomethacin administration were not immune to rechallenge. The tumour-bearing animals were not non-specifically immunodepressed, as their splenic PFC responses against SRBC were enhanced. However, while indomethacin augmented the PFC response in normal mice, this adjuvant effect was depressed in tumour-bearing animals. The spleen-cell PHA responses of tumour bearers were severely depressed, and such cells suppressed the PHA response of normal cells.

The MAC 16 tumour produced extensive weight loss in the host at small <b>tumour</b> <b>burdens</b> and without a reduction in either food or fluid intake. The weight loss was characterised by a decrease in both carcass fat and muscle mass which were directly proportional to the weight of the tumour. The weight loss has been correlated with the production of circulatory catabolic factors by the tumour, which degrade host muscle and adipose tissue in vitro. These factors were further characterised and {{have been shown to be}} distinct and separable by gel exclusion chromatography. The proteolytic factors (molecular weight > 150 k daltons) were distinguishable from the lipolytic factors which appeared related with molecular weights of approximately 3. 0, 1. 5 and 0. 7 k daltons. Lipolytic factors of the same molecular weights were identified in other tumour models and in the body fluids of tumour-bearing animals and cancer patients. These factors were not present in healthy individuals or in patients with other weight-losing conditions. Various temperatures studied reversed the weight loss seen in the cachexia induced by the MAC 16 adenocarcinoma in vivo. The effects of these treatments could be linked in vitro to the inhibition of the catabolic factors produced by the tumour. These results suggest that these factors may be responsible for the cachexia the tumour confers on its host. These factors may be useful in the understanding and therapy of cancer cachexia...|$|R

The initial <b>tumour</b> <b>burden</b> of each patient was assessed, combining tumour size of each involved region and number of regions involved. <b>Tumour</b> <b>burden</b> thus assessed proved to be the single most important prognostic factor with regard to disease free survival. Other known prognostic factors such as number of involved regions, mediastinal size, pathological stage, systemic symptoms, and ESR were related to <b>tumour</b> <b>burden</b> and lost their prognostic significance in a multivariate analysis. The only other factors of independent significance were histologic subtype and, to a lesser extent, sex. Combining <b>tumour</b> <b>burden</b> and histologic subtype made it possible to single out a group of patients with a very poor disease free survival. These patients also had a poorer survival from Hodgkin's disease and thus clearly candidates for additional initial treatment...|$|E
30|$|The {{skeletal}} <b>tumour</b> <b>burden</b> {{was evaluated}} {{by using a}} volumetric public domain semi-automated software program, Metavol [12]. A large VOI over the whole-body volume was applied with a threshold of SUV of ≥ 15 outlining all bone lesions per patient to allow extraction of total 18 F-fluoride tumour volume (FTVSUV 15). The total skeletal <b>tumour</b> <b>burden</b> by 18 F-fluoride uptake activity, total lesion 18 F-Fluoride burden (TLF), was calculated by summing the product of SUVmean and FTVSUV 15 for all lesions. The whole-body determination of skeletal <b>tumour</b> <b>burden</b> with 18 F-fluoride PET/CT has been reported previously to be feasible and with high inter-reader reproducibility [13]. By correlating all uptakes on PET with CT morphology, we excluded all non-metastatic physiological and degenerative 18 F-fluoride uptake. Uptake in a spinal compression fracture was excluded in a single patient.|$|E
30|$|Life {{expectancy}} is a {{major factor}} to be considered in the management of prostate cancer patients. Risk stratification schemes based on clinical T stage, Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are widely used to estimate risk in individual patients. The extent of bone metastases is also associated with survival [1, 2], but there has not been any clinically useful technique of quantifying the skeletal <b>tumour</b> <b>burden</b> and including this information in the risk assessment. Bone scintigraphy, however, is commonly used to assess skeletal <b>tumour</b> <b>burden</b> in prostate cancer patients, both in clinical routine and in nearly every clinical trial. In order to extract as much clinical information as possible from the bone scans, the Bone Scan Index (BSI) was developed as a quantitative tool to improve the interpretability and clinical relevance of the bone scan [3]. BSI is a method of expressing the <b>tumour</b> <b>burden</b> in the bone {{as a percentage of the}} total skeletal mass.|$|E
40|$|Summary. -Tumour antigen-induced {{inhibition}} of leucocyte adherence was modified {{for use in}} glass test tubes (Tube LAI assay) {{for the study of}} cell-mediated antitumour immunity to human malignant melanoma. Peripheral blood leucocytes (PBL) of 20 out of 25 patients (80 %) with active malignant melanoma responded to an extract of malignant melanoma with LAI, whereas only 4. 5 %o of 475 control subjects showed a response. The malignant melanoma patients reacted to both allogeneic and autologous extracts of malignant melanoma which indicates a common cross-reacting antigen. Malignant melanoma patients did not respond to unrelated tumour extracts. The LAI was mediated by PBL (monocytes) " armed" with cytophilic anti-tumour antibody specific for the sensitizing tumour antigen. The anti-tumour response of the malignant melanoma patients was dependent on the stage of the cancer, and 11 out of 13 Stage I patients had a positive NAI, whereas patients with disseminated cancer had decreased response. The diminished LAI in patients with large <b>tumour</b> <b>burdens</b> appeared {{to be the result of}} release of tumour antigen systemically. Also, surgery and chemotherapy depressed LAI. Although LAI was depressed after surgical excision of the cutaneous melanoma, most patients showed LAI 1 - 3 months later. Tumour-free melanoma patients monitored for one year by the Tube LAI assay showed a decline in their anti-tumour immunity 5 - 6 months after surgery. The NAI was low or negative after the 8 th post-surgical month in tumour-free patients. Patients with residual malignant melanoma showed persistent or recurrent LAI after the 8 th post-surgical month. LAI reactivity monitored after " curative " surgery for malignant melanoma may assist in determining whether the patient is tumour-free or has a recurrence. Abbreviations used are...|$|R
30|$|Corticosteroid use {{has been}} {{associated}} with many side effects, including insomnia. Unfortunately, corticosteroid therapy is often a necessary treatment in the treatment of CNS neoplasms. A recent study demonstrated an insomnia rate of 22  % in patients being treated for brain metastases (Sturdza et al. 2008). No study to date has looked at insomnia related to corticosteroid use in a primary brain tumour population. In our current study, there is a clear relationship between corticosteroid use and insomnia. Eighty-three of the 142 total patients taking steroids (52  %) related some degree of insomnia. This represents a higher incidence of insomnia compared to the brain metastasis steroid users, which may relate to differences in amount of corticosteroid given, differing concomitant therapies or different underlying disease processes. There was also a relatively high percentage (47  %) of patients not prescribed corticosteroids who related symptoms of insomnia. This again may relate to disruption of circadian rhythms due to <b>tumour</b> location, <b>burden</b> of psychosocial pressures, or secondary to other therapeutic interventions.|$|R
40|$|Bone marrow biopsies from 3229 {{patients}} with lymphoproliferative disorders and 1156 {{patients with}} benign or reactive lymphoproliferations were investigated and criteria for distinguishing between them are given. Bone marrow involvement {{was found in}} 89 % of multiple myeloma, 64 % of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and 8 % of Hodgkin's disease. According to the predominant proliferative cell type there were five major entities in multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: (1) plasmacytic; (2) lymphocytic; (3) hairy cell; (4) immunocytic; (5) centrocytic. These were further classified into distinct subtypes each of which had independent prognostic significance. The mode of spread of the lymphoproliferative disorders in the bone marrow showed one of six architectural patterns, which together with the quantity of infiltration in the biopsy (reflecting the <b>tumour</b> cell <b>burden)</b> had significant predictive value. These results demonstrate the value of bone marrow biopsies in the identification, classification and staging of lymphoproliferative disorders, {{as well as in}} monitoring the course of disease and the response to therapy...|$|R
