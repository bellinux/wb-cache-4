The NRL judiciary committee charged Hunt with a Grade-Three Careless High tackle and if pleading guilty would miss one week of premiership competition.

5|$|After the season, {{a number}} of Trojans were named as {{national}} award winners and finalists. Reggie Bush became USC's seventh Heisman Trophy winner with the second largest margin of victory ever. However, after the aforementioned NCAA investigation, USC would return its copy of Bush's Heisman Trophy, considering that Bush {{was determined to be}} ineligible <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> NCAA. On September 14, 2010, Bush announced that he would forfeit the Heisman and return his copy of the trophy. Bush also won the Doak Walker Award. Despite not winning the Maxwell Award, he won two other Player of the Year awards. Leinart, who was voted third in the Heisman Trophy ballot, was named as a finalist for the Davey O'Brien Award and the Maxwell Award, won the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, and was named by The Sporting News as their Sportsman of the Year. In addition, Pete Carroll was named a finalist for the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year award, and Jarrett was named a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award, though neither won.|$|E

In Pranks, Rice described his experience in 1976 {{when he tried to}} give President Ford's wife, Betty Ford, a skinned sheep's head.

25|$|After {{the end of}} the season, he {{had surgery}} on his right ankle and foot to correct {{deformities}} because of an abnormal arch that caused him to stretch his ankle tendons. He was expected to have the same surgery done on his left foot and to be sidelined until January, but a doctor considered he did not need it and he was ready <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> start of the 2006–07 NHL season. On 14 September 2006, Forsberg became the Flyers' 15th captain in team history, after Keith Primeau retired. The season was troubled for him: as the Flyers were having their worst season ever, Forsberg had not fully recovered from his right foot problems and had doubts about his future. With his contract ending at {{the end of the}} season and with no commitment on Forsberg's part to signing a new contract or to retire, on 15 February 12 days before the trade deadline, the Flyers traded him to the Nashville Predators in exchange for Ryan Parent, Scottie Upshall and Nashville's first- and third-round 2007 picks to boost Nashville's playoff run. At the Predators' last regular season game, Forsberg returned to Denver for the first time since leaving the Colorado Avalanche. He assisted on another former Avalanche player Paul Kariya's game-winning goal that eliminated any chances the Avalanche had of progressing to the playoffs, the first time ever the franchise had failed to do so since moving to Colorado. The Predators lost in the first round of the playoffs against the San Jose Sharks, with Forsberg scoring four points in the five game series. Forsberg had an average of less than one point per game in the regular season for the first time in his career and for the second time in the playoffs.|$|E

For example, in a controversial article for the Wall Street Journal, [...] contends that The Dark Knight is “a paean of praise to the fortitude and moral courage that has been shown by George W.

500|$|Gender was a {{recurring}} theme in Rix Nicholas's career, for better and for worse. Praise from a French art critic for her abilities was expressed by saying [...] " [...] Rix paints like a man!". An Australian critic was unsure what to say, admiring her composition but declaring her technique [...] "strangely unfeminine". Pigot considered that, when Rix Nicholas sought to stake out a woman's place in nationalist art in mid-twentieth century Australia, her career was ultimately penalised by her unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> male establishment's rules. Art historian Catherine Speck had a different perspective on Rix Nicholas's post-World War I work, suggesting that it never subsequently attained the quality of her Paris output, because her first husband's death in the Great War drove her to create nationalist images of inconsistent quality. In their reference work A Story of Australian Painting, Mary Eagle and John Jones considered Rix Nicholas, alongside Clarice Beckett, to be [...] "the best woman artist {{to emerge from the}} artistic milieu of Melbourne in the decade of the First World War".|$|E
500|$|With {{the film}} {{seemingly}} continuing plot threads first introduced in Age of Ultron, Mendelson wondered [...] "to {{what extent the}} whole 'Consequences galore!' narrative of Civil War will improve Age of Ultron. As much great stuff as that movie has ... the main hero foolishly/recklessly [...] a world-killing threat to Earth and lots of really bad stuff goes down and yet {{no one seems to}} care at the end ... What does it mean if Civil War does retroactively improve Age of Ultron? Will we be at a point where we really can’t judge a franchise installment on its own merits because a future installment may well fix the flaws a couple years down the line?" [...] McMillan continued some of Mendelson's thinking, feeling that Marvel was [...] "in an awkward place with Civil War" [...] regarding superhero destruction moving forward. He wondered how superhero oversight would [...] "actually prevent the kind of destruction that it's meant to stop ... unless the bad guys all agree <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> new rules" [...] as well. [...] "Worse still ... the destruction caused by superhero fights [...] foremost in viewers' heads ... the audience won't be able to enjoy the sight of the Hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of the property damage and/or whoever was standing {{on the other side of}} that wall. After Civil War, can Marvel go back to pretending that everyone is okay after any large scale event ever again?" ...|$|E

As it turned out Hall only played in two of the Tests in Australia with Wisden noting that [...] "old age, as cricketers go, had finally had its say". [...] The once fearsome pair of Hall and Griffith now [...] "resembled exhausted volcanoes." [...] Hall played the first Test against New Zealand at Eden Park in Auckland. Hall sustained an injury and was not able to compete the match, having bowled only 16 overs for the match and taking a solitary wicket. It was Hall's final Test match.
