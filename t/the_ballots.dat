5|$|Once all of <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> {{have been}} opened, the final post-scrutiny phase begins.|$|E
5|$|Once all votes {{have been}} cast, the first Scrutineer chosen shakes the container, {{and the last}} Scrutineer removes and counts <b>the</b> <b>ballots.</b> If the number of ballots does not {{correspond}} {{to the number of}} cardinal electors present (including sick cardinals in their rooms), <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> are burnt, unread, and the vote is repeated. If, however, no irregularities are observed, <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> may be opened and the votes counted. Each ballot is unfolded by the first Scrutineer; all three Scrutineers separately write down the name indicated on the ballot. The last of the Scrutineers reads the name aloud.|$|E
5|$|The Scrutineers add {{up all of}} the votes, and the Revisers check <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> and {{the names}} on the Scrutineers' lists to ensure that no error was made. <b>The</b> <b>ballots</b> are then all burned by the Scrutineers with the {{assistance}} of the Secretary of the College and the Masters of Ceremonies. If the first scrutiny held in any given morning or afternoon does not result in an election, the cardinals proceed to the next scrutiny immediately. The papers from both scrutinies are then burned together at the end of the second scrutiny.|$|E
50|$|Preelection {{lawsuits}} {{by voters}} {{may also be}} filed over other issues related to a local initiative under Proposition 218. Such lawsuits may include matters relating to the impartiality of <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> label (<b>the</b> language that appears on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> itself), <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> title and summary, the impartial analysis of the measure, or <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> arguments that appear in <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> pamphlet sent to voters. <b>The</b> <b>ballot</b> title and summary {{as well as the}} impartial analysis are generally prepared by the local government where issues relating to impartiality are likely to arise.|$|R
50|$|As a result, {{the council}} {{refused to go}} through with <b>the</b> <b>ballot,</b> and {{cancelled}} <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b>|$|R
50|$|This was {{the fourth}} and last time that the victorious {{candidate}} wasn’t on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> in all states. Alabama refused to let Johnson on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> in this election and Truman in 1948. In 1892, Grover Cleveland was not on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> in Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, North Dakota, or Wyoming, while in 1860, Lincoln did not appear on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> in any future Confederate state except Virginia.|$|R
5|$|Two Deputy Returning Officers {{were charged}} by the DGEQ with violating {{elections}} laws, but in 1996 were found not guilty (a decision upheld by the Quebec Court of Appeal), after {{it was found that}} <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> were not rejected in a fraudulent or irregular manner, {{and that there was no}} proof of conspiracy. A Quebec Court judge acquitted a Deputy Returning Officer charged with illegally rejecting 53% of <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> cast at his Chomedey polling district.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ballots</b> {{from abroad}} that were {{considered}} potentially contentious {{before the election}} proved to have very {{little effect on the}} result. While Peterle received more votes from abroad than Türk, both the total number of votes and the difference was smaller than expected (3693 for Peterle and 3040 for Türk).|$|E
5|$|In May 2015, Klein ISD held another bond {{referendum}} for $498.1 million, {{which passed}} with around 77% (4,571 of 6,033) of <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> for it. The bond includes $283.6 million to accommodate growth with new construction, including $121.9 million for High School No. 5, $47.1 million for Intermediate School No. 10, and $26.2 million for Elementary School No. 33, {{and expansion of}} gymnasia and classroom additions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} notable individuals filed as {{a candidate}} with FEC[...]Additionally, Peter Messina is on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> in Louisiana, New Hampshire, and Idaho.

50|$|Depending on {{the office}} and the state, it may be {{possible}} for a voter to cast a write-in vote for a candidate whose name does not appear on <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b> It is extremely rare for such a candidate to win office. In some cases, write-in votes are simply not counted. Having one's name printed on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> confers an enormous advantage over candidates who are not on <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b> <b>The</b> US Supreme Court has noted that write-in status is absolutely no substitute for being on <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b>|$|R
50|$|On August 9, the {{campaign}} {{announced that it}} would be on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> in Colorado with <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> label Socialist Party USA.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} three years of the awards, actresses were {{nominated}} as the best in their categories. At that time, all of their work during the qualifying period (as many as three films, in some cases) was listed after the award. However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of those films was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on <b>the</b> <b>ballots.</b>|$|E
5|$|Julie Bishop {{remained}} the deputy {{leader of the}} party, without being challenged for the position. Abbott thus became the third consecutive leader, after Nelson and Turnbull, for whom Bishop would serve as deputy. After <b>the</b> <b>ballots,</b> Bishop declared that she had voted for Turnbull, although Turnbull doubted her loyalty and Bishop resorted to proving it by retrieving her ballot papers.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the smoke from burning <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on <b>the</b> <b>ballots.</b> The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E
40|$|Australia {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{countries}} to introduce random ballot ordering, and is one of the few democracies to make voting compulsory. Using all federal election results since the introduction of random ballot ordering in 1984, we estimate the magnitude and correlates of <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> position effect in Australia. We find that being placed first on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> increases a candidate’s voteshare by about 1 percentage point, or 28 percent of the voteshare received by the typical candidate. Strikingly, however, we find that <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> order effect exists only for male candidates, who gain 1. 4 percentage points when they head <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b> By contrast, women gain no advantage from topping <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> paper. Our estimated effects are politically important, since 1 in 10 races are decided by margins of less than 1. 4 percentage points. We find no evidence that <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> order effect has risen or fallen over time. In percentage point terms, <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> order effect appears to be similar for major party, minor party and independent candidates. Across electorates, <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> order effect is larger where fluency in English is lower...|$|R
50|$|A {{group called}} the Keep Our Daughters Safe {{committee}} was responsible for getting the measure on <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b> <b>The</b> Keep Our Daughters Safe petition committee was largely funded by Oregon Right to Life, which contributed {{nearly all of the}} $350,000 raised to get the measure on <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b> Once on <b>the</b> <b>ballot,</b> a coalition of group and front committees supported Measure 43.|$|R
50|$|The voter marks <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> {{papers in}} <b>the</b> privacy of a voting booth. Polling {{stations}} must provide a writing implement for voters; usually pencils are provided (for practical reasons, as ink pens may dry out or spill), {{but there is}} no legal requirement for voters to mark their ballot papers with a pencil (they can use their own pen instead). If <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> paper has been spoilt, the presiding officer/poll clerk can issue a new one after <b>the</b> old <b>ballot</b> paper is cancelled. Before placing <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> papers in <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> box, <b>the</b> voter has (in theory) to show the presiding officer or the poll clerk the official mark and the unique identifying number printed on the reverse of <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> papers.|$|R
5|$|The {{color of}} the smoke {{indicates}} the results to the people assembled in St Peter's Square. Dark smoke (fumata nera) indicates that the ballot {{did not result in}} an election, while white smoke (fumata bianca) announces that a new pope was chosen. Originally, in the event a pope was not elected, damp straw was added to the fire to create dark smoke. In the event a new pope was elected, <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> were burned alone, creating white smoke.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} elections {{took place}} in December 1944, and were broadly considered free and fair, although only literate men were given the vote. Unlike in similar historical situations, none of the junta members stood for election. Arévalo's closest challenger was Adrián Recinos, whose campaign included a number of individuals identified with the Ubico regime. <b>The</b> <b>ballots</b> were tallied on 19 December 1944, and Arévalo won in a landslide, receiving {{more than four times}} as many ballots as the other candidates combined.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} three years of the awards, actors were {{nominated}} as the best in their categories. At that time, all of their work during the qualifying period (as many as three films, in some cases) was listed after the award. However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of those films was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on <b>the</b> <b>ballots.</b> The following year, this unwieldy and confusing system was replaced by the current system in which an actor is nominated for a specific performance in a single film. Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937, the category was officially limited to five nominations per year.|$|E
5000|$|Local {{governments in}} California are {{generally}} allowed to write <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> question for tax elections required under Proposition 218. <b>The</b> <b>ballot</b> question is <b>the</b> actual text that appears on <b>the</b> election <b>ballot</b> when voters cast their {{vote on a}} tax measure.

5|$|Johnson sought {{nomination}} by the 1868 Democratic National Convention in New York in July 1868. He remained {{very popular}} among Southern whites, and boosted that popularity by issuing, {{just before the}} convention, a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted, meaning that only Davis {{and a few others}} still might face trial. On the first ballot, Johnson was second to former Ohio representative George H. Pendleton, who had been his Democratic opponent for vice president in 1864. Johnson's support was mostly from the South, and fell away as <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> passed. On the 22nd ballot, former New York governor Horatio Seymour was nominated, and the President received only four votes, all from Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|On February 10, 1798, Garrard's son William, still {{serving in}} the state senate, {{introduced}} a bill to hold another vote on calling a constitutional convention. In May 1798, 9,188 of the 16,388 votes {{were in favor of}} calling a convention. Again, almost 5,000 of <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> contained no vote either way. On November 21, 1798, the House of Representatives voted 3615 in favor of a convention, and the Senate provided its requisite two-thirds majority days later. No official tally of the Senate's vote was published. The Assembly's vote rendered moot any doubts about the popular vote.|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 2007, Ripken {{was elected}} to the Hall of Fame, {{appearing}} on 537 out of 545 of <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> cast (98.53%), eight votes short of a unanimous selection. His percentage is the fourth highest in history, behind Ken Griffey Jr. (99.32 percent), Tom Seaver who received 98.84 percent of the vote and Nolan Ryan who received 98.79 percent. Tony Gwynn, who was appearing on his first ballot as well, was chosen alongside Ripken. Both Hall of Fame-Elects were formally inducted on July 29, 2007. The induction ceremony was attended by a record 75,000 people including special guests of Ripken: John Travolta, Kelly Preston, Steve Geppi, and Ron Shapiro (Ripken's agent during his career).|$|E
50|$|Since 2002, the Libertarian Party of Alabama has {{not been}} able to collect the nearly 60,000 raw {{signatures}} that would be required to regain statewide ballot access. However, they have successfully been able to place their presidential candidate on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> as an independent ever since. In 2004 presidential candidate Michael Badnarik appeared on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> as an independent. In 2008 presidential candidate Bob Barr appeared on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> as an independent. In 2012 presidential candidate Gary Johnson appeared on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> as an independent.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes a local {{government}} may refuse {{to place a}} local Proposition 218 initiative on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> even though <b>the</b> required number of signatures has been obtained and certified. Once a local initiative measure has qualified for <b>the</b> <b>ballot,</b> <b>the</b> responsible local entity or official generally has a mandatory duty to place the initiative on <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b> [...] If <b>the</b> responsible local entity or official refuses to place the initiative on <b>the</b> <b>ballot,</b> this can force the initiative proponents to file a lawsuit to legally require the {{local government}} to place the initiative on <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b> Even if such a lawsuit by the initiative proponents is successful, it often results in a delay in when the initiative measure eventually appears on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> which is often part of the strategy of a hostile local government.

5|$|The Virginia Secession Ordinance was to “repeal the {{ratification}} of the Constitution of the United States of America, by the State of Virginia.” Two days after the secession resolution and {{a month before the}} referendum, the Confederate flag was raised over Virginia's capitol building, a delegation was sent to vote in the Confederate Congress, state militias were activated and a Confederate army was invited to occupy Richmond. Though <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> from Unionist counties were lost, the total referendum votes counted numbered more than that of the 1860 presidential election by including men voting viva voce aloud in Confederate army camps, approving secession by 128,884 to 32,134.|$|E
5|$|The electors {{were then}} told {{to break up}} the Convention and {{assemble}} into the formal Assembly or Council. The electors voted by placing a pebble or written ballot into an appropriate jar. The baskets that held the votes were watched by specific officers, who then counted <b>the</b> <b>ballots,</b> and reported the results to the presiding magistrate. The majority of votes in any Curia, Tribe, or Century decided how that Curia, Tribe, or Century voted. Each Curia, Tribe, or Century received one vote, regardless of how many electors each Tribe or Century held. Once a majority of Curiae, Tribes, or Centuries voted in the same way on a given measure, the voting ended, and the matter was decided.|$|E
5|$|Meltzer {{began the}} Hall of Fame by {{choosing}} {{a list of}} 122 inaugural inductees in 1996. Since then, wrestlers from past and present, others employed in the professional wrestling industry, and wrestling journalists and historians have been selected by Meltzer to cast secret ballots to determine annual groups of inductees. Voting criteria include {{the length of time}} spent in wrestling, historical significance, ability to attract viewers, and wrestling ability. Inductees must have at least 15 years of experience in the wrestling business or be over 35 years old and have 10 years of experience. To gain membership in the hall, potential inductees must receive 60% support on <b>the</b> <b>ballots</b> from their geographic region. Any person that gets less than 10% of the vote is eliminated from the ballot. If a person fails to get inducted 15 years after being put on the ballot, they must get 50% of the vote or be eliminated. There are 211 inductees, including the seven tag teams.|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, some Democrats accused Barbour {{of trying}} to {{influence}} {{the outcome of the}} 2008 Senate race by placing the candidates at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b> Since Mississippi electoral law mandates the placing of federal elections at the top of <b>the</b> <b>ballot,</b> Barbour was ordered by a circuit court to comply with <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> laws.|$|R
