5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{publicity}} the correspondence created, a freedom of information request was lodged concerning Project A119. It was only <b>then</b> <b>that</b> A Study of Lunar Research Flights– Volume I was made public, over forty years after its inception.

5|$|Biology {{began to}} quickly develop and grow with Anton van Leeuwenhoek's {{dramatic}} {{improvement of the}} microscope.

5|$|Data URIs: The actual {{images that}} form the eyes are encoded as data URIs, which allow {{multimedia}} to be embedded in web pages rather than stored as a separate file. Acid2 tests the most common case, where a binary image is base64-encoded into text and <b>then</b> <b>that</b> encoded text is included in a data URI in the web page. Although the IETF published the data URI specification in 1998, they never formally adopted it as a standard. Nonetheless, the HTML 4.01 specification references the data URI scheme, and data URI support has now been implemented in most browsers.|$|E

5|$|During Milhail Kogălniceanu's lifetime, {{there was}} {{confusion}} regarding his exact birth year, with several sources erroneously indicating it as 1806; {{in his speech}} to the Romanian Academy, he acknowledged this, and gave his exact birth date as present in a register kept by his father. It was also <b>then</b> <b>that</b> he mentioned his godmother was Marghioala Calimach, a Callimachi boyaress who married into the Sturdza family, and {{was the mother of}} Mihail Sturdza (Kogălniceanu's would-be protector and foe).|$|E
5|$|For the Muslim sepoys in the 5th Light Infantry, {{interaction}} with Kasim Mansur, {{who was an}} Indian Muslim merchant in Singapore, served to fuel this sense of divided loyalties further. Kasim Mansur together with a local imam, Nur Alam Shah, would often host members of the 5th Light Infantry at Mansur’s home and it was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> the duo persuaded the Muslim sepoys {{to adhere to the}} fatwa issued by the Ottoman Sultan and to turn their guns against their British commanding officers and contribute towards the war against these kafirs who were battling their Muslim brothers who were defending the Caliphate in the West. It was within this context that the plan was hatched for the mutiny.|$|E

Trescothick followed this double century with a knock of 76 off 35 balls against Northamptonshire, with five fours and seven sixes.|$|E
5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive charge of the nuclei, <b>then</b> <b>that</b> object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, the object {{is said to be}} negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E
5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence {{of the speed of}} light. If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, <b>then</b> <b>that</b> would allow the presence of an electric field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. This thus allows one to test Coulomb's law to very high precision. A null result of such an experiment has set a limit of m ≲ 10−14eV/c2.|$|E

5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from.

5|$|Pitts and Tuck renamed {{their product}} from Spacewar to Galaxy Game due to anti-war {{sentiment}} and founded {{a company called}} Mini-Computer Applications in June 1971 to operate the game as it neared completion. The development of the prototype machine took around {{three and a half}} months. By August, they were well into development and had gotten permission to place the machine at the Tresidder student union building at Stanford as a test site. It was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> they received a call from Nolan Bushnell, who had heard of their project and wanted to show them his similar project he was working on.|$|E
5|$|Second, it was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> Japan {{underwent}} {{a period of}} intense Westernization in order to compete with other developed countries. Initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to Japan but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style. Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan. However, {{it was not until}} after the Second World War that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzo Tange and then with theoretical movements like Metabolism.|$|E

5|$|Support for {{the protests}} started to {{extend to the}} local {{community}} when Jean Gosling, a lollipop lady in Wanstead, upon learning of the tree's impending destruction, rallied the support of local children (and was later fired from her job for doing so while wearing her uniform), who in turn recruited their parents into the protests. It was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> the non-resident radicals realised that they had significant local support. When local residents gathered for a tree dressing ceremony on 6 November, they found their way barred by security fencing. With support from the protesters, they pulled it down.|$|E
5|$|That's why I say {{the players}} didn't stab the ACB in the back. The administrators had {{numerous}} opportunities {{to reach a}} compromise but displayed {{little interest in the}} welfare of the players. It wasn't really surprising <b>then</b> <b>that</b> more than 50 players from around the world signed lucrative WSC contracts and a revolution was born. About half of the WSC players were from Australia and this high ratio can, in part, be attributed to Bradman's tight-fisted approach to the ACB's money.|$|E
5|$|The Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem, {{published}} in 1968, {{shows that in}} a given universe, if all freely falling observers measure the cosmic background radiation to have exactly the same properties in all directions (that is, they measure the background radiation to be isotropic), <b>then</b> <b>that</b> universe is an isotropic and homogeneous Friedmann–Lemaître spacetime.
