5|$|The {{rear wheel}} is {{prevented}} from precessing {{as the front}} wheel does by friction of the tires on the ground, and so continues to lean as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> not spinning at all. Hence gyroscopic forces do not provide any resistance to tipping.|$|E

5|$|Gallium-67 salts such as gallium citrate and gallium nitrate {{are used}} as {{radiopharmaceutical}} agents in the nuclear medicine imaging known as gallium scan. The radioactive isotope 67Ga is used, and the compound or salt of gallium is unimportant. The body handles Ga3+ in many ways as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> Fe3+, and the ion is bound (and concentrates) in areas of inflammation, such as infection, and in areas of rapid cell division. This allows such sites to be imaged by nuclear scan techniques.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine {{perchlorate}} (ClOClO3) is a {{pale yellow}} liquid {{that is less}} stable than ClO2 and decomposes at room temperature to form chlorine, oxygen, and dichlorine hexoxide (Cl2O6). Chlorine perchlorate may also be considered a chlorine derivative of perchloric acid (HOClO3), similar to the thermally unstable chlorine derivatives of other oxoacids: examples include chlorine nitrate (ClONO2, vigorously reactive and explosive), and chlorine fluorosulfate (ClOSO2F, more stable but still moisture-sensitive and highly reactive). Dichlorine hexoxide is a dark-red liquid that freezes to form a solid which turns yellow at −180°C: it is usually made by reaction of chlorine dioxide with oxygen. Despite attempts to rationalise it as the dimer of ClO3, it reacts more as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> chloryl perchlorate, +−, which has been confirmed to be the correct structure of the solid. It hydrolyses in water to give a mixture of chloric and perchloric acids: the analogous reaction with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride does not proceed to completion.|$|E
25|$|The {{administrative}} boundary of Wales was confirmed in the Local Government Act 1972. Whether Monmouthshire {{was part of}} Wales, or an English county treated for most purposes as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> Welsh, was also settled by the 1972 Act, which included it in Wales.|$|E

50|$|<b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} largest genus within Megaspilidae, {{little is known about}} its life history. A few species are known to <b>be</b> ectoparasitoids, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> likely that the genus also {{contains}} endoparasitoids as well, since the sister genus Dendrocerus contains both life strategies. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> likely that Conostigmus contains hyperparasitoids as well.|$|R
25|$|In practice, {{although}} not a requirement, using a frame of reference based upon the fixed stars as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> an inertial frame of reference introduces very little discrepancy. For example, the centrifugal acceleration of the Earth because of its rotation about the Sun is about thirty million times {{greater than that of}} the Sun about the galactic center.|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory bowel {{disease is}} an {{inflammatory}} condition affecting the bowel walls, and includes the subtypes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. While Crohn's {{can affect the}} entire gastrointestinal tract, ulcerative colitis {{is limited to the}} large intestine. Crohn's disease is widely regarded as an autoimmune disease. Although ulcerative colitis is often treated as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> an autoimmune disease, there is no consensus that it actually is such.|$|E

25|$|The MRT was a {{very recent}} {{addition}} for Singapore and as such, the authorities {{wanted to keep the}} MRT map as easy to use for Singaporeans as possible. Hence, each direction of travel was colour-coded in a different colour as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> a line on its own. In that way, confusion in decision-making when taking a certain line in a certain direction would be reduced for passengers. However, this reduced the amount of colours available for new lines and was not in line with international practice.|$|E

25|$|The {{possibility}} of evacuating these difficult to defend zones was considered, but {{the policy of}} Haganah was set by David Ben-Gurion. He stated that 'what the Jewish people have has to be conserved. No Jewish person should abandon his or her house, farm, kibbutz or job without authorization. Every outpost, every colony, whether it is isolated or not, must be occupied as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> Tel Aviv itself. No Jewish settlement was evacuated until the invasion of May 1948. Only a dozen kibbutzim in Galilee {{as well as those}} of Gush Etzion sent women and children into the safer interior zones.|$|E
25|$|As players move {{within their}} real world surroundings, their avatars move within the game's map. Different Pokémon species reside in {{different}} areas of the world; for example, water-type Pokémon are generally found near water. When a player encounters a Pokémon, it may be viewed either in augmented reality (AR) mode or with a live rendered, generic background. AR mode uses the camera and gyroscope on the player's mobile device to display an image of a Pokémon as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> in the real world. Players can take screenshots of the Pokémon they encounter either with or without the AR mode activated.|$|E

He also claims to be in possession of the secret Templar map. Agliè becomes frustrated with Belbo's refusal to let him see this (non-existent) map. He frames Belbo as a terrorist suspect in order {{to force him to}} come to Paris. Agliè has cast himself as the head of a secret spiritual brotherhood, which includes Mr. Garamond, Colonel Ardenti and many of the Diabolical authors. Belbo tries to get help from De Angelis, but he has just transferred to Sardinia after an attempted car bombing, and refuses to get involved.|$|E

25|$|The Stranger then tells Marisol {{to go to}} Ramón and for Julio to take Jesús home. He learns from Silvanito that Ramón had framed Julio for {{cheating}} {{during a}} cards game and taken Marisol as his prisoner, forcing her to live with him. That night, while the Rojos are celebrating, the Stranger rides out and frees Marisol, shooting the guards and wrecking the house in which she is being held, making it appear as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> attacked by the Baxters. He gives Marisol some money and tells her family to leave the town. When the Rojos discover that he freed Marisol, they capture and torture him, but he escapes. Believing the Stranger to be protected by the Baxters, the Rojos {{set fire to the}} Baxter home and massacre the entire family as they run out of the burning building. Ramon kills John Baxter and Antonio after pretending to spare them. Consuelo, John Baxter's wife, appears and curses the Rojos for killing her unarmed husband and son. She is then shot and killed by Esteban.|$|E
25|$|Duke Snider {{finished}} second to teammate Campanella in the MVP voting by just five points, 226–221, with each man receiving eight first place votes. The voting {{then as now}} was conducted by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Each voting member, one from each major league city, filled out a ballot selecting ten men. A player receiving a first place vote got 14 points, 9 points for second, and then values of 8–7–6–5–4–3–2–1 for those in places 3 through 10. A writer from Philadelphia who was sick and who had become hospitalized had turned in a ballot with Campanella listed in position number 1 as well as position number 5. The assumption had been that the writer had meant to write Snider's name {{into one of those}} slots. Unable to get a clarification from the ill writer the BBWAA, after considering disallowing the ballot, decided to accept it, count the first place vote for Campanella and count the fifth place vote as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> left blank. Had the ballot been disallowed, the vote would have been won by Snider by three points. Had Snider gotten the fifth place vote, the final vote would have favored Snider 227–226. Duke did, however, win the Sporting News National League Player of the Year Award for 1955 and the Sid Mercer Award.|$|E
