5|$|Cott {{describes}} simple experiments such as <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> {{that have}} changed colour to match a pale background survived better (64% to 42%) {{on such a}} background than fish which had not. He also quotes some anecdotal observations on wild animals with similar but not quantified results.|$|E
5|$|Experiments done by William Tavolga provide {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> have pain and fear responses. For instance, in Tavolga's experiments, toadfish grunted when electrically shocked {{and over time}} they came to grunt at the mere sight of an electrode.|$|E
5|$|Zinc in rivers {{flowing through}} {{industrial}} and mining areas {{can be as}} high as 20ppm. Effective sewage treatment greatly reduces this; treatment along the Rhine, for example, has decreased zinc levels to 50ppb. Concentrations of zinc as low as 2ppm adversely affects the amount of oxygen <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> can carry in their blood.|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} believed <b>that</b> <b>fishes</b> in shad-ed headwater tropical streams rarely use their feeding specializations {{and that they}} depend primarily on allochthonous food such as ter-restrial arthropods, terrestrial plant debris and other food that drops into the water (Lowe-McConnell 1987). However, some studies have indicated <b>that</b> <b>fishes</b> inhabiting these environment may depend on autochthonous items such as periphyton, aquatic insects an...|$|R
50|$|Records from 1340 show <b>that</b> <b>fishing</b> was an {{important}} industry in Studland in the 14th century.|$|R
25|$|Fish bones, fishing hooks, barbed {{spears and}} {{harpoons}} show <b>that</b> <b>fishing</b> {{was an important}} part of the economy.|$|R
5|$|In 2010 a new fish counter was {{commissioned}} for the Shimna {{river and the}} initial results indicated <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> numbers had reached approximately 76% of the conservation limit (the number of fish required to spawn) in the 2010 season. This is an improvement from the estimated 12% in 2009. However, in 2014 concerns about salmon levels in the river were raised again after {{it was observed that}} the number of eggs being laid was still below conservation limits.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that aposematism and mimicry is less evident in marine invertebrates than terrestrial insects because predation is a more intense selective force for many insects, which also disperse as adults rather than as larvae and have much shorter generation times. Further, there is evidence <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> predators such as blueheads may adapt to visual cues more rapidly than do birds, making aposematism less effective.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory cues may be {{important}} in salmon, which are known {{to return to the}} exact river where they hatched. Lockley reports experimental evidence <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> such as minnows can accurately tell the difference between the waters of different rivers. Salmon may use their magnetic sense to navigate to within reach of their river, and then use olfaction to identify the river at close range.|$|E
5000|$|A {{writer for}} The New York Times said <b>that</b> <b>Fish's</b> [...] "ambitious still life {{painting}} helped resuscitate realism in the 1970s" [...] {{and that her}} work depicting everyday objects imbued them with a [...] "bold optical and painterly energy". Critic Vincent Katz concurs, stating <b>that</b> <b>Fish's</b> career [...] "can be summed up as the revitalization of the still-life genre, no mean feat {{when one considers that}} still life has often been considered the lowest type of objective painting".|$|R
50|$|Rose concludes <b>that</b> <b>fishes</b> {{have survived}} well in an {{evolutionary}} sense without {{the full range}} of nociception typical of humans or other mammals.|$|R
40|$|Studies {{with several}} fish species have shown <b>that</b> <b>fishes</b> during {{transport}} {{are exposed to}} different stressful stimuli that may cause adverse physiological reactions, which may lead to mortality. Given the fact <b>that</b> ornamental <b>fish</b> represent a high economical value, reduction of stress in ornamental fish during transport to minimise mortality is essential...|$|R
5|$|Research by Jennifer A. Clack and {{her colleagues}} showed that the very {{earliest}} tetrapods, animals similar to Acanthostega, were wholly aquatic and quite unsuited to life on land. This {{is in contrast to}} the earlier view <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> had first invaded the land — either in search of prey (like modern mudskippers) or to find water when the pond they lived in dried out — and later evolved legs, lungs, etc.|$|E
5|$|The diet of Pteranodon {{is known}} to have {{included}} fish; fossilized fish bones have been found in the stomach area of one Pteranodon, and a fossilized fish bolus has been found between the jaws of another Pteranodon, specimen AMNH 5098. Numerous other specimens also preserve fragments of fish scales and vertebrae near the torso, indicating <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> made up a majority of the diet of Pteranodon (though they may also have taken invertebrates).|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} moat {{around the}} tower {{would have been}} a simple design, but it was redesigned in the 1460s to provide a walkway around the outside of the Great Tower. The niches in the walls of the walkway are of 17th-century origin, and would originally have held classical statues - the walkway would have provided a dignified way of admiring the Great Tower. It is likely <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> would have been bred in the moat.|$|E
50|$|From ancient {{representations}} {{and literature}} {{it is clear}} <b>that</b> <b>fishing</b> boats were typically small, lacking a mast or sail, and were only used close to the shore.|$|R
50|$|Many fishermen, while {{accepting}} <b>that</b> <b>fishing</b> is dangerous, staunchly {{defend their}} independence. Many proposed laws and additional regulation to increase safety have been defeated because fishermen oppose them.|$|R
25|$|It seems {{logical to}} assume <b>that</b> <b>fishing</b> would have played some role in feeding river communities, though {{at least at}} Soba {{it appears to have}} been only of minor relevance.|$|R
5|$|I was to {{keep the}} fish before me in a tin tray, and {{occasionally}} moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar... In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in <b>that</b> <b>fish,</b> and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen was dry all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{construction}} of the Canning Dam, among other drinking water supply dams, water flow into the Canning River has been reduced by up to 96%. A number of freshwater fish species which are endemic to the south-west of Western Australia are found in the Canning River system, however studies of fish and fish habitats in the area have shown <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> numbers are low due to a loss of habitat and a loss of linkage between breeding areas due to low flows, preventing fish migrating upstream and reaching important breeding and nursery grounds. Stagnant water caused by a lack of water flow has provided a suitable habitat for successful breeding of an introduced pest, the mosquitofish.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts possess highly {{developed}} sensory organs. Nearly all daylight fish have colour vision {{at least as}} good as a normal human's. Many fish also have chemoreceptors responsible for acute senses of taste and smell. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Fish sense sounds in a variety of ways, using the lateral line, the swim bladder, and in some species the Weberian apparatus. Fish orient themselves using landmarks, and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Experiments with mazes show <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> possess the spatial memory needed to make such a mental map.|$|E
50|$|Pike, perch {{and brown}} trout are all {{present in the}} loch. It should be noted <b>that</b> <b>fishing</b> in or on the loch is not {{permitted}} {{at any time of}} year.|$|R
50|$|Reports in Bangladeshi {{newspapers}} indicate <b>that</b> <b>fishing</b> cats live in {{all divisions}} of Bangladesh but are severely threatened; villagers {{killed at least}} 30 fishing cats between January 2010 and March 2013.|$|R
6000|$|The {{whole of}} this {{operation}} took me upwards of two hours. It will be seen, therefore, <b>that</b> <b>fishing</b> in Norway, as I have said, cannot be called [...] "the gentle art." ...|$|R
25|$|In 2010, {{one study}} found <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> larvae can drift on ocean {{currents}} and reseed fish stocks at a distant location. This finding demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> populations can be connected to distant locations {{through the process of}} larval drift.|$|E
25|$|Historically, some doubted <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> could {{experience}} pain. Laboratory {{experiments have}} shown <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> do react to painful stimuli (e.g., injections of bee venom) {{in a similar}} way to mammals. This is controversial and has been disputed. The expansion of fish farming as well as animal welfare concerns in society has led to research into more humane and faster ways of killing fish. In large-scale operations like fish farms, stunning fish with electricity or putting them into water saturated with nitrogen so that they cannot breathe, results in death more rapidly than just taking them out of the water. For sport fishing, it is recommended <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> be killed soon after catching them by hitting them on the head followed by bleeding out or by stabbing the brain with a sharp object (called pithing or ike jime in Japanese).|$|E
25|$|EU quotas {{can mean}} <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> are thrown {{overboard}} after being caught; yet {{as they are}} dead, this does not alleviate the problem as it was intended to.|$|E
60|$|Rollo had {{forgotten}} this fact {{when he said}} <b>that</b> <b>fishes</b> never ate; and, having nothing to say in reply to it, now, he was silent, and only looked at his fish.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell Hawkins I've {{abandoned}} <b>that</b> <b>fishing</b> trip," [...] he said. [...] "I've {{got another}} job." [...] Then he faced Mr. Merrick. His smile was not pretty, {{but it was}} a smile.|$|R
50|$|Pre-Boreal {{settlements}} {{have been}} found in north-central Europe, such as at Friesack. There an unusual find of net fragments made from plant fibers suggested <b>that</b> <b>fishing</b> was an important part of life.|$|R
25|$|However, in 2012, a {{group of}} {{researchers}} led by Rose reviewed the literature, and concluded again <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> are not conscious and therefore do not feel pain.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the fifty days following Easter in the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, fish is not allowed during Lent, or on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Paramon days. Other than <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> and shellfish are allowed during fasting days.|$|E
25|$|As for tool use, {{construction}} behaviour may {{be mostly}} innate. Yet {{it can be}} sophisticated, and the fact <b>that</b> <b>fish</b> can make judicious repairs to their creation suggests intelligence. Construction methods in fishes {{can be divided into}} three categories: excavations, pile-ups, and gluing.|$|E
50|$|The Atlantic cod trade {{generated}} {{a demand for}} shipbuilding and for the many support services <b>that</b> <b>fishing</b> requires. It also {{generated a}} shipping industry that was related to Jersey’s tax free status.|$|R
2500|$|The {{report of}} the French Marine Accident Investigation Office (Bureau d'enquêtes sur les événements de mer or BEAmer) was {{published}} on 27 November [...] 2006 and examined {{a number of possible}} causes; it rejected the proposition <b>that</b> <b>fishing</b> lines got entangled with a military submarine and concluded that [...] "the hypothesis <b>that</b> the <b>fishing</b> line got buried in a sandbank is more consistent with the evidence." ...|$|R
25|$|Until {{the mid-1990s}} New Bedford {{was home to}} a {{thriving}} commercial <b>fishing</b> community <b>that</b> <b>fished</b> Georges Bank, but in 1996 action was taken to reduce over-fishing, which devastated commercial fishing in the area.|$|R
