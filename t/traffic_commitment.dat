50|$|Most {{commercial}} Internet transit agreements {{require a}} minimum <b>traffic</b> <b>commitment</b> level, which the customer must pay regardless if their usage is below that point. If usage exceeds the contracted commitment level, the customer usually pays {{based on an}} agreed per-megabit charge. Billing is typically done based on the 95th percentile. As a not-for-profit, TorIX charges a small port fee based on {{the speed of the}} port the member desires, rather than the amount of traffic traveling over TorIX. The more traffic, the better, but peers are not penalized for lower traffic levels.|$|E
50|$|The {{fight against}} {{trafficking}} {{in human beings}} has become a priority of the OSCE, which applies the OSCE concept of common and comprehensive security and its three dimensions(politico-military, economic and human dimension) to address this grave crime and human rights violation. Since the late 1990s, the OSCE has created political and operational frameworks to combat human <b>trafficking</b> - political <b>commitments</b> adopted by the OSCE participating States from 2000 to 2008 and relevant structures designed to provide assistance to them in the implementation of these comprehensive Ministerial Decisions and anti-trafficking projects and programmes.|$|R
40|$|In October 2014, Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens {{announced}} {{the appointment of}} a dedicated human trafficking prosecutor. The scale and horrific consequences of human trafficking have prompted international concern, with the United States ratifying the UN Trafficking Protocol (supplementing the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime) in 2005. At the same time, domestic sex trafficking often involved children who have never crossed state lines. While federal law controls important components of assisting victims of human trafficking, the prevention and punishment of human <b>trafficking</b> requires the <b>commitment</b> of state resources and the enforcement of state laws. Georgia has tough laws and an expressed commitment to aiding victims. This panel discussed both the prosecution of traffickers and the many legal or social service issues involved in assisting victims...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} perceived travel possibilities (or subjective choice-sets, consideration-sets) of car {{and train}} travellers {{on the main}} corridors {{to the city of}} Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and associations with traveller and trip characteristics. We conducted secondary analysis on a survey sample consisting of 7950 train and 19, 232 car travellers. Forty-five percent of train travellers had a car in their objective choice-set, 27 % of them would however never use it for this trip. Trip destination city centre, trip purpose, paying for the trip, public transport <b>commitment,</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion and parking problems were associated with consideration of car as alternative. Forty-two percent of car travellers had public transport in their subjective choice-set. The ratio between perceived public transport and objective car travel time stood out as determinant of consideration-sets, next to destination city centre, trip purpose, travel time and private versus company car ownership. On average, car travellers' perceptions of public transport travel time exceeded objective values by 46 %. We estimated that if perceptions would be more accurate, two out of three car travellers that currently do not see public transport as an alternative would include it in their choice-set, and use it from time to time. This effect has strong theoretical and policy implications. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Actin {{dynamics}} and membrane <b>trafficking</b> influence cell <b>commitment</b> to {{programmed cell death}} through largely undefined mechanisms. To investigate how actin and recycling endosome (RE) trafficking can engage death signaling, we studied the death program induced by the adenovirus early region 4 open reading frame 4 (E 4 orf 4) protein as a model. We found {{that in the early}} stages of E 4 orf 4 expression, Src-family kinases (SFKs), Cdc 42, and actin perturbed the organization of the endocytic recycling compartment and promoted the transport of REs to the Golgi apparatus, while inhibiting recycling of protein cargos to the plasma membrane. The resulting changes in Golgi membrane dynamics that relied on actin-regulated Rab 11 a membrane trafficking triggered scattering of Golgi membranes and contributed to the progression of cell death. A similar mobilization of RE traffic mediated by SFKs, Cdc 42 and Rab 11 a also contributed to Golgi fragmentation and to cell death progression in response to staurosporine, in a caspase-independent manner. Collectively, these novel findings suggest that diversion of RE trafficking to the Golgi complex through a pathway involving SFKs, Cdc 42, and Rab 11 a plays a general role in death signaling by mediating regulated changes in Golgi dynamics...|$|R
