25|$|A Howler is a blood-red {{letter sent}} to signify extreme anger or {{to convey a}} message very loudly and publicly. When it is opened, the sender's voice, which has been magically {{magnified}} to a deafening volume, bellows a message at the recipient and then self-destructs. If it is not opened or there is a delay in opening it, the letter smolders, explodes violently, and shouts <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>out</b> even louder than normal. In the film version, the Howler folds itself into an origami-style set of lips and eyes, and shouts <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>out</b> and then shreds itself into scraps of paper before it burns itself.|$|E

That was the impetus for doing what I did; that's the reason I jammed HBO; that's the reason I sent them a polite message. What I do regret is that I was young and fairly naïve {{in the ways of}} the media. I didn't grasp the fact that no one understood my motives and that everyone would make assumptions. Had I known that up front I would have been much more fervent in explaining my motivations. I had no animus and I had no malice in my heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hurum {{considered}} {{that the risk}} of buying the fossil had paid off, and said that [...] "You need an icon or two in a museum to drag people in, this is our Mona Lisa and it will be our Mona Lisa for the next 100 years." [...] He has been described as [...] "a modern-era, media-savvy scientist with the right amounts of showmanship, populist sensibility, and disregard for the normal avenues of scientific prestige required to pull this off". The debut in [...] "an astonishingly slick, multi-component media package" [...] required exceptional coordination between networks, museums, producers and scientists while maintaining a level of secrecy which is hard to attain in modern circumstances. In interviews published on 27 May, Hurum stated that it was good that they had got <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>out</b> that primates were rooted deep in time, but that some of the slogans were too much and the publicity got completely out of control. He disclosed that he paid nearly $750,000 (£465,000) for the specimen, but felt it was worthwhile to make the fossil available for scientific investigation instead of it being bought by a private collector and hidden away. Others including Chris Beard were concerned that the price and publicity could lead to profiteering by amateur collectors, and make acquisition of specimens for research purposes more difficult.|$|E
