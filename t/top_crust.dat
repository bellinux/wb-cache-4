500|$|Fruit was readily {{combined}} with meat, fish and eggs. The recipe for Tart de brymlent, a fish pie from the recipe collection Forme of Cury, includes {{a mix of}} figs, raisins, apples and pears with fish (salmon, codling or haddock) and pitted damson plums under the <b>top</b> <b>crust.</b> It was considered important {{to make sure that}} the dish agreed with contemporary standards of medicine and dietetics. This meant that food had to be [...] "tempered" [...] according to its nature by an appropriate combination of preparation and mixing certain ingredients, condiments and spices; fish was seen as being cold and moist, and best cooked in a way that heated and dried it, such as frying or oven baking, and seasoned with hot and dry spices; beef was dry and hot and should therefore be boiled; pork was hot and moist and should therefore always be roasted. In some recipe collections, alternative ingredients were assigned with more consideration to the humoral nature than what a modern cook would consider to be similarity in taste. In a recipe for quince pie, cabbage is said to work equally well, and in another turnips could be replaced by pears.|$|E

60|$|Daisy {{laughed at}} the idea, and {{scattered}} the dabs with a liberal hand. Then she rolled and rolled with her delightful little pin, and having got her paste ready proceeded to cover the plates with it. Next the apple was sliced in, sugar and cinnamon lavishly sprinkled over it, and then the <b>top</b> <b>crust</b> put on with breathless care.|$|E
50|$|Melonpan and {{pineapple}} bun from Hong Kong are very similar. By comparison the Japanese style is lighter in weight and taste, slightly drier {{and has a}} firmer outer layer (including <b>top</b> cookie <b>crust)</b> which resists flaking unlike its Hong Kong counterpart, which should be treated with care as the <b>top</b> cookie <b>crust</b> tends to flake easily. The Hong Kong version is also moister and is generally soft {{on the outside and}} inside and has a stronger butter flavour.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{interesting}} hydrogeologic {{feature is}} that some of the sinkholes appear to be in the process of closing up at the <b>top</b> as <b>crusts</b> of travertine (a form of calcium carbonate) form at their surfaces.

60|$|There {{you have}} the <b>top</b> <b>crust.</b> There will be four hundred and seventy-five men and women present who can draw upon their {{training}} and deliver incontrovertible judgments concerning cheese, and leather, and cattle, and hardware, and soap, and tar, and candles, and patent medicines, and dreams, and apparitions, and garden trucks, and cats, and baby food, and warts, and hymns, and time-tables, and freight-rates, and summer resorts, and whiskey, and law, and surgery, and dentistry, and blacksmithing, and shoemaking, and dancing, and Huyler's candy, and mathematics, and dog fights, and obstetrics, and music, and sausages, and dry goods, and molasses, and railroad stocks, and horses, and literature, and labor unions, and vegetables, and morals, and lamb's fries, and etiquette, and agriculture.

60|$|Such a busy {{little woman}} as she was! So full of self-importance and {{trying so hard}} not to smile, or seem {{uncertain}} about anything! It was a perfect treat to Tom to see her with her brows knit, and her rosy lips pursed up, kneading away at the crust, rolling it out, cutting it up into strips, lining the basin with it, shaving it off fine round the rim, chopping up the steak into small pieces, raining down pepper and salt upon them, packing them into the basin, pouring in cold water for gravy, and never venturing to steal a look in his direction, lest her gravity should be disturbed; until, at last, the basin being quite full and only wanting the <b>top</b> <b>crust,</b> she clapped her hands all covered with paste and flour, at Tom, and burst out heartily into such a charming little laugh of triumph, that the pudding need have had no other seasoning to commend it to the taste of any reasonable man on earth.|$|E
60|$|Many a good thing, however, is spoiled in the oven. We cannot but regret, for {{the sake}} of bread, that our old steady brick ovens have been almost universally {{superseded}} by those of ranges and cooking-stoves, which are infinite in their caprices, and forbid all general rules. One thing, however, may be borne in mind as a principle,--that the excellence of bread in all its varieties, plain or sweetened, depends on the perfection of its air-cells, whether produced by yeast, egg, or effervescence; that one of the objects of baking is to fix these air-cells, and that the quicker this can be done through the whole mass, the better will the result be. When cake or bread is made heavy by baking too quickly, it is because the immediate formation of the <b>top</b> <b>crust</b> hinders the exhaling of the moisture in the centre, and prevents the air-cells from cooking. The weight also of the crust pressing down on the doughy air-cells below destroys them, producing that horror of good cooks, a heavy streak. The problem in baking, then, is the quick application of heat rather below than above the loaf, and its steady continuance till all the air-cells are thoroughly dried into permanent consistency. Every housewife must watch her own oven to know how this can be best accomplished.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} these sediments were {{deposited}} the location {{was at least}} 3,000km from the Australian continent. Underneath there is no Proterozoic continental basement, instead these sediments are lying on <b>top</b> of oceanic <b>crust.</b>|$|R
25|$|The most {{important}} parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault is however not the maximum available length, but the available width because the latter varies {{by a factor}} of 20. Along converging plate margins, the dip angle of the rupture plane is very shallow, typically about 10 degrees. Thus the width of the plane within the <b>top</b> brittle <b>crust</b> of the Earth can become 50 to 100nbsp&km (Japan, 2011; Alaska, 1964), making the most powerful earthquakes possible.|$|R

60|$|If {{a critic}} should start a {{religion}} {{it would not}} have any object but to convert angels: and they wouldn't need it. The thin <b>top</b> <b>crust</b> of humanity--the cultivated--are worth pacifying, worth pleasing, worth coddling, worth nourishing and preserving with dainties and delicacies, it is true; but to be caterer to that little faction is no very dignified or valuable occupation, it seems to me; it is merely feeding the over-fed, and there must be small satisfaction in that. It is not that little minority who are already saved that are best worth trying to uplift, I should think, but the mighty mass of the uncultivated who are underneath. That mass will never see the Old Masters--that sight is for the few; but the chromo maker can lift them all one step upward toward appreciation of art; they cannot have the opera, but the hurdy-gurdy and the singing class lift them a little way toward that far light; they will never know Homer, but the passing rhymester of their day leaves them higher than he found them; they may never even hear of the Latin classics, but they will strike step with Kipling's drum-beat, and they will march; for all Jonathan Edwards's help they would die in their slums, but the Salvation Army will beguile some of them up to pure air and a cleaner life; they know no sculpture, the Venus is not even a name to them, but they are a grade higher in the scale of civilization by the ministrations of the plaster-cast than they were before it took its place upon then mantel and made it beautiful to their unexacting eyes.|$|E

50|$|Blueberry pie is a {{pie with}} a {{blueberry}} filling. Blueberry pie {{is considered one}} of the easiest pies to make because it does not require pitting or peeling of fruit.

50|$|The stuffed pizza at Giordano's has a <b>top</b> {{and bottom}} <b>crust</b> with cheese stuffed in between and {{the option of}} {{additional}} toppings in the middle such as pepperoni, Italian sausage, and spinach, while sauce and parmesan are added on <b>top</b> of the <b>crust.</b> Giordano's pizza crust is made from dough high in gluten, which takes several days to prepare. The crust {{has been described as}} being soft and flaky, while not having much flavor, with the shape being in the traditional Chicago-style. It can be ordered in several sizes, including individual sizes, though it is considered to be sufficiently filling that even smaller sizes of the pizza can be enough for more than one person. Giordano's offers special weekday lunch and that is available under $10. You can create your own combo too.|$|R
50|$|Thrifty cooks {{have been}} finding {{creative}} ways for using up stale bread since bread was invented.

5|$|Ocean tides are {{converted}} to heat by frictional {{losses in the}} oceans and their interaction with the solid bottom and with the <b>top</b> ice <b>crust.</b> In late 2008, it was suggested Jupiter may keep Europa's oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal waves on Europa because of its small but non-zero obliquity. This generates so-called Rossby waves that travel quite slowly, at just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant kinetic energy. For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3 J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand times larger {{than that of the}} flow excited by the dominant tidal forces. Dissipation of this energy could be the principal heat source of Europa's ocean.|$|R
50|$|In {{some cases}} the solid pastry top is {{replaced}} by a pastry lattice, allowing the meat filling to be seen. A recent development is to have a layer of Branston pickle inserted under the lattice crust. Occasionally the <b>top</b> <b>crust</b> is dispensed with altogether in favour of a layer of cranberries sealed into place with aspic jelly.|$|E
5000|$|At this stage, {{the thin}} dough top has a rounded, domed appearance. Pizza makers often poke {{a small hole}} {{in the top of}} the [...] "lid" [...] to allow air and steam to escape while cooking, so that the pizza does not explode. Usually, but not always, tomato sauce is ladled over the <b>top</b> <b>crust</b> before the pizza is baked.|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} {{made as a}} large tart in an open pie shell without a <b>top</b> <b>crust.</b> The filling {{consists}} of mashed sweet potatoes, milk, sugar and eggs, flavored with spices such as nutmeg. Other possible ingredients include vanilla or banana extracts. The baked custard filling may vary from a light and silky to dense, depending on the recipe's ratio of mashed potato, milk and eggs.|$|E
50|$|Apple cobbler (also {{known as}} apple slump, apple grunt, and apple pandowdy) {{is an old}} recipe in which the baked apples are <b>topped</b> with a <b>crust</b> formed of batter, pie crust or baking powder biscuit dough.

25|$|A {{fore-arc}} {{setting for}} most ophiolites also solves the otherwise-perplexing {{problem of how}} oceanic lithosphere can be emplaced on <b>top</b> of continental <b>crust.</b> It appears that continental accretion sediments, if carried by the downgoing plate into a subduction zone, will jam it up and cause subduction to cease, resulting in the rebound of the accretionary prism with fore-arc lithosphere (ophiolite) on top of it. Ophiolites with compositions comparable with hotspot-type eruptive settings or normal mid-oceanic ridge basalt are rare, and those examples are generally strongly dismembered in subduction zone accretionary complexes.|$|R
