The Australian components were assigned to RAAF Command under Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, while the American components were consolidated into the reformed Fifth Air Force under Kenney's personal command. On paper, the organization followed the orthodox pattern, consisting of V Fighter Command under Brigadier General Paul Wurtsmith, V Bomber Command under Walker, and an Air Services Command under Major General Rush B. Lincoln. But Kenney realized {{that he would have}} to maintain his headquarters near MacArthur's GHQ, which moved to Brisbane on 20 July, while the fighting was <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> in New Guinea, with the Fifth Air Force's principal forward bases around Port Moresby. Moreover, Walker's headquarters was in Townsville, as heavy and medium bombers were based there and only staged through Port Moresby. Accordingly, Kenney appointed Whitehead as deputy Fifth Air Force commander, and commander of the Advanced Echelon (ADVON) in Port Moresby.|$|E

25|$|Even {{in times}} of solar minimum, when F2 is rarely available, 10 meters still has some long {{distance}} possibilities. Sporadic E propagation can bring in signals from a hundred to many <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> Sporadic E on 10 meters is mainly a seasonal event, with late {{spring and early summer}} being prime time for the mode. A shorter, less-intense period occurs during mid-winter, often between Christmas and the new year. Other, off-peak openings may be seen almost anytime. Even during solar minimum, F2 openings often occur on transequatorial paths, for example between Europe and Southern Africa or between Pacific North America and the Eastern Pacific islands.|$|E
25|$|Earthquakes, even if {{they were}} <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> did cause strong enough {{movements}} in the magnets to negatively affect the beam quality and even disrupt it. Therefore, tiltmeters were installed on Tevatron's magnets to monitor minute movements and to help identify the cause of problems quickly. The first known earthquake to disrupt the beam was the 2002 Denali earthquake, with another collider shutdown caused by a moderate local quake on June 28, 2004. Since then, the minute seismic vibrations emanating from over 20 earthquakes were detected at the Tevatron without a shutdown, like the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, New Zealand's 2007 Gisborne earthquake, the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the 2010 Chile earthquake.|$|E

5000|$|Swells {{are often}} created by storms <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> {{nautical}} <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> {{from the beach}} where they break, and the propagation of the longest swells is only limited by shorelines. For example, swells generated in the Indian Ocean have been recorded in California after {{more than half a}} round-the-world trip. This distance allows the waves comprising the swells to be better sorted and free of [...] as they travel toward the coast. Waves generated by storm winds have the same speed and will group together and travel with each other, while others moving at even a fraction of a metre per second slower will lag behind, ultimately arriving many hours later due to the distance covered. The time of propagation from the source t is proportional to the distance X divided by the wave period T. In deep water it is [...] where g is the acceleration of gravity. For a storm located 10000 km away, swells with a period T=15 s will arrive 10 days after the storm, followed by 14 s swells another 17 hours later, and so forth.|$|R
25|$|The {{nation was}} still young indeed {{even after the}} end of the Civil War: California had only {{recently}} become a State, committing to the side of the victorious Union and contributing its men though the conflict took place mainly across the continent, <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> It was then only fitting that to California the Fraternities should next have moved. Pioneers in many initiatives, Zeta Psi was the first fraternity west of the Mississippi river and hence also the first to establish a chapter on the West Coast: in 1870 it established the Iota chapter at the University of California, Berkeley. (Though the Iota chapter would not be joined until 1892 by the next addition, the Mu chapter at Stanford University).|$|E
25|$|Ellen Stanton loathed the idea. In California Edwin {{would be}} <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from her {{for what was}} sure to be months, leaving her lonely in Washington, where she had few friends. Moreover, on May 9, 1857 Ellen had a {{daughter}} whom the Stantons name Eleanor Adams. After the girl's delivery, Ellen fell ill, which frightened Edwin and delayed his {{decision to go to}} California. In October 1857 Stanton finally agreed to represent the Buchanan administration's interests in California. Having agreed to a compensation of $25,000, Stanton set sail from New York on February 19, 1858 aboard the Star of the West, along with his son Eddie, James Buchanan, Jr., the President's nephew, and Lieutenant H. N. Harrison, who was assigned to Stanton's detail by the Navy. After a tempestuous voyage, the company docked in Kingston, Jamaica, where slavery was disallowed. On the island, the climate pleased Stanton greatly, and at a church there, Stanton was surprised to see blacks and whites sitting together. Afterwards, Stanton and his entourage landed in Panama, and left there on a ship three times larger than the one on which they came, the Sonora. On March 19 the company finally docked in San Francisco, and bunkered at the International Hotel.|$|E
500|$|In March 1930, Garrett {{was posted}} as adjutant/quartermaster to the 3rd Light Horse Regiment at Mount Gambier, South Australia. As a speaker at Mount Gambier's Anzac Day commemorations on 25 April 1934, he was {{reported}} as {{warning of the}} poor state of Australia's preparedness for war, admonishing: [...] "We shall {{not have the time}} that we had before the last war, and we shall not be fighting for our homes <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> We shall be fighting at our own back door. That is what we have to prepare for." [...] In August that year he was transferred to the 4th Light Horse Regiment at Warrnambool, Victoria, as adjutant/quartermaster. Garrett was posted to the staff of Army Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1936, and departed for England in November the following year to attend the Staff College, Camberley. He was promoted to major in July 1938, and returned to Australia upon the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
2500|$|Gavin {{took his}} first job as a {{newspaper}} delivery boy {{at the age of}} 10. By the age of 11, he had two routes and was an agent for three out-of-town papers. During this time, he enjoyed following articles about World War I. In the eighth grade, he moved on from the paper job and started working at a barbershop. There he listened to the stories of the old miners. This led him to realize {{he did not want to}} be a miner. In school, he learned about the Civil War. From that point on, he decided to study everything he could about the subject. He was amazed at what he discovered and decided if he wanted to learn this [...] "magic" [...] <b>of</b> controlling <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> troops, from <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> he would have to continue his education at the United States Military Academy at West Point.|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} {{evolving}} technology, capabilities of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) s are increasing rapidly. This development provides UAVs {{to be used}} in many different areas. One of these areas is CAS (Close Air Support) mission. UAVs have several advantages compared to manned aircraft, however there are also some problematic areas. The remote controlling of these vehicles from <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> nautical <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> via satellite may lead to various problems both ethical and tactical aspects. Therefore, CAS missions require a good level of ALI (Air-Land Integration), a high SA (situational awareness) and precision engagement. In fact, there is an aware friendly element in the target area in CAS missions, unlike the other UAV operations. This element is an Airman called JTAC (Joint Terminal Attack Controller). Unlike the JTAC, UAV operators are too far away from target area and use the limited FOV (Field of View) provided by camera and some other sensor data. In this study, target area situational awareness of a UAV operator and a JTAC, in a high-risk mission for friendly ground forces and civilians such as CAS, are compared. As a result of this comparison, answer to the question who should control the UCAV (Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle) in which circumstances is sought. A literature review is made in UAV and CAS fields and recent air operations are examined. The control of UCAV by the JTAC is assessed by SWOT analysis and as a result it is deduced that both control methods can be used in different situations {{within the framework of the}} ROE (Rules Of Engagement) is reached...|$|R
5000|$|Citizens Band {{radio is}} a family of {{services}} available in different countries and with different operating rules, generally using channels in the 27 MHz part of the radio spectrum. 26-27 MHz occupies the [...] "boundary area" [...] between HF (3-30 MHz) and VHF (30-300 MHz). This means that CB signals provide local coverage similar to low-band VHF during times of low sunspot activity. However, during {{the peak of the}} sunspot cycle, CB frequencies exhibit skywave propagation just like the lower parts of HF do, making communication hundreds or even <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> (km) <b>away</b> possible. While some operators seek out long distance [...] "DX" [...] contacts on CB frequencies and on frequencies above channel 40 and below channel 1 (a practice referred to as [...] "freebanding" [...] or [...] "outbanding"), interference from distant stations will often make local communication extremely difficult or impossible during band openings. CB was, and still is, designed for short-distance (local) communications needs. US FCC law prohibits communicating with any station more than 250 km (155.3 miles) on CB frequencies. Like many rules regarding the HF CB services, the distance prohibition is largely ignored and unenforced. Often as a result of channel overcrowding and interference, many HF CB users have turned to purchasing [...] "export" [...] or [...] "10-meter" [...] radios that operate in the legal CB band but also provide access to frequencies above and below the CB band. Other CB users purchase amplifiers to increase their output power and [...] "punch through" [...] interference caused by distant stations (or by local stations running amplifiers). This has created a tragedy of the commons situation in and near the HF CB spectrum (25-28 MHz). As more users purchase amplifiers and operate on out-of-band frequencies, more interference is produced, forcing others to acquire even more powerful equipment to punch through even more interference, and/or to acquire transceivers capable of accessing more frequencies so that a clear frequency may be found. Many CB users have moved to other personal radio services to avoid these issues.|$|R

2500|$|The {{ionosphere}} is {{a region}} of the upper atmosphere, from about 80km to 1000km in altitude, where neutral air is ionized by solar photons and cosmic rays. When high frequency signals enter the ionosphere obliquely, they are back-scattered from the ionized layer as scatter waves. If the midlayer ionization is strong enough compared to the signal frequency, a scatter wave can exit {{the bottom of the}} layer earthwards as if reflected from a mirror. Earth's surface (ground or water) then diffusely reflects the incoming wave back towards the ionosphere. Consequently, like a rock [...] "skipping" [...] across water, the signal may effectively [...] "bounce" [...] or [...] "skip" [...] between the earth and ionosphere two or more times (multihop propagation). Since at shallow incidence losses remain quite small, signals of only a few watts can sometimes be received many <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> as a result.
