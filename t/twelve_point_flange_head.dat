40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} on axially loaded columns, made of fiber-reinforced composite materials are presented. Experimental load/deflection plots at <b>twelve</b> <b>flange</b> <b>points</b> and three web points allow for an accurate description ofthe deformations, including the post-critical behavior. Data processing by two methods is described and a comparison is {{made between the}} two methods. In one method, the incipient buckling data are used, while in the second method, the post buckling data are used. The effect of damage accumulation is illustrated. The beha~ vior, including the curvature of the post-critical path, is predicted by using stability theory. Comparisons between predicted and measured values of critical load and postcritical path curvature are presented. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
