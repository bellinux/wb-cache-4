25|$|Population-based {{studies of}} KLS {{have not been}} performed. Its {{prevalence}} is about 1 case per million people. In France, KLS has a prevalence of 1.5 per million people. It occurs most frequently among Jews in the US and Israel. First-degree relatives {{of people who have}} suffered from the syndrome are much more likely <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population</b> to suffer from it, although only in about one percent of cases do family members contract it. About 70 to 90 percent of patients are male. Patients with the syndrome are more likely <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population</b> to have genetic disorders, and about a third of people with the syndrome encountered some form of birth difficulty. In a study of 186 older patients, about ten percent had preexisting psychiatric issues. One study found that about ten percent of patients had a neurological condition before KLS developed. The condition does not appear to occur most frequently in one season.|$|E

25|$|Demographically, Nordling et al.'s (2006) {{study found}} no {{differences}} in age, but 43% of gay male respondents compared to 29% of straight males had university level education.

Because there were not enough female respondents (22), no conclusions could be drawn from them.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that younger voters tend to vote mostly for Democratic {{candidates}} in recent years. Despite supporting Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, the young have {{voted in favor of}} the Democratic presidential candidate in every election since Bill Clinton in 1992, {{and are more likely to}} identify as liberals <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population.</b> In the 2004 presidential election, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry received 54% of the vote from voters of the age group 18–29, while Republican George W. Bush received 45% of the vote from the same age group. In the 2006 midterm elections, the Democrats received 60% of the vote from the same age group. Polls suggest that younger voters tend to be more liberal <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population</b> and have more liberal views than the public on same-sex marriage and universal healthcare, helping Barack Obama carry 66% of their votes in 2008. The Young Democrats of America are an affiliated organization of members of the party younger than 36 that advocates for youth issues and works for youth voter turnout.|$|E

In 2015 Dameyon Bonson established Black Rainbow as a mental health support and suicide prevention service for LGBTI indigenous Australians, given that they often suffer both racism and homophobia/transphobia, and additionally are 45 times more likely to commit suicide <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that heterozygote carriers of the Wilson's disease gene mutation may be potentially more susceptible to elevated copper intake <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population.</b> A heterozygotic frequency of 1/90 people has been estimated in the overall population. However, {{there is no evidence to}} support this speculation. Further, a review of the data on single-allelic autosomal recessive diseases in humans does not suggest that heterozygote carriers are likely to be adversely affected by their altered genetic status.|$|E

It has also been found that 13-15 percent of youth in detention identify as LGBT, whereas an estimated 4-8 percent of the general youth population identify as such.|$|E
25|$|The {{conditions}} affecting {{homeless people}} are somewhat specialized and have {{opened a new}} area of medicine tailored to this population. Skin conditions, including scabies, are common because homeless people are exposed to extreme cold {{in the winter and}} they have little access to bathing facilities. They have problems caring for their feet and have more severe dental problems <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population.</b> Diabetes, especially untreated, is widespread in the homeless population. Specialized medical textbooks have been written to address this for providers.|$|E
25|$|Psychological factors, {{stressful}} life events, life transitions, and environment {{as well as}} often thinking {{in a way that}} exaggerates relatively normal bodily reactions are also believed {{to play a role in}} the onset of panic disorder. Often the first attacks are triggered by physical illnesses, major stress, or certain medications. People who tend to take on excessive responsibilities may develop a tendency to suffer panic attacks. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients also show a much higher rate of panic disorder <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{audit of}} one years' {{work at a}} {{voluntary}} health care service for the homeless involving doctors, a chiropodist, nurses and social workers was carried out.

However, registration with general practitioners was much less common among <b>the</b> homeless <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population,</b> and {{a high proportion of}} referrals to hospital did not lead to appropriate treatment. The value of a special primary health care service for the homeless is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Little {{was known}} about work {{situation}} and work-related difficulties, including housework after stomach cancer diagnosis. We aimed to compare employment status and work-related difficulties between stomach cancer survivors and <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population.</b> We enrolled 408 stomach cancer survivors from two hospitals 28 months after diagnosis and 994 representative volunteers from <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population</b> from 15 geographic districts. Working was defined as being employed (including self-employed) and nonworking as being retired or a homemaker. Nonworking was significantly higher among stomach cancer survivors (46. 6 %) <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population</b> (36. 5 %). Compared with <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population,</b> <b>the</b> survivors had more fatigue in performing both housework (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2. 08; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) = 1. 01 – 4. 29) and gainful work (aOR= 4. 02; 2. 55 – 6. 33). More cancer survivors had reduced working hours (aOR= 1. 42; 95 % CI= 4. 60 – 28. 35) and reduced work-related ability (aOR= 6. 11; 95 % CI= 3. 64 – 10. 27) <b>than</b> did <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population.</b> <b>The</b> association of nonworking with older age and being female was significantly more positive for survivors <b>than</b> for <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population.</b> Among survivors, poorer Eastern Cooperation Oncology Group Performance Status and receiving total gastrectomy were positively associated with nonworking. Stomach cancer survivors experienced more difficulties in both housework and gainful employment <b>than</b> did <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population.</b> Our findings on stomach cancer survivors' work-related difficulties and the predictors of nonworking will help physicians guide patients towards more realistic postsurgical employment plans...|$|R
