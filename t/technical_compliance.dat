[...] Edmunds.com did note that switching to neutral was the best option, given that average drivers may not press the brakes as firmly, and lighter presses will simply wear the brakes down. The German Commission on <b>Technical</b> <b>Compliance</b> (TÜV) of Rheinland also tested the stopping distance of Toyota iQ, Aygo, Yaris, Auris, Verso, Avensis and RAV4 models. With the accelerator purposely jammed to 80% of maximum speed, each vehicle was able to brake safely to a halt. The TÜV findings indicated that each model met the legal requirements for deceleration and stopping distances, and that all Toyota models tested had brakes which could override a stuck accelerator.|$|E

In most of the cases, the proposed technical solutions are often chosen mainly based on the initial acquisition cost, <b>technical</b> <b>compliances</b> and previous experiences. The complete life cycle cost, which shall typically include solution integration, operation and maintenance cost are often neglected. It is important to consider the complete life cycle cost as much as possible.
