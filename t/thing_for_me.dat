25|$|The {{concept of}} {{communication}} with an audience became a big <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> at the time. The reason I was using that concept so much {{at that point in}} my life – in 1968, 1969 or so – was because it was a discovery for me. I grew up kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.|$|E

But it was such an amazing <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to come in to make this broken-down picture, and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.|$|E

[...] In medical terminology, a [...] "no code" [...] order {{is a medical}} order to withhold CPR on a patient. It {{is also known as}} a [...] "do not resuscitate" [...] order. In another interview, Vedder said that [...] "if the record is a complete failure you've kind of owned up to it in a subliminal way. No Code was the same <b>thing.</b> <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> No Code meant 'Do Not Resuscitate'." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 1952, Kennan made a {{statement}} that cost him his ambassadorship. In an {{answer to a question}} at a press conference, Kennan compared his conditions at the ambassador's residence in Moscow to those he had encountered while interned in Berlin during {{the first few months of}} the Second World War. While his statement was not unfounded, the Soviets interpreted it as an implied analogy with Nazi Germany. The Soviets then declared Kennan persona non grata and refused to allow him to re-enter the USSR. Kennan acknowledged retrospectively that it was a [...] "foolish <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to have said".|$|E
500|$|Bergkamp {{attracted}} the attention of several European clubs {{as a result of his}} performances for Ajax. Johan Cruyff advised him not to join Real Madrid, one of the teams said to have been interested in him. But Bergkamp was insistent on playing in Italy. He considered Serie A [...] "the biggest league at the time" [...] and preferred a move to either Juventus or Internazionale. On 16 February 1993, Bergkamp agreed a £7.1million move to the latter club in a deal which included his Ajax teammate Wim Jonk. Upon signing, Bergkamp said Inter [...] "met all my demands. The most important <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> was the stadium, the people at the club and their style of play." ...|$|E

A guy that's been a lifer in prison has a different attitude toward life and death." [...] Other influences included Tony Todd, who had appeared as a Hirogen in the fourth season episode [...] "", and Hertzler subsequently compared the costumes that he and Todd wore in their roles, saying [...] "The frustrating <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> was that Tony got to wear shoulder pads, a huge chest piece, a fabulous helmet. I didn't get any of that. I was in a skintight rubber suit. Had I been 23, I would have been much happier, but at 49?" ...|$|E

500|$|His form in {{the tour}} to the West Indies in March and April 2004 was mixed. After several low scores in the Test series—Trescothick started with only 20 runs from his first five innings—he reached two half-centuries, but failed to make a {{substantial}} match-winning contribution. This poor touring form {{may have been the}} start of the troubles that would rule him out of international cricket in the future. Trescothick said, [...] "The hardest <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> has been the pitches. So far nets and the matches have been on average surfaces and runs have been hard work...In England you get used to good practice surfaces so the rhythm of batting comes pretty easy [...]" [...] However, he topped the England batting averages in the 7-match one-day series, with 267 runs including 130 in the 5th ODI and 82 from 57 balls in the 7th.|$|E
500|$|Some modern authors {{suggest that}} Druitt was {{dismissed}} {{because he was}} a homosexual or pederast and that may have driven him to suicide. One speculation is that the money found on his body was going to be used for payment to a blackmailer. Others, however, think that {{there is no evidence of}} homosexuality and that his suicide was instead precipitated by an hereditary psychiatric illness. His mother suffered from depression and was institutionalised from July 1888. She died in an asylum in Chiswick in 1890. His maternal grandmother committed suicide while insane, his aunt attempted suicide., and his eldest sister committed suicide in old age. A note written by Druitt and addressed to his brother William, who was a solicitor in Bournemouth, was found in Druitt's room in Blackheath. It read, [...] "Since Friday I felt that I was going to be like mother, and the best <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> was to die." ...|$|E
500|$|After the filming, Burton {{said of the}} cast, [...] "All I can say is {{this is one of}} {{the best}} casts I've ever worked with. These people are not {{professional}} singers, so to do a musical like this which I think is one of the most difficult musicals, they all went for it. Every day on the set was a very, very special <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> Hearing all these guys sing, I don't know if I can ever have an experience like that again."" [...] Burton said of the singing, [...] "You can't just lip synch, you'd see the throat and the breath, every take they all had to belt it out. It was very enjoyable for me to see, with music on the set everybody just moved differently. I'd seen Johnny (Depp) act in a way I'd never seen before, walking across the room or sitting in the chair, picking up a razor or making a pie, whatever. They all did it in a way that you could sense." ...|$|E

500|$|Stewart served {{not only}} as host {{but also as a}} writer and {{executive}} producer of the series. [...] He recalls that he initially struggled with the Kilborn holdover writers to gain control of the show and put his own imprint on the show's voice, a struggle that led to the departure of a number of the holdover writers. Instrumental in shaping the voice of the show under Stewart was former editor of The Onion Ben Karlin who, along with fellow Onion contributor David Javerbaum, joined the staff in 1999 as head writer and was later promoted to executive producer. Their experience in writing for the satirical newspaper, which uses fake stories to mock real print journalism and current events, would influence the comedic direction of the show; Stewart recalls the hiring of Karlin as the point at which things [...] " [...] to take shape". Describing his approach to the show, Karlin said, [...] "The main <b>thing,</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> is seeing hypocrisy. People who know better saying things that you know they don't believe." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 2010, it was {{announced}} that three new characters; Doug Harris (Mahesh Jadu), Michael Williams (Sandy Winton) and Natasha Williams were to join Neighbours in the following months. Novakovic, a performing arts college graduate, was cast in the role of Natasha. The actress had been studying architecture at university, before she chose to move into acting. Shortly after her casting {{was announced}}, Novakovic revealed that the role of Natasha was her first acting job and that while she would always be interested in architecture, she really wanted to enjoy the experience on Neighbours. Novakovic moved from Sydney to Melbourne, where Neighbours is filmed, for the role. She is three years older than the character she portrays. In 2011, Novakovic revealed she is still happy with the career choice she made, stating [...] "I enjoy what I'm doing now a lot more than studying, because this is where I want to be. [...] The best <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> is that I enjoy going to work every day and have some great friends there, including the crew. It's awesome to do something you love every single day." ...|$|E
500|$|Lowe and Hanton busked {{through the}} song, which {{was cut short}} by Phillips waving his hands to {{indicate}} that the cutting needle was getting close to the centre of the acetate. He then handed the band a fragile 78rpm 10-inch acetate record. It was later lost until Lowe rediscovered it in 1981, and planned to put it up for auction at Sotheby's, but sold it to McCartney for an undisclosed amount. McCartney later had the two songs digitally re-mastered and pressed 50 copies, giving them to friends as a Christmas present, although the two songs were released on 21 November 1995, as part of The Beatles Anthology (Anthology 1). McCartney later said, [...] "The strangest <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> listening to it, is that it's like drowning, it's like your life flashing by in front of you. From the earliest things by me and John when we used to sag off school and the earliest demo tape we ever made, to the first little record we made which was a version of John singing [...] "That'll Be The Day", and a little song of mine [...] on the other side that's never been released before." ...|$|E

500|$|Damien Leith stated how {{his debut}} studio album wanted to pan out: [...] "I didn't {{really want to}} do anybody else's songs... I just wanted this album to be mine". Immediately after Australian Idol concluded, he {{convinced}} the producers of the show to break from protocol by giving him longer time to record the album. The protocol was that the Australian Idol winners had only one week after the competition ended to record their first album. He decided to work on his first studio album for the next few months. Leith was aware of the little success of the previous two Idol winners, Casey Donovan and Kate DeAraugo, so he decided to turn something more palpable than the previous winners by producing an album of original songs. He comments, [...] "I suppose the main <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> was trying to establish myself as a songwriter out of it because that's something that hasn't really been promoted in the past." [...] He was determined to create as much original material as possible for the album, and create songs that truly represent who he was. He also wanted the themes in the lyrics to not only be personal, but broad enough so that listeners can relate to them.|$|E
500|$|Produced {{independently}} by Ecosse, Becoming Jane {{was given}} a limited budget of €12.7 million (£9 million or $16.5 million). Production designer Eve Stewart researched Regency literature and Austen's life, and along with Jarrold, scouted locations in Dublin and nearby counties for five weeks in January and February 2006. They ultimately opted to shoot in Dublin and the Irish counties of Meath and Wicklow instead of Hampshire, the birthplace of Austen, because it held [...] "a sense of countryside that felt more unchanged," [...] while Hampshire had unfortunately become too [...] "groomed and manicured". Jarrold also found [...] "a great variety of Georgian houses and older houses" [...] in Ireland. His production received funds from the Irish Film Board, the UK Film Council Premiere Fund, 2 Entertain, Scion Films, and Miramax Films. Film critic Andrew Sarris noted that in Ireland [...] "happily, there are still architectural traces of life more than 200 years ago to correspond with the year 1795." [...] However, Ireland did include a few disadvantages: Stewart found that [...] "the rural aspects were the most difficult as the Irish country landscape is nothing like Hampshire. There are no rolling hills so the vegetation and the landscaping was the trickiest <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> as a production designer." ...|$|E
500|$|Burton {{revealed}} that Dylan is [...] "a lot more" [...] like himself. [...] "Jason was so stoic and didn't {{really get to}} show a lot of personality, unless it was with Spinelli or Sam," [...] he said. Dylan {{has a sense of}} humor, and the actor felt that it would bring out a [...] "lighter side" [...] of his acting. In addition to his [...] "entire makeover" [...] which included a new hairstyle, Burton lost weight to play Dylan, as the costume department wanted him to look younger. Burton admitted during an interview with Entertainment Weekly that he was worried about how Dylan would be received, considering the [...] "persona" [...] of Jason is out there; he hoped [...] "people will buy" [...] Dylan, although some people would say [...] "You are Jason and that's it." [...] Burton told Yahoo! that: [...] " [...] extremely different. That's the biggest <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> that after playing a character, which I loved, for 21 years, coming here and trying to do something different - 'cause I know fans are always gonna see me as that character if they watch the show and if they watch both shows... So, it's definitely a challenge because I was so used to playing that character." [...] Jason's [...] "confined" [...] ways allowed Dylan to have a [...] "little more" [...] of Burton's own personality.|$|E
