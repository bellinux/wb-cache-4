5|$|Philosophy of {{psychiatry}} explores philosophical questions relating to psychiatry and mental illness. The philosopher {{of science and}} medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy {{of psychiatry}}. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the philosophy of mind and psychopathology.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{articulated}} his {{own beliefs}} about religion as well. He did not {{subscribe to the}} view religious feeling was primarily a social need, believing {{it to be a}} need for seeing a cause and logic to the world along with a harmony to things. A believer in dualism, he held the theory of a separate biological psyche and something beyond it. To him the most important aspects of the psyche lay beyond objective science, at least in his time. He sought to explore those boundaries where the methods of science had to stop and declare what was beyond as unknown, limited by <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> times. In The Psychology of the Religious Life he laid out his definition of religion as an appreciative feeling toward an unseen entity marked the best or the greatest.|$|E

Similar to the blues, shanties often {{exhibited}} {{a string of}} such verses without much explicit or continuous theme. While on one hand this may simply reflect the aesthetic of the music-culture from which the form originated, this, too, was a feature suited to practical restrictions. Work tasks might be of any length and often unpredictable. Songs with a fixed set of verses, or ballads, which tell a story, were not so well suited to tasks that could end abruptly at any time or that might require extending.|$|E

25|$|The Ptolemaic {{approach}} of using cycles and epicycles was becoming strained: {{there seemed to}} be no end to the mushrooming growth in complexity required to account for the observable phenomena. Johannes Kepler was the first person to abandon <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ptolemaic paradigm. He started to explore the possibility that the planet Mars might have an elliptical orbit rather than a circular one. Clearly, the angular velocity could not be constant, but it proved very difficult to find the formula describing the rate of change of the planet's angular velocity. After many years of calculations, Kepler arrived at what we now know as the law of equal areas.|$|E
25|$|During {{the recent}} history of the grindadráp, <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> catch have modernized. Cellular {{telephones}} and radio allow the islands to be alerted to a sighting within the course of minutes. The use of private motorboats gives the whalers more speed and maneuverability on the water. The dull blowhole hook, adopted in response to concerns over cruelty, had the additional effect of further increasing the effectiveness of Faroese attempting to beach the whales. In spite of how such improvements to the tools could make the grindadráp more effective, the number of pilot whales caught, both overall and per whale drive, is less than in preceding centuries.|$|E

2500|$|Polk's {{historic}} {{reputation was}} largely {{formed by the}} attacks made on him in his own time. Whig politicians claimed that he was drawn from a well-deserved obscurity. Sam Houston {{is said to have}} observed that Polk was [...] "a victim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> water as a beverage". Senator Tom Corwin of Ohio remarked [...] "James K. Polk, of Tennessee? After that, who is safe?" [...] <b>The</b> Republican historians <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century inherited this view. Polk was a compromise between <b>the</b> Democrats <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North, like David Wilmot and Silas Wright, and Southern plantation owners led by John C. Calhoun. The Northern Democrats thought that when they did not get their way, it was because he was <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slaveholders, and <b>the</b> conservatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South insisted that he was <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern Democrats. These views were long reflected in the historical literature, until Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and Bernard De Voto argued that Polk was nobody's tool, but set his own goals and achieved them.|$|R

Maine's Whig governor, Edward Kent, granted Dow a colonel's commission in the state militia in 1841 {{as a reward for}} his efforts, despite his lack of military experience. Nevertheless, Dow did not consider himself [...] "a party man in the politician's understanding of the term," [...] and had no qualms about encouraging his supporters to vote against any Whig whom he considered insufficiently anti-alcohol.|$|E

500|$|Also {{impressed}} with the song's musical moods, Ian Inglis writes: [...] "The switches between periods of pulsating rhythm and interludes of musical calm echo {{the ebb and flow}} of seduction itself. Like a painter who uses contrasting colors to create tension and movement, Harrison is... using <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songwriter to create a dynamic and passionate depiction of lust and desire." [...] Madinger and Easter describe the track as [...] "an absolutely apocalyptic production" [...] and [...] "the best example of Spector running rampant with the 'Wall of Sound'". Writing in his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Richard Williams views [...] "Let It Down" [...] as [...] "the record's most thrilling track", adding that it [...] "picks the listener up and, in the best Spector tradition, never lets him down, building an electrifying tension between the subdued, reverential verses and the roaring chorus". In September 2014, the song appeared as Harrison's selection on the solo Beatles EP , exclusive to iTunes.|$|E

[...] (1893-1952), the Assistant Director of the Extension Department under Coady, rose to national leadership in the Union in 1945, from whence he led an increasing international engagement on behalf of Canadians. Coady described MacDonald as a brilliant man, capable of organizing and maintaining a far-flung network of study clubs and cooperatives, who had a “keen and penetrating mind, always ahead of the people yet practical enough to keep within the range of what was possible. He was radical enough in other words to be progressive, and, conservative enough to be sane.” ...|$|E

Bigelow teased his friend about his British-style pith helmet. He gave his friend a quiver of Apache hunting arrows and its bow that he had recovered from the field. Remington made dozens of sketches that often focused on what Bigelow did and often inserted himself in his own sketches. In 1889 Remington would publish some of his sketches and tell {{of what it was}} like going on a [...] "scout" [...] with the Buffalo Soldiers. The tall lean frame and face of Bigelow can be seen in many of Remington's later paintings and artistic works. Unfortunately this caused some problems for Bigelow. Not only did some officers become jealous of the attention given to Bigelow, but many women, married and single, competed for his attention. Bigelow had many a close call toward the state of matrimony, but improved his Spanish skills. On at least two occasions his [...] "notoriety" [...] caused him delay in returning to his command because of the [...] "need" [...] for him to attend a party while in transit at some frontier posting.|$|E
