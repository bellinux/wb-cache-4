5|$|Radio {{stations}} in the United States often broadcast popular music. Each music station has a format, or a category of songs to be played; these are generally similar to but {{not the same as}} ordinary generic classification. Many radio {{stations in}} the United States are locally owned and operated, and may offer an eclectic assortment of recordings; many other stations are owned by large companies like Clear Channel, and are generally formatted on smaller, more repetitive playlists. Commercial sales of recordings are <b>tracked</b> <b>by</b> Billboard magazine, which compiles a number of music charts for various fields of recorded music sales. The Billboard Hot 100 is the top pop music chart for singles, a recording consisting of a handful of songs; longer pop recordings are albums, and are <b>tracked</b> <b>by</b> the Billboard 200. Though recorded music is commonplace in American homes, many of the music industry's revenue comes from a small number of devotees; for example, 62% of album sales come from less than 25% of the music-buying audience. Total CD sales in the United States topped 705 million units sold in 2005, and singles sales just under three million.|$|E
5|$|Sprint was {{the primary}} weapon of Nike-X as {{originally}} conceived; {{it would have been}} placed in clusters around the targets being defended by the MAR system. Each missile was housed in an underground silo and was driven into the air before launch by a gas-powered piston. The missile was initially <b>tracked</b> <b>by</b> the local MSR, which would hand off tracking to the MAR as soon as it became visible. A transponder in the missile could respond to signals from either the MAR or MSR for accurate tracking.|$|E
5|$|The 1993 North Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} the quietest on {{record in the}} basin, with only five {{tropical}} disturbances, {{one of which was}} a reformation of another system.

5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone was first observed on September 1 off the southeast {{coast of the}} United States. Initially, it {{was believed to be}} the same storm that struck Guadeloupe on the same day, though subsequent research indicated there were two separate storms. The hurricane <b>tracked</b> <b>by</b> the Bahamas while tracking generally northward, and it attained major hurricane status over the western Atlantic Ocean. As it approached the United States coastline, the hurricane was very intense, with winds estimated at over 135 mph (215 km/h) and potentially as strong as 160 mph (260 km/h), or a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Late on September 2, the hurricane made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina and later turned to the northeast to cross the Pamlico Sound.|$|E
