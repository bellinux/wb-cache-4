5|$|In 1780, {{the society}} moved again, {{this time to}} Somerset House. The {{property}} was offered to the society by His Majesty's Government and, as soon as Sir Joseph Banks became president in November 1778, he began planning the move. Somerset House, while larger than Crane Court, was not satisfying to the fellows; the room <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>the</b> library was too small, the accommodation was insufficient {{and there was not}} enough room <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>the</b> museum at all. As a result, the museum was handed to the British Museum in 1781 and the library was extended to two rooms, one of which was used for council meetings.|$|E

5|$|A MOS Technology 6502 {{chip that}} {{operates}} at 894kHz generates the sound effects, and a speech synthesizer by Votrax generates Q*bert's incoherent expressions. The audio system uses 128B of random-access memory and 4KB of erasable programmable {{read only memory}} <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>the</b> sound data and code to implement it. Like other Gottlieb games, the sound system was thoroughly tested to ensure it would handle daily usage. In retrospect, audio engineer David Thiel commented that such testing minimized time available for creative designing.|$|E
5|$|In 1621, a {{subcommittee}} of the House of Lords concluded that the Lords' record keeping should be improved, and the tower was renovated to improve its storage facilities. The {{first floor of the}} tower, used <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>the</b> documents, was renovated with brick vaulting, providing better fire protection than the original wooden ceiling, by Thomas Hicks at a cost of £6. The chamber was further protected by a new iron door.|$|E
5|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>the</b> {{high level}} {{radioactive}} waste in long-term geological depositories, specific waste forms {{need to be}} used which will allow the radioactivity to decay away while the materials retain their integrity for thousands of years.

5|$|Older Macintoshes {{dating from}} 1983 until 1998 {{utilized}} a basic bootloader; the bootloader was solely a ROM chip varying in sizes up to 4megabytes (MB), which contained both the computer code to boot {{the computer and}} to run the Mac OS operating system. This {{was known as the}} Macintosh Toolbox, or the Old World ROM, and differs greatly from design the modern Macintosh which generally use a hard drive of large capacity <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>the</b> operating system. This bootloader was used in all Macintosh computers until mid-1998.|$|E

The Main Line and its connections to other subway lines was to have cost $213,950,000, while the future Bronx extension would have cost $130,160,000.|$|E
5|$|The genital {{openings}} (gonopores) of {{both sexes}} are located {{on the underside of}} the third body segment (near the second pair of legs) and may be accompanied in the male by one or two penes which deposit the sperm packets onto the gonopods. In the female, the genital pores open into paired small sacs called cyphopods or vulvae, which are covered by small hood-like lids, and are used <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>the</b> sperm after copulation. The cyphopod morphology can also be used to identify species. Millipede sperm lack flagella, a unique trait among myriapods.|$|E

5|$|Aalborg had a synagogue, {{built in}} 1854; and the Jewish rabbi Salomon Mielziner served it for 35 years. Services {{were no longer}} offered after Mielziner died, and in 1924 the synagogue was donated to the city government, which began using it <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>the</b> city {{archives}} (Stadsarkivet). It was burned down by the Schalburg Corps in April 1945 {{towards the end of}} World War II, destroying its centuries-old Torahs. Anti-semitism continues to exist in Denmark, and in 1999, an unlicensed Nazi radio station began operating from a neo-Nazi stronghold in Fynen, Nørresundby, within Aalborg municipality. The activity has been widely denounced with organized opposition in Aalborg and the rest of Denmark, and in February 1999, 12 anti-fascists were arrested for possession of explosives at their base in Fynen.|$|E
5|$|Chard was a {{key point}} on the Taunton Stop Line, a World War II {{defensive}} line consisting of pillboxes and anti-tank obstacles, which runs from Axminster north to the Somerset coast near Highbridge. In 1938 a bomb proof bunker was built behind the branch of the Westminster Bank. During the war {{it was used to}} hold duplicate copies of the bank records in case its headquarters in London was destroyed. It was also used <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>the</b> emergency bank note supply of the Bank of England. There has also been speculation that the Crown Jewels were also stored there, however this has never been confirmed.|$|E

5|$|In April 2005, New York {{reached a}} {{settlement}} with Super Steel to close the rehabilitation project for $5.5 million, requiring them to stop work on the project, cover remaining costs, and move four unfinished trains into storage at a nearby industrial park. This settlement, when added to the $64.8 million previously spent, brought total project expenses—the results of which were three rehabilitated trainsets and four others {{in various states of}} repair—to $70.3 million. In 2007, Amtrak and New York settled their own lawsuit, with Amtrak paying New York $20 million. Amtrak and New York further agreed to commit $10 million each to implement track improvements in the Empire Corridor. New York, which was paying $150,000 per year <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>the</b> unused trains, auctioned off its four surplus Turboliners in 2012 for $420,000, including spare parts; scrapping began in 2013.|$|E
5|$|In a {{practical}} implementation, the variables {{used to represent}} the indices will often be of fixed size, and this can result in an arithmetic overflow for very large arrays. If {{the midpoint of the}} span is calculated as (L + R) / 2, then the value of L + R may exceed the range of integers of the data type used <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>the</b> midpoint, even if L and R are within the range. If L and R are nonnegative, this can be avoided by calculating the midpoint as L + (R minus& L) / 2.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of the Cunard Building are the large basement and sub-basement levels that initially acted as storage facilities for both the Company's property and also the luggage of passengers. Coal was also stored in the basement, with a small railway track providing {{a link to the}} boiler room, which was used to heat the building. Many original features of the basement still exist, including the timber baggage racks, ship logs and other maritime documents. Several secure vaults, which in the past were used <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>the</b> most valuable passenger items, are still used today to hold historic documents, drawings and blueprints relating to the Cunard Building and also some of Cunard's Liners, such as the RMS Queen Mary.|$|E

5|$|Several {{other rooms}} {{neighbored}} the sanctuary. Many of these rooms {{were used to}} store ceremonial equipment, ritual texts, or temple valuables; others had specific ritual functions. The room where offerings {{were given to the}} deity was often separate from the sanctuary itself, and in temples without a barque in the sanctuary, there was a separate shrine <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>the</b> barque. In late temples the ritual areas could extend to chapels on the roof and crypts below the floor. Finally, in the exterior wall {{at the back of the}} temple, there were often niches for laymen to pray to the temple god, as close as they could come to its dwelling place.|$|E
5|$|The Adbhuta Ramayana narrates: Ravana used <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>the</b> {{blood of}} sages he {{killed in a}} large pot. The sage Gritsamada was {{practicing}} penance to acquire the goddess Lakshmi as his daughter. He stored milk from Darbha grass and purified it with mantras in a pot so that Lakshmi would inhabit it. Ravana poured the milk from this pot into his blood pot. Mandodari is frustrated seeing the evil deeds of Ravana, so she decides to commit suicide by drinking {{the contents of the}} blood-pot, which is described to be more poisonous than poison. Instead of dying, Mandodari gets pregnant with the incarnation of Lakshmi due to the power of Gritsamada's milk. Mandodari buries the foetus in Kurukshetra, where it is discovered by Janaka, who named her Sita.|$|E
5|$|The Library of Gray's Inn {{has existed}} {{since at least}} 1555, when the first mention of it {{was made in the}} will of Robert Chaloner, who left some money to buy law books for the Library. The Library was neither a big {{collection}} nor a dedicated one; in 1568 it was being housed in a single room in the chambers of Nicholas Bacon, a room that was also used for mooting and <b>to</b> <b>store</b> <b>the</b> deed chest. The collection grew larger over the years as individual Benchers such as Sir John Finch and Sir John Bankes left books or money to buy books in their wills, and the first Librarian was appointed in 1646 after members of the Inn had been found stealing books.|$|E
