25|$|In a {{three-way}} conversation, Tafoya <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> translated between Parker and Nolan. The goals {{of all parties}} were different. Tafoya's and Parker's goal {{were the most important}} to them. And despite a history of hostility between them, Tafoya apparently agreed to mislead the soldiers for the return of his stock plus interest. He deliberately translated parts of the conversation wrong to Nolan. Somehow through the three-way conversation and translations, Nolan quickly realized that some type of deal was made between Parker and the half-breed Tafoya. At that point Nolan began to lose critical trust in his primary trail guide. And later his trust in the hunters faltered. And maybe, the men who witnessed Nolan's tirade faltered in their own trust of their commander.|$|E
25|$|Ali {{stood up}} and started towards Angelo Dundee who guided him into the corner. At first Dundee <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> slapped Ali's legs, but after Ali {{misunderstood}} {{and tried to get}} off the stool, Dundee used smelling salts. Dundee has since claimed to have opened a small tear in one of Ali's gloves and told the referee that his fighter needed a new pair of gloves, thus delaying the start of the 5th round. Cooper insisted that this delay lasted anywhere from three to five seconds according to the footage and that this did not deny him the chance to try to knock Ali out while he was still dazed. Tapes of the fight show that Ali received only an extra six seconds, and the gloves were ultimately not replaced. Cooper started the 5th round aggressively, attempting to make good on his advantage, but a recovered Ali effectively countered and Cooper was hit high on the face with a hard right which opened a severe cut under his eye. Referee Tommy Little was forced to stop the fight, and thus Ali defeated Cooper by technical knockout.|$|E

25|$|As part {{of their}} investigation, police served Verizon and AT with search {{warrants}} to obtain cell phone billing records, and took Zahau's Samsung Focus cell phone as evidence. According to Zahau's AT cell phone billing records, from roughly 8 p.m. until 10 p.m., Zahau <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> texted with her older sister Mary Zahau-Loehner, who confirmed that Xena had arrived home safely. At 10:48p.m., Zahau received a text from Nina Romano, the twin sister of Shacknai's ex-wife Dina Romano. Nina Romano stated {{that she wanted to}} stop by the house and speak with Zahau about Max's accident. Zahau did not reply to that message. Police said she checked her voice-mail a few hours later, at 12:50a.m. on July 13, and listened to a message. Billing records do not show who left that message. Police stated it was a message regarding the worsening of Max's condition, but declined to confirm at that time who left the message. Mary Zahau-Loehner stated that police told her it was from Jonah Shacknai. The message was deleted, meaning that police and Zahau's family never heard the contents of the message.|$|E

Some couldn't believe their eyes; sick as they were, they laughed in astonishment and delight. Bobby Orr! He <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> joked with every one of them, asking names, rubbing heads, giving everybody a little present from the box, leaving a stick, autographing everything in sight." [...] Orr made Conway promise to not print a word in the newspaper. Orr was involved in numerous charity fund raisers. In 1980, Orr was awarded the Multiple Sclerosis Silver Hope Chest Award by the Multiple Sclerosis Society for his [...] "numerous and unselfish contributions to society".|$|E
500|$|Gilbert and Winnick co-wrote and co-designed the project, {{but they}} worked {{separately}} as well: Gilbert on programming and Winnick on visuals. As {{both of them}} enjoyed B horror films, they {{decided to make a}} comedy-horror game set in a haunted house. They drew inspiration from a film whose name Winnick could not recall. He described it as [...] "a ridiculous teen horror movie", in which teenagers inside a building were killed one by one without any thought of leaving. This film, combined with clichés from popular horror movies such as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, became the basis for the game's setting. Early work on the game progressed organically: according to Gilbert, [...] "Very little was written down. Gary and I just <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> laughed a lot, and out it came." [...] Lucasfilm Games relocated to the Stable House at Skywalker Ranch during Maniac Mansions conception period, and the ranch's Main House was used {{as a model for the}} mansion. Several rooms from the Main House received exact reproductions in the game, such as a library with a spiral staircase and a media room with a large-screen TV and grand piano.|$|E

500|$|Hutchings {{introduced}} Drake to the 25-year-old American producer Joe Boyd, {{owner of}} the production and management company Witchseason Productions. The company was, at the time, licensed to Island Records, and Boyd, {{the man who had}} discovered Fairport Convention and been responsible for introducing John Martyn and The Incredible String Band to a mainstream audience, was a significant and respected figure on the UK folk scene. He and Drake formed an immediate bond, and the producer acted as a mentor to Drake throughout his career. A four-track demo, recorded in Drake's college room in the spring of 1968, led Boyd to offer a management, publishing, and production contract to the 20-year-old, and to initiate work on a debut album. According to Boyd:In those days you didn't have cassettes—he brought a reel-to-reel tape [...] that he'd done at home. Half way through the first song, I felt this was pretty special. And I called him up, and he came back in, and we <b>talked,</b> <b>and</b> I just said, [...] "I'd like to make a record." [...] He stammered, [...] "Oh, well, yeah. Okay." [...] Nick was a man of few words.In a 2004 interview, Drake's friend Paul Wheeler remembered the excitement caused by his seeming big break, and recalled that the singer had already decided not to complete his third year at Cambridge.|$|E
500|$|Epstein had {{no prior}} {{experience}} of artist management, {{yet he had}} a strong influence on the band's early dress code and stage demeanor. They had previously worn blue jeans and leather jackets, and they would stop and start songs when they felt like it or when an audience member requested a certain song. David Pomerran Szatmary states that when Epstein first saw them at The Cavern Club, he thought, [...] "They were a scruffy crowd in leather, {{and they were not}} very tidy and not very clean. They smoked as they played and they ate and <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> pretended to hit each other." [...] Epstein encouraged them to wear suits and ties, insisted that they stop swearing, smoking, drinking, or eating on stage, and also suggested the famous synchronised bow {{at the end of their}} performances. McCartney was the first to agree with Epstein's suggestions, believing that they reflected Epstein's RADA training. Epstein explained that the process from leather jackets and jeans to suits took some time: [...] "I encouraged them, at first, to get out of the leather jackets and jeans, and I wouldn't allow them to appear in jeans after a short time, and then, after that step, I got them to wear sweaters on stage, and then, very reluctantly, eventually, suits." [...] Epstein took the group to Wirral to see his friend, master tailor Beno Dorn, who made them their first suits based on a design they had previously seen, but which Epstein approved of: [...] "I thought it was an excellent design at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Alexander Charles Wood (an {{undergraduate}} whose tutor was Peacock) wrote from Cambridge to {{his cousin}} FitzRoy to recommend Darwin. Around midday on Sunday 4 September Wood received FitzRoy's response, [...] "straightforward and gentlemanlike" [...] but strongly against Darwin joining the expedition; both Darwin and Henslow then [...] "gave up the scheme". Darwin went to London anyway, and next morning met FitzRoy who {{explained that he}} had promised the place to his friend Mr. Chester, (possibly the novelist Harry Chester) but Chester had turned it down in a letter received not five minutes before Darwin arrived. FitzRoy emphasised the difficulties including cramped conditions and plain food. Darwin {{would be on the}} Admiralty's books to get provisions (worth £40 a year) and, like the ship's officers and captain, would pay £30 a year towards the mess bill. Including outfitting, the cost to him was unlikely to reach £500. The ship would sail on 10 October, and would probably be away for three years. They <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> dined together, and soon found each other agreeable. The Tory FitzRoy had been cautious at the prospect of companionship with this unknown young gentleman of Whig background, and later admitted that his letter to Wood was [...] "to throw cold water on the scheme" [...] in [...] "a sudden horror of the chances of having somebody he should not like on board". He half-seriously told Darwin later that, as [...] "an ardent disciple of Lavater", he had nearly rejected Darwin on the phrenological basis that the shape (or physiognomy) of Darwin's nose indicated a lack of determination.|$|E

2500|$|Born at Cuddalore, Madras, India, Bill Greswell was a bowler of medium-paced right-arm in-swingers, and a {{right-handed}} batsman who batted {{mostly in}} the lower order.
