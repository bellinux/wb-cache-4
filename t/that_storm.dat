5|$|Of the season's five {{tropical}} cyclones, {{only one}} reached hurricane status, the fewest since 1890. Furthermore, <b>that</b> <b>storm</b> strengthened into major hurricane, which is Category3 or {{higher on the}} modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. This storm, which was the fourth and strongest hurricane of the season, peaked at Category3 strength with 120mph (195km/h) winds. It was also attributed to at least six fatalities after sending a rogue wave across the steerage of the steamer Campania. The first storm also resulted in two deaths after a schooner wrecked in Barbados.|$|E
5|$|On September15, {{the eye of}} Choi-wan passed within 10km (5mi) of Alamagan {{and brought}} winds of up to 230km/h (145mph) to the island. The most recent storm of Choi-wan's {{intensity}} to strike the islands was Typhoon Chaba in 2004. <b>That</b> <b>storm</b> caused severe damage and widespread flooding. Unlike Chaba, relatively little rainfall fell due to Choi-wan, and no flooding was reported. The main effects from the typhoon in Saipan were downed trees which littered streets across the islands. Power lines were downed and sewer pipes were broken; however, crews began repairing damage once Choi-wan passed. In Garapan, the major shelter on the island sustained minor damage and repair work on it would take roughly a week.|$|E

5|$|When Storm's father died, he {{returned}} from Amsterdam to Liverpool {{to be with his}} mother at Stormsville, at 54 Broad Green Road, Broadgreen, Liverpool. On 27 September 1972, Storm developed a chest infection and could not sleep properly, so he took sleeping pills. The next day Storm and his mother were both found dead. A post mortem determined <b>that</b> <b>Storm</b> had not taken enough pills to kill himself, but it was suspected that, after finding her son's body, his mother had died.|$|E
5|$|Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is {{a measure}} of how active a {{hurricane}} season is. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. This explains why Hurricane Guillermo has a higher ACE than Linda. It was not as strong as <b>that</b> <b>storm,</b> but because it was above tropical storm force for a longer time, it reached a higher ACE level. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the international dateline to 140°W) is given in brackets.|$|E

Storm disbanded the Hurricanes and became a disc jockey, working at the Silver Blades Ice Rink in Liverpool, in Benidorm (he was also a water-skiing instructor there) in Jersey and Amsterdam. When Storm's father died, he returned from Amsterdam to Liverpool to be with his mother. He developed a chest infection and could not sleep properly, so he took sleeping pills. On 28 September 1972, Storm and his mother were both found dead, at Stormsville. The post mortem revealed <b>that</b> <b>Storm</b> had alcohol and sleeping pills in his blood (as had his mother) but not enough to cause his death, which was ruled accidental. Although it could not be proven, it is thought that his mother had committed suicide after finding Storm's body.|$|E
5|$|In Louisiana, Governor Edwin Edwards {{declared}} a state of emergency. About 1.25million people evacuated from the central and southeast Louisiana, while approximately 60,000others fled parishes in southwest Louisiana. A mandatory evacuation from Grand Isle was ordered by Mayor Andy Valence and the city council. In New Orleans, Mayor Sidney Barthelemy ordered the evacuation of about 200,000residents in the low-lying areas of the city. Nine shelters were opened in the city, which were occupied by thousands of people. In response to computer simulations showing <b>that</b> <b>storm</b> surge from a tropical cyclone like Hurricane Andrew could over-top the levees, workers closed 111floodgates. The Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport closed, with jumbo jets being flown to other airports. A total of 250members of the Louisiana National Guard patrolled the streets during the storm. The Red Cross assisted with opening a shelter at the University of Southwest Louisiana's Cajundome in Lafayette, equipped to handle about 2,000people.|$|E
5|$|Within the Australian {{region in}} the Southern Hemisphere between 90°E– 160°E, a {{tropical}} cyclone is named when observations or Dvorak intensity analysis indicate that a system has gale force or stronger winds near the center which are forecast to continue. The Indonesian Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika names systems that develop between the Equator and 10°S and 90°E and 141°E, while Papua New Guinea's National Weather Service names systems that develop between the Equator and 10°S and 141°E and 160°E. Outside of these areas, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology names systems that develop into tropical cyclones. If a name is assigned to a tropical cyclone that causes loss of life or significant damage and disruption to {{the way of life}} of a community, then the name assigned to <b>that</b> <b>storm</b> is retired from the list of names for the region. A replacement name is then submitted to the next World Meteorological Organization's RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee meeting.|$|E

5|$|Following the storm, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun {{declared}} the entire {{of the country}} excluding Seoul and Incheon as special disaster areas, after touring the storm damage in Busan. The government provided tax breaks and allocated ₩1.4trillion (KRW, $1.2billion) in assistance to the affected residents, after an additional budget was passed in late September 2003. This included ₩100billion (KRW, $90million USD) in immediate funds for search and rescue missions. After the storm, residents complained they did not receive adequate warning and not enough coastal areas were evacuated, {{which led to the}} high death toll. Widespread damage and continued flooding caused traffic jams in the days following the storm. A damaged rail line prompted operators to provide alternate bus service. Landslides throughout the country forced travelers to use alternate routes. By three days after the storm, most damaged roads and highways were reopened. About 33,000members of the South Korean Army were deployed to assist in relief efforts, such as clearing roads and delivering aid to storm victims. Workers quickly restored power to 95% of customers within 24hours. The government installed four new cranes for the Busan port, and assisted operators to ensure exports would not be delayed. Heavy crop damage caused fruit and vegetable prices to rise, and fish and crop exports rose 9.2% on average. The rice harvest was the lowest in 23years, due to the storm and a government effort to limit production. To assist farmers, the government increased purchases in federal contracts. Three government-run banks provided low-rate loans for businesses damaged by the storm. Residual flooding from Maemi contributed to an outbreak of conjunctivitis in the southern portion of the country. To prevent additional outbreaks, the Korean National Institute of Health sent 1,000workers to storm-damaged areas. The Korea Stock Exchange fell 1.8% due to fears <b>that</b> <b>storm</b> damage would disrupt exports.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{predict that}} glaciers will {{continue}} to recede and melt or, in some areas, disappear. It is also predicted that the Cuyo region could face a potential water crisis due {{to an increase in}} water demand caused by a reduction in river streamflows. In northern Patagonia, a similar situation is projected in which there will be a negative impact on fruit and vegetable growing owing to a reduction in the river flow in the Colorado and Chubut rivers. In the north and central parts of the country, the higher temperatures and lower precipitation projected for this region will lead to higher evaporation, intensifying droughts and leading to desertification. Heat waves could become more frequent and intense, negatively impacting agricultural production while placing more demand on energy needs. Intense precipitation could become more common, increasing the likelihood of suffering from events such as flooding, since most of its population lives in urban areas near a body of water (rivers, lakes and oceans). Climate change could extend the habitats of vectors carrying tropical diseases such as malaria southwards. Though most of the coastal regions of Argentina will not suffer permanent flooding associated with sea level rise, it is predicted <b>that</b> <b>storm</b> surges will become more frequent in coastal areas, affecting locations such as Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm reached its peak {{intensity}} on November20, the NHC issued a hurricane watch from Grand Isle, Louisiana, to Cedar Key, Florida. Later that day, {{a portion of the}} watch area was upgraded to a warning from Bay St. Louis, Mississippi to St. Marks, Florida. About 20,000employees on oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico were evacuated, many by helicopter. The USS Lexington left port from Naval Air Station Pensacola to ride out the storm in open waters, and aircraft in the region were flown inland. About 100,000people along the Florida Panhandle were told to leave their houses after Governor Bob Graham issued evacuation orders in 13counties. About 2,000people stayed in 34shelters in Panama City. Roads in the region suffered traffic jams from the large volume of evacuees. Portions of the Florida Gulf Coast had been threatened by Hurricane Elena earlier in the season, and some evacuees of <b>that</b> <b>storm</b> intended not to leave during Kate due to the poor shelter conditions that they had experienced. Governor Graham activated 300members of the Florida National Guard to prevent looting and to assist in evacuations. One person died from a stress-induced heart attack in Chipley after evacuating. Outside of Florida, about 2,200people fled Grand Isle, Louisiana.|$|E
