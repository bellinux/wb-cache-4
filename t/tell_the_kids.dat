500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide praised [...] "David Schwimmer for {{throwing}} himself into this role" [...] as Jared, [...] "this rather unlikable lout." [...] Webb Mitovich also wrote that [...] " [...] party {{in and of}} itself has to be one of 30 Rocks finest and most manic moments." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad thought that [...] " [...] Schwimmer was good as Greenzo" [...] and that [...] "the subplots were some of the most bizarre this season." [...] Robert Canning of IGN thought that the [...] "cameo from Al Gore {{at the end of the}} show added little to the episode. It was a fine bit, but it wasn't helped by the fact that nearly the entire scene had already aired in the promos leading up to the episode" [...] and that [...] "seeing [...] desperately take on the role of Greenzo and then get carried away with the whole concept could have been hysterically self-referential [...] Instead we got Jerrod as Greenzo and the whole thing just felt flat and forced." [...] Canning rated the episode [...] "8 out of 10" [...] Pittsburgh Post-Gazettes Rob Owen also felt that Al Gore's appearance had been [...] "already given away in [...] promos". He praised the episode's dialogue, saying that Baldwin's line, [...] "you could put on a silly hat and <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> how outsourcing means cheaper toys for Christmas" [...] was the sort of dialogue that [...] "makes 30 Rock rock. Hard." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that this episode [...] "was one of the best of season 2" [...] and that [...] "Schwimmer's performance reminded [...] of his most bizarre episodes as Friends Ross Geller, like 'The One With Ross's Sandwich'." [...] The episode of Friends referred to includes Schwimmer's character, Ross, shouting at his boss for eating his special Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.|$|E

By the time you get into high school, you {{have a pretty good idea}} that not everyone always tells the truth. But a good game of Diplomacy helps you to understand how skillful some people can be at fooling you!" ...|$|E

I think we were all well motivated, but what we did was run a hoax. 'Father Knows Best' purported to be a reasonable facsimile of life. And the bad thing is, the model is so deceitful. It usually revolved around not wanting to tell the truth, either out of embarrassment, or not wanting to hurt someone. If I could say anything to make up for all the years I lent myself to (that), it would be, 'You Know Best." ...|$|E
5000|$|Pasarell {{was a very}} stylish player, and was {{coached by}} the celebrated Welby Van Horn (the Runner-Up in the 1939 U.S. Championships) at the Caribe Hilton Hotel, San Juan, Puerto Rico. In his 1988 book Open Tennis: The First Twenty Years, British news correspondent, radio {{commentator}} and sports writer Richard Evans wrote that [...] "Lack of speed and a less than energetic attitude towards training probably prevented Pasarell from doing full justice to his ability. When we were on tour together in Africa in 1971 (for the $25,000 Marlboro African Grand Prix, along with Marty Riessen, Tom Okker and Arthur Ashe, and his Pasarell's new bride Shireen née Fareed), Ashe would <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids,</b> 'Watch Charlie play and copy his strokes.

[...] Pasarell also {{had a very good}} service, and in 1967 at the U.S. National Indoors, the celebrated writer and player Eugene Scott gave the opinion that Pasarell and Ashe had the two hardest serves in the world.|$|E

Soon you will realize that your anger is not against me, but against the whole system that lied to you.’” According to the AP, the film “has infuriated {{people on both sides of}} the Israeli-Palestinian divide,” with some Israelis “asking why the government helped fund a film so scathing in its criticism of its own policies, while Palestinians are shocked that the film is winning accolades for being 'Israeli.'” The Israeli nonprofit Consensus petitioned the Israeli Attorney General claiming that Davidi and Burnat “should be charged with slander and prosecuted for 'incitement.'” ...|$|E

However, Mr. Fischoeder and Kurt crank up the speed on the boat, not realizing that the speed is causing the plane to lift into the air while still tied to the boat. The Belchers panic when they see that the boat plans to pass under a bridge. Afraid they might die, Bob and Linda {{apologize}} for not being passionate enough and not being happy with what they had, respectively. Bob finds Kurt's pocket knife in the plane and {{has no choice but}} to climb out onto the railing and try to cut the rope. He manages to cut the rope just in time and Linda uses what she learned to pull the plane up and over the bridge. However, Linda realizes that she does not know how to land the plane: she only saw Kurt land after causing a fake nosedive. Linda tries the same and successfully lands the plane near the pier. The adrenaline of the fake plane crash has its effect on Linda and Bob, who jokingly <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> to jump out and swim to shore to give them privacy, which Tina does, much to their chagrin.|$|E
5000|$|In 1979, Blackmore said: [...] "I like popular music. I like ABBA very much. But there's so much stigma like, 'you can't do {{this because}} you're a heavy band', and I think that's rubbish.

At 16 I didn't want to know about classical music: I'd had it rammed down my throat. But now I feel an obligation to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> 'look, just give classical music a chance' ... the guitar frustrates me a lot because I'm not good enough to play it sometimes so I get mad and throw a moody. Sometimes I feel that what I'm doing is not right, {{in the sense that the}} whole rock and roll business has become a farce, like Billy Smart, Jr. Circus, and the only music that ever moves me is very disciplined classical music, which I can't play. But there's a reason I've made money. It's because I believe in what I'm doing, in that I do it my way—I play for myself first, then secondly the audience—I try to put as much as I can in it for them. Lastly I play for musicians and the band, and for critics not at all." ...|$|E
