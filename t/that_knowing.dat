5|$|Ruiz {{notes that}} writing {{also has the}} power to {{transform}} reality. It brings the reader back to the past, allowing the reader to comprehend myths or distorted stories told by historians. Ruiz contends <b>that</b> <b>knowing</b> the past is crucial to one's understanding of the present that takes us to postmodernism, and argues that The Feast of the Goat can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power to history recreation.|$|E
5|$|Jones was {{not alone}} in his wish to get more screen time; the writers, who were reading Internet forums and {{receiving}} mail from the audience that requested the same thing, decided that Pete would learn Clark's secret in season two. The creative team hoped <b>that</b> <b>knowing</b> Clark's secret would allow the character to be written into more scenes, and become involved on a daily basis with the Kent family. Ultimately, Pete's primary story arc in season three became the character's inability to deal with knowing Clark's secret, and his growing feeling of abandonment from Clark, who was spending more time with Chloe, Lana and Lex. Millar explains that they felt that the character was being wasted on Smallville, and that led to the decision of writing the character off the show with the hope that he could come back in future episodes. There was dissension between the cast and crew over Jones's departure. According to Annette O'Toole (Martha Kent), Clark needs a guy friend in his life, and she feels that the Kents would have taken Pete in when his parents left Smallville. Though Gough does not disagree that writing out Pete Ross was the best thing, he does feel that his exit could have gone better. According to Gough, Pete's departure felt rushed, and seemed to lack the importance that it should have had.|$|E
5|$|Max {{breaks through}} {{security}} at the train yard and boards the train. She locates Van Der Mescht, who initially refuses to help her. After Max threatens him with torture, Van Der Mescht explains that I Corporation was a rival of Manticore, and had a military contract for more aggressive genetic research. They created a 'Y' series of genetically engineered soldiers (as opposed to Manticore's 'X' series); when Max and Beka were born, Beka was taken by I Corporation so that the two different series could be compared. I Corporation guards ambush the room, killing Van Der Mescht before he can divulge more. I Corporation send a single soldier, a transgenic boss named Bear, to kill Max. Bear is defeated, and Max reaches the I Corporation headquarters with the train. Max fights {{her way to the}} upper level of the headquarters, defeating guards and the boss characters Beetle, Gekko and Bear again, before she confronts Beka. Beka reveals that she now controls the I Corporation, and has engineered a younger replacement to succeed her using the DNA that she and Max shares. She tries to recruit Max to join her and their 'younger sister' in creating a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers. Max refuses and Beka attacks her. After killing Beka, Max tries to rescue her younger sister. The cloaked figure, whose identity is never revealed, tries unsuccessfully to stop her. Logan arrives in a helicopter and rescues Max and her younger sister from the complex. Later, while sitting {{on the roof of the}} Space Needle, Max laments <b>that</b> <b>knowing</b> the truth about Beka is worse than not knowing at all, but is determined to create a positive life for herself and her younger sister. A post-credits scene shows Max and Original Cindy dancing in their apartment.|$|E

25|$|Observability is {{a measure}} for how well {{internal}} states of a system can be inferred by knowledge of its external outputs. The observability and controllability of a system are mathematical duals (i.e., as controllability provides that an input is available that brings any initial state to any desired final state, observability provides <b>that</b> <b>knowing</b> an output trajectory provides enough information to predict the initial state of the system).|$|E
25|$|Among {{the many}} types of {{calendars}} the Maya maintained, the most important include a 260-day cycle, a 360-day cycle or 'year', a 365-day cycle or year, a lunar cycle, and a Venus cycle, which tracked the synodic period of Venus. Maya of the European contact period said <b>that</b> <b>knowing</b> the past aided in both understanding the present and predicting the future (Diego de Landa). The 260-day cycle was a calendar to govern agriculture, observe religious holidays, mark the movements of celestial bodies and memorialize public officials. The 260-day cycle was also used for divination, and (like the Catholic calendar of saints) to name newborns.|$|E

500|$|James Hunt of Den of Geek {{said that}} it was a [...] "very good episode" [...] despite being [...] "Wesley-heavy".

Soon, however, the children thought it was [...] "cool that their hero, Harry, was encountering some of the creatures of mythology." [...] Colbert felt <b>that</b> <b>knowing</b> the origins of Rowling's character and creatures increased [...] "the books' magic tenfold" [...] and made the Harry Potter universe seem more lifelike.

500|$|In early 2012, Loder made a {{music video}} for [...] "Your Love Alone", {{one of the}} album's tracks, which was {{uploaded}} to YouTube.

Through her experience, she became convinced <b>that</b> <b>knowing</b> God is all-important, expressing this concept in the chorus: [...] "Your love alone is sufficient. It needs no company." [...] She stated that she wrote the song [...] "One Name Away" [...] after having watched The Tyra Banks Show.

500|$|Norton and Leterrier disputed {{with the}} {{producers}} {{over the final}} running time: they {{wanted it to be}} near 135 minutes, while the producers wanted the film to be under two hours.

Norton dismissed this, [...] "Our healthy process , which is and should be a private matter, was misrepresented publicly as a 'dispute', seized on by people looking for a good story, and has been distorted {{to such a degree that}} it risks distracting from the film itself, which Marvel, Universal and I refuse to let happen.

500|$|Desson Thomson of The Washington Post {{stated that}} the film {{successfully}} reproduced the [...] "panic and fear" [...] at the palace as events unfolded, saying it came across like a [...] "raw, Costa-Gavras-style thriller" [...] that was [...] "worth watching {{down to the last}} thrilling minute". He said <b>that</b> <b>knowing</b> how uncertain Venezuela's future was made the film even more powerful. Thomson believed the handheld video was put to good use, calling its [...] "news-breaking immediacy... intoxicating". He concluded, [...] "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised is an extraordinary piece of electronic history. And a riveting movie." [...] In the Miami New Times, Brett Sokol agreed that the film was [...] "never less than thrilling", but said that as history, it was [...] "strictly agitprop". Similarly, Mark Jenkins wrote in the Washington City Paper that the film was [...] "unapologetically polemical", but [...] "notable foremost as a gripping you-are-there account".|$|E
500|$|The most debated {{point is}} the {{patriotic}} shouts, sometimes {{claimed to have been}} accompanied by singing of the Marseillaise. These shouts are denied entirely by Griffiths, but are mentioned in French accounts. Renaudin's report does claim that sailors shouted [...] "Vive la République", but that it was in desperation for being unable to reach the British craft; it does not mention any particular defiance in the intent, though, nor does it mention flags or La Marseillaise; this position is followed by Troude and Farrère. Guérin proposes a variation, <b>that</b> <b>knowing</b> themselves doomed, the sailors remaining on Vengeur made a last display of patriotic and political fervour before dying. William James provides an alternative theory when he suggests that any person who behaved in such a manner on the stricken ship was acting under the influence of alcohol; Troude, otherwise very critical of Barère's account, vehemently dismissed this idea.|$|E
500|$|The {{texts and}} images of the Book of the Dead were magical as well as religious. Magic was as {{legitimate}} an activity as praying to the gods, even when the magic was aimed at controlling the gods themselves. Indeed, there was little distinction for the Ancient Egyptians between magical and religious practice. The concept of magic (heka) was also intimately linked with the spoken and written word. [...] The act of speaking a ritual formula {{was an act of}} creation; there is a sense in which action and speech were one and the same thing. The magical power of words extended to the written word. Hieroglyphic script was held to have been invented by the god Thoth, and the hieroglyphs themselves were powerful. Written words conveyed the full force of a spell. This was even true when the text was abbreviated or omitted, as often occurred in later Book of the Dead scrolls, particularly if the accompanying images were present. The Egyptians also believed <b>that</b> <b>knowing</b> the name of something gave power over it; thus, the Book of the Dead equips its owner with the mystical names of many of the entities he would encounter in the afterlife, giving him power over them.|$|E

She showed particular interest in photographs of the area around Hollin Brown Knoll and Shiny Brook, but said {{that it was impossible to}} be sure of the locations without visiting the moor. The security considerations for such a visit were significant; there were threats made against her should she visit the moors, but Home Secretary Douglas Hurd agreed with Topping that it would be worth the risk. Writing in 1989, Topping said that he felt [...] "quite cynical" [...] about Hindley's motivation in helping the police. Although the letter from Winnie Johnson may have played a part, he believed that Hindley's real concern was <b>that,</b> <b>knowing</b> of Brady's [...] "precarious" [...] mental state, she was afraid that he might decide to co-operate with the police, and wanted to make certain that she, and not Brady, was the one to gain whatever benefit there may have been in terms of public approval.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{number of}} the {{black-and-white}} [...] "special", [...] "Let It Snow" [...] featuring Blaine and Kurt, garnered the most praise.

While Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger enjoyed the number, she preferred the previous year's offering; Flandez called [...] "Let It Snow" [...] an [...] "admirable job". Futterman characterized it as [...] "both effortless and full of seasonal spirit", and Votta said it was [...] "a spot-on tribute to male duets of yesteryear with <b>that</b> <b>knowing</b> undercurrent of romance even when it's not explicit". Chaney gave it an [...] "A", but she wondered at the inclusion of the next song, [...] "My Favorite Things", since it [...] "technically isn't a holiday song". The number was also not as well received as many of the others: Bell described it as taking [...] "a turn for the worse", Hyman noted that it [...] "didn't do too much for me", and Kubicek said it [...] "seemed to drag {{on and on and on}} with no real purpose". However, West called it a [...] "wonderful effort" [...] and Slezak wrote that [...] "a little Rodgers and Hammerstein is always welcome at any party"; both reviewers gave the performance a [...] "B+".|$|E
