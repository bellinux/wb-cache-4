In 2006 Eurostar's Environment Group was set up, {{with the aim}} of making changes in the Eurostar services' daily running to decrease the environmental impact, the organisation setting itself a target of reducing carbon emissions per passenger journey by 25% by 2012.

5|$|Patients {{and their}} guardians must be apprised of any serious risks {{and the common}} side effects of pain treatments. What {{appears to be an}} {{obviously}} acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be unacceptable to the person who has to undertake that risk or experience the side effect. For instance, people who experience pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The care provider should not insist on treatment that someone rejects, and must not provide treatment that <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.|$|E
5|$|The Diocese of Youngstown once oversaw {{more than}} 20 schools {{within the city}} limits.

(The two high schools share a heated and longstanding rivalry in athletics.) Several additional Catholic schools operate in Mahoning, Trumbull, Columbiana, Portage, Stark, and Ashtabula counties.|$|E
5000|$|The Enterprise {{arrives at}} the end of an ion trail above the trinary starlit {{habitable}} planet Triskelion located in the M-24 Alpha system. When Spock and McCoy attempt to beam down to rescue <b>the</b> captain, <b>the</b> <b>Providers</b> ensnare <b>the</b> ship with a power beam and take over full control of <b>the</b> Enterprise. <b>The</b> <b>Providers</b> tell Kirk that his ship is now at stake in the arena games. Kirk challenges <b>the</b> <b>Providers</b> to show themselves and then he suddenly finds himself in an underground chamber. <b>The</b> <b>Providers</b> turn out to be three disembodied brains sustained by machinery which hold the personas of <b>the</b> <b>Providers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Providers</b> explain that they watch over the Thralls and for their entertainment, wager [...] "quatloos" [...] over battles between the Thralls. Kirk decides to give them a wager they cannot refuse and offers that if he and his two officers emerge victorious in battle with their drill Thralls, that <b>the</b> <b>Providers</b> will let him and his crew go while freeing all of the Thralls and instead use their power to teach the Thralls to become a free society, while if Kirk and his officers lose, <b>the</b> <b>Providers</b> can take his crew to use in further competitions. <b>The</b> <b>Providers</b> agree, but stipulate that Kirk must battle the three Thralls alone.|$|R

40|$|This report {{examines}} ATM Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC) and Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC) pricing from <b>the</b> network <b>provider’s</b> {{point of}} view. Specifically, {{based on previous}} work [1] that predicts customer choices between PVC and SVC service based on pricing parameters, we determine pricing parameters that will optimize <b>the</b> service <b>provider’s</b> net income, taking into account both revenue derived from customers and {{the costs associated with}} providing PVC and SVC service. The analysis is based on a general model of the user population’s traffic characteristics. The results show that by increasing bandwidth allocation prices, <b>the</b> service <b>provider</b> can encourage more users to choose SVC service, thereby increasing total revenue and reducing <b>the</b> <b>provider’s</b> bandwidth costs, but driving up <b>the</b> <b>provider’s</b> connection setup costs. The point at which <b>the</b> <b>provider’s</b> net income is maximized is strongly influenced by the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>provider’s</b> bandwidth costs and per-connection setup costs; smaller relative setup costs will motivate <b>the</b> service <b>provider</b> to encourage (through pricing parameters) more users to utilize SVC service. We conclude with an example based on a we...|$|R
5|$|A {{reported}} 10,000 Celtic fans travelled to Germany {{to cheer}} on Celtic {{in the second}} leg. John Hartson returned from suspension to the starting line-up whilst defender Ulrik Laursen also came into the side; with Shaun Maloney and Jackie McNamara dropping out. After early pressure from Stuttgart, Celtic scored on 12 minutes; Hartson played a pass from midfield out wide right to Didier Agathe, who raced down the wing and on reaching the bye-line crossed in to the Stuttgart penalty box. Hartson headed the ball towards the back post and Alan Thompson scored with a diving header. Two minutes later Celtic extended their lead. Agathe was again <b>the</b> <b>provider,</b> racing 50 yards down the right wing and cutting {{the ball into the}} penalty box to Chris Sutton who scored from close range with a powerful shot. That left Stuttgart requiring to score five goals to salvage the tie. A comeback by the Bundesliga club saw them eventually win 3–2 on the second leg, but Celtic won the tie 5–4 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Baltimore (which is an {{independent}} city) the county is the default unit of local government. Under Maryland law, counties exercise powers reserved in most other states at the municipal or state levels, so there is little incentive for a community to incorporate. Many of the state's most populous and economically important communities, such as Bethesda, Silver Spring, Columbia, and Towson are unincorporated and receive their municipal services from the county. In fact, there are no incorporated municipalities at all in Baltimore County or Howard County, and the state's largest county, Montgomery County, only has three incorporated municipalities. The county-equivalent is also <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> of public schools—school districts as a separate level of government do not exist in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The {{obligation}} {{of a professional}} medical care provider to alleviate suffering may occasionally come into conflict with the obligation to prolong life. If a terminally ill person prefers to be painless, despite {{a high level of}} sedation and a risk of shortening their life, they should be provided with their desired pain relief (despite the cost of sedation and a possibly slightly shorter life). Where a person is unable to be involved in this type of decision, the law and the medical profession in the United Kingdom allow the doctor to assume that the person would prefer to be painless, and thus <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> may prescribe and administer adequate analgesia, even if the treatment may slightly hasten death. It is taken that the underlying cause of death in this case is the illness and not the necessary pain management.|$|E
50|$|The SAML {{specification}} defines three roles: {{the principal}} (typically a user), <b>the</b> Identity <b>provider</b> (IdP), and <b>the</b> service <b>provider</b> (SP). In <b>the</b> use case addressed by SAML, the principal requests a service from <b>the</b> service <b>provider.</b> <b>The</b> service <b>provider</b> requests and obtains an identity assertion from <b>the</b> identity <b>provider.</b> On <b>the</b> {{basis of this}} assertion, <b>the</b> service <b>provider</b> can make an access control decision - in other words it can decide whether to perform some service for the connected principal.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a game between two capacity providers that compete for customers through a broker who earns commissions on sales and sells to both loyal and nonloyal customers. <b>The</b> <b>providers</b> compete by selecting commission margins and sales targets above which the margins on total sales increase. We study the contract form in equilibrium {{and the effect}} that sales targets have on the profit split between <b>the</b> <b>providers</b> and <b>the</b> broker. We show that in equilibrium, contracts require positive sales targets that can be best described as a mechanism for <b>the</b> larger <b>provider</b> to profit {{at the expense of}} <b>the</b> smaller <b>provider.</b> <b>The</b> effect of sales targets is different when commission margins are exogenous and <b>the</b> <b>providers</b> compete by setting targets. In this case, it is <b>the</b> low-margin <b>provider</b> who benefits from sales targets {{at the expense of the}} broker, who in this context resists the imposition of targets...|$|R

25|$|Three major {{mechanisms}} are {{suggested by the}} Institute of Medicine that may contribute to healthcare disparities from the provider's side: bias (or prejudice) against racial and ethnic minorities; greater clinical uncertainty when interacting with minority patients; and beliefs held by <b>the</b> <b>provider</b> about the behavior or health of minorities.
