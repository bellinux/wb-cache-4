When you combine this with his time spent at Royal St George's, the course nearest his home where he learned to play golf, you start <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of his architectural influence. In 1911, he moved to Inwood Country Club and remodeled the course over several years eventually leading to the course hosting the 1921 PGA Championship and the 1923 U.S. Open. On 16 September 1905 Strong partnered with 18-year-old Jerome Travers to tie for second place, shooting 72, in a four-ball tournament—part of the 1905 Metropolitan Open—that was held at Fox Hills Golf Club on Staten Island.|$|E
500|$|Northanger Abbey {{was shot}} on {{location}} in Ireland from late August 2006. The Independent's Sarah Shannon stated that ITV had filmed in the country [...] "largely thanks to the generous tax incentives offered by the republic's government." [...] Filming lasted for five weeks and the drama was shot on Super 16 mm film. Twenty-first century Dublin streets doubled for nineteenth century Bath, the setting for the novel. Shannon thought some viewers might be annoyed with this and Thompson commented, [...] "But isn't that shot of the Royal Crescent in Bath {{a bit of a}} cliché? What we've done is create our own Bath." [...] Lismore Castle in County Waterford was chosen as Northanger Abbey, home of the Tilney family. Higginsbrook House, near County Meath, served as the exterior to the Morland family's home. The house was later used in Becoming Jane, a film about Austen's early life. Other shooting locations included Dublin Castle, Ardbraccan House and Charleville Castle. Jones told Paul Byrne of the Evening Herald that she enjoyed shooting in Ireland as she got <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the country.|$|E

[...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E

2500|$|Altman {{was one of}} the few filmmakers who [...] "paid full {{attention}} to the possibilities of sound" [...] when filming. He tried to replicate natural conversational sounds, even with large casts, by wiring hidden microphones to actors, then recording them talking over each other with multiple soundtracks. During the filming, he wore a headset to ensure that important dialogue could be heard, without emphasizing it. This produced a [...] "dense audio experience" [...] for viewers, allowing them to hear multiple scraps of dialogue, as if they were listening in on various private conversations. Altman recognized that although large casts hurt a film commercially, [...] "I like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of stuff going on." ...|$|E

One of the unique products of this series, female turtle Venus, is notorious for becoming one of the additions to the franchise that Laird most despises. However, he took a more active role in the next TMNT animated venture, acting as [...] "a consultant, and... working with the guy I consider the head writer, Lloyd Goldfine." [...] In this role, he says [...] "rom the get-go I've been looking at everything, from day one. Story premises, outlines, the full scripts and the sketching and designing of characters and settings. I've been doing a little drawing myself. Lots of suggestions. I've seen a few of the episodes, and it's neat <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the stuff I've worked on." [...] While final preparations were underway, he relaunched the official comics canon of the franchise with [...] "Volume Four" [...] (the third published by Mirage Studios), with artwork supplied by fellow TMNT writer, friend, and Rat King creator Jim Lawson. When the new series proved a success, Laird relaunched Tales of the TMNT to accompany the fourth volume.|$|E
