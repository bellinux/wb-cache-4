500|$|Local {{favourite}} Sergio Pérez, who {{had been}} on a one-stop strategy, said after the race that it had been the safety car period that [...] "destroyed" [...] his chances at a better result, but added: [...] "What I could do, I did perfectly, so I'm happy with that." [...] His teammate Nico Hülkenberg had finished the race in front of him, and said after the race: [...] "The Safety Car ended up playing into my hands, which is <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> luck you always need to get a good result". Speaking about the race, 14th-placed Jenson Button said: [...] "Painful, I think, is the word. I was on the harder tyre at the start but still it was just waving goodbye to everyone in front really." [...] He also stated that he believed that McLaren were more affected by the high altitude than the other teams. On his one-lap outing, Fernando Alonso explained that the problem that caused his retirement had been discovered the night before. He added: [...] "We had two possibilities, retire the car without even starting the race or try our maximum, knowing that maybe one or two laps was the maximum we could achieve [...] We did one lap, for respect of the fans because they were amazing all weekend." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2009, Chad was scripted {{as the son}} of Bill and Marsha Peterson. In June 2009 it was {{announced}} that David Leisure had been cast in the recurring role of D.A. Woods. In October 2009, the character's name was revised to Chad Peterson Woods when D.A. Woods was revealed to be his father. In February 2010 Soap Opera Digest reported that veteran soap actress, Jessica Tuck, known for her role as One Life to Live's Megan Gordon was cast in the role of Chad's mother. Deidrick explained that Chad goes to Kate for answers because she has been a [...] "mother figure." [...] Both the actor and executive producer Gary Tomlin enjoyed Chad's scenes with Koslow's Kate. Chad immediately confronts Madeline and he is [...] "completely devastated" [...] when she admits to being a former prostitute. Chad is fed up with his mother's lies and just wants everything out on the table. The revelation really impacts him in an [...] "inexplicable" [...] way. Deidrick described Chad's reaction as [...] "flabbergasted" [...] and wants to get away from her. When Chad witnesses Madeline's fall, he freezes for a moment because he is unable to [...] "process" [...] the situation. Such tragedy could have the potential to screw him up. Because Deidrick did not know the pain of losing a parent, let alone his own mother, the actor does his best to portray Chad during the scenes; Deidrick's first reaction as Chad is going into denial. Chad clings on to <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> courage he has left hoping to work things out with Charles in the future. According to Deidrick, the aftermath of his mother's death and his confrontation with Charles makes Chad a little [...] "cuckoo crazy." [...] Knowing Chad is all alone in the world Kate schemes to expose that Chad is Madeline's son with Kate's husband, Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo) born on March 3, 1990, making him a whole year older than was initially said to be. The storyline showcased two very distinct sides to Chad's personality. According to Deidrick, during scenes with Kate, he intentionally emphasized Chad's vulnerabilities due to his mother's recent death; he is in desperate need of a mother figure at the moment, and Kate fills that void. Chad does not show that side of his personality too often for fear of getting hurt. On the other hand, Chad's relationship with his new found father Stefano appears to be a bit more volatile. The nature of the relationship is first displayed in November 2010 when Chad confronts Stefano with a knife and demands blood for a DNA test. Chad has no idea how to react to the DNA results. According to Deidrick, [...] " [...] struggles to find the courage to be able to love [...] who had a relationship with his mother and never knew he existed." [...] Deidrick explained that Chad rejects Stefano based on instinct. It is all he knows thanks to D.A. Woods who always pushes him away when things get difficult. However, Stefano is not easily turned away. Deidrick expected the role to be short lived thinking the character was only to wrap up the baby switch storyline. However, he accredited Gary Tomlin with fighting for the character and believing in him as an actor. Deidrick said that it was Tomlin's idea to attach him to a main family, [...] "So they made [...] a DiMera." ...|$|E
