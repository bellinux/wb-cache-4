5|$|To be most {{effective}} at controlling a pest, a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it {{to keep pace with}} changes to the habitat in space and time. Control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence, so that it can maintain its population even in the temporary absence of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> and if it is an opportunistic forager, enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population.|$|E
5|$|Poisoned bait is {{a common}} method for {{controlling}} rats, mice, birds, slugs, snails, ants, cockroaches and other pests. The basic granules, or other formulation, contains a food attractant for <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>species</b> and a suitable poison. For ants, a slow-acting toxin is needed so that the workers have time to carry the substance back to the colony, and for flies, a quick-acting substance to prevent further egg-laying and nuisance. Baits for slugs and snails often contain the molluscide metaldehyde, dangerous to children and household pets.|$|E
25|$|Because the plasmid is the “vehicle” {{from which}} the {{immunogen}} is expressed, optimising vector design for maximal protein expression is essential. One way of enhancing protein expression is by optimising the codon usage of pathogenic mRNAs for eukaryotic cells. Pathogens often have different AT-contents than <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> so altering the gene sequence of the immunogen to reflect the codons more commonly used in <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>species</b> may improve its expression.|$|E

The requirement for this transfer to take place is that the chemical species must have in its structure a 1 H proton that is exchangeable with those of water.|$|R
50|$|In fishing, {{incidental}} catch {{is that part}} of the catch which was not originally targeted, but was caught and retained anyway. It can be contrasted with discards, which {{is that part of}} the catch which was not originally targeted, but was caught and returned to the sea, and bycatch, which is for all the species caught apart from <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> <b>species.</b>|$|R

Results suggest that, despite chronic trawling clearly modifing the infaunal community structure, changes linked to variability in the effort regime were too small to influence the M. barbatus population at the within-year time scale...|$|R
25|$|Interfering with insects' {{reproduction}} can {{be accomplished}} by sterilizing males of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>species</b> and releasing them, so that they mate with females but do not produce offspring. This technique was first used on the screwworm fly in 1958 and has since been used with the medfly, the tsetse fly, and the gypsy moth. However, this can be a costly, time consuming approach that only works on some types of insects.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} nets {{are maintained}} {{more or less}} vertically in the usual way by floats on the floatline and weights on the groundline. They are set on the bottom. After a time depending on <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> they are hauled on board. Traditional combined nets were hauled by hand, especially on smaller boats. Recent hydraulic driven net haulers are now common. The gilled, entangled and enmeshed fish are removed from the net by hand. Of some concern with this method is ghost fishing by lost nets and bycatch of diving seabirds. Nets combined in this way were first used in the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|Trollers – {{catch fish}} by towing astern {{one of more}} {{trolling}} lines. A trolling line is a fishing line with natural or artificial baited hooks trailed by a vessel near the surface or at a certain depth. Several lines can be towed {{at the same time}} using outriggers to keep the lines apart. The lines can be hauled in manually or by small winches. A length of rubber is often included in each line as a shock absorber. The trolling line is towed at a speed depending on <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>species,</b> from 2.3 knots up to at least 7 knots. Trollers range from small open boats to large refrigerated vessels 30 metres long. In many tropical artisanal fisheries, trolling is done with sailing canoes with outriggers for stability. With properly designed vessels, trolling is an economical and efficient way of catching tuna, mackerel and other pelagic fish swimming close to the surface. Purpose built trollers are usually equipped with two or four trolling booms raised and lowered by topping lifts, held in position by adjustable stays. Electrically powered or hydraulic reels can be used to haul in the lines.|$|E

25|$|It {{may seem}} {{reasonable}} to assume that irradiating food might lead to radiation-tolerant strains, similar to the way that strains of bacteria have developed resistance to antibiotics. Bacteria develop a resistance to antibiotics after an individual uses antibiotics repeatedly. Much like pasteurization plants, products that pass through irradiation plants are processed once, and are not processed and reprocessed. Cycles of heat treatment have been shown to produce heat-tolerant bacteria, yet no problems have appeared so far in pasteurization plants. Furthermore, when the irradiation dose is chosen to target a specific species of microbe, it is calibrated to doses several times the value required to target the species. This ensures that the process randomly destroys all members of a target species. Therefore, the more irradiation-tolerant members of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>species</b> are not given any evolutionary advantage. Without evolutionary advantage, selection does not occur. As to the irradiation process directly producing mutations that lead to more virulent, radiation-resistant strains, the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food found that there is no evidence; on the contrary, irradiation has been found to cause loss of virulence and infectivity, as mutants are usually less competitive and less adapted.|$|E

In November 1997, Rasmussen and Ben King of the American Museum of Natural History spent ten days unsuccessfully searching two east Indian locations before driving west {{to the site of}} another old specimen, where King spotted a small, chunky owl with short, heavily white-feathered legs and huge claws, which Rasmussen confirmed as <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>species</b> whilst the owl was videotaped and photographed.|$|E
500|$|Ant-mimicking spiders face several challenges: they {{generally}} develop slimmer abdomens and false [...] "waists" [...] in the cephalothorax {{to mimic the}} three distinct regions (tagmata) of an ant's body; they wave the first pair of legs {{in front of their}} heads to mimic antennae, which spiders lack, and to conceal {{the fact that they have}} eight legs rather than six; they develop large color patches round one pair of eyes to disguise the fact that {{they generally}} have eight simple eyes, while ants have two compound eyes; they cover their bodies with reflective hairs to resemble the shiny bodies of ants. In some spider species, males and females mimic different ant species, as female spiders are usually much larger than males. Ant-mimicking spiders also modify their behavior to resemble that of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>species</b> of ant; for example, many adopt a zig-zag pattern of movement, ant-mimicking jumping spiders avoid jumping, and spiders of the genus Synemosyna walk on the outer edges of leaves in the same way as Pseudomyrmex. Ant-mimicry in many spiders and other arthropods may be for protection from predators that hunt by sight, including birds, lizards and spiders. However, several ant-mimicking spiders prey either on ants or on the ants' [...] "livestock", such as aphids. When at rest, the ant-mimicking crab spider Amyciaea does not closely resemble Oecophylla, but while hunting it imitates the behavior of a dying ant to attract worker ants. After a kill, some ant-mimicking spiders hold their victims between themselves and large groups of ants to avoid being attacked.|$|E

Poisoned carcasses however kill a wide range of carrion feeders, not only <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> <b>species.</b> Raptors in Israel were nearly wiped out following a period of intense poisoning of rats and other crop pests.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{practice}} of trawling started (around the 15th century), there have been concerns over trawling's lack of selectivity. Trawls may be non-selective, sweeping up both marketable and undesirable fish and fish of both legal and illegal size. Any part of the catch which cannot be used is considered by-catch, some of which is killed accidentally by the trawling process. By-catch commonly includes valued species such as dolphins, sea turtles, and sharks, and may also include sublegal or immature individuals of <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> <b>species.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Many {{saltwater}} species, particularly large, {{fast and}} powerful fish, {{are not easily}} slowed down by [...] "palming" [...] the hand on the reel. Instead, a purpose-made saltwater reel for these species must have a powerful drag system. Furthermore, saltwater reels purpose-made for larger fish must be larger, heavier, and corrosion-resistant; a typical high-quality saltwater reel costs 500.00 USD or more. Corrosion-resistant equipment is key to durability in all types of saltwater fishing, regardless of the size and power of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E

Scientists have proposed several safeguards for ensuring the containment of experimental gene drives including molecular, reproductive, and ecological. Many recommend that immunization and reversal drives be developed in tandem with gene drives in order to overwrite their effects if necessary.

50|$|Illegal, unreported and {{unregulated}} (IUU) fishing {{can have}} a significant impact on the sustainability of both <b>the</b> <b>targeted</b> <b>species</b> and <b>the</b> ecosystem. Fishing generally has the capacity to damage fragile marine ecosystems and vulnerable species such as coral reefs, turtles and seabirds. In fact, all eight sea turtle species are now endangered, and illegal fishing and hunting are two major reasons for their destruction. Regulating legitimate fisheries is aimed at mitigating such impacts, but IUU fishers rarely comply with regulations. This may reduce future productivity and biodiversity and create imbalances in the ecosystem.|$|R
50|$|The {{long-term}} ecological {{effects of}} cormorant culling are uncertain and disputed.

A paucity of dietary studies {{also means that}} the impact cormorants have on commercially important species (with the exception of pond-based aquaculture) are difficult to estimate. One unintended consequence of cormorant culling is that managers who enter nesting grounds to cull or oil eggs may cause more harm to other bird species in the process than the nesting cormorants do themselves.|$|R
2500|$|Tying {{artificial}} flies {{has always}} been about imitating some form of fish prey. Significant literature on the concepts of imitation exists especially for trout flies. A Book of Trout Flies – Jennings (1935), Streamside Guide to Naturals & Their Imitations – Art Flick (1947), Matching the Hatch – Schweibert (1955), Selective Trout - Swisher and Richards (1971), Nymphs - Schweibert (1973), Caddisflies - LaFontaine (1989), Prey - Richards (1995) are a few 20th-century titles that deal extensively with imitating natural prey. From a human perspective, many fly patterns do not exactly imitate fish prey found in nature, but they are nevertheless successful. A successful or [...] "killing" [...] fly pattern imitates something that <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>species</b> preys on. This has resulted in fly tyers and fishers devising additional terms to characterize those flies that obviously do not imitate anything in particular, yet are nevertheless successful at catching fish. These additional terms are inconsistently but commonly associated with trout-fly patterns because of their huge variety, both historical and contemporary. The term Attractor pattern {{has been applied to}} flies which resemble nothing in particular but are successful in attracting strikes from fish (Trout Fishing, Brooks 1972). In Flies for Trout (1993) Dick Stewart characterizes these same patterns as General Purpose. Dave Hughes, in Trout Flies-The Tier’s Reference (1999), describes the same flies as Searching flies and characterizes three levels of imitation: Impressionistic, Suggestive and Imitative.|$|E
