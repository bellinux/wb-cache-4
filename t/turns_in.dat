5|$|A {{group of}} emigrants under Hendrik Potgieter {{passed through the}} Krugers' Caledon encampments in early 1836. Potgieter envisioned a Boer {{republic}} with himself in a prominent role; he sufficiently impressed the Krugers that they joined his party of Voortrekkers. Kruger's father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical passages from memory each day after lunch and dinner. At stops along the journey classrooms were improvised from reeds and grass and the more educated emigrants took <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> teaching.|$|E
5|$|Although {{set in a}} hospital, it uses {{no medical}} storylines; the action is {{produced}} {{by a series of}} soap opera-style twists and <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> the personal lives of the characters. They proceed through a series of often absurd sketch-like scenes, or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up, often emphasizing the body language of the characters. The show had eight writers. Two series were made by the Talkback Thames production company for Channel 4.|$|E
5|$|Bernard James Tindal Bosanquet (13 October 1877– 12 October 1936) was an English cricketer {{best known}} for inventing the googly, a {{delivery}} designed to deceive the batsman. When bowled, {{it appears to be}} a leg break, but after pitching the ball <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction to that which is expected, behaving as an off break instead. Bosanquet, who played first-class cricket for Middlesex between 1898 and 1919, appeared in seven Test matches for England as an all-rounder. He was chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1905.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, as the Interstate Highway System was being built {{throughout}} the United States, east–west travel through western Maryland was difficult, as US40, the predecessor to I-68, was a two-lane country road with steep grades and hairpin <b>turns.</b> <b>In</b> Cumberland, the traffic situation was particularly problematic, as {{the usage of}} US40 exceeded {{the capacity of the}} city's narrow streets. Traffic following US40 through Cumberland entered through the Cumberland Narrows and followed Henderson Avenue to Baltimore Avenue. After the construction of I-68, this route through Cumberland became US40 Alternate (US40 Alt.).|$|E
5|$|As a {{preparation}} for the World Championships in Tuscany Van Dijk went during the season {{a few times to}} Italy to practise the time trial course. She trained at five in the morning to avoid traffic and made video recordings of the course {{to get to know the}} <b>turns.</b> <b>In</b> the week before the World Championships she won the French time trial Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen. All the preparations paid off and the World Championships were very successful for Van Dijk. With her team she won for the second consecutive year the world title in the team time trial. Because Van Dijk had won almost all the time trials this year she was also the main favourite for the individual time trial. Despite the pressure she won the time trial with a convincing victory and became the second Dutch women to win this title. At the end of the championships, Van Dijk finished 16th on a non-preferable hilly road race course.|$|E

5|$|By 1914, a paved county road {{connected}} Vallejo and Benicia {{north of}} the Carquinez Strait, following the present Maine Street, Benicia Road, Columbus Parkway, and K Street. Although state highways were designated to Benicia in 1910 (Legislative Route (LRN) 7, now I-680) and Vallejo in 1931 (LRN 74, now SR 29), this connection was not added until 1935, when LRN 74 (an unsigned designation) was extended east from Vallejo to Benicia and north along former Route 7 to Fairfield. (A short spur connecting Vallejo to the Carquinez Bridge was added to Route 74 in 1937.) LRN 74 initially entered Benicia on K Street and left on East Fifth Street, making several <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> between. Two realignments {{were built in the}} 1940s, reducing the number of turns to one, at the corner of L and East Second Streets.|$|E
5|$|Concentric castles {{were widely}} copied across Europe, for {{instance}} when Edward I of England– who had himself been on Crusade– built castles in Wales {{in the late}} 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded had a concentric design. Not all {{the features of the}} Crusader castles from the 13thcentury were emulated in Europe. For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the main gate in the side of a tower and for there to be two <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this bent entrance to be found in Europe.|$|E
5|$|During the 17 May 1992 Fairchild air show, Holland {{was again}} the command pilot of the B-52 aerial-demonstration flight. During the demonstration, Holland's {{aircraft}} again violated several safety regulations, including several low-altitude, steep <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> excess of 45° of bank {{and a high}} pitch angle climb, estimated at over 60° nose high which Holland finished with a wingover maneuver. The new wing commander, Colonel Michael G. Ruotsala, apparently took no action. One week later, the new DO, Colonel Capotosti, on his own initiative warned Holland that if he violated any more safety regulations, Capotosti would ground him (remove him from flying status). Capotosti did not document his warning to Holland or take {{any other kind of}} formal action.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers widened, straightened, and deepened the canal. As part {{of their}} work, the agency {{constructed}} a vertical lift bridge across the canal. Between 1924 and 1926, the Maryland State Roads Commission constructed approaches to the new bridge {{on both sides of}} the expanded canal, eliminating two narrow and dangerous bridges and four right-angle <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> Chesapeake City. The new route along George Street and Lock Street, which became part of US 213 in 1927 and is now MD 285 and MD 537, entirely bypassed what is now MD 284. After the tanker Franz Klasen destroyed the vertical lift bridge on July 28, 1942, the Maryland State Roads Commission established a ferry service across the canal. Between 1946 and 1949, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed the present tied arch Chesapeake City Bridge and new approach roads to the bridge.|$|E

5|$|The highway briefly {{parallels}} Fall Creek; however, it soon splits to {{the southeast}} at a junction with CR103 (Groton City Road). From here, NY222 continues on a generally southeasterly alignment along {{the base of a}} rural valley to the Tompkins–Cortland county line. Now in the town of Cortlandville, the route loses the Cortland Road name as it curves eastward to match similar <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> the course of the valley. The highway follows a winding course until the surrounding gully empties into the much wider Tioughnioga River valley, where the route straightens out and intersects with CR119 (Sears Road). East of this point, NY222 begins to run northeastward past homes as it approaches Cortland County–Chase Field Airport. The route provides direct access to the airport and subsequently meets NY281 (West Road) at the northeastern tip of the airport property.|$|E

5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E
5|$|R.C. Pro-Am II was {{developed}} by Rare and published by Tradewest. It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in December1992. Nintendo Power praised the game's controls and upgrade options, which made the game strategic. The magazine criticized the difficulty as unfair, with aircraft hazards that gave players no reaction time in which to dodge attacks. Nintendo Magazine System praised the game overall and its multiplayer in particular, but felt that better games were available. In 1993, GamePro said that the game was better than its predecessor, but noted that the graphics and sound could have been better. Jeuxvideo.com appreciated how the sequel's cars had better traction, but thought the game was technically unrefined considering its few advances in four years' time. For example, they criticized Rare for recycling the original game's audio. In 1994, Game Players had high praise for the game's multiplayer, screeching sound effects, vehicle handling, and replay value. They criticized its lack of in-game music and current weapon indicators, and struggled to anticipate <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> the track in the game's angled perspective.|$|E
5|$|State Route 190 {{begins at}} State Route 99 {{just south of}} {{downtown}} Tipton in Tulare County and heads straight east along the flat San Joaquin Valley on Avenue 144. There is a short expressway segment in Porterville, including a cloverleaf interchange at State Route 65 and a partial interchange at Main Street, after which the highway begins to curve alongside the Tule River, passing {{the south side of}} Lake Success, as the terrain becomes more rugged. Following the river, it meets the south end of County Route J37, an access road to Balch Park in the Mountain Home State Forest, at the forks of the river near the community of Springville. SR 190 continues east near the Middle Fork and South Fork Middle Fork Tule River to near Camp Nelson, where it begins rising into the foothills, going around many hairpin <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> order to rise to Quaking Aspen, the source of the South Fork Middle Fork {{and the end of the}} western segment of SR 190.

Soon afterward a swarm of bees attacks a school in Columbia, South Carolina, and one of the teachers dies as a result. Skinner heads to the hospital, where he is met by Covarrubias. She demands to know what he knows about the matter. He tells her he believes that the bees are being used as a carrier for some sort of experiment. Skinner returns home where he is confronted by Mulder, who now suspects that Skinner has been working against him all this time. Skinner is able to convince Mulder that he would not have forced his own drawer lock open and hence could not have been the murderer. Convinced of Skinner's evidence, Mulder <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> the gun with the serial number filed off so Skinner is not blamed for the murder.
