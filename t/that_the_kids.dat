According to producer John Lloyd, Ben Elton was particularly keen on the choice of the Elizabethan age for the series, because it was [...] "a sexy age <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> can relate to." [...] As a stand-up comic, Elton often acted as the studio warm-up comic to amuse the audience before filming began. The scripts were also tightened up during principal rehearsals with the actorsaccording to Richard Curtis, a whole script for a murder mysterystyle episode was dropped because the writers felt it did not work.|$|E

Series co-creator Ryan Murphy explained to The Hollywood Reporter the use of the viral hit as a tribute to popular culture. He said: [...] "There’s a rule for it that's explained in the show. The Glee Club is hired to perform songs for the prom and they were told by the principal to please do popular songs <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> know." [...] Murphy noted that Glees [...] "Friday" [...] cover offers a different take since it's sung by males for other 17-year-olds. The show pays tribute to pop culture and, love it or hate it, that song is pop culture." ...|$|E

5000|$|Interpreting [...] a Midrash {{taught that}} God tested Moses through his {{experience}} as a shepherd.

Moses reasoned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> had run away because it was thirsty and concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> must be weary. So Moses carried <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> back on his shoulder. Thereupon God decided that because Moses had mercy leading a person's flock, Moses would assuredly tend God's flock Israel. Hence [...] says, [...] "Now Moses was keeping the flock." ...|$|R
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an {{excellent}} review, {{giving it a}} B. In her recap, she points out: [...] "With “Souls Of The Departed” Once Upon a Time, believe it or not, has just crossed a key threshold: 100 episodes. For all this show's inanities and love of catchphrases and gaping plot holes where logic should exist, there's clearly something very compelling about Storybrooke and its residents that resonates with viewers. In my own home, it's a decent family watch, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> find intriguing and even occasionally scary enough not to be lame, and the adults in the house can still take an interest. And the show still finds surprising mileage out of turning fairy tale tropes on their ear, or offering different sides of characters {{we think we know}} well." ...|$|E

As the NBA was declining, the ABA inherited many of its tracks and members making the ABA within two years the largest, albeit youngest, and the first truly nation-spanning sanctioning body. It was the ABA which introduced the [...] "Direct Transfer System" [...] that shortened the duration of race events. The ABA also started the team trophy concept to award trophies and prizes to the bicycle shop and factory teams with the best race results over a season. It was also the first to install electronic gates for its starting line with [...] "Christmas tree" [...] style lights (reminiscent of drag racing), to ensure fairer starts. It also started the BMX Hall of Fame, now called the National BMX Hall of Fame, recognizing the pioneers and industry visionaries of the sport.|$|E

50|$|As {{noted above}} {{concerning}} the ending, {{the most common}} interpretation of <b>the</b> novel is <b>that</b> Holden kills <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> in a Fort Griffin, Texas, outhouse. <b>The</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid's</b> death is not depicted might be significant. Blood Meridian is a catalog of brutality, depicting, in sometimes explicit detail, all manner of violence, bloodshed, brutality and cruelty.
