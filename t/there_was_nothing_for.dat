The defenses at Nyborg was in no condition to withstand a siege. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> the Swedish to do but to surrender, forcing 5,000 men into captivity; Sweden had suffered a devastating defeat.|$|E
5|$|Sources for William's actions between 1082 and 1084 are meagre. According to the {{historian}} David Bates, this probably means that little happened of note, and that because William {{was on the}} continent, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to record. In 1082 William ordered the arrest of his half-brother Odo. The exact reasons are unclear, as no contemporary author recorded what caused the quarrel between the half-brothers. Orderic Vitalis later recorded that Odo had aspirations to become pope. Orderic also related that Odo had attempted to persuade some of William's vassals to join Odo on an invasion of southern Italy. This {{would have been considered}} tampering with the king's authority over his vassals, which William would not have tolerated. Although Odo remained in confinement for the rest of William's reign, his lands were not confiscated. More difficulties struck in 1083, when William's eldest son Robert rebelled once more with support from the French king. A further blow was the death of Matilda, William's wife, on 2 November 1083. William was always described as close to his wife, and her death would have added to his problems.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{did not ask}} federal marshals {{to carry}} out the decision, as had become standard. Worcester thus imposed no {{obligations}} on Jackson; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> him to enforce. This may be seen as a prudential decision, for avoiding the possibility of political conflict between the Court and the Executive, while still delivering {{what appeared to be a}} pro-Indian decision.|$|E

25|$|Forgetting the raw gas {{burns on}} his own arm, Haile Selassie retired into his Palace for a final conference with his chieftains. It was clear {{to him that the}} Government of the Ethiopian Empire would have to move from Addis Ababa. One {{possibility}} was for the government to relocate to Gore in the southwest and he sought comment on this plan. Initially his bearded chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs did talk, they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left was fighting for its life under Ras Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. They added that the tribes to the west were in an ugly mood. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was and to say that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> the Emperor to do but run for his life.|$|E
25|$|From his spies Waller learnt it was possible, if a {{bold and}} sudden attack was made, that Hereford might be taken. Such workWaller loved, and he {{determined}} to try. With about 2,500 men {{he set out}} from Gloucester, and at daybreak on the 24 April appeared before Hereford. Some desultory fighting went on during the day, at times rather sharp, but the garrison had no heart in their resistance and deserted, so that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> Sir Richard Cave, the governor of Hereford, to do but to surrender. This he did, and on 25 April 1643. Waller entered Hereford in triumph. He was entitled to every credit that belongs to a bold and successful leader, and had more than restored {{his reputation as a}} conqueror. He had struck unexpectedly, and struck hard, with the result that he had dealt a blow where least expected, and one which was of considerable tactical importance, as he had severed the King's line of communication with Wales.|$|E
500|$|Additional {{controversy}} developed {{after the}} battle about Pickett's personal location during the charge. The fact that fifteen of his officers and all three of his brigadier generals were casualties while Pickett managed to escape unharmed led many to question his proximity to the fighting and, by implication, his personal courage. The 1993 film Gettysburg depicts him observing on horseback from the Codori Farm at the Emmitsburg Road, {{but there is no}} historical evidence to confirm this. It was established doctrine in the Civil War that commanders of divisions and above would [...] "lead from the rear", while brigade and more junior officers were expected to lead from the front, and while this was often violated, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> Pickett to be ashamed of if he coordinated his forces from behind.|$|E

500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, American {{companies}} were producing simple home computer kits {{such as the}} MITS Altair and IMSAI 8080. This aroused interest among electronics hobbyists in the UK but relatively high prices and lower disposable income reduced {{the appeal of the}} American products. New Scientist stated in 1977 that [...] "the price of an American kit in dollars rapidly translates into the same figure in pounds sterling by the time it has reached the shores of Britain". Off-the-shelf personal computers were also available for {{the high end of the}} market but were extremely expensive; Olivetti's offering cost £2,000, and the Commodore PET, launched in 1979, sold for £700. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> the hobbyist at the low end of the market.

[...] The New York Dramatic Mirror praised the production and commented on the clear adaptation of Shakespeare's work, resulting in an unusually clear presentation of the story. Another review in The Moving Picture World praised the film in a follow-up to the first review, commenting on the ephemeral nature of the productions by saying [...] "Few, indeed, will be the releases of the month to surpass this, and few, indeed, are the pictures that seem so complete and in every way satisfactory." ...|$|E

Several days later, in an {{interview on}} CNN together with James Zogby, Tancredo said that the attack was mentioned merely as a hypothetical response and insisted that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> which he should apologize.|$|E

2500|$|Milward Kennedy in {{his review}} in The Guardian of 21 September 1934 said after {{summarising}} the set-up of the plot that, [...] "Poirot has no part in this book; instead, {{a young man and}} a young woman who blend charm and irresponsibility with shrewdness and good luck contrive amusingly and successfully to usurp the functions of the police. The fault which I find is the overimportance of luck. For the villains it was, for example, singular good luck which enabled them to discover and identify an obscure vicar's fourth son asleep on a solitary picnic; it was very bad luck for them {{that he was able to}} assimilate a sixteenth times fatal dose of morphia. They were lucky, again, in having always at hand just the properties required to make an extempore murder seem something else; and as for the Bright Young Couple – but these are defects which are little noticeable in the gay stream of Mrs. Christie's narrative. Perhaps I should not have noticed them had I not read the book so quickly that, in a secluded village, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> it next day but to read it again with a sterner eye but no less enjoyment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Povestirile vieții, Lungu's {{scientific}} study of 2003, also marks his preoccupation with oral history as a path to investigating Romania's communist past, in particular the 1965-1989 regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu. Paul Cernat commends the work for breaking with the pattern of similar post-1989 recoveries, which mainly focus on interviews with political personalities. In contrast, Lungu's book centers on three study cases from working class environments—Florentina Ichim, Vasile Ariton and Petre Jurescu—whom the regime took pride in claiming were its support base. Their retrospective images of the era vary significantly, fluctuating between nostalgia and virulent anti-communism. However, all three witnesses recall having themselves resorted to alternative and illicit mechanisms of survival or self-promotion, in particular theft and political corruption. In his commentary on the interviews, Lungu concluded that, in some cases, the image of workers' lifestyles as offered by the propaganda apparatus was real, [...] "contrary to our expectations". He added, to Cernat's agreement: [...] "Overturning that which was officially stated during the epoch is not indicative of the real state of things and only drags us down into another ideology [...] That {{is why we have}} said: back to the facts!" [...] In his review of the book, literary critic Dan C. Mihăilescu resonated with such observations, noting their revelatory aspect: [...] "once confronted with the accounts , I convinced myself once and for all that the things which, under Ceaușism, I could still believe united us into a solidarity of suffering, are as false as can be. That is, even though we waited in grueling queues, in the same cold, for the same food rations, an ocean existed between the proletariat [...] and the intellectuals, between 'base and superstructure'. We were simply put two worlds, not just figuratively, but also effectively. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> us to sell and steal, whereas they had access to the circuits of theft, to the web of programmed lawlessness." ...|$|E
