The mechanism by which toxic Ca 2 + loading of cells occurs in the ischemic brain has become less clear as multiple human trials of glutamate antagonists have failed to show effective neuroprotection in stroke. Acidosis is a common feature of ischemia and is assumed to {{play a critical role}} in brain injury; however, the mechanism(s) remain ill defined. Here, we show that acidosis activates Ca 2 +-permeable acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), inducing glutamate receptor-independent, Ca 2 +-dependent, neuronal injury inhibited by ASIC <b>blockers.</b> <b>Cells</b> lacking endogenous ASICs are resistant to acid injury, while transfection of Ca 2 +-permeable ASIC 1 a establishes sensitivity.

Methods: Huh 7. 5 and LX- 2, alone or in co-culture with Huh 7. 5, were treated with 17 β-estradiol and genistein alone or {{in the presence of}} menadione and of estrogen receptors (ERs) and G protein-coupled-estrogenic-receptors (GPER) <b>blockers.</b> <b>Cell</b> viability, mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidant/antioxidant system were measured by specific kits. Western Blot was used for the analysis of Akt and p 38 -mitogen-activated-protein kinases (MAPK) activation and α-smooth-muscle actin expression.

40|$|G protein-coupled inward {{rectifier}} K+ (GIRK) channels represent novel {{targets for}} the development of new therapeutic agents. GIRK channels are activated by a large number of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and regulate the electrical activity of neurons, cardiac myocytes and β-pancreatic cells. Abnormalities in GIRK channel function have been implicated in the patho-physiology of neuropathic pain, drug addiction, cardiac arrhythmias and other disorders. However, the pharmacology of these channels remains largely unexplored. In this paper we describe the development of a screening assay for identifying new modulators of neuronal and cardiac GIRK channels. Pituitary (AtT 20) and cardiac (HL- 1) cell lines expressing GIRK channels were cultured in 96 -well plates, loaded with oxonol membrane potential-sensitive dyes and measured using a fluorescent imaging plate reader. Activation of the endogenous GPCRs in the cells caused a rapid, time-dependent decrease in the fluorescent signal; indicative of K+ efflux through the GIRK channels (GPCR stimulation versus control, Z’-factor = 0. 5 - 0. 7). As expected this signal was inhibited by addition of Ba 2 + and the GIRK channel toxin tertiapin-Q. To test the utility of the assay for screening GIRK channel <b>blockers,</b> <b>cells</b> were incubated for 5 minutes with a compound library of Na+ and K+ channel modulators. Ion transporter inhibitors such as 5 -(N,N-hexamethylene) -amiloride and SCH- 28080 were identified as blockers of the GIRK channel at sub-micromolar concentrations. Thus, the screening assay will be useful for expanding the limited pharmacology of the GIRK channel and in developing new agents for the treatment of GIRK channelopathies...|$|R
40|$|Tunneling {{nanotubes}} (TNTs) are {{recently discovered}} conduits for a previously unrecognized form of cell-to-cell communication. These nanoscale, F-actin–containing membrane tubes connect cells over long distances and facilitate the intercellular exchange of small molecules and organelles. Using optical membrane-potential measurements combined with mechanical stimulation and whole-cell patch-clamp recording, we demonstrate that TNTs mediate the bidirectional spread of electrical signals between TNT-connected normal rat kidney cells over distances of 10 to 70 μm. Similar results {{were obtained for}} other cell types, suggesting that electrical coupling via TNTs may be a widespread characteristic of animal cells. Strength of electrical coupling depended on the length and number of TNT connections. Several lines of evidence implicate a role for gap junctions in this long-distance electrical coupling: punctate connexin 43 immunoreactivity was frequently detected {{at one end of}} TNTs, and electrical coupling was voltage-sensitive and inhibited by meclofenamic acid, a gap-junction <b>blocker.</b> <b>Cell</b> types lacking gap junctions did not show TNT-dependent electrical coupling, which suggests that TNT-mediated electrical signals are transmitted through gap junctions at a membrane interface between the TNT and one cell of the connected pair. Measurements of the fluorescent calcium indicator X-rhod- 1 revealed that TNT-mediated depolarization elicited threshold-dependent, transient calcium signals in HEK 293 cells. These signals were inhibited by the voltage-gated Ca 2 + channel blocker mibefradil, suggesting they were generated via influx of calcium through low voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels. Taken together, our data suggest a unique role for TNTs, whereby electrical synchronization between distant cells leads to activation of downstream target signaling...|$|R

There is now compelling evidence that K+ channels {{play an important role}} in the control of programmed cell death. The aim of the present work was to investigate the involvement of K+ channels in the EtOH-induced cerebellar granule cell death and/or survival. At low and high concentrations, EtOH evoked membrane depolarization and hyperpolarization, respectively. Bath perfusion of EtOH (10 mM) depressed the I(A) (transient K+ current) potassium current whereas EtOH (400 mM) provoked a marked potentiation of the specific I(K) (delayed rectifier K+ current) current. Pipette dialysis with GTPgammaS or GDPbetaS did not modify the effects of EtOH (400 mM) on both membrane potential and I(K) current. In contrast, the reversible depolarization and slowly recovering inhibition of I(A) induced by EtOH (10 mM) became irreversible in the presence of GTPgammaS. EtOH (400 mM) induced prodeath responses whereas EtOH (10 mM) and K+ channel <b>blockers</b> promoted <b>cell</b> survival. Altogether, these results indicate that in cerebellar granule cells, EtOH mediates a dual effect on K+ currents partly involved in the control of granule cell death...|$|R

40|$|ADP-ribosylation is a posttranslational {{modification}} that modulates {{the functions}} of many target proteins. We previously showed that the fungal toxin brefeldin A (BFA) induces the ADP-ribosylation of C-terminal-binding protein- 1 short-form/BFA-ADP-ribosylation substrate (CtBP 1 -S/BARS), a bifunctional protein with roles in the nucleus as a transcription factor and in the cytosol as a regulator of membrane fission during intracellular trafficking and mitotic partitioning of the Golgi complex. Here, we report that ADP-ribosylation of CtBP 1 -S/BARS by BFA occurs via a nonconventional mechanism that comprises two steps: (i) synthesis of a BFA-ADP-ribose conjugate by the ADP-ribosyl cyclase CD 38 and (ii) covalent binding of the BFA-ADP-ribose conjugate into the CtBP 1 -S/BARS NAD(+) -binding pocket. This results in the locking of CtBP 1 -S/BARS in a dimeric conformation, which prevents its binding to interactors known {{to be involved in}} membrane fission and, hence, in the inhibition of the fission machinery involved in mitotic Golgi partitioning. As this inhibition may lead to arrest of the cell cycle in G 2, these findings provide a strategy for the design of pharmacological <b>blockers</b> of <b>cell</b> cycle in tumor cells that express high levels of CD 38...|$|R

The aim of the present study was to further explore the effects of Kv 1. 3 blockers on the response of different human T cell subsets under various stimulation conditions. Our studies show that, unlike the immune suppressor cyclosporine A, the inhibitory effect of Kv 1. 3 blockers was partial and stimulation strength dependent, with reduced inhibitory efficacy on T cells under strengthened anti-CD 3 /CD 28 stimulations. T cell responses to allergens including house dust mites and ragweed were partially reduced by Kv 1. 3 blockers. The effect of Kv 1. 3 inhibition was dependent on T cell subsets, with stronger effects on CCR 7 - effector memory compared to CCR 7 + central memory CD 4 T cells. Calcium entry studies also revealed a population of CD 4 T cells resistant to Kv 1. 3 blockade. Activation of CD 4 T cells was accompanied with an increase in Kv 1. 3 currents but Kv 1. 3 transcripts were found to be reduced, suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism in the regulation of Kv 1. 3 activities. In summary, Kv 1. 3 <b>blockers</b> inhibit T <b>cell</b> activation in a manner that is highly dependent on the T cell identity and stimulation strength, These findings suggest that Kv 1. 3 <b>blockers</b> inhibit T <b>cells</b> in a unique, conditional manner, further refining our understanding of the therapeutic potential of Kv 1. 3 blockers...|$|R

The modulation of cell effects of relevant agents were evaluated time-dependently by calculation of the cell proliferation based on cell counting. By applying the t-test and Bonferroni correction it could be attested that both growth factors are capable, time-dependant stimuli of RPE cells’ proliferation. A stronger effect could be ascribed to bFGF. Further on, the results provided an indication for the existence of a synergistic mitogenic effect between VEGF and bFGF. The application of both receptor blockers showed their inhibitory potential to significantly reduce proliferating effects induced by VEGF and bFGF. This could constitute a basis for therapeutic intervention. Despite selectivity both receptor <b>blockers</b> interacted with <b>cells</b> incubated with the other growth factor. An explanatory model is {{based on the idea that}} synergistic effects between VEGF and bFGF are realized by interactive trigger effects engaging endogenously synthesized and exogenic growth factors. Considering existing studies an interactive up-regulation by an increased amount of secretion and/or increased expression of a growth factor and its receptor as well as by modified receptor affinities can be presumed.

40|$|Calcium channel {{blockers}} {{correct in}} vitro mitochondrial toxicity of cellulose acetate. We studied {{the action of}} rinse solutions from cellulose acetate hemodialyzers on isolated mitochondria. We showed that concentrates from the rinses impaired the adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) synthesis as reflected by the decrease in respiration during state 3 and in P/O ratio. This impairment results from a calcium release from mitochondria that is induced by rinse solution concentrates. The release, triggering the mitochondrial calcium carrier, would explain the decrease in ATP synthesis. Moreover, rinse solution concentrates hinder mitochondrial calcium storage. The rise in cytosolic calcium in hemodialyzed patients may be related, at least in part, to these findings, since a lack of ATP impairs the ATP-dependent cellular calcium-extrusion pumps. We also showed that calcium channel blockers, at therapeutically relevant doses, restore ATP synthesis and calcium storage in mitochondria impaired by rinse solution concentrates. Finally, these in vitro results were confirmed by experiments on cells in culture proving that Diltiazem counteracts the cytotoxicity of rinse solution concentrates. These {{findings are consistent with}} observations that these drugs suppress the increase in leukocyte cytosolic calcium in dialyzed patients.

Here, we analyze effects of miR- 5096 on the Kir 4. 1 expression and function in two glioblastoma cell lines, U 87 and U 251. Using whole-cell patch-clamp and western-blot analysis, we show that cell loading with miR- 5096 decreases the Kir 4. 1 protein level and associated K+ current. Cell treatment with barium, a Kir 4. 1 <b>blocker,</b> or <b>cell</b> loading of miR- 5096 both increase the outgrowth of filopodia in glioma cells, as observed by time-lapse microscopy.

Two studies in this issue demonstrate the feasibility of curing spontaneous autoimmunity in animal models via short-term enhancement of naturally arising regulatory T (T reg) cells, a subset of CD 4 + T cells needed for maintaining self-tolerance. Importantly, these therapies seemed to generate a new equilibrium, or “set-point, ” at which self-tissue damage no longer occurred long after the drug was eliminated from the body. The development of novel biological therapies has fostered a renaissance in the treatment of autoimmune disease. For example, tumor necrosis factor– <b>blockers,</b> anti–B <b>cell</b> therapy, CTLA 4 imunoglobulin (Ig), and interleukin 6 (IL- 6) blockade, all introduced within the past decade, have made diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis much easier to control by limiting joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, as well as preventing joint damage and deformity (Smolen et al., 2010). However, because these treatments are not curative, years of therapy result in high costs for patients and the potential for serious infections, cancer, and other adverse outcomes.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of transient faults like soft errors in computer circuits poses a significant {{challenge to the}} reliability of computer systems. Soft error, which occurs when the energetic neutrons coming from space or the alpha particles arising out of packaging materials hit the transistors, may manifest themselves as a bit flip in the memory element or as a transient glitch generated at any internal node of combinational logic, which may subsequently propagate to and be captured in a latch. Although the problem of soft errors was earlier only a concern for space applications, aggressive technology scaling trends have exacerbated the problem to modern VLSI systems even for terrestrial applications. In this dissertation, we explore techniques {{at all levels of}} the design flow to reduce the vulnerability of VLSI systems against soft errors without compromising on other design metrics like delay, area and power. We propose new models for estimating soft errors for storage structures and combinational logic. While soft errors in caches are estimated using the vulnerability metric, soft errors in logic circuits are estimated using two new metrics called the glitch enabling probability (GEP) and the cumulative probability of observability (CPO). These metrics, based on signal probabilities of nets, accurately model soft errors in radiation-aware synthesis algorithms and helps in efficient exploration of the design solution space during optimization. At the physical design level, we leverage the use of larger netlengths to provide larger RC ladders for effectively filtering out the transient glitches. Towards this, a new heuristic has been developed to selectively assign larger wirelengths to certain critical nets. This reduces the delay and area overhead while improving the immunity to soft errors. Based on this, we propose two placement algorithms based on simulated annealing and quadratic programming which significantly reduce the soft error rates of circuits. At the circuit level, we develop techniques for hardening circuit nodes using a novel radiation jammer technique. The proposed technique is based on the principles of a RC differentiator and is used to isolate the driven cell from the driving cell which is being hit by a radiation strike. Since the blind insertion of radiation <b>blocker</b> <b>cells</b> on all circuit nodes is expensive, candidate nodes are selected for insertion of these cells using a new metric called the probability of radiation blocker circuit insertion (PRI). We investigate a gate sizing algorithm, at the logic level, in which we simultaneously optimize both the soft error rate (SER) and the crosstalk noise besides the power and performance of circuits while considering the effect of process variations. The reliability centric gate sizing technique has been formulated as a mathematical program and is efficiently solved. At the architectural level, we develop solutions for the correction of multi-bit errors in large L 2 caches by controlling or mining the redundancy in the memory hierarchy and methods to increase the amount of redundancy in the memory hierarchy by employing a redundancy-based replacement policy, in which the amount of redundancy is controlled using a user defined redundancy threshold. The novel architectures and the new reliability-centric synthesis algorithms proposed for the various design abstraction levels have been shown to achieve significant reduction of soft error rates in current nanometer circuits. The design techniques, algorithms and architectures can be integrated into existing design flows. A VLSI system implementation can leverage on the architectural solutions for the reliability of the caches while the custom hardware synthesized for the VLSI system can be protected against radiation strikes by utilizing the circuit level, logic level and layout level optimization algorithms that have been developed...|$|R

Resistance to this peptide and another toxic peptide derivative, {{which is based on}} a Thr-His-Thr-Nle-Glu-Gly backbone conjugated to butyl and benzyl groups (4 A 6), could be reversed by MRP 1 inhibitors. The reduced toxicity of 4 A 6 in MRP 1 -overexpressing cells was found to be associated with lower accumulation of a fluorescein-labeled derivative of this peptide. Glutathione (GSH) depletion had a clear effect on resistance to ALLN but hardly affected 4 A 6 resistance. In a limited structure-activity study using peptides that are analogous to 4 A 6, MRP 1 -overexpressing cells were found to be resistant to these peptides as well. Remarkably, when selecting A 2780 ovarian cancer cells for resistance to ALLN, {{even in the absence of}} Pgp <b>blockers,</b> resulting <b>cell</b> lines had up-regulated MRP 1, rather than any of the other currently known multidrug resistance transporter molecules including Pgp, MRP 2 (ABCC 2), MRP 3 (ABCC 3), MRP 5 (ABCCS), and the breast cancer resistance protein ABCG 2.

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that diversity in craniofacial morphology is produced by a complex interaction of environmental variables including 1) muscle function, 2) genetic factors related to skull growth, 3) timing and heritability of suture fusion (cessation of growth of the joints connecting {{the bones of the}} skull), 4) growth and morphology of the brain, and 5) other non-genetic factors including hormones of the endocrine system. How these factors interact in cranial growth and development is not well understood. This dissertation investigated the influence of androgenic hormone on suture bone biology. Methodology used including in vitro cellular challenges, protein analyses, and in vivo therapies. The work described here utilized a large sample size to establish the role of testosterone as a modulator of bone morphogenetic protein and subsequent effects on osteoblast differentiation. Testosterone increased the effect of BMP on osteoblasts, increasing differentiation. The increased differentiation effect was successfully blocked using flutamide, an androgen receptor <b>blocker.</b> Bone <b>cells</b> harvested from non suture calvaria in craniosynostotic rabbits were most susceptible to flutamide administration. The presence of androgen receptors in cells harvested from the suture and non suture bone of craniosynostotic or wild type rabbits could not be confirmed {{due to a lack of}} an effective antibody. In vivo administration of flutamide to the coronal suture of craniosynostotic rabbits resulted in greater growth across the coronal suture. However, no correction of craniofacial growth was observed. These results suggest 1) an alternative pathway for dihydrotestosterone's and testosterone's effect on the suture, similar to the adrenal androgens, via the MAP kinase pathway, 2) lack of an effective delivery system of the flutamide treatment, or 3) that an androgen receptor blocker-based therapy is not effective for delaying the eventual fusion of the coronal suture in this model...|$|R
30|$|HEK cells {{transfected}} with plasmid DNA {{were loaded}} with Ca 2 + sensitive dye Fura- 2  AM (Sigma), and a Fura- 2 based Ca 2 + imaging assay was performed using the Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope. Emission ratiometric images (F 340  nm:F 380  nm) were collected using MetaFluor Fluorescence Ratio Imaging Software (Molecular Devices). For the Glu treatments, Fura- 2 loaded HEK 293 cells were incubated {{in a standard}} buffer (pH  7.4) containing 130  mM NaCl, 3  mM KCl, 0.6  mM MgCl 2, 10  mM glucose, 10  mM HEPES and 1  mM Ca 2 + for 30  min. One hundred microliter Glu solution (30  mM) was dropped carefully into the 200  μl standard buffer (the final concentration of Glu was 10  mM), and the Fura- 2 ratiometric images were collected. For Ca 2 + channel <b>blocker</b> treatment, HEK <b>cells</b> were pretreated with LaCl 3 (1  mM) and incubated for 30  min before the Glu treatments. For control treatments, standard buffer solution and Asp solution were used instead of Glu. For data analysis, about 20 cells in one experiment were selected manually based on the increases in [Ca 2 +]i. All the experiments were repeated {{for at least three}} times.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Aldosterone {{has long}} been known to control water and {{electrolyte}} balance by acting on mineralocorticoid receptors in kidney. However, recent studies demonstrated the presence of these receptors in nonclassical locations, including the cardiovascular system. We tested the hypothesis whether endothelial cells respond to aldosterone with changes in cell volume, a measure for ion-mediated water movement across the cell membrane. By means of atomic force microscopy in fluid, we measured volume of adherent human umbilical venous endothelial cells exposed for 72 hours to 10 nmol/L aldosterone. Over this period of time, cells swell by 18 %. Aldosterone-induced swelling is prevented by 100 nmol/L of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone, added to the primary endothelial cell culture. Aldosterone-treated cells dramatically shrink when 1 mol/L of the diuretic amiloride is applied. Cells deprived of aldosterone do not respond to amiloride. Our conclusions are: (1) aldosterone leads to sustained cell swelling inhibited by administration of spironolactone or the sodium channel <b>blocker</b> amiloride; (2) <b>cells</b> respond to amiloride after aldosterone exposure; (3) renal diuretics act on endothelial cells; and (4) both amiloride and spironolactone could be useful for medical applications to prevent aldosterone-mediated endothelial dysfunction.

40|$|Acute {{dilation}} of {{the right}} atrium (e. g., via increased venous return) raises spontaneous beating rate (BR) of the heart in many species. Neural mechanisms contribute to this behavior in vivo, but a positive chronotropic re-sponse to stretch can also be observed in isolated right atrial tissue prepara-tions and even {{at the level of}} single sino-atrial node (SAN) cells. The underlying mechanism has previously been reported to be compatible with stretch-activation of cation nonselective ion channels (SAC). This review reports species peculiar-ities in the chronotropic response of isolated SAN tissue strips to stretch: in contrast to guinea pig, murine SAN preparations respond to distension with a reduction in spontaneous BR. This differential response need not necessarily involve disparate (sub-) cellular mechanisms, as SAC activation would occur against the background of very different SAN electrophysiology in the two spe-cies. On the basis of single SAN cell action potential recordings, this review il-lustrates how this may give rise to potentially opposing effects on spontaneous BR. Interestingly, streptomycin (a useful SAC <b>blocker</b> in isolated <b>cells)</b> has no effect on stretch-induced chronotropy in situ, and this is interpreted as an in-dication of protection of SAC, in native tissue, from interaction with the drug...|$|R
40|$|ADP-ribosylation is a posttranslational {{modification}} that modulates {{the functions}} of many target proteins. We previously showed that the fungal toxin brefeldin A (BFA) induces the ADP-ribosylation of C-terminal-binding protein- 1 short-form/BFA-ADP-ribosylation substrate (CtBP 1 -S/BARS), a bifunctional protein with roles in the nucleus as a transcription factor and in the cytosol as a regulator of membrane fission during intracellular trafficking and mitotic partitioning of the Golgi complex. Here, we report that ADP-ribosylation of CtBP 1 -S/BARS by BFA occurs via a nonconventional mechanism that comprises two steps: (i) synthesis of a BFA-ADP-ribose conjugate by the ADP-ribosyl cyclase CD 38 and (ii) covalent binding of the BFA-ADP-ribose conjugate into the CtBP 1 -S/BARS NAD+-binding pocket. This results in the locking of CtBP 1 -S/BARS in a dimeric conformation, which prevents its binding to interactors known {{to be involved in}} membrane fission and, hence, in the inhibition of the fission machinery involved in mitotic Golgi partitioning. As this inhibition may lead to arrest of the cell cycle in G 2, these findings provide a strategy for the design of pharmacological <b>blockers</b> of <b>cell</b> cycle in tumor cells that express high levels of CD 38.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIM—EAT/mcl- 1 (EAT), an {{immediate}} early gene, functions {{in a similar}} way to bcl- 2 in neutralising Bax mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting that EAT is a <b>blocker</b> of <b>cell</b> death. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of overexpression of the human EAT gene on light induced retinal cell apoptosis.  METHODS—EAT transgenic mice incorporating the EF- 1 α promoter were utilised, and expression of human EAT was detected by RT-PCR. Light damage was induced by raising mice under constant illumination. Two groups of animals, EAT transgenic mice (n= 14) and littermates (n= 13), were examined by ERG testing and histopathology at regular time points up to 20  weeks of constant light stimulation. Electrophysiological and histopathological findings were evaluated by established systems of arbitrary scoring as scores 0 - 2 and scores 0 - 3, respectively.  RESULTS—The mean score (SD) of ERG response was significantly lower in EAT transgenic mice (0. 79  (0. 89)) than in littermates (1. 69  (0. 48)) (p< 0. 01). Although the differences between the two survival curves did not reach statistical significance (p= 0. 1156), the estimated incidence of electrophysiological retinal damage was higher in EAT mice (0. 0495 /mouse/week; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 0347 - 0. 0500) than in littermates (0.   0199 /mouse/week; 95 % CI 0. 0035 - 0. 0364). The mean scores (SD) for histopathological retinal degeneration were 2. 31  (0. 63) in littermates and 1. 43  (1. 22) in EAT transgenic mice (p= 0. 065). However, Kaplan-Meier curves for histopathological failure in two groups of mice showed that retinal photoreceptor cells were preserved significantly against constant light in the littermate compared with transgenic mice (p= 0. 0241). The estimated incidence of histopathological retinal damage was 0. 0042 /mouse/week in the littermates (95 % CI 0 - 0. 0120) and 0. 0419 /mouse/week in the EAT mice (95 % CI 0. 0286 - 0. 0500).  CONCLUSION—Retinal photoreceptor cell apoptosis under constant light stimulation is likely to be accelerated in transgenic retina overexpressing EAT. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{corticosteroids}} {{are very}} efficient in managing asthma and other inflammatory diseases, {{a small percentage}} of patients affected by “severe asthma” fail to respond even to high doses of oral glucocorticoids. It is therefore important to try to understand the potential mechanisms behind this insensitivity to corticosteroid therapy {{in order to be able}} to effectively control asthma in this patient subset. We have decided to focus on one particular channel called K[subscript Ca] 3. 1, a calcium-activated potassium channel. First, emerging evidence in the literature to date has strongly supported a significant role for K[subscript Ca] 3. 1 channel in the pathophysiology of asthma. K[subscript Ca] 3. 1 channel is expressed by several inflammatory and structural airway cells including mast cells and human bronchial smooth muscle (HBSM). Therefore these channels might serve as new targets for the treatment of lung diseases. Here we established a cellular model of corticosteroid insensitivity consisting of primary HBSM cells exposed to two cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ. Under these conditions, HBSMC exhibit a marked production of different pro-asthmatic chemokines like CCL 5, CX 3 CL 1, CCL 11 and CXCL 10 that are completely resistant to corticosteroid treatment. In this model, we found that although K[subscript Ca] 3. 1 channel expression did not change between healthy control, asthmatic and COPD subjects, K[subscript Ca] 3. 1 channel blockers (ICA- 17043 and TRAM- 34) were able to inhibit the production of corticosteroid-resistant chemokines either directly via the suppression of gene expression or indirectly via the restoration of the anti-inflammatory action of fluticasone. We also found that K[subscript Ca] 3. 1 channel <b>blockers</b> restored <b>cell</b> sensitivity to corticosteroid in cytokine-treated HBSMC by re-establishing the transactivation function of fluticasone via the prevention of dephosphorylation of Glucocorticoid Receptors (GRα) at Ser[superscript 211] and induction of anti-inflammatory genes such as Glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ). The likely mechanism of this restoration of corticosteroid sensitivity by K[subscript Ca] 3. 1 channel blockers is via the inhibition of protein phosphatase 5 (PP 5) expression found to be up-regulated in steroid resistant conditions...|$|R
40|$|Major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) class I antigens on tumour cell surfaces {{have been shown}} to modulate target susceptibility to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated lysis in some, although not all, systems investigated. MHC class II expression may also affect NK cell function, but the mechanism by which MHC class II antigen regulates NK cell activity has not been fully examined. In this study we induced HLA-DR 1 expression by gene transfection into the classic NK-sensitive K 562 cell line to study the interaction of NK cells with MHC class II molecules and the effect of brefeldin-A (BFA), an endogenous antigen-processing pathway <b>blocker,</b> on NK-target <b>cell</b> interaction. We demonstrated that the expression of HLA-DR 1 on the cell surface reduced K 562 cell susceptibility to NK lysis by peripheral blood monuclear cells and a NK cell line. The effect was demonstrable in prolonged (8 hr) cytotoxicity assays and was blocked by pretreatment of target cells with anti-HLA-DR antibody. Treatment of K 562 DR transfectant with BFA abrogated the resistance of K 562 transfectant to NK-mediated cytolysis. These findings indicate that HLA class II molecules regulate NK cell function and target recognition, and suggest that endogenous peptides presented through MHC molecules are responsible for regulating NK cytolysis...|$|R
40|$|Recent reports {{suggest that}} N-methyl-d-aspartate {{receptor}} (NMDAR) blockade by MK- 801 decreases tumor growth. Thus, we investigated whether other ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) antagonists were {{also able to}} modulate the proliferation of melanoma cells. On the other hand, the antiestrogen tamoxifen (TAM) decreases the proliferation of melanoma cells, and is included in combined therapies for melanoma. As the efficacy of TAM is limited by its metabolism, we investigated {{the effects of the}} NMDAR antagonist MK- 801 in combination with TAM and its active metabolites, 4 -hydroxytamoxifen (OHTAM) and endoxifen (EDX). The NMDAR blockers MK- 801 and memantine decreased mouse melanoma K 1735 -M 2 cell proliferation. In contrast, the NMDAR competitive antagonist APV and the AMPA and kainate receptor antagonist NBQX did not affect cell proliferation, suggesting that among the iGluR antagonists only the NMDAR channel <b>blockers</b> inhibit melanoma <b>cell</b> proliferation. The combination of antiestrogens with MK- 801 potentiated their individual effects on cell biomass due to diminished cell proliferation, since it decreased the cell number and DNA synthesis without increasing cell death. Importantly, TAM metabolites combined with MK- 801 promoted cell cycle arrest in G 1. Therefore, the data obtained suggest that the activity of MK- 801 and antiestrogens in K 1735 -M 2 cells is greatly enhanced when used in combination...|$|R
