5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered <b>the</b> <b>shutter,</b> then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E
5|$|Galileo is lesser known for, {{yet still}} {{credited}} with, {{being one of}} the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E
5|$|The Confederate ironclad Tennessee {{attacked}} Farragut's wooden ships {{without much}} effect {{after they had}} passed the Confederate forts and she was engaged by Winnebago before she disengaged and briefly took shelter under Fort Morgan's guns. About a half-hour later, the ironclad attacked Farragut's ships again. The monitors were not initially engaged, but Chickasaw managed to assume a position by the Tennessees stern and fired repeatedly at point-blank range. Her shots failed to penetrate the Tennessees armor, but they did jam the armored shutter for the stern gun port and cut her exposed steering chains, rendering her unable to steer. When the crew attempted to unjam <b>the</b> <b>shutter,</b> one shell struck the edge of <b>the</b> <b>shutter,</b> creating fragments that killed the machinist attempting to knock out the shutter's retaining pin and broke Admiral Franklin Buchanan's leg. This damage, together with damage inflicted by the other Union ships, persuaded Commander James D. Johnston to surrender his ship. The two monitors remained in Mobile Bay and subsequently bombarded Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines until they surrendered {{less than three weeks}} later.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the {{palettes}} were {{manipulated by}} a ratchet swell, a lever {{operated by the}} foot {{to the side of}} the console. The lever would fit into two or three different notches, which would lock the position of the lever, and therefore <b>the</b> <b>shutters,</b> in place. To change the position of <b>the</b> <b>shutters,</b> <b>the</b> lever would be kicked sideways to allow it to travel into a new position. The lever was weighted so that its default position was at the top, with <b>the</b> <b>shutters</b> closed. As <b>the</b> lever was lowered, <b>the</b> <b>shutters</b> would open.|$|R

5|$|Toyo Miyatake, who {{was born}} in Kagawa, Shikoku, Japan, in 1896, immigrated to the United States in 1909. He settled in the Little Tokyo section of Los Angeles, and was incarcerated at Manzanar along with his family. A photographer, Miyatake smuggled a lens and film holder into Manzanar and later had a {{craftsman}} construct a wooden box with a door that hid the lens. He took many now-famous photos of life and the conditions at Manzanar. His contraband camera was eventually discovered by the camp administration and confiscated. However, camp director Ralph Merritt later allowed Miyatake to photograph freely within the camp, even though he was not allowed to actually press <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> button, requiring a guard or camp official to perform this simple task. Merritt finally saw no point to this technicality, and allowed Miyatake to take photos.|$|E
25|$|Focusing can be manual, by {{twisting}} {{the focus on}} the lens; or automatic, activated by pressing half-way on <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> release or a dedicated AF button. To take an image, the mirror swings upwards {{in the direction of the}} arrow, the focal-plane shutter (3) opens, and the image is projected and captured on the image sensor (4), after which actions, <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> closes, the mirror returns to the 45-degree angle, and the built in drive mechanism re-tensions <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> for the next exposure.|$|E

For {{mechanical}} Minox 8x11 cameras, a separate shutter speed dial sets <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed from 1/2 to 1/1000 second, plus B and T (BL has no documented T). For electromagnetic shutter cameras, <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> dial starts with 1/15 sec, {{and ends with}} 1/1000 (Minox C), or starts with 1/30 and ends with 1/2000 (Minox LX/TLX/CLX); the electromagnetic Minox camera also has an 'A' setting for automatic exposure, controlled by the built-in CdS (Minox C) or Spd (Minox LX/TLX) exposure meter.|$|E
25|$|Aperture {{priority}} is a semi-automatic shooting mode used in cameras.

25|$|ETC {{announced}} in 2012 {{a range of}} Source Four bodies using LEDs, including a model specified as being a direct replacement (in terms of light output) for the HPL tungsten Source Four. <b>The</b> <b>shutter</b> barrel and lens tubes are interchangeable with the HID and tungsten versions of the Source Four. Control of parameters such as colour and light intensity is available via DMX. The power usage is approximately 25% of that of the equivalent tungsten version, although the purchase cost is significantly higher. Lamp life is significantly higher at 50,000 hours to 70% intensity.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} way as one f-stop {{corresponds}} to a factor of two in light intensity, shutter speeds are arranged so that each setting differs in duration by a factor of approximately two from its neighbour. Opening up a lens by one stop allows twice as much light to fall on the film in a given period of time. Therefore, to have the same exposure at this larger aperture as at the previous aperture, <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> would be opened for half as long (i.e., twice the speed). The film will respond equally to these equal amounts of light, since it has the property of reciprocity. This is less true for extremely long or short exposures, where we have reciprocity failure. Aperture, shutter speed, and film sensitivity are linked: for constant scene brightness, doubling the aperture area (one stop), halving <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed (doubling the time open), or using a film twice as sensitive, has the same effect on the exposed image. For all practical purposes extreme accuracy is not required (mechanical shutter speeds were notoriously inaccurate as wear and lubrication varied, with no effect on exposure). It is not significant that aperture areas and shutter speeds do not vary by a factor of precisely two.|$|E
25|$|Norwich's {{geographical}} isolation {{was such}} that until 1845, when a railway connection was established, it was often quicker to travel to Amsterdam by boat than to London. The railway was introduced to Norwich by Morton Peto, who also built the line to Great Yarmouth. From 1808 to 1814, Norwich had a station in <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> telegraph chain that connected the Admiralty in London to its naval ships in the port of Great Yarmouth. A permanent military presence {{was established in the}} city with the completion of Britannia Barracks in 1897. The Bethel Street and Cattle Market Street drill halls were built around the same time.|$|E

25|$|For a long time, DSLRs offered {{faster and}} more {{responsive}} performance, with less shutter lag, faster autofocus systems, and higher frame rates. Around 2016-17, specific mirrorless camera models started offering competitive or superior specifications in these aspects. The downside of these cameras being {{that they do not}} have an optical viewfinder, making it difficult to focus on moving subjects or in situations where a fast burst mode would be beneficial. Other digital cameras were once significantly slower in image capture (time measured from pressing <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> release to the writing of the digital image to the storage medium) than DSLR cameras, but this situation is changing with the introduction of faster capture memory cards and faster in-camera processing chips. Still, compact digital cameras are not suited for action, wildlife, sports and other photography requiring a high burst rate (frames per second).|$|E
25|$|During {{this same}} year White and Stieglitz {{undertook}} an artistic experiment {{in which they}} jointly created a series of photographs of two models, Mabel Cramer and another known only as Miss Thompson. Stieglitz offered suggestions about posing the models, White focused the camera, and {{one or the other}} of them would snap <b>the</b> <b>shutter.</b> White also developed the negatives and printed the photographs. One of the intentions of the experiment was to try a variety of printing techniques and papers, including platinum, gelatin silver and gum bichromate prints. On a few signed of the prints they signed with a monogram that combined both of their initials. During this collaboration, White learned the Autochrome color process from Stieglitz, who had just returned from Europe with this technical knowledge. White and Stieglitz jointly created at least one Autochrome during this time, which they exhibited later in the year.|$|E
25|$|Two {{holes at}} the bottom left and right {{indicate}} whether the disk is write-protected and whether it is high-density; these holes are spaced as far apart as the holes in punched A4 paper, allowing write-protected high-density floppies to be clipped into standard ring binders. A notch at top right ensures that the disk is in the correct orientation and an arrow at top left indicating direction of insertion. The drive usually has a button that when pressed ejects the disk {{with varying degrees of}} force, the discrepancy due to the ejection force provided by the spring of <b>the</b> <b>shutter.</b> In IBM PC compatibles, Commodores, Apple II/IIIs, and other non-Apple-Macintosh machines with standard floppy disk drives, a disk may be ejected manually at any time. The drive has a disk-change switch that detects when a disk is ejected or inserted. Failure of this mechanical switch is a common source of disk corruption if a disk is changed and the drive (and hence the operating system) fails to notice.|$|E

However, Yūkei opened <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> out of curiosity, and when he peeked inside, there was a mountain of human bones piled up inside. Dumbfounded by this sight, Yūkei recalled a rumor of an onibaba at Adachigahara who would kill travelers and devour their blood and meat, and he got the feeling that this old lady was the rumored onibaba, so he fled the cave.|$|E

500|$|As for the Kinetoscope itself, {{there is}} a {{significant}} disagreement over the location of <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> providing the crucial intermittent visibility effect. According to a report by inventor Herman Casler described as [...] "authoritative" [...] by Hendricks, who personally examined five of the six still-extant first-generation devices, [...] "Just above the film,...a shutter wheel having five spokes and a very small rectangular opening in the rim [...] directly over the film. An incandescent lamp...is placed below the film...and the light passes up through the film, shutter opening, and magnifying lens...to the eye of the observer placed at the opening {{in the top of the}} case." [...] Robinson, on the other hand, says the shutter—which he agrees has only a single slit—is positioned lower, [...] "between the lamp and film". The Casler–Hendricks description is supported by the diagrams of the Kinetoscope that accompany the 1891 patent application, in particular, diagram 2. A side view, it does not illustrate <b>the</b> <b>shutter,</b> but it shows the impossibility of it fitting between the lamp and the film without a major redesign and indicates a space that seems suitable for it between the film and the lens. Robinson's description, however, is supported by a photograph of a Kinetoscope interior that appears in Hendricks's own book.|$|E
