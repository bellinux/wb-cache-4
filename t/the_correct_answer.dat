5|$|A {{drawing method}} found by Kazimierz Zarankiewicz has been conjectured to give <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> for every {{complete}} bipartite graph, and {{the statement that}} this is true {{has come to be}} known as the Zarankiewicz crossing number conjecture. The conjecture remains open, with only some special cases solved.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round, the contestants {{are asked to}} predict the most popular answer to each of three {{question}}s. Each question has three multiple choice options, and was asked {{to a group of}} 100 men. The panel is allowed to offer their opinion on <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> while the contestants submit their answers on their tablet computers. Each correct prediction is worth $200.|$|E
5|$|To {{begin the}} game, a {{category}} is revealed, {{and the three}} teams of three contestants are asked multiple choice questions under that category, with each question having four possible answers. The contestant who buzzes in with <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> earns the respective team 100 points; an incorrect answer loses 100 points, and opens up the question to the other teams. Contestants must {{wait until after the}} host reads the entire question (including the choices) to buzz in.|$|E
5000|$|The teacher {{monitors}} the activity {{to make sure}} students are getting <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Acrostic round: The {{first or}} last letters of <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> in this round form an acrostic ...|$|R
5000|$|Cash: the {{contestant}} answers {{without being}} given any choices and earns five points for giving <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the bout, the {{contestant}} {{with the}} higher score wins and either retains the Money Chair or replaces its current occupant. If the bout ends in a tie score, a tiebreaker question is asked; the contestant who locks in <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> first is the winner. If both of them miss, the contestant who has accumulated more money wins the bout. If a question is in play when the clock runs out, it is completed under the normal rules.|$|E
5|$|Negation is {{done with}} the adverb not, which precedes the main verb and follows an {{auxiliary}} verb. A contracted form of not -n't {{can be used as}} an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English I don't know him is <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> to the question Do you know him?, but not *I know him not, although this construction may be found in older English.|$|E
5|$|The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), {{also known}} as the Baby, was {{designed}} as a test-bed for the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory, rather than as a practical computer. Work on the machine began in 1947, and on 21 June 1948 the computer successfully ran its first program, consisting of 17 instructions written to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) by trying every integer from 218 − 1 downwards. The program ran for 52minutes before producing <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> of 131,072.|$|E
50|$|This was {{repeated}} for three mouths and noses, with the partners alternating. <b>The</b> second <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> added another $50, and <b>the</b> third <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> earned another $250 {{for a total}} of $500.|$|R
5|$|The {{third round}} {{consists}} of two questions. In season 1, the first required the team to rank three answers in a stated order and started with a value of $15,000. The second had an opening value of $25,000 and {{any or all of}} the answers could have been correct; the contestants had select all <b>correct</b> <b>answers,</b> and only <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> in order to get credit. Starting in season 2, the $15,000 question has two or all three <b>answers</b> being <b>correct,</b> and <b>the</b> team must select all of <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers,</b> and only <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> answers; <b>the</b> $25,000 question requires the team to rank the three <b>answers</b> in <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> order.|$|R
30|$|Table 10 {{indicates}} a tendency that <b>the</b> MI <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> appear in <b>the</b> good-rated question items {{more than in}} the bad-rated items, while it {{indicates a}}n opposite tendency for MD <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b> Note that <b>the</b> MI options are favourable for <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b> This means that the result of the ICRP analysis based on the test taker responses (evaluation 1) is consistent with the judgement by the human experts (evaluation 2).|$|R
5|$|The SSEM had a 32-bit {{word length}} and {{a memory of}} 32words (1 kilobit). As it was {{designed}} to be the simplest possible stored-program computer, the only arithmetic operations implemented in hardware were subtraction and negation; other arithmetic operations were implemented in software. The first of three programs written for the machine found the highest proper divisor of 218 (262,144), a calculation that was known would {{take a long time to}} run—and so prove the computer's reliability—by testing every integer from 218−1 downwards, as division was implemented by repeated subtraction of the divisor. The program consisted of 17instructions and ran for 52minutes before reaching <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> of 131,072, after the SSEM had performed 3.5million operations (for an effective CPU speed of 1.1 kIPS).|$|E
5|$|Before {{the bonus}} round begins, the winning {{contestant}} chooses {{one of three}} categories {{for his or her}} puzzle (prior to season 35, the puzzle and category were predetermined). After doing so, the contestant spins a smaller wheel with 24 envelopes to determine the prize. He or she is then shown a puzzle in the chosen category, and every instance of R, S, T, L, N, and E is revealed. The contestant provides three more consonants (four if he/she is holding the Wild Card) and one more vowel, then has 10 seconds to solve the puzzle after his or her other letters (if any) are revealed. The contestant may make as many guesses as necessary, so long as the contestant begins <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> before time expires. Whether or not the contestant solves the puzzle, the host opens the envelope {{at the end of the}} round to reveal the prize at stake. Prizes in the bonus round include various cash amounts (with the lowest being the season number multiplied by $1,000), a vehicle (or two vehicles during weeks with two-contestant teams), and a top prize of $100,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b> The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E
50|$|Spelling accuracy: loose, where players must type in {{the answers}} but may be awarded <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> if <b>the</b> {{computer}} knows what's being said.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2012, Sporcle {{released}} the [...] "clickable" [...] quiz, which {{is played by}} selecting <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> from a given set of choices, all displayed continuously, rather than typing.When specific questions or hints are used, they appear {{one at a time}} in sequence after the user selects the answer to the previous one. In this case only the answer corresponding to the specific question is accepted; buttons marked NEXT and PREV allow the player to postpone or return to a question, but a wrong answer prevents a return. In other quizzes <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> must be selected in a particular order without specific hints. Still other quizzes allow <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> to be clicked in any order, but some of the choices offered are wrong answers. If the quiz is not a [...] "minefield," [...] then the number of clicks is limited to <b>the</b> number of <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b> Still another variant, introduced later in 2012, requires choices from two or more different lists to be correctly associated.|$|R
50|$|The game's trivia {{questions}} {{include many}} errors. Many {{of these are}} due to <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> having changed since the game's release while others are simply errors.|$|R
5|$|At a Nintendo {{press conference}} in Tokyo, Japan on October 5, 2005, the company {{announced}} several games {{that it would be}} releasing in 2006 in Japan. The list included Brain Age 2, with a release date set for December 29, 2005. Nintendo later announced that the game would be released in Europe on June 29, 2007 for €30, and in Australia on July 5, 2007 for A$49.95. The American version of Brain Age 2 was first revealed in May 2007. The game is targeted to casual gamers, similar to its predecessor; its basic concepts stay the same as in , along with the graphics, menu, and presentation. Brain Age 2 also uses the same Sudoku engine, an addition in the original Brain Age that has been applauded for being one of the best handheld Sudoku games available; Brain Age 2s rendition of Sudoku introduces 100 new puzzles. All of the minigames in the game are new to the series; however, some of them are derived from exercises in Brain Age. One of the challenges in the first game, Head Count, requires that the player count how many people are shown on the screen; after a few seconds, a house falls on top of them, and then several people leave and enter the house. Afterward, the player must write down how many people they think are still in the house. A variation of this game is available in Brain Age 2, called Memory Sprint, which asks the player to observe a specific sprinter in a race as they pass other sprinters and are passed themselves, and then determine which place they finished in after they cross the finish line. The game's voice recognition technology has improved since the last game. The only challenge that uses the feature, Rock, Paper, Scissors, requires that the player speak <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> into the microphone as soon as possible.|$|E
25|$|Which {{is not too}} {{far from}} <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> of 23.|$|E
25|$|Las Vegas {{algorithms}} always return <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer,</b> {{but their}} running time is only probabilistically bound, e.g. ZPP.|$|E
5000|$|Contestants {{take part}} as {{individuals}} or in pairs or trios. They must choose <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> {{to a series}} of general knowledge questions that steadily increase in difficulty. For each <b>correct</b> <b>answer,</b> they are given a chance to guess one of the three digits in the code. If the team succeed in guessing all three numbers of the code, they win the money - but if they answer any of the general knowledge questions incorrectly they forfeit the game and the prize rolls over to the next contestants. Lesley-Anne Brewis gives <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> and provides information about the questions as the show's in-game [...] "expert".|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> {{rates of}} <b>correct</b> diagnoses and of <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> to <b>the</b> listed {{questions}} about key points in clinical treatment {{of infectious diseases}} in the final examination were compared between the two groups.|$|R
50|$|Each {{contestant}} in turn has 60 {{seconds to}} answer as many questions as possible, with <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> all {{beginning with the}} same letter. The champion plays first, and a different letter is specified for each contestant. One second {{is added to the}} contestant's clock for every <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|R
25|$|Finally, upon {{termination}} of the algorithm, the result needs to be read off. In {{the case of a}} classical computer, we sample from the probability distribution on the three-bit register to obtain one definite three-bit string, say 000. Quantum mechanically, one measures the three-qubit state, which is equivalent to collapsing the quantum state down to a classical distribution (with the coefficients in the classical state being the squared magnitudes of the coefficients for the quantum state, as described above), followed by sampling from that distribution. This destroys the original quantum state. Many algorithms will only give <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> with a certain probability. However, by repeatedly initializing, running and measuring the quantum computer's results, the probability of getting <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> can be increased. In contrast, counterfactual quantum computation allows <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> to be inferred when the quantum computer is not actually running in a technical sense, though earlier initialization and frequent measurements are part of the counterfactual computation protocol.|$|E
25|$|Some people's intuition is {{that the}} answer is above 100,000. Most people's intuition is that it is in the {{thousands}} or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. <b>The</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> is 23.|$|E
25|$|Between {{each round}} (except after round two) {{there is a}} {{head-to-head}} challenge where the team is posed a question with a numerical answer. They are each given a numeric keypad, {{and the person who}} is furthest from <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> is eliminated.|$|E
5000|$|Brain Teasers: Glenn {{wraps up}} {{the failure of}} the mission by saying, [...] "Were you {{genuinely}} stumped? Or was it that moles thrive underground?" [...] During the mission, David is the one giving <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b>|$|R
3000|$|Ground truth route We {{carefully}} choose 1000 popular routes agreed by {{all three}} route-mining algorithms in each city {{as the ground}} truth. These routes are treated as <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> for <b>the</b> route recommendation request between corresponding places.|$|R
50|$|Three players {{compete for}} cash. They are shown five artists, each {{starting}} at 100 zlotys. The value increases by 10 zlotys {{until it reaches}} 200 zlotys if no one correctly identifies the song. The first person to buzz in and name that tune wins the cash value shown. Play continues until all five artists are used. Control {{is determined by the}} person who gave <b>the</b> last <b>correct</b> <b>answer,</b> and begins with the player in the middle. Whenever no <b>correct</b> guess occurs, <b>the</b> person {{to the right of the}} person who gave <b>the</b> last <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> (or first person if the third player gave <b>the</b> last <b>correct</b> <b>answer)</b> originally selected <b>the</b> next artist. This was later changed to so that the one who gave <b>the</b> last <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> would always pick the next artist if no guess occurred.|$|R
25|$|The game is {{typically}} {{played with a}} lockout buzzer system between at least two teams, usually consisting {{of four or five}} players each. Players are read questions and try to score points for their team by buzzing first and responding with <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The main {{article for}} this section recounts how, when the paradox was new and {{relatively}} unknown, even professional physicists had difficulty working out the solution. Two lines of reasoning lead to opposite conclusions. Both arguments, which are presented below, are flawed even though one of them yields <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The special {{values such as}} {{infinity}} and NaN {{ensure that}} the floating-point arithmetic is algebraically completed, such that every floating-point operation produces a well-defined result and will not—by default—throw a machine interrupt or trap. Moreover, the choices of special values returned in exceptional cases were designed to give <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> in many cases, e.g. continued fractions such as R(z) := 7 − 3/(z − 2 − 1/(z − 7 + 10/(z − 2 − 2/(z − 3)))) will give <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> in all inputs under IEEE-754 arithmetic as the potential divide by zero in e.g. R(3)=4.6 is correctly handled as +infinity and so can be safely ignored. As noted by Kahan, the unhandled trap consecutive to a floating-point to 16-bit integer conversion overflow that caused the loss of an Ariane 5 rocket {{would not have happened}} under the default IEEE 754 floating-point policy.|$|E
5000|$|Some Pencils are Smarter than People by Erwin A. Steinkamp - A {{young man}} {{purchases}} a pencil from a street vendor, and discovers, to his delight, {{that when he}} takes tests with the pencil, it always writes down <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> <b>answers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{person with}} <b>the</b> fewest <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> is then {{expelled}} from the show. In most series this process continues until only two contestants and the Mole remain. The winner is the person with <b>the</b> most <b>correct</b> <b>answers</b> in <b>the</b> final test {{and he or she}} gets all of the money earned during the previous stages of the game.|$|R
5000|$|The {{player with}} <b>the</b> last <b>correct</b> <b>answer</b> at <b>the</b> end of round one picks first.|$|R
