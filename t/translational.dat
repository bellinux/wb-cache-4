5|$|It is non-periodic, {{which means}} that it lacks any <b>translational</b> symmetry.|$|E
5|$|Although the Pythagorean tiling {{is itself}} {{periodic}} (it has a square lattice of <b>translational</b> symmetries) its cross sections {{can be used}} to generate one-dimensional aperiodic sequences.|$|E

5|$|The type, direction, intensity, and {{duration}} of forces all contribute to the characteristics and severity TBI. Forces that may contribute to TBI include angular, rotational, shear, and <b>translational</b> forces.|$|E
5|$|Tilings with <b>translational</b> {{symmetry}} in {{two independent}} directions {{can be categorized}} by wallpaper groups, of which 17 exist. It has been claimed that all seventeen of these groups are represented in the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. Though this is disputed, the variety and sophistication of the Alhambra tilings have surprised modern researchers. Of the three regular tilings two are in the p6m wallpaper group and one is in p4m. Tilings in 2D with <b>translational</b> symmetry in just one direction can be categorized by the seven frieze groups describing the possible frieze patterns. Orbifold notation {{can be used to}} describe wallpaper groups of the Euclidean plane.|$|E
5|$|Big Bang lattice model, {{states that}} the {{universe}} {{at the moment of}} the Big Bang consists of an infinite lattice of fermions, which is smeared over the fundamental domain so it has rotational, <b>translational</b> and gauge symmetry. The symmetry is the largest symmetry possible and hence the lowest entropy of any state.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has led to}} codon assignments of {{the genetic}} code that minimize the effects of mutations. A recent hypothesis suggests that the triplet code was derived from codes that used longer than triplet codons (such as quadruplet codons). Longer than triplet decoding would increase codon redundancy and would be more error resistant. This feature could allow accurate decoding absent complex <b>translational</b> machinery such as the ribosome, such as before cells began making ribosomes.|$|E
5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to take up foreign dsRNA and use it in the RNAi pathway. The effects of RNA {{interference}} can be both systemic and heritable in plants and C. elegans, although not in Drosophila or mammals. In plants, RNAi is thought to propagate by the transfer of siRNAs between cells through plasmodesmata (channels in the cell walls that enable communication and transport). Heritability comes from methylation of promoters targeted by RNAi; the new methylation pattern is copied in each new generation of the cell. A broad general distinction between plants and animals lies in the targeting of endogenously produced miRNAs; in plants, miRNAs are usually perfectly or nearly perfectly complementary to their target genes and induce direct mRNA cleavage by RISC, while animals' miRNAs tend to be more divergent in sequence and induce <b>translational</b> repression. This <b>translational</b> effect may be produced by inhibiting the interactions of translation initiation factors with the messenger RNA's polyadenine tail.|$|E
5|$|Some {{states of}} matter exhibit {{symmetry}} breaking, where the relevant {{laws of physics}} possess some symmetry that is broken. A common example is crystalline solids, which break continuous <b>translational</b> symmetry. Other examples include magnetized ferromagnets, which break rotational symmetry, and more exotic states such as the ground state of a BCS superconductor, that breaks U(1) phase rotational symmetry.|$|E
5|$|Surprisingly, {{variations}} {{in the interpretation of}} the genetic code exist also in human nuclear-encoded genes: In 2016, researchers studying the translation of malate dehydrogenase found that in about 4% of the mRNAs encoding this enzyme the stop codon is naturally used to encode the amino acids tryptophan and arginine. This type of recoding is induced by a high-readthrough stop codon context and it is referred to as functional <b>translational</b> readthrough.|$|E
5|$|GTRI {{opened an}} {{international}} office in Athlone, Ireland in June 2006. This effort was expanded when Georgia Tech, the National University of Ireland, Galway and the University of Limerick partnered in June 2010 {{to create a}} joint <b>translational</b> research institute. GTRI has several field offices that help with nearby on-site research and needs. These are in Dallas, Texas, Dayton, Ohio, Shalimar, Florida (near Eglin Air Force Base), Huntsville, Alabama, Jacksonville, Florida, Orlando, Florida, Panama City, Florida, Quantico, Virginia, San Diego, California, Tucson, Arizona, Warner Robins, Georgia (near Robins Air Force Base), and Arlington, Virginia/Washington, DC.|$|E

25|$|A {{rigid body}} has {{six degrees of}} freedom in the case of general spatial motion, three of them <b>translational</b> degrees of freedom and three {{rotational}} degrees of freedom.

25|$|Bravais lattices, also {{referred}} to as space lattices, describe the geometric arrangement of the lattice points, and therefore the <b>translational</b> symmetry of the crystal. The three dimensions of space afford 14 distinct Bravais lattices describing the <b>translational</b> symmetry. All crystalline materials recognized today, not including quasicrystals, fit in one of these arrangements. The fourteen three-dimensional lattices, classified by lattice system, are shown above.|$|E

25|$|Interference with post <b>translational</b> {{modifications}} or with {{targeting of}} viral proteins {{in the cell}} is also possible.|$|E
25|$|For {{partially}} complementary microRNAs to recognise their targets, nucleotides 2–7 of the miRNA (its 'seed region') must {{be perfectly}} complementary. Animal miRNAs inhibit protein {{translation of the}} target mRNA (this is present but less common in plants). Partially complementary microRNAs can also speed up deadenylation, causing mRNAs to be degraded sooner. While degradation of miRNA-targeted mRNA is well documented, whether or not <b>translational</b> repression is accomplished through mRNA degradation, <b>translational</b> inhibition, {{or a combination of}} the two is hotly debated. Recent work on miR-430 in zebrafish, as well as on bantam-miRNA and miR-9 in Drosophila cultured cells, shows that <b>translational</b> repression is caused by the disruption of translation initiation, independent of mRNA deadenylation.|$|E

25|$|During their research, Eigen and Schuster also {{considered}} types of protein and nucleotide coupling other than hypercycles. One such alternative {{was a model}} with one replicase that performed polymerase functionality {{and that was a}} <b>translational</b> product of one of the RNA matrices existing among the quasispecies. This RNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalysed the replication of sequences that had specific motifs recognized by this replicase. The other RNA matrices, or just one of their strands, provided <b>translational</b> products which had specific anticodons and were responsible for unique assignment and transportation of amino acids.|$|E
