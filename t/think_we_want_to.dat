2500|$|The Discovery Institute {{continues}} to deny allegations that its true agenda is religious, and downplays the religious source {{of much of}} its funding. In an interview of Stephen C. Meyer when ABC News asked about the Discovery Institute's many evangelical Christian donors the institute's public relations representative stopped the interview saying [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go down that path." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barbara Alyn Woods portrays Deb Scott, Dan's {{wife and}} Nathan's mother. Initially normal, she later becomes neurotic. Woods said, [...] "She's fun to play, I love Deb Scott, she's a well-rounded character. I can't say I'm {{a lot like}} her, but I think our desires are the same. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be career women and good moms– I hope I'm a bit more {{successful}} than she is." [...] Explaining their differences, Woods added, [...] "I've never done any drugs in my whole life, I've never even smoked a cigarette– that's where I'd start– lay off the drugs. I'm not a big drinker, so I'd lay off the booze. So, {{that would be a}} good start for a mom I would say. And I've never cheated on my husband." [...] Seventeen years of marriage to Dan have made Deb bitter, and she divorces him in season 3, her hatred of him once driving her to try to kill him. Deb battles an addiction to pills in season 2 and again in season 4, but overcomes it permanently the second time.|$|E
2500|$|... "Get Along" [...] {{deals with}} the damage inflicted by religious, racial and {{cultural}} intolerance, asking why the world can't just get along. It is a stripped back track with minimal instrumental accompaniment. Sebastian explained why he wrote the song, [...] "It sends your brain into overload when you are expecting your first child. It definitely makes you {{take a step back}} and try to gain some perspective on this world we live in". [...] "Big Bad World" [...] was written for his son Hudson who was born in March 2012. He said, [...] "It's about that promise we all make to our kids, but realise we don't have as much control as we <b>think.</b> <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> protect them from the big bad world, but the promise matters the most." [...] "Used to You" [...] is a song Sebastian wrote for his wife Jules. He said, [...] "I always say to her, 'I don't get used to you'. I still get back from tours and I'm still excited to see her. [...] We've been friends for 18 years, together for 13 years. I'm lucky".|$|E

5000|$|Kylie {{spoke about}} the novel, saying [...] "The fans seem to love it. That’s why we did it, characters' names are Lexi and Livia. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make Lex more like me and Livia more like Kendall, {{and they kind of}} evolved into their own characters." ...|$|R
2500|$|In November 2010, General Richards {{said there}} was no desire to [...] "open up another front" [...] in the Middle East but {{suggested}} that in future it [...] "might be" [...] necessary. David Cameron told Parliament that Britain would [...] "take every step to cut out the terrorist cancer that lurks in the Arabian Peninsula", but Gen Richards said an intelligence-led approach was the current strategy. Richards added: [...] "Clearly, the primary agencies dealing with this are our intelligence and security agencies. But the military are already helping with their [...] training. I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> open up another front there and nor do the Yemenis want us to do that. So we have to find other ways of doing these things and in the meantime making sure Afghanistan doesn't revert to becoming, if you like, a 'second Yemen' – that is the Army's primary duty at the moment. Our role is to remain very close to them, to help them where they most need it and in the meanwhile focus our efforts on Afghanistan and assisting Pakistan to ensure they don't become the threat Yemen is beginning to be.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Eric Fellner {{attempted}} to convince Pitt {{to remain in}} the film, but Pitt was in disagreement with the studio over changes that had been made to the script since he originally agreed to star. Talent agency CAA (which represents Pitt) maintained that he never signed off on the changes; Macdonald delayed filming by a week to perform a scene-by-scene review of the script with Pitt; by the end, the director told the actor [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make the same film." [...] When Pitt decided {{to drop out of the}} film he called the director himself to say so. Pitt preferred a version closer to the original Carnahan draft and wanted to postpone filming until after the resolution of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which would have enabled a further rewrite. The studio preferred to press on with production, and initially said it was to sue Pitt for reneging on his [...] "pay or play" [...] deal, which would have earned him $20million. Settlement talks later led to a thawing of relations between the parties. Pitt later said of the situation: [...] "I had definite beliefs of what [...] should be, and the director had his definite beliefs [...] we got up against this writers' strike where we couldn't fuse the two." ...|$|E

5000|$|It {{was on that}} tour Thin Lizzy that we {{realized}} there was really a lack of just straight up rock and roll records coming out these days. So I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make something that was, front to back, a very focused kind of a recording. A very efficient kind of recording. One that had good energy {{from the very beginning}} to the end.|$|R
5000|$|That’s more of {{a comment}} on America {{as a whole and}} television's {{standards}} and practices than it is on us. It is kind of absurd that in an episode where you see the inside of a bloated, water-logged corpse, you can't see so much as a butt cheek. That's the world we’re living in. But I think it's important to view the relationship between Maggie and Glenn in a certain light. I don’t <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> turn that into some kind of steamy, pornographic sex romp. Robert Kirkman ...|$|R

And that this community should be a single and lovable reality, inspired by a common idea, with a common fashion and aim.|$|E

[...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> stay after the circus people {{come for the}} lion and the chimpanzee." [...] And after some talking the young hunters offered the Spink crowd part of their food {{supplies}} {{and a few other}} things. This surprised Ham, Carl and the rest. They accepted the offer on the spot, and a better feeling prevailed between the boys than had for many months.|$|E

5000|$|The {{majority}} of the album was recorded at guitarist Dan Hawkins's home, Leeders Farm, in Norfolk. Discussing the album {{in comparison to the}} band's previous two studio albums, Permission to Land and One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back, drummer Ed Graham noted: [...] "I <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> all feel that the second Darkness album is a bit over produced and maybe lost its way in places, a bit. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> return to the form we were in; <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make something that was more like Permission to Land than the second album. There are a couple of songs on this new album that are actually really old songs that we played ten years ago when we first formed." ...|$|R

The message has since been changed to indicate that Mita and his wife would be opening separate official sites.

5000|$|Unlike the band's {{previous}} two studio albums, Something for the Weakened does not feature any electronica elements, with Pennycook noting that his Macbook broke prior to recording, and that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> all <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> move towards something {{which had a}} more human element to it." ...|$|R
500|$|The Beauty Process: Triple Platinum is the {{follow-up}} to L7's 1994 album Hungry for Stink, which {{was released by}} Slash Records in collaboration with Reprise Records, a major record label owned by the Warner Music Group. Hungry for Stink peaked at No. 172 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and coincided with the 1994 Lollapalooza music festival, where the band shared the stage with other successful acts including The Smashing Pumpkins and The Breeders. For their next album, L7 {{decided to take a}} less constrained approach than they took with their previous albums. According to singer and guitarist Donita Sparks, [...] "In the past, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> prove that <b>we</b> were tough cookies. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> show that <b>we</b> could rock harder than anyone. Now we're more secure. So we have more freedom. It's kind of liberating." ...|$|R

They explained: ...|$|R
5000|$|We have a {{slightly}} different culture, for us, the [...] "sacral family" [...] {{remains one of the}} company's core values. Our family is a traditional family. If gays like our pasta and our advertisings, they will eat our pasta; if they don't like that, they will eat someone else's pasta. You can't always please everyone not to displease anyone. I would not do a commercial with a homosexual family, not for lack of respect toward homosexuals - who {{have the right to do}} whatever they want without disturbing others - but because I don't agree with them, and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> talk to traditional families. The women are crucial in this.|$|E
5000|$|An {{official}} of the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) had set out its view of homosexuality in film: [...] "to {{the great majority of}} cinema-goers, homosexuality is outside their direct experience and is something which is shocking, distasteful and disgusting". Relph said that in Victim, by contrast: [...] "What I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> say is that the homosexual, although subject to a psychological or glandular variation from sexual normality, is a human being subject to all the emotions of other human beings, and as deserving of our understanding. Unless he sets out to corrupt others, it is wrong for the law to pillory him because of his inversion." [...] He said Victim was [...] "a story not of glands but of love." ...|$|E
5000|$|In December 2015, Stephany Folsom {{was hired}} {{to work on the}} script, and Cate Blanchett entered final {{negotiations}} to join the cast, while Hemsworth said that in order to prevent the character or film from becoming [...] "predictable", there was [...] "definitely a goal to do something unexpected... and really mix it up... I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get back to more of a sense of adventure and fun in the" [...] film. Feige revealed that Thor: Ragnarok would take [...] "place within the cosmos primarily which is to say, frankly, very little Earth," [...] a departure from the previous Thor films. He expanded, saying there were only three scenes on Earth, with [...] "80 to 90 percent taking place in the cosmos. Tonally and geographically {{there are a lot of}} different planets outside of the nine realms that we visit" [...] in the film.|$|E
5000|$|El Camino was {{recorded}} in Nashville, Tennessee, at Easy Eye Sound Studio, which was opened by guitarist/vocalist Dan Auerbach in mid-2010 after he relocated from the group's long-time hometown of Akron, Ohio. Carney spoke of how the success of Brothers impacted the follow-up record: [...] "For me, there were physical jitters about everything that was going on. Seeing how big the shows were getting, feeling like people were paying attention, kind of made me anxious, and I think that's {{part of the reason}} El Caminos songs are so fast. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> just muscle through it." [...] Despite the growing expectations of the band, Carney said that the El Camino recording sessions were much more relaxed than those for Brothers, during which he had been dealing with his divorce.|$|R
500|$|This episode {{marked the}} climax of the {{relationship}} between Maggie Greene and Glenn, in which they engage in sexual intercourse at a pharmacy. Writer Robert Kirkman insisted {{that it was important to}} view the storyline in a different perspective, explaining, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> turn that into some kind of steamy, pornographic sex romp." [...] "Cherokee Rose" [...] marked a turning point in the character development of Daryl Dixon. It contains a monologue that references the cherokee rose and its association to the Trail of Tears. The scene was devised and written by Evan Rielly. [...] "I was actually on set during the filming of that," [...] stated Kirkman. [...] "Almost every actor in the cast showed up, because they absolutely loved that scene and they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see Melissa and Norman’s portrayal of it as it unfolded." ...|$|R

With Stahelski himself stating, [...] "All the way back to Kurosawa up to Sergio Leone. We like the spaghetti western sensibility there, some of the composition." [...] Albeit inspiration and emulation from the noir film genre, Stahelski too added that, [...] "Noir maybe was sort of less impactful for us than the other sort of westerns and Kurosawa and things like that.
