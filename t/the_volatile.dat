The infested plant by herbivores has been reacted to produce volatiles {{which is a}} cue used by the herbivore parasitoids for host location.

This research used a tritrophic interaction model of rice plant-brown plant hopper (BPH) -egg parasitoid of BPH. Research on analysis of chemical cues in tritrophic interactions was aimed to identify volatiles that are used by the parasitoid to find its host. <b>The</b> <b>volatiles</b> that effectively affect the parasitoid orientation behavior could be developed into a parasitoid attractant.

The initial steps {{are the same as}} above, and employs HDEHP for extraction chromatography, but coprecipitates the mendelevium with terbium fluoride instead of lanthanum fluoride. Then, 50mg of chromium is added to the mendelevium to reduce it to the +2 state in 0.1Mhydrochloric acid with zinc or mercury. The solvent extraction then proceeds, and while the trivalent and tetravalent lanthanides and actinides remain on the column, mendelevium(II) does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid.
