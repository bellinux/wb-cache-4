40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) strains resistant to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) may easily be selected for in vitro and in vivo under a suboptimal therapy regimen. Although cross-resistance is extensive within {{this class of}} compounds, newer NNRTIs were reported to retain activity against laboratory strains containing defined resistance-associated mutations. We have characterized HIV- 1 resistance to loviride {{and the extent of}} cross-resistance to nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, HBY- 097, and <b>tivirapine</b> in a set of 24 clinical samples from patients treated with long-term loviride monotherapy by using a recombinant virus assay. Genotypic changes associated with resistance were analyzed by population sequencing. Overall, phenotypic resistance to loviride ranged from 0. 04 to 3. 47 log 10 -fold. Resistance was observed in samples from patients who had discontinued loviride for up to 27 months. Cross-resistance to the other compounds was extensive; however, fold resistance to efavirenz was significantly lower than fold resistance to nevirapine. No genotypic changes were detected in three samples; these were sensitive to all of the NNRTIs tested. The most common genotypic change was the K 103 N substitution. The range of phenotypic resistance in samples containing the K 103 N substitution could not be predicted from a genotypic analysis of known NNRTI resistance-associated mutations. The Y 181 C substitution was detected in one isolate which was resistant to loviride and delavirdine but sensitive to efavirenz, HBY- 097, and <b>tivirapine.</b> Our data indicate that the available newer NNRTIs which retain activity against some HIV- 1 strains selected by other compounds of this class in vitro may have compromised clinical efficacy in some patients pretreated with NNRTI...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: After {{the initial}} {{discovery}} of 1 -(2 -hydroxyethoxymethyl) - 6 -(phenylthio) thymine (HEPT) and tetrahydroimidazo[4, 5, 1 -jk][1, 4]benzodiazepin- 2 (1 H) -one and thione (TIBO) derivatives, several other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NNRTI), including nevirapine (BI-RG- 587), pyridinone derivatives (L- 696, 229 and L- 697, 661), delavirdine (U- 90152), alpha-anilinophenylacetamides (alpha-APA) {{and various other}} classes of NNRTI have been described. The hallmark of NNRTI {{has been based on}} their ability to interact with a specific site ('pocket') of HIV- 1 RT. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether, in addition to HIV- 1, different strains of HIV- 2 (ROD and EHO) and SIV (mac 251, agm 3 and mndGB 1) are sensitive to a selection of NNRTI i. e. delavirdine, the HEPT derivative I-EBU (MKC- 442), 8 -chloro-TIBO (<b>tivirapine),</b> alpha-APA (loviride), nevirapine and the pyridinone derivative L- 697, 661. METHODS AND RESULTS: The NNRTI tested inhibited the replication of the different strains of HIV- 2 and SIV at micromolar concentrations. The inhibitory effects of the NNRTI on HIV- 2 -induced cytopathicity correlated well with their inhibitory effects on HIV- 2 RT activity. Drug-resistant HIV- 2 (EHO) variants containing the Ser 102 Leu and/or Glu 219 Asp mutations in their RT were selected after passaging the virus in MT- 4 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of delavirdine. The EHO virus mutants were at least 20 -fold less susceptible to the antiviral effects of delavirdine. Some cross-resistance, depending on the mutant strain, was observed with the other NNRTI tested (i. e. MKC- 442, <b>tivirapine,</b> loviride and pyridinone L- 697, 661). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that NNRTI are not exclusively specific for HIV- 1 but are also inhibitory to different HIV- 2 and SIV strains. These observations will have important implications for the development of new NNRTI with higher activity against both HIV- 1 and HIV- 2. Furthermore, in view of their anti-SIV activity, NNRTI could be evaluated further for their in vivo anti-retrovirus efficacy in non-human primate models. status: publishe...|$|E
