5000|$|This {{spaceship}} {{is founded}} on solidly conceived, yet unrealized science. One major concession was made in its appearance {{for the purpose of}} reducing confusion, and this was to eliminate the huge cooling [...] "wings" [...] which would be needed to radiate the heat produced by its hypothetical <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>propulsion</b> system. The producer and director Stanley Kubrick thought that the audiences might interpret the wings as meaning that the spacecraft was intended to fly through an atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|The author applies, {{develops}} and researches mini-sized Micro- AB Thermonuclear Reactors {{for space}} propulsion and space power systems. These small engines directly convert the high speed charged particles {{produced in the}} thermonuclear reactor into vehicle thrust or vehicle electricity with maximum efficiency. The simplest AB-thermonuclear propulsion offered allows spaceships to reach speeds of 20, 000 50, 000 km/s (1 / 6 of light speed) for fuel ratio 0. 1 and produces {{a huge amount of}} useful electric energy. Offered propulsion system permits flight to any planet of our Solar system in short time and to the nearest non-Sun stars by E-being or intellectual robots during a single human life period. Key words: AB-propulsion, <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>propulsion,</b> space propulsion, thermonuclear power system. Comment: 8 pages, 1 figur...|$|E
25|$|The Enzmann starship, as {{detailed}} by G. Harry Stine in the October 1973 issue of Analog, was a {{design for a}} future starship, based on the ideas of Robert Duncan-Enzmann. The spacecraft itself as proposed used a 12,000,000 ton ball of frozen deuterium to power 12â€“24 <b>thermonuclear</b> pulse <b>propulsion</b> units. Twice {{as long as the}} Empire State Building and assembled in-orbit, the spacecraft {{was part of a larger}} project preceded by interstellar probes and telescopic observation of target star systems.|$|R

40|$|Principles of operation, interplanetary orbit-to-orbit mission capabilities, {{technical}} problems, {{and environmental}} safeguards are examined for <b>thermonuclear</b> fusion <b>propulsion</b> systems. Two systems examined include (1) a fusion-electric concept in which kinetic energy of charged particles from the plasma is converted into electric power (for accelerating the propellant in an electrostatic thrustor) by the van de Graaf generator principle and (2) the direct fusion rocket in which energetic plasma lost from the reactor has a suitable amount of added propellant {{to obtain the}} optimum exhaust velocity. The deuterium-tritium and the deuterium/helium- 3 reactions are considered as suitable candidates, and attention is given to problems of cryogenic refrigeration systems, magnet shielding, and high-energy particle extraction and guidance...|$|R
40|$|The author {{offers several}} {{innovations}} that he first suggested publicly early in 1983 for the AB multi-reflex engine, space propulsion, getting energy from plasma, etc. (see: A. Bolonkin, Non-Rocket Space Launch and Flight, Elsevier, London, 2006, Chapters 12, 3 A). It is the micro-thermonuclear AB-Reactors. That is new micro-thermonuclear reactor with very small fuel pellet that uses plasma confinement generated by multi-reflection of laser beam or its own magnetic field. The Lawson criterion increases {{by hundreds of}} times. The author also suggests a new method of heating the power-making fuel pellet by outer electric current {{as well as new}} direct method of transformation of ion kinetic energy into harvestable electricity. These offered innovations dramatically decrease the size, weight and cost of <b>thermonuclear</b> reactor, installation, <b>propulsion</b> system and electric generator. Non-industrial countries can produce these researches and constructions. Currently, the author is researching the efficiency of these innovations for two types of the micro-thermonuclear reactors: multi-reflection reactor (ICF) and self-magnetic reactor (MCF).
