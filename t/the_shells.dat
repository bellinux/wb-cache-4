5|$|The {{failure of}} the {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> to detonate may have had various causes. As the submarines fired armour piercing shells, intended for use against steel ship hulls, the relatively softer brick walls may have failed to trigger the impact fuses. Sea water may have degraded <b>the</b> <b>shells,</b> which the Japanese had stored in deck lockers for several weeks. The age of <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> may also have been a factor; some of <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> recovered from the Newcastle bombardment were found to be of English manufacture; surplus munitions from World War I.|$|E
5|$|She {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire control under the director officer who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy since the ship's roll no longer dispersed <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> as each turret fired on its own; also, the fire-control director could more easily spot the fall of <b>the</b> <b>shells.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ghost in <b>the</b> <b>Shells</b> {{recording}} {{was done}} with a high-end studio to achieve superior sound throughout the film. A spatializer was used to alter the sound, specifically in the electronic brain conversations, to modify the voices.|$|E

5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs crack <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> {{with their}} pincers and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system {{to force the}} valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could manipulate <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E
5|$|The eggs {{would be}} divided into batches of 13, and placed under broody chickens. In {{the last week of}} the four-week {{incubation}} period the eggs would be sprinkled daily with warm water to soften <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> and allow the ducklings to hatch.|$|E
5|$|Dsungaripterids are {{traditionally}} {{thought of as}} being specialist molluscivores, using their powerful jaws to crush <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> of molluscs and crustaceans. While this remains the dominant view of dsungaripterid paleobiology today, {{some have suggested that}} they were generalistic omnivores eating a variety of hard foods, as dsungaripterids are better adapted to terrestrial movement rather than wading and are found in inland deposits.|$|E

5|$|In the spring, {{the adult}} females {{of this species}} lay eggs in {{tower-shaped}} structures. The eggs hatch as veliger larvae, which can float in the plankton for up to 14 weeks before settling onto the seabed as tiny snails. Crabs are a predator of this sea snail. After {{the death of the}} snails, if <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> are still intact they are often used by hermit crabs.|$|E
5|$|Iron Duke was {{the first}} British {{battleship}} to be mounted with anti-aircraft weaponry. In 1914, two 3in (7.62cm) QF guns were fitted to the aft superstructure, primarily to defend against German airships. The guns fired between 1214 rounds per minute, and were expected to fire approximately 1,250 shells before replacement or repair was necessary. <b>The</b> <b>shells</b> fired were 12.5lb (5.67kg) with a high-explosive warhead. They were manually operated, and had a maximum effective ceiling of 23,500ft (7,160m).|$|E
5|$|Lion {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised the pointing and firing {{of the guns}} {{under the command of}} the director positioned on the foremast. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers controlled by the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy as it was easier to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> as each turret fired individually.|$|E

5|$|Predators of Amphidromus snails {{include the}} red-crowned barbet Megalaima rafflesii, and {{probably}} other bird species.

5|$|The game's {{story and}} art design were written and {{illustrated}} by Masamune Shirow, the author of the original manga. Ghost in <b>the</b> <b>Shells</b> plot revolves around a recruit of Public Security Section 9 as he investigates and combats the Human Liberation Front. The player controls a Fuchikoma, a robotic fighting vehicle capable of traversing walls and ceilings.|$|E
5|$|The guns {{mounted in}} the open battery were lighter {{than those in the}} casemates and were not {{enclosed}} but traversed on rails in the open air. A covered section between each emplacement led to an ammunition lift shaft up which <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> and cartridges were raised using lifting gear that still survives.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>shell</b> of {{this species}} is {{inflated}} but still conical. <b>The</b> <b>shell</b> color is usually yellow to green. <b>The</b> <b>shell</b> has 2-4 whorls when eroded, and ~4.5 when intact. Each whorl is distinctly shouldered. The umbilicus is either not apparent, or very small.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>shells</b> {{are made}} of cast iron, {{as large as a}} bowl and shaped like a ball. Inside they contain half a pound of 'magic' gunpowder. They are sent flying towards the enemy camp from an eruptor; and when they get there a sound like a thunder-clap is heard, and flashes of light appear. If ten of these shells are fired {{successfully}} into the enemy camp, the whole place will be set ablaze...|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>shells</b> of Amphidromus are {{relatively}} large, {{from one to}} three inches high, and colorful. Amphidromus has an elongate-conic or ovate-conic helicoid shell of 5 to 8 whorls.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>shells</b> of {{the pumpkin}} bomb were {{manufactured}} by two Los Angeles firms, Consolidated Steel Corporation and Western Pipe and Steel Company, while the tail assembly {{was produced by}} Centerline Company of Detroit. After initial development, management {{of the program was}} turned over to the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ordnance in May 1945.

5|$|These guns fired 100lb (45.4kg) shells {{at a rate}} {{of between}} 57 per minute. <b>The</b> <b>shells</b> were fired with a muzzle {{velocity}} of 2,775fps (846mps), though the guns were capable of higher velocities. It was reduced in order to standardize the performance of all the 6inch guns in Royal Navy service, which would simplify range calculations for guns of the calibre. The guns could elevate to 20°, which enabled a maximum range of 15,800yd (14,450m).|$|E
5|$|A shell {{galaxy is}} a type of {{elliptical}} galaxy where the stars in the galaxy's halo are arranged in concentric shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two galaxy centers approach, the centers start to oscillate around a center point, the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming <b>the</b> <b>shells</b> of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923 has over twenty shells.|$|E
