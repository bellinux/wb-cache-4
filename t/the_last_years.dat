When Heraclius died, he devised the empire to both Heraclius Constantine and Heraklonas to rule jointly with Martina as Empress.|$|E

5|$|In 1925 he {{published}} a historical novel called L'Aube Rouge ("The Red Dawn") about <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> of the Kingdom of Imerina. In it he honored Rainandriamampandry, {{the governor of}} Toamasina who was executed by the French in 1896 for his suspected role in the Menalamba rebellion. Rabearivelo published his second and third poetry anthologies, Sylves ("Woodlands") and Volumes, in 1927 and 1928 respectively. He also published his second historical novel in 1928, L'interférence ("Interference"), which depicts {{the life of a}} noble family from <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> of the monarchy until colonization. Throughout the 1920s, he translated the works of foreign poets and writers into Malagasy, including Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Laforgue, Rilke, Whitman, and Góngora; he also translated traditional Malagasy kabary (oratory) into French for publication in French-language literary reviews.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, {{the noted}} Scottish filmmaker and theatre {{director}} Bill Bryden made the Channel 4-funded film Ill Fares The Land about <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> of St Kilda. It is not currently on commercial release.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Merrick, the Elephant Man, {{moved to}} Whitechapel Road in 1884. Visitors paid {{to see him}} in the back room of a shop owned by showman Tom Norman.

Merrick later moved to the hospital permanently, where he spent <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> of his life.|$|E

40|$|Few {{studies have}} focused on the care setting {{transitions}} that occur in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life. People living in rural areas may have more difficult care setting transitions and also more moves in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life as health changes occur. A mixed-methods study was conducted to gain an understanding of the number and implications or impact of care setting transitions in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life for rural Canadians. Rural Albertans had significantly more healthcare setting transitions than urbanites in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life (M= 4. 2 vs 3. 3). Online family respondents reported 8 moves on average occurred in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life. These moves were most often identified (65 %) on a likert-type scale as “very difficult,” with the free text information revealing these trips were often emotionally painful for themselves and physically painful for the decedent. Eleven informants were then interviewed until data saturation, with constant-comparative data analysis conducted. Moving from place to place for needed care in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life was identified as common and concerning for rural people and their families, with three data themes developing: (a) needed care in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life is scattered across many places, (b) traveling is very difficult for terminally-ill persons and their caregivers, and (c) local rural services are minimal. These findings indicate planning is needed to avoid unnecessary end-of-life care setting transitions and to make needed moves for essential services in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life less costly, stressful, and socially disruptive for rural people and their families. </p...|$|R
5|$|Ladislaus spent <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> of {{his life}} {{wandering}} from place to place. Hungary's central government lost power because the prelates and the barons ruled the kingdom independently of the monarch. For example, Ivan Kőszegi and his brothers waged wars against Albert I, Duke of Austria, but Ladislaus did not intervene, although the Austrians captured at least 30 fortresses along the western borders.|$|E
5|$|The film also rescues {{a central}} concept in the comics, {{the fact that}} {{radiation}} {{is one of the}} causes of genetic mutation in the X-Men fictional universe, and incorporates it in the storyline, resurrecting the concept which went unused in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years,</b> as writers in the comics more recently have attributed the phenomenon of mutation mostly to evolution and natural selection.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> of Chelvanayakam were {{personally}} difficult.

5|$|After {{a series}} of civil wars, Ladislaus's main focus was the {{restoration}} of public safety. He introduced severe legislation, punishing those who violated property rights with death or mutilation. He occupied almost all Croatia in 1091, which {{marked the beginning of}} an expansion period for the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Ladislaus's victories over the Pechenegs and Cumans ensured the security of his kingdom's eastern borders for about 150 years. His relationship with the Holy See deteriorated during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> of his reign, as the popes claimed that Croatia was their fief, but Ladislaus denied their claims.|$|E
5|$|After the crisis, Unicamp saw {{a period}} of renewal and restructuring. In 1983 the bylaws were rewritten, {{ensuring}} {{the autonomy of the}} academic community, and the new management structure for the campus was implemented. In 1986 the newly created University Council replaces the previous Directive Council as the supreme body of the university. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> of the 1980s saw a reformulation of the admissions exam, expansion of the laboratories and the completion of the first units of the student housing.|$|E

5|$|After the one {{surviving}} roll from Henry I's reign, {{no further}} Pipe rolls survived from his reign, nor are any preserved from {{the reign of}} his successor, King Stephen (reigned 1135–1154). But by {{the second year of}} King Henry II's reign, or 1155, they once more survive. It is unclear if Pipe rolls were actually created during Stephen's reign and they did not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation of Pipe rolls. Continuously from the early years of King Henry II's reign, most Pipe rolls survive, with only a break in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> of King John's reign (reigned 1199–1216).|$|E

Following his return, he became an active supporter of the Libyan resistance to Italian rule, raising funds and fighters to aid the Libyans and penning an anthem for them. He would later lead his own group of rebels in alliance with Ibrahim Hananu to fight against French Mandatory forces in northern Syria in 1919–20.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the early}} Meiji era {{witnessed}} a warming between the imperial court and foreign powers, relations with France temporarily soured {{due to the}} initial support by France for the Shogun. Soon however a second military mission was invited to Japan in 1874, and a third one in 1884. A high level of interaction resumed around 1886, when France helped build the Imperial Japanese Navy's first large-scale modern fleet, {{under the direction of}} naval engineer Louis-Émile Bertin. The modernization of the country had started during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> of the Shogunate, and the Meiji government ultimately adopted the same policy.|$|E

5|$|Born in 1541, {{in either}} the village of Fodele or Candia (the Venetian name of Chandax, present day Heraklion) on Crete, El Greco was descended from a prosperous urban family, which had {{probably}} been driven out of Chania to Candia after an uprising against the Catholic Venetians between 1526 and 1528. El Greco's father, Geórgios Theotokópoulos (d. 1556), was a merchant and tax collector. Nothing is known about his mother or his first wife, also Greek. El Greco's older brother, Manoússos Theotokópoulos (1531– 13 December 1604), was a wealthy merchant and spent <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> of his life (1603–1604) in El Greco's Toledo home.|$|E
