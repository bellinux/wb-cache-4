De Peyster's father paid ten-dollar bounties to the men who signed the muster roll of his company.

5|$|Either way, {{many of the}} {{countries}} involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates, and capital controls are not available. The only solution left <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> country's level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would reduce its trade deficit. It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.|$|E
5|$|Further {{construction}} of the line was limited {{by a lack of}} funds. Russell asked the LNWR to adopt the line in August 1865, to no avail. An Act of 1866 gave permission <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>a</b> further £20,000, with loans of £6,600. After raising this capital, the line was opened to Llanerchymedd in 1866, with the temporary station at Llangefni replaced by a permanent structure half a mile further on. Captain Rich, when surveying the line, noted that the curves and gradients were severe, and recommended that the line be worked at moderate speed. He also noted the lack of turntables, and the company's intention to use Fairlie engines on the line.|$|E
