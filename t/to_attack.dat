5|$|A last {{option was}} <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> fighter factories, {{which was not}} {{attempted}} on 18 August.

Still, {{the attacks on the}} southern factories would require large concentrations of bombers and fighters which would be powerful enough to destroy them without sustaining heavy losses.|$|E

5|$|During the night, Washington {{called a}} council {{of war and}} asked his {{officers}} whether they should stand and fight, attempt to cross the river somewhere, or take the backroads <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> Princeton. Although the idea had already occurred to Washington, he learned from Arthur St. Clair and John Cadwalader that his plan <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> Princeton was indeed possible. Two intelligence collection efforts, both of which came to fruition {{at the end of}} December 1776, supported such a surprise attack. After consulting with his officers, they agreed that the best option was <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> Princeton.|$|E

5|$|North Korean {{planners}} {{intended for}} three divisions <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> Taejon from three directions, supported by tanks. The North Korean 3rd Division was ordered <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> from the north, against the flank. The North Korean 4th Division would attack across the Kum River {{from the east}} and south, in order to envelop Taejon and the US 24th Infantry Division with it. Eventually they would also be supported by elements of the North Korean 105th Armored Division. Although the North Korean 2nd Infantry Division was ordered <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> from Chongju against the American right flank, it was slow to move and arrived too late {{to participate in the}} battle.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 July, the 10th Guards Mechanized and 24th Guards Tank Brigades, in {{cooperation}} with the 95th and 52nd Guards Rifle Corps, launched attacks against Totenkopf. These Soviet attacks preoccupied Totenkopf and prevented it from attacking toward Prokhorovka. Around noon, Leibstandartes 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion was ordered <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> northward toward the Psel River to consolidate its front line with Totenkopf, while the division's panzer units were <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> toward Soviet positions northeast of the Oktyabrsky State Farm toward Prokhorovka.|$|E
5|$|The Dallachy Wing was {{on alert}} <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> any ships {{found by the}} {{reconnaissance}} patrol. Although the group of five merchant ships were highly vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> and a worthwhile target, Coastal Command came under the operational command of the Admiralty and was bound by its decision to give higher priority to attacking warships than merchant vessels. As a result, the wing was dispatched against Z33 even though the destroyer and its escorts were well protected and {{in a difficult position}} for aircraft <b>to</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E
5|$|The second {{theory is}} simply that the battle {{occurred}} because the Persians finally moved <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> the Athenians. Although this theory has the Persians moving to the strategic offensive, this can be reconciled with the traditional account of the Athenians attacking the Persians by assuming that, seeing the Persians advancing, the Athenians took the tactical offensive, and attacked them. Obviously, it cannot be firmly established which theory (if either) is correct. However, both theories imply {{that there was some}} kind of Persian activity which occurred on or about the fifth day which ultimately triggered the battle. It is also possible that both theories are correct: when the Persians sent the cavalry by ship <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> Athens, they simultaneously sent their infantry <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> at Marathon, triggering the Greek counterattack.|$|E

5|$|A fictionalized memoir set in {{both the}} United States and France during the 1960s American civil rights movement, White Dog focuses on the events that occur after Gary and his then-wife Jean Seberg, an actress and an activist, adopt a {{handsome}} and clearly well-trained German Shepherd dog who comes back to their home with one of their other dogs. At first, the dog, which they name Batka, is an ideal new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment of other animals. To their dismay, they discover that the dog, a former Alabama police dog, was trained <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> black people on sight. Although they are told the dog is {{too old to be}} retrained, they take him to a black dog trainer to try. Instead, the man trains the dog <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> white people, including Gary himself. Gary states that he changed the ending of the American version to be more optimistic.|$|E
5|$|A {{problem with}} early bombsights {{was that they}} could only correct {{for the effects of}} the wind in a simple way and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to minimise the complexity of the required calculations. This made it difficult <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E
5|$|According to Oan Ali Mohammed, {{suppression}} of the Arab sovereignty movement was the spark {{that led to his}} desire <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> the Iranian Embassy in London.

5|$|After {{defeating}} the Hessians at the Battle of Trenton {{on the morning}} of December 26, 1776, Washington withdrew back to Pennsylvania. He subsequently decided <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> the British forces before going into winter quarters. On December 29, he led his army back into Trenton. On the night of January 2, 1777, Washington repulsed a British attack at the Battle of the Assunpink Creek. That night, he evacuated his position, circled around General Lord Cornwallis' army, and went <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> the British garrison at Princeton.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Persano was {{replaced}} by Admiral Giovanni Vacca; he was ordered <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> the main Austrian naval base at Pola, but the war ended before the operation could be carried out. After {{the end of the}} war, the government lost confidence in the fleet and drastically reduced the naval budget. The cuts were so severe that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron <b>to</b> <b>attack</b> the port of Civitavecchia in September 1870, as part of the wars of Italian unification. Instead, the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home. Terribile was rapidly surpassed, first by central battery and then turret ships, which made the first generation of ironclads like Terribile and her sister obsolete.|$|E
