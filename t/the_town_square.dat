5|$|Spanish {{forces were}} entrenched {{on the crest}} of two small hills, between which the road from Arroyo to Guayama ran. The Americans had crossed a stream in front of the hills when {{suddenly}} the Spanish opened fire. The Americans protected their position by the stream and increased their firepower as more reinforcements arrived. The outnumbered Spanish troops retreated to Guayama as the Americans made their advance on the hills. The firefight, which lasted half an hour, left three American wounded. When the 4th Ohio entered the town they discovered that the Spaniards had fled north and abandoned the city, ending the Battle of Guayama. General John Rutter Brooke used the Cautiño Residence (Casa Cautiño) by <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>square</b> in Guayama as his military headquarters.|$|E
5|$|The first {{identification}} of Plymouth Rock as the actual landing site was in 1741 by 90-year-old Thomas Faunce, whose father {{had arrived in}} Plymouth in 1623, {{three years after the}} supposed event. The rock was later covered by a solid-fill pier. In 1774, an attempt was made to excavate the rock, but it broke in two. The severed piece was placed in <b>the</b> <b>Town</b> <b>Square</b> at the center of Plymouth. In 1880, the intact half of the rock was excavated from the pier, and the broken piece was reattached to it. Over the years, souvenir hunters have removed chunks from the rock, but the remains are now protected as part of the complex of living museums. These include the Mayflower II, a recreation of the original ship; Plimoth Plantation, a historical recreation of the original 1620 settlement; and the Wampanoag Homesite, which recreates a 17th-century Indian village.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the film}} {{takes place in}} Blackeberg, a suburb of Stockholm, {{principal}} photography took place in Luleå (in the north of Sweden) to ensure enough snow and cold weather. The area where the filming took place dated from {{around the same time}} as Blackeberg, and has similar architecture. However, Alfredson shot a few scenes in the Blackeberg area. In particular, the scene where Eli leaps down on Virginia from a tree, was shot in <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>square</b> of Blackeberg. Another scene, where Eli attacks Jocke in an underpass, was shot in the nearby suburb of Råcksta. The original Blackeberg underpass that Lindqvist had envisioned was deemed too high to fit in the picture. Some of the outdoor close-up scenes were made in a super cold studio. The jungle gym where much of the interaction between Oskar and Eli takes place was constructed specifically for the film. Its design was intended to suit the CinemaScope format better than a regular jungle gym, which would typically have to be cropped height-wise.|$|E

5|$|Forensic entomology: The Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{forensic}} science book Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified published by court judge, physician, medical scientist and writer Song Ci in 1247 contains the oldest known case of forensic entomology. In {{a murder case}} of 1235, a villager was stabbed to death and authorities determined that his wounds were inflicted by a sickle; this was a tool used for cutting rice at harvest time, a fact which led them to suspect a fellow peasant worker was involved. The local magistrate had the villagers assemble in <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>square</b> where they would temporarily relinquish their sickles. Within minutes, a mass of blow flies gathered around one sickle and none other, attracted to the scent of traces of blood unseen by the naked eye. It became apparent to all that the owner of that sickle was the culprit, the latter pleading for mercy as he was detained by authorities.|$|E

B Company was placed in reserve and the battalion anti-tank guns were distributed along the front line. At <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>square</b> an ambush was laid by the 4th CLY.

5|$|Kirill {{arrives at}} the {{workshop}} of Theophanes the Greek (Nikolai Sergeyev), a prominent and well-recognized master painter, {{who is working on}} a new icon of Jesus Christ. Theophanes is portrayed as a complex character: an established artist, humanistic and God-fearing in his views yet somewhat cynical, regarding his art more as a craft and a chore in his disillusion with other people. His young apprentices have all run away to <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>square,</b> where a wrongly convicted criminal is about to be tortured and executed. Kirill talks to Theophanes, and the artist, impressed by the monk's understanding and erudition, invites him to work as his apprentice on the decoration of the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow. Kirill refuses at first, but then accepts the offer on the condition that Theophanes will personally come to the Andronikov Monastery and invite Kirill to work with him in front of all the fraternity and Andrei Rublev, who according to Theophanes' comments has some fame as an icon painter in the outside world.|$|E

5|$|Revolt {{began to}} stir in St Albans in Hertfordshire late on 13 June, when news broke {{of the events}} in London. There had been long-running {{disagreements}} in St Albans between {{the town and the}} local abbey, which had extensive privileges in the region. On 14 June, protesters met with the Abbot, Thomas de la Mare, and demanded their freedom from the abbey. A group of townsmen under the leadership of William Grindecobbe traveled to London, where they appealed to the King for the rights of the abbey to be abolished. Wat Tyler, then still in control of the city, granted them authority in the meantime to take direct action against the abbey. Grindecobbe and the rebels returned to St Albans, where they found the Prior had already fled. The rebels broke open the abbey gaol, destroyed the fences marking out the abbey lands and burnt the abbey records in <b>the</b> <b>town</b> <b>square.</b> They then forced Thomas de la Mare to surrender the abbey's rights in a charter on 16 June. The revolt against the abbey spread out over the next few days, with abbey property and financial records being destroyed across the county.|$|E
