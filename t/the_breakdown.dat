5|$|Amartya Sen’s {{cooperative}} conflicts {{approach to}} gender biases frames women’s gender disadvantage through three different responses: breakdown wellbeing, perceived interest and perceived contribution responses. <b>The</b> <b>breakdown</b> well-being response—derived from the Nash equilibrium—describes breakdown positions between individuals during cooperative decisions. When <b>the</b> <b>breakdown</b> position of one individual {{is less than}} the other person, the solution to any conflict will ultimately result in less favourable conditions for the first individual. In terms of women’s health in India, the overall gender disadvantage facing women—represented by cultural and societal factors that favour men over women—negatively impacts their ability to make decisions with regards to seeking out healthcare.|$|E

40|$|This work {{reports the}} effects of drain impact {{ionization}} injection on <b>the</b> gate dielectric <b>breakdown.</b> Results show that due to the high energy hot carrier injection, the gate oxide can break drown twice ai a low oxide electric field (< 1. 2 MV/cm). <b>The</b> first <b>breakdown</b> occurs simultaneously with <b>the</b> drain avalanche <b>breakdown</b> whereas <b>the</b> second <b>breakdown</b> occurs beyond <b>the</b> drain <b>breakdown.</b> It is further identified that the first gate oxide breakdown is governed by the thermionic emission of hot electrons at low oxide fields (< 1. 0 MV/cm) and by the scattering processes at higher oxide fields. <b>The</b> second <b>breakdown</b> is attributed to the Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) tunneling.

5|$|A {{pastiche}} {{of following}} scenes alternates between Spears {{dancing on the}} soundstage, singing with the microphones and a scene of just red lips, {{a reference to the}} opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This begins to show her losing grip, reminiscent of her break down. When <b>the</b> <b>breakdown</b> starts, she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers, staining the room and the monitors, symbolizing her own fall as her name becomes tainted. Then, two versions of Spears, both wearing blue and red dresses with flowing trains, are seen fighting each other, another symbolism, this time of her fighting her inner demons. After this, both versions of Spears, as well as her on the wedding dress, fall exhausted to the ground, symbolizing the lowest point of her life during <b>the</b> <b>breakdown.</b> While interspersed scenes of Spears in the soundstage are shown, the other versions of herself start to wake up, showing her getting her feet back on the ground and making a comeback, refusing to give up. The final scene shows Spears dressed in a short black dress with her dancers in black on a stage, with confetti and pyrotechnics around them. In the final shot a question mark (?) appears in multicolored letters. This final scene shows her as she once was, a superstar who is back to reclaim her title. The video ends with the same multicolored lettering of a question mark, symbolizing the unknown that is to come.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{comparative}} study on off-state breakdown characteristics in nanowire JL and IM multiple gate MOSFETs has been performed for different gate bias voltages and fin widths. In {{order to understand}} <b>the</b> drain <b>breakdown</b> mechanism with different transistor structures, the device was simulated using the 3 -dimensional ATLAS software. The band-to-band tunneling current and the gate-induced-drain-leakage current trigger <b>the</b> off-state <b>breakdown</b> in JL transistor and IM transistor, respectively. From experiment and simulation, <b>the</b> off-state <b>breakdown</b> voltage is lower in JL transistor than in IM transistor.
