5000|$|Childlike Life of the <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> By the <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> (1973) ...|$|R
5000|$|After <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> {{takes care}} of the gang, he kills Loco by choking him with the money he was paid for killing the woman. Daredevil shows up at the scene, asking what <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> has done; <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> then tells him that he plans on taking {{the rest of the money}} from the hideout. Daredevil {{attempts}} to stop him but is knocked out with a single punch from <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula.</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> collects the money and gets ready to leave, but before he goes he kneels in front of Daredevil and heals the flu he has been afflicted with. <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> leaves the money he took from the gang in a church, with a note saying [...] "Help people with this".|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} the <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> is {{shrouded}} in mystery and misinformation. There is a legend that the <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> was a European explorer, who traveled to Japan several centuries ago and was trained by the ninja-clan the Hand. At {{the end of the}} training he was awarded with a special potion that gave him superhuman powers and immortality. In reality, the <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula's</b> immortality has a more earthly origin: the title is inherited from father to son, all posing as the same person (reminiscent of the Phantom). Though not truly immortal, the <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> possesses a multitude of superhuman powers {{as a result of the}} potion his ancestor drank.|$|R
50|$|Spider-Man {{takes on}} the {{identity}} of Ricochet during the Identity Crisis storyline, (faced with accusations of murder and assault, Peter abandoned the Spider-Man identity and donned four new costumes to continue his heroics while trying to clear his name), to infiltrate The Rose's organization and {{find out more about}} <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula,</b> fighting Bloodscream and Roughouse with his former enemy Delilah (although was in fact the <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula's</b> ex-wife, who had fled the country with their son, disliking the changes that Carlos underwent when he took on the mantle of the <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> and did not want the same fate for her son. Furthermore, Marina had a friend, who was Don Fortunato's cousin. They ask Don Fortunato for protection and the <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> attacked Don Fortunato's mansion. Inside the mansion, <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> defeats Fortunato's guards including Spider-Man again, but loses his wife when she confronts him and points out that he is scaring his own son. She reminds him what a burden the <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> title had been on him and Carlos relented. He leaves, but tells her that he would one day come back to take his son.|$|R
50|$|The current <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> {{moves his}} base of {{operations}} from Argentina to New York, claiming {{that he wants to}} expand his operation. He comes into conflict with the local crime lord The Rose (Jacob Conover), and defeats the Rose's enforcer, Delilah, though he heals her severe injuries afterwards. The <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> hires Roughouse and Bloodscream to do his dirty work and drives back The Rose, establishing control over a large part of New York City. When The Rose goes to Don Fortunato, a powerful crime lord ruling over New York City, for help, the <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> appears in person and offers Fortunato an alliance. Fortunato accepts, but the <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> has to prove his loyalty by defeating Spider-Man and bringing back his mask. <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> did as he was asked and defeated Spider-Man — not even bothering to see who Spider-Man was under the mask —, but lets him live when he learns that Spider-Man was trying to rescue a small child.|$|R
50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> and White Tiger {{are then}} given the {{assignment}} to kill Foggy Nelson by Lady Bullseye, {{who has been}} hired by The Owl. <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> instead saves Foggy's life and then battles White Tiger, attempting to cure her of the Hand's influence.|$|R

Carlos goes to Matt Murdock for a job; Matt has him work with Dakota North, an investigator working for Nelson & Murdock. Carlos, who is dissatisfied with the job, longs for a more hands on approach to stop crime. Matt notices and takes Carlos with him to battle a Yakuza gang working in Hell's Kitchen. The leader of the Yakuza gang flees from the attack; Daredevil chases him but fails to catch him because he has flu, which is retarding his abilities. <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> and Daredevil survey the scene and notice a large pile of money. <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> says {{that he would like to}} take the money but Daredevil stops him. Later, <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> takes on a gang whose leader was hired to kill an old woman. This leader is a vengeful former recruit of <b>Black</b> <b>Tarantula</b> who, years before, Carlos had personally invited into his gang, naming him [...] "Little Loco".|$|R
