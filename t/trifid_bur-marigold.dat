50|$|The most {{interesting}} feature ecologically is {{a chain of}} old ponds. Starting from the east, they are Burnham's Pond, Warren Pond, Long Pond, Ellern Mede Pond and Pink Cottage Pond. They vary in character, but all have interesting wetland flora, and most are valuable for dragonflies, other invertebrates and amphibians. Plants to be found {{around the edges of}} the ponds include lesser spearwort, <b>trifid</b> <b>bur-marigold</b> and fool's watercress (Apium nodiflorum). In deeper water, white water-lily and curled and broad-leaved pondweeds can be found. Long Pond is used for angling.|$|E
50|$|The loch is botanically-rich loch and Martnaham Wood {{is one of}} {{the largest}} oak woods in Ayrshire; {{although}} it was clear felled in 1914, it has regenerated with little disturbance. The loch exhibits vegetation of submerged, floating and emergent type plant communities. The margin has extensive areas of reed-swamp dominated by common reed. Branched bur-reed, water-plantain, nodding bur-marigold, <b>trifid</b> <b>bur-marigold,</b> greater spearwort, and eight-stamened waterwort are found at the site. In the deeper water white and yellow water-lilies dominate. Canadian pondweed is an invasive plant and is here in abundance. The loch is classed as mesotrophic (moderately nutrient-rich), however it has eutrophic characteristics.|$|E
50|$|A notable {{feature of}} Lough Derravaragh, as found at Lough Lene, are {{the range of}} {{stoneworts}} that occur within the lake. Eight species have been recorded here, several of which have a restricted range in Ireland. Fringing the lake's shores, a range of habitats has been created {{as a result of}} drainage of the River Inny. At the western side are extensive reed beds and swamps of downy birch and willows. Nearby, there is also freshwater marches vegetation dominated by sedges (Carex spp.) and often tussock-forming grasses such as tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa) and fescues (Festuca spp.), with a flowering herbs including Bidens cernua, and <b>trifid</b> <b>bur-marigold.</b>|$|E
