5|$|The rest of {{this edition}} I have not read, but, from the little that I have seen, I think it not {{dangerous}} to declare <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion, its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare.|$|E
25|$|Adopted {{during the}} reign of the Stewart dynasty, and {{certainly}} in use by the reign of James IV (1488–1513), Appearing beneath the shield may have led to the conclusion that Nemo me impune lacessit is the motto of the Royal arms, whereas historical evidence coupled with the conventions of heraldry in Scotland would suggest <b>that</b> <b>In</b> <b>my</b> defens God me defend is the motto of the Royal arms and therefore the motto of Scotland itself.|$|E
25|$|At 7 in {{the evening}} of November 28 {{occurred}} a new paroxysm, during which the volcano vomited forth such masses of fire and ejecta <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion, all the material ejected during so many months, if taken together, would not equal the quantity which issued at the time. The columns of fire and smoke ascended higher than ever before, increasing every moment in volume, and setting fire to the whole island, there being not the smallest portion of the latter which was {{not covered by the}} smoke and the glowing rocks and ashes. All this was accompanied by terrific lightning and thunder above, and violent shocks of earthquakes underneath. The cloud of ejecta, carried on by the wind, extended itself toward west and south with the result that we saw already some stones fall close to our shore. I, therefore, shouted to all those who were still in the town to take to flight and we all ran off in a hurry; otherwise we would have been engulfed on the spot; as the waves of the angry lake began already to flood the houses nearest to the beach.|$|E

25|$|Now {{differences}} between the contemporary squid and octopus samples became very clear. In the octopus, broad bands of fibers passed across {{the plane of the}} tissue and were separated by equally broad bands arranged in a perpendicular direction. In the squid there were narrower but also relatively broad bundles arranged in the plane of the section, separated by thin partitions of perpendicular fibers. It seemed I had found a means to identify the mystery sample after all. I could distinguish between octopus and squid, and between them and mammals, which display a lacy network of connective tissue fibers. After 75 years, the moment of truth was at hand. Viewing section after section of the St. Augustine samples, we decided at once, and beyond any doubt, that the sample was not whale blubber. Further, the connective tissue pattern was that of broad bands in the plane of the section with equally broad bands arranged perpendicularly, a structure similar to, if not identical with, <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> octopus sample. The evidence appears unmistakable that the St. Augustine sea monster was in fact an octopus, but the implications are fantastic. Even though the sea presents us from time to time with strange and astonishing phenomena, the idea of a gigantic octopus, with arms 75 to 100 feet in length and about 18 inches in diameter at the base—a total spread of some 200 feet—is difficult to comprehend.|$|E

Boit later explained, [...] "It {{was a bit}} challenging at first because I had never experienced cold weather like <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, even putting on skis was so difficult! But after some time, I learned to adapt." [...] The response to Nike's project was mixed, with some comparing the story {{to the story of}} the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Games, while others such as Bob Wojnowski of The Detroit News said [...] "These are marketing pawns financed by well-heeled publicity seekers." ...|$|E

[...] When asked about his own presidential aspirations, he responded by saying that [...] "There are many great people in our party <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion, are much more qualified [...] than I am.

500|$|On March 6, 2007, Sports Illustrated {{reported}} that Angle's name {{was found in}} the client database of a Florida wellness center suspected of being a front for distributing performance enhancing drugs. The magazine alleged that Angle had received prescriptions for trenbolone (which is not approved for human use by the FDA) and nandrolone, both anabolic steroids. Angle responded on his official website: [...] "I did not improperly receive prescriptions. It is well documented <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> career I have broken vertebrae in my neck on five occasions and each time the course of treatment was under the care and supervision of my doctors. Any attempt to link me to the athletes in the current news accounts who may have improperly sought performance-enhancing drugs is without foundation".|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), Tarun Mansukhani conceived a film about three friends who share an apartment. After {{the production}} wrapped, Karan Johar told him that Mansukhani was ready to direct a film and should write a script; if Johar liked it, he would produce the film. He set the film in Miami, since he liked its lifestyle and culture: [...] "People in Miami work hard and party harder and I wanted to capture <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> film." [...] Mansukhani worked for eight months on the script; Johar liked it, and {{asked him about the}} cast. In an interview, Manuskhani described Dostana as a story of [...] "how the three strangers come together, live together in an apartment and have their moments of happiness and sorrow." ...|$|E

500|$|Akhtar {{revealed}} that the reason behind the remake was a desire to give a new treatment to [...] "a fantastic film which he enjoyed watching as a child", and create an adaptation that he thought would suit modern times. He found the film little ahead of its time. And, he thought so because of the narration, dialogue and the writing style, which he thought was very modern even for its time. Akhtar said [...] "Don is the one film from that time <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind lends itself to being remade today. So today, when you adapt it, it fits very easily into a contemporary space. I think it fits into the modern sensibility of movie viewing." [...] Additionally, he wanted {{to pay tribute to}} the stars and makers of the original film, the 1970s era in general, and the films made by Salim-Javed and Amitabh Bachchan.|$|E
500|$|Evidence of the {{overlapping}} subject matter between the shows, {{as well as}} the conflict between them, arose when Aaron Sorkin, the creator of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, asked Lorne Michaels to allow him to observe Saturday Night Live for a week, a request Michaels denied. Despite this, Sorkin sent Fey flowers after NBC announced it would pick up both series, and wished her luck with 30 Rock. Fey said, [...] "it's just bad luck for me <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> first attempt at prime time I'm going up against the most powerful writer on television. I was joking that this would be the best pilot ever aired on Trio. And then Trio got canceled." [...] Fey wound up [...] "beating" [...] Sorkin when Studio 60 was canceled after one season and 30 Rock was renewed for a second. Though 30 Rocks first-season ratings proved lackluster and were lower than those of Studio 60, Studio 60 was more expensive to produce.|$|E
500|$|In late 1969, after George Harrison's song [...] "Something" [...] {{had been}} issued on the A-side {{of a single}} by the Beatles – {{the first time that}} one of his {{compositions}} had been given that honour – he remarked in an interview: [...] "There's a lot of songs like <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head. I must get them down. Maybe even other people would like to sing them." [...] In the summer of 1970, [...] "Something" [...] gave Welsh singer Shirley Bassey her biggest UK hit in nine years, an achievement that led her to tell the press that she and Harrison could become a singer-and-songwriter pairing on the scale of Dionne Warwick and Burt Bacharach. Although he would later be dismissive of Bassey's version of [...] "Something", Harrison wrote a new song for her to record after reading these comments. Originally titled [...] "Whenever", it became [...] "When Every Song Is Sung" [...] and later [...] "I'll Still Love You".|$|E

He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father. An engram, or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from." ...|$|E
500|$|As Flag Captain to Admiral Collard, Dewar was {{technically}} Collard's chief {{staff officer}} {{as well as}} captain of the Royal Oak. [...] A good working relationship between Dewar and the second-in-command of the battle squadron was necessary. [...] Notwithstanding, Collard on occasion acted imperiously and tactlessly on his flagship, causing friction with Dewar and his executive officer, Commander Henry Martin Daniel, DSO. [...] At a dance on the quarterdeck on 12 January 1928, Collard openly lambasted Royal Marine Bandmaster, Percy Barnacle, and allegedly said [...] "I won't have a bugger like <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> ship" [...] {{in the presence of}} ship's officers and guests. [...] Dewar and Daniel accused Collard of [...] "vindictive fault-finding" [...] and openly humiliating and insulting them before their crew, referring to an incident involving Collard's disembarkation from the ship on 5 March where the admiral had openly said that he was [...] "fed up with the ship"; Collard countercharged the two with failing to follow orders and treating him [...] "worse than a midshipman".|$|E
500|$|Krabs values money {{more than}} his own {{well-being}} and assesses the other characters based on their financial value to him. The only exceptions are Pearl and his girlfriend Mrs. Puff. His love for Mrs. Puff {{is so strong that}} it temporarily transcends his greed and drives him to buy her expensive gifts. Krabs tolerates his two employees because they work for little pay and because of their positive impact on his finances, but he is quick to rebuke them if they engage in behavior that drives away customers. Krabs has a tentative father-son relationship with SpongeBob; Krabs often scolds him if he gets in trouble, but at times gives him fatherlike advice. Former showrunner Paul Tibbitt has stated that this Krabs-SpongeBob dynamic is his favorite part of the show, telling Digital Spy in 2011 that [...] "the aspect of SpongeBob I love the most is his undying loyalty to Mr. Krabs. No matter how Mr. Krabs treats him. I try to replicate <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own life in every way." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 28, 2012, Jessica Sanchez, a {{contestant}} of {{the eleventh}} season of American Idol, covered [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] performing a slow-tempo ballad {{version of the}} song accompanied at the beginning by harps. Her performance received favorable comments and a standing ovation from the judges of the show. Jennifer Lopez commented, [...] "You did a beautiful job on it...If I was Beyoncé and I was home and I heard that, I'd be like 'I got to do <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> next concert, slow that one down.'" [...] Steven Tyler described Sanchez's performance as [...] "great" [...] while Randy Jackson noted that it was [...] "unbelievable, sensational". James Montgomery of MTV News graded her performance with a B, and called the cover [...] "a bit of an odd choice, and yet also a supremely confident one". He added, [...] "For once, she pulled things back, and maybe suffered a bit for doing so, but there were still plenty of subtly great moments, particularly in the verses.

500|$|In September 2005, Žigić {{signed a}} one-year {{extension}} to his contract, {{which had been}} due to expire {{at the end of}} the season. He helped his team progress through the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Cup, and according to Reuters' correspondent, [...] "capped a brilliant individual performance with two goals" [...] as well as providing the cross for Milan Purović as Red Star beat Roma 3–1 in the third match of the group stage. His first goal, a header, appeared to have been scored from an offside position, but for the second, in the 86th minute, he dispossessed Philippe Mexès, evaded two more opponents, and bent the ball into the top corner from [...] with his weaker left foot. He said afterwards, [...] "I've never scored a goal like <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> entire career. I was going to pass the ball but there was no one ahead of me so I just decided to go for it and see what happens". The win left Red Star needing to win their last group match to stand a chance of qualifying for the knockout rounds, but they failed to do so.|$|E

Though Mori possesses a strength and fury that should serve well against the Kaiju, Pentecost is reluctant to use her, partly because of a fatherly bond and partly because he knows she is still fighting the terror of her childhood. Del Toro stated: [...] "I was very careful how I built the movie. One {{of the other things}} I decided was that I wanted a female lead who has the equal force as the male leads. She's {{not going to be a}} sex kitten, she's not going to come out in cutoff shorts and a tank top, and it's going to be a real earnestly drawn character." [...] Noting that the other actors were exhausted and [...] "destroyed physically" [...] by filming in the intensive Jaeger cockpit harnesses, del Toro said: [...] "The only one that didn't break was Rinko Kikuchi, the girl. She never complained… I asked Rinko her secret and she said 'I think of gummi bears and flowers.' I try to do <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life now." [...] Mana Ashida plays Mako as a child.|$|E
