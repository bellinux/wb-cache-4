5|$|Angel {{finds that}} he cannot {{stop talking about}} his divorce when trying <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>new</b> women at a bar. After he meets a woman {{recovering}} from her own divorce, he has to leave her {{to speak to a}} prostitute whom he sees across the room with a prosthetic hand and fingernails painted {{in the same way as}} the Ice Truck Killer's first victim. Working on a hunch that the Ice Truck Killer is an acrotomophiliac, Angel decides to speak to Debra's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper, a prosthetics specialist and (unbeknownst to anyone else) the actual Ice Truck Killer. Rudy cooperates with the interview upon realizing that Angel does not know his identity. Later, Angel is stabbed in a parking lot by a masked man. Angel manages to elbow him in the face before two men scare the attacker off. Minutes later, Rudy - who had earlier fallen out with Debra due to secretly having dinner with Dexter - arrives with flowers. They kiss, but Rudy backs away complaining of a cut lip, suggesting that he was Angel's attacker.|$|E
5|$|Firs Park {{was located}} {{to the south}} of the canal in the centre of Falkirk, named after the street in which it was situated, Firs Street. The club moved to the ground in 1921 and in the same year, the club's record {{attendance}} was set at a Scottish Cup match against Partick Thistle when 12,000 spectators attended. Firs Park was East Stirlingshire's home for 87 years, except a solitary season in 1964 when the club played at Kilbowie Park in Clydebank after being controversially merged with Clydebank Juniors. As a result of the merger, Firs Park was closed, however, after only one season, the merger was disbanded and East Stirlingshire moved back to the ground, where it remained {{until the end of the}} 2007–08 season. The decision was taken by the club to close Firs Park due to the prohibitive costs of potential refurbishing <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>new</b> Scottish Football Association stadium criteria. At the time of closure, the ground had a capacity of 1,800 with 200 seated in the main stand.|$|E

5|$|For {{those who}} are single when injured or who become single, SCI causes {{difficulties}} and insecurities with respect to one's ability <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>new</b> partners and start relationships. In some settings, beauty standards cause people to view disabled bodies as less attractive, limiting the options for sexual and romantic partners {{of people with disabilities}} like SCI. Furthermore, physical disabilities are stigmatized, causing people to avoid contact with disabled people, particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI. The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self-consciousness and embarrassment in public. They can increase their social success by using impression management techniques to change how they are perceived and create a more positive image of themselves in others' eyes. Physical limitations create difficulties; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners. Difficulties with mobility and the lack of disabled accessibility of social spaces (e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps) create a further barrier to social activity and limit the ability to meet partners. Isolation and its associated risk of depression can be limited by participating in physical activities, social gatherings, clubs, and online chat and dating.|$|E
5|$|When the Second World War broke out, {{only limited}} {{resources}} where allotted to the defence of Northern Sweden, but following the Soviet attack on Finland {{a few months}} later and the German Operation Weserübung against Norway and Denmark the next year, major work on improving and extending the defensive lines was commenced. Bunkers, bomb shelters, gun emplacementsparticularly for anti-tank gunswere built by the units that had been mobilised and stationed in the vicinity of Boden. The Finnish experiences gained from meeting superior armoured forces during the Winter War were adopted in Sweden, and triple rows of large stones or blocks of reinforced concrete, dragon's teeth, soon formed a continuous linedefended by anti-tank guns in concrete bunkers and machine-gun nestsaround the fortress and city. As the war continued and advances in most fields of warfare were made, Boden Fortress was continually improved <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>new</b> or increased threats such as air, armoured or gas attacks. The command, supply and intelligence services were improved as well.|$|E
