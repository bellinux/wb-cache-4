500|$|On November 24, 2014, Sandoval [...] {{came to an}} {{agreement}} with the Boston Red Sox on a five-year, $90 million contract with a sixth year club option of $17 million or a $5 million buy-out. The deal was officially announced on November 25. Sandoval said, [...] "It was a tough decision for me. It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to be sure that I was going to make the right decision... But I want a new challenge. I made that choice to be here in Boston because I need a new challenge." [...] In 126 games of 2015, Sandoval batted [...]245 with 10 home runs and 47 RBI, all career lows since his first full season in 2009.|$|E

Sports, Jackson says that: [...] "It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> {{to get over}} the fact that I {{was the only one that}} didn't make it to the NBA from the Fab Five, but I'm over it because I'm back home and I'm happy with what I'm doing with my life." ...|$|E

After appearing on the show for three years, James decided to quit and the character was killed off. She stated, [...] "It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to decide to leave Shortland Street because it isn't easy {{to walk away from}} something you love. I also had this fear I'd never get work again – it's a real fear. So it <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to wrestle with the idea that saying no to work wasn't unwise, and that if you actually want to grow and develop as an actor you do have to stop and move on." [...] She found her final scenes draining, [...] "Everyone was acting around me and I was there, but my acting had basically stopped. I remember lying there thinking, 'I’m going to miss all these people.' I was quite teary, actually." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reflecting in 1993 on his {{relatively}} late {{start in}} writing fiction, DeLillo said [...] "I wish I had started earlier, but evidently I wasn’t ready. First, I lacked ambition. I {{may have had}} novels in my head but very little on paper and no personal goals, no burning desire to achieve some end. Second, I didn’t {{have a sense of}} {{what it takes to be}} a serious writer. It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to develop this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Levy {{has said}} that his views on Israel's {{policies}} toward the Palestinians developed only after joining Haaretz. [...] "When I first started covering the West Bank for Haaretz, I was young and brainwashed," [...] {{he said in an}} interview. [...] "I would see settlers cutting down olive trees and soldiers mistreating Palestinian women at the checkpoints, and I would think, 'These are exceptions, not part of government policy.' It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to see that these were not exceptions – they were the substance of government policy." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Tumble and Fall", {{the third}} track on Pushing the Senses, {{was chosen as}} its lead single, because their European label Play it Again Sam (PIAS), were getting more {{involved}} with the band, believing the song would be a crossover to make them successful in Europe after touring with Coldplay in 2003. The single became the band's most successful single release since [...] "Buck Rogers", reaching the top five in the UK. Grant claimed that [...] "Tumble and Fall" [...] is a love song, but can be interpreted in any way. In an interview with Feederweb, Grant said of the song: [...] "Again {{this is about the}} ups and downs of life. Its about life in general and how you deal with it. It covers the journey of life and how you have to take the ups with the downs. I wasn’t going to record this song. It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to finish it, to be happy with it, because the song went through various stages. I wasn’t sure if we really needed a tune like that on the album. But I decided to go to the studio to record an acoustic version just to see what happened and that’s how the song started. It was a completely one take vocal, live with the acoustic guitar and we built everything else around it. It is an acoustic track that grew into what it is now. So that was the only song that we recorded like that on the album, so it is a bit different for that reason and is probably why it has an organic feel to it".|$|E

60|$|The work <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> When at last I {{folded up}} {{the papers and}} slipped them once more inside my blouse it was close upon two. I {{wondered}} why Theodore had not returned with our luncheon, but on going to the little anteroom which divides my office from the outer door, great was my astonishment to see him lolling there on the rickety chair which he affectioned, and half asleep. I had some difficulty in rousing him. Apparently he had got rather drunk while he was out, and had then returned and slept some of his booze off, without thinking that I might be hungry and needing my luncheon.|$|E
6000|$|... "And this stuff," [...] he continued, [...] "will {{set you up}} {{in a day or}} two. It's as good as quinine, any day; and you've no notion what {{wonderful}} cures that medicine effects. It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> too, to {{find the}} right tree. I wandered over two or three leagues of country before I came upon one. Luckily it was a fine sunny day, and I enjoyed it much. I wish you had been with me, Tom; but you'll be all right soon. I lay down, too, once or twice in the sunshine, and put my head in the long grass, and tried to fancy myself in a miniature forest. Did you ever try that, Tom!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I daresay; {{but just}} now I {{feel that it}} would <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to get tired of it, if it were all as charming as today. Everything loves June. Davy-boy, why this melancholy November face in blossom-time?" ...|$|R

I couldn't. No. Losing a lover, that's a thing for oneself. I've been through that, you see. But a son's more outside you. Altogether. And more your own making. It's not losing a thing in you; it's losing a hope and a pride.... Once when I was a little boy I did a drawing very carefully. It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time....</b> And a big boy tore it up. For no {{particular}} reason. Just out of cruelty.... That--that was exactly like losing Hugh...." ...|$|E

He dropped the subject at last suddenly with a [...] "Never mind; that's all done with"; nor did he again refer to the subject, though we passed together the rest of the afternoon, and I accompanied him, on his departure, to the doors of the waiting-room at St. Lazare. I felt myself strangely alone; a voice told me that I had rejected both the counsels of wisdom and the helping hand of friendship; and as I passed through the great bright city on my homeward way, I measured {{it for the first time}} with the eye of an adversary.|$|E
6000|$|... "Six dollars. Think of it! A boat like this! Of course I {{done a lot}} of work, an' {{the sail}} cost two dollars, the oars one forty, an' the paint one seventy-five. But just the same eleven dollars and fifteen cents is a real bargain. It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> saving for it, though. I carry papers morning and evening--there's a boy taking my route for me this afternoon--I give 'm ten cents, an' all the extras he sells is his; and I'd a-got the boat sooner only I had to pay for my {{shorthand}} lessons. My mother wants me to become a court reporter. They get sometimes as much as twenty dollars a day. Gee! But I don't want it. It's a shame to waste the money on the lessons." ...|$|E

It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> and I begun to think maybe my guess was wrong, but at last I struck it. It laid over by the bulkhead, and was nearly the color of the carpet. It was a little round plug about as thick as the end of your little finger, and I says to myself there's a di'mond in the nest you've come from. Before long I spied out the plug's mate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes'm," [...] replied Peter, [...] "I visited him, but I didn't {{find out}} much. He's a regular old grouch. He isn't {{the least bit}} neighborly.

When I did find him, {{he gave me a}} terrible scare. I didn't see him until I was right on top of him, and if I hadn't jumped, and jumped quickly, I guess I wouldn't be here this morning. He was lying flat down in the grass and he was so very flat that I just didn't see him. When I told him that I wanted to know all about him and his ways, he replied that it was none of my {{business}} how he lived or what he did, and that was all I could get out of him.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the state}} I was it <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to compose this much, and I had barely {{finished}} it {{when there was}} a knock at the outer door. There was Andre. He had the immobility of face which sometimes goes with the mulatto, and always with the trained servant, as he informed me that Monsieur le Medecin was not at home, but that he had left word. There was an epidemic, Monsieur, so Andre feared. I gave him the note and his directions, and ten minutes after he had gone I would have given much to have called him back. How about Antoinette, alone at Les Iles? Why had I not thought of her? We had told her nothing that morning, Madame la Vicomtesse and I, after our conference with Nick. For the girl had shut herself in her room, and Madame had thought it best not to disturb her at such a stage. But would she not be alarmed when Helene failed to return that night? Had circumstances been different, I myself would have ridden to Les Iles, but no inducement now could make me desert the post I had chosen. After many years I dislike to recall to memory that long afternoon which I spent, helpless, in the Rue Bourbon. Now I was on my feet, pacing restlessly the short breadth of the room, trying to shut out from my mind the horrors of which my ears gave testimony. Again, in the intervals of quiet, I sat with my elbows on the table and my head in my hands, striving to allay the throbbing in my temples. Pains came and went, and at times I felt like a fagot flung into the fire,--I, who had never known a sick day. At times my throat pained me, an odd symptom in a warm climate. Troubled as I was in mind and body, the thought of Helene's quiet heroism upheld me through it all. More than once I had my hand raised to knock at the bedroom door and ask if I could help, but I dared not; at length, the sun having done its worst and spent its fury, I began to hear steps along the banquette and voices almost at my elbow beyond the little window. At every noise I peered out, hoping for the doctor. But he did not come. And then, as I fell back into the fauteuil, there was borne on my consciousness a sound I had heard before. It was the music of the fiddler, it was a tune I knew, and the voices of the children were singing the refrain:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it will <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{time to find}} out!"

I was patient now, however, for I felt that I had only to wait; and in fact {{at the end of}} the week, one lovely evening after dinner, she stepped into my gondola, to which in honor of the occasion I had attached a second oar.|$|R

"The {{animosity}} shown {{towards me}} by your father," [...] he wrote, in this coldest of marital epistles, [...] "is such that I cannot return again to a roof which is his, {{even though it}} shelters you. A parting is unavoidable, as you are sure {{to be on his}} side in this division.

6000|$|They {{were very}} lively and naïve.--But some were more difficult. Every {{conceivable}} sort of [...] "woman" [...] was there, broad shouldered and with rather large feet. The most usual was the semi-peasant, {{with a very}} full bosom and very full skirt and a very downright bearing. But one was a widow in weeds, drooping {{on the arm of}} a robust daughter. And one was an ancient crone in a crochet bed-cover. And one was in an old skirt and blouse and apron, with a broom, wildly sweeping the street from end to end. He was an animated rascal. He swept with very sarcastic assiduity in front of two town-misses in fur coats, who minced very importantly along. He swept their way very humbly, facing them and going backwards, sweeping and bowing, whilst they advanced with their noses in the air. He made his great bow, and they minced past, daughters of dog-fish, pesce-carne, no doubt. Then he skipped with a bold, gambolling flurry behind them, and with a perfectly mad frenzy began to sweep after them, as if to sweep their tracks away. He swept so madly and so blindly with his besom that he swept on to their heels and their ankles. They shrieked and glowered round, but the blind sweeper saw them not. He swept and swept and pricked their thin silk ankles. And they, scarlet with indignation and rage, gave hot skips like cats on hot bricks, and fled discomfited forwards. He bowed once more after them, and started mildly and innocently to sweep the street. A pair of lovers of fifty years ago, she in a half crinoline and poke bonnet and veil, hanging on his arm came very coyly past, oh so simpering, and it <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> {{to be sure that the}} [...] "girl" [...] was a youth. An old woman in a long nightdress prowled up and down, holding out her candle and peering in the street as if for burglars. She would approach the real young women and put her candle in their faces and peer so hard, as if she suspected them of something. And they blushed and turned their faces away and protested confusedly. This old woman searched so fearfully in the face of one strapping lass in the pink and scarlet costume, who looked for all the world like a bunch of red and rose-pink geraniums, with a bit of white,--a real peasant lass--that the latter in a panic began to beat him with her fist, furiously, quite aroused. And he made off, running comically in his long white nightdress.|$|E

Gutman became the first employee of Video Game Player (later Computer Games) in 1982. He said, [...] "I started {{a magazine}} about video games and suddenly I was an expert in video games. I started writing about them and computers. All for grownups. It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to realize that writing for grownups was not my thing.
