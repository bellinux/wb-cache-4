5000|$|This {{model was}} first marketed in 1893, and {{was built on}} the same {{principles}} as the New Model. It added a straight three-row QWERTY keyboard, and as Model No. 4 it also offered a <b>two-color</b> <b>ribbon.</b> The elaborate decorations had by now given way to a comparatively sober design.FASFAS ...|$|E
5000|$|There was an [...] "accounting" [...] {{model with}} an ultra-wide {{carriage}} and <b>two-color</b> <b>ribbon</b> for printing out wide financial reports. The Friden accounting model was called [...] "5010 COMPUTYPER" [...] and {{was capable of}} arithmetic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication & division) at electronic speeds and to print the results automatically in a useful document.|$|E
25|$|Some colored ribbons (such as brown) {{were also}} available. The ribbon {{cartridge}} mechanism {{did not allow}} the use of <b>two-color</b> <b>ribbons,</b> such as black and red, that had been common on earlier typewriters.|$|R
2500|$|Hubertia defined its {{fraternity}} colors green-gold-black on February 7, 1897. These {{colors are}} worn {{in the form}} a ribbon with a golden percussion (rim) [...] diagonally across the chest, as it is typical for European fraternities. The common fraternity cap is the green Tellermütze or the more traditional Stürmer in dark-green. The freshly admitted (pledging [...] "fox") members wear the <b>two-colored</b> <b>ribbon</b> in green-and-gold. To official fraternity events, some members might additionally wear a traditional green jacket, an adapted version of the contemporary chief forester's jacket typical for the Elsass, a former German region bordering France. This jacket is then combined with a Hirschfänger, a specific style of hunting dagger, on the side.|$|R
5000|$|The console {{typewriter}} is {{the product}} of a company named Soroban Engineering. It uses an IBM Model B Electric typewriter mechanism, modified by the addition of switches to detect keypresses, and solenoids to activate the typebars. It uses a traditional typebar mechanism, not the [...] "golfball" [...] IBM Selectric typewriter mechanism, which was not introduced until the next year. Lettercase is selected by raising and lowering the massive type basket. The Soroban is equipped with a <b>two-color</b> inked <b>ribbon</b> (red and black), and the interface allows color selection. Programs commonly use color-coding to distinguish user input from machine responses. The Soroban mechanism is unreliable and prone to jamming, particularly when shifting case or changing ribbon color.|$|R
2500|$|Dry {{correction}} products (such as correction paper) under {{brand names}} such as [...] "Ko-Rec-Type" [...] were introduced in the 1970s and functioned like white carbon paper. A strip of the product was placed over the letters needing correction, and the incorrect letters were retyped, causing the black character to be overstruck with a white overcoat. Similar material was soon incorporated in carbon-film electric typewriter ribbons; like the traditional <b>two-color</b> black-and-red inked <b>ribbon</b> common on manual typewriters, {{a black and white}} correcting ribbon became commonplace on electric typewriters. But the black or white coating could be partly rubbed off with handling, so such corrections were generally not acceptable in legal documents.|$|R
