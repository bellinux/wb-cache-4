5|$|From Liverpool's {{point of}} view, the {{situation}} was that Shankly had retired and the club had to move on. Shankly did not understand that by turning up for training at Melwood, he was effectively undermining Bob Paisley, who had succeeded him as manager, {{even to the point}} of actually taking over the training. Tommy Smith recalled that Shankly as manager never ran training and would only speak to Paisley, Fagan and Bennett about what needed to be done. But, as a visitor at Melwood he began to intervene and Paisley's initial pleasure on seeing him soon turned to polite embarrassment. Eventually, Paisley had <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Shankly that he didn't work there any more, that it was now Paisley's team and that he had things which he wanted to do with the team.|$|E

Her family and his {{attended}} the wedding, but several incidents illustrated once again how German society treated her as [...] "invisible". When she and Alexander went to get their marriage license, the registrar greeted Alexander, wrote down his name, and then asked [...] "Where is the bride?" [...] As they were descending the courthouse steps after their wedding, a passerby offered wedding congratulations to the maid of honor. She ignored the incidents even though [...] "I am troubled by this continual need <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> others that it is I who am getting married." [...] After six years she and Alexander divorced.|$|E
500|$|In April 1994, Professor Elizabeth Newson {{published}} Video Violence and the Protection of Children (the [...] "Newson Report") which attracted huge media {{interest due}} to its claims that it had [...] "definitively established the long sought-for link between screen violence and the real-life variety," [...] and which cited the Capper murder as an example. Despite its support by the press, however, the report failed to demonstrate any definitive link, [...] "merely drawing inferences from... often highly speculative accounts in the press rather than independent first-hand research." [...] Newson was called {{to give oral evidence}} to the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee on Video Violence, where she asserted: [...] "The Suzanne Capper case is another example of very explicit imitation of video and the use of video and that was Child's Play 3." [...] The chairman of the committee, Sir Ivan Lawrence had <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Newson that this was incorrect, and that both the police and the British Board of Film Classification had ruled out any connection between the movie and the murder.|$|E

500|$|Efforts to {{purchase}} or have built ironclad warships were unsuccessful despite Bulloch's best efforts. Buying them was never seriously considered, as the Royal Navy would {{not care to}} give any of its best ships to a foreign power, no matter how favorably disposed. Contracts were made with private shipyards in both Britain and France to build rams to Confederate naval specifications, but their ultimate purpose could not be disguised. They therefore directly violated the neutrality laws, and American (that is, Union) officials immediately informed the governments of their existence. For a while, Her Majesty's Government chose to {{turn a blind eye}} on developments, but the Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg caused them to reconsider. On September 5, 1863, Ambassador Charles Francis Adams sent a message to Foreign Minister Lord John Russell informing him that the first of the ironclads was about to leave, and that [...] "it would be superfluous in me <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> your Lordship that this means war." [...] The ship was not permitted to leave and was later seized for the Royal Navy. As the French government had implicitly agreed to follow Britain's lead concerning North America, all the contracts were voided.|$|E

But with the same storylines being told in different variations, it's {{hard not to be}} frustrated by seeing characters start to travel down the path they just reached the end of not long before. Hopefully the next time they find resolution to these conflicts, it will prove to have a more lasting impact and allow them to journey somewhere new." [...] It was also the final episode reviewed by the site.|$|E
2500|$|In his dissent, Justice Powell {{pointed out}} that a lawyer's primary task, even in a [...] "routine" [...] divorce case, is one of {{diagnosis}} and advice: <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the client concerns of which {{he might not be}} aware, and ensure that the client addresses those concerns. Powell thought it difficult to enumerate a value for this aspect of legal representation, and hence for consumers to sense how much diagnosis and advice they could expect for a fixed, advertised price. Consequently, {{it is not possible to}} know whether Bates's and O'Steen's assertion that their fees were [...] "reasonable" [...] was an accurate one. [...] "Whether a fee is 'very reasonable' is a matter of opinion, and not a matter of verifiable fact as the Court suggests. [...] One unfortunate result of today's decision is that lawyers may feel free to use a wide variety of adjectives — such as 'fair,' 'moderate,' 'low-cost,' or 'lowest in town' — to describe the bargain they offer to the public." ...|$|E
2500|$|The War Cabinet {{ordered a}} review of the {{situation}} but the manning difficulties could not be resolved. [...] The Foreign Office reluctantly agreed that the MACs would have to operate under the Red Ensign, provided that the merchant seamen and their unions were made aware of the risks involved, and that every possible precaution would be taken to ensure that the men did not fall into enemy hands. [...] In the event, there is little to suggest that the MACs' crews were ever formally notified that they might be at special risk. [...] There is evidence, however, that the authorities remained sensitive about the status of MAC ships which were specifically excluded from the publicity that was arranged for other 'special service' merchant ships, e.g. rescue ships. [...] As late as September 1944, masters were reminded <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> their crews the need to maintain secrecy about the MACs' operations and functions.|$|E

2500|$|Nolan’s gesture was imprecise, {{and pointed}} {{not to the}} redoubts and the {{captured}} British guns but, it seemed — at least to Lucan and his staff officers present — to the Russian battery guarding Ryzhov's cavalry {{at the end of}} the valley. Seeing Lucan's confusion, Nolan could have explained what Raglan intended, perhaps making the link – if he himself knew of the connection — between the third and fourth order; however, taken aback by Nolan's insolence, Lucan refused further discussion, and rode over to Cardigan standing in front of his brigade. Both cavalry commanders knew the dangers of attacking down the valley. When Cardigan learned what was expected of his brigade, he questioned the sanity of the order as conveyed to him by Lucan: [...] "… allow me <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> you that there is a battery in front, battery on each flank, and the ground is covered with Russian riflemen." ...|$|E
2500|$|John, however, clearly {{identifies}} Mary of Bethany {{with the}} woman who anointed Christ's feet (12; cf. [...] and [...] ). It is remarkable that already in , John has spoken of Mary as [...] "she that anointed the Lord's feet", he aleipsasa. It is commonly said that he refers to the subsequent anointing which he himself describes in {{but it may be}} questioned whether he would have used he aleipsasa if another woman, and she a [...] "sinner" [...] in the city, had done the same. It is conceivable that John, just because he is writing so long after the event {{and at a time when}} Mary was dead, wishes <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> us that she was really the same as the [...] "sinner." [...] In the same way Luke may have veiled her identity precisely because he did not wish to defame one who was yet living; he certainly does something similar in the case of St. Matthew whose identity with Levi the publican (5:7) he conceals. If the foregoing argument holds good, Mary of Bethany and the [...] "sinner" [...] are one and the same.|$|E
2500|$|Testifying as a {{prosecution}} witness, Russert {{said that although}} he and Libby did indeed speak on July 10, 2003, they never discussed Plame during their conversation. Libby had claimed he had forgotten {{by the time of}} the conversation with Russert that he had earlier learned Ms. Plame's job from Cheney around June 12, 2003. Libby also testified to the federal grand jury that when Russert purportedly told him about Plame, he had absolutely no memory of having heard the information earlier from anyone else, including Cheney, and was thus [...] "taken aback" [...] when Russert told him. Libby told the FBI that Russert told him on July 10 or 11, 2003, that she worked at the CIA and [...] "all the reporters knew that." [...] In his opening argument, Fitzgerald, referring to Libby's conversation with Russert on July 10, said: [...] "You can't be startled about something on Thursday [...] that you told other people about on Monday [...] and Tuesday [...]" [...] Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer testified as {{a prosecution}} witness that on July 7, 2003, Libby told Fleischer, [...] "Ambassador Wilson was sent by his wife. His wife works for the CIA." [...] Fleischer testified that Libby referred to Wilson's wife by her maiden name, Valerie Plame, and [...] "he added it was hush-hush, on the Q.T., and that most people didn't know it." [...] Libby was also alleged by prosecutors to have lied to the FBI and a federal grand jury in claiming that when he mentioned Plame's name to two reporters—Matthew Cooper, then of Time magazine, and Judith Miller, then of The New York Times—he was careful <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> them he was simply repeating rumors that he had heard from Russert. Cooper and Miller testified that Libby stated no such qualifications to them in telling them about Plame.|$|E
