5|$|Built in 1958, {{the village}} hall houses the village social club, {{which started in}} a small {{extension}} to <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>in</b> 1973. The club was extended in 1981, as the membership had grown to over 400. Ely Member of Parliament, Mr. Clement Freud, opened the new room, built mainly by members themselves, on 7May 1981.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1747, Fownes Luttrell made {{numerous}} and significant alterations to Dunster Castle, redecorating and redesigning {{it in the}} Rococo style. He renovated the Great Parlour, converted a bedroom over it into a Drawing Room in 1758, created a Breakfast Room over <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>in</b> 1772, remodelled {{the southern part of}} the castle, and altered the Great Staircase in 1773. His changes to the décor of the castle are also noteworthy, particularly for his use of newly-fashionable wallpaper.|$|E
5|$|Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine (1635–1708) oversaw a {{substantial}} remodelling {{of the house}} in 1684, and much of the existing south facade dates from that time. The end bays were heightened, and the central porch was rebuilt with stone quoins and pilasters, a balustraded top and a small tower and cupola. A plan from 1684 shows <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>in</b> the house's centre, with service rooms to the west and the main parlour to the east. On the first floor, the dining room was over the hall, the main bedchamber over the kitchen, and a lady's chamber over the porch.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that the castle evolved from the {{practice}} of fortifying a lordly home. The greatest threat to a lord's home or hall was fire as it was usually a wooden structure. To protect against this, and keep other threats at bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>in</b> stone; or raise it up on an artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers. While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is ancient, raising a motte is a medieval innovation.|$|E
5|$|Kingston {{lost its}} most {{influential}} advocate as permanent {{site of the}} Hockey Hall of Fame when Sutherland died in 1955. By 1958, the Hockey Hall of Fame had still not raised sufficient funds to construct a permanent building in Kingston. Clarence Campbell, then President of the NHL, grew tired {{of waiting for the}} construction to begin and withdrew the NHL's support to situate <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>in</b> Kingston. In the same year, the NHL and the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) reached an agreement to establish a new Hall of Fame building in Toronto, in the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame located at Exhibition Place. The temporary Hockey Hall of Fame opened as an exhibit within the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in August 1958, and 350,000 people visited it during the 1958 CNE fair. Due {{to the success of the}} exhibit, NHL and CNE decided that a permanent home in the Exhibition Place was needed. The NHL agreed to fully fund the building of the new facility on the grounds of Exhibition Place, and construction began in 1960. The first permanent Hockey Hall of Fame, which shared a building with the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, was opened on August 26, 1961, by Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. Over 750,000 people visited <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>in</b> its inaugural year. Admission to the Hockey Hall of Fame was free until 1980, when the Hockey Hall of Fame facilities underwent expansion.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many old}} buildings, Ordsall Hall has stories of hauntings. The White Lady who {{is said to}} appear in the Great Hall or Star Chamber is popularly {{believed}} to be Margaret Radclyffe, who died of a broken heart in 1599 following the death at sea of her twin, Alexander. There are webcams overseeing the areas that are said to be the most haunted. An episode of the television programme Most Haunted was filmed in <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>in</b> 2005.|$|E

5|$|Mickey Vernon {{became the}} first manager of the Texas Rangers in 1961, serving for just over two seasons. Ron Washington has managed more games and seasons than any other manager in Rangers history.

Ted Williams is the only Rangers manager to have been {{inducted}} into the Baseball Hall of Fame; Whitey Herzog, who was elected to <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>in</b> 2009 and will be inducted in July 2010, will become the only Rangers manager to earn induction as a manager (Williams was inducted for his playing career).|$|E
5|$|The Queens Hall {{opened in}} 1957, it was {{originally}} Victoria Road Weslyan Methodist Chapel. It was in use as a theatre and concert hall until the opening of The Brindley in Runcorn in 2004. The Queens Hall was demolished (December 2011 – February 2012). Adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>in</b> Lacey Street, is the Queen's Hall Studio, originally built as a Sunday School in 1879. It was a venue for music and live performance but closed in 2004. After years of campaigning by the volunteer group Loose, and {{with the support of}} the Community Assets Fund/Big Lottery Fund and WREN and other donors, it re-opened on 17 April 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert hall}} {{had its own}} {{in-house}} orchestra by November, and ticket sales for concerts accounted for 43% of the pier's revenue by 1920. The West Pier was favoured by locals, while the Palace Pier was used more by day trippers. A top-deck entrance was added to <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>in</b> 1932. The pier's central decking was removed during World War II to prevent enemy landings, and its popularity began to decline. On 26 November 1944 a Royal Air Force Hawker Typhoon fighter hit the pier, crashing onto the beach. The pilot sustained head injuries. The Typhoon {{was one of four}} aircraft escorting a VIP flight.|$|E

5|$|A {{bank and}} ditch {{enclosure}} {{was a simple}} form of defence, and when found without an associated motte is called a ringwork; when the site was in use for a prolonged period, it was sometimes replaced by a more complex structure or enhanced {{by the addition of}} a stone curtain wall. Building <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>in</b> stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door. This led to the elevation of windows to the first floor– to make it harder to throw objects in– and to change the entrance from ground floor to first floor. These features are seen in many surviving castle keeps, which were the more sophisticated version of halls. Castles were not just defensive sites but also enhanced a lord's control over his lands. They allowed the garrison to control the surrounding area, and formed a centre of administration, providing the lord with a place to hold court.|$|E
5|$|The Siddheshwara {{temple in}} the Haveri {{district}} has sculptures of deities of multiple faiths.

Shiva is depicted with four arms, holding his attributes: the damaru (drum), the aksamala (chain of beads) and the trishul (trident) in three arms. His lower left arm rests on Uma, who is seated on Shiva's lap, embracing him with her right arm while gazing into his face. The sculpture of Uma is well decorated with garlands, large earrings and curly hair.|$|E

Patrick Ewing (Georgetown), Richard Hamilton (Connecticut), Troy Bell (Boston College), Troy Murphy (Notre Dame) and Kris Dunn (Providence) each won the award twice, and Chris Mullin (St. John's) won three consecutive times from 1983 through 1985. Three award winners have been inducted as players to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Ewing, who shared the award in 1984 and 1985 with Mullin, was inducted in 2008 after playing 17years in the National Basketball Association between 1985 and 2002. Mullin followed in 2011 after a 16-year NBA career (1985–2001). Most recently, Georgetown's 1992 Player of the Year Alonzo Mourning entered <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>in</b> 2014 following a 16-year NBA career (1992–2008).
