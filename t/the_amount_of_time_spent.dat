5|$|Primarily a nocturnal grazer, the bohor reedbuck {{may also}} feed at daytime. A {{study showed that}} feeding peaked at dawn and late afternoon. In the night, two feeding peaks were {{observed}} once again: at dusk and midnight. They traverse {{a long way from}} their daytime refuges while grazing. Seasonal differences in <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> while grazing in a particular area is possibly related to the availability and quality of grasses there. The bohor reedbuck often grazes in association with other grazers such as hartebeest, topi, puku and kob. In Kenyan farmlands, the reedbuck may feed on growing wheat and cereals.|$|E
5|$|The FMCSA is a {{division}} of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), which is generally responsible for enforcement of FMCSA regulations. The driver of a CMV is required to keep a record of working hours using a log book, outlining the total number of hours spent driving and resting, as well as the time at which the change of duty status occurred. In lieu of a log book, a motor carrier may keep track of a driver's hours using Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs), which automatically record <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> driving the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and increase <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this {{can also lead to}} less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E

5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} turtle {{hunting and}} spear fishing patterns in a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains for <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> turtle hunting or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, {{members of the community}} know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle hunting and spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal of skill or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle hunting and spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success than less skilled hunters.|$|E
5|$|According to {{director}} Hajime Tanigawa, its gameplay {{was based}} around prevalent South Korean online role-playing games for PC. Tanigawa joined when the title shifted {{to being an}} MMORPG, and he estimated development time in this form at ten months. At the beginning of development, the team decided to release a working form of the game within a year. This was managed by narrowing <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> on the early concept work, instead taking inspiration directly from other titles, including titles within the Megami Tensei series: Tanigawa said that without this, development might have lasted up to three years. When the closed beta began, many of the game's final functions {{had yet to be}} implemented. A free-to-play model was adopted as the team wanted to bring in the maximum number of players into the game. While making the game completely free and using in-game advertising as a means of earning money was an option, this had yet to become commercially viable in Japan at the time. In early 2007, CAVE partnered with Gung Ho Online Entertainment, a Japanese company experienced with online games who could co-manage the game with CAVE. According to Tanigawa, the partnership with Gung Ho Online opened up the possibility of expansion into Asian and Western markets.|$|E

25|$|As with {{orthodox}} 20-over cricket, {{each team}} faces 120 deliveries, however {{instead of being}} split into 20 six-ball overs, these are split into 15 eight-ball overs. This reduces <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> moving between overs and enables {{the same amount of}} cricket to be played in a shorter time.|$|E
25|$|The first method {{requires}} single perfect matches {{between the}} query and database sequences i.e. the two k-mer words {{are exactly the}} same. This approach is not considered the most practical. This is because a small k-mer size is {{necessary in order to}} achieve high levels of sensitivity, but this increases the number of false positive hits, thus increasing <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> in the alignment stage of the algorithm.|$|E

25|$|The Lyttelton Port Company has {{announced}} {{that they will be}} installing an extended siding at Lyttelton to enable them to handle longer freight trains. The new 24-wagon siding will replace two existing 8-wagon sidings which will reduce <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> on marshaling the trains. The move is part of a plan to increase their annual container capacity by 40,000 TEUs to approximately 300,000 and to increase the use of the port-to-city container shuttle rail service. Long-term the port hopes to move its operations to new wharves and to remove the existing wharves in front of the town.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that Facebook causes {{negative}} effects on self-esteem by triggering feelings of envy, with vacation and holiday photos proving {{to be the largest}} resentment triggers. Other prevalent causes of envy include posts by friends about family happiness and images of physical beauty—such envious feelings leave people lonely and dissatisfied with their own lives. A joint study by two German universities discovered that one out of three people were more dissatisfied with their lives after visiting Facebook, and another study by Utah Valley University found that college students felt worse about their own lives following an increase in <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> on Facebook.|$|E

25|$|Public demand {{caused the}} {{government}} in October 1940 to build new deep shelters within the Underground to hold 80,000 people but the period of heaviest bombing had passed before they were finished. By the end of 1940 improvements {{had been made in}} the Underground and in many other large shelters. Authorities provided stoves and bathrooms and canteen trains provided food. Tickets were issued for bunks in large shelters, to reduce <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> queuing. Committees quickly formed within shelters as informal governments and organisations such as the British Red Cross and the Salvation Army worked to improve conditions. Entertainment included concerts, films, plays and books from local libraries.|$|E
25|$|The {{same year}} Roméo premiered, Berlioz was {{appointed}} Conservateur Adjoint (Deputy Librarian) Paris Conservatoire Library. Berlioz supported {{himself and his}} family by writing musical criticism for Paris publications, primarily Journal des débats for over thirty years, and also Gazette musicale and Le rénovateur. While his career as a critic and writer provided him with a comfortable income, and he had an obvious talent for writing, he came to detest <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> attending performances to review, as it severely limited his free time to promote his own works and produce more compositions. Despite his prominent position in musical criticism, he did not use his articles to promote his own works.|$|E

The particular slang used by gay men as well as lesbians has been recorded in a number of specialist dictionaries, and according to researcher Greg Jacobs, is that the terminology listed in said dictionaries revolves heavily around sexual matters including terms for sex organs, preferences and activities, although Jacobs questions whether this accurately reflects <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> by gay people talking about sex and sexuality or whether it is down to methodological assumptions that conversations amongst LGBT people is primarily dominated with talk about sex.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} Neurotics Anonymous {{members in the}} Xochimilco borough of the Mexican Federal District found members {{presented}} with a heterogeneous composition of problems and disorders (including depression, suicidal ideation, obsessions, anxiety, sexual problems and somatic disorders). Most members were between 20 and 40 years old (73%) and were predominantly female (87%); coinciding with established social roles in the culture that men are alcoholics and women suffer from depression and other emotional problems. All members in the sample had average or below average levels of income. While members worked on average 2.5 hours per day and 87% were satisfied with <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> working per day (as it allowed them more time {{to participate in the}} group) 87% were also dissatisfied with their economic security.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the boys' school {{changed the}} way boys were educated at St. Peter's. Most {{instruction}} was now carried on indoors, in great contrast to the Native American way of life at the time (in which most time was spent outdoors). The boys were responsible for maintaining the kitchen garden, herding and feeding the small herd of beef cattle, and feeding and milking the dairy cattle, so some time each day was spent in the barns, corrals, or garden. Small fields, watered by irrigation ditches, were also maintained by the boys. The curriculum did not change throughout the year.
