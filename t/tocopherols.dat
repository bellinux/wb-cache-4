40|$|Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seeds have a <b>tocopherol</b> profile {{dominated}} by alpha-tocopherol. The {{objective of this}} research was to study the dynamics of <b>tocopherol</b> accumulation in sunflower lines with altered total <b>tocopherol</b> content or <b>tocopherol</b> profile. Developing seeds were sampled at regular intervals in two lines with reduced and increased total <b>tocopherol</b> content, respectively, and six lines with modified <b>tocopherol</b> profiles. The line with reduced <b>tocopherol</b> content showed a <b>tocopherol</b> accumulation rate reduced by half, whereas the line with increased <b>tocopherol</b> content showed a <b>tocopherol</b> accumulation rate twofold higher than the control. In the three cases, alpha-tocopherol followed a sigmoid accumulation pattern. Modified <b>tocopherol</b> profiles were expressed at early stages of <b>tocopherol</b> accumulation. In most lines with modified profiles, <b>tocopherol</b> accumulation pattern differed from the alpha-tocopherol lines, with maximum <b>tocopherol</b> content at 18 or 21 days after flowering (DAF) that was reduced to reach a plateau from 33 or 36 DAF onward. Such a reduction was caused by continued dry matter accumulation after <b>tocopherol</b> accumulation ceased or slowed down. In lines with increased levels of beta-tocopherol or both gamma- and delta-tocopherol, the synthesis of beta- and delta-tocopherol started and stopped earlier than the synthesis of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, respectively. © 2013 Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.

40|$|Phytyl {{diphosphate}} (PDP) is the prenyl precursor for <b>tocopherol</b> biosynthesis. Based {{on recent}} genetic evidence, PDP is supplied to the <b>tocopherol</b> biosynthetic pathway primarily by chlorophyll degradation and sequential phytol phosphorylation. Three enzymes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) {{are known to}} be capable of removing the phytol chain from chlorophyll in vitro: chlorophyllase 1 (CLH 1), CLH 2, and pheophytin pheophorbide hydrolase (PPH), which specifically hydrolyzes pheophytin. While PPH, but not chlorophyllases, is required for in vivo chlorophyll breakdown during Arabidopsis leaf senescence, {{little is known about the}} involvement of these phytol-releasing enzymes in <b>tocopherol</b> biosynthesis. To explore the origin of PDP for <b>tocopherol</b> synthesis, seed <b>tocopherol</b> concentrations were determined in Arabidopsis lines engineered for seed-specific overexpression of PPH and in single and multiple mutants in the three genes encoding known dephytylating enzymes. Except for modestly increasing <b>tocopherol</b> content observed in the PPH overexpressor, none of the remaining lines exhibited significantly reduced <b>tocopherol</b> concentrations, suggesting that the known chlorophyll-derived phytol-releasing enzymes do not play major roles in <b>tocopherol</b> biosynthesis. <b>Tocopherol</b> content of seeds from double mutants in NONYELLOWING 1 (NYE 1) and NYE 2, regulators of chlorophyll degradation, had modest reduction compared with wild-type seeds, although mature seeds of the double mutant retained significantly higher chlorophyll levels. These findings suggest that NYEs may play limited roles in regulating an unknown <b>tocopherol</b> biosynthesis-related phytol hydrolase. Meanwhile, seeds of wild-type over-expressing NYE 1 had lower <b>tocopherol</b> levels, suggesting that phytol derived from NYE 1 -dependent chlorophyll degradation probably doesn't enter <b>tocopherol</b> biosynthesis.

40|$|AbstractThe {{incorporation}} of radioactive alpha <b>tocopherol</b> by various brain regions of wild type and apolipoprotein E (apoE) -deficient mice was investigated. Labeled <b>tocopherol</b> was {{injected into the}} lateral cerebral ventricles of 11  weeks old, male mice. Radioactive cholesterol injected simultaneously {{was used as an}} internal standard to account for experimental variability. Most areas of the brain of apoE-deficient mice took up less of alpha <b>tocopherol</b> per mg of protein than wild type animals. However, specific activity of alpha <b>tocopherol</b> was higher in cerebellum, pons, hypothalamus, midbrain and cerebral cortex in apoE-deficient brains than the wild type. This could be due to (a) the lower levels of alpha <b>tocopherol</b> in apoE-deficient brain and (b) reductions in the clearance and transport of <b>tocopherol</b> (possibly mediated by apoE). <b>Tocopherol</b> uptake by hippocampus was unusual since it was lower in apoE deficiency whether the data were expressed as specific activity or per mg of protein. Nearly all of the injected alpha <b>tocopherol</b> remained unchanged in the brains of both apoE-deficient and wild type animals suggesting low turnover. Overall, the current data reinforce the hypothesis that apoE is a key protein involved with the transport and/or retention of alpha <b>tocopherol</b> in brain...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOur {{previous}} reports {{show that}} apolipoprotein E (apoE) influences {{the dynamics of}} alpha <b>tocopherol</b> (vitamin E) in brain. In this investigation, the patterns of depletion of alpha <b>tocopherol</b> from tissues of apoE deficient and wild type mice were compared after the animals were fed vitamin E deficient diets. Alpha <b>tocopherol</b> concentrations in specific regions {{of the brain and}} peripheral tissues at different times were determined by HPLC with electrochemical detection. ApoE deficiency significantly retarded the rate of depletion of alpha <b>tocopherol</b> from all regions of the brain. In addition, comparison of the rates of depletion of alpha <b>tocopherol</b> in both apoE deficient and wild type animals showed that cerebellum behaved differently from other areas such as cortex, hippocampus and striatum. This reinforces the uniqueness of cerebellum with regard to vitamin E biology. Patterns of depletion of <b>tocopherol</b> from peripheral tissues were different from brain. Serum <b>tocopherol</b> was higher in apoE deficient animals and remained higher than wild type during E deficiency. Depletion of liver <b>tocopherol</b> also tended to be unaffected by apoE deficiency. Our current and previous observations strongly suggest that apoE has an important role in modulating <b>tocopherol</b> concentrations in brain, probably acting in concert with other proteins as well...|$|R
40|$|Lipoprotein lipase {{appears to}} {{function}} as the mechanism by which dietary vitamin E (<b>tocopherol)</b> is transferred from chylomicrons to tissues. In patients with lipoprotein lipase deficiency, more than 85 % of both the circulating triglyceride and <b>tocopherol</b> is contained in the chylomicron fraction. The studies presented here show that the in vitro addition of bovine milk lipoprotein lipase (lipase) to chylomicrons {{in the presence of}} human erythrocytes or fibroblasts (and bovine serum albumin [BSA]) resulted in the hydrolysis of the triglyceride and the transfer of both fatty acids and <b>tocopherol</b> to the cells; in the absence of lipase, no increase in cellular <b>tocopherol</b> was detectable. The incubation system was simplified to include only fibroblasts, BSA, and Intralipid (an artificial lipid emulsion containing 10 % soybean oil, which has gamma but not alpha <b>tocopherol).</b> The addition of lipase to this system also resulted in the transfer of <b>tocopherol</b> (gamma) to the fibroblasts. Addition of both lipase and its activator, apolipoprotein CII, resulted in a further increase in the cellular <b>tocopherol</b> content, but apolipoprotein CII alone had no effect. Heparin, which is known to prevent the binding of lipoprotein lipase to the cell surface membrane, abrogated the transfer of <b>tocopherol</b> to fibroblasts without altering the rate of triglyceride hydrolysis. Thus, in vitro <b>tocopherol</b> is transferred to cells during hydrolysis of triglyceride by the action of lipase, and for this transfer of <b>tocopherol</b> to occur, the lipase itself must bind to the cell membrane...|$|R
5|$|Antioxidants {{are used}} as food {{additives}} to help guard against food deterioration. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping {{in the dark and}} sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers. However, as oxygen is also important for plant respiration, storing plant materials in anaerobic conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors. Consequently, packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. Antioxidants are an especially important class of preservatives as, unlike bacterial or fungal spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food. These preservatives include natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (AA, E300) and <b>tocopherols</b> (E306), as well as synthetic antioxidants such as propyl gallate (PG, E310), tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA, E320) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, E321).|$|E

40|$|<b>Tocopherol</b> {{belongs to}} the Vitamin E class of lipid soluble {{antioxidants}} that are essential for human nutrition. In plants, <b>tocopherol</b> is synthesized in plastids where it protects membranes from oxidative degradation by reactive oxygen species. <b>Tocopherol</b> cyclase (VTE 1) catalyzes the penultimate step of <b>tocopherol</b> synthesis, and an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant deficient in VTE 1 (vte 1) is totally devoid of <b>tocopherol.</b> Overexpression of VTE 1 resulted {{in an increase in}} total <b>tocopherol</b> of at least 7 -fold in leaves, and a dramatic shift from α-tocopherol to γ-tocopherol. Expression studies demonstrated that indeed VTE 1 is a major limiting factor of <b>tocopherol</b> synthesis in leaves. <b>Tocopherol</b> deficiency in vte 1 resulted in the increase in ascorbate and glutathione, whereas accumulation of <b>tocopherol</b> in VTE 1 overexpressing plants led to a decrease in ascorbate and glutathione. Deficiency in one antioxidant in vte 1, vtc 1 (ascorbate deficient), or cad 2 (glutathione deficient) led to increased oxidative stress and to the concomitant increase in alternative antioxidants. Double mutants of vte 1 were generated with vtc 1 and cad 2. Whereas growth, chlorophyll content, and photosynthetic quantum yield were very similar to wild type in vte 1, vtc 1, cad 2, or vte 1 vtc 1, they were reduced in vte 1 cad 2, indicating that the simultaneous loss of <b>tocopherol</b> and glutathione results in moderate oxidative stress that affects the stability and the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus...|$|R
40|$|Background: Conjugated {{linoleic}} acid (CLA) {{is known to}} affect the lipid metabolism in growing and lactating animals. However, potential effects on the metabolism of fat-soluble vitamins in lactating animals and co-occurring effects on their offspring are unknown. We aimed to investigate the effects of dietary CLA on concentrations of <b>tocopherol</b> in various tissues of lactating rats and their offspring and expression of genes involved in <b>tocopherol</b> metabolism. Methods: Twenty-eight Wistar Han rats were allocated to 2 groups and fed either a control diet (control group) or a diet containing 0. 9 % of cis- 9, trans- 11 and trans- 10, cis- 12 (1 : 1) CLA (CLA group) during pregnancy and lactation. Feed intake of dams and body weight of dams and their pups were recorded weekly. <b>Tocopherol</b> concentrations in various body tissues were determined at day 14 of lactation in dams and 1, 7 and 14 days after birth in pups. Expression of selected genes involved in metabolism of <b>tocopherol</b> was determined in dams and pups. The data were statistically analysed by analysis of variance. Results: Feed intake and body weight development of nursing rats and their pups was similar in both groups. In livers of CLA-fed dams, <b>tocopherol</b> concentrations decreased by 24 % but expression of TTPA and CYP 3 A 1, involved in <b>tocopherol</b> transport and metabolism, were not influenced. In the dams adipose tissue, gene expression of receptors involved in tissue <b>tocopherol</b> uptake, LDLR and SCARB 1, but not of LPL, increased by 30 to 50 % and <b>tocopherol</b> concentrations increased by 47 % in CLA-fed compared to control dams. Expression of LPL, LDLR and SCARB 1 in mammary gland was not influenced by CLA-feeding. <b>Tocopherol</b> concentrations in the pups livers and lungs were similar in both groups, but at 14 days of age, adipose tissue <b>tocopherol</b> concentrations, and LDLR and SCARB 1 expression, {{were higher in the}} CLA-exposed pups. Conclusions: We show that dietary CLA affects tissue concentrations of <b>tocopherol</b> in lactating rats and <b>tocopherol</b> metabolism in rats and pups, but hardly influences tissue <b>tocopherol</b> concentrations in their offspring. This indicates that supplementation of CLA in pregnant and lactating animals is uncritical considering the <b>tocopherol</b> status of new-borns...|$|R

Mutant plants lacked all four <b>tocopherol</b> forms and were deficient in <b>tocopherol</b> cyclase activity. Genetic mapping of vte 1 and a genomics-based approach led to the identification of the ORF At 4 g 32770 as a candidate gene for <b>tocopherol</b> cyclase. In vte 1, At 4 g 32770 contains a splicing site mutation and the corresponding mRNA expression is reduced.

The In Vivo study included the estimation of the Medium Effect Dose (MED 50) for <b>tocopherol</b> extraction by using Dose-Response Curve. The mean of MED 50 was 33. 6 mg/kg body weight (b. w.) of <b>tocopherol.</b> The results showed a significant increase (P< 0. 05) in testicular sperm concentration, epididymus sperm concentration and in the sperm count per gm of the testis, sperm motility percent, grade activity, sperm viability percent. While it was found a decrease in abnormal sperm morphology percent of epididymis caudal at MED 50 of <b>tocopherol.</b> Our results reveal that due to <b>tocopherol</b> administration; male rabbits fertility increases, thus being useful to any animal, mammals as well as human being...|$|R

Diabetes {{is a common}} cause of delayed wound healing. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the effect of topical administration of <b>tocopherol</b> cream on the wound healing process in diabetic rats. The study was conducted using 18 male Sprague Dawley rats which were divided into three groups: (I) diabetic rats receiving control cream (n = 6), (II) diabetic rats receiving 0. 06 % <b>tocopherol</b> cream (n = 6), and (III) diabetic rats receiving 0. 29 % <b>tocopherol</b> cream (n = 6). Four cutaneous wounds were created at the dorsal region of the rats. Wound healing was assessed by total protein content, rate of wound closure estimation, and histological studies on the tenth day after wounding. <b>Tocopherol</b> treatment enhanced the wound healing process by increasing rate of wound closure and total protein content significantly (P < 0. 05) compared to the control group. Histological observation also showed better organized epithelium and more collagen fibers in the <b>tocopherol</b> treated groups. Application of <b>tocopherol</b> cream enhances wound healing process in diabetic condition which is known to cause delay in wound healing. 1...|$|R
