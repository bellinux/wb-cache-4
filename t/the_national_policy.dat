Under that budget, Canada became a high-tariff nation like the United States and Germany.

5|$|Child labour in the industries, {{especially}} in match making factories, {{was at its}} peak during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1981, the child work force in the age group 4–16 was 30% of the total work force, 90% of whom were girls. In 1986, the National Child Labour project estimated child labour in Sivaksi match making industries to be 14,121 children. The estimates indicated 80% of the child labour belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), who were margianlised for centuries for cheap labour. Poverty and lack of farm produce were stated as {{the main reason for}} child labour. The employers also preferred children because of ease in management, discipline and lack of labour unions. The children in these industries suffered from back ache, neck ache, tuberclosis, malnutrition, gastointestinal disorders, dermatitis, respiratory disorders, over-exhaustion, burn injuries and water borne diseases due to exposure to harmful chemicals in the work environment. The situation of the child labour came to light during an accident of a bus transporting the children in 1976. The central government appointed a one-man committee under Harbans Singh in 1978, who reported abolishing child labour would seriously impact the economy of the region. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Policy</b> on child labour was formulated by the central government in August 1987, aiming at the rehabilitation of children withdrawn from these factories. In 1988, the union labour ministry initiated a programme for providing informal education, free health care and free lunch for children working in the factories. The Supreme Court of India, in a judgement ruled on December 1996 indicating provisions for preventing child labour like compensation for the child employed, employment to the adult members of the family and contribution to the corpus fund by the state government. From the establishment of child labour Act in 1986 till 2011, 150,000 inspections on child labour have been conducted in the factories, 1,500 cases have been registered and few prosecutions have been made. The results indicated small amount of child labour in cottage and house hold industries.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{assessing}} the implementation status of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Decentralisation <b>Policy</b> in Zomba District Council in Malawi given the current situation where the council is operating without ward councilors. It also undertook an exploration of factors affecting the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Decentralisation <b>Policy</b> in Zomba District Council and made recommendations which can positively contribute to the effective implementation of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Decentralisation <b>Policy</b> in Zomba District Council. Using both qualitative and quantitative research design, data for the study was collected using interviews, questionnaires and document analysis. The {{study found that the}} implementation of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Decentralisation <b>Policy</b> in Zomba District Council during the period under study was unsatisfactory. The major challenges to the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Decentralisation <b>Policy</b> in Zomba District Council were largely linked to the absence of councilors in the current council setup, violation of legal instruments governing the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Decentralisation <b>Policy</b> by <b>the</b> incumbent leadership, lack of political will among the ruling elite to see full implementation of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Decentralisation <b>Policy,</b> poor performance of structures operating in place of ward and council committees and inadequate finances at the disposal of Zomba District Council. The study concluded that Zomba District Council needed ward councilors to fully implement <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Decentralisation <b>Policy.</b> However <b>the</b> study also observed that {{it would be impossible to}} attain the objectives of the decentralization policy if there was no political will on the part of the incumbent leadership to see <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Decentralisation <b>Policy</b> implemented in full at Zomba District Council...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{society is}} very {{dependent}} on private car use and this dependence is increasing. Private car use {{on a large}} scale creates a variety of well documented problems including carbons emissions, health and safety concerns and land severance. Given these problems sustainable transport policies are becoming ever more important. Local Transport Plans (LTP) a local government mechanism are one way of implementing sustainable transport policy at a local level. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse how well <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>policies</b> are embedded in the LTPs and how this affects sustainable transport in the South West. A desk based analysis of the second round of LTPs (LTP 2) in the South West along with interviews of Council and independent participants were used to study how <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>policies</b> were incorporated and how effective at creating sustainable transport the LTP process is. A further desk based analysis of air quality in the South West was carried out to study how effective these actions were. The study showed that <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>policies</b> were well integrated into the LTP 2 s and interviews showed that <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>policies</b> were relevant to the South West and the LTPs would be key to creating sustainable transport. However two key problems were identified: these being the high dependence on private car use and the quality of public transport. It was clear that these problems might hinder the creation of sustainable transport. Analysis of the air quality showed a gradual increase in air quality. The analysis shows that the South West’s LTPs do integrate <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>policies</b> and <b>the</b> air quality data suggests that the measures set out in the plans are being effectively implemented. However there are still significant problems such as the dependence on private car use which will reduce the likelihood of creating long term sustainable transport in the South West.
