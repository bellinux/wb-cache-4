40|$|This paper {{relies on}} a Ramsey model with money to o¤er a simple theory of secular stagnation. The {{permanent}} failure of the economy to produce at full capacity results from three features: (i) The combination of the zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate and of an in ‡ation ceiling imposes a lower bound on the real interest rate; (ii) Some dynastic households have a high propensity to save, due to a preference for wealth; (iii) A downward wage rigidity breaks the de ‡ationary spiral resulting {{from the lack of}} demand. In this framework, I derive the paradox of ‡exibility, of thrift, and of toil. If the in ‡ation ceiling cannot be raised, then the government needs to rely on …scal policy to escape secular stagnation. However, a conventional …scal stimulus is not an e¢ cient response to a permanent liquidity trap, and can even be welfare reducing. The solution is instead to <b>tax</b> <b>household</b> wealth and to subsidize income from physical capital, through an investment subsidy or a reduction in the taxation of corporate income. This optimal policy is revenue neutral and implements the …rst-best allocation of resources.

40|$|The paper {{analysis}} {{a general}} equilibrium model with two periods, several households and a government that has to finance some expenditures {{in the first period}}. Households may have some private information either about their type (adverse selection) or about some action levei chosen in the first period that affects the probability of certain states of nature in the second period (moral hazard). Trade of financiai assets are intermediated by a finite collection of banks. Banks objective functions are determined in equilibrium by shareholders. Due to private information it may be optimal for the banks to introduce constraints in the set of available portfolios for each household as wellas household specific asset prices. In particular, households may face distinct interest rates for holding the risk-free asset. The government finances its expenditures either by <b>taxing</b> <b>households</b> in the first period or by issuing bonds in the first period and <b>taxing</b> <b>households</b> in the second period. Taxes may be state-dependent. Suppose government policies are neutml: i) government policies do not affect the distribution of wealth across households; and ii) if the government decides to <b>tax</b> a <b>household</b> in the second period there is a portfolio available for the banks that generates the Mme payoff in each state of nature as the <b>household</b> <b>taxes.</b> Tben, Ricardian equivalence holds if and only if an appropriate boundary condition is satisfied. Moreover, at every free-entry equilibrium the boundary condition is satisfied and thus Ricardian equivalence holds.

The purpose of energy tax harmonization {{is to reach}} more efficient use of energy among members and thereby to establish more competitive markets in EU.

We use as our framework a two-region general equilibrium model with a given freely-mobile supply of labour. We assume inter-regional migration to occur in response to inter-regional utility differentials. Each region has households, firms and a regional government. In addition to regional governments, there is a federal government. The firms in a region use a single factor, labour, to produce a single good which we assume to be different to that produced in the other region. It is supplied to households and to the regional government {{in the form of}} payroll <b>taxes.</b> <b>Households</b> consume some, trade some with households in the other region and give some up to the federal government as income <b>tax.</b> Firms and <b>households</b> bargain over wages and firms then choose employment to maximise profits.

The tax burdens resulting from taking a half-time minimum-wage job also vary greatly across states, and participants in AFDC and food stamps face median marginal tax rates significantly above the rates for all poor households. A consistent result, however, is that typical tax rates on the poor rarely exceed 60 percent when income changes resulting from incremental changes in monthly earnings are calculated.

The NBER TAXSIM model is used to calculate state income tax burdens for representative high-income households in 1986 - 1988.
