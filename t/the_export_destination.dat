40|$|Two nonexclusive {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward to explain why exporters enjoy higher productivity than do non-exporters: self-selection and learning-by-exporting. In {{the case of a}} small economy such as Ghana’s, we suspect that self-selection to export is less prevalent because of the high sunk cost of export market entry. While this sunk cost is considered high in the case of developing countries, its magnitude and persistence will vary by <b>the</b> <b>export</b> <b>destination.</b> The present paper evaluates how export destination influences export entry sunk cost. We use a dynamic probit model that corrects for the correlation between the error term and the lagged dependent variable and find African destinations to be associated with both lower and less persistent sunk costs of exporting relative to other export destinations.

30|$|To {{instrument}} the export-output ratio, we construct industry-specific {{weighted average}} real exchange rate index for exporting countries. We use the official US dollar exchange rate index adjusted for industry-specific price indices. The producer price indices of major export destination countries are weighted by their respective export shares from a given industry using trade flows from COMTRADE. The {{official exchange rate}} {{is assumed to be}} exogenous to firms in a four-digit ISIC industry and so also are producer prices in <b>the</b> <b>export</b> <b>destination</b> countries. In addition to this, we also use a weighted GDP index of export destination countries to capture demand shocks in partner countries using the export shares as weights. To be included in the calculation of the real exchange rate index and the GDP index, a destination country should account for at least 2.5  % of an industry’s exports from a sample country. The selected destination countries account on average for 90  % of industry-level exports from our sample.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the export-enhancing effect of foreign {{workers at the}} firm level. We first develop a theoretical framework of heterogeneous firms, assuming that foreign workers allow for productivity gains and convey valuable information on foreign markets. We illustrate that foreign workers foster exports at the extensive and the intensive margins. This effect can be decomposed in a general effect - to which any foreign worker contributes - and a destination-specific effect - to which only foreign workers who were born in <b>the</b> <b>export</b> <b>destination</b> contribute. We test these theoretical predictions using French firm-level data over the 1997 - 2008 period and a propensity score matching method to address endogeneity concerns. We find that foreign-born workers, and especially skilled individuals, foster exports at both margins. On average, a firm employing foreign-born workers exports 30 % more in value than a control firm. We find evidence that this increase is spread over all destinations, suggesting {{that the effect of}} foreign-born workers goes beyond a destination-specific informational channel...|$|E

40|$|In the Meiji era, {{charcoal}} production {{developed through}} improvement of Japanese charcoal production technology, {{resulting in the}} export of charcoal to Hong Kong, British India and North America {{in the middle of}} Meiji era （ 1868 - 1912 ）. In the Taisho period （ 1912 - 1926 ）, <b>the</b> <b>export</b> <b>destination</b> of Japan charcoal gradually changed; charcoal was exported to areas such as China, Kwantung leased territory, the Russian Far East, etc. In 1918 the export quantity to China accounted for a majority of the total charcoal export volume. However, after about 1918 Japan began importing charcoal from abroad, especially from China. The amount of Japanese charcoal exported to China declined in only a few years. Japan went from being a country with a surplus in charcoal exports to one with a surplus of charcoal imports, reflecting heightened domestic demand. 　This article uses the publications of the Japanese government and considers the history of Chinese charcoal exported to Japan in the early modern times by referencing to Chinese Maritime Customs Historical Material.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} pricing to market (PTM) {{behaviour}} of Indian exporters during the economic reforms period (1992 - 2005). A PTM {{model has been}} estimated using panel data at the four-digit level of classification for the G 3 and three emerging markets (Brazil, China and South Africa), distinguishing also homogeneous from differentiated goods. Overall, we observe that there is clear evidence of incomplete exchange rate passthrough (ERPT) to buyers ’ currency prices. This degree of ERPT is net {{of changes in the}} level of protection faced by India’s exporters (import tariffs in destination markets), inflation and openness in <b>the</b> <b>export</b> <b>destination</b> market, a macroeconomic policy index partly reflecting changes in exporter’s costs, the share of the exporter in the destination market and the share of the product in the exporter’s total exports. The empirical results indicate that Indian firms do practice PTM and absorb exchange rate changes into their mark-up in G 3 markets, partly owing to tougher competition, but they fully pass-through the exchange rate changes in emerging markets. On the contrary, Indian exporters seem to be taking advantage of trade liberalisation in destination markets by marginall...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between product quality (as indicated by unit value) and export performance, both measured in absolute (per capita) and relative terms, is investigated. Five EU countries (DE, UK, FR, ES, IT), three product categories (cheese, meat preparations and wine), three export destinations (intra EU, extra EU and world) and two time periods (1995 - 1999 and 2000 - 201) are analysed. The estimation {{results show that}} the connection between quality and export performance is positive for Italy, Spain and France but depends on the product category (but not on the period), and differs (but not in all cases) according to <b>the</b> <b>export</b> <b>destination.</b> While the signs of the estimated slope coefficients are stable, the obtained statistical significance levels for these parameters depend on the measure used (relative or absolute) and on the estimation method (OLS or GLS).

The changes in physico-chemical and sensory quality were studied over a period of 24 days.

No reduction (or even an increase) of the strength of the distance effect can be detected for a firm when exporting outside Europe to nearby countries, meaning that European Union firms do not have any particular advantage in exporting their goods in countries near their borders with respect to all the other possible destinations in the world. The ‘repulsive force’ of distance is alleviated only when moving outside of neighbourhoods where the size of the destination market becomes stronger...|$|R

Mark Granovetter’s (1973) discussion of weak and strong ties is used to motivate the proposition that immigrants are well situtated with their knowledge of two societies and their strong ties to their countrymen to lower the transactions costs for prospective exporters, and, hence, that immigrants have a pro-trade effect on exports between their host and origin countries. This proposition (which has been confirmed in several studies {{at the national level}} and for the Canadian provinces) and its several corollaries are tested using state-level trade data averaged over the 1990 – 1992 period.
