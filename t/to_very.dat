5|$|All Russulaceae, {{including}} the corticioid species, are characterised by spherical to elliptic basidiospores {{with a faint}} <b>to</b> <b>very</b> distinct (e.g. warty, spiny, or crested) ornamentation that stains bluish-black with Melzer's reagent (an amyloid stain reaction). Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are usually club-shaped and four-spored. Russulaceae species do not have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{technical}} {{challenges of the}} ion-deposition apparatus was obtaining a sufficiently high ion current (mass deposition rate) while simultaneously decelerating the ions so they could all deposit onto a target electrode embedded in a balance pan. Experiments with gold showed the ions had to be decelerated <b>to</b> <b>very</b> low energies to avoid sputtering effects—a phenomenon whereby ions {{that had already been}} counted ricochet off the target electrode or even dislodged atoms that had already been deposited. The deposited mass fraction in the 2003 German experiments only approached very close to 100% at ion energies of less than around 1eV (<1km/s for gold).|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} arthropods, chelicerates' cuticles would block out {{information}} about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch and vibration sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact <b>to</b> <b>very</b> weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae.|$|E

The Egyptian commando battalion {{in charge of}} Nefisha managed to repel the attack after prolonged, heavy fighting that closed <b>to</b> <b>very</b> short distances. The Israelis lost three tanks, two half-tracks, {{and a large number}} of men. For their part the Sa'iqa at Nefisha lost 24 commandos, including four officers, and 42 wounded, including three officers. Edgar O'Ballance mentions a counterattack by the Sa'iqa which took place during the afternoon and pushed some of Sharon's troops back along the Sweetwater Canal. The Israeli attack had been thoroughly routed.|$|E
5|$|Cape series (Ia) {{diamonds}} have {{a visible}} absorption spectrum (as seen through a direct-vision spectroscope) {{consisting of a}} fine line in the violet at 415.5nm; however, this line is often invisible until the diamond has been cooled <b>to</b> <b>very</b> low temperatures.

5|$|Copper {{is one of}} the few metals {{that occur}} in nature in {{directly}} usable metallic form (native metals) as opposed to needing extraction from an ore.

It was the first metal to be smelted from its ore, c. 5000 BC, the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold, c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal, tin, to create bronze, c. 3500 BC.|$|E

5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other effects as well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence {{of the speed of}} light. If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, then that would allow the presence of an electric field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. This thus allows one to test Coulomb's law <b>to</b> <b>very</b> high precision. A null result of such an experiment has set a limit of m ≲ 10−14eV/c2.|$|E
5|$|In July 2017, a {{study by}} William Sellers et al., {{published}} in the journal PeerJ found that an adult Tyrannosaurus was incapable of running due <b>to</b> <b>very</b> high skeletal loads. The study used the latest computing technology to test its findings. The researchers used two different structural mechanical systems to create the computer model. The weight they settled on for their calculations was a conservative estimate of 7 tons. The model showed that speeds above 11mph (18km/h) would have probably shattered the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus. The finding may mean that running was also not possible for other giant theropod dinosaurs like Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus and Acrocanthosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} and western Africa, the desiccation and humectation {{of the modern}} Sahara desert has led <b>to</b> <b>very</b> fruitful archaeological sites, followed by completely barren soil, only to once again show evidence of population when the aridity of the region was ameliorated. Preservation in these two regions are alternately superb and lamentable, yet the sites that have been uncovered document the adaptive nature of early hominins to climatically unstable environments. Researchers such as Marean and Assefa consider the historic distinction between northern Africa {{and the rest of}} Africa, as though they represent divergent cultural developments, an arbitrary and antiquated distinction.|$|E

5|$|Late on June 3, the IMD {{upgraded}} {{the storm}} <b>to</b> <b>Very</b> Severe Cyclonic Storm Gonu. With warm waters, low amounts of vertical wind shear, and favorable upper-level outflow, Gonu strengthened further to attain peak 1-min sustained winds of 270km/h (165mph) and gusts to 315km/h (195mph), about 285km (175mi) east-southeast of Masirah Island {{on the coast}} of Oman. The IMD upgraded it to Super Cyclonic Storm Gonu late on June 4, with peak 3-min sustained winds reaching 240km/h (150mph) and an estimated pressure of 920mbar. This made it the first super cyclonic storm in the Arabian Sea on record.|$|E

One study reported that the display activity is dependent on light intensity, with the morning display period occurring during the same light intensity level as the afternoon period.|$|E
