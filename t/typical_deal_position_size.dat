40|$|Approximations to utility {{indifference}} {{prices are}} provided for a contingent claim {{in the large}} <b>position</b> <b>size</b> limit. Results are valid for general utility functions on the real line and semi-martingale models. It is shown that as the <b>position</b> <b>size</b> approaches infinity, the utility function's decay rate for large negative wealths is the primary driver of prices. For utilities with exponential decay, one may price like an exponential investor. For utilities with a power decay, one may price like a power investor after a suitable adjustment to {{the rate at which}} the <b>position</b> <b>size</b> becomes large. In a sizable class of diffusion models, limiting indifference prices are explicitly computed for an exponential investor. Furthermore, the large claim limit is seen to endogenously arise as the hedging error for the claim vanishes. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of a technical trading rule, which just provides long and short signals, requires the investor to decide upon the exposure to stake in each trade. Although this <b>position</b> <b>sizing</b> (or money management) crucially affects the risk and return characteristics, recent academic literature has largely ignored this effect, leaving reported results incomparable. This work systematically analyzes the impact of <b>position</b> <b>sizing</b> on timing strategies and clarifies the relation to the Kelly criterion, which proposes to bet relative fractions from the remaining gambling budget. Both erratic as well as different relative positions, i. e. fixed proportions of the remaining portfolio value, are compared for simple moving average trading rules. The simulation of parametrized return series allows systematically varying those asset price properties, which are most in uential on timing results: drift, volatility, and autocorrelation. The study reveals that the introduction of relative <b>position</b> <b>sizing</b> has a severe impact on trading results compared to erratic positions. In contrast to a standard Kelly framework, however, an optimal <b>position</b> <b>size</b> does not exist. Interestingly, smaller trading fractions deliver the highest risk-adjusted returns in most scenarios.

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether a trend following managed futures fund can improve its performance by changing its <b>position</b> <b>sizing</b> method. Trades {{for a simple}} trend following strategy was simulated on 47 futures contracts over the period 1990 - 2012, using varying methods for determining <b>position</b> <b>size.</b> Eleven different <b>position</b> <b>sizing</b> methods where investigated, among them Target Volatility, Omega Optimization and correlation ranking methods. Both methods previously detailed in academic papers as well as novel approaches was implemented, and compared to the baseline performance of the strategy. The {{results from this study}} show that the Target Volatility method, and to some degree Max Drawdown Minimize and Dynamic Stop Lock-In, improved the performance of strategy. The final recommendation for a trend following managed futures fund is to use Target Volatility as <b>position</b> <b>sizing</b> method, possibly in conjunction with Max Drawdown Minimize. Denna studie undersöker huruvida en trendföljande managed futures-fond kan förbättra sina resultat genom att ändra positionsskalningsmetod. Handel med en enkel trendföljande strategi simulerades på 47 futureskontrakt åren 1990 - 2012, för olika metoder att för bestämma positionsstorlek. Elva positionsskalningmetoder undersöktes, exemplevis Target Volatility, Omega Optimization och metoder baserade i korrelationsrankning. Både tidigare beskrivna metoder och nya tillvägagångssätt testades, och jämfördes med den grundläggande strategin med avseende på risk och avkastning. Denna studies resultat visar att framförallt Target Volatility, och i viss uträckning Max Drawdown Minimize och Dynamic Stop Lock-In förbättrade nyckeltalen för den handlade strategin. Den slutgiltiga rekommendationen för en trendföljande managed futures-fond är att använda Target Volatility som positionsskalningsmetod, möjligtvis tillsammans med Max Drawdown Minimize...|$|R

A theory is then described of how such invariant representations may be produced in a hierarchically organized set of visual cortical areas with convergent connectivity. The theory proposes that neurons in these visual areas use a modified Hebb synaptic modification rule with a short-term memory trace to capture whatever can be captured at each stage that is invariant about objects as the object changes in retinal <b>position,</b> <b>size,</b> rotation and view. Simulations are then described which explore the operation of the architecture. The simulations show that such a processing system can build invariant representations of objects.
