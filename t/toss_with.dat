5|$|After Australia {{had been}} bowled out for 249 {{in the first}} innings of the First Test at Trent Bridge, Lindwall's high paced swing yielded 5/57 and cut England down for 144. However, Australia were then bowled out for only 123, leaving England 228 for victory. They were 1/120 with Lindwall wicketless as rain curtailed the match. In the Second Test at Lord's, England had reached 1/177 at stumps {{on the second day}} in reply to Australia's 346. The {{following}} day, Lindwall yorked rising star Tom Graveney and took 5/66 to restrict England to a lead of 26 runs. In Australia's second innings, Lindwall scored the fastest half-century in Ashes history. He took just 48 minutes to reach the mark, with two sixes and five fours. The match was drawn with Lindwall taking 2/26 in the second innings. Lindwall had helped to reduce England to 3/12 at stumps on the fourth day after removing Don Kenyon and Hutton with the new ball, but defiant batting on the final day saved the English. The Third Test was again drawn due to heavy rain, with Lindwall failing to pass double figures in either innings and taking 2/30 in the first innings. Hassett won the toss for the fourth consecutive Test at Headingley and sent England into bat. In front of his home crowd in Yorkshire, Hutton was yorked second ball from a pacy inswinging yorker. Lindwall produced a display of fast and accurate pace bowling, taking 5/54 from 35 overs as England managed only 169. After Australia took a 97 run lead, Lindwall took 3/104 to help leave the tourists with a victory target of 177. This was not before dour English all rounder Trevor Bailey attempted to stone-wall an Australian victory by batting for over four hours for 38 runs. Along with Miller, the pair took 14 wickets between them, displaying their pivotal role in Australia's bowling attack, especially {{in the absence of the}} injured Johnston, who was unavailable for most of the tour. Hutton ordered Bedser and Bailey to bowl leg theory from a long run, sending balls down the leg side to prevent the Australians from scoring. England held on for a draw with Australia 30 runs short when time ran out. The teams met at The Oval for the deciding Test and Australia could manage 275 after winning the <b>toss</b> <b>with</b> Lindwall striking a quickfire 62 noted for an array of off drives to top score and push the total to respectability. Lindwall then took 4/70 but it was not enough to prevent England taking a 31 run lead. Australia collapsed for 162 in the second innings, with the Surrey spin twins of Jim Laker and Tony Lock taking nine wickets between them. This left England 132 to win, something they achieved with eight wickets intact. Lindwall was unable to remove any of the Englishmen.|$|E

25|$|The {{two teams}} {{agreed to meet}} each other in a best-of-seven pre-modern-era World Series, with the winner taking all the prize money. It was the second {{straight}} year that the Browns and White Stockings met in the World Series. The six games of the series were played on six consecutive days. The first three games were scheduled for Chicago, with the next three games to be held in St. Louis. A decisive seventh game, if necessary, was to be held in a neutral site. The location of the rubber game in the match was to be determined by coin <b>toss,</b> <b>with</b> each franchise owner selecting a city for the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{match was}} widely {{anticipated}} {{and had a}} huge leadup. Pakistani captain Wasim Akram withdrew due to injury. India elected to bat after winning the <b>toss,</b> <b>with</b> Sidhu (93 from 115 balls, 11 fours) and Tendulkar (31 off 59 balls, 3 fours) reaching 90 before Tendulkar was dismissed by Pakistan fast bowler Ata-ur-Rehman. Although wickets fell regularly, with all Pakistani bowlers barring part-timer Salim Malik among the wickets, the Indians continued to score quickly, with Jadeja making a rapid 45 from 25 balls in the final overs, including 40 from Waqar Younis' last two overs. India scored 287/8 in their 50 overs. Prasad and Kumble then took three wickets each to restrict Pakistan to 248/9, despite their strong start due to a quick 55 from Pakistan's stand-in-captain and opener Aamer Sohail, to complete a memorable victory and qualify for the semifinals, making it 2 wins in 2 World Cup matches against the arch-rivals. This resulted in widespread disappointment in Pakistan, leading to a government inquiry, crowd demonstrations outside players' homes and the suicide of one distraught fan.|$|E
25|$|Crouch {{made his}} debut for the Surrey Second XI against Cambridgeshire in the 1933 Minor Counties Championship. He made {{thirteen}} further appearances for the Surrey Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship, {{the last of}} which came against the Gloucestershire Second XI in 1939. Playing minor counties cricket for the Surrey Second XI allowed him to be selected for a combined Minor Counties cricket team in 1935, making two first-class appearances against Oxford University at the University Parks and the touring South Africans at Richmond Drive, Skegness. Against Oxford University, the Minor Counties lost the <b>toss,</b> <b>with</b> Oxford University electing to bat first. In a match heavily curtailed due to rain, Oxford University reached 169/4 in their first-innings, with Crouch bowling ten overs for 34 runs and taking the wicket of John Halliday. This was the only innings during the match, which subsequently ended as a draw. In his second appearance against the South Africans, the tourists won the toss and elected to bat first, compiling 394 all out, with Crouch taking the wicket of top-scorer Ken Viljoen for 168, to finish with figures of 1/67 from sixteen overs. The Minor Counties responded in their first-innings by making 190 all out, with Crouch being dismissed for a duck by Arthur Langton. Forced to follow-on in their second-innings, the Minor Counties were dismissed for 224, with Crouch being dismissed for 7 runs by Langton. The South Africans won the match by 10 wickets.|$|E

25|$|England had a {{good time}} between the Fourth and Fifth Tests. Mike Denness {{returned}} to form with 157 not in their innings victory over Tasmania and 99 in a 187 run win over New South Wales. Dennis Amiss made 52 and 124 in the Sydney game and Chris Old took 7/59. Denness therefore returned to the team as England captain, replacing the injured vice-captain John Edrich who was still recovering from his damaged ribs, which had in fact been broken, not just bruised as previously thought. Australia dropped the batsman Ross Edwards in favour of the local leg-spinner Terry Jenner. There was a storm the night before the first day, which ripped the covers off the field and flooded the ground. The nightwatchman had not called the curator, so the damage could not be repaired in time for the first day's play, which had to be abandoned. The ex-Australian umpire Col Egar thought that play might not even start on the second day. What made it more distressing was that a record crowd appeared despite the series having already been won, but had to be turned away. Jim Laker and Ken Barrington were part of the crowd, escorting travel groups of British cricket fans. As it was there was a steady wind which helped dry out the ground overnight, except at the River Torrens end, but the famously long boundary was pulled in with ropes marking a now egg shaped Adelaide Oval. Denness called heads {{and for the first time}} England won the <b>toss.</b> <b>With</b> the pitch still worse for wear he chose to field, the third time the winning captain had taken this unusual course in the series.|$|E
500|$|On November 10, 2010, the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) {{unveiled}} a new format for selecting the NHL All-Star teams: the traditional conference format {{was replaced by}} a [...] "fantasy draft." [...] Fans voted for six players, from either conference (three forwards, two defencemen and one goaltender), and the NHL selected another 36 players, for a total of 42 players. The chosen players then appointed two captains; the NHL and NHLPA, with input from the players, named two alternate captains for each team. Each team had two forwards and one defenceman as its captain and alternates. The captains and alternates selected their team members in a fantasy-style draft held on January 28, 2011. The first pick was determined by a coin <b>toss,</b> <b>with</b> alternating picks after the first. Teams consisted of three goaltenders, six defencemen and 12 forwards. Although the draft rules did not dictate a strict order in which positions had to be filled, to guarantee the final picks were not constrained by having to satisfy roster composition rules, the teams' three goaltenders had to be chosen by the end of round ten, and all defencemen had to be chosen by the end of round 15. According to NHL Vice President of Hockey and Business Development Brendan Shanahan, the new format was introduced to add excitement and intrigue into all the events, while make it more fun for everyone involved.|$|E

New Zealand won the <b>toss,</b> <b>with</b> captain Maia Lewis {{choosing}} to bat first. New Zealand began poorly, losing Emily Drumm, Shelley Fruin and Katrina Keenan for six, eight and five respectively, reaching 49/3. Debbie Hockley, New Zealand's opener, scored 79 (48%) of her team score, as New Zealand eventually reached 164 all out from 49.3 overs. Hockley {{was one of only}} three New Zealand players to score in double figures, captain Lewis and wicket-keeper Rebecca Rolls scoring 10 and 18 respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The Phoenix Suns {{were the}} first major sports team in Phoenix, being granted a National Basketball Association (NBA) {{franchise}} in 1968.

[...] The team initially played their home games at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum in downtown Phoenix. Their last place finish in their inaugural season made them eligible for a coin <b>toss</b> <b>with</b> the Milwaukee Bucks to see who would get the first pick in the draft, {{which was to be}} Lew Alcindor (who later changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). The Suns lost the flip, and the two teams went in different directions for the next 8 years. The Suns would not make their first appearance in the NBA finals until 1976, losing to the Boston Celtics in six games.|$|E
