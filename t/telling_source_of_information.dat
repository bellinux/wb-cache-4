30|$|The {{independent}} variables are farm-specific and other institutional factors. Farmer-specific variables are farming experience in years (EXP), farmer’s education (EDN), and his household size (HS) in numbers. Educational status variable (EDN) is defined differently by using different specifications as (i) first, {{years of schooling}} of household head; (ii) second, the average years of education of the household; and (iii) third, two dummy variables defined as 5  years of schooling or more and 10  years of schooling or more. The first dummy variable takes the value 1 if the head’s education is of 5  years of schooling or more and 0 otherwise. The second dummy variable takes the value 1 if it is 10  years of schooling or more and 0 otherwise. 9 The reason for taking 5 and 10  years of schooling spawns from the argument that in a basic education cycle, 5  years of schooling is considered as minimum education level as it completes primary education, and 10  years of schooling completes the secondary level of education or high school education in India. 10 All these specifications of education (EDN) variable are hypothesized to have positive impact on adoption. There is a significant mean difference {{in the level of}} education between adopters and non-adopters. The farm-specific factors include total paddy area (ARPDY) in hectare, soil quality (SQ), and total cost of hired labour (TLC) in thousand rupees and ecosystem dummy (ECDMY). We hypothesized a positive relation between these farm-specific factors and adoption. The mean values of total paddy area (ARPDY) vary significantly in-between adopters and non-adopters of MVs. The set of institutional variables includes social capital (SOC), tenancy structure (TNCY), access to credit (CRDIT), extension visits dummy (EXTN), ownership of livestock (LIVSTCK), distance to market (MKTD), and access to media dummy (MEDIA). The tenancy structure is constructed as the proportion of leased-in operated area in total operational landholding. In our study region, generally, some farmers leased in some lands from other relatively big farmers who are either staying away from villages or not doing cultivation since their main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> livelihood is non-farm activities. So, this is not sharecropping where a farmer allies with another farmer. Similarly, we have constructed the dummy variable “MEDIA” as the one that takes value 1 if a farmer owns a television and 0 otherwise. In the existing literature, many studies have taken a radio or both radio and television. But, intuition <b>tells</b> that audiovisual <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is more effective than only audio. The set of technology characteristic-related variables includes farmer’s perception about the maturity period of the crop (MATC), higher productivity characteristic (PRDTYC), and the availability of seeds at a cheaper price (CHEPSC). All these technology characteristics related variables are dummy variables taking the value 1 if the farmer perceives so about the MVs and 0 if not.|$|R

One study on long term RP showed that risk assessment after receiving risk-related information was in part mediated by heuristic and systematic information processing. Here, highly credible sources were associated with more heuristic information processing and lower perceived risk. In turn, low credibility <b>of</b> an <b>information</b> <b>source</b> is associated with more systematic information processing and higher perceived risk. If the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> was an industry or government organization, higher credibility was correlated with lower perceived risk scores in this study. If the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> was another person, however, this correlation was inverted (Trumbo and McComas 2003).
