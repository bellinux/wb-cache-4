5|$|Silent Hill: Shattered Memories divides its {{gameplay}} {{between two}} different settings. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>section</b> {{is set in}} a psychotherapist's office and the second in a town called Silent Hill.

The player responds to Kaufmann's questions and completes a psychological test, fills in a questionnaire or colors pictures. The player's responses to these tests alters aspects of gameplay in the second setting, including the available areas, the physical appearance and behavior of characters encountered, and the physical appearance of the monsters. Shattered Memories returns to Kaufmann's office periodically throughout the game.|$|E
30|$|As expected, {{the lowest}} speeds for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>sections</b> are {{presented}} {{at the end of}} the simulation time because only the “emer” and slow vehicles are presented.

This concentration of the slower vehicles {{at the end of the}} simulation occurs only for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>sections,</b> because after node 14, all “emer” vehicles have increased their SOC over the “charge” threshold, changing their status. In both analyzed scenarios, the average speeds of the traffic flow exceed 30  km/h.|$|R

As the Istrian Y system was being developed, the E751 designation was gradually transferred to the new route, with consistent signposting of the E751 along the A9 and the A8, just as the D3 state road designation west of Rijeka was transferred to the B8 and B9 (later replaced by the A8 and A9 respectively).|$|E
