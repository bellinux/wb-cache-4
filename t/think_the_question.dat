6000|$|... "Technical education," [...] in {{the sense}} in which the term is ordinarily used, and in which I am now {{employing}} it, means that sort of education which is specially adapted to the needs of men whose business in life it is to pursue some kind of handicraft; it is, in fact, a fine Greco-Latin equivalent for what in good vernacular English would be called [...] "the teaching of handicrafts." [...] And probably, at this stage of our progress, it may occur to many of you to think of the story of the cobbler and his last, and to say to yourselves, though you will be too polite to put the question openly to me, What does the speaker know practically about this matter? What is his handicraft? I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is a very proper one, and unless I were prepared to answer it, I hope satisfactorily, I should have chosen some other theme.|$|E
6000|$|Therefore, whoever thinks fit {{to revive}} that baffled question, [...] "Why was the late {{ministry}} changed?"

Though after all, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> as trifling {{as that of the}} Papists, when they ask us, [...] "where was our religion before Luther?" [...] And indeed, the ministry was changed {{for the same reason that}} religion was reformed, because a thousand corruptions had crept into the discipline and doctrine of the state, by the pride, the avarice, the fraud, and the ambition of those who administered to us in secular affairs.|$|E

However, as Dr. Wace can find no difficulty in pointing out the passage of M.

Renan were to retract and do penance in Notre-Dame to-morrow for any contributions to Biblical criticism that may be specially his property, the main results of that criticism, as they are set forth in the works of Strauss, Baur, Reuss, and Volkmar, for example, would not be sensibly affected.|$|E
60|$|In {{reference}} to Bruce Castle school, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> set at rest most probably {{by the fact}} of there being no vacancy (it is always full) until Christmas, when Howitt's two boys and Jerrold's one go in and fill it up again. But after going carefully through the school, a question would arise in my mind whether the system--a perfectly admirable one; the only recognition of education as a broad system of moral and intellectual philosophy, that I have ever seen in practice--do not require so much preparation and progress {{in the mind of}} the boy, as that he shall have come there younger and less advanced than Willy; or at all events without that very different sort of school experience which he must have acquired at Brighton. I have no warrant for this doubt, beyond a vague uneasiness suggesting a suspicion of its great probability. On such slight ground I would not hint it to anyone but you, who I know will give it its due weight, and no more and no less.|$|E

60|$|But {{there are}} some people, nevertheless--and I am one of them--who think that the most {{practical}} and important thing about a man is still {{his view of the}} universe. We think that for a landlady considering a lodger, {{it is important to know}} his income, but still more important to know his philosophy. We think that for a general about to fight an enemy, it is important to know the enemy's numbers, but still more important to know the enemy's philosophy. We <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is not whether the theory of the cosmos affects matters, but whether in the long run, anything else affects them. In the fifteenth century men cross-examined and tormented a man because he preached some immoral attitude; in the nineteenth century we feted and flattered Oscar Wilde because he preached such an attitude, and then broke his heart in penal servitude because he carried it out. It may be a question which of the two methods was the more cruel; there can be no kind of question which was the more ludicrous. The age of the Inquisition has not at least the disgrace of having produced a society which made an idol of the very same man for preaching the very same things which it made him a convict for practising.|$|E
6000|$|Some people {{objected to}} spiritualism, table rappings, and such things, {{because they were}} undignified, because the ghosts cracked jokes or waltzed with dinner-tables. I do not share this {{objection}} in the least. I wish the spirits were more farcical than they are. That they should make more jokes and better ones, would be my suggestion. For almost all the spiritualism of our time, {{in so far as}} it is new, is solemn and sad. Some Pagan gods were lawless, and some Christian saints were a little too serious; but the spirits of modern spiritualism are both lawless and serious--a disgusting combination. The specially contemporary spirits are not only devils, they are blue devils. This is, first and last, the real value of Christmas; in so far as the mythology remains at all {{it is a kind of}} happy mythology. Personally, of course, I believe in Santa Claus; but it is the season of forgiveness, and I will forgive others for not doing so. But if there is anyone who does not comprehend the defect in our world which I am civilising, I should recommend him, for instance, to read a story by Mr. Henry James, called [...] "The Turn of the Screw." [...] It is one of the most powerful things ever written, and it is one of the things about which I doubt most whether it ought ever to have been written at all. It describes two innocent children gradually growing at once omniscient and half-witted under the influence of the foul ghosts of a groom and a governess. As I say, I doubt whether Mr. Henry James ought to have published it (no, it is not indecent, do not buy it; it is a spiritual matter), but I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> so doubtful that I will give that truly great man a chance. I will approve the thing as well as admire it if he will write another tale just as powerful about two children and Santa Claus. If he will not, or cannot, then the conclusion is clear; we can deal strongly with gloomy mystery, but not with happy mystery; we are not rationalists, but diabolists.|$|E
6000|$|Nineteen answers {{have been}} received. One is [...] "5," [...] but, as no working is given with it, it must, in {{accordance}} with the rule, remain [...] "a deed without a name." [...] JANET makes it [...] "35 and 7/10ths." [...] I am sorry she has misunderstood the question, and has supposed that those who had lost an ear were 75 per cent. of those who had lost an eye; and so on. Of course, on this supposition, the percentages must all be multiplied together. This she has done correctly, but I can give her no honours, as I do not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> will fairly bear her interpretation, THREE SCORE AND TEN makes it [...] "19 and 3/8ths." [...] Her solution has given me--I will not say [...] "many anxious days and sleepless nights," [...] for I wish to be strictly truthful, but--some trouble in making any sense at all of it. She makes the number of [...] "pensioners wounded once" [...] to be 310 ("per cent.," [...] I suppose!): dividing by 4, she gets 77 and a half as [...] "average percentage:" [...] again dividing by 4, she gets 19 and 3/8ths as [...] "percentage wounded four times." [...] Does she suppose wounds of different kinds to [...] "absorb" [...] each other, so to speak? Then, no doubt, the data are equivalent to 77 pensioners with one wound each, and a half-pensioner with a half-wound. And does she then suppose these concentrated wounds to be transferable, so that 3/4ths of these unfortunates can obtain perfect health by handing over their wounds to the remaining 1/4th? Granting these suppositions, her answer is right; or rather, if the question had been [...] "A road is covered with one inch of gravel, along 77 and a half per cent. of it. How much of it could be covered 4 inches deep with the same material?" [...] her answer would have been right. But alas, that wasn't the question! DELTA makes some most amazing assumptions: [...] "let every one who has not lost an eye have lost an ear," [...] "let every one who has not lost both eyes and ears have lost an arm." [...] Her ideas of a battle-field are grim indeed. Fancy a warrior who would continue fighting after losing both eyes, both ears, and both arms! This is a case which she (or [...] "it?") evidently considers possible.|$|E
