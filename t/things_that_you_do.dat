It is information, beliefs, and customs handed down {{by word of}} mouth or by example from one generation to another without written instruction. Our military traditions are really the [...] "Army Way" [...] of doing and thinking. An interesting thing about traditions is that many of our Army traditions started out as something quite different from what they are now.:4-26. Military tradition is an interesting and often amusing subject. It gives a Soldier a feeling of pride to understand just why we do things the way we do. Traditions are expressed in the things we do, the uniform we wear, and the things we say. Many of the words we use in the Army are unique and have been added to our vocabulary from {{different parts of the world}} and at different times in history.:4-27. Army traditions are the things that everyone in the Army does, everywhere. Unit traditions are the unique <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> in your unit that other units may or may not do. Some unit traditions are—:*Ceremonial duties. Soldiers of the Old Guard, the 3d U.S. Infantry, have been Sentinels of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier since 1948. :*The green berets of the Army's Special Forces. :*Airborne units’ maroon beret. :*Cavalry units’ spurs and hats. added:*Special designations (authorized unit nicknames) such as Cottonbalers, the 7th Infantry Regiment. :*Distinctive items of clothing worn in your unit such as headgear, belt buckles, and tankers' boots. :*The promotion party. :*Unit mottoes such as [...] "Victory!" [...] or [...] "Send me!" [...] :*"Hooah!" [...] This informal but always understood sound is less a word than an audible affirmation of the warrior ethos. The Soldier that utters that sound understands his task and will not quit until it is completed. That sound means Soldiers are ready and willing to accomplish the mission at hand.|$|E
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to offer a response full of fireworks to a paper with which one agrees wholeheartedly, so I hope this will do justice to David Cohen’s stimulating analysis of women in Athenian public life. Cohen has opened up important issues in two areas which have significant implications {{not only for the}} study of gender in ancient Athens, but also for our overall understanding of civic life: 1) the representation of citizenship in public life and 2) civic religion as a significant, gendered public arena. 1. Citizenship and representation. It is good to see that we can finally move beyond {{the question of whether or}} not women were citizens, to conclude that women could not have been anything other than citizens (Patterson 1981; 1986). This is not to deny that citizenship meant something different for women than for men, as it also must have meant something different for rich men than for poor men. Cohen has demonstrated the importance of representing yourself as a ‘citizen ’ in terms of lifestyle and everyday behaviour: the way you look and act, the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> (including your occupation) and even the things that you wear.

When I got back here I found a letter from you. Gee it was swell. I’ve read it about eight times already. I miss you SO much darling, and it’s only been about four hours since I last saw you. I[t] seemed funny to put you on a train for a change. Say what’s this about you losing your job? I guess since you didn’t say anything about it this weekend it’s O. K. now, n’est ce pas? Honey, try to wear your hair up next weekend, please. Then we can go to New York and be glamorous. I’ll bet you look nice when you get up in the morning. I’m serious now, no kidding. Remember this morning around six o’clock? You didn’t have any makeup on and you were very groggy and sleepy, and you had just brushed your hair—You looked wonderful. You know darling, you’re very pretty. This was a nice weekend. I {{thought it was going to}} be a stinker about ten Saturday night. I was in an awful mood, honey. Whenever you see I’m in a mood like that darling, just turn your head so I can see your eyes, or smile in the wonderful way that you do, or, oh I could name a thousand other things about you that are a sure cure, things that I love, the small things that add so much to my love toward you. You know, hon, we seem to have the same moods together. That’s good. You’re just perfect, honey, too perfect to be true. But—who was it that you kissed goodnight on the first night you went out with him? Huh? We did do a lot of talking this weekend didn’t we, or at least I did. Maybe I said too much, but I believe in being frank, and not keeping anything from each other, and I know you do. I’d much rather have me tell you now about my—er—should I say escapades, than someone else later. God, I wish this war was over too, darling, I think it will take at least two years to finish this job. It’s going to be a long, tough, filthy fight, angel, but it will be worth it, for we’re fighting for freedom, this wonderful country, for people like you and your family, and our happiness. Darling, it will be worth it. And honey, you’re helping the war effort, not only by buying bonds as you do, but by the seemingly unimportant <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> like sending packages overseas, or writing to fellas over there. Keep it up honey, and that will be your contribution, one of the best. Oh, and by the way, you do a lot to keep up the morale of one certain very important member of our Air Corps, and I don’t mean “Hap” Arnold, (or do you write to him too). By the way, I love you. And remind me to remind you to tell me how wonderful I am. Well hon, I kinda fell [sic] like it’s going to snow tomorrow, so I guess we’ll have good weather and fly all day. I’ll be thinking of you always (I like that word, now.) That would be a good song for us honey. Do you like “always”? It would be very appropriate ‘cause I know “I’ll be loving you,—always” my darling. Give my love to your mother. Did I say goodby [sic] to her today. I can’t remember. I love you darling, and miss you more than ever. Steve sends Woody his love. And I send you mine, angel. Goodnight Sweetheart. As everJudd[Transcription ends...|$|E
40|$|Cue: Kenya is {{a country}} {{well-known}} for its livestock keeping. Recently however, {{some have argued that}} the nature of livestock keeping in Kenya needs to change, in order to increase the economic benefit to the country. Central to this idea is the need to export more animals and animal products to foreign markets, where Kenyan exports can earn good prices. But if a country is serious about selling livestock to foreign markets, achieving the highest standards of animal health is critically important. Where health standards are low, outbreaks of infectious diseases such as Foot and Mouth disease can easily occur, leading to bans on all animal movements and the closing of borders to livestock trade. But how can costly disease outbreaks be stopped? To find out, Eric Kadenge spoke to Dr David Ikiror, an animal health scientist working in Kenya. IN: 		?Just like human beings? OUT:		? reap the maximum benefits. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 05 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr David Ikiror, emphasising how good livestock health can bring substantial economic benefits. Transcript Ikiror	Just like human beings, we need to be healthy in order to be productive. So for you {{to be able to get}} the optimal production and productivity from your livestock, surely you have to keep your livestock healthy otherwise the feeding and the other <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> alone will not be enough. And also of course, if you keep your livestock healthy, then also you can access markets. Kadenge	Now that is very very interesting and I would like to go ahead and find out - what are some of the ways that we can prevent our animals from getting sick? Ikiror	We all know that proper feeding is very very important in maintaining human health. The same thing applies to animals. They need to get a balanced diet: proteins, they need to get vitamins, they need to get energy, they need to get water, mineral salts, they are all very necessary to keep our animals healthy. Also we need to, just like for human beings, we need to talk of hygiene. We need to have a clean environment where our animals stay. In other words, if an animal is kept like in a zero grazing unit, you need to be cleaning the place - removing the dung, removing the urine - to make sure that the environment is clean. And of course even the housing is important especially for young animals. They should be housed in such a way that you protect them from excesses of weather, like excessive wind, which can predispose them to pneumonia or also rainfall. We need to make sure that our animals are protected from pests. We are talking of things like ticks, so we need to dip our animals regularly. We need to make sure that our animals also are de-wormed; de-worm them regularly to lower the worm burden. We need to make sure that also our animals are vaccinated against some - there are some diseases which can be protected through vaccination. So those are some of the ways in which we can keep our animals healthy. Kadenge	And for the sake of maybe a farmer or a livestock trader as you said - that would like to be able to maybe identify when his livestock has a disease, are there some common things that one can probably notice that will indicate that an animal is unhealthy? Ikiror	We can talk of somebody knowing the signs of a healthy animal. A healthy animal will usually show a smooth hair coat, smooth skin, it will be active and the eyes will not be tearing. If it is an animal with a tail - the tail will be moving continuously, it will be walking normally. If the urine is passed, it will be normal urine. The dung also it will be normal - normal colour, normal consistency. Then if it is an animal that?s for example producing milk - if it is a cow or a goat which is milking then the milk will be normal, of normal colour and consistency. And also if you look at this animal on the body, you will not see any sign of parasites for example. That is a sign of an animal that is healthy. So in other words, the normal things that you would expect a normal animal to have. Kadenge	Is there anything else that you would like to add? Ikiror	What I would like to add is to say that basically, livestock is now being identified as one of the important engines that will spur economic development. In fact if we talk about the recovery of the economy, livestock is being earmarked as one of the main drivers. And it is being seen not only producing food for our consumption but we are also thinking in terms of producing these animal products and also animals themselves for the export markets. And as a farmer it will be very very necessary for us to double our efforts and even improving our livestock and also its important not only to look at the health but let?s look at the kind of breeds that we keep in our area. That?s why I am saying that it is important that we seek advice from experts so that we can get advice on which animals to keep in which particular area and on the general management. The important thing is we should move away from subsistence form of livestock production to more market oriented. That way as farmers and as a nation we can reap the maximum benefits. End of track. Dr David Ikiror, an animal health scientist working in Kenya describes the basic principles of good livestock health and argues t hat livestock farmers must become more market oriented...|$|E
