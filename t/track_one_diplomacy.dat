50|$|One of the {{successful}} track two dialogue processes can be the Oslo Accords of 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization(PLO), which achieved some remarkable breakthroughs in the Israeli-Palestinian relationship. The contacts began as a track two diplomacy, with an unofficial initiative by a Norwegian scholar, but had transitioned into <b>track</b> <b>one</b> <b>diplomacy</b> {{by the time it}} was finished, finalized with a handshake between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO head Yasser Arafat on the White House lawn.|$|E
5000|$|In 1981, Joseph V. Montville, then a U.S. State Department employee, {{coined the}} phrases Track One and Track Two {{diplomacy}} in [...] "Foreign Policy According to Freud", {{which appeared in}} Foreign Policy (Davidson & Montville, 1981). <b>Track</b> <b>One</b> <b>diplomacy</b> was what diplomats did—formal negotiations between nations conducted by professional diplomats. Track Two diplomacy referred to conflict resolution efforts by professional non-governmental conflict resolution practitioners and theorists. [...] "Track Two has as its object the reduction or resolution of conflict, within a country or between countries, by lowering the anger or tension or fear that exists, through improved communication and {{a better understanding of}} each other's point of view".|$|E
5000|$|Track two {{diplomacy}} is unofficial, non-structured interaction. It is always open minded, often altruistic, and ... strategically optimistic, based on best case analysis. Its underlying {{assumption is that}} actual or potential conflict can be resolved or eased by appealing to common human capabilities to respond to good will and reasonableness. Scientific and cultural exchanges are examples of track two diplomacy. The problem most political liberals fail to recognize is that reasonable and altruistic interaction with foreign countries cannot be an alternative to traditional <b>track</b> <b>one</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> with its official posturing and its underlying threat {{of the use of}} force. Both tracks are necessary for psychological reasons and both need each other.|$|E

5000|$|This track list {{is in fact}} incorrect, as [...] "The Movie" [...] is <b>track</b> <b>one,</b> [...] "Sargent Drexell Theme" [...] is only {{included}} as part of <b>track</b> <b>one,</b> {{and there is an}} unlisted CD-bonus track ("New Song") as track eight.|$|R
5000|$|Track II {{diplomacy}} is {{the practice of}} [...] "non-governmental, informal and unofficial contacts and activities between private citizens or groups of individuals, sometimes called 'non-state actors'". It contrasts with track I diplomacy, which {{can be defined as}} official, governmental diplomacy that occur inside official government channels. However, track two {{diplomacy is}} not a substitute for <b>track</b> <b>one</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> Rather, it is there to assist official actors to manage and resolve conflicts by exploring possible solutions derived from the public view and without the requirements of formal negotiation or bargaining for advantage. In addition, the term track 1.5 diplomacy is used by some analysts to define a situation where official and non-official actors cooperate in conflict resolution.|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} two decades, {{non-governmental}} organisations (NGOs) have played an increasingly prominent role in progressive social change throughout the world. In three recent centres of political conflict, Northern Ireland, South Africa and Israel/Palestine, a diverse array of peace/conflict resolution organisations (P/CROs) were involved to some degree within the political process, prior to, during and after, the establishment of major peace agreements and ceasefires. To date, the academic literature on these conflicts has concentrated on the elite-level, <b>Track</b> <b>One</b> <b>diplomacy</b> and the struggle between the parties, with little attention being given to the equally important community-based Track Two initiatives, that are essential to building and sustaining peace processes. This article will present new empirical evidence to redress this imbalance. It has two inter-connecting sections. The first {{will argue that the}} P/CRO sector has, in different ways (and with varying success) made an important contribution to the peace processes in the three regions. The second section will present new evidence to show that within Northern Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement of 10 April 1998 ' was organically linked to P/CRO activity since 1969, in terms of both the personalities and the political debate that surrounded the peace process...|$|E
40|$|International {{mediation}} is not conducted {{solely by}} official actors such as states or international organizations. Non-official parties such {{as individuals and}} non-governmental organizations increasingly intervene as third-party mediators in conflicts. Both official and unofficial interventions are conceptualized as tracks of diplomacy (ToDs). Even {{though there is a}} vast quantitative literature on international mediation, most studies focusing on ToDs have been qualitative and produced few generalizable insights. This article extends the existing literature on third-party intervention by developing a theoretical model to explain the effectiveness of different ToDs, which is then empirically tested in a first large-N study. The findings indicate that the leverage and resources of ToDs determine outcome effectiveness. <b>Track</b> <b>One</b> <b>Diplomacy,</b> that is, efforts by official actors, tends to be the most effective form of intervention as greater leverage and more resources invested can make track intervention more effective. It is also found that combined mediation efforts of both official and unofficial tracks can be more effective than independent track actions. Since conflicts with mediation are unlikely to be a randomly selected set, a selection estimator is used to test the hypotheses on effectiveness. The empirical findings support the theory and demonstrate that the specific type of mediating actor seems highly important. © The Author(s) 2010...|$|E
