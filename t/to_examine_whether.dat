5|$|In {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} France during the Napoleonic Wars, Lieutenant Colonel John Brown surveyed the castle in 1804 <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>whether</b> the central keep could be turned into a Martello tower, a type of circular gun tower popular during this period. The scheme was not taken forward, although the defences of the surrounding coast line were much improved by the government. The painter J. M. W. Turner visited between 1805 and 1807 during the middle of this work, later depicting the castle in landscape paintings and sketches of the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal {{expanded}} the scope of judicial review by adopting an objective test when reviewing the exercise of executive discretion. In contrast to the subjective test, the objective test permits the court <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>whether</b> the decision-maker's satisfaction was based on objective facts which fell {{within the scope of}} the purposes specified by the ISA. The subjective satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient. However, the adoption of this objective test was only part of the obiter dicta of the case. The ratio decidendi of the case was based on narrower technical grounds.|$|E

It responded with an intensive lobbying campaign directed at members of the United States government. The Cold War had also predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. The CIA started to explore the notion of lending support to detractors and opponents of Árbenz. Walter Bedell Smith, the Director of Central Intelligence, ordered J. C.

The results illustrate that lower corruption is associated with higher savings, and the effect of corruption on savings decreases with income level. The results suggest that government in ECOWAS should employ effective policies that will reduce corruption to raise saving, and raise incomes to reduce the negative effect of corruption on savings...|$|R

5|$|Thom wished <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>whether</b> or not prehistoric peoples used high-accuracy astronomy. He {{believed}} that by using horizon astronomy, observers could make estimates of dates {{in the year}} to a specific day. The observation required finding a place where on a specific date the sun set into a notch on the horizon. A common theme is a mountain which blocked the Sun, but on the right day would allow the tiniest fraction to re-emerge {{on the other side}} for a 'double sunset'. The animation below shows two sunsets at a hypothetical site, one the day before the summer solstice and one at the summer solstice, which has a double sunset.|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} view {{concerning the}} impact of export instability on the domestic economies of developing countries is one of pessimism. Export instability is thought to adversely affect the short‐run stability and longer‐run growth of income. Empirical evidence on these matters is, however, inconclusive. This article applies a Granger/Sims reduced form approach <b>to</b> <b>examining</b> <b>whether</b> export instability generates short‐run instability in domestic income. For each of a sample of 20 trade‐dependent countries the results obtained strongly support the contention that export instability induces short‐run macroeconomic instability...|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{both state}} and federal appellate courts are usually {{restricted}} <b>to</b> <b>examining</b> <b>whether</b> the lower court made the correct legal determinations, rather than hearing direct evidence and determining what {{the facts of the}} case were. Furthermore, U.S. appellate courts are usually restricted to hearing appeals based on matters that were originally brought up before the trial court. Hence, such an appellate court will not consider an appellant's argument if it is based on a theory that is raised for the first time in the appeal.|$|R

25|$|A {{few days}} after Comey's dismissal, the FBI {{reportedly}} widened its investigation <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>whether</b> President Trump attempted to obstruct justice. Many FBI insiders believed the real reason Comey was fired was because he had refused to end the investigation into Russian connections to the election. In his June testimony Comey said that Trump never asked him to stop the Russia investigation. The special counsel's office took over the investigation. ABC News later clarified that the special counsel is gathering preliminary information about possible obstruction of justice, but a full-scale investigation {{has not yet been}} launched.|$|E

What is known is that new media has {{had a significant impact}} on elections and what began in the 2008 presidential campaign established new standards for how campaigns would be run. Since then, campaigns also have their outreach methods by developing targeted messages for specific audiences that can be reached via different social media platforms. Both parties have specific digital media strategies designed for voter outreach.|$|E

50|$|To {{accomplish}} this goal, Kant {{argued that it}} would be necessary to use synthetic reasoning. However, this posed a new problem—how is it possible to have synthetic knowledge that is not based on empirical observation—that is, how are synthetic a priori truths possible? This question is exceedingly important, Kant maintains, because he contended that all important metaphysical knowledge is of synthetic a priori propositions. If it is impossible to determine which synthetic a priori propositions are true, he argues, then metaphysics as a discipline is impossible. The remainder of the Critique of Pure Reason is devoted <b>to</b> <b>examining</b> <b>whether</b> and how knowledge of synthetic a priori propositions is possible.|$|R

In the paper, the researchers alternated between specific conditions <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>whether</b> or not the behavior occurred under specific environmental conditions. Through direct manipulation of the environment, the researchers could accurately identify the controlling variables of the aberrant behavior, and provide interventions that targeted the functional relationship between the behavior and the environment. Since this seminal article was published, {{a wide range of}} research has been published in the area of functional analyses of aberrant behaviors. The methodology has since become the gold standard in assessment and treatment of aberrant behaviors.|$|E

25|$|Larsen {{mentions}} {{ways that}} a business could change its operations {{in order to}} fight {{the negative effects of}} social loafing. For one, research has shown that if each employee has their performance individually measured, they will put in more effort than if it was not measured. Another person interested in the idea of social loafing is Kenneth Price, from The University of Texas. Price conducted a social loafing experiment in order <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>whether</b> two key factors that he suspected {{played a role in the}} way social loafing arose in work groups. These two factors were dispensability and fairness. The experiment that he conducted involved 514 people that were divided into 144 teams that were set to meet for fourteen weeks. The projects assigned to these people were very complex and called for diverse skills from many different individuals in order to be fully completed. The experiments findings did in fact corroborate Price's suspicions in the two factors of dispensability and fairness.|$|E

25|$|One of ATSDR’s primary {{responsibilities}} {{is conducting}} public health assessments and health consultations. The agency conducts public health assessments for all current or proposed {{sites on the}} National Priorities List (commonly known as Superfund sites). The purpose of public health assessments is <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>whether</b> hazardous substances at a site pose a human health hazard and to issue recommendations about limiting or stopping exposure to those substances. ATSDR also conducts health consultations, often in response to requests from EPA {{and state and local}} agencies. Health consultations examine specific health questions, such as the health effects of exposure to a specific chemical at a site. Health consultations are more limited in scope than public health assessments. ATSDR also conducts public health assessments and health consultations in response to petitions from members of the public. To conduct public health assessments and health consultations, ATSDR relies on its own scientists or establishes cooperative agreements with states, providing technical assistance to state health departments. ATSDR issued more than 200 public health assessments in 2009 and provides about 1,000 health consultations each year.|$|E
