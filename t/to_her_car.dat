5|$|While at the discothèque, De Simone and Savage were {{together}} throughout the evening, and DeSimone did not consume any alcoholic drinks. They left the night club together, and Savage drove DeSimone {{back to the}} Tom Tackle car park, arriving sometime between 00:30 and 01:00 (12:30 and 1:00a.m.) on 5December. Savage testified that she drove into the covered parking area and that they sat chatting {{for a while before}} DeSimone made the short walk <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>car,</b> at which point Savage reversed out and drove away from the scene.

5|$|Nancy never lacks money, and {{in later}} {{volumes of the}} series often travels to faraway locations, such as France in The Mystery of the 99 Steps (1966), Nairobi in The Spider Sapphire Mystery (1968), Austria in Captive Witness (1981), Japan in The Runaway Bride (1994), Costa Rica in Scarlet Macaw Scandal (2004), and Alaska in Curse of The Arctic Star (2013). Nancy is also able to travel freely about the United States, thanks in part <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>car,</b> which is a blue {{roadster}} in the original series and a blue convertible in the later books. Despite the trouble and presumed expense to which she goes to solve mysteries, Nancy never accepts monetary compensation; however, by implication, her expenses are often paid by a client of her father's, {{as part of the}} costs of solving one of his cases.|$|E
5|$|Stewart, Harvick and Edwards led at the lap 57 restart. Two laps later, Earnhardt and Edwards {{temporarily}} {{moved to}} the front of the field but Stewart retook the lead on the same lap. On the final lap, McMurray drove down from the top lane after exiting turn two, and went into Almirola in the middle lane, causing Almirola to make contact with Danica Patrick on the backstraightaway, sending her car spinning 180 degrees, and straight into the inside wall which she hit with her right-hand side, sustaining heavy damage <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>car.</b> The crash caused the third and final caution of the race to be shown. Patrick was unhurt; she was able to walk to an ambulance that took her to the in-field medical center. The field was frozen in place, with the order of finish determined by where the drivers were when the caution began. This gave Stewart the victory; Earnhardt finished second, and Ambrose finished third. Burton and Edwards completed the top five finishers. McDowell and Robby Gordon earned transfers to qualify for the Daytona 500. The first race had a total of three cautions and eight lead changes among five different drivers. Hamlin's total of 27 laps led was the most of any competitor. Stewart led three times for a total of 21 laps.|$|E

25|$|Gibbons' gubernatorial {{campaign}} manager, Robert Uithoven, speculated in {{an e-mail}} to Gibbons' supporters that Dina Titus, Gibbons' opponent, hired the woman to entice Gibbons. Titus retorted that to do this she would have had to control where Gibbons went, who he was with, and even the weather (Gibbons claimed he was helping the woman <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>car</b> {{in part because of the}} weather).|$|E

25|$|Gabrion {{was tried}} in 2002 {{for the murder}} of Rachel Timmerman. The {{prosecution}} presented testimony from multiple witnesses describing Gabrion's propensity for violence and threatening behaviors, including accusations of other physical and sexual assaults. Two witnesses testified that their homes had been set on fire following altercations with Gabrion. Another woman described how Gabrion trained a rifle on her and her two-year-old child as she walked <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>car</b> one day. He then climbed into his own car and followed them for several miles. The disappearances of the other men surrounding the case were also admitted.|$|E
500|$|For the defence, Robin Grey QC, {{explained}} to the jury that such was the extent of Hodgson's compulsive lying that he had confessed to 200 different crimes, including murders that had not happened. The Crown's case against Hodgson was that he [...] "under the influence of drink, broke into the deceased's car, intending to steal it, but then fell asleep on the back seat. When the deceased returned <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>car</b> she put her handbag onto {{the back seat and}} brushed against [...] He seized her by the back of her jumper, twisted it and strangled her, and when she was dead or dying he raped her, removing her underwear and tights with such force that one leg of the tights was torn from the other. Thereafter he made away from the scene after taking various items from the deceased." [...] Hodgson's confessions were {{a significant part of the}} case against him. The jury retired to consider their verdict at 11:00a.m. on 5February 1982, and their unanimous guilty verdict was returned at 14:15 (2:15p.m.) the same day.|$|E
500|$|With {{the fall}} of the Taliban, Pope John Paul II {{requested}} that Fr. Moretti return to Afghanistan. The first Mass in 9 years was celebrated on January 27, 2002, for members of the International Security Force and various members of foreign agencies. On May 16, 2002, a mission sui iuris was created for all of Afghanistan. There is only one functioning chapel in the country, in the Italian Embassy in Kabul. Projects of the new mission include a [...] "Peace School" [...] for 500 students that began construction in August 2003 and will be to [...] "European standards". Three religious sisters also work with those who have mental disabilities in the capital city, teaching those with cerebral palsy how to go to the toilet and how to eat on their own. The small community went through a period of crisis during the kidnapping on May 17, 2005, of Clementina Cantoni, a member of CARE International, by four gunmen in Kabul as she walked <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>car.</b> Sisters from the Missionaries of Charity had their house blessed on May 9, 2006, and have already started taking in street children. There had been fears that their distinctive blue and white habit would make them stand out and be harassed by Muslims, but their institute is generally respected.

Jesuit Refugee Services has recently opened a technical school in Herat for 500 students including 120 girls.|$|E

500|$|Professor Roy M. Anker {{argues that}} the film's {{thematic}} center is its direction to the audience to [...] "look closer". The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the Burnhams' neighborhood with Lester's narrated admission {{that this is the}} last day of his life, forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them. It also sets a series of mysteries; Anker asks, [...] "from what place exactly, and from what state of being, is he telling this story? If he's already dead, why bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive? There is also the question of how Lester has died—or will die." [...] Anker believes the preceding scene—Jane's discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father—adds further mystery. Professor Ann C. Hall disagrees; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery, the film allows the audience to put it aside [...] "to view the film and its philosophical issues". Through this examination of Lester's life, rebirth and death, American Beauty satirizes American middle class notions of meaning, beauty and satisfaction. Even Lester's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela; he therefore remains a [...] "willing devotee of the popular media's exaltation of pubescent male sexuality as a sensible route to personal wholeness". Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness; from her belief in [...] "house beautiful" [...] domestic bliss <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>car</b> and gardening outfit, Carolyn's domain is a [...] "fetching American millennial vision of Pleasantville, or Eden". The Burnhams are unaware that they are [...] "materialists philosophically, and devout consumers ethically" [...] who expect the [...] "rudiments of American beauty" [...] to give them happiness. Anker argues that [...] "they are helpless {{in the face of the}} prettified economic and sexual stereotypes that they and their culture have designated for their salvation." ...|$|E

Jeanene rushed him <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>car,</b> where she gave him a flask of vodka to ward off the withdrawal delirium. She would later report that after getting back to his home in Smyrna, and giving him alcohol, he became [...] "lucid, in a real good mood, calling his friends on the phone."

Bland repeatedly asks why she is under arrest, and Encinia responds, [...] "I am giving you a lawful order." [...] She refuses to leave her car, stating she is not under arrest as she is unaware of the reason and not obliged to. Encinia then opens her car door and tells her more than a dozen times {{to get out of the}} car before [...] he tries to pull her out. After struggling, he draws his Taser and points it at Bland, shouting [...] "I will light you up! Get out! Now!", at which point she exits her vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|On {{a routine}} {{training}} ride near Boulder, Wellington suffered a serious bike crash on Saturday 24 September, exactly {{two weeks before}} the World Championships in Kona. She received severe road rash (equivalent to second- or third-degree burns) on her left leg and injuries to her left elbow and hip. Wellington described the pain as [...] "intense", much worse than the fractures she had suffered earlier in the year, but X-rays showed no broken bones. Her first attempt at training after the accident was on the following Tuesday when, despite a swollen, infected leg, she tried swimming. She could manage no more than two lengths, in pain she later described as [...] "excruciating". She had to be lifted out of the pool, and given crutches to enable her to walk; her boyfriend Tom Lowe and coach Dave Scott had to carry her back <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>car.</b> The next day, Wednesday, she was due to fly to Kona, but she preferred to remain in Boulder, close to the experts treating her.
