They unscrew the base of the light pole, take their equipment, attach it to that, get the electricity – Boom! We got a concert right here in the schoolyard and it's this guy Kool Herc. And he's just standing with the turntable, and <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>were</b> studying his hands. There are people dancing, but there's as many people standing, just watching what he's doing. That was my first introduction to in-the-street, hip hop DJing." ...|$|E
500|$|Beth Johnson of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] a [...] "candy-pop-with-a-funky-edge smash", while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic {{said the}} song was [...] "ingenious", Brian Raftery of Blender called it [...] "a {{perfectly}} fine, slickly conceived pop tune. [...] At the time, teen-pop was still a boys’ club, but while <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>were</b> crooning about crushes, Spears was already planning the sleep-over party". Rolling Stone called it [...] "some of the best radio pop of the past decade-plus". NME considered [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] "incredible", commenting that [...] "it's a symphony of teenage lust as fully realised as anything Brian Wilson ever wrote – a truly grand pop song that overwhelms any lingering undercurrent of Lolita paedo-creepiness through the sheer fanatical earnestness of its delivery." [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] won a Teen Choice Award for Single of the Year and an MTV Europe Music Award for Best Song.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, Amy Reiter of the L.A. Times stated, [...] "Like the women, once 10 of <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>were</b> {{given the}} chance to compete for our votes, the five remaining...were collectively shuffled before us, looking stunned and solemn, and then sent home, this time with a few tepidly {{encouraging}} parting words from the judges." ...|$|E

As <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> taken to <b>the</b> bonfire it is followed by people dressed up carrying flaming torches. <b>The</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> lifted onto top of the bonfire; when <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> alight, <b>the</b> fireworks display begins. The event is very popular and although it is free, donations collected go towards next year's event and local charities such as coal for pensioners.|$|R

2500|$|Since {{the late}} 1970s, some {{former members of}} the Memphis Mafia have written books on Elvis. The first exposé book, [...] {{appeared}} in 1977 shortly before Elvis's death. This so-called Bodyguard book came from the West cousins and Dave Hebler. They wrote about Presley's years of prescription drug abuse which eventually led to his death. Red was honest with Elvis about his medication problems. <b>The</b> <b>guys</b> <b>were</b> fired, but not by Elvis. That must have hurt." [...] Elvis had [...] "even offered the publishers money not to go ahead with it. For Vernon the book was proof of his long-held distrust and dislike not just of those three but of the whole of the Memphis Mafia ..." [...] Even George Klein, who chastised and shunned other members of the group for writing books about Elvis, ended up writing a book as well.|$|E
2500|$|Hughes {{suggested}} to Columbus that they cast Macaulay Culkin {{in the main}} role because of his experience with the child actor while shooting Uncle Buck. Columbus met with other actors for the part, by his count [...] "hundreds and hundreds", as {{he felt it was}} his [...] "directorial responsibility". Columbus finally met with Culkin and agreed he was the right choice for the role. Due to Culkin's age, he could only work until 10 PM which created shooting problems for the crew because of the movie's many night-time scenes. The film's stunts also created tension for the crew during shooting. Columbus said, [...] "Every time the stunt guys did one of those stunts it wasn’t funny. We’d watch it, and I would just pray that <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>were</b> alive." [...] Stunts were originally prepared with safety harnesses, but because of their visibility on camera, the film's final stunts were performed without them.|$|E
2500|$|The group {{developed}} a reputation for exciting and polished live performances that enabled them to work even {{without the benefit of}} best-selling records. Choreographer Atkins designed [...] "fast-stepping" [...] dance routines that became a signature of the Pips' stage presentation; Atkins later described his working and personal relationship with the group in his autobiography, Class Act: The Jazz Life of Choreographer Cholly Atkins: [...] "The one thing that I was pleased about was a stipulation in my contract that allowed me to keep working with Gladys Knight & the Pips as personal clients even though I would be an employee of Motown Records. To tell the truth, Gordy wasn't too happy about it at first, but this is something that I would not compromise under any circumstances. By that time, Gladys and <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>were</b> like my own children!" [...] The group was a touring standout during this period with Knight's contralto lead vocals and the Pips' impeccable choreography and characteristic background vocals becoming highlights.|$|E

2500|$|Lechuza was {{released}} on May 22, 2001 and debuted on No.87 of the Billboard 200, with its single [...] "Threesome" [...] reaching No.66 on the UK Singles Chart. The album featured a total of eleven songs, {{all of which were}} more raucous and energetic than those on the band's previous efforts, with occasional escapes into heavy metal-esque guitar distortion paired with screaming vocal patterns. The reason for the change in style was Lewis' and DeLaPaz's constant feelings of disapproval for the band's songs, as revealed by Salazar in an interview in late 2002: [...] " [...] for Lechuza <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>were</b> looking for a different direction so they wrote some songs that were way different, like Something Bad's Gonna Happen and Pasture of Muppets, just so that they could have some songs that they could, in their words, actually have fun playing onstage." [...] One of these songs, [...] "Beating a Dead Horse", explicitly addresses the problems that had arisen within the band.|$|E
2500|$|From 1820 to 1865 Guildford was {{the scene}} of severe outbursts of semi-organised {{lawlessness}} commonly known as the [...] "Guy Riots". The Guys would mass {{on the edge of the}} town from daybreak on Guy Fawkes Night, wearing masks or bizarre disguises and armed with clubs and lighted torches. At nightfall they would enter the town and avenge themselves on those who had crossed them in the preceding year by committing assaults and damaging property, often looting the belongings of victims from their houses and burning them on bonfires in the middle of the street. In later years attempts to suppress the Guys led to the deaths of two police officers. In 1866 and 1868 <b>the</b> <b>Guys</b> <b>were</b> dispersed by cavalry and this seems to have brought an end to the riots. Similar disorder surrounding the St Catherine's Hill Fair, held just outside the town on the Pilgrims' Way, was suppressed around the same time. In 1906 the Guildford Union Workhouse Casuals Ward ("The Spike") was built on the grounds of the Workhouse near the castle; today The Spike is a tourist attraction.|$|E
