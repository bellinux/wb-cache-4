In August 1943, Price conducted a brief dig in the cellars of the ruined house and discovered two bones thought to be of a young woman. The bones were given a Christian burial in Liston churchyard, after the parish of Borley refused to allow the ceremony to take place {{on account of the}} local opinion that the bones found were those of a pig.|$|E

Three main factors which affect <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pad, including the {{polishing pad}} creep deformation, the calibration plate grinding and the ambient change in temperature, are analyzed in this work. Processing parameters including the eccentricity between the polishing pad and the calibration plate, the calibration plate thickness, angular velocities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pad are introduced in this analytic process.

5|$|Built in 1260, {{the church}} {{belongs to the}} {{transition}} period from Romanesque to Gothic architecture. The first {{is characterized by the}} plant ornament of the capital of the pilasters and the second by thee star (asteroid) vaults. The portal was also originally Romanesque – the vimperg on the round arch had a niche with <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patron saint. The inner walls were covered with paintings, the floor consisting of the gravestones of clergymen and distinguished noblemen. A unique round baptismal chapel was built {{in the second half of}} the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|From <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artist, the viewer's eye leaps again diagonally {{into the}} {{pictorial}} space. Another man stands, echoing and opposing {{the form of}} the artist, outside rather than inside, made clearly defined and yet barely identifiable by the light and shade. The positioning of such an area of strong tonal contrast right {{at the rear of the}} pictorial space is a daring compositional tactic. The shapes of bright light are similar to the irregular light shapes of the foreground Maid of Honour, but the sharply defined door-frame repeats the border of the mirror.|$|E

5|$|Gender roles, {{especially}} <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ideal woman, {{are central}} to La Cousine Bette. The four leading female characters (Bette, Valérie, Adeline, and Hortense) embody stereotypically feminine traits. Each pair of women revolves around a man, and they compete for his attention: Valérie and Adeline for Baron Hulot; Bette and Hortense for Wenceslas Steinbock. Balzac's study of masculinity {{is limited to the}} insatiable lust of Hulot and the weak-willed inconstancy of Steinbock, with the occasional appearance of Victorin as a sturdy patriarch in his father's absence.|$|E
5|$|In The Orrery, all the {{subjects}} {{have been identified}} apart from the philosopher, who has physical similarities to Isaac Newton but differs enough to make positive identification impossible. Nicolson detects the strong influence of Frye throughout the picture. Particularly striking is the similarity between Frye's mezzotint Portrait of a Young Man of 1760–1761 and <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boy with his head cocked staring intently at the bird. In 1977, Michael Wynne published one of Frye's chalk drawings from around 1760, An old man leaning on a staff, which is so similar to the observer in the right foreground in Wright's picture to make it impossible that Wright had not seen it. There are other hints of Frye's style in the painting: even <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural philosopher has touches of Frye's Figure with Candle. Though Henry Fuseli would later also develop on the style of Frye's work {{there is no evidence}} of him having painted anything similar until the early 1780s. So, although he had already been in England at the time the Air Pump was produced, it is unlikely that he was an influence on Wright.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, {{the vampire}} is {{generally}} {{held to be}} a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, creating <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vampire to explain the mysteries of death. Porphyria was also linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.|$|E

Njörðr is sometimes modernly anglicized as Njord, Njoerd, or Njorth.|$|E
5|$|Nora Chadwick (1950) {{suggested}} that mythical legends of Þorgerðr and Irpa have become confused and intertwined with historical accounts of Haakon’s wife Þóra and her sister, Guðrún; and that <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shieldmaiden Lagertha in the Gesta {{may also be}} an aspect of Þorgerðr. Lotte Motz (1993) proposed that Þorgerðr was a rare instance of a giantess who was the recipient of cultic worship {{in her own right}} in heathen Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Piattoli was an {{inspiration}} to Leo Tolstoy, who based <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Abbé Morio in War and Peace (1869) on him.

In his 1980 ten-page entry on Piattoli in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, historian Emanuel Rostworowski notes that, “despite two Italian monographs (by A.D. Ancon and G. Bozzolato)”, Piattoli still awaits a definitive biography.|$|E

5|$|After the Acts of Union in 1707 {{the royal}} family spent very little time in, or money on, Scottish palaces and many Scottish nobles {{followed}} the royal court to England, tending to invest in sculpture for their residences in London, rather than their estates in Scotland. With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public statuary, often with the patronage of a public institution, such as the lead figure of George II at the newly founded Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh in 1753 or <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judge Duncan Forbes for the Outer Parliament House in 1752. The portrait bust, designed for interior display, also became popular. By {{the middle of the}} century statuary were preferred to painted portraits among the aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{discovers that}} her predecessor, Emily Jessel (Lightfoot), {{is buried in}} Bly's church, and is told that Jessel killed herself. She also begins to see the figures {{of a young man}} and a young woman around Bly. Mrs Grose dismisses Ann's stories, but one maid, Carla (Walker), tells Ann of the sexually abusive former valet Peter Quint (MacLiam). Mrs Grose reveals that Carla had been badly {{affected}} by the War, and is prone to flights of fancy. Later, Ann is woken at night by <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman, and follows her to find Flora standing next to an open window. The pair see Carla fall from the roof, landing near Miles, who is in the garden. Ann rushes outside, and sees the male figure on the roof. Inside again, Mrs Grose assures Ann that she must be confused.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates {{that most of the}} Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E

5|$|In Native American mythology, the bobcat {{is often}} twinned with <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coyote in {{a theme of}} duality. Lynx and coyote are {{associated}} with the fog and wind, respectively—two elements representing opposites in Native American folklore. This basic story, in many variations, is found in the native cultures of North America (with parallels in South America), but they diverge in the telling. One version, which appears in the Nez Perce folklore for instance, depicts lynx and coyote as opposed, antithetical beings. However, another version depicts them with equality and identicality. Claude Lévi-Strauss argues the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is an inherent theme in New World mythologies, but they are not equally balanced figures, representing an open-ended dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures. The latter notion then, Lévi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures. Additionally, the version found in the Nez Perce story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to have lost the tale's original meaning.|$|E
5|$|Klaus {{tells of}} the Krampus, unnerving Kathy. Before bed, Toby leaves out his boots for the Krampus, and Kathy empties a bottle of tablets. The next morning, Toby's boots are filled with switches, indicating—according to Klaus's story—that he has been visited by the Krampus due to his naughtiness. Celia {{suspects}} Kathy, who is not Toby's mother, but Julian rebukes her. At dinner, Toby {{tells of the}} wonderful day he has had with Klaus. Toby heads to bed, and Kathy speculates that Toby was sleepwalking the night before, becoming agitated when Julian and Celia are unconvinced. That night, both Toby and Celia are out of bed, and <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Krampus is seen. The next day, scratches are found on Toby's body, and Celia leaves with the child.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{replicates}} all {{the features}} of the pastoral scene in an urban landscape. The shepherds and shepherdesses become the beggars and whores, the sun overhead is replaced by the clock on the church, the snow-capped mountains become the snowy rooftops. Even the setting of Covent Garden with piles of fruit and vegetables echoes the country scene. In the centre of the picture the icy goddess of the dawn {{in the form of the}} prim churchgoer is followed by her shivering red-nosed pageboy, mirroring Hesperus, the dawn bearer. The woman is the only one who seems unaffected by the cold, suggesting it may be her element. Although outwardly shocked, the dress of the woman, which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in the painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow, may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind. She is commonly described as a spinster, and considered to be a hypocrite, ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable ermine muff while displaying no charity to her freezing footboy or the half-seen beggar before her. <b>The</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spinster is said to be based on a relative of Hogarth, who, recognising herself in the picture, cut him out of her will. Fielding later used the woman as the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in Tom Jones.|$|E
