40|$|The study {{described}} here investigated {{the differences in}} chemical characteristics between peat deposits with different geological origin, geomorphology, hydrology and botanical composition. The variation of chemical properties with depth was compared between fen, <b>transition</b> <b>mire</b> and raised bog peat deposits occurring in south and south-west Poland. Degree of decomposition, pH, Na+, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, N, ash and humic substances content were determined, and cluster {{analysis was used to}} describe the chemical variation amongst peat samples and peatland sites. The peat deposits showed high chemical variability between mire types, and even within the same botanical peat type; and peat from geographically distant peatlands could be chemically more similar than peat from different locations within a single mire complex. Thus, purely botanical classifications appear to be of limited utility as indicators of the conditions under which peat formation occurred...|$|E

As {{the focus of the}} government is on nitrogen, the nitrogen load in this area will be assess based on literature, expert knowledge and modelling. In Laag Holland the habitat typeâ€™s Wet heath and <b>Transition</b> <b>mire</b> are the nitrogen sensitive habitat types. The current nitrogen load is too high for vegetation development. Nitrogen reaches the system by surface water, atmospheric deposition and mineralization. The nitrogen load of the surface water, in addition to the phosphate and sulphate load, is too high for the initiation of new hydroseres. Local sources contribute to the nitrogen deposition, agricultural emissions contributes for 33 % to the average nitrogen deposition and up to 70 % of the average ammonia deposition. Road traffic contributes less, on average less than 5 %, but this can increase locally up to 25 %, of the total deposition. Industry contributes on average as well as locally less than 5 % to the total nitrogen deposition. 	 Source and effect related measures can be taken to reduce the nitrogen load or negative effects of nitrogen. However for long term conservation generic and European policies are needed to reduce the deposition load a nature reserves. Balancing of deposition is only a temporary solution as eventually the deposition has to decrease to the critical loads. The mineralization can be reduced by increased water supply with water low in nutrient concentrations, the effect of salinity only seems to be temporarily...|$|E

40|$|For this thesis, I {{examined}} the effects of the re-introduction of fluctuating surface water levels in freshwater wetlands. These systems, and especially the rich fen wetlands that I focused on, often consist of a mosaic of aquatic, semi-aquatic and terrestrial vegetation types, including many biodiverse communities with high numbers of endangered species. Rich fens are protected under the European Habitat Directive (<b>transition</b> <b>mires</b> and quaking bogs, type H 7140), and are characteristic for well-buffered (with respect to acidity) and nutrient-poor conditions. Next to overall eutrophication, high NH 4 -concentrations may specifically be toxic to bryophytes and vascular plants in rich fens. For the preservation and restoration of rich fens, it is therefore important to prevent acidification, eutrophication and toxicity. As a general conclusion, I have been able to unravel the differential effects of water table fluctuation in rich fens in relation to surface water quality, peat quality and season, by the combination of correlative field research, large-scale and smaller scale field manipulation experiments, climate room and peat incubation experiments. In this way, this thesis not only contributes to more fundamental biogeochemical and ecological issues related to surface water level fluctuations, but can also be used for decision support in the hydrological management of rich fens...|$|R
50|$|Cors Caron was {{additionally}} assessed as {{possessing the}} following qualifying, non-priority habitats:Transition mires and quaking bogs described as:The term 'transition mire' relates to vegetation that in floristic composition and general ecological characteristics is transitional between acid bog and 7230 Alkaline fens, {{in which the}} surface conditions range from markedly acidic to slightly base-rich. The vegetation normally has intimate mixtures of species considered to be acidophile and others thought of as calciphile or basophile. In some cases the mire occupies a physically transitional location between bog and fen vegetation, as for example on the marginal lagg of raised bog or associated with certain valley and basin mires. In other cases these intermediate properties may reflect the actual process of succession, as peat accumulates in groundwater-fed fen or open water to produce rainwater-fed bog isolated from groundwater influence. Many of these systems are very unstable underfoot and can therefore also be described as 'quaking bogs'.Depressions on peat substrates of the Rhynchosporion described as:occurring in complex mosaics with lowland wet heath and valley <b>mire</b> vegetation, in <b>transition</b> <b>mires,</b> and {{on the margins of}} bog pools and hollows in both raised and blanket bogs.

40|$|Manmade {{changes of}} landscapes {{and the loss}} of {{biodiversity}} through an on-going intensification of agricultural land use demand for the monitoring of natural habitats, vegetation types and their changes. EU Policies like the Flora-Fauna-Habitat (FFH) directive or the High Nature Value (HNV) farmland (EU rural policy framework) request the observation and conservation of natural vegetation with a reporting duty on the conservation status of these areas every six and four years. The FFH directive includes natural and semi-natural vegetation identified as Natura 2000 conservation areas and the HNV farmlands are areas in which the major land use is agriculture but also include a high species and habitat diversity or species of European conservation concern. In the context of this major demand of reporting, remote sensing has great advantages as basis for monitoring of vegetation types and habitats, as it is able to provide large-scale up-to-date geo-information for these monitoring and management activities. However, the monitoring of vegetation demands for data acquisitions at specific times during the growing season. SAR-based systems have the great advantage of acquiring data of the Earth surface within these crucial time frames weather and daytime independent. TerraSAR-X (TS-X) has the potential to acquire images with a high spatial resolution of less than 10 m {{and at the same time}} a high temporal resolution of 11 days repetition rate. In addition, textural information and the potential to analyse dielectric characteristics (e. g. moisture) enable the differentiation of various vegetation types and the deduction of biophysical characteristics. Within the project MSAVE, the applicability of temporally and geometrically high resolution data of optical, SAR and hyperspectral sensors for the monitoring of vegetation is evaluated and new methods for the analysis of multi-seasonal remote sensing data are developed, which are suited for the identification and quantification of habitats. The herein presented work as part of the project centres the evaluation of the differentiability of NATURA 2000 habitats and HNV grassland with TS-X time series data. Thereby, a TS-X time series consisting of 11 dual-pol (VV/VH) acquisitions in 2011 for the test area located in Southern Bavaria as well as reference data collected during several field surveys within the SAR data collection period are used for the classification of different grassland types, which include the FFH habitat types 6410 (Molinia meadows), 7120 (Degraded raised bogs still capable of natural regeneration), 7140 (<b>Transition</b> <b>mires</b> and quaking bogs) and 7230 (Alkaline fens), as well as HNV grassland. Up-to-now, the TS-X time series has been pre-processed including multi-temporal filtering and the Kennaugh decomposition developed by Schmitt, A. (2012) has been applied to the data. Furthermore, texture features were derived. After a separability analysis for defining the best suitable features for discriminating the different grassland types, the classification is performed with the Maximum-Entropy algorithm. First results show that the high temporal and geometric resolution time series of TS-X allows for a detailed analysis on the usability of polarimetric SAR data for the classification of different vegetation types. The distribution of FFH habitats and HNV grassland can be modelled by means of Kennaugh elements of cross-polar TS-X time series data. The discrimination of the different grassland types is further improved including texture features in the classification...|$|R
40|$|South Africa's role in Africa {{since its}} {{democratic}} <b>transition</b> has been <b>mired</b> in controversy and characterised by differing interpretations. While it has wrestled ambivalently about constructing an African {{identity in the}} Mandela years, President Mbeki has firmly located South Africa's interests in Africa.

40|$|We studied 45 mid-boreal {{wetlands}} in {{a rugged}} land uplift coast {{with a thin}} cover of till. Wetlands ranged from 1 to 53 m a. s. l. and were of highly various sizes. Our aims were to examine, if vegetation types are valid in comparing wetlands, what kind of ecological major pattern the vegetation type composition of wetlands shows and how vegetation types distribute across altitudes. On those ground we discuss the wetland succession of the study area. We used the Finnish mire site types as vegetation types. Mire site types {{could be used for}} an ecological classification and ordination of the wetlands. As was expected, the major gradient consisted of the <b>transition</b> from <b>mire</b> margin (swamp) to expanse. The distribution of the Major Vegetational Wetland Groups (MVWG) responded to a general water-flow pattern in the landscape. Partly different peatland succession sequences occur in areas with small mire basins and in areas with larger mire basins with evolving mire complexes. Sequences of small wetlands and those of mire complexes follow the same trajectory only as far as the major gradient is considered while they differ with regard to the vegetation type composition of locally rare vegetation types and with regard to peatland morphology. Trajectories of mire complexes at catchment divides differ from those at catchment centers where the waters in the landscape tend to gather. Peatland forms of aapa mires experience a change reaching altitudes of 30 â€“ 50 m a. s. l. Small bog complexes at catchment divides reach a stage of an unpatterned Sphagnum fuscum bog in the study area. Mature mixed complexes with aapa-mire parts and patterned sloping-bog parts only occur at altitudes higher than 60 m a. s. l. Peculiarities in the succession of the wetlands of Nyby, which include the presence of separate incomplete successional sequences in the same area, are mainly caused by the peculiar topography with various sub-areas and with an abundance of rock outcrops...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{concern has}} grown over the {{consequences}} of global warming. The arctic region {{is thought to be}} particularly vulnerable to increasing temperatures, and warming is occurring here substantially more rapidly than at lower latitudes. Consequently, assessments {{of the state of the}} Arctic are a focus of international efforts. For the terrestrial Arctic, large datasets are generated by remote sensing of above-ground variables, with an emphasis on vegetation properties, and, by association, carbon fluxes. However, the terrestrial component of the carbon (C) cycle remains poorly quantified and the below-ground distribution and stocks of soil C can not be quantified directly by remote sensing. Large areas of the Arctic are also difficult to access, limiting field surveys. The scientific community does know, however, that this region stores a massive proportion (although poorly quantified, soil C stocks for tundra soils vary from 96 to 192 Gt C) of the global reservoir of soil carbon, much of it in permafrost (900 Gt C), and these stocks may be very vulnerable to increased rates of decomposition due to rising temperatures. The consequences of this could be increasing source strength of the radiatively forcing gases carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4). The principal objective of this project is to provide a critical evaluation of methods used to link soil C stocks and fluxes at the usual scales spanned by the field surveys (centimetre to kilometre) and remote sensing surveys (kilometre to hundreds of kilometres). The soil C distribution of two sub-arctic sites in contrasting climatic, landscape/geomorphologic and vegetation settings has been described and analysed. The transition between birch forest and tundra heath in the Abisko (Swedish Lapland) field site, and the <b>transition</b> between <b>mire</b> and birch forest in the Kevo (Finnish Lapland) field site span several vegetation categories and landscape contexts. The natural variability of below-ground C stocks (excluding coarse roots > 2 mm diameter), at scales from the centimetre to the kilometre scale, is high: 0. 01 to 18. 8 kg C m- 2 for the 0 - 4 cm depth in a 2. 5 km 2 area of Abisko. The depths of the soil profiles and the soil C stocks are not directly linked to either vegetation categories or Leaf Area Index (LAI), thus vegetation properties are not a straightforward proxy for soil C distribution. When mapping soil or vegetation categories over large areas, it is usually necessary to aggregate several vegetation or soil categories to simplify the output (both for mapping and for modelling). Using this approach, an average value of 2. 3 kg C m- 2 was derived both for soils beneath treeless areas and forest understorey. This aggregated value is potentially misleading, however, because there is significant skew resulting from the inclusion of exposed ridges (with very low soil C stocks) in the â€˜treelessâ€™ category. Furthermore, if birch trees colonise tundra heath and other â€˜openâ€™ plant communities in the coming decades, there will likely be substantial shifts in soil C stocks. This will be both due to direct climate effects on decomposition, but also due to changes in above- and below-ground C inputs (both in quantity and quality) and possibly changes in so-called root â€˜primingâ€™ effects on the decomposition of existing organic matter. A model of soil respiration using parameters from field surveys shows that soils of the birch forest are more sensitive to increases in mean annual temperature than soils under tundra heath. The heterogeneity of soil properties, moisture and temperature regimes and vegetation cover in ecotone areas means that responses to climate change will differ across these landscapes. Any exercise in upscaling results from field surveys has to indicate the heterogeneity of vegetation and soil categories to guide soil sampling and modelling of C cycle processes in the Arctic...|$|R
40|$|This thesis assesses {{aspects of}} the wetland development, {{permafrost}} dynamics and associated changes in carbon and nutrient cycling of the Stordalen Mire in northern Sweden. Various ecological and biogeochemical analyses of one peat and two lake sediment sequences were conducted, including analyses of organic matter and carbonate content, mosses, diatoms, testate amoebae, pigments, carbon and nitrogen and their stable isotopes, near infrared spectroscopy and biogenic silica. Results revealed that the structural development of the mire occurred during the later part of the Holocene. Peat inception was dated at 4700 cal BP and onset of organic sedimentation in two adjacent lake basins occurred at 3400 and 2650 cal BP. Fen peat accumulated until minimum 2800 cal BP, and after c. 2650 cal BP an early permafrost aggradation phase likely caused frost heave and {{significant changes in the}} wetland structure and hydrology. Peat is largely missing in the examined core between 2800 and 1350 cal BP, reflecting either environmental stress causing a decrease/cease of peat accumulation and/or erosion of previously formed peat. An increased content of redeposited peat in one of the lakes after c. 2100 cal BP, points to mire erosion caused by permafrost decay. A high nutrient/productivity layer in the other lake between 1900 and 1800 cal BP may have been related to the same event in the mire. Sedge peat accumulated from 1350 cal BP. Renewed permafrost aggradation is indicated indirectly around 700 cal BP and directly 120 cal BP from changes in peat building vegetation. Fen peat and <b>transitions</b> between dominating <b>mire</b> vegetation communities were characterized by frequent diatoms and high nutrient concentrations. Permafrost phases were associated with poor fen and bog formation, and thus considerably more acidic conditions in the mire as compared to pH conditions when richer fen communities dominated. This development resulted in more acidic runoff to adjacent lakes and affected carbonate precipitation there. Further, poor catchment retention of nutrients during poor fen/bog stages, probably caused increased fluxes of nutrients out of the system, stimulating primary lake productivity in adjacent lakes. Increased lake productivity in turn caused increased oxygen consumption for decomposition at the lake bottom, and thus anoxic conditions. Thereby an increased flux of phosphorous from the sediment triggered a state of self-sustained eutrophication during two centuries, preceding the onset of 20 th century permafrost thaw. Proxy indications of peat surface moisture conditions and lake-water TOC concentration dynamics during the last 100 years were reconstructed by means of testate amoebae assemblages in peat and near infrared spectroscopy and the carbon isotopic composition of lake sediment bulk organic matter. These results revealed a close connection with decadal trends of total annual and summer precipitation as well as single years with anomalously high precipitation, especially in the late summer. The data could thus not be directly linked to monitored trends in active layer thickness...|$|R
40|$|Mire {{ecosystem}} engineers {{create an}} acidic, nutrient poor and slowly permeable peat due to specific morphological, physiological and organo-chemical properties, changing {{the ecology of}} fens (high-nutrient, wet mires) so that they become bogs (low nutrient mires with drier surfaces), the so-called fen-bog transition. Observations {{on the development of}} raised restiad bogs in New Zealand support the concept of ecosystem engineering in forming raised mires, but involving the species Empodisma) minus and Empodisma) robustum, of the family Restionaceae. The aim of this thesis is to examine the facility with which Empodisma) minus fits the model of the ecosystem engineer of the fen-bog transition in New Zealand, and the techniques used to achieve that transition. A model for identifying mire engineers is proposed, based on the collated literature. Species best able to compete in the low nutrient raised mire environment possess morphological adaptations to increase nutrient capture, or traits which minimise nutrient losses (low tissue nutrient levels, high leaf longevity, high nutrient resorption prior to abscission). Whilst both Empodisma) minus and Chionochloa) rubra appear to possess nutrient retention and capture traits, Empodisma minus appears to out-compete Chionochloa) rubra in low nutrient mires, implying superior nutrient capture or retention strategies. In a survey of 70 mire communities in New Zealand â€“ taking canopy biomass, soil physico- chemistry and the existence of capillaroid root growth and hummock-hollow topography into account - it is clearly shown that Empodidma) minus is tolerant {{of a wide range of}} environmental conditions, thus enabling it to establish in minerotrophic fens, and persist after the fen-bog transition. In contrast to its widespread occurrence in wetland vegetation communities, extensive capillaroid root growth and the associated hummock-hollow topography occur less frequently. Despite P-limited growth being indicated, capillaroid root growth is infrequent or absent in coal pavement and pakihi communities, or where Empodisma) minus is not the dominant canopy species. Empodisma) minus appears to form capillaroid roots to maximise nutrient capture in the surface litter layer under a dense Empodisma canopy, and a complex relationship between capillaroid root formation, climate, canopy biomass and nutrients is indicated. Lower tissue nutrient levels where the species co-exist in mires suggest Empodisma) minus is a more frugal user of limiting nutrients than Chionochloa) rubra, of importance as the growing surface of the mire becomes increasingly dependent on ombrotrophic (rainfall) nutrient iv sources as a result of peat accumulation. I studied the competitive relations between Empodisma) minus and Chionochloa) rubra in a 26 month long, de Wit replacement competition experiment. Empodisma) minus is the superior competitor long-term in the oligotrophic conditions of the fen-bog <b>transition</b> and raised <b>mire</b> environments, providing a high water table is maintained; otherwise species co-existence will likely occur. These results suggest a dense Empodisma canopy is required to maintain the wet environment needed for apogeotropic root weft growth, which displayed plasticity in proliferation and placement. To further examine nutrient retention and loss traits in Empodisma) minus and Chionochloa) rubra, I evaluated their production and decomposition characteristics in a 12 month Litter Decomposition Experiment in a montane transitional mire. Empodisma) minus culms comprise much of the canopy biomass in wet, oligotrophic conditions of the mire environment, while Chionochloa) rubra tussocks are reduced in density and biomass. Mass losses after 12 months were lowest from Empodisma) minus capillaroid roots, which contain high fibre, and less P, K, and celluose than Chionochloa) rubra below-ground biomass. Both Empodisma) minus and Chionochloa) rubra produce low nutrient, slowly decomposing foliar litters, with Empodisma) minus) withdrawing much of the nutrient content from its senescing culms. While a large component of total litter inputs in transitional restiad fens may be comprised of senesced Empodisma) minus culms, the slower decay of Empodisma) minus capillaroid roots suggest these contribute an increasing proportion of the accumulating organic matter after 12 months. There is a significant relationship between short-term decay rates and location within the mire, however, this appears to be unrelated to the nutrient content or geochemistry of the substrate, and may reflect the influence of hummock-hollow topography and/or hydrology on decomposition. Empodisma) minus possesses both mechanisms employed in engineering the fen-bog transition - superior nutrient capture and nutrient retention - which results in increased production of slowly decaying capillaroid roots and foliage in oligotrophic mires, and hence increased peat accumulation. The mechanisms enable Empodisma) minus to engineer the fen-bog transition in New Zealand mires. ...|$|R
