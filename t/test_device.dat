25|$|A {{crash test}} dummy is a {{full-scale}} anthropomorphic <b>test</b> <b>device</b> (ATD) that simulates the dimensions, weight proportions and articulation of the human body, and is usually instrumented to record data about the dynamic behavior of the ATD in simulated vehicle impacts. The Crash Test Dummy is widely used by researchers and automobile companies to predict the biomechanics, force, impact, and injury {{of a human being}} in an automobile crash. This data can include variables such as velocity of impact, crushing force, bending, folding, or torque of the body, and deceleration rates during a collision for use in crash tests. The more advanced dummies are sophisticated machines designed to behave as a human body and with many sensors to record the forces of an impact; they may cost over US$400,000.|$|E
25|$|In 1949 an {{expatriate}} German, Ronald Richter, {{proposed the}} Huemul Project in Argentina, announcing positive results in 1951. These {{turned out to}} be fake, but it prompted considerable interest in the concept as a whole. In particular, it prompted Lyman Spitzer to begin considering ways to solve some of the more obvious problems involved in confining a hot plasma, and, unaware of the z-pinch efforts, he developed a new solution to the problem known as the stellarator. Spitzer applied to the US Atomic Energy Commission for funding to build a <b>test</b> <b>device.</b> During this period, Jim Tuck who had worked with the UK teams had been introducing the z-pinch concept to his coworkers at his new job at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). When he heard of Spitzer's pitch for funding, he applied to build a machine of his own, the Perhapsatron.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Gadget" [...] was a {{laboratory}} euphemism for a bomb, {{from which the}} laboratory's weapon physics division, [...] "G Division", took its name in August 1944. At that time it did not refer specifically to the Trinity <b>Test</b> <b>device</b> as it {{had yet to be}} developed, but once it was, it became the laboratory code name. The Trinity Gadget was officially a Y-1561 device, as was the Fat Man used a few weeks later in the bombing of Nagasaki. The two were very similar, with only minor differences, the most obvious being the absence of fuzing and the external ballistic casing. The bombs were still under development, and small changes continued to be made to the Fat Man design.|$|E

2500|$|Fusion One Corporation is a US {{organization}} {{founded in}} 2015 by Dr. Paul Sieck, Dr. Scott Cornish and Randall Volberg. They {{are developing a}} magneto-electrostatic reactor named [...] "F1" [...] that is based in-part on the polywell. It introduces a system of externally mounted electromagnet coils with internally mounted cathode repeller surfaces that provide a new means of preserving energy and particle losses {{that would otherwise be}} lost through the magnetic cusps. In response to Todd Rider's 1995 power balance conclusions, a new analytical model was developed based on this recovery function as well as a more accurate quantum relativistic treatment of the bremmstralung losses that was not present in Rider's analysis, which relied on interpolation. The new model demonstrated ample multiples of net gain with D-T and sufficient multiples with D-D to be used for generating electricity. Prior to building a scale reactor, they are developing an HPC simulation and benchtop <b>test</b> <b>device</b> using a modified spindle cusp to validate these results. Fusion One presented their work at the ARPA-E ALPHA 2017 Annual Review Meeting.|$|E
2500|$|A {{crash test}} dummy is a {{full-scale}} anthropomorphic <b>test</b> <b>device</b> that simulates the dimensions, weight proportions and articulation of the human body, and is usually instrumented to record data about the dynamic behavior of the ATD in simulated vehicle impacts. Using human and animal cadaver research from earlier studies, the first artificial {{crash test dummy}} was an anthropomorphic dummy named [...] "Sierra Sam". It was invented in 1949 by Samuel W. Alderson at his Alderson Research Labs (ARL) And Sierra Engineering Co. for the United States Air Force while conducting tests on aircraft ejection seats, pilot restraint harnesses, and aviation helmets. Alderson's early dummies and those of his competitors were fairly primitive, with no pelvic structure and little spinal articulation. With American automakers interested in durable crash test dummies that could be tested and retested while yielding back {{a broad spectrum of}} data during simulated automobile crashes, the first crash test dummy used for automative testing was again invented by Samuel Alderson in 1968. It was called the V.I.P. (Very Important Person) and it was built with dimensions of an average adult man coupled with a steel rib cage, articulated joints, a flexible neck, and a lumbar spine.|$|E
