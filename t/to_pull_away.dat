5|$|Liuzzi {{pulled over}} {{to the inside of}} the circuit on the third lap, at turn ten, with left-rear {{suspension}} damage resulting from contact with the wall. His retirement triggered the deployment of the safety car as marshals were required to push his car away from the track. Webber was the only top running driver to pit for the medium compound tyres during the safety car period on lap four. Red Bull had told Webber to enter the pit lane, assuring him that it was the right decision, though he questioned the move. Several drivers towards the rear also chose to pit. Racing resumed at the end of lap five when the safety car pulled into the pit lane. Webber immediately pushed hard and passed Glock for tenth position and a line of cars began to form behind Glock. Alonso began <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> from Vettel as he set consecutive fastest laps. Webber passed Kobayashi at turn five to move into ninth on lap seven, and withstood an attempt to Kobayashi to reclaim ninth heading into turn seven. Hülkenberg and Petrov's wheels made contact and both drivers went off the circuit on the same lap; Hülkenberg managed to move ahead of Petrov with Massa taking advantage to pass Petrov. Webber caught Schumacher on lap 11 and passed the latter on the same lap at turn five after Schumacher ran wide. Vettel was told by his team to cool his brakes on the same lap as Alonso continued to extend his lead. Sutil got ahead of Glock for eleventh place three laps later and started <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> from the queue behind Glock. Hülkenberg ran wide at turn seven on the same lap but did not lose any positions. Hülkenberg passed Glock in the first sector of the track for twelfth on lap16.|$|E
5|$|The {{second round}} opened at Hofstra's James M. Shuart Stadium with the Maryland–Syracuse match-up. Al Cavalieri filled {{in as the}} Orange goalkeeper for long-time starter John Galloway who was sick with the flu. Syracuse scored three {{unanswered}} goals {{in the first quarter}} before Maryland goalie Brian Phipps suffered an ACL tear. Terrapins midfielder Grant Catalino narrowed the deficit to 5–3 before halftime on an extra-man score. In the second half, Syracuse made defensive adjustments to shut down Maryland's behind-the-goal attack, and the Orange tallied three times in the span of 2:10 <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> in the third quarter. Syracuse won, 11–6, and extended its postseason streak against Maryland to five.|$|E
5|$|Although Hamilton became {{concerned}} about his Mercedes' brakes, {{he was told that}} it was a relatively minor sensor problem. He and Vergne reported that conditions had improved, but Vettel and Massa said that visibility remained poor. The safety car drove into the pit lane {{at the end of the}} ninth lap, and the cars were allowed to overtake. Button immediately made a pit stop to fit intermediate tyres. Hamilton attempted to pass Rosberg heading into the first corner, but could not overtake him. Rosberg began <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> from him; Vettel tried to pass Magnussen going into the hairpin, but was unable to complete the manoeuvre. He ran wide at the Spoon Curve, remaining on the track by running onto the kerb. Pérez overtook Kvyat to claim ninth position on the lap. At the end of the first racing lap, Rosberg led Hamilton by 1.3 seconds; Hamilton was followed by Bottas, Massa, Ricciardo, Magnussen, Vettel, Räikkönen, Pérez and Kvyat.|$|E

5|$|As Minerve {{turned back}} towards the British convoy with the {{intention}} of cutting off the rearmost ships, Astell passed her more damaged companions to become the first ship in line. This left Windham, now at the rear, to face Minerve alone. Fortunately for Stewart, Minerve lost two topmasts as she turned to face his ship and had <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> from the British to effect repairs. An hour and a half later, at 18:30, Bellone joined the action, attacking Windham directly. Victor supported Bellone and accompanied the flagship as she moved ahead to attack Ceylon and Astell. By 19:00, with Ceylon damaged so severely that she could no longer effectively sail or fight, third officer Tristam Fleming hauled the ship out of the battle line and ordered his crew to cease firing: Meriton and his second officer Thomas Oldham had both been seriously wounded by grape shot.|$|E
5|$|At the start, Hamilton, Massa and Kovalainen all {{maintained}} their grid positions. Hamilton quickly began <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> {{from the other}} cars, {{at the rate of}} about half a second per lap. Behind the leading trio, Kubica passed Räikkönen off the grid, and went on to pass both Alonso and Trulli at the hairpin (turn 4), when Alonso's own attempted pass on Trulli delayed both drivers. The fight for fourth position continued {{in the early stages of}} the race. Kubica ran wide at the final corner on lap four, impeding Trulli and therefore allowing Alonso to attempt an overtaking manoeuvre on the Toyota down the main straight. However, Trulli held on to his position, and Alonso was instead passed by Räikkönen, moving him down to sixth position. At the back of the field, Nakajima spun his Williams but recovered back onto the track and continued in the race.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{led away}} at the restart, but his Ferrari {{teammate}} Räikkönen was forced to pull into the pit lane on lap 22 with fire coming from his airbox and subsequently retired, handing second place to Rosberg. Over {{the next couple of}} laps, Vettel was able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> from Rosberg on the softer tyre compound. Marcus Ericsson was handed a drive-through penalty for having his team work on his car less than 15 seconds before the restart. By lap 31, the gap between Vettel and Rosberg started to come down again, while Hamilton moved ahead of Sainz into fifth as the latter made a pit stop. Two laps later, Verstappen was in as well, but a slow pit stop lost him time. On lap 35, Rosberg took the lead as Vettel made a pit stop, who also lost time due to a mistake during his stop. He emerged back on track in fourth place. Hamilton now started to pull back time on the leaders, while debutant Palmer held off the two Toro Rosso drivers in a struggle for ninth place.|$|E

5|$|After {{determining}} the ranges of {{motion in the}} joints of the forelimb, the study went on to hypothesize about the predatory habits of Acrocanthosaurus. The forelimbs could not swing forward very far, unable even to scratch the animal's own neck. Therefore, they were not {{likely to have been}} used in the initial capture of prey and Acrocanthosaurus probably led with its mouth when hunting. On the other hand, the forelimbs were able to retract towards the body very strongly. Once prey had been seized in the jaws, the heavily muscled forelimbs may have retracted, holding the prey tightly against the body and preventing escape. As the prey animal attempted <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away,</b> it would only have been further impaled on the permanently flexed claws of the first two digits. The extreme hyperextensibility of the digits may have been an adaptation allowing Acrocanthosaurus to hold struggling prey without fear of dislocation. Once the prey was trapped against the body, Acrocanthosaurus may have dispatched it with its jaws. Another possibility is that Acrocanthosaurus held its prey in its jaws, while repeatedly retracting its forelimbs, tearing large gashes with its claws.|$|E
5|$|After passing slower cars, Vettel {{began to}} resume his battle with the Ferrari drivers. Button made a pit stop on lap 22 and reemerged in fifth {{position}} behind his teammate Hamilton. The Ferrari cars began to set faster lap times {{than the rest of}} the field as Massa started <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> from Alonso and held a lead of three seconds over his teammate. Alonso responded to Massa's newfound pace by recording a new fastest lap of the race, a 1:18.075 on lap 28, having backed out to see how fast his car was in clean air, before the two drivers began to trade fastest times over the next three laps. Webber attempted to place pressure on Button in a battle for fifth place, although Button was using a defensive strategy by using his McLaren's straight-line speed advantage. De La Rosa caught up to Hülkenberg and passed him at the turn six hairpin on lap 35. Three laps later, Hamilton was instructed by McLaren to conserve fuel usage in the event they could use an aggressive fuel saving mode towards the end of the race.|$|E
5|$|Barrichello and Michael Schumacher {{started to}} {{maintain}} the gap between themselves and Montoya, and started <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> from Ralf Schumacher. Bernoldi passed Villeneuve for tenth position on lap two, while Irvine dropped to ninth one lap later after he was overtaken by Verstappen and Räikkönen. He later fell behind Alesi, Bernoldi and Villeneuve on the fourth lap. Button's engine failed which caused him to retire on lap five. Irvine lost a further three positions to Häkkinen, Panis and Frentzen one lap later. Coulthard became the third retirement of the Grand Prix after an engine failure on lap seven, which meant Verstappen inherited fifth and Räikkönen moved into sixth. Montoya had a blister {{on one of his}} rear tyres which caused him to slide under braking, and was slow exiting the Variante della Roggia chicane which allowed Barrichello to take the lead on the ninth lap. Three laps later, Alesi passed Räikkönen for sixth while Häkkinen moved into tenth after passing Bernoldi on lap 13. Irvine retired on lap 14 because he lost horsepower in his car when a cylinder in his engine stopped working. Verstappen fell to seventh after he was passed by Alesi and Räikkönen on lap 16. Yoong spun at Curva di Lesmo and fell {{to the back of the}} field.|$|E

5|$|Buemi {{moved back}} ahead of Conway {{in the battle}} for fifth, while Lotterer was impeded by an LMP2 and LMGTE car at Becketts corner and Webber was delayed by the two {{vehicles}} at Stowe corner. Jarvis came across the two slower cars at Copse corner and narrowly held off an overtaking manoeuvre from Dumas. The Audi moved across the track at Becketts corner upon coming across more slower traffic. Webber caught Lotterer and after closing up to him through Club corner. While lapping Rossiter, Webber moved {{to the front of the}} race heading into Abbey corner. Webber began <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> from Lotterer. Jarvis was delayed by Rossiter, allowing Dumas to attack but went into grass on the Wellington straight. After making contact Bruno Senna overtook Rusinov driving into Maggots corner for second place in LMP2. The first round of pit stops began after 37 minutes with Derani making a pit stop, promoting Senna into the LMP2 lead. Jarvis was the first of the overall leaders to make a pit stop for fuel and tyres and was followed by teammate Lotterer one minute later. Dumas and both Toyota cars made stops with Jani taking over from Dumas and Kamui Kobayashi switched positions with Conway. Webber stopped one lap later and Hartley climbed aboard the No. 1 Porsche.|$|E
5|$|Giovinazzi quickly caught Marciello and overtook him (with {{the help}} of DRS and drafting) {{at the start of}} lap 18 to take over the lead. Giovinazzi began <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> from Maricello. The safety car was {{deployed}} for the fourth (and final) time after Nato attempted to pass teammate King around the inside and retired from the race having been squeezed into the turn three barrier by him. The area was cleared of Nato's damaged car over the next five laps which meant the race would finish under a time limit. Giovinazzi accelerated as late as possible to limit the slipstream effect and remained the leader at the lap-25 restart despite locking-up his tyres heading into the first turn. King retired from the race following contact with Eriksson. Giovinazzi remained the leader for the remaining two laps to clinch his first, and his team's maiden, victory in the GP2 Series. Siroktin overtook Rowland for third place and clinched second position from Marciello by drafting behind him on the start/finish straight. Rowland finished in fourth place, ahead of Evans and Matsushita whom he defended from in the final two laps. Gelael, de Jong, Ghiotto, and Malja rounded out the point-scoring positions. Eriksson and King were the last of the classified finishers. The attrition race was high, with ten drivers reaching the end of the race.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen began <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> from Trulli. Although Button {{tried to}} pass Trulli on the fourth lap at the Bus Stop chicane, he ran wide and lost third {{position}} to Michael Schumacher. On that lap, Alesi was the first driver to pit for dry tyres. By {{the beginning of the}} fifth lap Häkkinen increased his lead over Trulli to ten seconds, ahead of Michael Schumacher, Button and Coulthard. Button attempted to overtake Trulli around the outside of the Bus Stop chicane, but left the inside open for Schumacher to pass him for third place. Schumacher then took second place from Trulli at La Source. Button attempted to follow Schumacher down the inside, but made contact with the latter. Trulli was sent into a spin, becoming the first retirement of the race. Button lost two positions to Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher in the incident. On the next lap Michael and Ralf Schumacher were the first leaders to pit for dry tyres, as Alesi began setting faster lap times than the front-runners. Häkkinen made a pit stop from the lead on lap seven, followed by Button, and re-emerged ahead of Coulthard to retain the lead. Coulthard made his pit stop on the following lap, re-emerging in ninth position.|$|E

5|$|Kyle Busch {{moved into}} the lead on the 18th lap, while Logano moved down the field. After {{starting}} from 14th, Dave Blaney had moved up nine positions to fifth by lap 21; Logano had moved into third by the same lap. Biffle {{moved into the}} lead on lap 23. Kenseth, who was drafting off teammate Biffle, encountered overheating problems and fell to ninth position. Biffle and Kyle Busch started to contest the lead through the fourth turn on lap 26, and the pair traded the position over the following two laps. Biffle gained the lead position on the 29th lap. By lap 33, Regan Smith and Sadler had moved into third and fourth positions respectively. Biffle had reported debris in turn two but officials could not locate it. Green flag pit stops began on lap 40; Kenseth, Logano and Kyle Busch made their pit stops on lap 42 while Biffle, Smith and Jimmie Johnson made pit stops on the following lap. After the pit stops had been completed, Biffle reclaimed the first position, while Smith moved into second and Johnson was in third. The top three drivers were followed by Sadler and Kenseth. Kyle Busch was drafting off Logano throughout lap 46 but suffered with engine problems, allowing Logano <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away.</b> By the 50th lap, the top five were Biffle, Smith, Johnson, Sadler and Kenseth.|$|E
5|$|On the 77th lap, Power and {{teammate}} Castroneves (on the Primary tires) encountered slower cars, and {{the latter}} {{took advantage of the}} situation which allowed him to overtake Power for the lead. Castroneves began <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> from Power. Ten laps later, de Silvestro's car ran out of fuel and pulled {{over to the side of}} the track onto the infield grass to retire from the race which prompted the fourth (and final) caution. Racing resumed when the pace car drove into the pit lane at the start of lap 92. Power went onto the outside lane at the entrance of the first turn, and Castroneves drove left as a blocking manoeuvre. Castroneves accelerated out of the corner's exit which caused Power to run wide. Dixon took advantage of the situation and passed Power around the outside to take over second place. The move was immediately reviewed by the IndyCar chief steward and competition president Brian Barnhart, which led to Castroneves being shown a black-flag one minute later as he was deemed as having blocked Power. Castroneves was informed that he was issued with a drive-through penalty. He opted to remain on the track for the final two laps and crossed the start-finish line first on the road.|$|E
5|$|Rousseau {{had also}} been badly wounded in the exchange, and command of Junon passed to Lieutenant Jean-Léon Emeric, who {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> from his battered adversary. As he did so the small brig Driver was well placed to intervene, but her captain, Charles Claridge, failed to engage the larger frigate, even though Latona was now rapidly approaching from the west and together they could have outnumbered and outmanoeuvred Junon. Superieure was also close by, and her captain, William Ferrie, did approach the larger French ship, his fire causing enough damage to Junons sails to prevent her escape. Taking Horatio in tow at 14:24, the brig kept Scott's frigate in the chase until sufficient repairs were complete. By 14:40 Horatio was again sailing independently and Driver finally came close enough to open fire, although at extreme range: Claridge refused to sail any closer to Junon, despite urgent signals from Horatio and Superieure. At 15:04, Superieure was again {{close enough to the}} French ship to open fire and at 15:25 Latona arrived, her presence finally convincing Claridge to enter the action. Surrounded by enemy ships and his sails in tatters, Emeric made one last effort to escape to the north, the strain of this manoeuvre causing his main and mizen masts to collapse. With both flight and resistance impossible, Junon surrendered at 15:40.|$|E
50|$|With 45 laps to go, {{the green}} {{came out and}} the field began the race to the finish. Michael Andretti once again, began <b>to</b> easily <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> from his competitors. On the 166th lap, he ran a record race lap of 229.118 mph, {{en route to a}} 15-second lead.|$|R

5|$|The third caution {{was given}} on lap ten; Tracy glanced the rear-right wheel of Servià's car heading into turn three which caused both drivers to spin and stall. De Ferran led at the lap-12 restart, ahead of Bräck and Franchitti. Bräck was {{overtaken}} by Franchitti {{for second place}} around {{the outside of the}} third turn on lap 18, while Tagliani passed Kanaan at the same corner one lap later. De Ferran continued <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> {{from the rest of the}} field and held a 7.5 second lead over Franchitti by the 30th lap. The fourth caution came out two laps later when Takagi made contact with the side of Wilson at the entrance of turn three. Both cars spun with Takagi going into the outside tire barrier and Wilson went off into the run-off area with a broken suspension. Franchitti drove into the turn six run-off area to retire with an oil pressure problem on the same lap caused by a lack of oil in his car. During the caution, most of the field made pit stops. Dixon moved from 17th to fifth and Junqueira went from 18th to seventh position because they made pit stops before the caution was displayed. Andretti moved up from 15th to tenth place. De Ferran led the lap-37 restart, and was followed by Tagliani, Bräck, Castroneves and Dixon.|$|E
5|$|Tréluyer {{was delayed}} by slower traffic, {{allowing}} Conway to overtake him for fourth position before the Audi driver ran wide at the Bus Stop chicane. Van der Garde's car's sustained a damaged mirror and was ordered by race control {{to have it}} repaired at his scheduled pit stop. Buemi closed the gap to Lucas di Grassi in Audi's No. 8 entry and attempted to pass him driving into Eau Rouge and Raidillon but di Grassi was able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> on the Kemmel Straight. Buemi moved to the outside line at Blanchimont and moved in front of di Grassi, who went through grass, at the Bus Stop chicane for second place. Marino Franchitti's No. 67 Ford made contact with Aguas's car at Les Combes but both drivers were able to continue, although Augas lost the LMGTE Am lead. Conway locked his tyres and collided heavily with Victor Shaytar's delayed No. 37 SMP Racing car going into the Bus Stop chicane while attempting {{to close the gap}} to di Grassi. Conway immediately drove into the pit lane for repairs to his car's front-end. Both Porsche cars made pit stops after 49 minutes which saw Jani taking over Lieb's driving duties while Hartley switched positions with Bernhard.|$|E
5|$|Vettel began <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>away</b> {{from the}} rest of the field. Trulli made a pit stop for a {{replacement}} nose cone at the start of the second lap after another car made contact with the rear end of his car and his front wing was removed. Webber battled Hülkenberg for eighth position but was unable to overtake the latter. Trulli made a second pit stop on the fifth lap to allow his mechanics to rectify a problem with his car's gearbox and turned off his engine to allow for repairs to occur. Vettel set a fastest lap of the race on lap five, a 1:43.055, and was three seconds ahead of Hamilton, who in turn was being caught by Alonso. It was reported by Red Bull on the following lap that eighth-placed Webber had no mechanical issues. Webber made an early pit stop on lap seven for the medium compound tyres but his crew had a minor problem fitting his left-front wheel which meant he was stationary for 7.9 seconds, and rejoined in 18th position. Rosberg made a similar stop on the next lap but he overshot his pit stall and rejoined in 19th place.|$|E
