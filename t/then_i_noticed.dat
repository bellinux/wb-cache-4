25|$|The 29th had dawned calm, {{but while}} we were still trying to persuade {{ourselves}} that the tragedy was over and the volcano had exhausted its bowels, at about 8 o'clock, we heard a crash and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that smoke was rising {{from the point of}} the island that looks towards east. The smoke spread very gradually as far as the crater of the volcano, while there were many whiffs issuing from points in the direction of another headland. I realized that the island had opened in these places and fearing that, if a crater should open below the water, an explosion might follow, much more formidable than the preceding ones, I mounted a horse and retired permanently to the Sanctuary of Caysasay.|$|E
500|$|Advised of her failing health, Bishop Ignace Bourget visited Cadron-Jetté on April 4, 1864, and {{administered}} {{to her the}} last rites. Rosalie Cadron-Jetté died shortly thereafter, during {{the early hours of}} April 5, 1864. Her death was witnessed by Sister Marie-des-Saints-Anges, who said this of the occasion: [...] "I witnessed her blessed death. I was sitting vigil with our good sister Sainte-Béatrix. Around 2 a.m. she made {{the sign of the cross}} and asked us to recite the Litanies of the Virgin Mary; then she arranged herself as if to prepare for sleep, then in a high pitched voice she said: O my Jesus! <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> she was getting weaker; we brought the light closer to her and realized she had already passed over to a better life." ...|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{was five}} years old, in 1963, her mother, Madonna Ciccone, {{died of breast cancer}} at the age of30. Months before this, Madonna noticed changes in her mother's {{behavior}} and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, but did not understand the reasons. Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her arms around her mother tenderly. [...] "I remember feeling stronger than she was", Madonna recalled, [...] "I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child." [...] Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. [...] "There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion.... I saw my mother, looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that my mother's mouth looked funny. It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up. In that awful moment, I began to understand what I had lost forever. The final image of my mother, at once peaceful yet grotesque, haunts me today also." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{string of}} covered waggons passes by. I turn {{and see a}} number of men sitting inside and looking almost as cheerful as a beanfeast in Epping Forest. They make facetious gestures. They have a subdued sing-song going on. But one of them looks a little sick, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> not very {{obtrusive}} bandages. [...] "Sitting-up cases," [...] my guide explains.|$|R
40|$|Hiking {{towards the}} {{saltmarsh}} at dusk, I pause, confused, as the footpath seems to disappear {{into a long}} stretch of shallow muddy water, shining as it reflects the light of the setting sun. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> a line of stepping stones, visible only because their rough texture just ruffles the bright smooth surface of the water. And I set my pace to the rhythm of the stones, and walk on across the marsh to the sand dunes beyond. Reading the watery marshland is a conversation with the past, with people I know nothing about, except that they laid the stones that shape my stride, and probably shared my dislike of wet feet. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The {{illness was}} {{especially}} hard for Haydn because {{the flow of}} fresh musical ideas waiting {{to be worked out}} as compositions (something he could no longer do) continued unabated. His biographer Dies reported a conversation from 1806: said [...] "I must have something to do—usually musical ideas are pursuing me, to the point of torture, I cannot escape them, they stand like walls before me. If its an allegro that pursues me, my pulse keeps beating faster, I can get no sleep. If its an adagio, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> my pulse beating slowly. My imagination plays on me as if I were a clavier." [...] Haydn smiled, the blood rushed to his face, and he said [...] "I am really just a living clavier." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> the {{twinkle in}} his eyes. He was {{laughing}} at me.|$|E
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that Superstition {{stood in}} the light of the doorway looking down on us.|$|E
60|$|We talked {{along for}} half an hour, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that he looked tired, and spoke of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "By the way," [...] he asked, as, {{after dinner}} was over, {{he was walking}} up and down the quarterdeck, talking to James, [...] "have you and Lieutenant Horton met before? I thought you seemed to know each other when I came up, but, since <b>then</b> <b>I</b> have <b>noticed</b> that, while all the other {{officers}} of the ship have been chatting with you, he has kept aloof." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Ministry {{frontman}} Al Jourgensen, [...] "We {{hung out}} at Burroughs's house {{one time in}} '93. So he decides to shoot up heroin and he takes out this utility belt full of syringes. Huge, old-fashioned ones from the '50s or something. Now, I {{have no idea how}} an 80 year old guy finds a vein, but {{he knew what he was}} doing. So we're all laying around high and stuff and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> in the pile of mail on the coffee table that there's a letter from the White House. I said 'Hey, this looks important.' and he replies 'Nah, it's probably just junk mail.' Well, I open the letter and it's from President Clinton inviting Burroughs to the White House for a poetry reading. I said 'Wow, do you have any idea how big this is!?' So he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who our current president was." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> first <b>noticed</b> {{that another}} person {{was in the}} hut, a slim young girl, who had been seated against the wall {{on the other side}} of the fire, {{partially}} hid by the shadows. She had my leather belt, with the revolver in its case, and my hunting-knife attached, and the few articles I had had in my pockets, on her lap. Taking up the pouch, she handed it to him, and he clutched it with a strange eagerness.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that a big, blue-checked cloth {{was spread}} on the parapet before me, over the parapet of heaven. I {{wondered}} why it hung there.|$|E
60|$|Feb. 10.--The first chirping, almost singing, {{of a bird}} to-day. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> {{a couple}} of honey-bees spirting and humming about the open window in the sun.|$|E
6000|$|I turned, and saw my uncle. He was {{disguised}} in {{a costume}} of reddish-brown cloth. [...] "Golf here?" [...] said I, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> the tricycle. [...] "A vagrom man on wheels!" ...|$|E
60|$|I almost {{wished it}} were night to try. I wanted {{to imagine the}} trees cosy. They seemed now in the underworld. Between the lemon trees, beside the path, were little orange trees, and dozens of oranges hanging like hot coals in the twilight. When I warm my hands at them the Signore breaks me off one twig after another, till I {{have a bunch of}} burning oranges among dark leaves, a heavy bouquet. Looking down the Hades of the lemon-house, the many ruddy-clustered oranges beside the path remind me of the lights of a village along the lake at night, while the pale lemons above are the stars. There is a subtle, {{exquisite}} scent of lemon flowers. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> a citron. He hangs heavy and bloated upon so small a tree, that he seems a dark green enormity. There is a great host of lemons overhead, half-visible, a swarm of ruddy oranges by the paths, and here and there a fat citron. It is almost like being under the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} better to buy one from those men, Brenon, because the fact of our being strangers would not <b>then</b> be <b>noticed.</b> <b>I</b> want one rowing boat, as fast a craft as you can pick out.|$|R
50|$|He says it {{took five}} years to write the script.I work on them really slowly. I {{do a lot of}} stand-up, so time's at a minimum, and then, after two years I looked at it and thought it was the wrong thing I wanted to do - so I started again, and got it done within {{a year and a half}} after that. <b>I</b> <b>then</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>I</b> had two stories mixed into one, so I had to pick one story over the other - that's {{probably}} why it took five years, I had to realise that... I wanted the second film to have a broader appeal, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> could get more money to make it - so it would be a better looking picture. It's not a film about films - there's not a lot of film jokes in it. I'm really hoping people discover it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sad?" [...] said he. It was <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> {{that he had}} a {{cut across}} his temple, red and barely healed. [...] "Do you reckon your Polly Ann would give me a little mite to eat?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{began to}} {{distinguish}} now a deeper blackness in the black, a vague {{outline of a}} hunched-up figure. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> {{the opening of the}} place was darkened by two more black heads. My hand tightened on my stick.|$|E
6000|$|... "Terribly scared, madam," [...] {{answered}} the Lion, [...] "for at first I {{thought you were}} going to have a fit. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> you were trying to overcome me by the power of your eye, and your glance was so fierce and penetrating that I shook with fear." ...|$|E
60|$|The Carter {{was hard}} put {{to keep the}} pace at which we walked (he {{told me that he}} had eaten nothing that day), but the Carpenter, lean and hungry, his grey and ragged {{overcoat}} flapping mournfully in the breeze, swung on in a long and tireless stride which reminded me strongly of the plains wolf or coyote. Both kept their eyes upon the pavement as they walked and talked, and every now and then one or the other would stoop and pick something up, never missing the stride the while. I thought it was cigar and cigarette stumps they were collecting, and for some time took no <b>notice.</b> <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> did <b>notice.</b>|$|R
60|$|The stone-breaker, who had {{not broken}} a {{fragment}} since we began to converse, then did as follows. He raised himself by poising his finger on his hammer, and took his coat, on {{which he had been}} seated, over his arm. He then backed to an easier part of the bank than that by which I had come down, keeping his dark goggles silently upon me all the time, and then shouldered his hammer, suddenly turned, ascended, and was gone. His face was so small, and his goggles were so large, that he left me wholly uninformed as to his countenance; but he left me a profound impression that the curved legs I had seen from behind as he vanished, were the legs of an old postboy. It was not until <b>then</b> that <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> he had been working by a grass-grown milestone, which looked like a tombstone erected over the grave of the London road.|$|R
60|$|I thought I {{would watch}} for the Count's return, {{and for a long}} time sat doggedly at the window. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> began to <b>notice</b> that there were some quaint little specks {{floating}} in the rays of the moonlight. They were like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more fully the aerial gambolling.|$|R
6000|$|There it was, {{the same}} as ever. I lifted the gate-latch; the gate was locked. We ran to the carriage-gate; that was locked too. Just <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> a placard on the fence; it was not printed, but the {{lettering}} was large, apparently made with ink and a brush. It read: ...|$|E
60|$|THE WOMAN. Yes: I {{took it from}} a {{man that}} met me. I thought God sent him to me. I rode here joyfully {{thinking}} so {{all the time to}} myself. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that the child was like lead in my arms. God would never have been so cruel as to send me the horse to disappoint me like that.|$|E
60|$|Presently I looked up. The {{woman stood}} over us, water {{streaming}} from her garments, staring like {{one in a}} dream at Leo's face, smothered as it was with blood running from a deep cut in his head. Even <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> how stately and beautiful she was. Now she seemed to awake and, glancing at the robes that clung to her splendid shape, said something to her companion, then turned and ran towards the cliff.|$|E
60|$|By my {{authority}} as executive I threw Merlin into prison--the same cell I had occupied myself. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> gave public <b>notice</b> by herald and trumpet that I should be busy with affairs {{of state for}} a fortnight, but {{about the end of}} that time I would take a moment's leisure and blow up Merlin's stone tower by fires from heaven; in the meantime, whoso listened to evil reports about me, let him beware. Furthermore, I would perform but this one miracle at this time, and no more; if it failed to satisfy and any murmured, I would turn the murmurers into horses, and make them useful. Quiet ensued.|$|R
60|$|Helplessness, Impotence: Shrugging the shoulders.--When a man {{wishes to}} show that he cannot do {{something}}, or prevent something being done, he often raises with a quick movement both shoulders. At the same time, if the whole gesture is completed, he bends his elbows closely inwards, raises his open hands, turning them outwards, with the fingers separated. The head is often thrown a little on one side; the eyebrows are elevated, and this causes wrinkles across the forehead. The mouth is generally opened. I may mention, in order to show how unconsciously the features are thus acted on, that though I had often intentionally shrugged my shoulders to observe how my arms were placed, I was not at all aware that my eyebrows were raised and mouth opened, until I looked at myself in a glass; and since <b>then</b> <b>I</b> have <b>noticed</b> the same movements in the faces of others. In the accompanying Plate VI., figs. 3 and 4, Mr. Rejlander has successfully acted the gesture of shrugging the shoulders.|$|R
5000|$|Three songs I {{wrote for}} Blind Guardian. And when <b>I</b> <b>noticed,</b> {{when they were}} done, that the songs were very similar to old Blind Guardian stuff, more back-to-the-roots, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> {{that it would be}} big problem to present these songs to my ex-band members, because, OK, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> was still in the band, but I knew when I would play the songs to them they would say: [...] "Hey, this is {{something}} we already did ten years ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, I boomed along another {{hundred and}} fifty million miles, and got up abreast his shoulder, as you may say. I was feeling pretty fine, I tell you; but just <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> the officer of the deck come {{to the side and}} hoist his glass in my direction. Straight off I heard him sing out--"Below there, ahoy! Shake her up, shake her up! Heave on a hundred million billion tons of brimstone!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{a moment}} tug and ship hung {{motionless}} {{in a crowd}} of moving shipping, and then the terrific strain that evil, stony-hearted brute would always put on everything, tore the towing-chock clean out. The tow-rope surged over, snapping the iron stanchions of the head-rail one after another {{as if they had}} been sticks of sealing-wax. It was only <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that in order to have a better view over our heads, Maggie had stepped upon the port anchor as it lay flat on the forecastle deck.|$|E
60|$|When he {{was gone}} I stole out to examine his tracks. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> {{for the first time}} that the old path near the deadfall was getting moss-grown; a faint new path began to show among the alders. Some warning was there in the trap, and with cunning {{instinct}} all the wood dwellers turned aside, giving a wide berth to what they felt was dangerous but could not understand. The new path joined the old again, beyond the brook, and followed it straight to the river.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was some}} time ago," [...] replied Ojo. [...] "He was {{trailing}} along {{at the end}} and throwing twigs at the squirrels in the trees. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> went to talk to Betsy and Trot, and just now <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> he was gone." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>then</b> <b>noticed</b> at the {{apparent}} descent rate and closure to the runway environment the aircraft {{looked as though}} it was going to impact the approach lights mounted on piers in the SF Bay. The aircraft made a fairly drastic-looking pull up in the last few feet and it appeared and sounded as if they had applied maximum thrust. However the descent path they were on continued and the thrust applied didn't appear to come soon enough to prevent impact. The tail cone and empennageof the 777 impacted the bulkhead seawall and departed the airplane and the main landing gear sheared off instantly. United Flight 885 first officer ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} we had come down again, and had at last sat quietly down, that <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> Polly's face, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> saw at once {{that she was not}} looking at all herself. She was very pale, and looked, I thought, anxious and flurried.|$|R
