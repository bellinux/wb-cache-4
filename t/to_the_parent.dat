5|$|Unlike {{in higher}} animals, where {{parthenogenesis}} is rare, asexual reproduction may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem tubers in potato is one example. Particularly in arctic or alpine habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers by animals are rare, plantlets or bulbs, may develop instead of flowers, replacing sexual reproduction with asexual reproduction and {{giving rise to}} clonal populations genetically identical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent.</b> This {{is one of several}} types of apomixis that occur in plants. Apomixis can also happen in a seed, producing a seed that contains an embryo genetically identical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although their ranges overlap substantially, {{hybridisation}} between goldcrests and firecrests {{seems to}} be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns. Even in aviary studies in which a female goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male firecrest, the chicks were never raised by the mixed pair, {{and appeared to be}} poorly adapted compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> species.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{different}} genera of oviraptorids {{have been}} found on or near elongatoolithid nests indicating that oviraptorid parents would brood on their eggs, most likely for extended periods of time. There is some {{evidence to suggest that}} oviraptorid and troodontid eggs were cared for by the father, perhaps in a polygamous system. Given the large size of eggs relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent,</b> a mother would only lay two eggs at a time, so the eggs of a single nest may have been contributed by multiple females.|$|E
5|$|On top of {{the failure}} of the franchises to approve the spin-off, a series of {{lawsuits}} complicated the divestiture. Two legal challenges <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> company were filed by investors, one in Pillsbury's home state of Minnesota and another in the state where it was incorporated, Delaware, in which the legality of the stock tender plan was questioned. These three events eventually forced Pillsbury to give up its bid to fend off Grand Metropolitan and agree to be acquired in November 1988 for a sum of US$5.7 billion.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction is {{by either}} asexual or sexual means. Parts of the coral may get {{detached}} from the colony by a storm or other means, {{and some of these}} fragments may end up in suitable locations to grow into new colonies which will be genetically identical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> colony. This fragmentation is probably the most frequent method of reproduction. Alternatively, certain pores called ampullae contain polyps that bud off short-lived, jellyfish-like medusae, which separate from the colony. They produce gametes which, after fertilisation, develop into planula larvae. These drift with the currents as part of the zooplankton before settling out and developing into new colonies.|$|E

5|$|Telopea oreades needs a well-drained {{location}} as well {{as reliable}} moisture to thrive. Soil with some clay content is beneficial. It is more shade-tolerant than the more popular New South Wales waratah, preferring part-shade but tolerating sunny aspects. It tolerates moderate frosts. Plants can be hard-pruned—lopping old stems and branches can rejuvenate mature plants. Plants can benefit from low-phosphorus fertilizer applied in spring and autumn. Propagation is by seed, the germination rates of which fall significantly after several months' storage unless refrigerated, or by cuttings of new growth that has just hardened. Cultivars must be propagated by cutting to make daughter plants identical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent.</b>|$|E
5|$|The NFA {{claimed that}} the {{diversion}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> company violated the beverage contracts between various parties. Negotiations between the two entities eventually failed, {{which led to a}} class action suit being filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Burger King Corporation, Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper on behalf of all Burger King franchises in the United States in May 2009. In the filing, the NFA claimed the three defendants were in violation of a 1999 beverage contract that set specific beverage syrup usage goals. The four parties settled shortly after the filing when Burger King agreed to seek advertising funds from other sources.|$|E
5|$|The United States' {{declaration}} of independence from Great Britain in 1776 led criollos (Spanish peoples born in the Americas) to believe that revolution and independence from Spain were feasible. Between 1775 and 1783, the American patriots of the Thirteen Colonies waged the American Revolutionary War against both the local loyalists and the Kingdom of Great Britain, eventually establishing a popular government {{in the place of}} the British monarchy. The fact that Spain aided the colonies in their struggle against Britain weakened the idea {{that it would be a}} crime to end one's allegiance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> state.|$|E

5|$|For several centuries, {{education}} {{at one of}} the Inns of Chancery was the first step towards becoming a barrister. A student would first join one of the Inns of Chancery, where he would be taught in the form of moots and rote learning. He would also be taught by Readers sent from the Inn of Court that his Inn of Chancery was attached to, who would preside over the moots and discuss cases with the students. At the end of each legal term, particularly promising students would be transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> Inn of Court and begin the next stage of their education. By 1461 there were approximately 100 students studying at the Inns of Chancery at any one time.|$|E
5|$|He {{began his}} minor league career in Class A for the Bellingham Giants. After an {{unsuccessful}} {{year at the}} plate the Giants tried to convert Nathan into a pitcher, but he refused and left to return to Stony Brook for a year, graduating {{with a degree in}} business management. He gave more thought to his future in baseball, however, and after graduation decided to return to the Giants organization and developed into a standout pitching prospect. After a season with the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes, he pitched for both the A and AA levels for (the San Jose Giants and Shreveport Captains) in 1998 as a starter. During his tenure with San Jose he started 22games with an ERA of 3.32 and 118 strikeouts, leading the Class A Giants to the California League championship. Promoted to AA Shreveport in 1999, he pitched in only two games before being promoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> club in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Nobody {{could call}} {{the whole nation}} a criminal, nor the {{individuals}} that have aired their political views. If the right of conquest belongs by right to the conquering country, {{it would be fair}} for Spain to quit resisting the French and submit to them, by the same principles for which it is expected that the Americans submit themselves to the peoples of Pontevedra. The reason and the rule must be equal for everybody. Here there are no conquerors or conquered; here there are only Spaniards. The Spaniards of Spain have lost their land. The Spaniards of America are trying to save theirs. Let the ones from Spain deal with themselves as they can; do not worry, we American Spaniards know what we want and where we go. So I suggest we vote: that we replace the Viceroy with a new authority that will be subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> state if it is saved from the French, and independent if Spain is finally subjugated.|$|E
