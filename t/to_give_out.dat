5|$|Although Poniatowski {{protested the}} First Partition of the Commonwealth (1772), he was {{powerless}} {{to do anything}} about it. He considered abdication, but decided against it. During the Partition Sejm of 1773–1775, in which Russia was represented by ambassador Otto von Stackelberg, with no help forthcoming from abroad and the armies of the partitioning powers occupying Warsaw to compel the Sejm by force of arms, no alternative was available save submission to their will. Eventually Poniatowski and the Sejm acceded to the partition treaty; at the same time, several other reforms were passed. The Cardinal Laws were confirmed and guaranteed by the partitioning powers. Royal power was restricted, as the king lost the power <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>out</b> titles, and positions of military officers, ministers and senators, the starostwo territories, and Crown lands would be awarded through an auction. The Sejm also created two notable institutions: the Permanent Council, a main governmental body in continuous operation, and the Commission of National Education. The partitioners intended the Council to be easier to control than the unruly Sejms, and indeed it remained {{under the influence of the}} Russian Empire. Nevertheless, it was a significant improvement in the Commonwealth governance. The new legislation was guaranteed by the Russian Empire, giving it another excuse to interfere in Commonwealth politics if the legislation it favored was changed.|$|E
5|$|Fame premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre on May 12, 1980. MGM, which {{released}} Fame through United Artists, {{gave the}} film a platform release release which involved releasing {{the film in}} select cities before expanding distribution in the following weeks. On May 16, 1980, the film premiered at the Cinerama Dome Theatre in Hollywood, California, and opened in limited release in New York, Toronto and Los Angeles. MGM stated that the limited theatrical run was meant to generate strong word-of-mouth support from audiences and mainstream film critics. The studio was especially concerned with the film's cast of then-unknown actors. MGM spent more than $2 million on an advertising campaign that placed emphasis on the film's music. The studio also allowed select theatre chains <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>out</b> free tickets for special screenings. Fame was released nationwide on June 20, 1980. It grossed $21,202,829 in North America, becoming the thirty-second highest-grossing film of 1980.|$|E

The UN granted Nicaragua a month's worth of food supply, but officials feared that {{this would not be}} enough. The government of Cuba announced that they would send 12,000 construction workers as well as 2,000 teachers, doctors, and officials to Nicaragua. Canada donated $220,000via the League of Red Cross Societies. To prevent an epidemic of diseases such as typhoid fever, the Health Ministry started a program <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>out</b> vaccines which costs $5.1million.

25|$|The {{shift toward}} {{the use of}} these {{receipts}} as a means of payment took place in the mid-17th century, as the price revolution, when relatively rapid gold inflation, was causing a re-assessment of how money worked. The goldsmith-bankers of London began <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>out</b> the receipts as payable to the bearer of the document rather than the original depositor.

25|$|Small {{denomination}} {{currency and}} particularly coins are sometimes {{difficult to come}} by in Argentina, especially in Buenos Aires. The problem has developed to a stage in which some shop owners will not sell items if the transaction involves giving the purchaser change in coins. It has also been exacerbated by ATMs, which tend <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>out</b> only 100 peso notes, and by bus companies, some of which will take only coins in payment and sell these at a 5–10% markup {{on the black market}} rather than depositing them at banks. This situation has improved in the years following the Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002). Nowadays nearly all bus lines in Buenos Aires have a SUBE (Sistema Único de Boleto Electrónico; Unified Electronic Ticket System) smartcard reader, allowing passengers to pay electronically without coins.|$|E

At the same time, he also counselled the people and explained to them the benefits of serving in the military.
