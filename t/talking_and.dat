5|$|Much of the {{cinematography}} {{was shot}} at night, because Bakshi felt that the daylight made the scenes less believable.

However, the camera man was not around to capture these events, so Bakshi filmed them himself. When Bakshi excitedly told William A.

5|$|Doink the Clown had annoyed Bam Bam Bigelow {{throughout}} October and November {{with such}} pranks as throwing water and confetti {{on him and}} dumping a pail of water on Bigelow's on-screen girlfriend Luna Vachon. He also tied a tripwire across the aisle during one of Bigelow's matches; after Bigelow fell over the wire, Doink attacked him with a broom. Bigelow responded by coming to the ring during one of Doink's matches and destroying Doink's toy wagon. The character of Doink was played by several wrestlers, who occasionally appeared at the same time. The match booked for Survivor Series advertised Bigelow teaming with Bastion Booger, who portrayed an overweight and dirty glutton, and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu), a team of Samoans who were portrayed as savages, to face four Doinks. To promote the match, Doink appeared on the video wall {{that was part of}} the set during Bigelow's matches leading up to the event. The wall used a split screen to show multiple Doinks <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> laughing at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Modell said {{he would}} look outside the Browns {{organization}} for a new coach, a break from past hirings that drew from the team's own ranks. Peter Hadhazy, who Modell had hired as the Browns' first general manager, recommended a 45-year-old New Orleans Saints receivers coach named Sam Rutigliano. After an interview before Christmas in which Modell and Rutigliano spent hours <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> watching game film in Modell's basement, the owner named him head coach on December 27, 1977. An affable, charismatic man with an even temper, Rutigliano was {{a stark contrast to}} Gregg. Sipe immediately flourished under Rutigliano, racking up 21 touchdowns and 2,906 passing yards during the 1978 season, when the NFL moved to a 16-game schedule. His prime targets were Reggie Rucker, a veteran receiver the Browns signed in 1975, and Ozzie Newsome, a rookie tight end out of Alabama who the Browns drafted with a pick acquired in the Phipps trade. Cleveland won its first three games, but poor defense dashed the team's playoff chances and the Browns finished with an 8–8 record.|$|E
5|$|Canucks Head Coach Alain Vigneault had {{reportedly}} recommended Lapierre to General Manager Mike Gillis, having coached Lapierre in the QMJHL. Upon {{his arrival}} in Vancouver, Lapierre's reputation as an agitator was addressed by Vigneault and {{he was asked to}} reduce activity in between whistles, such as trash <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> unnecessary hits. Lapierre scored his first goal as a Canuck on March 16, 2011, in a 4–2 win against the Colorado Avalanche. While the Canucks originally acquired Lapierre with the intention of playing him on the fourth line, he soon moved up to the third with the injury of Manny Malhotra late in the season. Between Montreal, Anaheim and Vancouver, he finished the season with six goals and six assists over 78 games. Centring the third line with wingers Raffi Torres and Jannik Hansen during the 2011 playoffs, Lapierre added three goals and five points over 25 games. He helped Vancouver reach the Stanley Cup Finals {{for the first time in}} 17 years. During the Finals, Lapierre scored the only goal of Game 5 against the Boston Bruins, helping Vancouver to a 1–0 win. With a 3–2 lead in the series, the Canucks went on to lose the next two contests, losing the Stanley Cup in seven games. Set to become an restricted free agent in the off-season, Lapierre was re-signed by Vancouver to a two-year, $2 million contract on June 27, 2011.|$|E

5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are already so many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E
