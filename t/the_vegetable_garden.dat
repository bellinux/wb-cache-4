25|$|Then {{the trio}} of Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who, and Mrs Which arrive. They charge Meg with rescuing Charles Wallace from IT, because only Meg has a strong enough bond with him. Their father had last seen Charles Wallace {{when he was a}} baby and Calvin had only just met him. They each give her a gift. Mrs Whatsit gives Meg her love. Mrs Who quotes to Meg a passage from the Bible about God {{choosing}} the foolish of the world to confound the wise, and the weak to defeat the strong (1st Corinthians 1:27-29). Mrs Which tells Meg that she has one thing that IT does not have. Upon arriving at the building where IT is housed, Charles Wallace is still there under IT's influence. Meg realizes that the one thing she has that IT does not is love. She focuses all her love at Charles Wallace and is able to free him from IT's control. Mrs Who, Mrs Which and Mrs Whatsit tesser the Murrys and Calvin back to Earth. In <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>garden</b> they are reunited with Mrs. Murry and the twins. Mrs Whatsit says that, although she and the others like the spectacle of the family reuniting, they have to go somewhere. Before Mrs Whatsit finishes her sentence, she and the others disappear.|$|E

The widowed mother rabbit cautions her young against entering <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>garden</b> of a man named Mr. McGregor, telling them: [...] "your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor". Her three daughters obediently refrain from entering the garden, going down the lane to pick blackberries, but her rebellious son Peter enters the garden to snack on some vegetables. Peter ends up eating more than is good for him and goes looking for parsley to cure his stomach ache. Peter is spotted by Mr. McGregor and loses his jacket and shoes while trying to escape. He hides in a watering can in a shed, but then has to run away again when Mr. McGregor finds him, and ends up completely lost. After sneaking past a cat, Peter sees the gate where he entered the garden from a distance and heads for it, despite being spotted and chased by Mr. McGregor again. With difficulty he wriggles under the gate, and escapes from the garden, but he spots his abandoned clothing being used to dress Mr. McGregor's scarecrow. After returning home, a sick Peter is sent to bed by his mother, while his well-behaved sisters receive a sumptuous dinner of milk and berries as opposed to Peter's supper of chamomile tea.|$|E

ABSTRACT: The objective {{of this study is}} to contribute to a better knowledge of the agromorphological diversity of Cleome gynandra L. of the West of Burkina Faso. Hundred accessions, collected in <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>gardens</b> and <b>the</b> natural populations of the sahelo-soudan zone and the soudan zone of Burkina Faso, was evaluated according to a Latinized Alpha-Plan design. Observations and Biometrical measurements were carried on 23 variables. The study revealed a great agromorphological variability within the accessions from <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>gardens</b> and those collected in the natural populations. 17 characters- 11 quantitatives and 6 qualitatives discriminate the studied accessions. Highly significant differences at 1 % were observed between the accessions of the two climatic zones and between the accessions from <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>gardens</b> and those collected in the natural populations. The agronomical performances of the accessions from the sahelo-soudan zone are higher than those of the accessions from the soudan zone. Also, the performances of the accessions from <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>gardens</b> are higher than those from the natural populations. Several positive correlations were observed. The study of the structuring of the diversity of the accessions revealed two great sets. The first set is mainly constituted with cultivated accessions and accessions from the sahelo-soudan zone.

2500|$|The Murry {{farmhouse}} - Somewhere in Connecticut. Starting {{and ending}} point {{for each of}} the books in the Time Quartet, plus An Acceptable Time. The Murry farmhouse, nearly two centuries old as of A Wrinkle in Time, contains a pantry that has been converted into Dr. Kate Murry's laboratory. [...] As an adolescent, Meg Murry has her bedroom in the attic. Outside, a vegetable garden is tended by Sandy and Dennys Murry, who eventually grow Christmas trees instead once they go off to college. After the twins move away and the trees are sold, their parents reinstate <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>garden</b> on a smaller scale. At the edge of the property is a stone wall, inhabited by a snake called Louise the Larger, and a glacial boulder called the [...] "star-watching rock". In later years the house features an indoor swimming pool that connects to a [...] "time gate", linking the present to a time approximately three thousand years earlier, when the area was inhabited by the fictional People of the Wind. Beyond this rural setting, small, worn-down mountains can be seen (based on Litchfield Hills), which according to An Acceptable Time were larger and snow-capped three thousand years ago. The house and the nearby star-watching rock have parallels in both the Austin family series of books and in L'Engle's actual Connecticut home, Crosswicks, a farmhouse dating back to 1770. Like the similar house owned by the Austin family, the Murry house lies outside a small village, served by a regional high school. Unlike the Austins' village, however, the one near the Murry home is not named in the books.|$|E

A foottrail that led down {{the wall of the}} big canyon invited him, and he proceeded to follow it. A water-pipe, usually above ground, paralleled the trail, which he concluded led upstream to the bed of the creek. The wall of the canon was several hundred feet from top to bottom, and magnificent were the untouched trees that the place was plunged in perpetual shade. He measured with his eye spruces five and six feet in diameter and redwoods even larger. One such he passed, a twister that was at least ten or eleven feet through. The trail led straight to a small dam where was the intake for the pipe that watered <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>garden.</b> Here, beside the stream, were alders and laurel trees, and he walked through fern-brakes higher than his head.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Rural sociology. Today, when fresh, canned, and frozen vegetables are plentiful and taken for granted, <b>the</b> home <b>vegetable</b> <b>garden</b> is regarded as something between a hobby and a luxury. But in the Great Depression of the 1930 s, <b>the</b> household <b>vegetable</b> <b>garden,</b> which was primarily the responsibility of the farm woman, was an engine that helped many rural families pull through tough economic times. <b>The</b> home <b>vegetable</b> <b>garden</b> is an ideal place from which to explore women's agency, because it is not only a gendered site on the farmstead where women, particularly during this time period, were able to develop skills and knowledge to enable them to feed their families, but it also was a site that enabled them to participate in the economic welfare of the farm. This study examines <b>the</b> Depression-era <b>vegetable</b> <b>garden</b> and its value in helping to keep farm families off relief rolls and remain relatively self-sufficient. It also examines the role of the professional women - Extension home demonstration agents - who worked with farm women to develop and improve their gardening and canning capabilities. It documents the material culture of <b>the</b> Depression-era <b>vegetable</b> <b>garden</b> in an attempt to make readers aware of the often taken-for-granted tools, skills, and knowledge that women needed to grow groceries in the garden...|$|R
