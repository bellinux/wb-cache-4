5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa (dwarf forms) – Rod Parsons of Carawah Nursery in Victoria has two red-styled fairly compact dwarf forms, one (all {{serrated}} – slow-growing, possibly collina) {{growing to}} 1m, the (leaf ends serrated only, faster-growing) other 1.5m – and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>others</b> reported but not named.|$|E
5|$|As well as plant based poisons, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>others</b> {{that are}} made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{complaints}} from bar owners about {{their inability to}} obtain liability insurance, the state passed legislation in 1987 to limit liability to cases where the server could have realistically known that the patron was underage or intoxicated, and to limit lawsuits to types of injuries that are foreseeable. The act also instituted the legal standard of comparative negligence in these cases, wherein the monetary damages against a licensed establishment can be reduced if <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>others</b> who are also negligent (e.g. the patron, other bars). Additional legislation passed in 1987 substantially limited the liability of social hosts for adult guests.|$|E

5|$|The executioner was masked and disguised, {{and there}} is debate over his identity. The commissioners {{approached}} Richard Brandon, the common hangman of London, but he refused, at least at first, despite being offered £200. It is possible he relented and undertook the commission after being threatened with death, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>others</b> who have been named as potential candidates, including George Joyce, William Hulet and Hugh Peters. The clean strike, confirmed by {{an examination of the}} king's body at Windsor in 1813, suggests that the execution was carried out by an experienced headsman.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{whistles}} described generate nearly pure tones {{that can}} be heard. The mountain tones discussed above are examples of tones that are inaudible because they are below the frequency range of humans. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>others</b> whose sound levels are below the audible range of humans. For example, the vortex street behind a stick underwater might radiate at audible frequencies but not sufficiently to be heard by a Scuba diver. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>others</b> that are both below audible frequencies and below audible levels.|$|E
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> six-sided dice {{that are}} mono-colored called Dragonkin {{that are not}} {{considered}} units. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> ten-sided dice that are mono-colored called artifacts that are a type of magic item.

25|$|A prototypical {{example of}} an {{algorithm}} is the Euclidean algorithm to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers; an example (<b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>others)</b> is described by the flow chart above and as an example in a later section.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} rule, al- may be prefixed to any ism, {{regardless}} of gender, plurality, grammatical case, etc. However, this rule has some pathological caveats. That is, {{there are some}} nouns that al- may never be prefixed to, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>others</b> that al- must always be prefixed to.|$|E
25|$|Outdoor {{facilities}} are mainly {{based in the}} Riverside Sporting Ground, within a reasonable walking distance and bordering the Tay, although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>others</b> - such as tennis courts - spread throughout the main campus.

25|$|There {{are many}} campgrounds on Fraser Island with varying {{amenities}} and access. The main camping areas are: Dundubara Campground, , Waddy Point campground, Central Station Tent Sites, Waddy Beach (tent only campsites), Cornwells Break (large group site), One Tree Rocks camp zone (Eurong-One Tree Rocks), however <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>others.</b> Permits {{are required for}} camping and also for vehicle access.|$|E
25|$|Huxley {{was always}} able to write well, and was ever willing to address the public on {{scientific}} topics. Well over half his books are addressed to an educated general audience, and he wrote often in periodicals and newspapers. The most extensive bibliography of Huxley lists some of these ephemeral articles, though <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>others</b> unrecorded.|$|E
25|$|Euler angles are {{one way to}} {{represent}} orientations. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>others,</b> {{and it is possible}} to change to and from other conventions. Three parameters are always required to describe orientations in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space. They can be given in several ways, Euler angles being one of them; see charts on SO(3) for others.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} types of mass analyzers, using either static or dynamic fields, and {{magnetic}} or electric fields, but all operate {{according to the above}} differential equation. Each analyzer type has its strengths and weaknesses. Many mass spectrometers use two or more mass analyzers for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). In addition to the more common mass analyzers listed below, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>others</b> designed for special situations.|$|E
25|$|As usual Preah Khan is {{oriented}} toward the east, {{so this was}} the main entrance, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>others</b> {{at each of the}} cardinal points. Each entrance has a causeway over the moat with nāga-carrying devas and asuras similar to those at Angkor Thom; Glaize considered this an indication that the city element of Preah Khan was more significant than those of Ta Prohm or Banteay Kdei.|$|E
25|$|Huygens {{investigated}} {{the use of}} lenses in projectors. He is credited as {{the inventor of the}} magic lantern, described in correspondence of 1659. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>others</b> to whom such a lantern device has been attributed, such as Giambattista della Porta, and Cornelis Drebbel: the point at issue is the use of a lens for better projection. Athanasius Kircher has also been credited for that.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to design <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> factors which affect racing results. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> 12 Metre designs which are fast boats but struggled {{to reach their}} full potential due to inadequate crewing or lack of preparation or bad luck {{or a combination of}} both.|$|R

25|$|There {{are persons}} in every community—often deeply devout—to whom any {{version of the}} Judaeo-Christian Bible is offensive. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>others</b> whose reverence for the Holy Scriptures demands private study or {{reflection}} and to whom public reading or recitation is sacrilegious.... To such persons {{it is not the}} fact of using the Bible in the public schools, nor the content of any particular version, that is offensive, but {{the manner in which it}} is used.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{depressions}} {{by which}} the plateau is intersected transversely, the principal ones are the Gualichu, south of the Río Negro, the Maquinchao and Valcheta (through which previously flowed the waters of Nahuel Huapi Lake, which now feed the river Limay); the Senguerr (spelled Senguer on most Argentine maps and within the corresponding region), the Deseado River. Besides these transverse depressions (some of them marking lines of ancient inter-oceanic communication), <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>others</b> which were occupied by more or less extensive lakes, such as the Yagagtoo, Musters and Colhue Huapi, and others situated {{to the south of}} Puerto Deseado, in the centre of the country.|$|E
