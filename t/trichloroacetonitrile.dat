40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{is focused on the}} development of a multifaceted approach to the catalytic activation of nitriles. To develop a versatile method for catalytic nitrile activation two probes were utilised; i) the development of a direct synthesis of allylic amides from the corresponding allylic alcohol and nitrile using a commercial platinum salt, together with a detailed mechanistic investigation into the process, ii) the direct synthesis of 2 -bezoxazole from the corresponding 2 -aminophenol and nitrile {{with the aid of a}} commercial platinum salt as well as the use of alcoholic solvents. In addition to nitrile activation a preliminary study on the application and further functionisation of 2 -trichlorobenzoxazoles was undertaken. i) 	A novel multifaceted approach to the direct synthesis of allylic amides via the catalytic activation of di- and <b>trichloroacetonitrile</b> will be discussed. This one-pot methodology relies on the same platinum catalyst to activate a nitrile towards nucleophilic attack of allylic alcohol as well as activate the newly formed allylic imidate towards a [3, 3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, which produced a number of allylic amides. In addition to the development of the one-pot allylic amide methodology a number of mechanistic studies including 1 H, 13 C 1 H and gas chromatography were under taken to better understand the process. ii) 	The second probe used to identify the versatility of this multifaceted catalyst approach to nitrile activation was the direct synthesis of 2 -benzoxazoles. Within this study it was discovered that protic solvents were able to activate di- and <b>trichloroacetonitrile</b> efficiently towards nucleophilic attack of the nitrogen nucleophile. From this discovery a mild and effective synthesis of a variety of di- and trichlorobenzoxazoles was developed in which the solvent was acting as the activating agent towards nucleophilic attack. iii) 	Preliminary results will also be reported on the novel manipulation of the trichloromethyl moiety of benzoxazoles. Within this study two efficient methodologies for the selective synthesis of 2 -(pyrrolidin- 1 -yl) benzo[d]oxazole and benzo[d]oxazol- 2 -yl(pyrrolidin- 1 -yl) methanone were developed from a single starting material.

This is then subjected to a tandem Overman rearrangement/RCM/Kharasch cyclisation, forming the desired bicyclic lactam in high yield and high enantiomeric excess. Overall, the one-pot tandem process involves three mechanistically distinct processes catalysed by palladium(II) (step 1) and Grubbs 1 st generation catalyst (steps 2 and 3). The use of a thermal Overman rearrangement in tandem with the Grubbs catalysed RCM/Kharasch cyclisation was also investigated.

40|$|With {{the use of}} a one-pot process, a {{diastereoselective}} {{synthesis of}} bicyclononanes and decanes has been developed. Initial treatment of an allylic alcohol with <b>trichloroacetonitrile,</b> in the presence of DBU, afforded the corresponding allylic trichloroacetimidate. The trichloroacetimidate was then subjected to a one-pot process involving a thermal Overman rearrangement, ring-closing-enyne-metathesis and a hydrogen-bond directed Diels-Alder reaction to form polycyclic products in good isolated yields and as single diastereomers. Research was then carried out on how this process could be extended. Through the use of Grubbs second generation catalyst, the process was extended to include a cross-metathesis reaction forming highly functionalised 1, 3 -dienes. These 1, 3 -dienes were then used in the hydrogen bond directing Diels-Alder reaction to generate highly functionalised polycycles, again as single diastereomers. This process was then employed towards the first total synthesis of the natural product, netamine A.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to develop a new synthetic method for the asymmetric synthesis of imidazolinones. This method involved an addition-cyclization reaction of an optically pure alpha-amino acid ester and a nitrile. While imidazolinones have been synthesized by other means, this synthetic route has the advantage of producing an enantiomerically pure heterocycle. Furthermore, the wide variety of amino acids and nitriles available could produce an extensive series of imidazolinone derivatives whose potential for therapeutic uses could be explored. The first step in this reaction involved the amino addition of an a-amino acid ester to a nitrile to give an intermediate amidine ester. This intermediate could then undergo intramolecular ring closure to form the imidazolinone via the amidinium ion or the amidine. This investigation found base catalysis, aluminum chloride catalysis, Bronsted-acid catalysis and mercury(ll) catalysis to be unsuccessful in effecting amino additions to aliphatic and aromatic nitriles under the given conditions.

40|$|Ozonation before {{chlorination}} {{is associated}} with enhanced formation of chloropicrin, a halonitromethane disinfection by-product (DBP), during drinking water treatment. In order to elucidate reasons for this, five natural organic matter (NOM) surrogates were treated using both chlorination and ozonationâ€“chlorination under controlled laboratory conditions. Selected surrogates comprised two phenolic compounds, two free amino acids and one dipeptide; these were resorcinol, 3 -aminophenol, L-aspartic acid, Î²-alanine and ala-ala, respectively. Quantified DBPs included chloropicrin, chloroform, dichloroacetonitrile and <b>trichloroacetonitrile.</b> Relative to chlorination alone, increases {{in the formation of}} chloropicrin from ozonationâ€“chlorination varied from 138 % for 3 -aminophenol to 3740 % for ala-ala for the four amine surrogates. This indicates that ozone is more effective than chlorine in mediating a rate-limiting oxidation step in chloropicrin formation, most plausibly involving conversion of an amine group to a nitro group. While both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surrogates acted as chloropicrin precursors, ala-ala was the most reactive precursor following ozonationâ€“chlorination. Since peptides are far commoner in drinking water sources than free amino acids, further research into chemical oxidation of these species by ozone and chlorine is recommended. In contrast, oxidation with ozone prior to chlorination reduced chloroform formation moderately for the two phenolic compounds...|$|E

Compared with the CPs, PMâ€“PAC significantly enhanced the removal of DOC, DON, NH 3 +â€“N, and algae from 52. 9 %, 31. 6 %, 71. 3 %, and 83. 6 % to 69. 5 %, 61. 3 %, 92. 5 %, and 97. 5 %, respectively. PM pre-oxidation alone and PAC pre-adsorption alone did not substantially reduce the formation of dichloroacetonitrile, <b>trichloroacetonitrile,</b> N-nitrosodimethylamine and dichloroacetamide. However, the PMâ€“PAC integrated process significantly reduced the formation of both C-DBPs and N-DBPs by 60 â€“ 90 % for six C-DBPs and 64 â€“ 93 % for six N-DBPs, because PM oxidation chemically altered the molecular structures of nitrogenous organic compounds and increased the adsorption capacity of the DBP precursors, thus highlighting a synergistic effect of PM and PAC.

Every year thousands of toxic chemicals are manufactured and released into the environment, and governments have stricter and stricter regulations. As a result, conventional methods sometimes cannot meet the requirements. Advanced oxidation, a group of innovative technologies utilizing hydroxyl free radical, is developed to meet the challenge. This research investigated two advanced oxidation technologies, namely aqueous sonochemistry and supercritical water oxidation. Both the mechanisms and plausibility to degrade aqueous pollutants in complex matrices were studied. The processes were further optimized via selecting of appropriate operative parameters, including sound frequency, intensity, and flow rate for sonochemistry, and temperature, pressure, and oxygen concentration for supercritical water oxidation. Aqueous sonochemistry demonstrated high degradation rates and effective dehalogenation for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), <b>trichloroacetonitrile,</b> chloropicrin and bromobenzene even in complex matrices involving multiple pollutants, various impurities and high COD loads. Analysis of products and intermediates confirmed that free-radical attack and pyrolysis were the major mechanisms. 358 kHz was the most efficient frequency for all compounds studied. Higher sound intensity and faster flow also benefited sonication. Organic solids decelerated sonication when the targeted compound adsorbed strongly on the solids, but dissolved solids and inorganic solids had minimal effect on sonicaiton. Supercritical water oxidation rapidly destroyed nitrobenzene. Greater than 90 % of organic N and 67 % of organic C was transformed into inorganic species with high selectivity towards N 2 and CO 2 when nitrobenzene was decomposed.
