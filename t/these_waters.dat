5|$|Predation by orcas on whale calves in high productivity, high {{latitude}} areas {{has been}} hypothesised {{to be the}} reason for great whale migrations to low productivity tropical waters, {{to reduce the risk}} of attacks on the highly vulnerable calves due to lower density of orcas in <b>these</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|E

Mitochondrial DNA sequences support the theory that these are recently diverged separate species. More recently, complete mitochondrial sequencing indicates the two Antarctic groups that eat seals and fish should be recognized as distinct species, as should the North Pacific transients, leaving the others as subspecies pending additional data. Advanced methods that sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome revealed systematic differences in DNA between different populations.|$|E

40|$|Antifreeze {{proteins}} (AFPs) help many organisms {{protect themselves}} from freezing in subzero temperatures. The most active AFPs found to date are those from insects, which possess exceptionally regular β-helical structures. On the ice-binding surface of these proteins, regularly arrayed water molecules are observed within the repeating Thr-Xxx-Thr motif, but the exact role of <b>these</b> <b>water</b> molecules remains unknown. In this work, we have employed a number of computational methods to examine the role of <b>these</b> <b>water</b> molecules in an AFP from Tenebrio molitor (TmAFP). Our investigation involved a combination of molecular and quantum mechanical approaches. Properties such as stability, interaction energy, orbital overlap, and conformational analysis of various systems, including TmAFP-water, TmAFP-water-ice, and TmAFP-ice, were systematically evaluated and compared. The regularly arrayed water molecules were found to remain associated with TmAFP before ice binding, demonstrating that they are an intrinsic part of the protein. <b>These</b> <b>water</b> molecules may assist TmAFP {{in the process of}} ice recognition and binding. However, after facilitating the initial stages of ice recognition and binding, <b>these</b> <b>water</b> molecules are excluded in the final formation of the AFP-ice complex. The departure of <b>these</b> <b>water</b> molecules enables a better two-dimensional match between TmAFP and ice. These results agree with experimental observations showing that although <b>these</b> <b>water</b> molecules are aligned with the ice-binding hydroxyl groups of Thr residues in one dimension, they are in fact positioned slightly off in the second dimension, making a good two-dimensional match impossible...|$|R
5|$|The {{southern}} {{side of the}} massif lies mostly within Italy and is {{bounded by}} the Val Veny and Val Ferret whose watercourses meet just above the town of Courmayeur. From Courmayeur <b>these</b> <b>waters</b> flow southwards as the Dora Baltea towards Aosta, eventually joining the Po river. However, the extreme southwestern end of the massif does lie within France and is bounded by the Vallée des Glaciers (which connects to the Val Veny over the watershed of the col de la Seigne), and its waters flow southwards towards the Isère river and onwards to the Rhône. The northeastern end of the massif falls within Switzerland, and is bounded by a separate valley, confusingly also called Val Ferret, and which separates it from the Pennine Alps further east. Its watercourse, la Dranse de Ferret, flows northwards to join the Rhône at Martigny.|$|E
5|$|Whales again {{migrate off}} Japanese archipelagos {{and into the}} Sea of Japan. Connections between these stocks and whales seen in the Sea of Okhotsk, on Kamchatka coasts and around the Commander Islands have been studied. Historical {{wintering}} distributions could have been much wider and more southerly distributed, as whales were seen in areas along the Batanes, Sulu and Celebes Seas including off Palawan, Luzon, Malaysia and Mindanao, with higher densities around today's Cape Eluanbi and Kenting National Park. Unconfirmed sightings have been reported near Borneo in modern times. The first confirmation in modern Taiwan was of a pair off Hualien in 1994, followed by a successful escape from entanglement off Taitung in 1999, and continuous sightings around Orchid Island in 2000. Few/none regularly migrate into Kenting National Park. In addition, despite sightings reported almost annually off Green and Orchid Islands, relatively short stays in <b>these</b> <b>waters</b> indicate recoveries as winter foraging has not occurred. Sightings, including of a cow-calf pair, have occurred along {{the east coast of}} Taiwan. Around Hong Kong, two documented sightings were recorded in 2009 and in 2016.

5|$|Willaumez {{made no move}} to {{challenge}} Stopford or Gambier, although he had successfully united with the Rochefort squadron of three ships of the line, two frigates and an armed storeship, the captured British fourth rate ship Calcutta, commanded by Commodore Gilbert-Amable Faure. Together the French fleet, now numbering 11 ships of the line, withdrew from the relatively open Basque Roads anchorage into the narrow channel under the batteries of the Île-d'Aix known as the Aix Roads. <b>These</b> <b>waters</b> offered greater protection from the British fleet, but were also extremely hazardous; on 26 February, as the French manoeuvred into the shallower waters of their new anchorage the 74-gun Jean-Bart grounded on the Palles Shoal off Île Madame, and was wrecked. The channel in which Willaumez chose to position his fleet formed a strong defensive position: an assailant had to cross the open Basque Roads and advance past the long and dangerous Boyart Shoal hidden just below the surface. On entering the channel, an attacking force would then come under fire from fortified gun batteries on Île-d'Aix before finally encountering the French fleet. The anchorage had been successfully attacked before, such as during the Raid on Rochefort in 1757, but more recent efforts in 1803, and 1807 had ended in failure.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} {{progress}} made {{in developing a}} water sampling system for detection and analysis of volatile organic compounds in water with a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS).
