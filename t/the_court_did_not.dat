50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> need {{to approve}} a reaffirmation {{agreement}} which applies to consumer debt secured by real estate. This applies to any mortgages on your home or other debts secured by your home. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> approve any reaffirmation agreements between debtors and credit unions. They are filed and {{become part of the}} record without a hearing.|$|R
50|$|Applying this {{analysis}} {{to the facts}} at hand, Marshall found that <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have jurisdiction over the case.|$|R
50|$|Where {{there has}} been a death at sea, and no body has been brought ashore, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have {{jurisdiction}} to hold an inquest.|$|R
5|$|Because Justice Anthony Kennedy did {{not join}} Stevens' opinion as to several parts, largely {{on the grounds of}} {{judicial}} parsimony (that is, having decided that the military commissions had no foundation, the core question of the case was decided and <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> need to go further), those sections were without a majority in support.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the ACLU became {{involved}} in a case involving the distribution of child pornography (New York v. Ferber). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the three prong obscenity test should be outlawed, but that the law in question was overly restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> adopt the ACLU's position.|$|E
5|$|In Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., the U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled that}} the {{corporation}} tax act of 1909 did not violate the constitutional requirement that revenue measures originate in the U.S. House of Representatives. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> rule that excise taxes consisted only of taxes on corporations and corporate privileges, {{to the exclusion of}} taxes on individuals (natural persons). The issue of the validity of an income tax imposed on individuals was neither presented to the Court nor decided by the Court.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>court</b> is {{satisfied}} with the plea, then the matter proceeds to the fourth stage listed above. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> at this stage enter a conviction.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> {{have its}} own {{judicial}} officers. Instead, stipendiary magistrates constitute <b>the</b> <b>court.</b> In certain circumstances, the judicial registrar or a registrar may constitute <b>the</b> <b>court</b> as well.|$|R

5|$|In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2011), the {{applicant}} sought a declaration that section 377A of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. The High Court stated {{that a person}} who is asserting an infringement of a constitutional liberty must establish that he or she has not merely a sufficient interest but a substantial interest in the matter, that is, he or she must be alleging a violation of a fundamental liberty. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> discuss the issue of standing in the context of administrative law.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court also issued {{important}} opinions regarding criminal procedure. Although <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> explicitly cite or quote constitutional provisions, its opinions remain {{influential in}} interpreting the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and venue provision of Article Three. The Court also laid down the common law rules of evidence in federal courts, including the hearsay exception for party admissions and the narrowing of the best evidence rule.|$|E
5|$|After decades, the Oneida became {{frustrated}} {{by the failure of}} the case to settle. Instead, they began to purchase land within the claim area in fee simple, asserting sovereignty over the re-acquired parcels and refusing to pay property tax. In City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), the Supreme Court held that laches barred the re-assertion of sovereignty over ancestral land re-acquired in fee simple; <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> consider whether the original aboriginal title over the disputed parcels was validly extinguished, and thus did not disturb its holding in Oneida II.|$|E

5|$|At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own {{authority}} over his pirate crew. He {{told the court}} that his crew engaged in piracy against his will, {{and said he had}} warned them that he would leave the crew unless they stopped robbing vessels. He further stated that he had been asleep during the capture of the sloop Francis. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> accept these protestations. Boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that Bonnet's quartermaster, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet. A powerful quartermaster {{appears to have been a}} common feature of pirate crews in the early modern era.|$|E
5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed the matter to be decided {{according}} to the subjective discretion of the Minister. The only explanation given for deregistration was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service was contrary to the public interest. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> require the executive to elaborate on exactly how a failure to perform national service would be contrary to public interest. It accepted the executive's discretion to derogate a fundamental right without a close scrutiny of the executive's rationale and explanations.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} under regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, the fact that goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require {{the owner of the}} goods to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether the customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision. However, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|E

50|$|Proceedings of tribunals {{in civil}} matters and {{hearings}} in criminal matters were public, {{in conformity with}} <b>the</b> law. <b>The</b> <b>courts</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> exercise judicial review, as the interpretation of laws was {{the responsibility of the}} legislature.|$|R
5|$|In the 2016 Austrian presidential election, Freedom Party {{candidate}} Norbert Hofer won {{the first}} round of the election, receiving 35.1% of the vote, making that election the Freedom Party's best ever election result in its history. However, in the second round, Hofer was defeated by Alexander Van der Bellen, who received the support of 50.3% compared to Hofer's 49.7%. On July first the Constitutional Court of Austria voided the results of the second round due to mishandling of postal votes; although <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> find evidence of deliberate manipulation. The re-vote took place on 4 December 2016 when Van der Bellen won by a significantly larger margin.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> explain this.|$|E
5|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{concurrence}} which {{stated that}} Congress {{was very careful}} to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that {{is all that is}} needed to decide the case, but that the Court went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under the constitution to authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians. Finally, Kennedy was concerned that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> address the question of the Equal Protection Clause. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.|$|E
5|$|Judicial {{independence}} is essential. It would be futile {{for people to}} approach <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> for adjudication of their disputes if <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> apply <b>the</b> law independently. Moreover, people can only be guided by the law if judges apply it correctly.|$|R
5000|$|This {{is because}} in 90% of contested trials <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> order shared {{parenting}} [...] Part {{of this is}} because of the belief of many judges that if parties have to litigate for shared custody then they are unsuited to it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{constitutional}} {{position in}} New Zealand ... {{is clear and}} unambiguous. Parliament is supreme and the function of <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> is to interpret the law as laid down by Parliament. <b>The</b> <b>courts</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have a power to consider the validity of properly enacted laws.|$|R
5|$|The court {{declared}} that Hill was not validly elected at the 1998 federal election. However, {{they did not}} declare the whole election invalid, acting on an earlier decision of the court, because although no effect could be given to voters' preferences for Hill, their other preferences were not invalid, and those {{could be used to}} determine who should be elected in Hill's stead. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> reach a definite decision about what action should be taken, remitting that question to a lower court. Eventually, Len Harris, the number two candidate on the One Nation ticket, was elected in Hill's stead, taking up his seat on 1 July 1999.|$|E
5|$|When Taft {{became chief}} justice, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{have its own}} {{building}} and met in the Capitol. Its offices were cluttered and overcrowded, but Fuller and White had been opposed to proposals to move the court to its own building. In 1925, Taft began a fight to get the court a building, {{and two years later}} Congress appropriated money to purchase the land, {{on the south side of}} the Capitol. Cass Gilbert had prepared plans for the building, and was hired by the government as architect. Taft had hoped to live to see the court move into the new building, but it did not do so until 1935, after Taft's death.|$|E
5|$|The Partisan Prohibitions were {{repealed}} {{during the}} Yellow Turban Rebellion and Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion in 184 AD, largely because <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{want to continue}} to alienate {{a significant portion of the}} gentry class who might otherwise join the rebellions. The Yellow Turbans and Five-Pecks-of-Rice adherents belonged to two different hierarchical Daoist religious societies led by faith healers Zhang Jue (d.184 AD) and Zhang Lu (d.216 AD), respectively. Zhang Lu's rebellion, in modern northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi, was not quelled until 215 AD. Zhang Jue's massive rebellion across eight provinces was annihilated by Han forces within a year, however the following decades saw much smaller recurrent uprisings. Although the Yellow Turbans were defeated, many generals appointed during the crisis never disbanded their assembled militia forces and used these troops to amass power outside of the collapsing imperial authority.|$|E
50|$|Until <b>court</b> {{approval}} of <b>the</b> {{rejection of the}} collective bargaining agreement, the debtor must comply {{with all of its}} provisions. If <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> issue a timely ruling, the debtor may terminate or alter the provisions of <b>the</b> agreement pending <b>court</b> action. (d)(2).|$|R
50|$|The Second Constraint is that <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have {{sufficient}} {{independence from the}} legislative and executive branches to affect significant social reform. This Constraint can be overcome by securing support from substantial numbers in Congress and securing {{the support of the}} executive branch.|$|R
50|$|In {{my opinion}} {{there is a}} {{substantial}} Sherman Act issue in this case, but since <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> reach it and since my views relative thereto would be superfluous in light of today's disposition of the case, I express no ultimate conclusion concerning it.|$|R
