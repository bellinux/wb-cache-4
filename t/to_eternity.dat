5|$|On 15 March, a new {{compilation}} {{to accompany}} 2009's Somewhere Back in Time was announced. Entitled From Fear <b>to</b> <b>Eternity,</b> the original release date {{was set at}} 23 May but was later pushed back to 6 June.

5|$|The ACLU lost an {{important}} press censorship case when, in 1957, the Supreme Court upheld the obscenity conviction of publisher Samuel Roth for distributing adult magazines. As late as 1953, {{books such as}} Tropic of Cancer and From Here <b>to</b> <b>Eternity</b> were still banned. But public standards rapidly became more liberal though the 1960s, and obscenity was notoriously difficult to define, so by 1971 prosecutions for obscenity had halted.|$|E
5|$|The {{basis of}} the musical is the 1951 novel From Here <b>to</b> <b>Eternity</b> by James Jones. In 1941, Jones was serving with the US Army in Hawaii, {{at the time of}} Pearl Harbor, and the novel was loosely based on his {{experiences}} in the 27th Infantry Regiment. It focuses on the lives of a group of soldiers {{in the months leading up}} to the attack, in particular Private Prewiit, a boxer who no longer wants to fight having blinded an opponent, and Sergeant Milt Warden, who has an affair with the wife of his commanding officer.|$|E

5|$|Reaching the cascade, {{or rather}} cataract, the roaring {{of which had}} a long time {{announced}} its vicinity, my soul was hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous dashing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which mocked the exploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to heaven, and I asked myself why I was chained to life and its misery? Still the tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, with renewed dignity, above its cares – grasping at immortality – it seemed as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, still the same, torrent before me – I stretched out my hand <b>to</b> <b>eternity,</b> bounding over the dark speck of life to come.|$|E
5|$|PFC Guy Gabaldon (1926–2006) went to {{live with}} the parents of his Japanese-American friend at the age of 12. At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, his adoptive family was placed in a relocation camp. Gabaldon joined the Marines when he was only 17 years old; he was a Private First Class (PFC) when his unit was engaged in the Battle of Saipan in 1944. Gabaldon, who acted as the Japanese interpreter for the Second Marines, working alone in front of the lines, entered enemy caves, pillboxes, buildings, and jungle brush, frequently in the face of hostile fire, and succeeded in not only obtaining vital military information, but in convincing well over 1,000 enemy soldiers and civilians to surrender. He was nominated for the Medal of Honor, but was awarded the Silver Star instead. His medal was later upgraded to the Navy Cross. He turned in more enemy soldiers than Sergeant Alvin York, who was awarded the Medal of Honor during World War I for having captured 132 enemy German soldiers. Gabaldon's actions on Saipan were later memorialized in the film Hell <b>to</b> <b>Eternity,</b> in which he was portrayed by actor Jeffrey Hunter.|$|E

5|$|Sinatra {{forged a}} highly {{successful}} career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for From Here <b>to</b> <b>Eternity,</b> he starred in The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in The Manchurian Candidate (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as On the Town (1949), Guys and Dolls (1955), High Society (1956), and Pal Joey (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward {{the end of his}} career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in Tony Rome (1967). Sinatra would later receive the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, The Frank Sinatra Show began on ABC in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, though before Kennedy's death Sinatra's alleged Mafia connections led to his being snubbed.|$|E
