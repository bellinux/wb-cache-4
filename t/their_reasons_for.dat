5|$|Belgium's 1920 Olympic squad {{was given}} a bye into the quarter-finals, where they won 3–1 against Spain, and reached the semi-finals, where they beat the Netherlands 3–0. In {{the first half of}} their final against Czechoslovakia, the Belgians led 2–0. Forward Robert Coppée {{converted}} a disputed early penalty, and the action in which attacker Henri Larnoe doubled the score was also a matter of debate. After the dismissal of the Czechoslovak left-back Karel Steiner, the discontented visitors left the pitch in the 40th minute. Afterwards, the away team reported <b>their</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> protest to the Olympic organisation; these complaints were dismissed and the Czechoslovaks were disqualified.

5|$|Despite these efforts, on 21February {{it became}} clear just how {{fundamentally}} opposed the groups were. Philip Nye, one of the dissenting brethren, asserted in a speech that a presbytery set over local congregations would become as powerful as the state and was dangerous to the commonwealth, provoking vigorous opposition from presbyterians. The next day, the Assembly finally began to establish a prescription for presbyterian government. Owing to a strong belief in {{the unity of the}} church, the Assembly continued to try to find ways to reconcile the dissenting brethren with the majority throughout 1644, including the establishment of a special committee for that purpose in March. However, on 15November, the dissenting brethren presented <b>their</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> disagreement {{with the rest of the}} Assembly to Parliament, and on 11December the majority submitted a draft of a presbyterian form of government.|$|E
5|$|Exactly {{who owned}} the Hoxne Hoard, and <b>their</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> burying it, are not known, and {{probably}} never will be. However, the hoard itself and its context provide some important clues. The hoard evidently was buried carefully, some distance from any buildings. The hoard very likely represents {{only a portion of}} the precious-metal wealth of the person, or people, who owned it; many common types of jewellery are missing, as are large tableware items such as those found in the Mildenhall Treasure. It is unlikely that anyone would have possessed the rich gold and silver items found in the Hoxne Hoard without owning items in those other categories. Whoever owned the hoard also would have had wealth in the form of land, livestock, buildings, furniture, and clothing. At most, the Hoxne Hoard represents a moderate portion of the wealth of someone rich; conversely, it may represent a minuscule fraction of the wealth of a family that was incredibly wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Numerous notable riders {{were present}} in the race peloton, though <b>their</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> {{attending}} varied slightly. Top stage racers like Cadel Evans, Ivan Basso, Robert Gesink, Vincenzo Nibali, Joaquim Rodríguez, Andy Schleck, and Marco Pinotti were present. Evans' attendance was mainly for racing kilometers before attempting to win the Tour de France. Basso, who likewise planned to peak at the Tour de France, came to the race hoping for overall victory. He named Gesink as a potential rival, and Gesink for his part claimed Basso as a rider he fears. Schleck, Nibali, and Evans were named by one pre-race analysis as possible contenders, but not favorites, due to their plans to be at peak form later in the season.|$|E

5|$|The Governor didn't {{have the}} right to make or suspend any laws, unless in cases of urgent necessity, he could do it with the consent of the Governor-General of India.

The Governor-General had full power to superintend and control the Governor in all points relating to the civil or military administration of the Presidency, and the Governor had to obey the orders and instructions of the Governor-General in all cases. The Governors could propose to the Governor-General drafts of any laws which they thought expedient, together with <b>their</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the same; and the Governor-General communicated the resolutions to the Governor, after considering the reasons. The Governors regularly transmitted to the Governor-General true copies of all orders and acts of their governments, and also advice of all matters which they felt to be communicated to the Governor-General. The powers of the Governors were not suspended when the Governor-General visited the Presidency.

Alternately, the Governor could resign by declaring it in writing and delivering it to the secretary for the public department of the Presidency.|$|E
