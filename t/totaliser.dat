50|$|Bharat Electronics Limited, Bengaluru, and Electronics Corporation of India Limited, Hyderabad, {{developed}} the <b>totaliser.</b> <b>Totaliser</b> is an interface, which {{is connected to}} main control units of a cluster of 14 EVMs (hence, in 14 polling stations), and the consolidated result of votes cast for each candidate in that group of EVMs {{can be obtained by}} pressing the result button in the <b>totaliser,</b> but without disclosing the votes polled by a candidate polling-station-wise.|$|E
50|$|<b>Totaliser</b> is a {{proposed}} mechanism {{in the voting}} machines in India to hide the booth-wise voting patterns. A <b>totaliser</b> allows the votes cast in about 14 polling booths to be counted together. At present, the votes are tallied booth by booth.|$|E
50|$|During appeals, the sum {{of money}} or objects {{collected}} is presented on the <b>totaliser</b> - a display that lights to show the amount collected. With some appeals, a second <b>totaliser</b> has often been introduced immediately after the original target has been met, {{with the aim of}} providing an incentive to keep on donating.|$|E

50|$|This year saw {{the biggest}} <b>totaliser</b> {{record in the}} history of Children in Need, a {{staggering}} £46.6 million. An overall total will be unveiled in summer 2017, when much more donations keep coming through.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Totaliser</b> clocks mounted {{first on}} the back of the terrace and then after a larger roof was added in 1961 to cover most of the terrace, on the roof fascia, gave it its name.|$|E
50|$|The 2007 Disc Drive Appeal was, controversially, {{handled in}} a {{different}} editorial style, {{and it was not}} featured in each programme since its launch as in previous years. Also the <b>totaliser,</b> previously a part of the studio set, was relegated to an on-screen animation/graphic.|$|E
5000|$|The ban on {{gambling}} {{was lifted}} in 1930. That year, more than 350 high-quality racehorses from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico raced at Helena, and parimutuel betting (assisted by an automatic <b>totaliser)</b> first occurred. The [...] "paddock" [...] was abandoned the same year, and a true, open-air paddock was built next to it.|$|E
50|$|Like Blue Peter, Magpie {{featured}} {{appeals for}} various causes and charities. Notably, however, it asked for cash donations rather than stamps or secondhand goods, familiar on Blue Peter. The cash <b>totaliser</b> {{was a long}} strip of paper which {{ran out of the}} studio and along the adjacent corridor walls. Unlike the BBC programme, Magpie was unscripted and the presenters were free to improvise the presentation of the show.|$|E
50|$|TOTO can be {{purchased}} {{from any of the}} 300 Singapore Pools outlets across Singporus. Draws are conducted every Monday and Thursday at 1830h or 6:30pm (SG/HK time). The “live” TOTO draw can be viewed at the Singporus Pools Main Branch at 210 Middle Road. The profits from TOTO go to the Singapore <b>Totaliser</b> Board (the owner of Singapore Pools) which uses the money for charity and other worthy causes.|$|E
50|$|The 2008 {{appeal was}} called Mission Nutrition, {{an attempt to}} provide {{children}} in the UK, Bangladesh and South Africa with better food. As part of this appeal, the Blue Peter presenters held the world's biggest bring and buy sale on 18 February 2009, which was attended by several celebrities as well as regular people. Since the 2008 appeal {{there has been a}} return to regular features on the Appeal's progress in each edition, and the reinstatement of a physical studio set <b>Totaliser.</b>|$|E

He won the Excellence for Singapore Award presented by the Singapore <b>Totaliser</b> Board in 2000. He was also awarded the Singapore Internationale by the Singapore International Foundation in 2001. His most recent award is the 2001 Arts Supporter Award presented by the National Arts Council.|$|E
5000|$|A {{candidate}} {{can know}} how many people from a polling station voted for him. This is a significant issue particularly if lop-sided votes for/against a candidate are cast in individual polling stations and the winning candidate might show favoritism or hold grudge on specific areas. The Election Commission of India has stated that the manufacturers of the EVMs have developed a <b>Totaliser</b> unit which can connect several balloting units and would display only the overall results from an Assembly or a Lok Sabha constituency instead of votes from individual polling stations.|$|E
50|$|During Indian general election, 2014, former Maharashtra {{deputy chief}} {{minister}} Ajit Pawar had allegedly threatened the voters that his party, Nationalist Congress Party, {{would be able}} to detect the voting patterns from the electronic voting machine readings and cut off their water supply if they snubbed it in Baramati (Lok Sabha constituency). Law Commission said <b>Totaliser</b> would also help in situations such as witnessed in Hoshangabad (Lok Sabha constituency) in 2014, where lone voter casted vote in Mokalvada polling station in Sohagpur area. Before the introduction of the electronic voting machines in India, ballot papers were mixed wherever necessary to prevent disclosure of the voting patterns.|$|E
5000|$|The Foundation's patron is King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. It {{is governed}} by a board with members {{representing}} the cultural, scholarly and business communities in the Netherlands.

[...] the organisation has three staff members, and the director is Shanti van Dam. Funding for the Foundation originally came from the Dutch lottery and the Sport <b>Totaliser,</b> although it is now financially independent.|$|E
5000|$|Myrobella {{began her}} racing career at Salisbury Racecourse {{in the spring}} of 1929, {{finishing}} second on her debut and then winning a maiden race. She won her next four races, competing against colts on each occasion. In July she contested the most valuable two-year-old race of the year, the £6953 National Breeders' Produce Stakes over five furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse. Ridden by the champion jockey Gordon Richards, she displayed [...] "wonderful speed" [...] in the early stages and built an unassailable lead to win very easily: according to the Sporting Life, Richards only had to sit still and wait till the winning post was passed. In September she moved up in distance for the Champagne Stakes over six furlongs at Doncaster. She started the 11/8 favourite and won by six lengths from the colt Coroado. Myrobella ended her season at Newmarket Racecourse in autumn, winning the Boscawen Stakes and the Prendergast Stakes. In the latter event, run on 14 October Myrobella's victory led to a failure of the <b>totaliser</b> betting system: as almost all the tickets on the race had been bought for Myrobella, the Tote sustained a £232 loss on the race.|$|E
40|$|A two-channel boxcar {{integrator}} with {{an analog}} to digital converter was constructed using integrated circuits wherever convenient. The digital output can be instantaneously displayed or displayed after accumulating many samplings in the <b>totaliser.</b> The <b>totaliser</b> mode provides averaging at the digitiser level {{and hence the}} integrator has an infinite holding time. When used in the double boxcar mode the instrument overcomes the problem of any base line instability...|$|E
40|$|Racetrack {{gambling}} {{is an example}} of a complex feedback system between the expectation of winning and the probability of losing. This paper examines one aspect of the economic process of gambling, by looking at how humans choose to wager money on the outcome of three different race types: thoroughbred, harness, and greyhounds. A relationship called the Golden section (1 : 1. 618) can then be used to model the division between the amount bet to Win or Place. This information is provided by the <b>Totaliser</b> and is available online, and therefore represents the set of discrete decision events that contribute towards the market. The results show that for races involving a human element (a human rider) for thoroughbred and harness races, the public select to divide wagers into win and place ratios reflecting emergent global decision-making towards Golden section scaling. For greyhound races (with no human rider), the betting public do not follow Golden section statistics in deciding bet size proportionality. This finding is important, since race wagering markets can be modelled as complex systems of interacting agents. This study also reveals the nonlinear signature of human decision making under risk-reward. Further, deciding to bet in the average 0. 618 of ones’ money to win demonstrates attractor behavior that results in emergent self-organization...|$|E
