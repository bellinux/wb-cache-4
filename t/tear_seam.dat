40|$|Abstract: The {{passenger}} airbag(PAB) {{designed for}} standard sized adults may induce unexpected results {{to children in}} out-of-position(OOP) postures. In this work, using MADYMO software, simulations of the OOP injury of children have been performed with respect to PAB design parameters and child dummy positions. The {{attention is focused on}} some details with respect to the injury of 3 and 6 year old children in two OOP postures. Among the various design parameters of the passenger airbag systems, four parameters are selected for the sensitivity analysis of the injury with the Taguchi method: bag folding pattern, vent hole size, position of the cover <b>tear</b> <b>seam</b> and the type of door <b>tear</b> <b>seam.</b> An optimal combination of the parameters is suggested...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the Advanced Restraint System has lead to an innovative {{way in which we}} evaluate the systems effect on the occupant. This paper presents some initial investigation into the driver airbag system that consists of an inflator, cushion fold, <b>tear</b> <b>seam</b> pattern, and offset of the airbag cover to steering wheel rim plane. An initial DOE is reviewed to establish significant parameters and to identify equations for further investigation...|$|E
5000|$|Older surfaces, such as double jute-backed {{carpets and}} loose rugs with natural {{foundation}} yarns, could shrink after a wet treatment, leading to suppositions that wet-cleaning could also remove wrinkles. [...] However, this notion is antiquated and this method could also occasionally <b>tear</b> <b>seams</b> or uproot strips. [...] Newer carpets, such as with synthetic backing and foundation yarns, do not shrink, and they smooth easily; in such carpets, wrinkles indicate an underlying problem, such as delamination where the secondary backing becomes unstuck {{from the primary}} backing, that may need a certified carpet inspector to determine.|$|R

50|$|Before using a sex toy, owners {{should take}} precautions. One should check for <b>tears,</b> rough <b>seams</b> or cracks that could harm {{the inside of}} the vagina or anus. Condoms should also be used on porous sex toys and sex toys that are being shared between two or more partners. They should also use {{appropriate}} lubricants; silicone lube will break down silicone toys, and oil-based lubes will break down latex condoms.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to the protection performance and comfort, other essential factors {{need to be considered}} while selecting a FFPPC include durability, ease of care, cost, difficulty in production and user preference. The durability can affect the protection and is evaluated by measuring the tensile, <b>tearing</b> and <b>seam</b> strength; abrasion and puncture resistance of the fabric. The selection of FFPPC should also consider the method the garments will be laundered and the potential impact of laundering on the performance. Various standards such as ASTM F 2757 – 09, ASTM F 1449 – 08 and NFPA 2113 specify the conditions and methods for the use, care and maintenance of flame resistant clothing.|$|R
5|$|ILC did {{not produce}} apparel for adults until the {{introduction}} of the Living Girdle in 1940, after patenting a method of manufacturing latex girdles that would not <b>tear</b> at the <b>seams</b> if they had a small tear or hole. The Living Girdle was advertised with images of mobility and comfort, such as women playing tennis or leaping while wearing it, though the solid rubber girdle was actually very uncomfortable.|$|R
5000|$|Traditional teardown. Although pretty rare, in {{this case}} the {{external}} measurements are made (usually consisting of seam length, seam thickness and countersink). Internal parameters are evaluated by <b>tearing</b> down the <b>seam,</b> then measuring the cover hook and body hook parameters mechanically. Then, various calculations are made to evaluate overlap. This procedure is generally considered bad form as it does not evaluate all the seam parameters on the same exact point, which can lead to missing serious defects (including false seams).|$|R
5000|$|A {{radio-controlled}} Fritz X glide-bomb {{had been}} released {{at a safe distance}} by a high-flying German warplane and it exploded 49 ft (15 m) distance from [...] Savannah increased her speed to 20 kn (23 mph, 37 km/h) as a KG 100 Dornier Do 217 K-2 bomber approached from out of the sun. The USAAF's P-38 Lightnings and Savannahs anti-aircraft gunners, tracking this warplane at 18,700 ft (5,700 m), failed to stop the Fritz X bomb, trailing a stream of smoke. The bomb pierced the armored turret roof of Savannahs No. 3 gun turret, passed through three decks into the lower ammunition-handling room, where it exploded, blowing a hole in her keel and <b>tearing</b> a <b>seam</b> in the cruiser's port side. For at least 30 minutes, secondary explosions in the turret and its ammunition supply rooms hampered firefighting efforts.|$|R
40|$|A cricket ball {{possesses}} six rows of stitches {{with approximately}} 70 to 90 stretches in each row and a prominent seam at the joining of two halves. Asymmetric airflow over the ball due to seam orientation and surface roughness {{of the ball}} can cause the flight deviation (swing) and unpredictable flight. Swing makes difficult for the batsman {{to hit the ball}} with the bat and guard the stamps. The primary objectives of this work were to understand the aerodynamic properties of a series of used cricket balls, thus the mechanism of swing as well as drag of a cricket ball. The aerodynamic forces and moments of used and new balls were measured under a range of speeds at various seam orientations. The airflow around the balls was visualized and documented. The preliminary data analysis indicated that the wear & <b>tear</b> and <b>seam</b> angle have significant effect on aerodynamic drag and side forces of the cricket ball...|$|R
5000|$|Few of Titanics animals {{survived the}} ship's sinking. Three {{of the dogs}} were taken aboard {{lifeboats}} by their owners. Margaret Hays' Pomeranian got away safely in Lifeboat 7 and lived until 1919, while Elizabeth Rothschild refused to board Lifeboat 6 unless her dog was allowed to come too. Henry and Myra Harper brought their Pekingese aboard Lifeboat 3, but Helen Bishop had to abandon Frou-Frou in her cabin, much to their mutual distress. The dog attempted to stop her leaving by holding on to her dress with his teeth until the <b>seam</b> <b>tore.</b> Afterwards, Bishop spoke of her sorrow: [...] "The loss of my little dog hurt me very much. I will never forget how he dragged on my clothes. He so wanted to accompany me".|$|R
50|$|The first suits used {{traditional}} sewing {{methods to}} simply overlap two strips of rubber and sew them together. In a rubber wetsuit {{this does not}} work well {{for a number of}} reasons, the main one being that punching holes straight through both layers of foam for the thread opens up passages for water to flow {{in and out of the}} suit. The second problem is that the stretching of the foam tended to enlarge the needle holes when the suit was worn. This meant that a wetsuit could be very cold all along the seams of the suit. And although the sewn edge did hold the two pieces together, it could also act as a perforated tear edge, making the suit easier to <b>tear</b> along the <b>seams</b> when putting it on and taking it off.|$|R
50|$|Experts {{consider}} version #4 {{the most}} likely — temperature changes in the pool's water stressed welding <b>seams,</b> <b>tearing</b> them. When building #5's repository was designed, {{it was assumed that}} the water would be kept at a constant temperature by heat from the nuclear assemblies suspended under the surface. A separate water heating system was thus deemed unnecessary. But the designers were wrong, harsh Arctic climate covered the pool's surface with a 20 cm layer of ice in winter. In order to solve this problem, the ice was melted using steam from the boiler, in blatant violation of radiation safety protocol. This was accomplished in the following manner: a hole was drilled in the ice cover, a pipe was inserted into the hole, and steam was pumped through the pipe under the ice, melting it. Radioactive aerosols spread through the whole building, leaking into the air outside.|$|R
60|$|When Tommy, with Elspeth and Grizel, set off excitedly for the town, {{the country}} folk were already {{swarming}} in. The Monypenny road {{was thick with}} them, braw loons in blue bonnets with red bobs to them, tartan waistcoats, scarves of every color, woollen shirts as gay, and the strutting wearers in two minds--whether {{to take off the}} scarf to display the shirt, or hide the shirt and trust to the scarf. Came lassies, too, in wincey bodices they were like to burst through, and they were listening apprehensively as they ploughed onward for a <b>tearing</b> at the <b>seams.</b> There were red-headed lasses, yellow-chy-headed and black-headed, blue-shawled and red-shawled lasses; boots on every one of them, stockings almost as common, the skirt kilted up for the present, but down it should go when they were in the thick of things, and then it must take care of itself. All were solemn and sheepish as yet, but wait a bit.|$|R
5000|$|The band {{announced}} their disbandment on March 8, 2015. [...] "Thank you to everyone that has supported Means End since its inception. Our current constellation {{has come to}} an end. As band-members we shared a common interest in taking progressive metal into uncharted compositional directions. This bond produced The Didact and many good memories, but the nature of [...] "being progressive" [...] <b>tore</b> at our <b>seams.</b> Driven by an aspiration to progress, change, and innovate, the scope of our musical endeavor outgrew us. As a band, {{we were not able to}} balance a project of such ambition with work, studies, family, children and other responsibilities.We have an uncommonly diverse fan-base to which we owe a lot. Many of you have taken a personal stake in actively supporting Means End and spreading the word. Rest assured that we will, as individuals, continue to build on this foundation and continue to compose new great music." ...|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, Kirwin was {{appointed}} Lieutenant, junior grade, on 16 June 1942, and saw action aboard Savannah in the Battle of the Atlantic and in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa. He {{was promoted to}} Lieutenant on 1 December 1942, and saw further combat aboard Savannah in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. [...] Savannah then supported Operation Avalanche, the Allied invasion of mainland Italy at Salerno. On 11 September 1943, while bombarding German shore defenses in Salerno Bay, Savannah was among cruisers which came under heavy German aerial attack. The cruisers and British Supermarine Spitfire fighters drove off nearly 60 German bombers before a Dornier Do 217K-2 bomber hit Savannah with a Fritz X radio-controlled, armor-piercing guided bomb. It pierced the armored roof of the No. 3 gun turret immediately {{in front of the}} ships bridge, passed through three decks into the lower shell-handling room, and exploded there, blowing a gaping hole in the ships bottom, and <b>tearing</b> open a <b>seam</b> in the ships port side. For 30 minutes, secondary explosions in the gun room hampered fire-fighting efforts.|$|R
40|$|Kirmser Undergraduate Research Award - Group category, grand prizeCitation: Garman, K., Boudreaux, C., Ezell, J., & Mahoney P. (2015). Design of a cadaver {{rotation}} system. Unpublished manuscript, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS. Edwin BrokeshThe Kansas State University (KSU) Cadaver Dissection Team (CDT) {{is challenged}} to provide comprehensive human anatomy demonstrations to regular lab students. However, {{to see all}} structures adequately, the cadaver must be flipped over. Attempting to rotate a 300 -pound cadaver without proper aid may result in labor injury, cadaver tissue damage, compromised lab spaces, and lost preservatives. The Rotational Anatomy Senior Design team is creating a system to help the CDT lift and rotate their cadavers. This design project was broken into two categories: harness and lift. The harness interfaces with the cadavers, while the lift is the supporting structure connecting to the harness and instigating rotational movement. After designing multiple frameworks for the lift, the team ran numerous Finite Element Analysis (FEA) models representing a concentrated static force slightly larger than that produced by the maximum cadaver weight via SolidWorks Simulation. This showed that the lift designed was able to withstand {{the weight of a}} 330 -pound cadaver with minimal to no flexion. Rotational Anatomy also created a harness that distributes the cadaver's weight by wrapping around the legs and continuing up the shoulders, keeping the cadaver both stable and horizontal during lift and rotation. Upon installing the electric winch system, the lift and harness designs will be thoroughly tested with CDT's current cadavers and volunteer design team members. The criteria for successful testing are: 1) less than 1 / 16 " flexion for framework means it is safe and stable and 2) no <b>tears</b> or ripped <b>seams</b> on harness means it is durable and appropriate. Time permitting, the framework will undergo polishing touches: rubber trimming to mitigate wall damage, and a powder coating to deter rust after years of use. Upon timely and successful test results, both the lift and the harness will be implemented in the Cadaver Dissection Lab by May 2015...|$|R
