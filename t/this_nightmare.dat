[...] Chang argues that Japan [...] "remains to this day a renegade nation," [...] having [...] "managed to avoid the moral judgment of the civilized world that the Germans were made to accept for their actions in <b>this</b> <b>nightmare</b> time." [...] However, according to Kennedy, this accusation has already become a cliché of Western criticism of Japan, most notably exemplified by Ian Buruma's The Wages of Guilt (1994), whose general thesis might be summarized as [...] "Germany remembers too much, Japan too little." [...] Kennedy pointed out that a vocal Japanese left has long kept the memory of Nanking alive, noting the 1995 resolution of Japan's House of Councillors that expressed [...] "deep remorse" [...] (fukai hansei) for the suffering that Japan inflicted on other peoples during World War II and clear apologies (owabi) for Imperial Japan's offenses against other nations from two Japanese Prime Ministers.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "My Heart Is Broken" [...] {{was directed by}} Dean Karr. Filming commenced on December 1, 2011 in Los Angeles. During an interview with MTV News, Lee stated that the visual was [...] "ethereal", also saying that [...] "this [...] {{is going to look}} a lot different. Actually, I kind of wanted it to be the opposite. The first video, for 'What You Want,' was very real, and this is very surreal." [...] The singer further confessed that the clip draws inspiration from dark fantasy horror film Paperhouse (1988) in order to achieve surreality. Lee further explained, [...] " [...] this girl, and everything that she would draw would come to life in her dreams, and she was creating this dream world for herself. And at first, it was cool, but then it's like <b>this</b> <b>nightmare.</b> So I sort of thought it would apply, and be cool, to have it be this dream that you're trapped in. So you're in a place that, at first, is a magical world, but at the same time, you're isolated and trapped there, and that's the reason you {{want to come back to}} reality after a time." [...] When filming the video, fiber optics were used reportedly in order to create the effect of things coming to life after drawing them. Lee described the appearance of the rest of the group in the visual as [...] "sort of like the dream within the dream, in an abyss of darkness".|$|E
2500|$|In the novella, the {{character}} David Drayton—who is married—has a sexual encounter with Amanda Dumfries, {{who is also}} married. Darabont {{did not want to}} attempt conveying on screen the protagonist being involved in an extramarital affair. The characters in the film, portrayed by Thomas Jane and Laurie Holden respectively, instead share a more emotional relationship. Jane explained, [...] "We kind of form a little family, sort of surrogate family where my son and I'm a father and she becomes the mother to the son. We become a little unit as we're trying to get through <b>this</b> <b>nightmare</b> together." [...] Holden compared the nightmare to what refugees experienced at the Louisiana Superdome during Hurricane Katrina.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1967 {{interview}} with Burgin, Borges recalled how his interactions with Argentina's Nazi sympathisers {{led him to}} create the story. He recalled, [...] "And then I realized that those people {{that were on the}} side of Germany, that they never thought of German victories or the German glory. What they really liked was the idea of the Blitzkrieg, of London being on fire, of the country being destroyed. As to the German fighters, they took no stock in them. Then I thought, well now Germany has lost, now America has saved us from <b>this</b> <b>nightmare,</b> but since nobody can doubt on which side I stood, I'll see what can be done from a literary point of view in favor of the Nazis. And then I created the ideal Nazi." ...|$|E
2500|$|Temple Grandin {{is opposed}} to {{shackling}} and hoisting {{as a method of}} handling animals and [...] wrote, on visiting a shechita slaughterhouse, [...] "I will never forget having nightmares after visiting the now defunct Spencer Foods plant in Spencer, Iowa fifteen years ago. Employees wearing football helmets attached a nose tong to the nose of a writhing beast suspended by a chain wrapped around one back leg. Each terrified animal was forced with an electric prod to run into a small stall which had a slick floor on a forty-five degree angle. This caused the animal to slip and fall so that workers could attach the chain to its rear leg [...] As I watched <b>this</b> <b>nightmare,</b> I thought, 'This should not be happening in a civilized society.' In my diary I wrote, 'If hell exists, I am in it.' I vowed that I would replace the plant from hell with a kinder and gentler system." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, Robert Dale Segee of Circleville, Ohio {{claimed he}} was {{responsible}} for setting the circus fire. Segee, a [...] roustabout for the show from June 30 to July 14, 1944, when he was about 14 years old, said he had a nightmare in which an Indian riding on a [...] "flaming horse" [...] told him to set fires. He further claimed that after <b>this</b> <b>nightmare</b> his mind went blank, and that he did not come out of this state until the circus fire had already been set. It was said Segee fit the description of a serial arsonist right out of a psychiatrist's textbook. Segee also knew intimate details of the incident, which some believed only the real arsonist could have known. For instance, it was never made public that the circus had two smaller fires of undetermined origin prior to the tragedy. Segee admitted setting both of them as well. These statements, Segee added, were in response to a later dream he'd had of a woman standing in flames urging him to confess.|$|E
