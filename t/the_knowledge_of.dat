This method is not essential for anyone too sick or in mortal danger – such a person may renounce verbally or mentally.|$|E

30|$|According to {{the matrix}} that is {{depicted}} in Table 1, if <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domain concept C 3 is increased, then <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domain concepts C 1, C 2 and C 4 will be increased also, {{but not in the}} same degree. According to the transformation function of the FCM the following will be happened: KL 1 (t[*]+[*] 1)[*]=[*]KL 1 (t)[*]+[*] 0.39 *p 3 *KL 1 (t)/ 100,[*]KL 2 (t[*]+[*] 1)[*]=[*]KL 2 (t)[*]+[*] 0.5 *p 3 *KL 2 (t)/ 100, and KL 4 (t[*]+[*] 1)[*]=[*]KL 4 (t)[*]+[*] 0.27 * p 3 *KL 4 (t)/ 100. In particular, if <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> C 3 is increased 100 %, then <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> C 1, C 2 and C 4 will be 39 %, 50 % and 27 % correspondingly. While, if it is increased 50 %, then <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> C 1, C 2 and C 4 will be 19.5 %, 25 %, and 13.5 % correspondingly. Likewise, if <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domain concept C 4 is decreased, then <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domain concept C 3 will be decreased also. According to the transformation function <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> C 3 will be decreased as KL 3 (t[*]+[*] 1)[*]=[*]KL 3 (t)- 0.67 *p 4 *KL 3 (t). Specifically, if <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> C 4 is decreased 30 %, then <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> C 3 will be decreased 20.1 %. It is remarkable to refer that the decrease on <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> C 3 will cause decrease on <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> its related domain concepts C 1 and C 2 (C 4 will not be decreased again because this is the domain concept that causes all the changes on <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remains domain concepts).|$|R

30|$|The arcs in the FCM which {{represent}} the domain concepts’ dependencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domain <b>knowledge</b> are bidirectional. Furthermore, {{the value of}} the arc Ci[*]→[*]Cj is not essentially equal to {{the value of the}} arc Cj[*]→[*]Ci. This is happened {{due to the fact that}} changes on <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> Ci may affect <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> Cj in a different degree than changes on <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> Cj affect <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> Ci. For example, in the field of algorithms, if a learner knows how to calculate an average in an iterative structure with concrete number of loops, it implies that s/he knows also how to calculate a sum in an iterative structure with no concrete number of loops, since calculating an average incorporates calculating the corresponding sum. Similarly, if a student excels at calculating a sum in an iterative structure with no concrete number of loops, it implies that s/he knows partly how to calculate an average in an iterative structure with concrete number of loops, since calculating the sum is the base for calculating an average. However, these two domain concepts do not affect each other in the same degree. <b>The</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> calculating an average in an iterative structure with concrete number of loops affects 100 % (the value of the corresponding arc is 1) <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> calculating a sum in an iterative structure with no concrete number <b>of</b> loops, while <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> calculating a sum in an iterative structure with no concrete number of loops affects 80 % (the value of the corresponding arc is 0.8) <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> calculating an average in an iterative structure with concrete number of loops. These “strengths of impact” have been defined by experts in the field of algorithms and programming languages.|$|R

This prediction was supported in 1914 by Henry Moseley who, having discovered that atomic number was an experimentally measurable property of elements, found that a few atomic numbers had no known corresponding elements: the gaps were 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.
