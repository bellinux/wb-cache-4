5|$|<b>Tracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> is {{generally}} considered the best method for airway management under {{a wide variety of}} circumstances, as it provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration. However, <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> requires a great deal of clinical experience to master and serious complications may result even when properly performed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> can be {{associated}} with minor complications such as broken teeth or lacerations of the tissues of the upper airway. It can also {{be associated}} with potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents which can result in a severe and sometimes fatal chemical aspiration pneumonitis, or unrecognized intubation of the esophagus which can lead to potentially fatal anoxia. Because of this, the potential for difficulty or complications due to the presence of unusual airway anatomy or other uncontrolled variables is carefully evaluated before undertaking <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubation.</b> Alternative strategies for securing the airway must always be readily available.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> is {{indicated}} {{in a variety}} of situations when illness or a medical procedure prevents a person from maintaining a clear airway, breathing, and oxygenating the blood. In these circumstances, oxygen supplementation using a simple face mask is inadequate.|$|E
30|$|This is a {{retrospective}} study of <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubations</b> conducted at a tertiary academic hospital. This analysis included all intubations {{performed by the}} medical emergency team in the general ward during a 48 -month period.|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubations</b> involve {{the use of a}} viewing instrument of one type or another. Since its introduction by Kirstein in 1895, the conventional laryngoscope has been the most popular device used for this purpose. Today, the conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries with a light source, and a set of interchangeable blades.|$|R
40|$|Background. The cuff {{pressures}} may {{be different}} in oesophageal and <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubations.</b> We conducted a study to evaluate if cuff pressures of endotracheal tubes (ETTs) could provide information to distinguish <b>tracheal</b> or oesophageal <b>intubations</b> in a pig trachea–oesophagus model. Methods. In each preparation of pig trachea–oesophagus model, the trachea and the oeso-phagus were intubated separately with a cuffed ETT, and the cuff pressures were measured after each 1 ml increment of air (1 – 10 ml) during inflation. The cuff pressures and the pressure–volume relationships in both intubations were compared. Results. The cuff pressures of oesophageal intubations {{were significantly higher than}} those of <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubations</b> in all comparisons from 1 to 10 ml of cuff volumes (P, 0. 05). The cuff pressure–volume curve was steeper in the oesophageal intubation group, and {{the difference between the two}} curves was the largest when the cuff volume was 4 – 5 ml. Conclusions. We conclude that the cuff pressures may be useful in detecting oesophageal intubations. This method is faster than other confirmation measures as it can detect inadver-tent oesophageal intubations at the time of inflating the cuffs...|$|R
5|$|Airway {{management}} can {{be classified}} into closed or open techniques depending on the system of ventilation used. <b>Tracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> is a typical example of a closed technique as ventilation occurs using a closed circuit. Several open techniques exist, such as spontaneous ventilation, apnoeic ventilation or jet ventilation. Each has its own specific advantages and disadvantages which determine when it should be used.|$|E
5|$|Certain medical {{procedures}} can also injure the airways; these include <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubation,</b> bronchoscopy, and tracheotomy. The {{back of the}} trachea may be damaged during tracheotomy. TBI resulting from <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> (insertion of a tube into the trachea) is rare, and the mechanism by which it occurs is unclear. However, one likely mechanism involves an endotracheal tube catching in a fold of membrane and tearing it as it is advanced downward through the airway. When an endotracheal tube tears the trachea, it typically does so at the posterior (back) membranous wall. Unlike TBI that results from blunt trauma, most iatrogenic injuries to the airway involve longitudinal tears {{to the back of}} the trachea or tears on the side that pull the membranous part of the trachea away from the cartilage. Excessive pressure from the cuff of an endotracheal tube can reduce blood supply to the tissues of the trachea, leading to ischemia and potentially causing it to become ulcerated, infected, and, later, narrowed.|$|E
5|$|There are {{significant}} differences in airway anatomy and respiratory physiology between children and adults, and these are taken into careful consideration before performing <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> of any pediatric patient. The differences, which are quite significant in infants, gradually disappear as the human body approaches a mature age and body mass index.|$|E

The other field is prophylaxis and therapy of ventriculous arrhytmia on myocardial infarction and in cardiosurgery. It is used also for prophylaxis of sympathic reaction during <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubations.</b>|$|R
40|$|Situated {{cognition}} {{argues that}} learning {{takes place in}} an embedded social and physical environment, and through a social process, reality takes on meaning. This dissertation investigated if a link exists between learners? participation and advancement within a sociocultural community of practice as specifically evidenced by higher rates of <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubations</b> on live patients and scores on the national certifying examination by paramedics. During 2006, paramedic students taking the national certifying examination were asked to answer a post-examination questionnaire quantifying the number of intubations performed during training. For intubation experience, significant odds ratios (relative to none performed) were observed for 4 to 9 performed [OR = 1. 66, 95 % c. i. = (1. 24, 2. 23) ] and 16 or more performed [OR = 1. 76, 95 % c. i. = (1. 21, 2. 56) ]. The male to female odds ratio [OR = 1. 25, 95 % c. i. = (1. 04, 1. 52) ] was significant. For age category, significant odds ratios (relative to 40 and over) were observed for 20 to 24 [OR = 1. 70, 95 % c. i. = (1. 27, 2. 28) ] and 25 to 29 [OR = 1. 32, 95 % c. i. = (1. 00, 1. 73) ]. For education, the bachelor?s degree to high school odds ratio [OR = 2. 56. 95 % c. i. = (1. 95, 3. 35) ] was significant. For ethnicity, significant odds ratios (relative to African-Americans) were observed for whites [OR = 1. 69, 95 % c. i. = (1. 04, 2. 74) ] and others [OR = 2. 33, 95 % c. i. = (1. 15, 4. 72) ]. The multivariable logistic regression model {{results suggest that the}} number of <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubations,</b> sex, ethnicity and education level are all associated with greater odds of passing the certifying examination. In addition to traditional classroom lectures and activities, paramedic students also learn in clinical situations with varying levels of supervision culminating in near independent practice. Theories of situated cognition provide insight into these clinical learning situations that break from traditional models. When context, content, and community merge, knowledge is generated in new and meaningful ways. By participating in communities of practice, knowledge is transferred, created, and altered along with the learner through active engagement with all the illstructured, dynamic, and unpredicted opportunities the ?real world? offers. The students? exposure to live <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubations</b> during training serve as an example of situated learning environments and its influence can be observed through the national certifying examination. The findings provide guidance for paramedic educators in creating situative learning affordances and specifically, determining the number of <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubations</b> performed during paramedic training...|$|R
30|$|Results A {{total of}} 276 <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubations</b> were timed and {{analyzed}} for the simulation trial. We demonstrated that ES- 1 {{as compared to}} TT- 1 was a powerful mean to significantly reduce TI delay of: novices when C 3 was imposed in OT, LG and RA; and skilled physicians when C 3 was imposed for LG and RA. For the clinical trial, 250 patients were included. Details of both groups were similar. We demonstrated in the subgroup of patients with POGO score of < 30  % (n =  73) that ES- 1 as compared to TT- 1 significantly reduced TI delay.|$|R
5|$|Although {{it offers}} the {{greatest}} degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration, <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> {{is not the only}} means to maintain a patent airway.

5|$|<b>Tracheal</b> <b>intubation,</b> usually simply {{referred}} to as intubation, is the placement of a flexible plastic tube into the trachea (windpipe) to maintain an open airway or {{to serve as a}} conduit through which to administer certain drugs.

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubations</b> involve {{the use of a}} viewing instrument of one type or another. The modern conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries that power a light and a set of interchangeable blades, which are either straight or curved.

Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique of blind intubation of the trachea is rarely practiced today, although it may still be useful in certain emergency situations, such as natural or man-made disasters. In the prehospital emergency setting, digital intubation may be necessitated if the patient is in a position that makes direct laryngoscopy impossible. For example, digital intubation may be used by a paramedic if the patient is entrapped in an inverted position in a vehicle after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged extrication time.|$|R
40|$|Background: Experience of {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR) in real clinical setting {{is not easily}} possible for all medical students. Purpose: To assess medical student perceived self-sufficiency on three procedural skill on internship courses after they had taken a training course in clerkship period. Methods: Forty three medical students who had attended a workshop on CPR, <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubations</b> and venopuncture answered the questionnaires on their perceived self-sufficiency in performing these procedures after serving a few months as interns. Results: The mean score for perceived self-sufficiency (PSS) was 75. 84 (± 18. 63).

5|$|Between 1945 and 1952, optical {{engineers}} {{built upon}} the earlier work of Rudolph Schindler (1888–1968), developing the first gastrocamera. In 1964, optical fiber technology {{was applied to}} one of these early gastrocameras to produce the first flexible fiberoptic endoscope. Initially used in upper GI endoscopy, this device was first used for laryngoscopy and <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> by Peter Murphy, an English anesthetist, in 1967. The concept of using a stylet for replacing or exchanging orotracheal tubes was introduced by Finucane and Kupshik in 1978, using a central venous catheter.|$|E
5|$|For {{infants and}} young children, orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier than}} the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube. As with adults, {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> in children. Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients.|$|E
5|$|General {{anesthesia}} {{is often}} administered without <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> in selected {{cases where the}} procedure is brief in duration, or procedures where the depth of anesthesia {{is not sufficient to}} cause significant compromise in ventilatory function. Even for longer duration or more invasive procedures, a general anesthetic may be administered without intubating the trachea, provided that patients are carefully selected, and the risk-benefit ratio is favorable (i.e., the risks associated with an unprotected airway are believed to be less than the risks of intubating the trachea).|$|E

After 10 s of tuition, 40 anaesthetists attempted to pass a standard gum elastic bougie between the cords, with and without the nasendoscope, in randomised order. A bougie curved to an 'optimal curve' was also tested. Using the standard bougie 13 / 40 (33 %) passed the bougie between the cords without the nasendoscope, compared with 31 / 40 (78 %) when using the nasendoscope (p < 0. 001). The 'optimal curve' bougie resulted in 29 / 40 (73 %) and 39 / 40 (98 %) success rates without and with the nasendoscope, respectively (p = 0. 004).

5|$|Many {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in an effort to}} predict difficulty of <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubation,</b> including the Cormack-Lehane classification system, the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), and the Mallampati score. The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation that the size of the base of the tongue influences the difficulty of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of palatine uvula, faucial pillars and the soft palate. Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system. Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubation.</b> In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{indication}} for <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> is for the placement of a conduit through which nitrous oxide or volatile anesthetics may be administered.

40|$|Background and Aims: The Airtraq™ video {{laryngoscope}} facilitates <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubations</b> {{in patients}} with difficult airway or cervical spine immobilization. However, curved reinforced tracheal tube and straight reinforced tracheal tubes are useful where neck of the patient {{is likely to be}} moved or flexed or if patient is in prone position, wherein nonreinforced endotracheal tube (ETT) might get kinked and/or compressed. We compared intubation success rate of curved and straight reinforced tracheal tubes with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tracheal tube using Airtaq™ laryngoscope in paralyzed and anesthetized patients.

We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials up to 1 January 2017. Outcome parameters extracted from studies were: first-attempt success of tracheal intubation; time to successful intubation; number of intubation attempts; Cormack and Lehane grade; use of airway adjuncts (e. g. stylet, gum elastic bougie); and complications (e. g. mucosal and dental trauma). Nine studies, including 1329 patients, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. First-attempt success was greater for all videolaryngoscopes (OR 0. 34 (95 %CI 0. 18 - 0. 66); p = 0. 001).

5|$|<b>Tracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> is not {{a simple}} {{procedure}} and the consequences of failure are grave. Therefore, the patient is carefully evaluated for potential difficulty or complications beforehand. This involves taking the medical history of the patient and performing a physical examination, the results of which can be scored against one of several classification systems. The proposed surgical procedure (e.g., surgery involving the head and neck, or bariatric surgery) may lead one to anticipate difficulties with intubation. Many individuals have unusual airway anatomy, such as those who have limited movement of their neck or jaw, or those who have tumors, deep swelling due to injury or to allergy, developmental abnormalities of the jaw, or excess fatty tissue of the face and neck. Using conventional laryngoscopic techniques, intubation of the trachea can be difficult or even impossible in such patients. This is why all persons performing <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubation</b> must be familiar with alternative techniques of securing the airway. Use of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope and similar devices has become among the preferred techniques in the management of such cases. However, these devices require a different skill set than that employed for conventional laryngoscopy and are expensive to purchase, maintain and repair.|$|E
5|$|When {{taking the}} patient's medical history, {{the subject is}} {{questioned}} about any significant signs or symptoms, such as difficulty in speaking or difficulty in breathing.

Previous experiences with <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubation,</b> especially difficult intubation, intubation for prolonged duration (e.g., intensive care unit) or prior tracheotomy are also noted.|$|E
5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea.

This study aimed to determine which preventive measures may have been effective in protecting HCWs from infection, and which were not effective. Methods A retrospective study was performed among 758 'frontline' health care workers who cared for SARS patients at the Second Affiliated Hospital and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The HCWs with IgG against SARS and those without IgG against SARS were respectively defined as the "case group" and the "control group", and logistic regression was conducted to explore the risk factors for SARS infection in HCWs. Results After adjusting for age, gender, marital status, educational level, professional title, and the department in which an individual worked, the results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that incidence of SARS among HCWs was significantly and positively associated with: performing <b>tracheal</b> <b>intubations</b> for SARS patients, methods used for air ventilation in wards, avoiding face-to-face interaction with SARS patients, the number of pairs of gloves worn by HCWs, and caring for serious SARS cases.
