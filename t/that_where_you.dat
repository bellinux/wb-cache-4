500|$|In 2005, JJ Koczan of The Aquarian Weekly wrote <b>that</b> <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> Want to Be might [...] "perhaps {{go down in}} {{pop culture}} history as the record that broke the emo scene commercially." [...] Six tracks from the album were {{included}} on the 2007 Notes from the Past compilation. In 2014, Alternative Press Brian Kraus wrote that it was [...] "the closest they've come to the elusive 'perfect album. Calling it [...] "catchy" [...] in comparison to Tell All Your Friends, the album [...] "matured the words past freshman year and flexed the rhythm guitar to a new level." [...] In 2016, Fuse.tv ranked Where You Want to Be its number-one Taking Back Sunday album. According to Jason Lipshutz, the album [...] "still smacks harder" [...] than the band's other releases due to [...] "a masterful sequencing, tighter hooks and most transcendent single ("A Decade Under The Influence")." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 9, 2007, Jay-Z {{appeared}} on the Charlie Rose Show to discuss the album. When asked about how the film gave life to this album, he stated [...] "It's a New York City true story, you know. So {{as soon as the}} movie came on, it was like familiar, things that my pop seen and my uncles seen and, you know, different things like that, things I've seen growing up. So they resonated with me in a way, the story, as well as, I mean, even though everything happens, you know, the way it turns out, you know, it's one of those movies <b>that</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> champion the bad guy, because the bad guy, you know, he don't seem like a bad guy, and the good guy — I mean the good guys are bad. You know, that complex — the complexity of human beings in this thing was amazing to me. I loved the complexity of the human beings".|$|E

"We {{ought to}} make sure that the terrorists... and there's no {{question}} but that in a setting like <b>that</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> have the ticking bomb, that the President of the United States - not the CIA interrogator - the President of the United States has to make the call. And Enhanced Interrogation Techniques have to be used - not torture, but enhanced interrogation techniques. Yes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There's no {{difficulty}} about that, sonny," [...] answered Flanagan. [...] "You just go right in. The difficulty {{is to get}} rid of them. <b>That's</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> want tact." ...|$|R
2500|$|Meath's captain Nigel Crawford {{gave his}} {{opinion on the}} incident: [...] "I'm sure most players have been {{involved}} in controversial situations like <b>that</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> get calls for replays and things like that happening, but I just don't think it's possible or I just don't think it can happen. If you start that, where do you end up? Do we go back and say the ball wasn’t on the ground when we touched it and they got a free or whatever? It's just very unfortunate that it happens in a high-profile game right {{at the end of a}} game to a team that hasn't won in a long time. It's just a very unfortunate situation".|$|E

6000|$|... 'Ho! <b>that's</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are!' {{he cried}} in his nasal tenor, which annoyed Vera's trained ear. She {{wished she had}} not been wearing a white dress to betray herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go on," [...] said Mr. Chase, with a chuckle. [...] "Go on. Don't mind me. You {{ought to}} be on the stage, Gussie, <b>that's</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> {{ought to be}}." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{were going}} into a freeway, and <b>that's</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> take the speeds up to 60 and 70 miles an hour. So {{we would not have}} had any agents there anyway".|$|R
6000|$|... “Are {{there any}} lions?” asked Eric hopefully. He {{had been reading}} Roman history and thought <b>that</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> found Christians you might {{reasonably}} expect to find a few lions.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{a part of}} the United States of North America {{that used}} to be known to the ancients as New England," [...] he replied. [...] "Is <b>that</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> mean, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have known}} him since I was able to talk. And is <b>that</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> go every day--is it he who takes you on these long walks and climbs that have brought back your health and strength? God bless the old doctor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He'll do so perfectly, if {{you give}} him a chance. <b>That's</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> can help me. Quarrel with him--he's rather good at a quarrel, and that will divert him and draw him off.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes. The {{latitude}} 8 d 20'. <b>That's</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> buried your late captain, isn't it?" [...] Then with severity: [...] "Don't you think, Mr. Burns, it's {{about time}} you dropped all that nonsense?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, <b>that's</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> make a mistake," [...] {{said the}} other; [...] "our sea-sovereignty hasn't slipped from us, and won't do, neither. There's the British Empire beyond the seas; Canada, Australia, New Zealand, East Africa." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>That</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> find an Island {{rising out}} of deep water, with a ring of coral round it, a little way from the shore--or, as in Eastern Australia, a coast with a {{fringing}} reef (the Flinders reef of Australia is eleven thousand miles long)--that is a pretty sure sign that that shore, or mountain, is sinking slowly beneath the sea. [...] <b>That</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> find, as you often do in the Pacific, a mere atoll, or circular reef of coral, with a shallow pond of smooth water in the centre, and deep sea round, that is a pretty sure sign that the mountain-top has sunk completely into the sea, and that the corals are going on building where its peak once was.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, don't take tea," [...] he protested. [...] "We've {{practically}} cut out {{afternoon tea}} here. It's {{part of our}} Turkish thrift movement. We're taking champagne instead.

5000|$|Later, during Advanced Flight Training at Kelly Field, Texas, Davis {{was intent}} on {{piloting}} multi-engine aircraft - specifically B-17s. His flight instructor, however, told him, [...] "No Davis you're a fighter pilot and <b>that's</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> want to be".|$|R
6000|$|Miss Flo laughed. Brice {{walked on}} silently; {{the girl was}} heartless and worthy of her education. After a pause she said demurely, [...] "I knew he wouldn't hurt you--but <b>YOU</b> didn't. <b>That's</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> showed your grit in walking {{straight}} on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--nary a letter! Ye see, that's jest it--and <b>that's</b> <b>where</b> <b>YOU</b> come in. You've got to {{convince}} that jury yourself. You've {{got to show}} what it is--tell the whole story your own way. Lord! to a man like you that's nothin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May we come too?" [...] Hewet asked. [...] "We can't go to bed.

60|$|I {{told you}} {{also in the}} epistle, that if the fifth commandment was the first that was with promise; then it follows, that the fourth, or that seventh day sabbath, had no promise entailed to it. Whence it follows, <b>that</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> read in the prophet of a promise annexed to a sabbath, {{it is best to}} {{understand}} it of our gospel sabbath (Isa 56).|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I pray you bide {{where you}} are, Merapi," [...] said the Prince, {{laughing}} a little, [...] "since {{it is certain}} <b>that</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> go I must follow, who {{have no desire to}} wander in the wilderness with your Hebrew folk.

60|$|The suavity of this {{pronouncement}} enfolded all {{as with a}} blessing. And at once, as if by magic, in the old, oak-panelled room, {{the world}} fell naturally into its three departments: <b>that</b> <b>where</b> they do <b>you</b> well; <b>that</b> <b>where</b> they do <b>you</b> better; and <b>that</b> <b>where</b> they give <b>you</b> Turkish baths for nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's so. I didn't {{think of}} that. Oh, I {{know what the}} matter is! What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got {{to find out where}} the shadow of the limb falls at midnight, and <b>that's</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> dig!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Where do {{you come}} from?' asked the mice, 'and what do you know?' They were {{extremely}} inquisitive. 'Do {{tell us about the}} most beautiful place in the world.

6000|$|... 'You {{served at}} Widdin?'--'Yes.'--'You led the attack?' [...] 'I did.'--'What next?'--'I really hardly know.'

6000|$|... "Wow, any {{ordinary}} {{woman would}} work in with me. But not Her Nibs. She would call it cheap and degrading {{and a lot of}} other things. It's got to be a genuine steal, and, if I'm caught at it, I lose my job. So <b>that's</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> come in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You say {{you want}} to know why you were cabled for. I'll tell you. There's no use talking for half a day before you get to the point. I guess you've heard that there's a prince here instead of a {{republic}} now? Well, <b>that's</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> come in." ...|$|R
