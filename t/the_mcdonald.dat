5|$|No other discoveries {{were made}} for almost another century. In 1948, Gerard Kuiper at <b>the</b> <b>McDonald</b> Observatory {{discovered}} the smallest and {{the last of the}} five large, spherical moons, Miranda. Decades later, the flyby of the Voyager 2 space probe in January 1986 led to the discovery of ten further inner moons. Another satellite, Perdita, was discovered in 1999 after studying old Voyager photographs.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{transfer}} from the Coney Island Terminal to the Norton's Point Trolley to Sea Gate, via an elevated footbridge across Stillwell Avenue to the elevated trolley station. In 1948, the trolley was discontinued because it duplicated another trolley along a similar route (namely <b>the</b> <b>McDonald</b> Avenue Line). The trolley ramp spanning Stillwell Avenue and West 15th Street was torn down around this time.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Rubin began {{a year-long}} {{collaboration}} with Geoffrey and Margaret Burbidge, during {{which made her}} first observations of the rotation of galaxies at <b>the</b> <b>McDonald</b> Observatory's 82 inch telescope. During her work at the Carnegie Institute, Rubin applied to observe at the Palomar Observatory in 1965, {{despite the fact that}} the building did not have facilities for women. She created her own women's restroom, sidestepping the lack of facilities available for her and becoming the first female astronomer to observe there.|$|E
50|$|In {{his senior}} year at Salmen High School in Slidell, Louisiana, Duhon was voted Mr. Basketball {{for the state of}} Louisiana, made <b>the</b> <b>McDonald's</b> All-American Team, and won <b>the</b> <b>McDonald's</b> Three Point Shootout.|$|R
50|$|Morris founded <b>the</b> first <b>McDonald's</b> in New Zealand in 1976. He {{established}} {{the company with}} the aid of several business partners, including Lionel Whitehead, Gary Lloydd, Ray Stonelake, and his brother, Wally Morris. <b>The</b> first <b>McDonald's</b> restaurant opened in Porirua on 7 June 1976. Morris headed <b>the</b> <b>McDonald’s</b> New Zealand company for more than twenty years. He emphasised employee training and franchising. Morris retired from <b>the</b> <b>McDonald's</b> company in <b>the</b> middle of the 1990s.|$|R

5|$|The family {{hoped that}} the ranch would be {{returned}} after the war, but it was not, and in 1970, the Army {{announced that it would}} be kept permanently. <b>The</b> <b>McDonald</b> Ranch House was empty and deteriorating until 1982, when it was stabilized by the Army. In 1984 it was restored by the National Park Service to appear as it did on July 12, 1945. The site is now open to visitors twice a year, on the first Saturday in April and October.|$|E
5|$|He then {{returned}} to academia, taking up residence at the University of Chicago Law School from 1977 to 1982, though he spent one year as a visiting professor at Stanford Law School. During Scalia's time at Chicago, Peter H. Russell hired him {{on behalf of the}} Canadian government to write a report on how the United States was able to limit the activities of its secret services for <b>the</b> <b>McDonald</b> Commission, which was investigating abuses by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The report – finished in 1979 – encouraged the commission to recommend that a balance be struck between civil liberties and the essentially unchecked activities of the RCMP. In 1981, he became the first faculty adviser for the University of Chicago's chapter of the newly founded Federalist Society.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, McDonald {{conducted}} a phylogenetic analysis of iguanodonts incorporating data from new Eolambia specimens. Contrary to previous authors, he found instead that Eolambia was the sister group of Probactrosaurus. This close relationship {{was based on}} two shared characteristics: the quadrate being straight save for the top end, which is curved backwards; and {{the top and bottom}} margins of the scapular blade being nearly parallel. Wenjie Zheng and colleagues added Jintasaurus to the group in 2014, while José Gasca and colleagues recovered the original group in 2015. However, McDonald extensively revised his phylogenetic dataset further in preparation for the 2017 description of the FMNH specimens. As with Horner and colleagues, as well as Prieto-Márquez and Norell, McDonald and colleagues found that Eolambia was the sister group of Protohadros, with both of them being placed as basal hadrosauromorphs (results reproduced below). Using the 2012 version of <b>the</b> <b>McDonald</b> dataset, Francisco Verdú and colleagues independently recovered a similar result, with Eolambia being closely related to Protohadros and Jeyawati; however, McDonald and colleagues found the latter to be more derived in 2017.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>McDonald's</b> {{fast-food}} restaurant chain derived its mascot clown Ronald <b>McDonald</b> from <b>the</b> Bozo {{character in the}} 1960s. Willard Scott, who had played Bozo during 19591962, first performed as the mascot in 1963 television spots. <b>The</b> <b>McDonald's</b> trademark application for the character dates to 1967.|$|R

25|$|On December 1, 2015, {{the city}} {{announced}} {{that there was}} a video of a fatal police shooting that took place on October 12, 2014. Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez's office investigated possible criminal charges against Officer George Hernandez (whose name was revealed on December 7), who shot Ronald Johnson III in the back during a foot chase. The officer opened fire seconds after arriving on the scene, when Johnson was moving away from police. Johnson was allegedly a known gang member and also allegedly armed; a gun was recovered at the scene. The attorney for Johnson's family contends police planted the weapon. The city fought to keep the video of the incident secret so as not to jeopardize the officer's right to a fair trial should he be indicted. As in <b>the</b> <b>McDonald</b> case, the video lacks audio. The city released the video on December 7 due to pressure for transparency prompted by <b>the</b> <b>McDonald</b> case. No charges have been filed against Hernandez.|$|E
