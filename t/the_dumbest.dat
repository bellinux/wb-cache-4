500|$|For the show's {{character}}s, Hillenburg {{started to}} draw and used character designs from his comic book—including starfish, crab, and sponge. He described Patrick as [...] "probably <b>the</b> <b>dumbest</b> guy in town". The character was {{conceived as a}} starfish to embody the animal's nature; according to Hillenburg, starfish look [...] "dumb and slow", but they are [...] "very active and aggressive" [...] in reality, like Patrick. Hillenburg incorporated character comedy rather than topical humor on the show to emphasize [...] "things that are more about humorous situations and about characters and their flaws." [...] He designed Patrick and SpongeBob as such because [...] "they're whipping themselves up into situations—that's always where the humor comes from. The rule is: Follow the innocence and avoid topical [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Upon release, {{the song}} {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Pytlik of Pitchfork applauded [...] "Yummy" [...] by {{calling it the}} [...] "Best Song" [...] on the parent album. Slants Cinquemani complimented Williams' minimalistic production on the track, and believed that it [...] "would have made a far less divisive choice for a first single", referring to [...] "Wind It Up" [...] being the lead single from The Sweet Escape. Christina Fuoco-Karasinski from the former website LiveDaily enjoyed the song, calling it [...] "delicious". Scott M. Baldwin from Sputnikmusic was mixed in his review of the parent album, declaring it [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>dumbest</b> sex songs ever written". He disliked the singer's lyrics as well, calling them [...] "the worst lyrics Stefani has written", but praised Williams' production, calling it [...] "just fantastic" [...] and [...] "a brilliant contrast". Amanda Murray from the same website also was mixed, calling it [...] "random-bullshit-friendly".|$|E
5000|$|From the 1630s the dumbshow {{no longer}} {{featured}} in mainstream British drama, but it resurfaced in harlequinades, pantomimes and melodramas in the 19th century. Thomas Holcroft introduced a dumb character in his play A Tale of Mystery (1802), and the device {{of using a}} mute to convey essential facts by dumbshow became a regular feature of melodramas. In his Dictionary of Literary Terms (first published in 1977), J. A. Cuddon lists 19th century plays with <b>the</b> titles <b>The</b> <b>Dumb</b> Boy (1821), <b>The</b> <b>Dumb</b> Brigand (1832), <b>The</b> <b>Dumb</b> Recruit (1840), <b>The</b> <b>Dumb</b> Driver (1849) and <b>The</b> <b>Dumb</b> Sailor (1854).|$|R

500|$|The {{edition of}} October 1, 1990 of People {{included}} {{an interview with}} then-First Lady of the United States Barbara Bush. The article included the following passage: [...] "She loves America's Funniest Home Videos but remains baffled after sampling The Simpsons. [...] "It was <b>the</b> <b>dumbest</b> thing I had ever seen," [...] she says, [...] "but it's a family thing, and I guess it's clean." [...] The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter on September 28 to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. On October 9, Bush sent a reply: [...] "Dear Marge, How kind of you to write. I'm glad you spoke your mind ... I foolishly didn't know you had one. I am looking {{at a picture of}} you... depicted on a plastic cup... with your blue hair filled with pink birds peeking out all over. Evidently, you and your charming family— Lisa, Homer, Bart and Maggie— are camping out. It's a nice family scene. Clearly you are setting a good example {{for the rest of the}} country. Please forgive a loose tongue." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot in two days in Gallatin and Hendersonville, Tennessee. On {{the first day of}} filming, Swift used a body double in order for both Swift, as the protagonist and antagonist, to appear in one shot. In a scene where she {{appeared}} dancing, White replaced Swift's routine with a one having no rhythm; she recalled, [...] "It was some of the most fun I'd had in a long time, just freaking out and doing <b>the</b> <b>dumbest</b> moves." [...] On the second day, they first filmed a prom scene and, lastly, the football game, both being filmed at Pope John Paul II High School. The school supplied many students as extras, including football players, band members, cheerleaders and students. The final prom scene used the school's decorations for its real prom the next night. When filming for a touchdown, Till was unable to catch the ball, furthering the length of the shoot. [...] "You put a lot of good solid effort in it and it looks good", Swift stated about filming.|$|E
500|$|The {{review by}} [...] "Herc" [...] for the website Ain't It Cool News, praised {{the story about}} how Porthos was named and the {{elements}} of sexual tension between Archer and T'Pol. However, he didn't think the Odd Couple type relationship between Archer and Phlox worked {{all the time with}} some misfires amongst the comedic elements. He gave the episode a rating of three out of five, describing it as [...] "actually worth your valuable time". Michelle Erica Green watched the episode for TrekNation, saying that she enjoyed the episode on the whole and enjoyed the characterisation. However, she criticised the non-moving Beagle prop as it made her son think the dog was dead, which was then followed by [...] "what looks like a drowned dog in formaldehyde". Jamahl Epsicokhan reviewed the episode for his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", giving it a score of one out of four. He called it [...] "easily <b>the</b> <b>dumbest</b> concept for an episode of Star Trek since Voyager holodeck was hijacked by the residents of [...] ". He felt that the episode made a mockery out of the characters and that some of the situations they were placed in were just ridiculous.|$|E

500|$|As the Republican presidential {{nomination}} race {{went into the}} primaries season, Romney had not endorsed anyone but {{was one of the}} Republican establishment figures who were becoming increasingly concerned about the front-runner status of New York businessman Donald Trump. Romney publicly criticized Trump for not releasing his taxes, saying there might be a [...] "bombshell" [...] in them. Trump responded by calling Romney [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>dumbest</b> and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics." [...] Then Romney gave a speech on March 3, 2016, at the Hinckley Institute of Politics, that represented a scathing attack on Trump's personal behavior, business performance, and domestic and foreign policy stances. He said Trump was [...] "a phony, a fraud ... He's playing members of the American public for suckers" [...] and that [...] "If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished." [...] In response Trump dismissed Romney as a [...] "choke artist". [...] Romney's speech represented an unprecedented attack by a major U.S. party's most recent presidential nominee against the party's current front-runner for the nomination. Romney encouraged Republicans to engage in tactical voting, by supporting whichever of the remaining rivals had the best chance to beat Trump in any given state, and as such Romney announced he was voting for, although not endorsing, Ted Cruz for president prior to the March 22 Utah caucus. [...] As the race went on, there was some evidence of tactical voting occurring, and some partial arrangements were formed among candidates, but by May 3 Trump had defeated all his opponents and became the party's presumptive nominee. [...] Romney then announced that he would not support Trump in the general election, saying, [...] "I am dismayed at where we are now, I wish we had better choices".|$|E

Handing the one-day captaincy to Matthew Walker, he continued as first-class captain {{until the end of the}} season, where a run-chase agreement led to him being criticised by other county captains. In an attempt to keep his side's Championship hopes alive, he agreed to chase a target of 420 in 70 overs with Nottinghamshire captain Stephen Fleming; Kent managed only to reach 210. The win for Nottinghamshire secured them the Championship. Shane Warne, the Hampshire captain whose side were also in the running for the title, described the agreement as [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>dumbest</b> things I have ever seen."

2500|$|In 1956, eighteen-year-old Charles Starkweather was {{introduced}} to 13-year-old Caril Ann Fugate by Caril's older sister, whom he had previously dated, but who had chosen to end their relationship. After Caril's sister introduced the two, they continued to talk, even after the relationship of Charles and her sister had ended. Starkweather {{had dropped out of}} Lincoln High School in his senior year and became employed at a Western Union newspaper warehouse. He sought employment there because the warehouse was located near Whittier Junior High School in Lincoln, where Fugate was a student. His employment allowed him to visit her every day after school. Starkweather was considered a poor worker and his employer later recalled, [...] "Sometimes you'd have to tell him something two or three times. Of all the employees in the warehouse, he was <b>the</b> <b>dumbest</b> man we had." ...|$|E

Reportedly, Beineman herself insisted Mrs. Goshe observe the man with whom she had accepted a ride, stating that she had made two foolish errors in her life: purchasing a wig; and accepting a ride from a stranger, before stating: [...] "I've got to be either the bravest or <b>the</b> <b>dumbest</b> girl alive, because I've just accepted a ride from this guy."

2500|$|At {{the spring}} race, Busch {{got into an}} {{incident}} with former Penske teammate Brad Keselowski. On pit road, Keselowski slowed in front of Busch, trying to avoid Kasey Kahne. Busch did not slow down in time and rear-ended Keselowski, causing severe damage to the racecar. Keselowski was upset by the collision and criticized Busch {{in an interview in}} the garages. On lap 87, Keselowski and Busch encountered each other on the track with Keselowski over forty laps down and Kurt running in fourth place. Keselowski tried to retaliate by bumping Busch repetitively until NASCAR officials and Keselowski's boss Roger Penske told Keselowski to go to the garage and take a long time-out for his antics. Despite this altercation, Busch {{went on to win the}} race while Keselowski finished 39th. Post-race, Keselowski was quoted as stating, [...] "Kurt does good things for charity and is such a talent but he is <b>the</b> <b>dumbest</b> racer."

There is a dollop of truth in them all. Yallop could be dull; if Dean Jones set the pulses of Melbourne grandmothers racing {{like a couple of}} shandies over lunch, then Yallop was the comforting mug of Milo who put them back to sleep. He was decidedly more at home when the spinners were on. He was also, {{especially}} at his 1983 peak, the epitome of rocklike solidity. And yes, he was a fatally flawed, forlorn captain... He was unimaginative, tactically unsophisticated and lacked the respect of his players.

2500|$|Jemison {{graduated}} from Chicago's Morgan Park High School in 1973 and entered Stanford University {{at the age}} of 16.

[...] "It’s not until recently that I realized that 16 was particularly young or that there were even any issues associated with my parents having enough confidence in me to [...] go that far away from home." [...] Jemison {{graduated from}} Stanford in 1977, receiving a B.S. in chemical engineering and fulfilling the requirements for a B.A. in African and Afro-American Studies. At Stanford, she choreographed a musical and dance production called Out of the Shadows. She took initiative to get even further involved in the black community by serving as head of the Black Students Union in college. Jemison said that majoring in engineering as a black woman was difficult because race was always an issue in the United States. [...] "Some professors would just pretend I wasn't there. I would ask a question and a professor would act as if it was just so dumb, <b>the</b> <b>dumbest</b> question he had ever heard. Then, when a white guy would ask the same question, the professor would say, 'That's a very astute observation.'" [...] In an interview with the Des Moines Register in 2008 Jemison said that it was difficult to go to Stanford at 16, but thinks her youthful arrogance may have helped her. [...] "I did have to say, 'I'm going to do this and I don't give a crap (damn).'"

2500|$|Goblins are reptilian fairies, often {{described}} as upright, raptor like creatures (minus the claws and feathers). They are quite stupid as they have brains the size of rats, but they can still talk and (to a certain extent) work machinery like lasers and sometimes even computers. They {{have the ability to}} create fireballs in their hands, or shoot them through their nostrils (sometimes by inhaling fireballs created in their own hands). Groups of goblins are involved in an ongoing turf war with groups of dwarves. They make their clothing from their own shed skin. In Book 3, Holly describes goblins as [...] "Evolution's little joke", with the reasoning, [...] "pick <b>the</b> <b>dumbest</b> creatures on the planet, and give them the ability to conjure fire". Notable goblins include General Scalene who was killed along with Julius Root in book 4, also a general in the goblin revolution and public enemy No.2 [...] (after Opal Koboi).
