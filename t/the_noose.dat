5|$|At the gallows, Beauchamp {{assured the}} {{assembled}} clergy {{that he had}} a salvation experience on July 6. Too weak to stand, he was held upright by two men while <b>the</b> <b>noose</b> was tied around his neck. At Beauchamp's request, the Twenty-Second Regiment musicians played Bonaparte's Retreat from Moscow while 5,000 spectators watched his execution. It was the first legal hanging in Kentucky's history. Beauchamp's father requested the bodies of his son and daughter-in-law for burial. The two bodies were placed in an embrace in a single coffin, as they had requested. They were buried in Maple Grove Cemetery in Bloomfield, Kentucky. The couple's tombstone was engraved with a poem written by Anna Beauchamp.|$|E
5|$|Group D, finally, was {{tasked with}} {{advancing}} south from its landing point to close off an escape route that ran between {{the sea and}} an inland lagoon towards the city of Hué. Landing at 04:30, the group made quick progress through the beach and dunes, secured the small city of Thé Chi Dong and hit the north coast of the lagoon by 05:30, thereby sealing off that escape route with no enemy contact. The final act of sealing <b>the</b> <b>noose</b> was to move some of the French Navy vessels north to the Vietnamese villages of Ba-Lang and An-Hoi where any attempt by Regiment 95 to flee by sea would have taken place.|$|E
5|$|Tarrare crossed Prussian lines {{under cover}} of darkness, {{disguised}} as a German peasant. Unable to speak German, he soon {{attracted the attention of}} local residents, who alerted the Prussian authorities, and he was captured outside Landau. A strip search found nothing suspicious on his person, and despite being whipped by Prussian soldiers, he refused to betray his mission. Brought before the local Prussian commander, General Zoegli, he again refused to talk and was imprisoned. After 24 hours of captivity, Tarrare relented and explained the scheme to his captors. He was chained to a latrine, and eventually, 30 hours after being swallowed, the wooden box emerged. Zoegli was furious when the documents, which Tarrare had said contained vital intelligence, transpired only to be deBeauharnais's dummy message, and Tarrare was taken to a gallows and <b>the</b> <b>noose</b> placed around his neck. (Some sources state that Zoegli never retrieved the box, as Tarrare had {{the presence of mind to}} recover and eat the stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians.) At the last minute, Zoegli relented, and Tarrare was taken down from the scaffold, given a severe beating, and released near the French lines.|$|E

6000|$|... "When {{we enter}} the houses," [...] {{he said to the}} two other lackeys, [...] "you will remain without with Pierre, and will take charge of the first four prisoners we bring out. Put <b>the</b> <b>nooses</b> round their necks, and draw them tight enough to let the men feel that they are there. Fasten the other ends to your saddles, and warn them, if they put up their hands to throw off <b>the</b> <b>nooses,</b> you will spur your horses into a gallop. That threat will keep them quiet enough." ...|$|R
5000|$|Contemporary traps {{are made}} of more modern materials, such as wire mesh cages with nooses made of nylon monofilament. The traps vary from 25-50 cm in {{diameter}} or length, with <b>the</b> <b>nooses</b> 4-12 cm in diameter. They are normally weighted {{to prevent them from}} being carried away by ensnared birds. [...] The live lure, or bait, animals used for the trap are usually rodents such as house mice. [...] The cage may have a double wall, or a removable roof or inner compartment, both to protect the bait animals from the raptors, and to prevent them damaging <b>the</b> <b>nooses</b> by chewing them.|$|R
5|$|Within {{a decade}} from the {{outbreak}} of the revolt in 869, the Zanj had seized most of lower Iraq, including the cities of Basra and Wasit, and expanded into Khuzistan as well. In 879 the death of the founder of the Saffarid state, Ya'qub al-Saffar, allowed the Abbasid government to fully concentrate its attention against the Zanj rebellion, and Abu'l-Abbas' appointment to command in December 879 at the head of 10,000 troops marks the turning point of the war. In the long and hard struggle that followed, which involved amphibious operations in the Mesopotamian Marshes, Abu'l-Abbas and his own military slaves (ghilmān)—of which the long-serving Zirak al-Turki was the chief—played the major role: although the Abbasid armies eventually swelled with reinforcements, volunteers, and Zanj defectors, it was the few but elite ghilmān who formed the army's backbone, filling its leadership positions and bearing the brunt of the battle, often under the personal command of Abu'l-Abbas. After years of gradually tightening <b>the</b> <b>noose</b> around the Zanj, in August 883 the Abbasid troops stormed their capital of al-Mukhtara, putting an end to the rebellion. A detailed account of the war, written by a former Zanj rebel and preserved in the history of al-Tabari, stresses the role of al-Muwaffaq and Abu'l-Abbas as the heroes who, in defence of the embattled Muslim state, suppressed the rebellion; the successful campaign would become a major tool in their propaganda effort to legitimize their de facto usurpation of the Caliph's power.|$|E
25|$|The short drop is {{performed}} {{by placing the}} condemned prisoner {{on the back of}} a cart, horse, or other vehicle, with <b>the</b> <b>noose</b> around the neck. The object is then moved away, leaving the person dangling from the rope. A ladder was also commonly used with the condemned being forced to ascend, after which <b>the</b> <b>noose</b> was tied and the ladder pulled away or turned, leaving the condemned hanging. Another method involves using a stool, which the condemned is required to stand on, being kicked away. The guards at the Stutthof concentration camp who were sentenced to death were executed by short-drop hanging; they were placed in <b>the</b> <b>noose</b> while standing or sitting on a truck, and the trucks were driven away.|$|E

5000|$|According to US Attorney Donald Washington, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{investigators}} {{found that the}} hanging of <b>the</b> <b>nooses</b> [...] "had all the markings of a hate crime". But, {{it could not be}} prosecuted as such since juveniles are rarely prosecuted in the federal system, and this offense did not meet departmental standards for charges to be brought. La Salle Parish District Attorney J. Reed Walters stated that Washington had found no federal statute under which the teens could be prosecuted, just as he had found no applicable state statute. Walters opined: [...] "The people that <b>the</b> <b>nooses</b> should be ashamed of what they unleashed on this town." ...|$|R
2500|$|Construction of {{the gallows}} for the hanging of the conspirators {{condemned}} to death began immediately on July 5, after the execution order was signed. It {{was constructed in}} the south part of the Arsenal courtyard, was [...] high and about [...] in size. Rath, who oversaw the preparations for the executions, made <b>the</b> <b>nooses.</b> Tired of making nooses and thinking {{that the government would}} never hang a woman, he made Surratt's <b>noose</b> <b>the</b> night before the execution with five loops rather than the regulation seven. He tested <b>the</b> <b>nooses</b> that night by tying them to a tree limb and a bag of buckshot and then tossing the bag to the ground (the ropes held). Civilian workers did not want to dig the graves out of superstitious fear, so Rath asked for volunteers among the soldiers at the Arsenal and received more help than he needed.|$|R
500|$|The {{following}} morning, {{students and}} staff discovered rope <b>nooses</b> hanging from <b>the</b> tree; reports differ as to whether there were two or three nooses. A black teacher described seeing both white and black students [...] "playing with , pulling on them, jump-swinging from them, and putting their heads through them" [...] that same day. Craig Franklin, assistant editor of The Jena Times, said <b>the</b> <b>nooses</b> were hung as a prank by three students directed at white members of the school rodeo team. The school's investigating committee had concluded that [...] "the three young teens had no knowledge that <b>nooses</b> symbolize <b>the</b> terrible legacy of the lynchings of countless blacks in American history." [...] The names of those who hung <b>the</b> <b>nooses</b> were not publicly disclosed.|$|R
25|$|The 1989 BBC series Shadow of <b>the</b> <b>Noose,</b> {{about the}} life of {{barrister}} Edward Marshall Hall, included what is portrayed as an abortive attempt on Hall's part to defend Crippen (played by David Hatton).|$|E
25|$|Jack McCall was hanged on March 1, 1877, {{and buried}} in a Roman Catholic {{cemetery}}. The cemetery was moved in 1881, and when his body was exhumed, <b>the</b> <b>noose</b> was found still around his neck.|$|E
25|$|Birger's name {{entered the}} news again in 2006 when the granddaughter {{of the sheriff}} who had {{supervised}} the execution sued the local historical museum {{in an attempt to}} regain possession of <b>the</b> <b>noose</b> used in the hanging.|$|E
60|$|But {{the arrows}} of the invaders {{were taking a}} much heavier toll than <b>the</b> <b>nooses</b> of <b>the</b> {{defenders}} and I foresaw that it was but {{a matter of time}} before Hooja's forces must conquer unless the brute-men changed their tactics, or the cave men tired of the battle.|$|R

60|$|Those {{who were}} hauled up {{within reach of}} the power-ful {{clutches}} of the defenders had <b>the</b> <b>nooses</b> snatched from them and were catapulted back through the first line to the second, where they were seized and killed by the simple expedient of a single powerful closing of mighty fangs upon {{the backs of their}} necks.|$|R
25|$|While {{playing in}} <b>The</b> <b>Noose,</b> Stanwyck {{reportedly}} {{fell in love}} with her married co-star, Rex Cherryman. Cherryman had become ill early in 1928 and his doctor advised him to take a sea voyage to Paris where he and Stanwyck had arranged to meet. While still at sea, he died of septic poisoning at the age of 31.|$|E
25|$|While {{the prize}} of {{capturing}} Geronimo in September 1886 went to Captain Henry Lawton, {{in command of}} B Troop, 4th Cavalry, the 10th Cavalry had drawn their part of <b>the</b> <b>noose</b> tight to make it happen. Bigelow and his troop {{were part of the}} escort taking Geronimo to the railroad station for his imprisonment back east.|$|E
25|$|Billy LaHiff, {{who owned}} a popular pub frequented by showpeople, {{introduced}} Ruby in 1926 to impresario Willard Mack. Mack was casting his play <b>The</b> <b>Noose,</b> and LaHiff suggested that {{the part of the}} chorus girl be played by a real one. Mack agreed, and after a successful audition gave the part to Ruby. She co-starred with Rex Cherryman and Wilfred Lucas. As initially staged, the play was not a success. In an effort to improve it, Mack decided to expand Ruby's part to include more pathos. <b>The</b> <b>Noose</b> re-opened on October 20, 1926, and {{became one of the most}} successful plays of the season, running on Broadway for nine months and 197 performances. At the suggestion of either Mack or David Belasco, Ruby changed her name to Barbara Stanwyck by combining the first name of her character, Barbara Frietchie, with the last name of another actress in the play, Jane Stanwyck.|$|E
6000|$|Mulcachy cursed. [...] "Here's where hell coughs," [...] he said. <b>The</b> <b>nooses</b> were {{introduced}} again. Again St. Elias, helpless {{on his side}} against and partly through the bars, had his nose punched. This time {{it was the other}} nostril. And hell coughed. As before, the moment he was released, he tore the ring out through his flesh.|$|R
60|$|In a jiffy I was trussed up as neatly as {{you might}} wish. One of <b>the</b> <b>nooses</b> dropped to my ankles and was jerked up with a suddenness that brought me to my face upon the ground. Then {{something}} heavy and hairy sprang upon my back. I fought to draw my knife, but hairy hands grasped my wrists and, dragging them be-hind my back, bound them securely.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{modification}} of <b>the</b> <b>noosed</b> fish method for trapping the White-Bellied Sea-Eagle Haliaeetus leucogaster. This technique provides a safe and inexpensive trapping method that may be applied in a water or land setting remote from the nest site. This versatility has great relevance where investigator disturbance may be an issue. Field evidence suggests the design may be readily adapted to suit other lake or coastally based Australian raptor species...|$|R

25|$|On 10 December 1941, Richter was hanged at Wandsworth Prison. A {{procedure}} that normally took around 15 seconds, took over 17 minutes. When Albert Pierrepoint, the executioner, entered Richter's cell to bind his wrists, Richter charged at the cell wall headfirst. After a struggle, Pierrepoint succeeded in binding Richter's wrists {{behind his back}} with a leather strap, but Richter's ferocious strength {{was so great that}} he split the leather strap and was free again. Four warders eventually subdued Richter and bundled him into the gallows chamber where a strap was fastened around his ankles, a hood placed over his head and <b>the</b> <b>noose</b> placed around his neck. Richter continued to fight and just as Pierrepoint pulled the lever that would open the trapdoors beneath Richter's feet, the condemned man jumped in the air. <b>The</b> <b>noose</b> slipped and almost came off Richter's head but caught under his nose. Richter had died instantly but not without a struggle.|$|E
25|$|Farouk was contemplating {{removing}} Naguib {{from his}} post when Egypt was thrown into turmoil following the 26 January Cairo Fires. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>noose</b> was beginning to tighten around the Free Officers, and investigations being carried out to uncover dissidents in the army. The executive committee of the Officers' Club was dissolved and the Free Officers brought their plans for a revolution three years forward, taking power in July 1952.|$|E
50|$|Construction of {{the gallows}} near the {{northeast}} corner of the Arsenal courtyard began immediately on July 5 after the execution order was signed. They were 12 ft high and the platform was about 20 sq ft in size. Captain Christian Rath, who oversaw the preparations for the executions, made <b>the</b> <b>nooses.</b> He tested <b>the</b> <b>nooses</b> that night by tying them to a tree limb and a bag of buckshot, then tossing the bag to the ground (the ropes held). Government officials decided to have the dead buried on site at the Arsenal, to avoid despoilation of the graves or their transformation into a Confederate shrine. Superstitious civilian workers did not want to dig the graves, so Rath asked for volunteers among the soldiers at the Arsenal and received more help than he needed. The graves, which lay against the east wall of the Arsenal, were 4 ft deep, 7 ft long, and 3 ft wide. Four wooden gun boxes were stacked near the graves to serve as coffins.|$|R
60|$|Numa {{was about}} to charge--there was little time in which to compare various methods or weigh the {{probable}} results of any. And then {{a number of things}} happened, almost simultaneously--the lion sprang from his ambush toward the retreating black--Tarzan cried out in warning--and the black turned {{just in time to see}} Numa halted in mid-flight by a slender strand of grass rope, <b>the</b> <b>noosed</b> end of which had fallen cleanly about his neck.|$|R
50|$|The word derrick {{became an}} eponym for the frame from which <b>the</b> hangman's <b>noose</b> was {{supported}} and through that usage (by analogy) to modern day cranes.|$|R
25|$|On January 8, 1864, David O. Dodd {{was brought}} to the grounds of his former school, St. John's, just east of the Little Rock Arsenal, for his hanging. A crowd of 5,000-6,000 {{gathered}} to watch. Dodd stood on the tailgate of a wagon under <b>the</b> <b>noose.</b> The executioner, named Dekay, fixed the rope around David's neck and the prop was knocked from under the tailgate. The rope stretched and the boy dangled, strangling to death over a full five minutes. Onlookers and Union soldiers became ill.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} Callum's hanging, he {{asks his}} guard, Jack, to deliver a letter to Sephy personally. Callum is then led to the gallows. He fails to find Sephy in the crowd before the hood is put on. He then hears Sephy shouting, 'I love you'. He shouts back, 'I love you too'. Sephy watches the {{trapdoor}} open and sees Callum's limp, lifeless body hanging from <b>the</b> <b>noose.</b> She hears Callum shouting to her but is unsure if she heard the word 'too' so she cannot be sure that Callum heard her.|$|E
25|$|After some {{search for}} the girl, I interviewed a nightclub dancer who had just scored in a small {{emotional}} part in a play that did not run (<b>The</b> <b>Noose).</b> She {{seemed to have the}} quality I wanted, a sort of rough poignancy. She at once displayed more sensitive, easily expressed emotion than I had encountered since Pauline Lord. She and (Hal) Skelly were the perfect team, and they made the play a great success. I had great plans for her, but the Hollywood offers kept coming. There was no competing with them. She became a picture star. She is Barbara Stanwyck.|$|E
