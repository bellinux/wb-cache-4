40|$|Four-vane high-current 81. 36 MHz RFQ {{structure}} with elliptic <b>coupling</b> <b>windows</b> {{has been developed}} in ITEP for Tera Watt Accumulator (TWAC) accelerator/storage ring complex with the laser ion source [1]. As the electrodynamics simulations show, this structure combines the high efficiency with the operating mode stability against asymmetric detuning and vanes misalignment. A considerable reduction of structure diameter due <b>to</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>windows</b> becomes important for low frequency range which is necessary for heavy ion acceleration. At the same time, the vane configurations allow the high duty factor operation. This paper will discuss mechanical design of present RFQ. 1...|$|R

Actor used perhaps the first pure object-oriented framework over native operating system calls as its basic GUI architecture. This allowed an Actor application to look and feel exactly like a Windows application written in C, {{but with all the}} advantages of an interactive Smalltalk-like development environment. Both a downside and upside to this architecture was a tight <b>coupling</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Windows</b> OS architecture, with a thin abstraction layer into objects. This allowed direct use of the rich Windows OS API, but also made it nearly impossible to support any other OS without a significant rewrite of the application framework.|$|R
40|$|In {{the second}} phase of a program to develop a compact {{accelerator}} based on a dielectric-loaded accelerating structure, we have conducted high power tests on a traveling-wave and a standing-wave prototype.

40|$|We {{investigate}} coherent electron-switching transport in {{a double}} quantum waveguide system in a perpendicular static or vanishing magnetic field. The finite symmetric double waveguide is connected to two semi-infinite leads from both ends. The double waveguide {{can be defined as}} two parallel finite quantum wires or waveguides <b>coupled</b> via a <b>window</b> <b>to</b> facilitate coherent electron inter-wire transport. By tuning the length of the <b>coupling</b> <b>window,</b> we observe oscillations in the net charge current and a maximum electron conductance for the energy levels of the two waveguides in resonance. The importance of the mutual Coulomb interaction between the electrons and the influence of two-electron states is clarified by comparing results with and without the interaction. Even though the Coulomb interaction can lift two-electron states out of the group of active transport states the length of the <b>coupling</b> <b>window</b> can be tuned to locate two very distinct transport modes in the system in the late transient regime before the onset of a steady state. A static external magnetic field and quantum-dots formed by side gates (side quantum dots) can be used to enhance the inter-waveguide transport which can serve to implement a quantum logic device. The fact that the device can be operated in the transient regime can be used to enhance its speed...|$|R

40|$|A {{deuteron}} radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) {{is being}} built by the RFQ group at Peking University. It is a very compact high-current RFQ, operating at 162. 5  MHz in continuous-wave mode. By optimizing the beam dynamics design, our simulations reached 98 % transmission efficiency for acceleration of the 50 -mA deuteron beam from 50  keV to 1  MeV, with an intervane voltage of 60  kV and a length of 1. 809  m. This RFQ adopts a window-type structure, with low power consumption and sufficient mode separation, with no stabilizing rods required. Its magnetic <b>coupling</b> <b>windows</b> have been optimized by both electromagnetic simulation {{and the construction of}} an equivalent circuit model. The empirical equation based on the circuit model provides a new way to evaluate the effect of the window size on the frequency. In addition, an aluminum model of the full-length RFQ has been built and tested, and the results show good agreement with the simulations. During the tuning process, the magnetic coupling effect between quadrants was found to be unique to the window-type RFQ. We also propose a method to estimate the effects of different degrees of electric field unflatness on the beam transmission. For the cooling system design, the results of thermostructural analysis, verified by comparing results from ansys and cst, show that the special cooling channels provide a high cooling efficiency around the magnetic <b>coupling</b> <b>windows.</b> The maximal deformation of the structure was approximately 75 [*][*]μm.

40|$|We {{study the}} Holstein model on a square lattice across the polaronic {{crossover}} {{by using an}} adiabatic approximation to compute the lattice distorted backgrounds and a Gaussian expansion in dynamical modes to compute phonon spectral properties. We capture phonon dynamics from the perturbatively renormalised weak <b>coupling</b> end <b>to</b> the `polaron insulator', addressing in particular the thermal evolution of spectral features in the crossover regime. In the weak coupling metal our results indicate validity of perturbation theory over a <b>coupling</b> dependent temperature <b>window,</b> with well-defined dispersive phonons. Deep in the polaronic insulator the phonon bandwidth is narrow and the detailed dispersion and damping depend {{on the degree of}} charge correlations. In the crossover regime, proximity to the polaronic instability leads to large fluctuation of the static distortions with increasing temperature. In this <b>coupling</b> <b>window</b> the electron system is pseudogapped, and phonons have the maximum bandwidth and damping - with the dispersion showing signature of short range charge order. We provide a detailed quantitative estimate of phonon properties in the adiabatic regime, suggest an universal `phonon phase diagram', and relate our results to recent neutron scattering observations in several oxides.

40|$|Convolutional Low-Density-Parity-Check (LDPC) {{ensembles}} {{have excellent}} performance. Their iterative threshold increases with their average degree, {{or with the}} size of the <b>coupling</b> <b>window</b> in randomized constructions. In the later case, as the window size grows, the Belief Propagation (BP) threshold attains the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) threshold of the underlying ensemble. In this contribution we show that a similar phenomenon happens for the growth rate of coupled ensembles. Loosely speaking, we observe that as the coupling strength grows, the growth rate of the coupled ensemble comes close to the concave hull of the underlying ensemble's growth rate. For ensembles randomly <b>coupled</b> across a <b>window</b> the growth rate actually tends to the concave hull of the underlying one as the window size increases. Our observations are supported by the calculations of the combinatorial growth rate, and that of the growth rate derived from the replica method. The observed concavity is a general feature of coupled mean field graphical models and is already present at the level of coupled Curie-Weiss models. There, the canonical free energy of the <b>coupled</b> system tends <b>to</b> the concave hull of the underlying one. As we explain, the behavior of the growth rate of coupled ensembles is exactly analogous. Comment: 5 pages, submitted to ISIT 201...|$|R
