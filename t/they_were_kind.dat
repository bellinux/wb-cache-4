500|$|Beck began {{life in a}} {{rooming house}} near {{downtown}} Los Angeles. As a child, {{he lived in a}} declining neighborhood just off Hollywood Boulevard. [...] "By the time we left there, they were ripping out miles of houses en masse and building low-rent, giant apartment blocks," [...] he later recalled. The lower-class family struggled financially, moving to Hoover and Ninth Street, a neighborhood populated primarily by Koreans and Salvadorian refugees. He was sent for a time to live with his paternal grandparents in Kansas, with Beck later remarking that [...] "I think <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> of concerned" [...] about his [...] "weird" [...] home life. Since his paternal grandfather was a Presbyterian minister, Beck grew up influenced by church music and hymns. Beck also spent time in Europe with his maternal grandfather, Al Hansen, a visual collage artist and a pioneer in the avant-garde Fluxus movement.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Eric Goldman {{praised the}} performances of John Slattery and Peyton List, and said the episode [...] "took three of the show's best characters and rocked their worlds in very different ways, telling three separate stories that were all utterly involving and moving, and delivering one of the show's best episodes ever in the process. This show continues to operate on a level few other series could dream of...". Roger Friedman of Forbes called the LSD sequences with Jane and Roger to be [...] "so well-written <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> of transcendent". Salon writer Nellie Engoron acclaimed the episode, while pointing out that [...] "with this episode’s tilt of the seesaw back to the older generation from the flailing youngsters, we’re reminded that while the 1960s saw a cultural shift towards youth, like a drunk, no historical change walks a straight line. For all the claims that Don and others have made that the “kids” increasingly hold the cards, the real truth (if we’re telling it) is that older white guys like Bert and Roger never truly lost power, even if they began to hide behind the scenes while fresh young faces took the public glory." ...|$|E
500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E

During a 2009 interview, Rose discussed his relationship with Kim, stating, [...] "My girl has finally {{decided to try to}} shoot for Playboy, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> enough to give her an opportunity to come to Houston for an interview, and we're excited about that."

2500|$|Speaking of the publicity, Lopez told MTV News: [...] "We try [...]" [...] "I'm {{not saying}} there's not times that we wish [...] {{could just be}} going to the movies and come out and there's not a crowd there waiting. You just want to spend your Sunday {{afternoon}} not working, {{but at the same time}} we both love what we do. If that's something that's part of it, then that's fine. We feel the love and we're very happy about it," [...] she stated. While speaking of the damage that could be caused, Lopez said: [...] "I think [...] if it's not a real thing. I've been in relationships where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> of unstable, and so the media messed with it a lot." [...] The overexposure from the media and public interest in their relationship resulted in less admiration for their work and negatively affected their careers.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1996, Westbrook's axing was {{reported}} in the press. According to press reports, producers had tired of her off-screen antics and were angered that she had appeared on the Channel 4 chat show, The Girlie Show, and had given away the outcome of a storyline she was involved with, a love-triangle between Sam, Ricky and his new girlfriend Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). The character departed for Spain on 26 March 1996 after falling for a Spanish tourist. Westbrook has since commented, [...] "The producers were very nice about it all. Rather than killing [...] off they sent her to Spain, once again leaving the door open for her to return [...] There was no official line as to why I was leaving, and when the announcement was made [...] <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>kind</b> enough to let me say in interviews that I was going because I wanted 'a change of direction'. 'Hopefully, one day I'll return to the show', I told journalists".|$|E
