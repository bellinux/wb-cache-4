5|$|In 1956, Ford {{tried to}} revive the Continental brand as a {{standalone}} line of ultra luxury automobiles, but abandoned the attempt after the 1957 model year, by which time around 3000 Mark II cars had been built. The failure was {{due in part to}} the price <b>tag</b> <b>of</b> $9695, an extraordinary amount of money for the time. The Continental thereafter became a successful car model under Ford's Lincoln brand.|$|E
5|$|Ford Australia's {{performance}} vehicle partner Ford Performance Vehicles {{produced a}} range of models based on the Falcon BA and marketed under the FPV name. The 2003 BA range included the GT, GT-P, and the Pursuit. The GT was the entry-level vehicle that started with a suggested retail price of A$59,810. The GT-P was the upmarket version of the GT, with a price <b>tag</b> <b>of</b> A$69,850. The Pursuit was a ute (utility) version of the GT, featuring the same seats, basic dash/interior package and wheels. FPV specific body-kits were applied to all cars, using the lights from the XR-range. The kit had a strong resemblance to the BA Falcon V8 Supercar, highlighting the connection to FPR.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{finished}} the league season {{without a single}} defeat and earned the <b>tag</b> <b>of</b> The Invincibles, a tag once given to the 1888–89 Preston North End team, the only previous team {{to go through a}} league season undefeated. Van Nistelrooy's missed penalty, therefore, was a crucial moment in Arsenal's season. The return fixture between the two sides at Highbury finished as a 1–1 draw and passed without incident. Manchester United finished in third place in the league table behind Chelsea but defeated Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final. Their run included a semi-final victory against Arsenal courtesy of a Paul Scholes goal. The following season, after Manchester United had brought Arsenal's unbeaten run to an end after 49 matches, the two clubs were involved in another incident at Old Trafford, variously dubbed the Battle of Old Trafford II, the Battle of the Buffet or simply the Battle of Old Trafford.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Gaalipata turned Ganesh {{into one of}} the most sought-after actors in Kannada cinema. He was already coming on the back of major {{commercial}} successes Mungaru Male (2006), Cheluvina Chittara (2007), and moderate successes Hudugaata (2007) and Krishna (2007). Yogaraj Bhat had delivered his two consecutive films that emerged as massive commercial successes, the other being Mungaru Male. Ganesh was seen in the film wearing a chain around the neck with a razor blade as the pendant. It became a trend among male fans. The film also proved to as a major break for Diganth who would go on to collaborate with Bhat frequently— Manasaare (2009), Pancharangi (2010) and Parapancha (2015). The nickname 'Doodh Peda' (an Indian sweet), by which Ganesh addresses to him as, in the film, came to be attached with his name in the media along with a <b>tag</b> <b>of</b> 'Chocolate Hero'. The film also proved to be a launchpad in the careers of actresses Neethu and Bhavana Rao.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Social tagging on online portals {{has become}} a trend now. It has {{emerged as one of}} the best ways of associating {{metadata}} with web objects. With the increase in the kinds of web objects becoming available, collabora-tive <b>tagging</b> <b>of</b> such objects is also developing along new dimensions. This popularity has led to a vast literature on social tagging. In this survey paper, we would like to summarize different techniques employed to study various aspects <b>of</b> <b>tagging.</b> Broadly, we would discuss about properties <b>of</b> <b>tag</b> streams, tagging models, tag semantics, generating recommendations using <b>tags,</b> visualizations <b>of</b> <b>tags,</b> applications <b>of</b> <b>tags,</b> integration <b>of</b> different <b>tagging</b> systems and problems associated with tagging usage.
