40|$|Young {{children}} often develop a partial, operational understanding of <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign {{that refers to}} completing an action, such as getting the answer to an addition or multiplication question, and fail to develop a relational understanding of <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign as a symbol that denotes equivalence. A partial view of <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign as an operator can {{be the result of}} primary-age pupils’ overexposure to canonical equations such as a+b=c. This paper presents a preliminary analysis of the different syntaxes and formats used to present equality statements in the Grade 1 textbooks in Greece. The quantitative analysis reveals an overemphasis on presenting <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign within canonical equations. However, qualitative analysis reveals that <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign is first introduced in a context that conveys the idea of equivalence relation and is presented within an interesting mix of symbolic and non-symbolic contexts which may minimise the tendency to interpret <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign exclusively as an operator...|$|R

40|$|A {{cumulative}} body {{of research}} has shown that children typically shift from an operational to a relational conception of <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign as they move through schooling. Jones (2008) argued that a truly relational conception of <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign comprises a substitutive component and a sameness component. Here we present two studies that build on this argument. The first investigated how <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign is typically presented to primary children in England, and we report that in the main an operational conception seems to be promoted. The second study measured the impact of a specially designed intervention on early secondary children’s conceptions of <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign. Pre- and post-test data revealed that the intervention promoted substitutive and sameness components of symbolic equivalence. We consider the theoretical and pedagogical implications of the results...|$|R

Chrysippus was, in effect, negating the law of excluded middle with respect to <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> and unequal, and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern infinitesimal calculus, namely, the limit and the process of convergence towards a limit.|$|E

Abortion was legalized in 1920, making the Soviet Union the first country to do so; however, it was banned again between 1936 and 1955.

Although the 67-year-old General Kutuzov was not seen by his contemporaries as <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> of Napoleon, he possessed the ability to muster a good defence. He was favoured over Barclay because he was Russian whereas Barclay was of Scottish descent and officers subordinate to Barclay could accept Kutuzov, thereby uniting the army. On 18 August Kutuzov arrived at Sarevo to greet the army.|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores children’s {{conceptions of}} <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign from <b>the</b> {{vantage point of}} notating task design. The {{existing}} literature reports that young children tend to view <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign as meaning “write the result here”. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} teaching an “is the same as” meaning leads to more flexible thinking about mathematical notation. However, these studies are limited because they do not acknowledge or teach children that <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign also means “can be exchanged for”. The thesis explores the “sameness” and “exchanging” meanings for <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign by addressing four research questions. The first two questions establish the distinction, in terms of task design, between the two meanings. Does the “can be exchanged for” meaning for <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign promote attention to statement form? Are the “can be exchanged for” and “is the same as” meanings for <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign pedagogically distinct? The final two research questions seek to establish how children might coordinate the two meanings, and connect them with their existing implicit knowledge of arithmetic principles. Can children coordinate “can be exchanged for” and “is the same as” meanings for <b>the</b> <b>equals</b> sign? Can children connect their implicit arithmetical knowledge with explicit transformations of notation? The instrument used is a specially designed notational computer-microworld called Sum Puzzles. Qualitative data are generated from trials with pairs of Year 5 (9 and 10 years), and in one case Year 8 (12 and 13 years), pupils working collaboratively with the microworld toward specified task goals. It is discovered that the “sameness” meaning is useful for distinguishing equality statements by truthfulness, whereas the “exchanging” meaning is useful for distinguishing statements by form. Moreover, a duality of both meanings can help children connect their own mental calculation strategies with transformations of properly formed notation.

5|$|It {{has been}} argued that this results in the {{different}} treatment of persons in like situations, and thus violates Article 12(1). Although a rational connection exists between the classification adopted and the legislative object, the effect of an under-inclusive classification is to accord different treatment to persons similarly placed. However, the courts have often justified under-inclusiveness on the ground that the legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm, to confine its restrictions to cases where the need is felt to be the greatest, and to advance its policies step by step. Despite this, resort to legislative wisdom to justify under-inclusiveness, if used indiscriminately, may result in the watering down of <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> protection guarantee provided by Article 12(1).|$|E
