5|$|New York Dolls is the 1973 debut studio album by the American {{hard rock}} band New York Dolls. By {{the time of}} the album's recording, the band had {{developed}} a following by playing regularly in lower Manhattan after forming in 1971. However, they were unappealing to record companies because of their onstage cross-dressing and vulgarity, while most record producers were reluctant <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> For shock value, the group was photographed in exaggerated drag on the album cover.|$|E
5|$|The Commission on Constitutional Revision {{presented}} {{its report}} and recommendations to Governor Godwin and the General Assembly in January 1969, and continued <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> {{to draft a}} final consensus version. The proposed Constitution was overwhelmingly approved by the voters of Virginia (who by then included African-American men and women, following passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s) and took effect on July 1, 1971.|$|E

5|$|When Sedaris and Dinello {{were offered}} the {{opportunity}} to create a television series for HBO Downtown Productions, Colbert left The Second City and relocated to New York <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> on the sketch comedy show Exit 57. The series debuted on Comedy Central in 1995 and aired through 1996. Although it lasted for only 12 episodes, the show received favorable reviews and was nominated for five CableACE Awards in 1995, in categories including best writing, performance, and comedy series.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} self-supporting, {{with its own}} engineer, signals, transport, and {{quartermaster}} sections. The signals section had a powerful but cumbersome Wireless Set No. 11 for communicating with the 7th Division. Powered by lead-acid batteries which were recharged with petrol generators, it required multiple signallers to carry and the noise was liable {{to attract the attention}} of the enemy. The platoons were equipped with the new Army No. 208 Wireless Sets. These were small, portable sets developed for the communication needs of units on the move in jungle warfare. However, the 2/6th Independent Company had not had time <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> operationally.|$|E
5|$|Too Much Too Soon is the 1974 second studio album by the American {{hard rock}} band New York Dolls. The group was {{dissatisfied}} with the recording of their 1973 self-titled debut album, leading the band's frontman David Johansen to enlist veteran producer Shadow Morton for Too Much Too Soon. Morton had become disenchanted by the music industry, but felt motivated by the band's energy and agreed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> as a challenge. They recorded the album the following year at A Studios in New York City.|$|E

50|$|He {{initially}} likely apprenticed {{with his}} father and brother (Cesare Filippi), and is thought <b>to</b> have <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> when they painted a processional standard Gonfalone for the Oratorio dell'Annunziata in Ferrara.

5|$|Subsistences online {{multiplayer}} component, titled Metal Gear Online, {{consists of}} five tournament-style game modes, {{each with a}} capacity of up to eight players. This mode pits players, each playing as a generic soldier {{against each other in}} deathmatch battles and variations of capture the flag, using stages, items, maneuvers, and units (such as the KGB, GRU or Ocelot Unit) from the main game. Depending on server settings, each round the highest-scoring player in each unit automatically assumes the role of one of the main characters (or Reiko Hinomoto from Rumble Roses), along with unique abilities and/or items. For example, the highest scoring player on the GRU team would assume the role of Major Raikov, leader of the GRU, next round. Konami's Metal Gear Online service for the PlayStation 2 closed in Japan on December 26, 2006, followed by in North America on April 2, 2007 and in Europe on October 30, 2007, although a fan community has revived it by emulating the servers. As noted above, the online mode, after one of the players unlocks an animal codename, also allowed for the player to play as either Reiko Hinomoto or Rowdy Reiko from Rumble Roses (depending if the player in question was of red team or blue team, respectively). According to Metal Gear series creator Hideo Kojima, he added the characters into the game as secret characters in part due to opportunity: Kojima had earlier been offered a deal with Rumble Roses producer Akari Uchida to make a crossover between Metal Gear and Rumble Roses. However, the Metal Gear development team at the time refused <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> Kojima eventually accepted the offer when trying to decide on secret characters for the online mode for Subsistence to tie up loose ends. He also admitted that he originally considered offering Tomonobu Itagaki, at the time the producer of the Tecmo fighting game series Dead or Alive, the opportunity of using one of his characters as a secret character.|$|E

50|$|Tom Leopold is an American comedy writer, performer, and novelist. He {{has written}} episodes of Seinfeld and Cheers, {{along with several}} books.

He also provided vocal performances with Jonathan Katz in animated productions for the Internet such as Hey, We're Back and Explosion Bus.|$|R
50|$|Estimates of {{the numbers}} of bees used in the {{production}} ranged between 15 million and 22 million, including 800,000 bees with their stingers removed to enable the cast <b>to</b> <b>work</b> safely <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> A total of 100 people were employed in the production to care for and transport the bees during the film shoot. Only one cast member, Olivia de Havilland, was stung during the production.|$|R
50|$|In June 2008, the Philippines {{was struck}} by Typhoon Frank which caused over 1,000 deaths. In an effort to assist the Philippines in {{identifying}} persons who perished {{as a consequence of}} this tragedy, Interpol invited ICMP <b>to</b> <b>work</b> together <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> provide assistance, thus invoking for the first time an agreement signed between ICMP and Interpol in November 2007 to respond jointly to disaster situations.|$|R
25|$|In 2001, {{the group}} went on hiatus, {{during which time}} Anselmo worked on side projects, such as Superjoint Ritual and Down. This caused more {{friction}} within the band, as the Abbott brothers kept waiting for Anselmo to become available <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> again. The frustration with Anselmo led to their decision to disband Pantera in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$ was {{produced}} by Ross Robinson, who {{was introduced to the}} band through Korn bassist Reginald Arvizu, who persuaded Robinson to listen to Limp Bizkit's demo. Robinson was impressed by the band's motivation and sound, and agreed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> The album showcased an intentionally abrasive, angry sound which the band felt would attract a fanbase.|$|E

From the bleeding effect, Desmond gains some of the Assassin skills of his predecessors at the cost of living with multiple sets of memories and personalities in his mind.|$|E
50|$|Shego {{has become}} the most popular villain of the series besides {{one of the most popular}} characters, and also one of the main character’s most popular love {{interests}} among fan art and fan fiction. Her popularity led the authors of the series to keep her, alongside Drakken, as one of the most recurring characters, even though they had intended <b>to</b> <b>work</b> less <b>with</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
50|$|Garbo was so {{impressed}} with Clarence Brown's direction and William Daniels's cinematography that she continued <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> both of <b>them</b> in her subsequent films at MGM. She was particularly insistent on the use of Daniels as her prime cinematographer.|$|R

His final total included $104,950 in cash.|$|R
25|$|The {{tendency}} for research to {{flow from the}} public {{to the private sector}} is confirmed by Ruben Sinisterra, a researcher at the Federal University of Minas Gerais who has been developing drugs to alleviate hypertension. Brazilian universities now have the capacity to develop nanoscale materials for drug delivery, he says, but ‘our domestic pharmaceutical companies don’t have internal capabilities in research and development, so we have <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> to push new products and processes out to market’.|$|E
25|$|Felten was {{an initial}} {{participant}} of the contest. He chose {{to opt out}} of confidentiality agreements that would have made his team eligible for the cash prize. Despite being given very little or no information about the watermarking technologies other than the audio samples and having only three weeks <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> Felten and his team managed to modify the files sufficiently that SDMI's automated judging system declared the watermark removed.|$|E
25|$|Baley has a {{flash of}} {{inspiration}} when he connects Enderby's emotional highs and lows to how close or far away Baley was to solving the murder, and obtaining a recording of the crime scene, manages to demonstrate that fragments of Enderby's glasses remain in situ. Given that the Spacers have already accepted that Sarton's death is unsolved, {{they are willing to}} not prosecute Enderby for the accident if he agrees <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> to promote colonization of other worlds amongst the Medievalists.|$|E

25|$|In {{open source}} {{software}} development, it's also common for projects {{to create their own}} licence under their own project name, but for the details of this licence to be a boilerplate copy from a well-known licence, or even a reference to this licence. A REL should support this, providing a means for licences to be defined by sub-classing existing licences and possibly changing their behaviour. Many of these licences are little more than vanity licences, although other dependent projects must still be able <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

25|$|The very {{conditions}} that may necessitate a stability operation or support operation—widespread human suffering, population movements, famine, human rights violations, and civil war—are also the {{conditions that}} attract the services of nongovernmental organizations (NGO) and private voluntary organizations (PVO). A PVO is a subset of NGO, and is a tax-exempt nonprofit that leverages expertise and private funding to address development challenges abroad. <b>To</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> effectively, HN and FID personnel {{need to understand that}} each organization or agency has a different mandate, set of capacities, organizational design, and cultural orientation.
