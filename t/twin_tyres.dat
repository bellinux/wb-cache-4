Due {{to the fact that}} there is a doubt in whether a 6 kg dry powder portable fire extinguisher will be sufficient to extinguish a severe fire in a <b>twin</b> <b>tyre,</b> the Directorate for Fire and Explosion Prevention in Norway has initiated a test programme at Norges branntekniske laboratorium as (NBL) for testing of different types of portable fire extinguishers against tyre fires. In addition, a literature study is carried out in order to obtain updated information concerning fire fighting of tyre fires. The objective of the test programme has been to achieve reliable information concerning the fire extinguishing efficiency of different fire extinguishants or agents and to select the best-suited portable fire extinguisher or agent agianst tyre fires. The experience gained from the project will be used in connection with a forthcoming revision of the ADR regulations.

40|$|PMC Harvesters Ltd is an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) for the pea {{and bean}} market. Their primary product {{line is a}} self {{propelled}} harvester known as the 979 CT harvester. The 979 CT is of considerable proportions being 4 m x 4 m x 12 m in overall dimensions, six wheel drive and weighs 29, 620 kg GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight) when fully laden. The aim of this work was to identify and outline possible solutions for the support system (tyre or track and undercarriage), quantify the performance of each system, produce a design and evaluation method to determine an optimal structural specification and to produce a design recommendation for the application. Analysis of the current 979 CT harvester wheel configuration highlighted many constraining factors in tyre choice. The most pertinent of these was that the wheels have a very limited operating space and following {{a study of the}} possible tyre options it became apparent only two manufactures, Michelin and Trelleborg, could provide tyres which met the vehicle parameters. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of the three chosen tyre options. From the findings of these tests {{it was clear that the}} optimal tyre for the PMC configuration was the Trelleborg <b>Twin</b> Radial <b>tyre,</b> operating at minimum road inflation pressure (1. 6 bar) as designated by Trelleborg. When operating the harvester in its normal working environment the tyre pressure should be set at minimum road inflation for in-field conditions with a DBD (Dry Bulk Density) of > 1. 3 g/cm 3, as excess damage caused by operating above minimum field operating pressure is superficial. The use of low compaction equipment such as CTIS (Central Tyre Inflation System) or tracks would not be beneficial to the PMC application. The track tested created a hardened track pan, thus requiring more effort to rectify post harvest. A CTIS increases the consumption of diesel and offered no reduction in soil compaction below plough depth as shown by the findings from operating the optimal tyre at minimum field inflation pressure (1. 2 bar). The primary objective of this project was to offer solutions to reduce the effects of the PMC harvester’s weight on its operating medium. The first natural step was to assess the vehicles main structure in order to improve its performance to weight ratio. The initial phase of this process was to validate the modelling and analyses techniques used to assess the structure. This was done within a controlled test environment at CU@S and from this work a factor of safety of 10 % was designated to be applied to all analysis in order to authenticate results and generate a “worst case” answer. Revisions of the main chassis, main pivot and rear axle assemblies were created and analysed. Test metrics were defined which represented operating patterns of the harvester. The findings from these tests saw a 22. 6 % weight reduction, 43. 1 % increase in life expectancy and 10. 2 % reduction in peak stress in the main chassis and main pivot. Unlike the other two key assemblies, the rear axle was deemed fit for purpose and would not benefit from any further design changes...|$|R

Bigger payloads required a four-wheeled float, and the Freighliner was showcased at the 1966 Royal Dairy Show. It came as a 50 cwt model and <b>twin</b> <b>tyres</b> were fitted on the rear axle. In order to retain the manoeuvrability of the three-wheeled vehicles, the front springs and steering drag link were placed inside the frames, which allowed a kerb-to-kerb turning circle of 30 ft to be achieved. The wheelbase was 7.75 ft, with the cab located in front of the front wheels, to give easy access to the driving position. Three models were available, with top speeds of 14 mph, 17 mph and 20 mph. The working range was from 30 to 40 mi, and a series resistance controller was fitted as standard, although the model at the Dairy Show had a thyristor control unit.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with producing a simple method to design low volume roads (LVR) {{by means of a}} rationale which accounts for permanent deformation development in granular layers. Rutting is regarded as the main distress mode in unsealed and thinly sealed pavements. Hence, it is desirable that it be analytically approached rather than empirically, as in most design methods. The overall aim of this PhD thesis was to look into the behaviour of in-service roads and from a newly developed process, to advance, in a systematic manner, the elements required to produce a simple mechanistic design procedure. The study took as its basis an assessment of the proximity of the stress distribution in the pavement to the material’s failure envelope. After a literature review on unbound granular materials mechanical behaviour and on low volume roads pavement design methods, Chapters 4 and 5 discuss full scale trials carried out in Scotland on typical forest roads. The overall goal of the trials carried out within the Roads Under Timber Transport project was to establish the effect of weather and seasonal effects on the rutting of forest roads and to improve their performance while enabling the roads to be economically constructed and maintained. It appears that most of the rutting occurring in the sites surveyed came shortly after their construction/resurfacing, leading to the assumption that workmanship may be a highly important variable. Lack of compaction of the layer {{could be one of the}} likely reasons for the high initial rutting rates. Establishing the effect of weather on rutting further to the existing knowledge was, however, difficult to achieve; this was mainly due to the difficulties faced in monitoring traffic conditions. A newly developed method was needed to quantify permanent deformation development due to wandering traffic on a non-level pavement; this was achieved by the use of wheel path areas, and seemed to be a way forward in the analysis of rutting in unsealed roads. Accelerated pavement trials are reported that aimed to evaluate the performance of aggregate under soaked conditions and the relative pavement deformation caused by different timber haulage vehicles. A road segment simulating a standard forest road section was constructed in a purpose-built facility located at the Ringour Quarry facility. Ten different trials were carried out combining three different aggregate materials and five types of vehicles. Tyre fitment, axle configuration and tyre pressure were assessed and demonstrated to play an important role on the study of rutting development. Conclusions drawn from the results suggest that management of the tyre inflation pressure and axle overload may be one of the most economic means of managing pavement deterioration in the forest road network. A mechanistic analysis of a variety of unsealed pavements was carried out in Chapter 6; and the newly proposed methodology is described in Chapter 7. With changing loading conditions – e. g. as a consequence of the introduction of Tyre Pressure Control Systems and super single tyres – more detailed analyses are required, so that their effect can be analytically assessed. Then an analytical method is introduced for evaluating the stress-strain condition in thinly surfaced or unsurfaced pavements as typically used in LVR structures. It aims to improve the understanding of the effect of tyre pressure and contact area in regard to permanent deformation. To achieve this, several scenarios were modelled using Kenlayer software varying aggregate material, thickness, stiffness, tyre pressure & arrangement. The results usually show a fairly well defined locus of maximum stresses. By comparing this stress envelope with failure envelope, conclusions could be established about the more damaging effect of super singles over <b>twin</b> <b>tyres</b> and, likewise, the greater damage inflicted by high tyre pressures compared to that incurred by lower tyre pressures. Finally, the framework of the proposed method contributes to LVR pavement design procedures mainly due to its simplicity. It still treats the pavement analytically, permitting a more fundamental description of the behaviour of granular layers than in simple linear elastic analysis, but by simplifying the elasto-plastic analysis for routine use it thereby reduces demands of material characterization and computational skills, thus increasing its utility in practical application.
