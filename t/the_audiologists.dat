40|$|Audiological {{rehabilitation}} is {{a complex}} process and can involve medical, educational, psychological, social and technical proceedings. <b>The</b> <b>audiologist's</b> part in this process is essential. The {{purpose of the study}} was twofold: to describe <b>the</b> <b>audiologist's</b> working process and to explore patient records written by audiologists according to structure, content and comprehensiveness. Method. Out of rules and regulations, code of ethics and literature concerning audiological rehabilitation from <b>the</b> <b>audiologist's</b> point of view, a model for <b>the</b> <b>audiologist's</b> working process was developed. Intuitive classification formed a general structure, which was filled with content from the literature corresponding to the working process. An audit instrument, based on the presented model, was developed and used in reviewing 85 records written by audiologists from 17 audiological clinics. In all 360 notes were reviewed. The data was analysed by content analysis and emerged from seven areas with altogether 30 aspects. The areas were: formal structure, language, influencing factors, assessment/planning, implementation, evaluation, participation and process. Each aspect was marked and the individual record could achieve a total of 60 points. The result presents <b>the</b> <b>audiologist's</b> working model in words and graphs and shows the complexity of the working process. The result of the review of records revealed severe deficiencies in the practice of <b>the</b> <b>audiologist's</b> documentation and <b>the</b> implementation of current rules and regulations. The total points for the records differed from 8 to 41 with a mean of 24. 3. Of the 11 aspects relating to current rules and regulations there were only 4 represented in more than half of the records. Since the majority of the records did not have goals, treatment planning or evaluation according to the goals, they were assumed not to be good for quality evaluation. A clear connection to <b>the</b> <b>audiologist's</b> working process as presented in the model could only be seen in a few records. Implications. In order to follow the law and in striving to be registrated <b>audiologists</b> and enchance <b>the</b> standing of <b>the</b> <b>audiologist</b> profession <b>the</b> documentation ought to be improved, especially in concern with the patient's different status, describing the situations of handicap, goals, treatment planning, psychological implementations and evaluation according to the goals...|$|R

The purpose of this study was to examine the audiologists’ views on the exercise of their profession in the light of the present laws and guidelines. A qualitative method, inspired by the fenomenologic tradition, was choosen for this study. In the study interviews were conducted with five audiologists who work with diagnosis and rehabilitation at different hospitals in Western Sweden. From the interviews we constructed ten descriptive cathegories which deal with views on demands, conditions, the will to work as demanded and on the continued development of the profession. Our results show that <b>the</b> <b>audiologists</b> feel that they have been given a personal responsibility for their work. <b>The</b> <b>audiologists</b> believe that they are given the basic conditions for meeting the demands put on them, although they have felt that these conditions have been changing for the worse and they express an unease about the conditions continuing to detoriate.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{clinical}} settings show that patients exhibit an orientation towards an institutional restriction against them proposing treatment solutions for their medical condition. In this paper we demonstrate how that restriction is relaxed {{in a particular}} clinical setting, that of audiology. Focusing on video-recorded interactions in a Danish audiology clinic, we show how patients freely offer suggestions for their own treatment, even in cases where a treatment solution has already been provided by <b>the</b> <b>audiologist.</b> We further illustrate how audiologists respond to patients 2 ̆ 7 treatment proposals with concessions, through which <b>the</b> <b>audiologist</b> manages to accept the patient 2 ̆ 7 s treatment proposal as a possibility, while withholding any professional endorsement of the proposed treatment.

The lifting of the restriction on patients proposing their own treatments thus brings into relief two other institutional restrictions within the audiology clinic: (a) a restriction on audiologists rejecting patients 2 ̆ 7 treatment suggestions outright, and (b) a restriction on patients 2 ̆ 7 straightforward acceptance of treatments that are not fully endorsed by <b>the</b> <b>audiologist...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop and examine a list of {{potential}} variables that may account for variability in the dispensing rates of four common hearing aid features.

The potentially associative variables then were examined using regression analyses from the responses of 257 audiologists to a dispensing practice survey. There was a direct relation between price and level of hearing aid technology with the frequency of dispensing product features. There was also a direct relation between the belief by <b>the</b> <b>audiologist</b> that a feature might benefit patients and the frequency of dispensing that feature. In general, the results suggested that personal differences among <b>audiologists</b> and <b>the</b> hearing aids <b>audiologists</b> choose to dispense are related more strongly to dispensing rates of product features than to differences in characteristics of the patient population served by audiologists. An additional finding indicated that evidence-based practice recommendations were inversely related to dispensing rates of product features.

Responses of audiologists were analyzed to determine: a) adequacy of CPT codes; b) average time to perform various audiologic tests; c) impact managed care onclinical practice; and d) changes in reimbursement as a result of managed care. The survey was designed to determine the type of work setting, typical job duty, average monthly caseload and hours per day spent on patient care for each respondent. The survey with a cover letter explaining the purpose was mailed to 93 audiologists in clinical setting in the state of Florida.

40|$|Objective: The study {{examined}} the self-reported psychosocial work environment for audiologists working in three practice types (public, completely private, and private but publicly funded). Design: A cross-sectional e-mail survey using the demand-control-support questionnaire, a short version of the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) questionnaire, and descriptive data. Study sample: Five-hundred Swedish licensed audiologists. Results: Overall, the results indicate differences in psychosocial work environment pertaining to the practice types. These differences are small and the type explains few percent of the variability accounted in the measures of psychosocial work environment. Social support seems important for the psychosocial work environment and is considered a reward in itself. Using the demand-control model, 29 % of <b>the</b> <b>audiologists</b> reported working in a high-stress psychosocial work environment.

Audiologists are particularly vulnerable to the changing requirements of the discipline that compel them to straddle both professional obligations and business principles, creating a ‘hybrid’ professional. METHOD : A two-phase mixed method approach was used to analyse publications. Publications were sorted into categories, namely approach to ethics, author, decade, role of <b>the</b> <b>audiologist,</b> component of morality, and common themes. The sample consisted of peer-reviewed papers cited in MEDLINE, CINAHL, ERIC, MasterFILE Premier, E-Journals, Africa-Wide Information and Academic Search Premier electronic database indexes, as well as non-peer-reviewed papers in the Seminars in Hearing professional journal.

Audiologic tests that use the sentences as stimulus, have been objects of research, because besides check the real hearing abilities from the patient, provide a direct approach with situations of communications and provide information that will guide the more adequate conduct to be indicated for the individual with hearing complaints. Objective: Determine the thresholds of recognition of sentences in silence and the relation sign/noise {{in a group of}} individual carriers of the bilateral neurosensory hearing loss and symmetric from moderate degree. Method: Retrospective study, clinic and experimental. Were evaluated 50 individuals, being 16 adults of middle age and 34 elderly. Was performed a anamnesis and the basic audiological evaluation.

40|$|Audiologists {{managing}} {{children with}} auditory processing disorders (APD) encounter challenges that include conflicting definitions, several classification profiles, problems with differential diagnosis {{and a lack}} of standardised guidelines. The heterogeneity of the disorder and its concomitant childhood disorders makes diagnosis difficult. Linguistic and cultural issues are additional challenges faced by South African audiologists. The study aimed to describe the practices, challenges and recommendations of South African audiologists managing children with APD. A quantitative, non-experimental descriptive survey was used to obtain data from 156 audiologists registered with the Health Professions of South Africa. Findings revealed that 67 % screened for APD, 42 % assessed while 43 % provided intervention. A variety of screening and assessment procedures were being administered, with no standard test battery identified. A range of intervention strategies being used are discussed. When the relationship between the number of years of experience and the audiologists’ level of preparedness to practice in the field of APD was compared, a statistically significant difference (p = 0. 049) was seen in that participants with more than 10 years of experience were more prepared to practice in this area. Those participants having qualified as speech-language therapists and audiologists were significantly more prepared (p = 0. 03) to practice than <b>the</b> <b>audiologists</b> who comprised the sample. Challenges experienced by the participants included the lack of linguistically and culturally appropriate screening and assessment tools and limited normative data.

The aim of this quality initiative study was to evaluate the quality of the newborn hearing screening program {{in the context of a}} newly implemented Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative Program at Summa Health System Akron City Hospital. The goals were (1) to determine whether screening environment (mother’s room vs. nursery) affected screening results, (2) to identify challenges and positive outcomes encountered by <b>the</b> <b>audiologists,</b> and (3) to ensure that Pass/Refer rates met state standards. A Quest Technologies sound level meter (Model 1800; St. Paul, MN, USA) was used to measure noise levels in the nursery rooms where newborns were tested. The length of screening time was determined using a calibrated SP® Traceable® (ISO 17025) stopwatch (McGraw Park, IL, USA). Pass/Refer rates and observed challenges and benefits were noted. All well-baby infants born in the month of February 2013 (n = 101) were included, and Pass/Refer results were compared to those in years 2008 - 2012. Noise levels in the mother’s room did not appear to negatively affect the Pass/Refer rates. Some challenges were present, including interruptions and louder environmental noise. This protocol was considered appropriate for assessing a hearing screening program in a Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) setting. Benefits of performing hearing screening in the mother’s room included test transparency for parents and the ability to immediately discuss the results.

We highlight {{the ways in which}} the hardware and software <b>the</b> <b>audiologist</b> uses to adjust the settings on the patient’s hearing aid are not designed with their necessary use within the consultation’s interaction in mind. Rather, the technology is designed for use by a single user with audiological training. Furthermore, the local interactional context (in the consultation) in which the technology is used creates difficulties for patients to follow the course of their own treatment. For example, the relevance of the audiologists’ actions with the technology is often not available to the patient. Patients cannot know (due to both the arrangement of the computer and the technical sophistication of the software’s interface) whether or not <b>the</b> <b>audiologist</b> is actually addressing their problem when doing something with the technology. We argue that the technology is much more than simply a professional medical tool that mediates an adequate solution to patients’ difficulties. The move towards “patient-centred” design of technologies must appreciate the variety of roles of these technologies in the consultation. Such roles of the technology in a consultation include patient education, explanation, demonstration, and the medical professional’s justification of treatment decisions. In making these observations, we suggest that the existing design and use of technology can marginalise patients’ own participation in their treatment...|$|R
