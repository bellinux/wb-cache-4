25|$|Prayer: Both {{traditional}} Muslims and the Nation of Islam {{believe that}} the five daily prayers (salat) are mandatory. The leader of the NOI, Elijah Muhammad, was once quoted as saying to his followers <b>that</b> <b>prayer</b> is 'necessary for spiritual advancement'.|$|E
50|$|The {{church does}} not believe <b>that</b> <b>prayers</b> to the dead are in order and {{therefore}} it dissuades the practice. It believes <b>that</b> <b>prayers</b> should be directed to God instead, though one can be thankful {{for the life of}} a deceased person.|$|R

25|$|Some anthropologists {{believe that}} the {{earliest}} intelligent modern humans practiced a form of prayer. Today, most major religions involve prayer {{in one way or}} another; some ritualize the act, requiring a strict sequence of actions or placing a restriction on who is permitted to pray, while others teach <b>that</b> <b>prayer</b> may be practiced spontaneously by anyone at any time.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} {{and nature of}} sacrifices in Judaism {{are based on the}} 613 commandments, theology and halakha. According to the Jewish perception the coming of the messiah will not remove the requirement to keep the 613 commandments. Most Orthodox Jews believe that animal sacrifice will be resumed once the Third Temple is built, others believe <b>that</b> <b>prayer</b> and tzedakah will suffice.|$|E
25|$|Under the Hanbali School of thought, {{a person}} who doesn't pray {{five times a day}} is an unbeliever. The other three Sunni schools of thought say that the person who doesn't pray five times a day is an unholy sinner. Those who {{prescribe}} to the Hanbali view cite a hadith from Sahih Muslim that states <b>that</b> <b>prayer</b> is a dividing line between a believer and a non-believer.|$|E

50|$|The Bahá'í teachings state <b>that</b> {{individual}} <b>prayer</b> {{should be}} performed when one is alone, and when free of distractions such as {{early in the morning}} or late at night. Collective prayers, which usually are performed by individuals taking turns in reading prayers, are also encouraged; collective prayers are usually performed at the beginning of meetings such as Nineteen Day Feasts, and Bahá'í administrative meetings. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá'í Faith {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, wrote <b>that</b> <b>prayers</b> may be addressed to God, Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, or other messengers from God; he recommended, however, <b>that</b> the <b>prayers</b> be addressed to Bahá'u'lláh.|$|R
25|$|The {{source of}} the supplicatory prayer (Taḥanun) is in Daniel (9:3) and I Kings (8:54), where the verses {{indicate}} <b>that</b> <b>prayer</b> should always be followed by supplication. Based on this, Talmudic sages developed the habit of adding a personal appeal to God following the set prayers (some examples {{are listed in the}} Babylonian Talmud, Berachot 16b). In the fourteenth century, these spontaneous supplications were standardized and turned into the prayer of Tachanun.|$|E
25|$|A {{very small}} {{preliminary}} {{study published in}} 2016 shows <b>that</b> <b>prayer</b> helps people who have achieved sobriety in Alcoholics Anonymous reduce cravings for alcohol. The study used a MRI machine to scan how subjects reacted to images of people drinking. The study randomly assigned the subjects, so that some subjects saw the images after saying prayers in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous; others after reading newspaper articles. The people who had just seen the prayers reported feeling fewer cravings for alcohol; the MRI scans of their brains confirmed {{that there was a}} different reaction.|$|E
25|$|Pentecostals believe <b>that</b> <b>prayer</b> {{is central}} in {{receiving}} healing. Pentecostals look to scriptures such as James 5:13–16 for direction regarding healing prayer. One can pray for one's own healing (verse 13) {{and for the}} healing of others (verse 16); no special gift or clerical status is necessary. Verses 14–16 supply the framework for congregational healing prayer. The sick person expresses his or her faith by calling for the elders of the church who pray over and anoint the sick with olive oil. The oil {{is a symbol of}} the Holy Spirit.|$|E
25|$|The Burbank City Council lost a {{court case}} in 2000 {{involving}} the right to begin meetings with a sectarian prayer. A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge ruled <b>that</b> <b>prayers</b> referencing specific religions violated the principle of {{separation of church and}} state in the First Amendment. While invocations were still allowed, Burbank officials were required to advise all clerics <b>that</b> sectarian <b>prayer</b> as part of Council meetings was not permitted under the Constitution.|$|R

25|$|The {{issue of}} school prayer remains {{contentious}} even where courts {{as diverse as}} those in Canada, the United States, Russia, and Poland attempt {{to strike a balance}} between religious and secular activity in state-sponsored arenas. Some arguments have held that religion in schools is both an effective sociomoral tool as well as a valuable means to psychological stability. On the opposing side, others have argued <b>that</b> <b>prayer</b> has no place in a classroom where impressionable students are continually subject to influence by the majority. The latter kind of claim holds that, to the extent that a public school itself promotes the majority religion, the state is guilty of coercive interference in the lives of the individual.|$|E
25|$|Some {{controversy}} {{surrounded the}} issue of whether the cross atop the dome until 1915 should be replaced. Some Armenians said that the renovation was unfinished until the cross was replaced, and <b>that</b> <b>prayer</b> should be allowed inside at least once a year. A cross had been prepared nearly a year before the opening, and Mesrob II petitioned the Prime Minister and Minister of Culture to place the cross on the dome of the cathedral. Turkish officials said that the base was not appropriate for the cross the Patriarchate brought as it was made to support the original cross. Later, the issue was solved. Since October 2, 2010, the cross sits {{at the top of the}} church.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies of}} prayer {{effectiveness}} have yielded null results. A 2001 double-blind {{study of the}} Mayo Clinic found {{no significant difference in}} the recovery rates between people who were (unbeknownst to them) assigned to a group that prayed for them and those who were not. Similarly, the MANTRA study conducted by Duke University found no differences in outcome of cardiac procedures as a result of prayer. In another similar study published in the American Heart Journal in 2006, Christian intercessory prayer when reading a scripted prayer was found to have no effect on the recovery of heart surgery patients; however, the study found patients who had knowledge of receiving prayer had slightly higher instances of complications than those who did not know if they were being prayed for or those who did not receive prayer. Another 2006 study suggested <b>that</b> <b>prayer</b> actually had a significant negative effect on the recovery of cardiac bypass patients, resulting in more frequent deaths and slower recovery time for those patient who received prayers.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{cultural}} implications {{and the importance of}} bearing children, infertility in Ghana can be devastating. Throughout the years, Ghanaians have believed that both physical and spiritual ailments are the cause of infertility. Some people believe that a womb could be too hot or too cold to support a developing baby. Others believe that the cause of their infertility is witchcraft, and this belief is often supported by traditional priests who assert that the woman can be rid of a witch's curse and be allowed to conceive if the priest performs a rite in which he asks fertility gods how they can be appeased. Other spiritual beliefs involving infertility include the belief that infertility {{is the result of a}} woman's disobedience to God, in which the remedy is prayer and repentance. Women who consult a tradition birth attendant are likely to be told <b>that</b> <b>prayer</b> is the medicine for infertility, although they acknowledge that infertility is sometimes caused by a physical ailment. In these cases, the traditional birth attendant may blame the infertility on stomach aches and advise the woman to visit a hospital and take the medicine given by the doctor.|$|E
25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, <b>that</b> <b>prayer</b> to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

500|$|Bayh {{continued}} to campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire as November 2005 approached. Media outlets reported that 10 potential presidential candidates had visited Iowa in October. When {{asked about the}} attention given to the state 26 {{months prior to the}} caucus, Bayh replied that he [...] "wish the process didn't begin this early, but it does". Later in the month, former chief counsel and master political strategist for Bayh, Federal District Judge David Hamilton ruled <b>that</b> <b>prayer</b> could not be conducted prior to the opening of the state legislature in Indiana, reasoning that the mention of [...] "Jesus Christ" [...] as [...] "Savior" [...] or [...] "Son of God" [...] is unconstitutional. Commentators argued that the decision diminished Bayh's label as the [...] "centrist candidate" [...] for the Democratic nomination due to his connections to the judge.|$|E
500|$|The Sages of the Talmud {{stated that}} anyone who prays at the Temple in Jerusalem, [...] "it is {{as if he has}} prayed before the throne of glory because the gate of heaven is {{situated}} there and it is open to hear prayer." [...] Jewish Law stipulates that the Silent Prayer should be recited facing towards Jerusalem, the Temple and ultimately the Holy of Holies, as God's bounty and blessing emanates from that spot. It is generally believed <b>that</b> <b>prayer</b> by the Western Wall is particularly beneficial since it was that wall which was situated closest to the Holy of Holies. Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger writes [...] "since the gate of heaven is near the Western Wall, it is understandable that all Israel's prayers ascend on high there... {{as one of the great}} ancient kabbalists Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla said, when the Jews send their prayers from the Diaspora in the direction of Jerusalem, from there they ascend by way of the Western Wall." [...] A well-known segula (efficacious remedy) for finding one's soulmate is to pray for 40 consecutive days at the Western Wall, a practice apparently conceived by Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov Fisher.|$|E
500|$|In 1980, the General Council of the Assemblies of God {{criticized the}} {{doctrine}} of positive confession, noting examples of negative confessions in the Bible (where Biblical figures express fears and doubts) that had positive results and contrasting these examples with the focus on positive confessions taught by prosperity theology. The Council argues that the biblical Greek word often translated as [...] "confess" [...] literally translates as [...] "to speak the same thing", and refers to {{both positive and negative}} confessions. The statement also criticizes the doctrine for failing to recognize the will of God: God's will should have precedence over the will of man, including their desires for wealth, and Christians should [...] "recognize the sovereignty of God". The statement further criticizes prosperity theology for overlooking the importance of prayer, arguing <b>that</b> <b>prayer</b> should be used for all requests, not simply positive confession. The Council noted that Christians should expect suffering in this life. They urge readers to apply practical tests to positive confession, arguing that the doctrine appeals to those who are already in affluent societies but that many Christians in other societies are impoverished or imprisoned. Finally, the paper criticizes the distinction made by advocates of prosperity theology in the two Greek words that mean [...] "speaking", arguing that the distinction is false and that they are used interchangeably in the Greek text. The Council accused prosperity theology of taking passages out of context to fulfill its own needs, with the result that doctrine of positive confession is contradictory to the holistic message of the Bible.|$|E
