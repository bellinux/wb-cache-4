5|$|In 1983, {{dendrochronology}} of wood {{samples from}} Chetro Ketl provided information on species selected, season of cutting, wood modification and use, {{as well as}} an estimate of the number of trees required to build the great house. Trees were harvested for construction at Chetro Ketl annually, which contrasts with the sporadic patterns found at other sites in the canyon. Whereas a late summer and early fall harvesting time has been documented at other Chacoan sites, the <b>tree</b> <b>felling</b> for Chetro Ketl was undertaken primarily during the spring and early summer. This may indicate that enough in-house labor was available during the farming season, or that specialized groups of Chacoans were dedicated to <b>tree</b> <b>felling</b> irrespective of the agriculture cycle, when most others were busy with field preparation and planting. One particularly well sampled room suggests that wood was cut during the relatively short span of a couple of weeks per season.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield has a reputed 2 million {{trees and}} was once {{described}} as the greenest city in Europe, however since Sheffield City Council signed a controversial 25 year PFI contract with Amey plc in 2012 an aggressive programme of highway <b>tree</b> <b>felling</b> has been implemented across the city, resulting in widespread local protests.|$|E
5|$|A severe drought from 1130 to 1180 led {{to rapid}} {{depopulation}} {{in many parts}} of the San Juan Basin, particularly at Chaco Canyon. As the extensive Chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to Mesa Verde, causing major population growth in the area. This led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for Mesa Verdeans, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. In order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming. Population increases also led to expanded <b>tree</b> <b>felling</b> that reduced habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the Mesa Verdeans had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} of early human activity in the Birmingham area dating back 10,000 years, with stone age artefacts suggesting seasonal settlements, overnight hunting parties and woodland activities such as <b>tree</b> <b>felling.</b> The many burnt mounds that can still be seen around the city indicate that modern humans first intensively settled and cultivated the area during the bronze age, when a substantial but short-lived influx of population occurred between 1700BC and 1000BC, possibly caused by conflict or immigration in the surrounding area. During the 1st-century Roman conquest of Britain, the forested country of the Birmingham Plateau formed a barrier to the advancing Roman legions, who built the large Metchley Fort {{in the area of}} modern-day Edgbaston in AD48, and made it the focus of a network of Roman roads.|$|E
25|$|Fire {{is one of}} {{the major}} threats facing forests in Kerala. People engaged in grazing {{livestock}} often burn an area to get fresh grass shoots for their cattle, especially during dry season when fire danger is greatest. Also, illicit activities like ganja cultivation, poaching, <b>tree</b> <b>felling,</b> non timber forest products (NTFP) collection and very often careless tourists and pilgrims are responsible for big forest fires.|$|E
25|$|The {{site was}} {{assessed}} by English Nature as in an unfavourable but recovering condition in 2005. Management of the area by the National Trust has aimed, since 1992, to promote heathland regeneration by preventing encroachment by birches, scrub and bracken. Strategies used include bracken rolling, clearing birch scrub and removing some older trees from heathland areas. Grazing with cattle is employed in summer. Tree clearance, has, however, resulted in conflict between the trust and a local residents group, Friends of Bickerton Hill, which organised a protest on the hill in October 2008 against <b>tree</b> <b>felling,</b> especially in the picturesque Cuckoo Rock Valley.|$|E

25|$|Between May 13–14, 2004 {{the site}} was {{enclosed}} with temporary mesh fencing and plain-clothed security guards commenced patrols of the public areas. At 02:00 on May 15 bulldozers arrived at the site and tree-felling began at 07:00. The work caused immediate concern to nearby residents who feared the work might unsettle asbestos deposits in the ground. Residents formed the Save Spodden Valley action group the following week. Residents also protested to Rochdale Council, which subsequently issued an emergency tree preservation order on six parts of the site, preventing the removal of trees without permission of planning officers, and carrying a fine of up to £20,000 per tree. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) also secured a voluntary arrangement to halt any work that could disturb soil on the site pending soil sampling. Former Turner's employees and local residents claimed that, {{as recently as the}} 1960s, asbestos dust and fibres were clearly visible hanging from the trees, and that a disused coalmine shaft exposed by the <b>tree</b> <b>felling</b> had been used over a period of decades to dump hundreds of tonnes of asbestos waste.|$|E
500|$|The {{trend in}} {{improved}} graphics continued {{well into the}} next release, Age of Empires III, much to the delight of reviewers. IGN stated, [...] "After seeing the screenshots, our jaws hit the floor at the amount of detail." [...] 1UP.com described Age of Empires III as [...] "one of the most beautiful games you will put on your computer for the foreseeable future." [...] GameSpy agreed, stating, [...] "Age IIIs graphics are unmatched in the strategy genre." [...] Age of Empires III builds on and introduces new features to the prior release, Age of Mythology, such as the inclusion of the award-winning Havok physics simulation middleware game engine for the Windows version and PhysX for the Mac OS X. The innovative result is that pre-created animations are avoided; instead events are calculated according to the physics engine. Consequently, views of events like building destruction and <b>tree</b> <b>felling</b> are not pre-recorded. GameSpot also admired the graphics in the fourth release but complained about [...] "the awkward unit behavior." [...] Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for pixel shader 3.0.|$|E
500|$|The Normans also {{established}} the royal forests. In Anglo-Saxon times {{there had been}} special woods for hunting called [...] "hays", but the Norman forests were much larger and backed by legal mandate. The new forests were not necessarily heavily wooded but were defined instead by their protection and exploitation by the crown. The Norman forests were subject to special royal jurisdiction; forest law was [...] "harsh and arbitrary, a matter purely for the King's will". Forests were expected to supply the king with hunting grounds, raw materials, goods and money. Revenue from forest rents and fines came to become extremely significant and forest wood was used for castles and royal ship building. Several forests {{played a key role}} in mining, such as the iron mining and working in the Forest of Dean and lead mining in the Forest of High Peak. Several other groups bound up economically with forests; many monasteries had special rights in particular forests, for example for hunting or <b>tree</b> <b>felling.</b> The royal forests were accompanied by the rapid creation of locally owned parks and chases.|$|E

The structure as a whole has also been greatly damaged both deliberately and inadvertently by humans: as Ward writes, it is often the fate of historic structures such as roads to have [...] "been levelled by the plough and plundered of their materials". There are specific mentions of damage to the causeway through ploughing, <b>tree</b> <b>felling,</b> the laying of water mains, attempts to clear vegetation and even, in the twentieth century, by the activity of both tracked [...] and armoured vehicles. The structure has also been heavily and deliberately robbed of stone for use in local construction, such as roads, dry-stone walls, dikes and farm buildings, this robbing continuing from 1586 through to at least the early twentieth century.

500|$|The Nativitys dating {{has long}} been a source of debate among scholars. Estimations range from the mid-1440s to the mid-1450s; [...] early in Christus's career to about the time van der Weyden painted his c. 1455 Altar of St John. Generally the mid-1450s seems the most accepted. Ainsworth {{considers}} it, along with Christus's Holy Family (currently in Kansas City), {{one of the most important}} attributed to him and believes it belongs in his later oeuvre, possibly as late as the mid-1460s. Evidence such as when Christus joined the Confraternity of the Dry Tree (c. early 1460s) points to it as a later work along with the Portrait of a Young Girl. [...] Its use of perspective and assimilation of van Eyck's and van der Weyden's earlier influences also suggest a later date. Furthermore, the softer facial types utilized in the Nativity are typical of Christus's later work, and suggest a date around the mid-1450s. Technical analysis (dendrochronological evidence) suggests a date of c. 1458, based on the <b>tree</b> <b>felling</b> date. [...] Christus painted two other versions of the Nativity: one in Bruges and the other in Berlin. The Bruges Nativity is dated 1452– whether the date was added by Christus or during a restoration is unknown– and technical analysis of the brushstrokes suggests it to be earlier than the Washington Nativity.|$|E
500|$|The name of Felling is {{recorded}} {{as early as}} 1217 and, in 1920, was said {{to refer to a}} clearing where woods and trees were felled. Since there are no other places in Britain which bear this name, despite country-wide <b>tree</b> <b>felling,</b> it is {{much more likely to be}} because it lies on the eastern descent of a Fell, which rises from Team Valley in the west to Low Fell, then still rising to High Fell, before descending down to the Tyne through Felling. Ing is a place name ending which means [...] "the people of". In the 13th century, the Prior of Durham enfeoffed Sir Walter de Selby a manor at Felling [...] "to hold by homage, fealty, knights' service, two marks rent, and suit at the prior's every fortnight". The estate then passed to Walter's son, Adam, whose own son forfeited the estate the manor upon his death, whereupon it was passed to Ralph de Applingden. In 1331, the manor was granted to Sir Thomas Surtees by Bishop Lewis Beaumont, who passed it to his son Alexander and whose own son, Thomas, inherited the estate in 1400 when he was only 20 weeks old. Thomas lived only 35 years, but is notable for having been High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1422. The estate continued to pass through the Surtees family until 1509, when the last surviving member of that family died.|$|E
