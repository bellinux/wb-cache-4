5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> mistake. It all got to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

But it's still called the Australian cricket team.|$|E
500|$|Despite the film's {{repeated}} use of Disney's {{characters and}} iconography, Wu explained, trademark law was not sufficient. [...] "Disney {{does not have}} some kind of general intellectual-property right in Disney World itself." [...] To make a trademark-infringement case against Moore, he continued, Disney would have to convince a court that the use of its protected imagery in the movie could reasonably lead viewers to believe that it had a role in the film's production, and he did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> plausible argument. [...] "The scene where a Disney Princess attempts to crush a child seems to eliminate that possibility." ...|$|E
25|$|The Mistralian orthography of Provençal {{is more or}} less phonemic but not diasystemic and {{is closer}} to the French {{spelling}} and therefore more specific to Provençal; its users are divided between the ones <b>that</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Provençal <b>is</b> <b>a</b> part of Occitan and the ones <b>that</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Provençal <b>is</b> <b>a</b> separate language.|$|R

The executive branch of our government approved 771 different export licenses for sale of dual-use technology to Iraq. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> devastating record.|$|R
500|$|After Troutman's death, Ice Cube {{said that}} [...] "More Bounce To The Ounce" [...] {{introduced}} him to hip-hop. [...] "I was in the sixth grade, we'd stayed after school. We had this dude named Mr. Lock, {{and he used to}} bring in his radio with these pop-lockers. He used to teach [...] the L.A. Lockers, and he would do community service in after-school programs. He knew a lot of kids and introduced them to all the new dances, he put on that song 'More Bounce', and they started pop-locking. And I think from that visual, from seeing that, it was my first introduction into hip-hop. Period. I didn't know nothing about nothing. I hadn't heard [...] "Rapper's Delight" [...] yet. It was the first thing that was really fly to me. They started dancing, and since 'More Bounce' goes on forever, they just got down. I just <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> rush of adrenaline for me, like a chemical reaction in my brain." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Glen Morgan was {{disappointed}} with the resolution regarding the Crew Cut Man, saying [...] "My feeling is that to bring this guy back, his presence should have been better developed, and he's shot off screen. I thought 'Geez, {{this is the guy}} who killed Deep Throat, who the audience loved, and it's kind of tossed away.' The episode just seems like half of one thing for a while, then half of something else. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> curious choice for Chris [...] He wanted to take a real left turn, but I'd rather have seen a whole episode about that guy showing up and Mulder getting back at him." [...] X-Files writer James Wong also had a negative view of the episode, saying [...] "I think {{that was one of the}} most confusing episodes I've ever seen. It had some really neat ideas in it, but I don't think it pulled together finally." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite stating he was [...] "100 percent" [...] healthy {{after the}} groin injury {{suffered}} two games prior, it appeared the injury was still lingering; after throwing a pass {{during the third}} quarter, Cutler fell down and grabbed his groin, before standing back up. [...] Regarding the injuries, Cutler stated, [...] "It held up OK. It's {{all on the same}} leg so I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> problem. But the groin, you take the ankle out of the equation and I would have been fine, I think." [...] Cutler ended the game having completed 21 of 40 passes for 250 yards with a touchdown, interception and a 69.8 passer rating. Despite x-rays on his ankle being negative, Cutler was ruled out of the next week's game against the Baltimore Ravens with a high ankle sprain. During the second quarter, Charles Tillman was also injured, suffering a torn right triceps brachii muscle, and was placed on injured reserve with the designation to return, allowing him to practice after six weeks and play in games two weeks after; as a result, Tillman missed the entire regular season.|$|E

500|$|Meeting the Detroit Red Wings for {{the second}} {{straight}} year in the Finals, Crosby won his first Stanley Cup with the Penguins in seven games. At 21 years, 10 months, and 5 days, Crosby became the youngest NHL captain to win a Stanley Cup championship since 1895. (The youngest captain to lead his team to the Stanley Cup {{in the history of the}} trophy is Mike Grant of the 1895 Montreal Victorias, who was 21 years and 2 months at the time.) In the deciding game seven, Crosby was forced to watch all but 32 seconds of the third period from the bench after suffering a knee injury less than halfway through the second period due to a hit from Johan Franzén. Following the game, Crosby was criticized by Detroit forward Kris Draper for neglecting to shake hands with some of Detroit's players, most notably captain Nicklas Lidström. An irate Draper was quoted as saying [...] "Nick was waiting and waiting, and Crosby didn't come over to shake his hand. That's ridiculous, especially as their captain." [...] Crosby replied afterward, saying, [...] "I just won the Stanley Cup. I think I have the right to celebrate with my teammates. I know it's not easy waiting around...I understand if they don't feel like waiting around. But you know what? It's the easiest thing to do in the world, to shake hands after you win. I had no intentions of trying to skip guys and not shake their hands. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pretty unreasonable comment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Seymour {{later told}} Tracee Hutchison [...] "I {{remember}} having {{a discussion with}} [...] and [...] in a beergarden at the Standard Hotel in Fitzroy, and I said 'Look, you know, we should try and make a commercial record {{if we want to}} take things seriously in the long term.' I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> year before we even started thinking about recording this record". He recalled for 100 Best Australian Albums (October 2010) that all the tracks are [...] "connected to the relationship that [...] and I had".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Alternative Press in September 2010 (in an article praising the album 10 years later) when asked [...] "What's your least favorite thing about the album?" [...] Rodriguez replied: [...] "In a heartbeat I could tell you, one of my only regrets out of everything I've ever done {{is the way that}} record was mixed. People <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> raw and energetic record, but what they're hearing is nothing compared to what it truly was before it was glossed over and sent through the mixing mill that was Andy Wallace, who is a wonderful person and a very talented mixing engineer and has done great albums – I'm not trying to offend him....and I understand he had the pressure of the label and all the people who had dreams of it being this grandiose thing, and being played on the radio, which it was, (but) that record is ruined by the mix. [...] I just find it the most passive, plastic....It's the one record I still to this day cannot listen to." [...] The album was included in Rock Sounds 101 Modern Classics list at number 4. The album was ranked at number 177 on Spins [...] "The 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years (1985–2014)" [...] list.|$|E

The thesis is focused on maternal morbidity, from which I most impressed operative deliveries, particularly repeat cesarean (SC). SC has now become convenient and safe public awareness and way to bring a child into the world. But is it really so? Few people seem to think the risks for the next birth in women with a history of SC. The number of women mainly from the 80 s has risen considerably, so I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> current topic and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{greatest}} friction {{in trade}} and fishery between Japan and New Zealand was the Total Economic Relationship, which was insisted by the PM of NZ.

In spite of the emotional reactions, however, I don’t <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> serious problem. Both sides should know the importance and the character.
