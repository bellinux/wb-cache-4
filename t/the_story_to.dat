5|$|Adams' 1996 sequel, Tales from Watership Down {{includes}} stories {{where the}} female rabbits {{play a more}} prominent role in the Watership Down warren.

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Barnes & Noble called the writing style fluid and Children's Literature praised {{the story for}} being richly detailed. Kirkus Reviews {{compared}} <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> a patchwork of fantasy elements and characters, then concluded that it, despite being derivative, was exciting and held together well.|$|E
5|$|Some modern {{scholars}} do {{not consider}} <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> be describing a historical event but a pious fiction created {{by the author of}} the Gospel of Matthew.|$|E

5|$|Air is {{a romance}} visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of three characters. Much of its {{gameplay}} is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Air follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. With the consumer ports, if an undesired choice was selected, {{there would be an}} option to rewind <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> correct the mistake. However, if the player reaches a bad end to a storyline, the player does not have this option and must reload the game at the last saved point.|$|E
5|$|Although Fleming did not {{date the}} event within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications—have {{identified}} different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole.

5|$|Captain Blackadder's trench {{receives}} {{a phone call}} from HQ: a full-scale attack has been ordered for the next day at dawn. Realising that this is likely to mean his death, Blackadder plans to escape by pretending to be mad: he puts underpants on his head and sticks pencils in his nostrils. His plan is thwarted when General Melchett arrives to see what is happening and remarks that he shot an entire platoon that used this exact method; Blackadder overhears and narrowly escapes Melchett's punishment by pretending he is relating <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> Baldrick.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years after}} the original, Thompson {{returned}} to Nanny McPhee with 2010's Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang. Her screenplay transported <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> Britain during the Second World War, and incorporated a new cast including Maggie Gyllenhaal. Building on the first film's success, it was another UK box office number one and the sequel was widely seen as an improvement. The same year, Thompson reunited with Alan Rickman for the BBC television film The Song of Lunch, which focused on two unnamed characters meeting at a restaurant 15 years after ending their relationship. Thompson's performance earned her a fourth Emmy Award nomination.|$|E
5|$|Ghosh {{admitted}} {{in an interview}} that after his two preceding directorial ventures—Aladin and Home Delivery (2005)—performed poorly at the box office, Kahaani was his last chance to create a niche as a director. He added that the film's plot twist came somewhat accidentally. Having described the skeleton of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> a friend during its development, the friend called him back a few days later to enquire about his film. The friend had mistakenly imagined sequences which he assumed to be parts of the plot, from which the twist ending was derived.|$|E

5|$|Karas, however, {{suffered}} the worst criticisms for its story. Many reviewers {{and even the}} voice actors could not follow its dialogue and presentation. Other reviewers felt the abstract presentation forced viewers who wanted to understand <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> <b>to</b> pay extreme attention to the scant details presented in the show. Reelfilm and DVD Verdict were more critical, stating the viewer {{should not have to}} resort to reading summaries on the packaging to make sense of a story populated with incoherent battles and characters hard to tell apart from.|$|E
5|$|Lamo {{met with}} FBI and Army {{investigators}} on May 25 in California, {{and showed them}} the chat logs.

He met with the FBI again that day, at which point they told him Manning had been arrested in Iraq the day before. Poulsen and Kim Zetter broke {{the news of the}} arrest in Wired on June 6. Wired published around 25 percent of the chat logs on June 6 and 10, and the full logs in July 2011.|$|E

5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{thought that}} The Black Island linked to Hergé's other Adventures in various ways; he {{connected}} the counterfeit money in <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> the counterfeit idol in The Broken Ear and the fake bunker in Tintin in the Land of the Soviets. He also connected Tintin's solving {{of the puzzle}} in the airman's jacket to his solving of the pirate puzzles in The Secret of the Unicorn, and that in transmitting from a place of death, Ben Mor, or mort (death), it linked to Tintin's transmitting from the crypt of Marlinspike Hall in The Secret of the Unicorn.|$|E
5|$|On 24 November 1932, Le Petit Vingtième {{published}} a fictional interview between Jamin and Tintin {{in which the}} reporter {{announced that he would}} be travelling to China via Egypt, India, Ceylon, and Indochina. On 8 December 1932, the story began serialisation in the supplement under the title of The Adventures of Tintin, Reporter, in the Orient. As the story began in Egypt rather than China, Hergé briefly renamed <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> The Cairo Affair. The story was not following any plan or pre-written plot, with Hergé as usual devising the story on a week-by-week basis.|$|E
5|$|On {{a stormy}} night, Percy Bysshe Shelley (Douglas Walton) and Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon) praise Mary Shelley (Elsa Lanchester) for her story of Frankenstein and his Monster.
