30|$|The {{reservoir}} simulation {{attempts to}} meet the specified flow and diversion demands by releasing supplemental water whenever the local flow {{is not sufficient to}} supply the demands. Releases are made when the reservoir storage is greater than the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>inactive</b> <b>storage.</b> No releases are made when the reservoir is below top of inactive pool. Water is stored in flood control zone when it cannot be safely passed through the downstream channel system. When the top of flood pool is exceeded, all excess flood water is released. After flooding recedes, the program will empty the flood volume in storage as quickly as possible. The simulation process determines the reservoir release at each time step and the resulting downstream flows (considering reservoir storage balance equation and linear channel routing e.g. Muskingum routing) while keeping the system in balance.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn the Gulf of Cadiz key {{segment of}} the Africa-Iberia plate {{boundary}} (North-East Atlantic ocean), three main different modes of tectonic interference between a recently identified wrench system (SWIM) and the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge (GCAW) were tested through analog sand-box modeling: a) An active accretionary wedge on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a pre-existent <b>inactive</b> basement fault; b) An active strike-slip fault cutting a previously formed, inactive, accretionary wedge; and c) Simultaneous activity of both the accretionary wedge and the strike-slip fault. The results we obtained and the comparison with the natural deformation pattern favor a tectonic evolution comprising two main steps: i) {{the formation of the}} Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Wedge on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>inactive,</b> Tethyan-related, basement faults (Middle Miocene to ~ 1. 8 Ma); ii) subsequent reactivation of these basement faults with dextral strike-slip motion (~ 1. 8 Ma to present) simultaneously with continued tectonic accretion in the GCAW. These results exclude the possibility of ongoing active SWIM wrench system cross-cutting an inactive GCAW structure. Our results also support a new interpretation of the SWIM wrench system as fundamentally resulting from strike-slip reactivation of an old (Tethyan-related) plate boundary...|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} work, {{we found that}} Sdo 1 p could induce the {{formation}} of 60 S- 60 S dimers in vitro through crosslinking H 69 and H 38 from the two participating 60 S subunits. In bacterial and mammalian cells, it was shown that higher-order organization of ribosomes is employed by the cells {{as a means to}} regulate the translation capacity by limiting the number of active ribosomes. In E. coli, upon transition to stationary phase, cells start to accumulate 100 S particles (Yoshida and Wada, 2014), composed of 70 S dimers induced by protein factors called ribosome modulation factor (RMF) (Wada et al., 1995) and hibernation promoting factor (HPF) (Ueta et al., 2005). When mammalian (rat) cells were challenged by amino acid starvation, a form of 110 S particles, including 80 S dimers and 80 S- 60 S heterodimers, were also detected (Krokowski et al., 2011). These previous data indicate a conserved mechanism of translation modulation by organizing ribosomes into resting higher-order assemblies. Previous work also suggested SBDS has a second role in multiple cellular stress response pathways, independent of its primary role in ribosome biogenesis (Ball et al., 2009). HEK 293 cells with the deletion of SBDS are hypersensitive to DNA damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Ball et al., 2009). HeLa cells with SBDS-knockdown, as well as SDS patient cells are hypersensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis (Watanabe et al., 2009; Watanabe and Dror, 2005). In yeast, Sdo 1 p physically interacts with Btn 1 p (CLN 3 in human) and was suggested to involved in cellular responses to pH and nutrient changes (Vitiello et al., 2010). Therefore, {{it is possible that the}} 60 S dimers induced by Sdo 1 p, if not an in vitro artifact, might represent a form <b>of</b> <b>inactive</b> <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> ribosomal subunits upon a certain stress (Fig.  6 G). This attractive hypothesis merits further investigation.|$|R

Application of three zinc rates in soil (250, 500, 750 mg. kg- 1) {{resulted in a}} progressive (1. 7 - to 3. 3 -times) increase of endogenous CKs in spinach leaves. This increase was predominantly due to accumulation <b>of</b> <b>inactive</b> and <b>storage</b> CK forms (N- and O-glucosides) and was accompanied with an enhanced activity of cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX), the key CK degradative enzyme, especially on the highest zinc rate (750 mg. kg- 1 soil). On this rate, maximum endogenous CK concentrations in both control and stressed plants were found at {{the first and the}} last samplings, i. e. in the course of very young leaf development and just before or during flowering.

30|$|The {{function}} <b>of</b> the <b>inactive</b> RNase {{induced by}} Zn deficiency is not clear. An inactive S-like RNase accumulate in the rhizomes of Calystegia sepium and is suggested {{to play a}} role in vegetative storage proteins (Van Damme et al. [2000]). Thus, Zn-deficient rice might accumulate <b>inactive</b> RNase for <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> amino acids. The inactive RNase, also, accumulate in response to drought stress (Salekdeh et al. [2002]), one of the most fatal stresses for plants. Therefore, the induction <b>of</b> the <b>inactive</b> RNase could be due to fatal stress for plants caused subsequently by Zn-deficiency stress. However, in our experiment, Fe-deficient stress decreased the expression of AK 061438 and AK 109411 (Figure 4), although Fe-deficient stress is more detrimental to plant growth than other micronutrient-deficient stresses. Moreover, the expression of AK 061438 decreased under sulfur-deficient stress (Ohkama-Ohtsu et al. [2004]). These data suggest that the induction <b>of</b> putative <b>inactive</b> RNases is specifically caused by Zn-or water-deficient stress rather than by general stress conditions in plants.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{mechanism}} <b>of</b> activation <b>of</b> <b>inactive</b> renin was {{studied in}} normal human plasma. The molecular weight of active renin and those <b>of</b> <b>inactive</b> renin {{before and after}} activation were analyzed by sephadex gel filtration. Active renin of human plasma had a molecular weight of 48, 000 ± 1000. Trypsin treat-ment and cold treatment activated <b>inactive</b> renin <b>of</b> a molecular weight of 54, 000 ± 1000. The inactive renin apparently did not change its molecular weight after activation. "Cryoactivation " <b>of</b> <b>inactive</b> renin was possi-ble only when whole plasma was used. When the whole plasma was fractionated by gel filtration, cryoactiva-tion was not observed {{in any of the}} fractions. Cryoactivation requires certain plasma factors) contained in some fractions.
