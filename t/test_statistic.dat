It is now well-known that testing of cointegration ranks based on Johansen*s (1995) ML-based method suffers from severe small sample size distortions. Furthermore, the distributions of empirical economic and financial time series tend to display fat tails, heteroskedasticity and skewness that are inconsistent with the usual distributional assumptions of likelihood-based approach.

Several different system models are analyzed including random signature sequences with ideal channels, deterministic signature sequences with ideal channels, random signature sequences with slowly fading channels, and deterministic signature sequences with slowly fading channels. We assume that the chips received from each of the multiple-access interference (MAI) sources are synchronous with the chips from a reference source. This provides an upper bound for an asynchronous DS/CDMA system.

25|$|Thus {{computing}} a p-value {{requires a}} null hypothesis, a <b>test</b> <b>statistic</b> (together with deciding whether the researcher is performing a one-tailed test or a two-tailed test), and data. Even though computing the <b>test</b> <b>statistic</b> on given data may be easy, computing the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis, and then computing its {{cumulative distribution function}} (CDF) is often a difficult problem. Today, this computation is done using statistical software, often via numeric methods (rather than exact formulae), {{but in the early}} and mid 20th century, this was instead done via tables of values, and one interpolated or extrapolated p-values from these discrete values. Rather than using a table of p-values, Fisher instead inverted the CDF, publishing a list of values of the <b>test</b> <b>statistic</b> for given fixed p-values; this corresponds to computing the quantile function (inverse CDF).|$|E

We test {{the null hypothesis}} whether p_j=q_π(j) for some label permutation π. The uncertainty of label permutation implies that the null hypothesis is composite instead of being singular. In this paper, we construct a testing procedure using statistics that are defined as indefinite integrals of some symmetric polynomials. This method is aimed directly at the invariant signal of the problem, and avoids the need of matching the unknown labels. The asymptotic distribution of the <b>testing</b> <b>statistic</b> is shown to be chi-squared, and its power is proved to be nearly optimal under a local alternative hypothesis.
