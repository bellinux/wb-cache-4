It allows expanding the research opportunities, as well as simplifying and reducing the actual testing, because it permits the wide variation of values and parameters reality {{of the elements of}} electric power circuits in the traction system without considerable material costs. Purpose: For this purpose the mathematical model of the nonlinear dynamical system "traction substation – electric traction network – electric rolling stock» as a passive <b>two-terminal</b> <b>network</b> with the given input voltage and input current is proposed.

A set of operations on graphs which increase the number of their spanning trees is given.

40|$|Open AccessThe {{elementary}} <b>two-terminal</b> <b>network</b> {{consisting of}} a resistively (R) shunted inductance (L) in series with a capacitatively (C) shunted resistance (R) with R= L/C, {{is known for its}} non-dispersive dissipative response, i. e. with the input impedance Z 0 (w) = R, independent of the frequency (w). In this communication, we examine the properties of a novel equivalent network derived iteratively from this <b>two-terminal</b> <b>network</b> by replacing everywhere the elemental resistive part R with the whole <b>two-terminal</b> <b>network.</b> This replacement suggests a recursion Zn+ 1 (w) = f(Zn(w)), with the recursive function f (z) = (iw Lz/iw L + z) + (z/ 1 + iw Cz). This recursive map has two fixed points – an unstable fixed point Z*u = 0, and a stable fixed point Z*s = R. Thus, resistances at the boundary terminating the infinitely iterated network can now be made arbitrarily small without changing the input impedance Z¥ (= R). This, therefore, leads to realizing in the limit n ® ¥, an effectively dissipative network comprising essentially the non-dissipative reactive elements (L and C) only. Hence the oxymoron–resistance without resistance! This is best viewed as a classical anomaly akin to the one encountered in turbulence.

40|$|Abstract. An open {{problem is}} {{presented}} regarding {{the existence of}} pure strategy Nash equilibrium (PNE) in network congestion games with {{a finite number of}} non-identical players, in which the strategy set of each player is the collection of all paths in a given network that link the player’s origin and destination vertices, and congestion increases the costs of edges. A network congestion game in which the players differ only in their origin–destination pairs is a potential game, which implies that, regardless of the exact functional form of the cost functions, it has a PNE. A PNE does not necessarily exist if (i) the dependence of the cost of each edge on the number of users is player- as well as edgespecific or (ii) the (possibly, edge-specific) cost is the same for all players but it is a function (not of the number but) of the total weight of the players using the edge, with each player i having a different weight wi. In a parallel <b>two-terminal</b> <b>network,</b> in which the origin and the destination are the only vertices different edges have in common, a PNE always exists even if the players differ in either their cost functions or weights, but not in both.

40|$|Abstract- Application of a {{switched}} <b>two-terminal</b> RC <b>networks</b> for {{the construction}} of phase-sensitive detectors (PSDs) which are used in self-balancing transformer bridges is described. The switched <b>two-terminal</b> RC <b>network</b> makes possible effective reduction of noise level, increasing the CMRR, removing the input DC offset and providing the galvanic separation of the input and output circuits. Investigation of properties of the precise phase-sensitive detector used in a prototype self-balancing bridge for maintenance of inductance standard shows that the noise attenuation is bigger than 100 dB. Nowadays, the precise phase-sensitive detector described in the paper successfully operates in the automatic impedance bridge KWL 1 designed for high accurate inductance measurement at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Braunschweig (PTB, Germany) [4]. circuit. A phase-sensitive detector, in turn, needs preamplification for unbalance signal level over ten milivolts. For lower signals accuracy of these detectors decrease rapidly. It is significant that noise and interference are amplified during the signal amplification.

40|$|Abstract. Different {{kinds of}} networks, such as transportation, communication, computer, and supply networks, are {{susceptible}} to similar kinds of inefficiencies. These arise when congestion externalities make the cost for each user depend on the other users ’ choice of routes. If each user chooses the least expensive (e. g., the fastest) route from the users ’ common point of origin to the common destination, the result may be Pareto inefficient in that an alternative choice of routes would reduce the costs for all users. Braess’s paradox represents an extreme kind of inefficiency, in which the equilibrium costs may be reduced by raising the cost curves. As this paper shows, this paradox occurs in an (undirected) <b>two-terminal</b> <b>network</b> {{if and only if}} it is not series-parallel.
