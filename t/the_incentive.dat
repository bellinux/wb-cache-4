After the threshold of 50 000 electric vehicles was reached in April 2015, there has been an ongoing debate regarding whether <b>the</b> <b>incentives</b> {{for electric}} vehicles should be withheld. The intent of <b>the</b> <b>incentives</b> is to develop a more climate friendly vehicle fleet. Although <b>the</b> <b>incentives</b> impact on joint purchase is important to understand how efficient <b>the</b> <b>incentives</b> are in achieving the policy objective, we are not aware of any research on this area up to this point. Our contribution is a theoretical model that allow consumers to purchase multiple differentiated product varieties, a behavior defined as multi-homing. The model predicts that multi-homing softens the competition between electric and conventional vehicles and partially absorbs the demand shifting effect of <b>the</b> <b>incentives.</b> Furthermore, we conduct empirical research on the car market to analyse how the car market historically has reacted to <b>the</b> <b>incentives.</b> Our findings coincide with the model's predictions at a satisfactory level. We find that all <b>incentives</b> increase <b>the</b> number of multi-homers. While our estimations shows that free ferry admission leads to an increased vehicle fleet, the introduction of toll stations, congestion charge and road toll lead to a reduction in the overall vehicle stock. The empirical results reveal that <b>the</b> <b>incentives</b> only seem to phase out sales of conventional cars if they are derivatives of policy instruments with a negative effect on the demand for conventional vehicles...|$|R

He would prefer to invest in a developed country, where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.|$|E
5|$|Two {{other factors}} {{have often been}} cited in Stroma's depopulation: the {{building}} of the nuclear power station at nearby Dounreay in the 1950s, which created many new jobs on the mainland, and in the same decade the construction of a harbour on Stroma on which many islanders were employed. Although it has been claimed that this gave the islanders <b>the</b> <b>incentive</b> (and the means) to leave, local historian Donald A. Young points out that of islanders who left after 1945, only one went directly from Stroma to Dounreay. Most of the rest either continued fishing or carried on crofting on the mainland, while others found alternative jobs. Some ex-islanders eventually found jobs at Dounreay, but they had already moved to the mainland for work or education.|$|E

5|$|Although the Offaly revolt was {{followed}} by a determination to rule Ireland more closely, Henry was wary of drawn-out conflict with the tribes, and a royal commission recommended that the only relationship with the tribes was to be promises of peace, their land protected from English expansion. The man to lead this effort was Sir Antony St Leger, as Lord Deputy of Ireland, who would remain into the post past Henry's death. Until the break with Rome, it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere fiefdom to the English king, so in 1541 Henry asserted England's claim to the Kingdom of Ireland free from the Papal overlordship. This change did, however, also allow a policy of peaceful reconciliation and expansion: the Lords of Ireland would grant their lands to the King, before being returned as fiefdoms. <b>The</b> <b>incentive</b> to comply with Henry's request was an accompanying barony, and thus a right to sit in the Irish House of Lords, which was to run in parallel with England's. The Irish law of the tribes did not suit such an arrangement, because the chieftain did not have the required rights; this made progress tortuous, and the plan was abandoned in 1543, not to be replaced.|$|E

Serbian authorities thought the international community had no moral grounds to judge because they did not interfere when hundreds of thousands of Serbs were killed in Croatian concentration camps during World War II.

Because the siege shaped the international opinion of the Croatian War of Independence, it became a major contributor to a shift in the international diplomatic and economic isolation of Serbia and rump Yugoslavia, which came to be viewed as an aggressor-state in the West.
