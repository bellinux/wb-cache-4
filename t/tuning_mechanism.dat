25|$|Blowing more softly {{lowers the}} pitch; blowing harder raises it. Breath force {{can change the}} pitch by three semitones. This is why ocarinas {{generally}} have no <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> or dynamic range, and why {{it is hard to}} learn to play one in tune.|$|E

40|$|We used a noise-masking {{paradigm}} {{to investigate}} the number and properties of chromatic mechanisms involved in image segmentation. Observers were presented with a pattern of dynamic random squares, each independently modulated along a certain direction in DKL color space, either in the isoluminant plane or in the L j M luminance plane. A signal consisting of a rectangular region of squares, oriented horizontally or vertically, {{was added to the}} noise. The signal squares were spatially and temporally aligned to the noise squares, excluding the possibility of phase offsets to mediate segmentation performance. Noise and signal color directions were independently varied, and the signal contrast was measured at which an observer could reliably indicate the orientation of the signal. In a second set of experiments, the noise was simultaneously varying in two directions, symmetrically arranged around the signal direction. Masking was generally highest when signal and noise were modulated along the same direction and minimal for orthogonal noise. No difference was found between signals modulated along cardinal directions or intermediate directions. However, measured tuning widths critically depended on the type of noise: Noise modulated along one direction results in narrow tuning, whereas two-sided noise results in broad tuning. A chromatic detection model with multiple broadly <b>tuned</b> <b>mechanisms</b> successfully accounts for the experimental findings, both for narrow and broad tuning curves. Models with four broadly <b>tuned</b> cardinal <b>mechanisms</b> or multiple narrowly <b>tuned</b> <b>mechanisms</b> failed to reproduce the data. Our results suggest an important role for multiple, broadly <b>tuned</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in image segmentation...|$|R
25|$|Changing {{the pitch}} of a timpani by turning each tension rod {{individually}} is a laborious process. In the late 19th century, mechanical systems to change the tension of the entire head at once were developed. Any timpani equipped with such a system may be considered machine timpani, although this term commonly refers to drums that use a handle connected to a spider-type <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Given their vertical-cavity geometry, VCSOAs are {{resonant}} cavity optical amplifiers that operate with the input/output signal entering/exiting normal to the wafer surface. In {{addition to their}} small size, the surface normal operation of VCSOAs leads {{to a number of}} advantages, including low power consumption, low noise figure, polarization insensitive gain, and the ability to fabricate high fill factor two-dimensional arrays on a single semiconductor chip. These devices are still {{in the early stages of}} research, though promising preamplifier results have been demonstrated. Further extensions to VCSOA technology are the demonstration of wavelength tunable devices. These MEMS-tunable vertical-cavity SOAs utilize a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> for wide and continuous tuning of the peak gain wavelength of the amplifier. SOAs have a more rapid gain response, which is in the order of 1 to 100 ps.|$|E
2500|$|When used together, the SB-300 {{receiver}} and SB-400 transmitter could transceive and had many other {{features of the}} S/Line, including crystal bandwidth filters and 1kHz tuning dial resolution. They could also operate separately (if the optional crystal pack was installed in the transmitter), giving the operator more flexibility in talking to foreign stations who could not transmit in the same range as the U.S. stations could.

40|$|Networks of {{signaling}} pathways perform complex temporal decoding {{functions in}} diverse biological systems, including the synapse, development, and bacterial chemotaxis. This paper examines temporal filtering and tuning properties of synaptic signaling pathways {{as a possible}} substrate for emergent temporal decoding. A mass action kinetic model of 16 synaptic signaling pathways was used to dissect out the contribution of these pathways in linear cascades and when coupled to form a network. The model predicts two primary <b>mechanisms</b> of temporal <b>tuning</b> of pathways: a weighted summation of responses of pathways with different timings {{and the presence of}} biochemical feedback loop(s) with emergent dynamics. Regulatory inputs act differently on these two <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> In the first case, regulators act like a gain-control on pathways with different intrinsic tuning. In the case of feedback loops, the temporal properties of the loop itself are changed. These basic <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms</b> may underlie specialized temporal tuning functions in more complex signaling systems in biology...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{flame and}} flow {{structure}} of a swirl-stabilized pilot combustor in conventional, high temperature, and flameless modes {{by means of a}} partially stirred reactor combustion model to provide a better insight into designing lean premixed combustion devices with preheating system. Finite rate chemistry combustion model with one step <b>tuned</b> <b>mechanism</b> and large eddy simulation is used to numerically simulate six cases in these modes. Results show that moving towards high temperature mode by increasing the preheating level, the combustor is prone to formation of thermal NOx with higher risks of flashback. In addition, the flame becomes shorter and thinner with higher turbulent kinetic energies. On the other hand, towards the flameless mode, leaning the preheated mixture leads to almost thermal NOx -free combustion with lower risk of flashback and thicker and longer flames. Simulations also show qualitative agreements with available experiments, indicating that the current combustion model with one step <b>tuned</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is capable of capturing main features of the turbulent flame {{in a wide range of}} mixture temperature and equivalence ratios.

50|$|Professional bassists {{are more}} likely to have {{adjustable}} bridges, which have a metal screw mechanism. This enables the bassist to raise or lower the height of the strings to accommodate changing humidity or temperature conditions. The metal tuning machines are attached to the sides of the pegbox with metal screws. While <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanisms</b> generally differ from the higher-pitched orchestral stringed instruments, some basses have non-functional, ornamental tuning pegs projecting from the side of the pegbox, in imitation of the tuning pegs on a cello or violin.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{determined}} two-dimensional motion discrimination contours in the spatio-temporal {{frequency plane}} {{to characterize the}} mechanisms underlying velocity perception. In particular, we wanted {{to determine whether there}} exist <b>mechanisms</b> <b>tuned</b> specifically to velocity, rather than separable <b>mechanisms</b> <b>tuned</b> to spatial and temporal frequency. A 4 -AFC paradigm was used to determine spatio-temporal frequency discrimination thresholds for moving sinewave gratings defined by luminance contrast. Three of the grating patches used were defined by the same spatial and temporal frequency (standard), the other (test) differed by a fixed proportional change in spatial and temporal frequency. Subjects had to indicate which grating differed most from the others and the thresholds determined for varying proportions of change in spatial and temporal frequency were used to trace out complete threshold contours in the plane spanned by these attributes. Some of the contours, primarily at speeds above 1 deg/s, were noticeably oriented along lines of constant velocity. To further isolate these mechanisms, spatio-temporal noise was added to the standard stimuli either along a line of constant velocity or in the direction orthogonal to it. When spatio-temporal noise of constant velocity was added to the standard stimuli, threshold contours became elongated only along the direction of the noise. The same amount of noise in the orthogonal direction produced an overall increase in thresholds without changing the shape of the contour, presenting clear evidence for velocity <b>tuned</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> In further experiments we discovered that velocity <b>tuned</b> <b>mechanisms</b> interact with separable mechanisms to produce optimal discriminability. Analogous experiments with isoluminant stimuli failed to exhibit evidence for velocity tuning, supporting the notion that the human color vision system is impaired in its coding of stimulus speed, despite excellent sensitivity to direction of motion...|$|R

30|$|The {{majority}} of plants {{can be classified}} as non-accumulator plants. Nevertheless, all {{have to cope with}} heavy metals for nutrition purposes and growing in metalliferous soils, respectively. Hence, they have to possess finely <b>tuned</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for living with even toxic heavy metals (Hall 2002 Clemens 20012006). The simplest strategy is to avoid metal uptake from soil or to exclude it preventing metal movement into shoots. Additionally, elements for the acquisition and sequestration of essential metals are often used. However, this can cause interferences with the plant metal homeostasis and probably induce toxic symptoms.|$|R

50|$|The end of {{the string}} that mounts to the {{instrument}}'s <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism</b> (the part of the instrument which can be turned to tighten or loosen the tension of the string) is usually plain. Depending on the instrument, the string's other, fixed end may have either a plain, loop, or ball end (a short brass cylinder) that attaches the string at the end opposite the <b>tuning</b> <b>mechanism.</b> When a ball or loop is used with a guitar, this ensures that the string stays fixed in {{the bridge of the}} guitar. When a ball or loop is used with a violin-family instrument, this keeps the string end fixed in the tailpiece. Fender Bullet strings have a larger cylinder for more stable tuning on guitars equipped with synchronized tremolo systems. Strings for some instruments may be wrapped with silk at the ends to protect the string. The color and pattern of the silk often identifies attributes of the string, such as manufacturer, size, intended pitch, etc.|$|E
