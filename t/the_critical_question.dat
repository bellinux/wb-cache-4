500|$|An {{article in}} the Maryland Law Review {{authored}} by Christopher Gozdor (a lawyer in the Maryland Attorney General's office) was also critical of the decision, although he was concerned instead with an alleged lack of clarity in the majority opinion. It discussed the case law relating to government speech and examined what it described as the [...] "conditions doctrine", where certain conditions on receiving federal funds were upheld or struck down. The article {{then turned to the}} Rust distinction. Gozdor explained: [...] "The Court distinguished Velazquez from Rust because Rust involved a subsidy to facilitate private expression of the government's message, while Velazquez involved LSC funding that was designed [...] private speech." [...] <b>The</b> <b>critical</b> <b>question</b> for the court was the characterization of the speech that the law promoted. Because advocacy by LSC grantees to change welfare laws was not in advance of the government's own message, the restriction placed on it essentially prohibited a form of private speech. The relationship, Gozdor asserted, that the Court set forth was that the restriction [...] "distorted" [...] private speech. This [...] "distortion principle" [...] was the main criticism of the article (as was Scalia's dissent). Gozdor, agreeing with Scalia's dissent, wrote that the restriction did not create such a distortion of private speech because Congress had still permitted LSC to form affiliate organizations which would be considered [...] "legally separate". Notwithstanding the difficulty of an organization to classify itself as an [...] "affiliate entity" [...] of LSC, Gozdor argued that there was no real prevention of speech when there were ample alternative means of relaying the message.|$|E

2500|$|If the Hague Conventions is {{admitted}} as applicable, <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> <b>question</b> becomes whether the bombed cities met {{the definition of}} [...] "undefended". Some observers consider Hiroshima and Nagasaki undefended, some say that both cities were legitimate military targets, and others say that Hiroshima {{could be considered a}} legitimate military target while Nagasaki was comparatively undefended. Hiroshima has been argued as not a legitimate target because the major industrial plants were just outside the target area. It has also been argued as a legitimate target because Hiroshima was the headquarters of the regional Second General Army and Fifth Division with 40,000 combatants stationed in the city. Both cities were protected by anti-aircraft guns, which is an argument against the definition of [...] "undefended".|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>critical</b> <b>question</b> was: whom did the {{football}} touch in the Fuqua/Tatum collision? If it bounced off Fuqua without ever touching Tatum, then Harris's reception was illegal. If the ball bounced off only Tatum, {{or if it}} bounced off both Fuqua and Tatum (in any order), then the reception was legal. The rule stated in the pertinent part that once an offensive player touches a pass, {{he is the only}} offensive player eligible to catch the pass. However, if a defensive player touches the pass [...] "first, or simultaneously with or subsequent to its having been touched by only one offensive player, then all offensive players become and remain eligible" [...] to catch the pass. (This rule was later rescinded in 1978.) If the reception were illegal, the Raiders would have gained possession (by a turnover on downs), clinching a victory.|$|E

2500|$|Behaviorists explain {{personality}} {{in terms of}} the effects external stimuli have on behavior. [...] The approaches used to analyze the behavioral aspect of personality are known as behavioral theories or learning-conditioning theories. These approaches were a radical shift away from Freudian philosophy. One of the major tenets of this concentration of personality psychology is a strong emphasis on scientific thinking and experimentation. [...] This school of thought was developed by B. F. Skinner who put forth a model which emphasized the mutual interaction of the person or [...] "the organism" [...] with its environment. [...] Skinner believed children do bad things because the behavior obtains attention that serves as a reinforcer. For example: a child cries because the child's crying in the past has led to attention. [...] These are the response, and consequences. [...] The response is the child crying, and the attention that child gets is the reinforcing consequence. According to this theory, people's behavior is formed by processes such as operant conditioning. [...] Skinner put forward a [...] "three term contingency model" [...] which helped promote analysis of behavior based on the [...] "Stimulus - Response - Consequence Model" [...] in which <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> <b>question</b> is: [...] "Under which circumstances or antecedent 'stimuli' does the organism engage in a particular behavior or 'response', which in turn produces a particular 'consequence'?" ...|$|E

The band of silver paleness along the east horizon made even the distant parts of the Great Plain appear dark and near; and the whole enormous landscape bore that impress of reserve, taciturnity, and hesitation which is usual just before day. The eastward pillars and their architraves stood up blackly against the light, and the great flame-shaped Sun-stone beyond them; and the Stone of Sacrifice midway. Presently the night wind died out, and the quivering little pools in the cup-like hollows of the stones lay still. At the same time something seemed to move on the verge of the dip eastward--a mere dot. It was the head of a man approaching them from the hollow beyond the Sun-stone. Clare wished they had gone onward, but in the circumstances decided to remain quiet. The figure came straight towards the circle of pillars in which they were.|$|E

60|$|When all {{has been}} said of a man's gifts, <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> <b>question</b> still stands over, how he regards his {{responsibility}} for using them. Once {{in a conversation with}} Mr. Gladstone, some fifty years from the epoch of this present chapter, we fell upon the topic of ambition. 'Well,' he said, 'I do not think that I can tax myself in my own life with ever having been much moved by ambition.' The remark so astonished me that, as he afterwards playfully reported to a friend, I almost jumped up from my chair. We soon shall reach a stage in his career when both remark and surprise may explain themselves. We shall see that if ambition means love of power or fame for the sake of glitter, decoration, external renown, or even dominion and authority on their own account--and all these are common passions enough in strong natures as well as weak--then his view of himself was just. I think he had none of it. Ambition in a better sense, the motion of a resolute and potent genius to use strength for the purposes of strength, to clear the path, dash obstacles aside, force good causes forward--such a quality as that is the very law of the being of a personality so vigorous, intrepid, confident, and capable as his.|$|E
