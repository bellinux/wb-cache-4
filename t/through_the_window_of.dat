5|$|Home met one of {{his future}} closest friends in 1867; the young Lord Adare (later the 4th Earl of Dunraven). Adare was fascinated by Home, and began documenting the séances they held. The {{following}} year, Home {{was said to have}} levitated out of the third storey window of one room, and back in <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> the adjoining room in front of three witnesses (Adare, Captain Wynne, and Lord Lindsay).|$|E
5|$|In the {{drafts of}} the Alien Resurrection screenplay, writer Joss Whedon {{included}} a death {{scene in which}} a lifeform was sucked through {{a gap in the}} hull of a ship. In the second draft, Perez was sucked through a fist-sized breach in the hull of the Auriga; this was changed in the final version to the Newborn being sucked <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> the Betty. 20th Century Fox executives were skeptical about the final version, seeing it as a comedic scene contrasting with the overall tone of the Alien franchise, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet persuaded them to leave the scene in.|$|E
5|$|Lépine {{continued}} into the second-floor corridor and wounded three students before entering another room where he twice attempted to shoot a female student. His weapon failed to fire so he entered the emergency staircase where he was seen reloading his gun. He returned to the room he had just left, but the students had locked the door; Lépine failed to unlock it with three shots fired into the door. Moving along the corridor he shot at others, wounding one, before moving towards the financial services office where he shot and killed a woman <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> the door she had just locked.|$|E

5|$|When Monk {{returns with}} Natalie (Traylor Howard) to Dr. Kroger's office, they meet Francis Merrigan (Gordon Clapp), who owns an {{importing}} and exporting business {{based in the}} same building. Merrigan is carrying a milk carton, which {{he says he is}} utilizing for a coffeemaker. That night, someone throws a rock <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> Dr. Kroger's house. Stottlemeyer and Disher keep the suspicion on one of Dr. Kroger's patients. As they interview the Kroger family, they learn Kroger suspects his rebellious son Troy (Cody McMains) did it. Monk, however, believes that whoever killed Teresa might have thrown the rock to make everyone believe that one of Dr. Kroger's patients is involved. Monk recognizes the rock, though he does not know where he saw it.|$|E
5|$|When questioned, the Woodsman (whose name is Kirk) {{reveals that}} he is in fact an {{aspiring}} actor who was only trying out for the part of a woodsman in a commercial. After his schnitzel truck was robbed by the Goody Bandit, he went out into the woods to get in character for his role and {{spent the rest of the}} day chopping trees. A large tree rolled after him and pushed him <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> Granny's home. The investigation then turns to Granny, who reveals that, unbeknownst to her family, she is an extreme sports enthusiast. During a ski race earlier that day, she was attacked by the opposing team, but got away safely after learning that they were hired by the Goody Bandit.|$|E
5|$|Babe {{returns to}} the Vic, but is {{rejected}} by Mick's wife Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) and leaves. When Stan loses {{the use of his}} legs due to his prostate cancer, Tina asks Babe to visit so she can persuade him to seek medical help. Stan is pleased to see Babe and reconciles with Tina. Although Babe is upset when Stan proposes to Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), she encourages Cora to accept the proposal as Stan will never love her. After Stan's death, Babe excludes Cora from his funeral and encourages the rift between Mick and Shirley. After the funeral, Babe tells Sylvie, who is residing in a care home, that Stan has died, which frustrates Sylvie as she could not attend the funeral. Babe and Sylvie argue and exchange insults, leading to Babe slapping Sylvie. Sylvie then bites Babe's shoulder and threatens to report a criminal act that Babe and Queenie Trott (Judy Cornwell) committed several years earlier. Babe continues to create a rift between the Carter family and pays a teenager to throw a brick <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> Shirley's son Dean Wicks's (Matt Di Angelo) salon. However, Dean's father, Buster Briggs (Karl Howman), learns the truth behind the attack and confronts Babe in front of the Carters, tipping a trifle over her head. After realising Babe's deceit, Mick and Shirley force Babe to leave Walford, but Babe warns that she will return.|$|E

25|$|Pintarić was {{suspicious}} towards his wife, believing {{that she was}} helping the police to capture or even kill him. On 24 October 1973 Pintarić shot her dead <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> his brother's house and fled into the night. Again, Pintarić was drunk when he committed the crime, and had no recollection of the event on the following day.

25|$|Freddy attacks Nancy once again. Realizing he {{is powered}} by his victim's fear, she calmly turns her back on him, {{reducing}} him to nothingness. She steps outside into a bright morning where all of her friends and mother are still alive. She gets into Glen's car {{to go to school}} when the top comes down and suddenly locks them in. As the car is driven uncontrollably down the street, Marge is grabbed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> their front door by Freddy's gloved hand and is dragged through it to her apparent death.|$|E
25|$|The Kinetoscope was {{an early}} motion picture {{exhibition}} device. It was designed for films to be viewed individually <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> a cabinet housing its components. The Kinetoscope introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection {{before the advent of}} video, creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. First described in conceptual terms by Thomas Alva Edison in 1888, his invention was largely developed by one of his assistants, William Kennedy Laurie Dickson, between 1889 and 1892.|$|E
25|$|In January 1669, Morgan brought ten {{ships and}} 800 men to Isla Vaca as a {{rendezvous}} point before launching {{a raid on}} the Spanish city of Cartagena. Because {{he and his fellow}} buccaneers had just captured two French warships, they decided to celebrate in the easily accessible Ferret Bay on the northwest side of the island. They made a fire to roast several pigs and fired the cannons of their flagship as was typical for a buccaneer celebration. In the midst of their drunken revelry, the ship's gunpowder magazine was accidentally lit, triggering an explosion that blew up Morgan's flagship Oxford. In the explosion, Morgan, who was on board the ship, was thrown <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> his quarters and into the sea. He survived the accident, but the Oxford sank, taking down with it the two captured French warships (which were tied to it) and about 200 of his men.|$|E
50|$|Mr. and Mrs. Bates {{were not}} only fired but Blacklisted from all public school {{teaching}} positions {{in the state of}} Mississippi. Gunshots were fired <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bates’ home and it was ultimately burned to the ground in 1949.|$|R

60|$|Arrived at the Babe's residence, they {{rang the}} bell, and, in the {{interval}} {{of waiting for}} the door to be opened, listened with envy to certain sounds of revelry which filtered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> a room {{to the right of the}} porch.|$|R
25|$|Mick {{successfully}} completes his swim for charity, {{but on his}} way home, he sees Ian {{talking to}} Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks) <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> Ian's car. Mick pulls up behind them but Ian drives away, so Rainie, a prostitute, propositions Mick. He {{says he is not}} interested, and then the police arrive. Rainie claims Mick is a regular punter, so he is arrested for soliciting. Later, Ian explains that he had sex with Rainie on the night his daughter Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) was murdered, so Mick agrees not to tell anyone, though he is forced to tell Linda when she receives a call from his solicitor. Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) overhears this and supports Linda at the court. Mick pleads guilty, and Cora discovers that the prostitute is her daughter. She reveals Mick's alleged crime to everyone in The Vic. Linda hates that Mick has put Ian before his own family, so Mick resolves to make Ian tell the truth to his partner Denise Fox (Diane Parish).|$|E
25|$|He {{responded to}} these criticisms by attacking his detractors {{in the pages}} of Murray's Magazine, {{supporting}} vigilante activity, which the police on the streets knew was a bad idea, and publicly complaining about his lack of control of CID, which brought an official Home Office reprimand for discussing his office publicly without permission. Warren finally had enough and resigned – coincidentally right before the murder of Mary Jane Kelly on 9 November 1888. Every superintendent on the force visited him at home to express their regret. Warren's resignation hindered the investigation. He had given an order that if another murder occurred, nobody was to enter the scene – a strange turn of phrase as the four previous victims had all been found in the open street – until he arrived to direct the investigation. Consequently, when the murder of Kelly was discovered by a rent collector who looked in <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> her room in a Spitalfields lodging house, the police did not enter the room for some three hours because, unaware of his resignation, they were waiting for Warren to arrive. He returned to military duties.|$|E
500|$|It was {{measured}} at over [...] and had cleared the [...] wall in center field, crashing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> an auto dealer {{across the street}} from the stadium. Locals claimed it was the longest home run ever hit in St. Louis. Meusel then hit a single in right field, but was tagged out as he tried to head for second base. Gehrig followed with a double to the opposite side, but could not score when Lazzeri popped up to Thevenow to end the inning.|$|E

50|$|On March 31, Díaz had an {{accident}} that almost cost him his life. The roof of a house collapsed and buried half of his body; when the Imperialists realized that, they shot him <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. Finally, Díaz was rescued by Luis Teran.|$|R
500|$|Known as [...] "Sticks" [...] locally, Silcott {{was living}} in the Martlesham block of the Broadwater Farm estate {{at the time of the}} riots, and was running his greengrocer's shop in the Tangmere block, the block near the spot where Blakelock was killed. He told David Rose in 2004 that he had been in the Tangmere block on the night of the death, and had stopped someone {{throwing}} a scaffolding pole <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> his shop. A friend of his, Pam, had then invited him to her apartment to keep him out of trouble.|$|E
500|$|It {{promoted}} {{itself from}} 1908 as [...] "The Holiday Line {{through a series}} of posters, postcards, jigsaw puzzles, and books. These included Holiday Haunts, describing the attraction of the different parts of the GWR system, and regional titles such as S. P. B. Mais's Cornish Riviera and A. M. Bradley's South Wales: The Country of Castles. Guidebooks described the scenery seen <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Window</b> <b>of</b> their trains. Other GWR books were designed to encourage an interest in the GWR itself. Published as [...] "Books for Boys of All Ages", these included The 10:30 Limited and Loco's of the Royal Road.|$|E
500|$|During the European {{leg of the}} Damage Inc. tour {{in support}} of Master of Puppets, the band complained that the {{sleeping}} cubicles on their tour bus were unsatisfactory and uncomfortable. To decide who received pick of the bunks, Kirk Hammett and Burton drew cards. On the evening of September 26, 1986, Burton won the game with an ace of spades, thereby getting {{the first choice of}} bunk and pointed at Hammett and exclaimed, [...] "I want your bunk!" [...] Hammett replied, [...] "Fine, take my bunk, I'll sleep up front, it's probably better up there anyway." [...] Burton was sleeping shortly before 7am on September 27 when, according to the driver, the bus skidded off the road (the E4, [...] north of Ljungby), and flipped onto the grass in Kronoberg County. Burton was thrown <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>of</b> the bus, which fell on top of him, resulting in his death.|$|E
50|$|Little {{remains of}} the former Italian garden, visible <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall of mirrors—only a few grottoes with niches.

60|$|No one interfered. It {{would have}} seemed as prudent to step between two tigers.
