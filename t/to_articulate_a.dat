5|$|Scottish nineteenth-century Reformed theologian William Cunningham {{also sought}} <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> distinctively Reformed {{theology}} of baptism {{in the modern}} world. Cunningham preferred the writings of Zwingli on the sacraments, writing that Calvin and later Reformed orthodox theologians overly elevated {{the value of the}} sacraments. He argued that the efficacy of baptism only applies to adults expressing faith in the act of baptism.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said his refusal <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> {{specific}} campaign platform {{showed that he}} was trying to be all things to all people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E

2500|$|Hamartiology ( [...] , hamartia, [...] "missing the mark," [...] "sin," [...] + -λογια, -logia, [...] "sayings" [...] or [...] "discourse") is {{the branch}} of Christian theology, more specifically, {{systematic}} theology, which {{is the study of}} sin with <b>a</b> view <b>to</b> <b>articulating</b> <b>a</b> doctrine of it.|$|R
25|$|The French {{mathematician}} Henri Poincaré {{was among}} the first <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> conventionalist view. Poincaré's use of non-Euclidean geometries in his work on differential equations convinced him that Euclidean geometry should not be regarded as a priori truth. He held that axioms in geometry should be chosen for the results they produce, not for their apparent coherence with human intuitions about the physical world.|$|E
25|$|In the {{relatively}} permissive environment of Western host societies, Tamil diaspora association have articulated Tamil grievances, something that many argued {{was not possible}} because of repression in Sri Lanka (see, e.g., Ilankai Tamil Sangam, n.d.). This activism stands {{in contrast to the}} marked lack of participation by Tamils in contemporary Sri Lankan civil society and the impossibility of gauging the views of northeastern Tamils during the conflict. Tamil diaspora activists claim to fill this gap, especially as it is illegal <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> Tamil secessionist position in Sri Lanka.|$|E
25|$|In 1811, Venezuelan {{translator}} Manuel Garcia de Sena {{published a}} book in Philadelphia which consisted mostly of Spanish translations of several of Paine's most important works. The book also included translations of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the U.S. Constitution, and the constitutions of five U.S. states. It subsequently circulated widely in South America, and through it, Uruguayan national hero José Gervasio Artigas became familiar with and embraced Paine's ideas. In turn, many of Artigas's writings drew directly from Paine's, including the Instructions of 1813, which Uruguayans consider {{to be one of}} their country's most important constitutional documents; {{it was one of the}} earliest writings <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> principled basis for an identity independent of Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|A {{homophonic}} texture may be homorhythmic, {{which means}} that all parts have the same rhythm. Chorale texture is another variant of homophony.

500|$|Heavily {{influenced}} by Rousseau's frank and revealing Confessions (1782), Wollstonecraft lays bare her soul in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, detailing {{not only her}} physical but also her psychological journey. Her personal disclosures, like those of other female autobiographers, are presented as [...] "unpremeditated self-revelations" [...] and often appear to be [...] "circuitous". However, as Wollstonecraft scholar Mitzi Myers has made clear, Wollstonecraft manages to use this style of writing <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> stable and comprehensible self for the reader. Increasingly confident in her ability as a writer, she controls the narrative {{and its effect on}} readers to a degree not matched in her other works. She transforms the individual sorrows of her trip, such as the dissolution of her relationship with Imlay, into the stuff of gripping literature.|$|E
500|$|Whitehead has {{had some}} {{influence}} on philosophy of business administration and organizational theory. [...] This has led {{in part to a}} focus on identifying and investigating the effect of temporal events (as opposed to static things) within organizations through an “organization studies” discourse that accommodates a variety of 'weak' and 'strong' process perspectives from a number of philosophers. [...] One of the leading figures having an explicitly Whiteheadian and panexperientialist stance towards management is Mark Dibben, who works in what he calls [...] "applied process thought" [...] <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> philosophy of management and business administration as part of a wider examination of the social sciences through the lens of process metaphysics. For Dibben, this allows [...] "a comprehensive exploration of life as perpetually active experiencing, as opposed to occasional – and thoroughly passive – happening." [...] Dibben has published two books on applied process thought, [...] (2008), and [...] (2009), as well as other papers in this vein in the fields of philosophy of management and business ethics.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{critical}} acclaim [...] "Ulysses" [...] received, its rise within the Tennyson canon took decades. Tennyson did not usually select it {{for publication in}} poetry anthologies; in teaching anthologies, however, the poem was usually included—and it remains a popular teaching poem today. Its current prominence in Tennyson's oeuvre {{is the result of}} two trends, according to Tennyson scholar Matthew Rowlinson: the rise of formal English poetry studies in the late nineteenth century, and the Victorian effort <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> British culture that could be exported. He argues that [...] "Ulysses" [...] forms part of the prehistory of imperialism—a term that only appeared in the language in 1851. The protagonist sounds like a [...] "colonial administrator", and his reference to seeking a newer world (57) echoes the phrase [...] "New World", which became common during the Renaissance. While [...] "Ulysses" [...] cannot be read as overtly imperialistic, Tennyson's later work as Poet Laureate sometimes argues for the value of Britain's colonies, or was accused of jingoism. Rowlinson invokes the Marxist theorist Louis Althusser's extension of the argument that ideology is ahistorical, finding that Tennyson's poem [...] "comes before an ideological construction for which it nonetheless makes people nostalgic".|$|E

The book's forward was written by the then Chief Rabbi, Jonathan Sacks who described Rapoport as [...] "a courageous figure who has written on a difficult subject that many would rather avoid".

2500|$|The {{two major}} genres of furūʿ {{literature}} are the mukhtasar (concise summary of law) and the mabsut (extensive commentary). [...] Mukhtasars were short specialized treatises or general overviews {{that could be}} used in a classroom or consulted by judges. A mabsut, which usually provided a commentary on a mukhtasar and could stretch to dozens of large volumes, recorded alternative rulings with their justifications, often accompanied by a proliferation of cases and conceptual distinctions. The terminology of juristic literature was conservative and tended to preserve notions which had lost their practical relevance. At the same time, the cycle of abridgement and commentary allowed jurists of each generation <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> modified body of law to meet changing social conditions. Other juristic genres include the qawāʿid (succinct formulas meant to aid the student remember general principles) and collections of fatwas by a particular scholar.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Eric Yoffie, {{president}} of the Union for Reform Judaism, called J Street's reaction to the Israeli invasion of Gaza [...] "morally deficient, profoundly {{out of touch with}} Jewish sentiment and also appallingly naïve". J Street responded stating, [...] "It is hard for us to understand how the leading reform rabbi in North America could call our effort <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> nuanced view on these difficult issues 'morally deficient'. If our views are 'naive' and 'morally deficient', then so are the views of scores of Israeli journalists, security analysts, distinguished authors, and retired IDF officers who have posed the same questions about the Gaza attack as we have." [...] Despite this rebuttal, J Street subsequently invited Yoffie to its 2009 convention, and he subsequently praised the organization's stance on the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, which was closer to that of other American Jewish organizations.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{institution}} was reopened, it {{was marked by}} the new leadership of president S.C. Yoder and dean Harold S. Bender, a man whose influence upon the [...] "Old" [...] Mennonites was significant {{for much of the}} 20th century. Bender carefully piloted the stormy waters of theology by stating that Mennonitism was not liberalism. Bender later {{went on to say that}} fundamentalism also contributed to problems with theology and created The Anabaptist Vision, a [...] "third way" [...] that sought to spell out the direction for the future Mennonite Church. More than arguing doctrine, Bender and a younger group of intellectuals at Goshen College sought to shape the Mennonite faith that was more ideological than institutional. The goal was <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> faith that could stand the test of academic scrutiny in broader society while carefully upholding traditional beliefs of the church. Out of this ideology, Bender started The Mennonite Quarterly Review. Throughout this time, Goshen remained the epicenter of [...] "Old" [...] Mennonite theology and higher education, and became known as the [...] "Goshen Historical Renaissance".|$|E
2500|$|Adorno's work in {{the years}} before his death was shaped by the idea of [...] "negative dialectics", set out {{especially}} in his book of that title. A key notion {{in the work of the}} Frankfurt School since Dialectic of Enlightenment had been the idea of thought becoming an instrument of domination that subsumes all objects under the control of the (dominant) subject, especially through the notion of identity, i.e. of identifying as real in nature and society only that which harmonized or fit with dominant concepts, and regarding as unreal or non-existent everything that did not. [...] Adorno's [...] "negative dialectics" [...] was an attempt <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> non-dominating thought that would recognize its limitations and accept the non-identity and reality of that which could not be subsumed under the subject's concepts. Indeed, Adorno sought to ground the critical bite of his sociological work in his critique of identity, which he took to be a reification in thought of the commodity form or exchange relation which always presumes a false identity between different things. The potential to criticise arises from the gap between the concept and the object, which can never go into the former without remainder. This gap, this non-identity in identity, was the secret to a critique of both material life and conceptual reflection.|$|E
