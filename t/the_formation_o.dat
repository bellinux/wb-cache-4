40|$|This {{paper was}} {{published}} in the journal Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics and the definitive published version is available at [URL] H 2 O splitting mechanism is a very attractive alternative used in electrochemistry for <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of <b>O</b> 3. <b>The</b> most efficient catalysts employed for this reaction at room temperature are SnO 2 -based, in particular the Ni/Sb-SnO 2 catalyst. In order to investigate the H 2 O splitting mechanism Density Functional Theory (DFT) was performed on a Ni/Sb-SnO 2 surface with oxygen vacancies. By calculating different SnO 2 facets, the (110) facet was deemed most stable, and further doped with Sb and Ni. On this surface, the H 2 O splitting mechanism was modelled paying particular attention to the final two steps, <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of <b>O</b> 2 and O 3. Previous studies on β-PbO 2 have shown that the final step in <b>the</b> reaction (<b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of <b>O</b> 3) occurs via an Eley-Rideal style interaction where surface O 2 desorbs before attacking surface O to form O 3. It is revealed that for Ni/Sb-SnO 2, although the overall reaction is the same the surface mechanism is different. <b>The</b> <b>formation</b> of <b>O</b> 3 is found to occur through a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism as opposed to Eley-Rideal.
