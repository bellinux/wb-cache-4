5|$|Pavo is {{the radiant}} of two annual meteor showers: the Delta Pavonids and August Pavonids. Appearing from 21 March to 8 April and {{generally}} peaking around 5 and 6 April, Delta Pavonids are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> with Comet Grigg-Mellish. The shower {{was discovered by}} Michael Buhagiar from Perth, Australia, who observed meteors on six occasions between 1969 and 1980. The August Pavonids peak around August 31 and are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> with the Halley-type Comet Levy (P/1991 L3).|$|E

5|$|RAFA domains, or {{polymorphic}} interphase karyosomal associations, {{were first}} described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function remains unclear, {{though they were}} not thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> with active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing. They {{have been found to}} often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the transcription factor PTF, which promotes transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA).|$|E

5|$|Activity at Incapillo {{commenced}} {{shortly after}} the end of the Maricunga Belt volcanism and occurred first at Monte Pissis between 6.5 and 3.5mya. Later volcanism occurred south of Incapillo 4.7±0.5mya, at Sierra de Veladero 5.6±1–3.6±0.5mya, and in the region of Cerro Bonete Chico 5.2±0.6–3.5±0.1mya. Some of the 32mya Pircas Negras mafic andesites appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> with the Incapillo volcanic complex. These rocks form the last pulse of the Pircas Negras volcanism. Specific ages of the Pircas Negras flows in the Incapillo region include 4.7±0.5mya, 3.2±0.3mya and 1.9±0.2mya. Later, andesitic-rhyolitic volcanism formed ignimbrites and lava domes 2.9±0.4–1.1±0.4mya, with the youngest pre-caldera dome being 0.873±0.077mya old. The lava domes formed through non-explosive extrusion.|$|E

This is a variant of {{a story that has}} also been connected to the Agglestone Rock near Studland. According to stories associated with this large sandstone block, it had been thrown by the Devil from The Needles on the Isle of Wight, with the intention of hitting either the castle, Sherborne Abbey, Bindon Abbey, or Salisbury Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|After {{the nine}} Études-Tableaux, Op. 39, Rachmaninoff {{composed}} several minor works in 1917. The Oriental Sketch is a fast-paced piece littered with sixteenth note figures. The piece {{was not intended}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> with the Orient; the title was given by the publisher. The Prelude in D minor, a dark piece with thick and fast moving chords that repeatedly descend into low register, is a manifestation of his unhappiness with the October Revolution. The manuscript survived and {{was first published in}} 1973. His penultimate piano composition (only his Corelli Variations came later) was a one-page piece entitled Fragments, a brief nostalgic piece from his final days in Moscow. It was first published in the magazine, The Etude, in 1919.|$|E
