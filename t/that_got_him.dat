In early 1990 Sato along with former rival Pat Tanaka were introduced to the WWF as The Orient Express by manager Mr. Fuji. During this run, Sato introduced the Sitout Powerbomb to mainstream American wrestling for the first time. The Orient Express kicked off a prolonged feud with The Rockers that started at WrestleMania VI and continued off and on for well over a year. The Orient Express got involved in the Legion of Doom / Demolition feud because Mr. Fuji managed both teams. Demolition was being phased out and the Orient Express took on the Legion of Doom instead. The Legion of Doom / Orient Express feud was extremely onesided due to the Legion of Doom’s massive size advantage.|$|E

Johann Schmidt watches Rogers fight, and recalls how he got to this point: meeting Adolf Hitler; capturing Arnim Zola to research creating super soldiers; and finding Abraham Erskine and blackmailing him into continuing his super soldier research under the employ of the Nazis. Howard Stark, via radio, assists Rogers, remembering when he was recruited by Colonel Phillips to join the Strategic Scientific Reserve, and when he helped Peggy Carter rescue Erskine from Schmidt. Dum Dum Dugan and the Howling Commandos arrive to assist Rogers, and they remember their formation—thrust together in a Hydra work camp, forming close friendships after a failed escape attempt.

500|$|Among {{the major}} trade journals, Todd McCarthy of Variety called the film an [...] "expansively {{entertaining}} special effects extravaganza" [...] with [...] "fresh energy and stylistic polish", while Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film, while nonetheless finding [...] "disappointment [...] a climatic [...] battle between different Iron Man prototypes [...] how did Tony's nemesis {{learn how to}} use the suit?" [...] In one of the first major-daily newspaper reviews, Frank Lovece of Newsday lauded the film's [...] "emotional truth [...] pitch-perfect casting and plausibly rendered super-science" [...] that made it [...] "faithful to the source material while updating it [...] and recognizing what's made that material so enduring isn't just the high-tech cool of a man in a metal suit, but the human condition <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> there". A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film [...] "an unusually good superhero picture. Or at least – since it certainly has its problems – a superhero movie that's good in unusual ways." [...] Among the specialty press, Garth Franklin of Dark Horizons commended the [...] "impressive sets and mechanics that combine smoothly with relatively seamless CG", and said, [...] "Robert Downey Jr., along with director Jon Favreau [...] help this rise above formula. The result is something that, whilst hardly original or groundbreaking, is nevertheless refreshing in its earnestness to avoid dark dramatic stylings in favor of an easy-going, crowd-pleasing action movie with a sprinkle of anti-war and redemption themes".|$|E
500|$|Jason Dante was Nate's {{old friend}} who halfway helps him find a lost city of Spaniards and an {{antagonist}} of Uncharted: Golden Abyss.

500|$|His {{first major}} project was Something for the Weekend (1996), {{which he wrote}} and produced. Initially called The Barber Shop, the title was changed to avoid a clash with another film. His directorial debut, the short A Secret Audience, centres on a meeting between Napoleon Bonaparte and Pope Pius VII. His second short, Bring Me Your Love, {{was based on the}} short story by Charles Bukowski, and stars Ian Hart as a {{journalist}} bringing flowers to his wife in a mental hospital. It was screened in front of Some Voices. An Independent critic wrote that Bring Me Your Love [...] "holds out great promise" [...] for Morrissey and an Observer reviewer wrote that it was worth seeing but was not as impressive as A Secret Audience. Bring Me Your Love was produced by Tubedale Films, a studio Morrissey formed with his brother Paul and wife Esther Freud. In 2001, Morrissey directed Sweet Revenge, a two-part BBC television film starring Paul McGann <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> a BAFTA nomination for Best New Director (Fiction). In 2004, Morrissey reunited with Tony Marchant to direct the two-part television film Passer By, about a man (James Nesbitt) who witnesses an attack on a woman (Emily Bruni) but does nothing to stop it. Morrissey was brought onto the project after reading the first draft of Marchant's script. The script went through five more drafts before being filmed over 30 days. Morrissey developed his directing techniques by watching the directors on films and television series that he acted in; he took the minor role of Tom Keylock in Stoned so that he could watch Stephen Woolley at work.|$|E
500|$|One of Blow's {{goals for}} The Witness {{was to explore}} the types of non-verbal {{communication}} {{that can be achieved}} by the medium of video games, an exploration he felt to be important to understanding them as an art form. The name The Witness is derived from core gameplay aspect of making the player perceptive of the surroundings to discover meaning and solutions to the puzzles without verbal communication, a similar approach taken by Myst (1993). Blow attributes much of The Witnesss design to Myst, a game <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> into video game development. One aspect of Myst that Blow desired to correct was the nature of [...] "pixel hunting" [...] in some of its puzzles; the player would have to click on various parts of the virtual machinery without knowing what the end result was until sometime later in the puzzle. Within The Witness, Blow created a unifying mechanic for all the puzzles to avoid this confusion, using the maze panels as this mechanic. While the interaction mechanics are the same for all these mazes, the rules and behavior described by the game's symbolic language that limit or result from the interactions form the core of the puzzles in the game. The island was divided into sections so that all the information the player needed to understand the specific behavior of puzzles in that section would be in one general location, a means to [...] " [...] down a lot of ambiguity that used to exist in adventure games". Puzzles within the game were designed to be meaningful {{within the context of the}} game, rather than to be simply a puzzle to be solved, and further aimed to be different from any other puzzle within the game.|$|E
