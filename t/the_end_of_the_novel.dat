5|$|According to {{continuation}} Bond author Raymond Benson, {{there was}} {{further development of}} the Bond character in Thunderball, with glimpses of both his sense of humour and his own sense of mortality being shown. Felix Leiter had his largest role to date in a Bond story and much of his humour came though, whilst his incapacity, suffered in Live and Let Die, had not led to bitterness or to his being unable to join in with the underwater fight scene towards <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nan's {{experiences}} eventually reveal serious faults of {{the society}} she moves through, the primary element of a picaresque novel. For this and other reasons, Waters' books are frequently compared to stories by Charles Dickens; the reader follows Nan's movement from sheltered naif to exuberant theatre performer to rent-boy to mistress to housewife then socialist orator, showing allegiance to none of these professions or ideals. Michael Upchurch in The Seattle Times writes that Nan's inability or unwillingness to adhere to any profession or setting, remaining malleable until <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> indicates she is her own worst enemy. Likewise, Marianne Brace in The Independent considers Nan selfish and unsympathetic.|$|E

5|$|The film {{is based}} on the 1986 novel by Winston Groom. Both center on the {{character}} of Forrest Gump. However, the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel, before skipping ahead to <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> with the founding of Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. and the meeting with Forrest, Jr. In addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to Gump's life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the United States.|$|E

This leaves Paloma and Ozu devastated but leads Paloma not to commit suicide.|$|E
5|$|Corentin and Madame du Gua, foils to {{the happy}} couple, plot and scheme {{endlessly}} {{to bring about}} the misery and downfall of those who will not love them. Du Gua is at first a sympathetic character, but by <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> she is presented as sharing a face with a spirit from hell. She represents revenge and hatred chiseled from romantic injury, and has been noted as a rough sketch of the title character in Balzac's La Cousine Bette. Corentin, meanwhile, stands in contrast to Montauran's romantic nature as much as to Hulot's military prowess. Rebuffed by Marie and unable to wield the might of the commandant, Corentin relies on trickery and deception to achieve his ruthless ends.|$|E
5|$|For {{three of}} the novels, Goldfinger, Live and Let Die and Dr. No, it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what {{turns out to be}} an American problem, and Black points out that {{although}} it is American assets that are under threat in Dr. No, a British agent and a British warship, HMS Narvik, are sent with British soldiers to the island at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> to settle the matter. Fleming became increasingly jaundiced about America, and his comments in the penultimate novel You Only Live Twice reflect this; Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America—in sharp contrast to the warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.|$|E

To their surprise, the team finds Ford alive and {{with a group of}} nomadic humans known as the Travelers. He explains to Sheppard he managed to escape the hive ship before it was destroyed, but crashed on the planet over which the battle took place. With the help of the Travelers, he recovered from his addiction but it took so long that he could no longer find Atlantis afterwards.

5|$|In Apur Panchali (the Bengali {{translation}} of , 1994), Ray {{wrote that he}} had omitted many of the novel's characters {{and that he had}} rearranged some of its sequences to make the narrative better as cinema. Changes include Indir's death, which occurs early in the novel at a village shrine in the presence of adults, while in the film Apu and Durga find her corpse in the open. The scene of Apu and Durga running {{to catch a glimpse of}} the train is not in the novel, in which neither child sees the train, although they try. Durga's fatal fever is attributed to a monsoon downpour in the film, but is unexplained in the novel. The ending of the film—the family's departure from the village—is not <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Maier {{writes that}} the novel {{includes}} themes of love, with Hidjo's love for Woengoe, Betje, and Biroe paralleling that of Walter's love for Roos, Woengoe, and Betje. He also notes {{that there is a}} theme of social mobility, where Hidjo's relationships with noble women are fostered by his merchant father to grant the family a greater social position; bride prices also feature prominently, showing that one can become a noble through marriage if one has enough money. He notes that, towards <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> love is described as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find, as the social-financial meaning of marriage remains predominant among the traditional Javanese. The characters, despite not all marrying for love, are happy with their eventual partners and have a comfortable life.|$|E
