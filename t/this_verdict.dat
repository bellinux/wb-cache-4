5|$|All {{but one of}} the passengers' {{families}} settled their cases. After {{a four-day}} jury trial in Lexington, Kentucky, that ended on December 7, 2009, the estate and daughters of 39‑year‑old Bryan Woodward were awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $7.1million. While Comair challenged <b>this</b> <b>verdict</b> as excessive, on April 2, 2010, Judge Forester overruled Comair's objections and upheld the verdict.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} morning the prosecution {{announced that it}} would file an appeal against <b>this</b> <b>verdict,</b> thus further dragging out the affair another year. Villepin was finally cleared by an appeals court in September 2011.|$|E
25|$|However, Judge Robert A. Cooper did {{not approve}} of <b>this</b> <b>verdict.</b> He called {{for a new trial}} and a new jury, which was {{composed}} of ten Americans and two Puerto Ricans. This second jury concluded that the defendants were guilty.|$|E

50|$|He {{was then}} convicted {{by a jury}} on September 7, 1978 after 8 hours of {{deliberation}} on all 28 counts of the indictment. <b>This</b> guilty <b>verdict</b> was overturned on December 16, 1985 because the Appellate Division found that self-incriminating statements had been made without a lawyer present.|$|R

25|$|Peruvian Minister of Justice Maria Zavala {{has stated}} that <b>this</b> <b>verdict</b> by the IACHR {{supports}} the Peruvian government's extradition of Fujimori from Chile. Though the IACHR verdict does not directly implicate Fujimori, it does fault the Peruvian government for its complicity in the 1992 Cantuta University killings.|$|E
25|$|The Anwar Ibrahim sodomy {{trials are}} a source of {{considerable}} political controversy in Malaysia. The first trial was held in 1998, and resulted in former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim being convicted, and given a nine-year prison sentence. <b>This</b> <b>verdict</b> was overturned in 2004, resulting in Anwar's release from prison.|$|E
25|$|In 1835, the post’s gunsmith, Thomas J. Hubbard, {{attacked}} {{and killed the}} fort’s tailor in an argument over a young Native girl. The naturalist John Kirk Townsend was appointed magistrate, although {{he was a friend}} of Hubbard's. The jury acquitted Hubbard when they ruled the death was justifiable homicide. <b>This</b> <b>verdict</b> was likely the result of evidence that the tailor had alcohol-induced rages.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "motion for {{judgment}} n.o.v." [...] (non obstante veredicto, or {{notwithstanding the}} verdict) asks {{the court to}} reverse the jurys verdict {{on the grounds that}} the jury could not reasonably have reached such a <b>verdict.</b> <b>This</b> motion is made after the jurys verdict. If granted, the court enters a new <b>verdict.</b> <b>This</b> motion can be used in a criminal case only to reverse a guilty verdict; not guilty verdicts are immune to reversal by the court.|$|R
5000|$|The {{general rule}} is that an accused who has pleaded is {{entitled}} to a <b>verdict.</b> <b>This</b> {{does not mean that}} the accused is entitled to a verdict immediately; it means only that proceedings may not be concluded without reaching a <b>verdict.</b> <b>This</b> contrasts with the situation where the accused has not pleaded: Here the case could, for example, be withdrawn, and the accused would not be entitled to a verdict. An exception is mentioned in section 106(4), where there is a plea that the court has no jurisdiction to try the offence.|$|R
50|$|In 1936, the {{defendants}} were tried, some {{for the fourth}} time, again for rape. In <b>this</b> trial, the <b>verdicts</b> were again guilty, but sentences were long prison terms, rather than the death penalty.|$|R
25|$|In {{the case}} Waverley Transit vs Metropolitan Transit Authority, Waverley Transit {{launched}} a Supreme Court {{challenge to the}} results of the tendering process. The verdict deemed that the State Government had acted inappropriately during the tendering process and restored the bus routes to Ventura and Waverley Transit. In the wake of <b>this</b> <b>verdict,</b> the Met launched an appeal, with Waverley Transit launching a counter-appeal; the cases lasted into the early 1990s, with Waverley Transit ultimately successful.|$|E
25|$|Jill Dando {{was shot}} dead outside her home on 26 April 1999. George (who {{at the time of}} the murder lived in a ground floor flat in Crookham Road, Fulham) was arrested for her murder on 25 May 2000, and charged on 29 May 2000. He was convicted by a {{majority}} of ten to one, and given a sentence of life imprisonment on 2 July 2001. <b>This</b> <b>verdict</b> was considered unsafe by some observers at the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{company in}} charge of the uranium {{production}} in São Paulo was the former Nuclemon Mínero-Química, which has now been absorbed into INB. In 2007, the Brazilian Labor Court mandated that INB provide lifelong, free health insurance to the former workers of Nuclemon. <b>This</b> <b>verdict</b> was the outcome of a long lawsuit, which argued that throughout the 1980s and 1990s Nuclemon workers had no substantial information about the risks they faced and were constantly exposed to radioactive and toxic substances.|$|E

5000|$|The Country Captain was revived {{early in}} the Restoration period. Samuel Pepys saw it {{performed}} on 21 October 1661. In his Diary he called it [...] "so silly a play as {{in all my life}} I never saw" [...] - [...] though <b>this</b> negative <b>verdict</b> did not prevent Pepys from seeing the play again on 25 November that year, on 14 August 1667 and on 14 May 1668.|$|R
50|$|Even if the {{statement}} {{does not constitute}} an unequivocal admission to the main charge alleged, but objectively constitutes a full admission to some lesser charge (competent <b>verdict),</b> <b>this</b> will amount to confession, and section 217 will apply.|$|R
25|$|Jury {{trials have}} been very slowly {{introduced}} in Spain and have often produced less than desirable results. One of the first cases was that of Mikel Otegi who was tried in 1997 {{for the murder of}} two police officers. After a confused trial, five jury members of a total of nine voted to acquit and the judge ordered the accused set free. <b>This</b> <b>verdict</b> shocked the nation. Another alleged miscarriage of justice by jury trial was the Wanninkhof murder case.|$|E
25|$|The matter {{became a}} scandal in French {{politics}} and Bourbons officials {{tried to cover}} it up. At his court martial at Port de Rochefort in 1817 Chaumareys was tried on five counts but acquitted of abandoning his squadron, of failing to re-float his ship and of abandoning the raft. However he {{was found guilty of}} incompetent and complacent navigation and of abandoning the Méduse before all her passengers had been taken off. Even though <b>this</b> <b>verdict</b> exposed him to the death penalty, Chaumareys was sentenced to only three years in jail.|$|E
25|$|While {{the family}} {{may never know}} what has {{happened}} to Caylee Marie Anthony, they now have closure for this chapter of their life. They will now begin the long process of rebuilding their lives. Despite the baseless defense chosen by Casey Anthony, the family believes that the Jury made a fair decision based on the evidence presented, the testimony presented, the scientific information presented and the rules that were given to them by the Honorable Judge Perry to guide them. The family hopes that they will be given the time by the media to reflect on <b>this</b> <b>verdict</b> and decide the best way to move forward privately.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} subsequently challenged {{this order}} through Interlocutory Application No. 8 of 2011. The bench (consisting of Justice Altamas Kabir {{in place of}} Justice B Sudershan Reddy, since Justice Reddy retired) on 23 September 2011 pronounced a split verdict on whether government plea is maintainable. Justice Kabir said that the plea is maintainable while Justice Nijjar said it is not. Due to <b>this</b> split <b>verdict,</b> the matter will be referred to a third judge.|$|R
5000|$|The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders said it, [...] "denounces <b>this</b> new {{arbitrary}} <b>verdict</b> against Mr. Kouhyar Goudarzi {{since it}} seems to merely aim at sanctioning his legitimate human rights activities, amid the continuing repression of the Iranian civil society." ...|$|R
50|$|This can—using the {{judicial}} analogue above—be {{compared with the}} truly guilty defendant who is released just because the proof {{is not enough for}} a guilty <b>verdict.</b> <b>This</b> does not prove the defendant's innocence, but only that there is not proof enough for a guilty verdict.|$|R
25|$|Another {{murder that}} caused great {{upheaval}} {{took place on}} 2 November 2004, when film director and publicist Theo van Gogh was assassinated by a Dutch-Moroccan youth with radical Islamic beliefs, because of Van Gogh's alleged blasphemy. One week later, several arrests were made of several would-be Islamist terrorists, who have later been found guilty of conspiracy with terrorist intentions, <b>this</b> <b>verdict</b> was however reversed on appeal. All this sparked a debate on the position of radical Islam and of Islam generally in Dutch society, and on immigration and integration. The personal protection of most politicians, especially of the Islam critic Ayaan Hirsi Ali, was stepped up to unprecedented levels.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{not being}} famous, Yonai made {{significant}} decisions that depict his strong moral character. At his appointment as Prime Minister, {{he retired from}} active service of the Imperial Japanese Navy without being asked to. He intended not to control his cabinet ministers by naval influences. <b>This</b> <b>verdict</b> was momentous. Because once military personnel retires, he loses effects on the military, hence all the generals and admirals rebuffed to retire. Indeed, Tojo Hideki, the 40th Prime Minister did not retire at his promotion to Prime Minister. He persisted with active service in the Imperial Japanese Army to uphold his effects over it, and the cabinet participants. Because of Yonai’s retirement from the Imperial Japanese Navy, the Yonai Cabinet was cooperative. One prominent evidence of this was that: nevertheless his cabinet had continued just a half a year, his cabinet members and followers formed a friendly reunion right after his resignation in 1937, and it still lasting in the Heisei period (1989–present). This reunion is named Ichi-Roku Kai, which means sixteenth gathering, because Yonai's appointment and resignation as a Prime Minister both happened on the 16th day of their months.|$|E
25|$|Ben {{is arrested}} on {{suspicion}} of killing Lucy. Phil suspects he did and practically disowns him, handing in critical evidence to the police. However, Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) tells Phil that she thinks her father, Max, killed Lucy, so Phil punches Max and hopes Ben will be released. Phil finds out that his wife Sharon has been helping friend Jane cover up the real killer Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington), Lucy's half-brother, Phil tells Jane and Sharon that he will bribe the foreman of the jury to make sure Max is not guilty. The jury find Max guilty and it emerges that Phil paid the foreman for <b>this</b> <b>verdict.</b> Sharon discovers this and kicks him out of their home. He then discovers that Ben is in {{a sexual relationship with}} Paul Coker (Jonny Labey) and is kidnapped by Kathy's husband Gavin. Weeks later, the police find Phil's blood in Gavin's sister's home. A week later, Phil returns home, battered and bruised. He collapses and is taken to hospital, where they discover he has several broken bones from two days before. He then asks Ben for alcohol, revealing he has been drinking during his kidnapping.|$|E

500|$|... "As full {{of variety}} as nature itself", stated Pliny's nephew, Pliny the Younger, and <b>this</b> <b>verdict</b> largely {{explains}} {{the appeal of}} the Natural History since Pliny's death in the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79.

500|$|An inquest into Perceval's {{death was}} held on 12 May, at the Rose and Crown public house in Downing Street. Among those who gave {{evidence}} were Gascoyne, Smith, and Joseph Hume, a doctor and Radical MP. He had helped to detain Bellingham, and now testified that from his controlled behaviour after the shooting, Bellingham appeared [...] "perfectly sane". The coroner duly registered {{the cause of death}} as [...] "wilful murder by John Bellingham".

There it was, and nothing he could do or say would alter it; no condemnation of <b>this</b> idiotic <b>verdict</b> would help reverse it. The situation was desperate, indeed!
