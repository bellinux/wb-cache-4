5|$|The Bills {{posted a}} 7–6–1 record again in 1963, {{but this time}} it was enough to tie with the Patriots for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern {{division}}.

Therefore, Maryland had been declared {{the national championship}} team by the Associated Press, United Press, and International News Service, and remained the consensus national champions despite the loss.

5|$|General Manager Bryan Colangelo {{continued}} to surround Bosh with complementary players, and signed two-time Euroleague Most Valuable Player Anthony Parker. Spanish international Jorge Garbajosa and former slam dunk champion Fred Jones were also signed from free agency. The Raptors concluded pre-season transactions by re-signing veteran Darrick Martin. With this new lineup, Toronto looked {{to maintain a}} team who could both pass and shoot the ball, but was also stronger defensively than the 2005–06 roster. As a showcase of their new roster, on 15 October 2006, the 119 points by Toronto marked the third highest total in a pre-season game in franchise history. The Raptors finished the pre-season with a 7–1 win-loss record, which was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league and a franchise record.|$|E

In a 14-year span beginning in 1933, New York qualified {{to play in the}} NFL championship game eight times, winning twice (1934 and 1938). They did not win another championship until 1956, aided by several future Hall of Fame players such as running back Frank Gifford, linebacker Sam Huff, and offensive tackle Roosevelt Brown. From 1958 to 1963, the Giants played in the NFL championship game five times, but failed to win. The 1958 NFL Championship game, in which they lost 23–17 in overtime to the Baltimore Colts, is credited with increasing the popularity of the NFL in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In the 2006–07 season, the Spurs lacked {{energy from}} their {{reserves}} and Ginóbili provided it by {{coming off the}} bench {{for most of the}} second half of the season helping the Spurs attain <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half of the season. Ginóbili produced numbers closely identical to his successful 2004–05 campaign despite starting in only 36 of 75 games, his second lowest since arriving at San Antonio. The 2007 NBA Playoffs saw him help the Spurs to defeat the Denver Nuggets, Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz, before sweeping the Cleveland Cavaliers to win his third and San Antonio's fourth championship.|$|E

The non-affiliated Bucks had a record of 30–46 with Stein as the manager. He was hired to be the manager of the Clinton Giants in 1992. Clinton was the Class-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants at the time. Stein led Clinton to a 59–79 record that year. After considering taking a year off of baseball in 1994, Stein eventually accepted the managerial position with the independent league Tyler WildCatters.|$|E

In Week 3, in the first quarter against the New York Giants Van Buren scored his 39th career rushing touchdown, surpassing Ernie Nevers as the all-time leader. That game—a 45–0 shutout win—was the first in an eight-game winning streak for the Eagles in which they scored 275 points total and allowed 49.

5|$|The Hitmen have {{finished}} with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> WHL four times, and {{qualified for the}} playoffs for thirteen consecutive seasons between 1998 and 2010.

The Hitmen hold numerous WHL attendance records, and in 2004–05 became the first team in Canadian Hockey League history to average 10,000 fans per game. Thirty-nine former Hitmen players have gone on to play in the National Hockey League.|$|E
5|$|The playoff {{structure}} {{used from}} 1933 to 1966 was considered inequitable by some {{because of the}} number of times it failed to match the teams with the two best records in the championship game, as only the conference winners would qualify for playoff contention. Four times between 1950 and 1966 (in 1951, 1956, 1960, and 1963) the team with the second-best win-loss record did not qualify for the playoffs while the team with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other conference, but only the third-best in the league, would advance to the championship game.|$|E

The team was also the league's best scoring with an average of 3.38 goals scored per game. The Avalanche met the two lowest seeds of the Western Conference in the first two rounds of the playoffs: the Chicago Blackhawks and the Edmonton Oilers, and defeated them in six games and five games, respectively. During a rematch of the previous year Western Conference Finals, the Avalanche lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games. Detroit went on to sweep the Stanley Cup Finals just as the Avalanche had done the year before. Sandis Ozolinsh was elected for the league's first All-Star team {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

The Giants 1956 Championship team not only comprised players who would eventually find their way to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but it also had a Hall of Fame coaching staff. Head coach Jim Lee Howell's staff had Vince Lombardi coaching the offense and Tom Landry coaching the defense. From 1958 to 1963, New York played in the NFL championship game five out of those six years, but failed to win.

Led by consensus league Most Valuable Player (MVP) linebacker Lawrence Taylor and Super Bowl MVP quarterback Phil Simms, the Giants posted a 14–2 record during the regular season, tied for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league with the defending Super Bowl champion Chicago Bears and the best in team history. The Giants improved on their 10–6 record from 1985, won their first division championship since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970, and won Super Bowl XXI against the Denver Broncos.|$|E

The team again disappointed in the playoffs, falling to the Moose Jaw Warriors in the Eastern Conference semi-final. Pogge's performance during the season earned him honours as both the WHL player of the year and CHL goaltender of the year. Calgary fell to third in the Central Division in 2006–07. In the playoffs, they upset the Kootenay Ice, who finished 19-points ahead of Calgary in the regular season. The Hitmen then defeated the East Division champion Brandon Wheat Kings to reach the Eastern Conference final for the fourth time in franchise history, where they were subsequently defeated by the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|The Crew's {{performance}} improved remarkably in the 2008 season. Schmid adjusted their offensive {{tactics to}} be based on ball possession and flank speed.

With a 1–0 victory over the Houston Dynamo at Crew Stadium on April 26, Schmid became the second MLS coach to win 100 regular-season games. The Crew {{went on to win the}} Supporters' Shield with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league. In the playoffs, Columbus defeated the New York Red Bulls 3–1 at Schmid's former home stadium, Los Angeles's Home Depot Center, to win the MLS Cup. Schmid received the Coach of the Year Award for the second time. Part of the success was attributed to Schmid's restructuring of the squad in 2006 and 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees' 1980s demise and {{downfall}} {{continued into}} the early 1990s and was at its frustrating peak in 1994, when they finished with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>record</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American League in a season that was prematurely halted by the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, which left New York sports fans disappointed that Mattingly had not played in a postseason despite being poised to do so that year. At that time, he led active players in both games played and at-bats without participating in a postseason game. Throughout October, the news media added to the embarrassment when they often made references to dates that games in the World Series would have been played. That year, the Yankees and Red Sox would have finished the season against each other at Fenway Park.
