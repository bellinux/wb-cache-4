5|$|Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes is a fangame {{developed}} by the international team Kajar Laboratories as a ROM hack of Square's role-playing video game Chrono <b>Trigger</b> <b>for</b> the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was conceived as an unofficial installment in the Chrono series, set between the events of Chrono Trigger and its sequel Chrono Cross.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the galactic}} tide, the main <b>trigger</b> <b>for</b> sending comets {{into the inner}} Solar System {{is thought to be}} {{interaction}} between the Sun's Oort cloud and the gravitational fields of nearby stars or giant molecular clouds. The orbit of the Sun through the plane of the Milky Way sometimes brings it in relatively close proximity to other stellar systems. For example, it is hypothesized that 70thousand years ago, perhaps Scholz's star passed through the outer Oort cloud (although its low mass and high relative velocity limited its effect). During the next 10million years the known star with the greatest possibility of perturbing the Oort cloud is Gliese 710. This process could also scatter Oort cloud objects out of the ecliptic plane, potentially also explaining its spherical distribution.|$|E

5|$|Donald Canfield {{detected}} {{records of}} the first significant quantities of atmospheric oxygen just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared– {{and the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen was soon heralded as a possible <b>trigger</b> <b>for</b> the Ediacaran radiation. Oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses; the rise of small, sessile (stationary) organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event, with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of oxygenation. However, the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of atmospheric composition have attracted some criticism, with widespread anoxia having little effect on life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|Henry is {{generally}} credited with initiating the English Reformation – {{the process of}} transforming England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one – though his progress at the elite and mass levels is disputed, and the precise narrative not widely agreed. Certainly, in 1527, Henry, until then an observant and well-informed Catholic, appealed to the Pope for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine. No annulment was immediately forthcoming, the result in part of Charles V's control of the Papacy. The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the <b>trigger</b> <b>for</b> Henry's rejection of papal supremacy (which he had previously defended), though as historian A. F. Pollard has argued, even if Henry had not needed an annulment, Henry may have come to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Tehama collapsed along a series of fault lines which criss-crossed it. The <b>trigger</b> <b>for</b> th{{is possible}} collapse {{may have been the}} release of the extensive amounts of lava that formed the dacite domes on its flank. More likely, the volcano weathered away; hot volcanic gases and steam turned hard rock into soft clay that were easily eroded by glacial action. Either way, the largest remnants of Tehama include Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Conard, Mount Diller, and Pilot Pinnacle. Andesites erupted again in the area starting approximately 300,000 years ago and dacite erupted in the area between 250,000 and 200,000 years ago and 100,000 years ago through the present.|$|E

She listened to the song with Madonna a number of times and together decided to include the ecstasy part. A sub-plot about Madonna as a homicide witness was included, which became the <b>trigger</b> <b>for</b> the sexual and religious ecstasy. Actor Leon Robinson was hired {{to play the role of}} a saint; the part was inspired by Martin de Porres, the patron saint of mixed-race people and all those seeking interracial harmony.|$|E
5|$|Sati– A Meluhan princess, {{she is the}} {{daughter}} of King Daksha. Shiva falls in love with her and marries her. Sati is a skilled swords-woman and is very brave since childhood. She assists Shiva on his journey to destroy Evil, but dies a valiant death while saving her people from a group of assassins. Her death becomes a <b>trigger</b> <b>for</b> the wars to cease. She is later renowned as Goddess Shakti, and her ashes are spread throughout India, in places later known as Shakti Peethas (Seat of Shakti).|$|E
5|$|The colonial {{government}} in the Congo depended on its military to maintain civil order and, above all, it depended on the loyalty of the native troops who made {{up the bulk of}} the Force Publique. Black non-commissioned Officers led by First Sergeant-Major Ngoie Mukalabushi, a veteran of the East Africa Campaign, munitied at Luluabourg in the central Congolese province of Kasaï in February 1944; the <b>trigger</b> <b>for</b> this was a plan to vaccinate troops who had served at the front, though the soldiers were also unhappy about the demands placed on them and their treatment by their white officers.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} team {{designed the}} online multiplayer component {{to be balanced}} and rewarding for new players while still offering something for experienced players. An early idea to implement air support (air strikes and attack helicopters) involved players fighting over special zones to access a <b>trigger</b> <b>for</b> air support against enemies. This idea was discarded because it discouraged the type of deathmatch gameplay they intended. The kill streak reward system was put in its place to encourage the improvement of player skills. Players were allowed to select weapons before matches to get accustomed to weapons more easily and minimize weapon hunting. Maps were designed primarily for deathmatch games—the developers felt such designs suited other types of gameplay as well. Map layouts were designed to minimize locations players could hide from enemy gunfire.|$|E
5|$|The second {{version of}} the project, {{tentatively}} called Chrono Trigger: Brink of Time then Chrono Resurrection, started development in April 2003. Lazur has given several reasons to explain his willingness to restart the project, including his experience coding for the Dreamcast Visual Memory Unit, programming for game developer DC Studios, and playing Chrono Cross, the official sequel to Chrono <b>Trigger</b> <b>for</b> PlayStation. Unlike CT64, the second version would be a short demo developed in a cross-platform engine with a single 3D playing mode. The Windows version was planned for a free Internet release, while Nintendo GameCube and Xbox ports would be reserved for official developers with access to development kits of {{either of the two}} consoles.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{might seem}} {{unlikely}} desert-dwellers, {{because of their}} need to keep their skins moist and their dependence on water for reproductive purposes. In fact, the few species that are found in this habitat have made some remarkable adaptations. Most of them are fossorial, spending the hot dry months aestivating in deep burrows. While there they shed their skins {{a number of times}} and retain the remnants around them as a waterproof cocoon to retain moisture. In the Sonoran Desert, Couch's spadefoot toad spends most of the year dormant in its burrow. Heavy rain is the <b>trigger</b> <b>for</b> emergence and the first male to find a suitable pool calls to attract others. Eggs are laid and the tadpoles grow rapidly as they must reach metamorphosis before the water evaporates. As the desert dries out, the adult toads rebury themselves. The juveniles stay on the surface for a while, feeding and growing, but soon dig themselves burrows. Few make it to adulthood. The water holding frog in Australia has a similar life cycle and may aestivate for as long as five years if no rain falls. The Desert rain frog of Namibia is nocturnal and survives because of the damp sea fogs that roll in from the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the <b>trigger</b> <b>for</b> the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E
5|$|The Peasants' Revolt, {{also called}} Wat Tyler's Rebellion or the Great Rising, {{was a major}} {{uprising}} across large parts of England in 1381. The revolt had various causes, including the socio-economic and political tensions generated by the Black Death in the 1340s, the high taxes resulting from the conflict with France during the Hundred Years' War, and instability within the local leadership of London. The final <b>trigger</b> <b>for</b> the revolt was the intervention of a royal official, John Bampton, in Essex on 30 May 1381. His attempts to collect unpaid poll taxes in Brentwood ended in a violent confrontation, which rapidly spread across the south-east of the country. A wide spectrum of rural society, including many local artisans and village officials, rose up in protest, burning court records and opening the local gaols. The rebels sought a reduction in taxation, {{an end to the}} system of unfree labour known as serfdom and the removal of the King's senior officials and law courts.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual {{maturity}} at 4years {{of age in}} the wild and at 3years in captivity. The species usually reproduces once a year between the months of January and July (the dry season). Copulation between pairs seems to be closely related to food transfers, with this possibly serving as a <b>trigger</b> <b>for</b> intercourse. Amazons have a copulation pattern similar to that found in other parrots throughout the Americas, with the male gripping a perch with one leg while passively placing the other in the female's back. As the time for egg-laying approaches the pair spends more time in the nest, with the male providing food to the female via regurgitation. The female lays 2–4eggs that she exclusively incubates for a period of 24 to 28 days, while the male will be present {{in the vicinity of the}} nest when providing food. Females only leave the nest on rare occasions involving repelling predators or if the male has not brought food in an extended time frame. The chicks are fed by both parents until they leave the nest, usually 60 to 65days after they hatch. Nonetheless, they remain dependent on their parents and travel with them until the next breeding season.|$|E

5|$|The {{first stage}} of a {{thunderstorm}} is the cumulus stage or developing stage. During this stage, masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere. The <b>trigger</b> <b>for</b> this lift can be solar illumination, where the heating of the ground produces thermals, or where two winds converge forcing air upwards, or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation. The moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude, which appear as cumulus clouds. As the water vapor condenses into liquid, latent heat is released, which warms the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding, drier air. The air tends to rise in an updraft {{through the process of}} convection (hence the term convective precipitation). This process creates a low-pressure zone within and beneath the forming thunderstorm. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 500 million kilograms of water vapor are lifted into the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Æthelberht was {{succeeded in}} Kent {{by his son}} Eadbald. Bede states that after Æthelberht's death Eadbald refused to be baptised and married his stepmother, an act {{forbidden}} by {{the teachings of the}} Roman Church. Although Bede's account makes Laurence's miraculous flogging the <b>trigger</b> <b>for</b> Eadbald's baptism, this completely ignores the political and diplomatic problems facing Eadbald. There are also chronological problems with Bede's narrative, as surviving papal letters contradict Bede's account. Historians differ on the exact date of Eadbald's conversion. D. P. Kirby argues that papal letters imply that Eadbald was converted during the time that Justus was Archbishop of Canterbury, which was after Laurence's death, and long after the death of Æthelberht. Henry Mayr-Harting accepts the Bedan chronology as correct, and feels that Eadbald was baptised soon after his father's death. Higham agrees with Kirby that Eadbald did not convert immediately, contending that the king supported Christianity but did not convert for at least eight years after his father's death.|$|E
