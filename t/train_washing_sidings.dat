5000|$|Babylon station {{originally}} opened as a South Side Railroad of Long Island depot on October 28, 1867. It {{was briefly}} renamed Seaside {{station in the}} summer of 1868, but resumed its original name of Babylon station in 1869. The Central Railroad of Long Island had once planned an extension to the Great South Bay and Fire Island which was never built, and a horse car and later trolley line was provided by the Babylon Rail Road company as a substitute. The CRRLI abandoned their own depot in 1874, and began to share it with SSRLI. From that point on the original SSRLI depot contained the name [...] "Babylon & Fire Island" [...] posted on one side. The second depot opened on July 2, 1881, and contained three tracks with two low-level side platforms and two high island platforms, as well as a pedestrian bridge and a REA Express freight house. Electrification came to the station in May 1925, and the station became the terminus of the newly established Babylon Branch. It was razed in 1963 as part of the grade elimination project that was taking place along the entire Babylon Branch during the post-war era. The new elevated third station opened on September 9, 1964. East of the station, a <b>train</b> <b>washing</b> canopy existed in West Islip until 2005. In June 2010, the Long Island Rail Road broke ground on a new environmentally friendly <b>train</b> <b>wash</b> canopy, since Ronkonkoma station had the only <b>train</b> <b>wash</b> on the east end. This new <b>train</b> <b>wash</b> is able to recycle water already used using filters and is capable of washing up to 180 electric multiple unit cars a day (equivalent to 15 twelve-car trains, 18 ten-car trains, about 22 eight-car trains, or 30 six-car trains.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} chosen {{being close to}} Virgin CrossCountry's Birmingham hub {{as well as being}} {{relatively}} close to Derby and Crewe. The depots facilities include inspection and working pits, hoisting facilities, <b>train</b> <b>washing</b> and refuelling is designed for a planned turnaround of up to 20 serviced trains per night.|$|R
50|$|Two {{years after}} the line opened, two goods sidings, {{situated}} between Koo Wee Rup and Bayles, were provided: Plowrights siding and Water Washed Sand siding. Narrow-gauge tramlines ran from both sidings to the main Koo Wee Rup drain, and were used for transporting river-washed sand to the main line. Both Plowrights and Water <b>Washed</b> Sand <b>sidings</b> closed in 1931.|$|R
50|$|The {{suburban}} train depot was opened in 1990. The depot was {{built as a}} replacement of the Jolimont Workshops, in central Melbourne. The depot covers 10.8 hectares, and can accommodate 31 trains, with the facility including a main workshop building, four elevated tracks, two lifting tracks, and a <b>train</b> <b>wash.</b>|$|R
50|$|The depot {{opened in}} 1994, housing a 6-track 400 m shed used for light {{servicing}} and cleaning trains, a 4-track 200 m shed used for heavy overhaul {{and other facilities}} including a wheel lathe shed, a bogie repair shed, <b>train</b> <b>washing</b> and toilet and water changing facilities and a staff accommodation building.|$|R

50|$|The basic {{layout of}} the depot has changed very little {{throughout}} its history. In 2002, there was a <b>train</b> <b>washing</b> line immediately {{to the west of}} the service lines, followed by fifteen open-air sidings for stabling trains. To the west of those was a 9-road shed for stabling, and a couple of sidings near the administration block. Four of the carriage shed lines were only accessible from the northern end, while the western-most five were through roads, which converged to run through a 3-road cleaning shed, further to the south. A second <b>train</b> <b>washing</b> machine was located to the south of that on one of the exit roads. The 1938 Ordnance Survey map shows the carriage shed, with the tracks at the northern end, and some of the stabling sidings next to the carriage shed. The structure of the cleaning shed is shown, but no tracks are connected to it.|$|R
50|$|The station {{buildings}} were demolished following closure {{and the site}} is now the car park of a TK Maxx warehouse store. Where the engine sheds stood is now a <b>train</b> <b>washing</b> facility which was built in 1958; TK Maxx and a row of houses now stand were the coal yard and freight sheds once stood. The remains of both platforms can also still be seen.|$|R
50|$|Fitzpatrick {{contractors}} Ltd. {{was given}} a £11million contact to build a four road train shed for the Class 319 EMUs, which {{in addition to the}} construction of the main train service and maintenance building included stabling for 22 four car <b>trains,</b> a <b>train</b> <b>wash,</b> and controlled emission toilet servicing. The main building was 120 by 25 m. The depot opened 3 November 2004. The initial allocation was 43 Class 319s.|$|R
50|$|An {{automated}} <b>train</b> <b>washing</b> machine washes half of Caltrain's fleet {{each day}} {{or at least}} twice a week, up from twice a year before the facility. The machine can clean a five-car train in about 25 minutes using water from two 35000 gal cisterns. 80% of the water used in the cleaning process is reused to <b>wash</b> another <b>train.</b> The washer is located to the northwest of the maintenance shop.|$|R
50|$|Goods trains {{also use}} the Exhibition line to access the Normanby {{marshalling}} yard and to travel across Brisbane while avoiding city stations and congestion between Bowen Hills and Roma Street stations. QR Traveltrain long-distance passenger services similarly use the Exhibition line to arrive at and depart from Roma Street station. Empty City network and Traveltrain sets {{also use the}} line to access the Normanby <b>train</b> <b>washing</b> facility and the Mayne locomotive and electric depot.|$|R
50|$|The {{proposed}} development required bridge {{widening of}} the crossing of Turnpike lane, and additional embankment work and extensions. The main maintenance building was a six-road 40 by 280 m, 13.4 m high single-ended train shed, with an adjacent <b>train</b> <b>wash</b> (west) and a two-storey 12 by 117 m warehouse {{adjacent to the}} east. The southern site included sidings for 11 twelve-car trains and 2 eight-car trains, with cleaning and controlled emission toilet facilities.|$|R
50|$|The depot {{features}} nine roads {{under the}} main shed (numbered 1-9), five outdoor roads (numbered 11-15), {{two of which}} (11 and 12) are elevated, a <b>train</b> <b>washing</b> facility (16 road) and several short outdoor storage sidings. The depot {{is responsible for the}} stabling and maintenance of all trains on the Northern, North Shore, and Western lines (collectively known as Sector 3). Some Sydney Trains K sets, as well as an allocation of T sets are maintained at Hornsby.|$|R
50|$|The {{plans were}} {{subsequently}} modified in further applications submitted between 2011 and 2013. The 2012 plans removed the separate power car maintenance shed, removed some cleaning facilities, {{and reduced the}} siding layout to a capacity of 20 five car (half train) sets due to changes in expected train timetabling, reducing the site's overall area. The 2013 plans re-instated a bio-cleaning pit, extended the <b>train</b> <b>wash,</b> and added an additional mainline track connection south of the main maintenance shed.|$|R
5000|$|The depot {{features}} nine roads {{under the}} main shed (numbered 1-3 and 5-10), two elevated outdoor roads (numbered 11 and 12), a <b>train</b> <b>washing</b> facility and several short outdoor storage sidings. The depot {{is responsible for}} the stabling and maintenance of all the Tangara trains on the Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line and South Coast Line local services. The 'Sydney Growth Trains" [...] - {{a modified version of the}} Waratah trains - will be based at the depot.|$|R

50|$|The depot {{opened in}} 1927 {{and was one}} of four {{electric}} train depots built under the Bradfield electrification plan, the other depots being at Mortdale, Hornsby and Punchbowl. The depot features 20 storage roads, 10 of which are under the main shed, a lift shop, wheel lathe and a <b>train</b> <b>washing</b> facility. The depot is responsible for the stabling and maintenance of all C sets, most K sets, as well as the remaining S sets. It also maintains the NSW TrainLink V sets.|$|R
50|$|The {{facility}} includes 6 kilometres of sidings and a 7,650 {{square metre}} depot building consisting of office facilities {{and the main}} workshop where servicing of the 57 electric trains takes place. The workshop has seven maintenance berths and has overhead gantry cranes and jacking systems for lifting the trains, high-level platforms to access train roofs, under-floor pits and a wheel lathe. There are an automatic <b>train</b> <b>wash</b> and covered platforms to facilitate cleaning of {{the inside of the}} trains. The facility has been future proofed to maintain a fleet of up to 109 electric trains.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rolling stock}} is cleaned daily in an {{automated}} washing plant utilizing eco-friendly technology. The washing plant {{lies on the}} track leading into the depot, {{and can be used}} by all trains entering or exiting the depot. The plant pre-wets the coaches and then adds the water-based detergent. The entire <b>train</b> is <b>washed</b> in one pass. At the final stage of the plant, reverse osmosis removes stains on glass and the smell left after washing. According to an MMOPL official, [...] "The only action the Metro pilot will have to take is slow the train down to under 5 kmph while in the passage of the plant. Any train that {{does not need to be}} washed will pass the automated wash plant without any hindrance by moving at a speed of more than 5 kmph. A panel displays all data like the number of <b>trains</b> <b>washed,</b> the process a train is going through, the water and the chemical indicator. The trains can be cleaned in less than three minutes with just 600 litres of water, of which 80% is recyclable." [...] Manual high-pressure washing would require 3 hours and 3,000 litres of water.|$|R

50|$|Within {{the main}} office {{building}} is located Selhurst traincrew depot, where many drivers and conductors are based. The depot has extensive stabling sidings, the three main groups of which are known as: Chalk, AC (which were so named because that was where the trains of the former AC system were stabled) and North. There is a large maintenance shed, an AC test rig (for dual voltage units equipped with pantographs), a <b>train</b> <b>wash</b> plant, and a cleaning shed. At the north east corner of the site near to Norwood junction station is the smaller Norwood drivers' depot, and beside it the diesel fuelling point. Selhurst is unusual in that the maximum speed within the depot is 15 mph rather than the usual 5 mph, and signalled train movements are permissive.|$|R
50|$|In the {{immediate}} vicinity of the station, north of the through tracks, there is a maintenance centre for passenger <b>trains,</b> including a <b>washing</b> facility.|$|R
50|$|In mid 2011 Hitachi Rail Europe {{began the}} formal {{application}} process with South Gloucestershire Council {{for the construction}} of a rail depot at the 'Stoke Gifford Triangle'. In September 2011 a planning application was submitted; as specified, the depot was designed for a maximum train length of around 270 m (10 car, 26m carriage trains) with stabling for 17 trains.

Hospital cleaning activities represent a poorly studied sector although very important also for patient's health. We applied the Method of Organizational Congruencies to study cleaning work in three typical hospital units (Emergency Room, Haematology, General Medicine) of a roman University hospital where 198 women cleaners work. We analyzed the 731 technical actions performed in the three shifts and the related Organizational Constraints (OC). Working outsourcing, no occupational risks <b>training,</b> <b>washing</b> personal equipment at home, standing, long walking, early morning and night shift in emergency room, high monotony (> 10 actions per hour) contact with biological and chemicals materials, risk conditions of accidents, artificial lights, hot microclimate and working in a cure setting represent the main Organizational Constraints.
