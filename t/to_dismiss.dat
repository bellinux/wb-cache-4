Fearing that Whitlam {{would go to}} the Queen and {{potentially}} have him removed, the Governor-General gave Whitlam no prior hint.

5|$|The passion {{she showed}} for Abigail, and the {{stubborn}} refusal <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> her, angered Sarah {{to the point}} that she implied that a lesbian affair was taking place between the two women. During the mourning period for Anne's husband, Sarah {{was the only one who}} refused to wear suitable mourning clothes. This gave the impression that she did not consider Anne's grief over his death to be genuine. Eventually, because of the mass support for peace in the War of the Spanish Succession, Anne decided she no longer needed the Duke of Marlborough and took the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> him on trumped-up charges of embezzlement.|$|E

5|$|After {{a number}} of failed marriages {{throughout}} the 40s, she {{spent much of the}} remainder of her life at the court of her brother Herod Agrippa II, amidst rumors the two were carrying on an incestuous relationship. During the First Jewish-Roman War, she began a love affair with the future emperor Titus Flavius Vespasianus. However, her unpopularity among the Romans compelled Titus <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> her on his accession as emperor in 79.

5|$|As ADC, Abu Nuwar {{was a major}} {{influence}} over then-20 year old Hussein and was constantly at his side, advising Hussein <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> Glubb and sever ties with the British. Hussein was also influenced by other Arab nationalist officers and personalities, including his cousin Zaid ibn Shaker, and the increasingly anti-imperialist and Arab nationalist political atmosphere in the country. As a sign of his increasing nationalism and {{as a means to}} quiet political opposition to his rule, Hussein decided <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> Glubb. He coordinated with Abu Nuwar and other Free Officers to ensure that his impending dismissal of Glubb would not result in a revolt by the latter's supporters within the Arab Legion. Thus, on 28 February 1956, Abu Nuwar was instructed to ready his troops, and he subsequently posted Free Officers at the Amman Airport, the major army base at Zarqa and in the vicinity of Glubb Pasha's Amman residence. After Abu Nuwar's positions were confirmed to him, Hussein conferred with his cabinet and dismissed Glubb on 1 March. Glubb complied with the order and departed Jordan the following day. Hussein then promoted Abu Nuwar to major-colonel and appointed Major General Radi Annab to Glubb's former position as {{chief of staff of the}} Arab Legion, which was concurrently renamed the Jordanian Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|At some point, Cybi and Caffo parted company, {{possibly}} {{because of a}} disagreement between them, but {{possibly because}} his brother Gildas had insulted Maelgwn, who then forced Cybi <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> Caffo – both versions appear in the manuscript accounts. Thereafter, Caffo moved towards the south of Anglesey, where {{he was killed by}} shepherds from the area now called Newborough, perhaps avenging the insult on their king.|$|E

50|$|The Court {{accordingly}} held that, {{because it}} was unanimous that the rates levied by the second respondent were lawful, the attack made on them by the appellants had <b>to</b> be <b>dismissed.</b> As the Court was evenly divided on the lawfulness of the contributions levied by the first respondent on {{the second and third}} respondents, the appeal on those issues was not successful and had <b>to</b> be <b>dismissed.</b> In the result, the appeal as a whole had <b>to</b> be <b>dismissed.</b>|$|R
5|$|At the 13 February 1971 election, Askin's {{majority}} {{was reduced}} by four seats to the Labor Party under Pat Hills. Morton retained his seat, despite {{a significant reduction}} in his majority to 62.68%. Morton stayed in office for another year when, on 16 June 1972 he retired from politics. At the time of his departure it had been rumoured that he had been threatening <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> Blacktown City Council if they did not stop blocking a $200 million development in Mount Druitt.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, there was common resentment against the reactionary attitudes {{prevailing}} in Court circles {{even before the}} uproar sparked by the notorious banquet precipitated the political aspects of the march. Deeper planners in the crowd spread the word that the king needed <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> his royal bodyguards entirely and replace them all with patriotic National Guardsmen, a line of argument that had a compelling resonance among Lafayette's soldiers.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1961, {{differences}} in monetary policy led to open conflict with Bank of Canada Governor Coyne, who adhered to a tight money policy. Appointed by St. Laurent to a term expiring in December 1961, Coyne {{could only be}} dismissed before then by the passing of an Act of Parliament. Coyne defended his position by giving public speeches, {{to the dismay of}} the government. The Cabinet was also angered when it learned that Coyne and his board had passed amendments to the bank's pension scheme which greatly increased Coyne's pension, without publishing the amendments in the Canada Gazette as required by law. Negotiations between Minister of Finance Fleming and Coyne for the latter's resignation broke down, with the governor making the dispute public, and Diefenbaker sought <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> Coyne by legislation. Diefenbaker was able to get legislation <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> Coyne through the House, but the Liberal-controlled Senate invited Coyne to testify before one of its committees. After giving the governor a platform against the government, the committee then chose to take no further action, adding its view that Coyne had done nothing wrong. Once he had the opportunity to testify (denied him in the Commons), Coyne resigned, keeping his increased pension, and the government was extensively criticized in the press.|$|E

Older workers, enjoying longer packages of benefits, have significantly lower chances of moving to employment. Differential effects vary with time and are higher when younger workers approach the exhaustion of benefits...|$|R
