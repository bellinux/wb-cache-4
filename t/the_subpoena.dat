5|$|Cook County {{homeowners are}} {{eligible}} for a property-tax break on their primary residence, but a manager in Assessor's office was granted the homeowner's exemption on two homes. In 2012 Cook County Inspector General Blanchard subpoenaed the Assessor's office seeking documents related to the exemptions. Berrios ignored <b>the</b> <b>subpoena,</b> claiming that the County Inspector General has no authority over him. Blanchard filed suit against Berrios. Berrios is represented in the suit by Cook County State's Attorney Alvarez. On January, 15, 2014, a Cook County circuit court judge ruled that the County Inspector General {{had the authority to}} investigate the Assessor and all other independently elected County offices. On August 21, 2014, the judge ruled the Assessor must comply with the Inspector General's subpoena. On December 1, 2016, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Cook County Inspector General has the power to investigate the Cook County Assessor, affirming two lower court decisions.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, a {{high-quality}} {{recording of the}} Las Vegas show was uploaded to YouTube. On July 14, 2011, {{the vice president of}} Online Anti-Piracy from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Marc McDevitt, requested a subpoena at a federal court to obtain personal details from YouTube of the user who uploaded the video, including the IP address, e-mail address and any other relevant information to identify the person. Although it is common for major music labels to send takedown requests to YouTube, it is thought to be the first time the RIAA filed legal action against the video hosting site in order to obtain the personal details of an uploader. The case was closed after a week; according to a copyright lawyer, it is most likely that <b>the</b> <b>subpoena</b> was granted by the court and that YouTube agreed to hand over the personal details that were requested. The video was removed from YouTube, but copies of the full concert can still be found on the site.|$|E
5|$|The maximum fine that Landis could impose was $29,240,000. To aid {{the judge}} in {{determining}} the sentence, Landis issued a subpoena for Rockefeller to testify as to Standard Oil's assets. The tycoon had often evaded subpoenas, not having testified in court since 1888. Deputy United States marshals visited Rockefeller's several homes, {{as well as the}} estates of his friends, in the hope of finding him. After several days, Rockefeller was found at his lawyer's estate, Taconic Farm in northwestern Massachusetts, and was served with <b>the</b> <b>subpoena.</b> The tycoon duly came to Landis's Chicago courtroom, making his way through a mob anxious to see the proceedings. Rockefeller's actual testimony, proffered after the judge made him wait through several cases and witnesses, proved to be anticlimactic, as he professed almost no knowledge of Standard Oil's corporate structure or assets.|$|E
5000|$|On September 16, Colberg {{notified}} the Legislature that state employees would disobey <b>the</b> <b>subpoenas</b> issued in <b>the</b> {{course of the}} investigation, unless either the full Senate or the legislature as a whole voted to compel their testimony. He stated that the officials were [...] "loyal employees subject to {{the supervision of the}} Governor" [...] and cited Governor Palin's decision not to co-operate with the inquiry, her statement that <b>the</b> <b>subpoenas</b> were [...] "of questionable validity," [...] and the pending lawsuits challenging <b>the</b> investigation. <b>The</b> <b>subpoenas</b> were authorized at a joint meeting of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. The Alaska Senate Judiciary Committee, which voted to issue <b>the</b> <b>subpoenas,</b> was composed of three Republicans and two Democrats. The vote was 3-2. The House Judiciary Committee also voted, in an advisory capacity, in favor of authorizing <b>the</b> <b>subpoenas.</b> This vote was 5-0. Those five included three Republicans and two Democrats.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2010 Corbett filed a {{criminal}} subpoena against Twitter ordering them to divulge [...] "any and all subscriber information" [...] of the person(s) behind two accounts that were criticizing the Republican candidate.

5000|$|On May 28, 2014, the Houston City Council {{passed the}} Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) which was {{authored}} by Parker, {{by a vote}} of 11 to 6. Mayor Parker had certified that [...] "there exists a public emergency requiring that this Ordinance be passed finally on the date of its introduction". On July 3, 2014, opponents of the ordinance submitted 50,000 signatures to the city to force the ordinance to a vote of the public. [...] The city announced that the opponents were 2,022 signatures short of the 17,269 needed to put the matter to a vote. (For a more complete discussion of the HERO referendum, see Houston, Texas Proposition 1, 2015.) HERO opponents filed a lawsuit against Mayor Parker and the city on August 5, 2014. In response, city attorneys defending <b>the</b> law filed <b>subpoenas</b> for sermons from local Christian pastors. [...] Attorneys for the pastors called <b>the</b> <b>subpoenas</b> retaliation against Christians for opposing the ordinance. Parker maintained that the attorneys who dealt with the lawsuit for the city were outside lawyers (i.e., not city employees) and that she and City Attorney David Feldman had been unaware of <b>the</b> <b>subpoenas.</b> After what some news organizations called a [...] "firestorm" [...] of criticism over <b>the</b> <b>subpoenas</b> (Parker said that she had been [...] "vilified coast to coast"), Parker directed the city's attorneys on October 29, 2014 to withdraw <b>the</b> <b>subpoenas.</b> After <b>the</b> <b>subpoenas</b> were withdrawn, local city pastors filed a civil rights lawsuit against Parker.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>subpoena</b> duces tecum {{is similar}} to <b>the</b> <b>subpoena</b> ad testificandum, which is a writ {{summoning}} a witness to testify orally. However, unlike the latter summons, <b>the</b> <b>subpoena</b> duces tecum instructs the witness to bring in hand books, papers, or evidence for the court. In most jurisdictions, a subpoena usually has to be served personally.|$|E

5000|$|According to Branchflower, Wilkes {{may have}} lied to him during an earlier interview, {{and may have}} had a {{financial}} incentive to cover up being pressured by the Palins to deny Wooten's worker's compensation claim. Branchflower said an employee at Wilkes' company had called a tip line and said [...] "the governor's office wanted this claim denied." [...] According to KTUU, [...] "knowingly denying a worker's comp claim for false reasons is a criminal offense." [...] Sarah Palin herself was not subpoenaed: Ramras said that it [...] "would be disrespectful" [...] for <b>the</b> committee to <b>subpoena</b> <b>the</b> governor while she was running for Vice President. The Alaska Senate Judiciary Committee, which voted to issue <b>the</b> <b>subpoenas,</b> is composed of three Republicans and two Democrats.

Wisniewski said <b>the</b> <b>subpoena</b> was perfectly sound, and that Schar would review the attorney's objections and consider the committee's legal options.

On August 20, 2007, Fielding wrote to Leahy that the White House needed yet more time to respond to <b>the</b> <b>subpoenas,</b> which prompted Leahy to reply that the Senate may consider a contempt of Congress citation when it returns from its August recess.|$|R

25|$|The judge {{suggested}} that the committee could consider reissuing subpoenas with more limited document requests that could be acceptable.
