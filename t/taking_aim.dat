5|$|Once at war, Turkey joined Germany in <b>taking</b> <b>aim</b> at the {{opposing}} Entente Powers and their extensive empires in the Muslim world. Enver Pasha had the Sultan proclaim jihad. His hope was to provoke and aid a vast Muslim revolution, particularly in India. Translations of the proclamation {{were sent to}} Berlin for propaganda purposes, for distribution to Muslim troops of the Entente Powers. However, while widely heard, the proclamation {{did not have the}} intended effect of mobilising global Muslim opinion on behalf of Turkey or the Central Powers.|$|E

50|$|Heavy and {{continuous}} suppressive fire keeps an opponent in a defensive posture (hunkered in their foxholes instead of <b>taking</b> <b>aimed</b> shots) and therefore limits the enemy's overall firepower. Suppressive fire also prevents the enemy from properly assessing {{the attack and}} organizing a coherent and coordinated defense or counter-attack.|$|R

25|$|Wang {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{computer}} companies to advertise on television, and the first to run an ad during the Super Bowl in 1978. Their first ad literally cast Wang Laboratories as David and IBM as Goliath, several years before the famous 1984 Apple Computer ad. A later ad depicted Wang Laboratories as a helicopter gunship <b>taking</b> <b>aim</b> at IBM.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, DDoS botnets such as DD4BC grew in prominence, <b>taking</b> <b>aim</b> at {{financial}} institutions. Cyber-extortionists typically {{begin with}} a low-level attack and a warning that a larger attack {{will be carried out}} if a ransom is not paid in Bitcoin. Security experts recommend targeted websites to not pay the ransom. The attackers tend to get into an extended extortion scheme once they recognize that the target is ready to pay.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the initial}} assault, the Ottoman {{defenders}} {{continued to hold}} very strong defensive positions, with each redoubt ideally placed to provide supporting fire for others. In most places the dismounted attackers were badly exposed to this fire. A constant stream of fire was maintained on the Ottoman parapets to suppress the defenders and prevent them from <b>taking</b> <b>aim</b> while the attack continued. Little by little the cordon drew tighter under intense fire over the bare, gently-sloping grasslands. However, between about 12:15 and 14:15 progress slowed.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, Burr {{was unsure}} of Hamilton's {{intentions}} (as historians still are today). Seeing Hamilton fire {{into the brush}} above his head, Burr {{could not be sure}} if Hamilton had thrown away his shot or simply missed his target. According to the principles of the code duello, Burr was entirely justified in <b>taking</b> <b>aim</b> at Hamilton, under the hypothesis that Hamilton had shot first. Continuing this line of reasoning, {{it is not clear that}} Burr did more than react to hearing Hamilton fire before he had any time to realize where the shot had gone.|$|E
25|$|On 7 August, Ken McGonigle, aged 50, {{a former}} member of the RUC, saved the life of one of the most senior US {{officers}} in Afghanistan when he was killed. He was working in Musa Qal’eh, Helmand province with private security company New Century, when he exchanged fire with two escaped Taliban prisoners who were <b>taking</b> <b>aim</b> with a grenade launcher at a US special forces helicopter leaving a base. The 50-year-old Co Londonderry father of four was shot dead and two US Marines were subsequently killed in the fight. But the MV-22B Osprey aircraft, which can operate as both a helicopter and a turbo-prop aeroplane, escaped. It later emerged that vice admiral Robert Harward, a three-star US Navy SEAL who has been nominated to take over as deputy commander of US forces in Afghanistan, was in the aircraft. His actions later merited the award of the Queens Gallantry Medal.|$|E
25|$|Bourque then {{fled the}} woods and emerged {{southeast}} of McCoy Street, where he continued walking {{in a straight line}} on Mailhot Avenue. There, two minutes after he shot Gevaudan, he encountered Cst. David Ross, who was driving a police sports utility vehicle down the road. Ross drew his service pistol and accelerated his vehicle towards Bourque as he was turning to face his direction. Ross fired two shots at Bourque through his windshield, while Bourque fired six shots back at him. Ross was shot twice in the hand and left shoulder, with a third fatal shot being directed at the head. It was believed he was attempting to hit Bourque with his vehicle or get within range to open fire with his service weapon.Cst. Eric White later found Ross's body still slumped inside the driver's seat before being forced to take cover behind the vehicle after spotting Bourque <b>taking</b> <b>aim</b> at him from further down the street.|$|E

500|$|On 11 December 1944, Reid was {{operating}} with a convoy bound for Ormoc Bay, Leyte, to resupply land forces. [...] Late that afternoon, {{a group of}} Japanese planes descended on the convoy and penetrated the defenses, <b>taking</b> <b>aim</b> at Reid and another destroyer. [...] The destroyers put up an anti-aircraft barrage that splashed some of the planes and damaged others, but Reid was hit by five suicide planes, causing powerful explosions. Within minutes, {{she went to the}} bottom, and over a hundred men perished. [...] Reid received seven battle stars for her World War II service.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the book for The American Scholar, Siva Vaidhyanathan of New York University wrote that MacLeod [...] "...delivers a lively, {{personal}} account of the ways intellectual property messes with people—and how he messes with intellectual property", and that, [...] "McLeod is ironic and witty, writing with a hip-hop-influenced youth-savvy diction that demonstrates his confidence and engagement with the material and the culture that means so much to him." [...] Davis Schneiderman wrote positively of the work in a review for American Book Review, comparing it to similar works on the subject matter, including No Logo: <b>Taking</b> <b>Aim</b> at the Brand Bullies (2000) by Naomi Klein, and writings of Michael Moore and Al Franken.|$|E
500|$|From their {{advantageous}} height by Königgrätz, the Austrians frequently bombarded the Prussian army encamped below them. On {{the same}} day that Frederick's doctors bled him, an Austrian cannonade grew so strong that Frederick rode out to observe the damage. During the ride, his vein opened. A company medic bound his wound, an incident later depicted by the painter Bernhard Rode. In his admiring history of Frederick the Great, the English historian Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) relayed the story of Frederick and a Croatian marksman. As Frederick was reconnoitering, Carlyle maintained, the King encountered the Croat <b>taking</b> <b>aim</b> at him. Reportedly, he wagged his finger at the man, as if to say, [...] "Do not do that." [...] The Croat thought better of shooting the King, and disappeared into the woods; some reports maintain he actually knelt before the king and kissed his hand.|$|E
60|$|To {{have waited}} longer {{would have been}} foolish, and <b>taking</b> careful <b>aim,</b> Snap fired his shotgun twice. Scarcely had the two reports rung out than Giant also fired, followed, a few seconds later, by the doctor's son.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the promised}} time, WQNC flipped back to Urban as [...] "92.7 The Block", <b>taking</b> direct <b>aim</b> at WPEG (as well as WGIV/W277CB). The first song on [...] "The Block" [...] was [...] "Tha Block Is Hot" [...] by Lil Wayne.|$|R
500|$|What's the Story was {{released}} to lukewarm reviews {{from the mainstream}} music press. Many contemporary reviewers expressed disappointment at the album's perceived inferiority to Definitely Maybe, <b>taking</b> <b>aim</b> at the 'banal lyrics' and the unoriginal nature of the compositions. David Cavanagh of Q magazine said of the lyrics [...] "They scan; they fill a hole; end of story. They [...] nothing much about anything." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent commented that [...] "She's Electric" [...] is laddism of a tiresomely generic kind [...] "Roll With It" [...] is drab and chummy." [...] Perhaps the most damning review came from David Stubbs of the now-defunct Melody Maker. Despite stating that [...] "Some Might Say" [...] was [...] "the best single of the year", Stubbs went on {{to be critical of}} the album as a whole; [...] "What's the Story [...] laboured and lazy. On this evidence, Oasis are a limited band... they sound knackered." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Ginsburg co-founded the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and, in 1973, {{she became}} the ACLU's general counsel. The Women's Rights Project and related ACLU {{projects}} participated in over three hundred gender discrimination cases by 1974. As {{the director of the}} ACLU's Women's Rights Project, she argued six gender discrimination cases before the Supreme Court between 1973 and 1976, winning five. Rather than asking the Court to end all gender discrimination at once, Ginsburg charted a strategic course, <b>taking</b> <b>aim</b> at specific discriminatory statutes and building on each successive victory. She chose plaintiffs carefully, at times picking male plaintiffs to demonstrate that gender discrimination was harmful to both men and women The laws Ginsburg targeted included those that on the surface appeared beneficial to women, but in fact reinforced the notion that women needed to be dependent on men. Her strategic advocacy extended to word choice, favoring the use of [...] "gender" [...] instead of [...] "sex", after her secretary suggested the word [...] "sex" [...] would serve as a distraction to judges. She attained a reputation as a skilled oral advocate and her work led directly to the end of gender discrimination {{in many areas of the}} law.|$|E
500|$|On July 5, 2005, {{recording}} for Straight Outta Lynwood officially {{began at}} Santa Monica Sound Records, in Santa Monica, California. By late 2005, six originals—"Pancreas", [...] "Close but No Cigar", [...] "Virus Alert", [...] "Don't Download This Song", [...] "I'll Sue Ya", and [...] "Weasel Stomping Day"—had been recorded. [...] "Weasel Stomping Day" [...] describes, {{in the style}} of animated musical specials of the 1960s, a supposedly traditional holiday in which participants don Viking helmets, spread mayonnaise on their lawns, and [...] "snap [...] weasely spines in half." [...] "I'll Sue Ya" [...] is a Rage Against the Machine style parody, <b>taking</b> <b>aim</b> at the abundance of frivolous lawsuits in the United States. Yankovic chose to juxtapose the style of Rage Against the Machine with lyrics about lawsuits because he felt that humor could be derived by pairing the anger of the band's music with a topic so vacuous. [...] "Don't Download This Song", a style parody of 1980s charity songs, such as [...] "We are the World", [...] "Hands Across America", and [...] "Do They Know It’s Christmas?", [...] "describes the perils of online music file-sharing". According to Yankovic himself, the song takes a moderate approach to the peer-to-peer music download situation, arguing that both sides—people trying to illegally download music and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)—can act hypocritically depending on the situation.|$|E

500|$|While {{he enjoyed}} {{enthusiastic}} {{support from the}} conservative movement, Goldwater was opposed by liberals and moderates in the party, particularly New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, who was also speculated to run for president. He cast Goldwater as an opponent of civil rights and an isolationist who wanted {{to withdraw from the}} United Nations. He vowed to stop Goldwater from running, [...] "at all costs". There were concerns that Goldwater and the more moderate Rockefeller could divide the Republican party, harming the its chances of winning the general election. Goldwater was the perceived leader of a grassroots movement in the American southern, southwestern, and western states staged by the more conservative wing of the party. Rockefeller, on the other hand, disagreed with most of the fiscal and social positions held by Goldwater, advocating a more progressive, mainstream approach to government for the Republican platform. News of Rockefeller's marriage in May 1963, eighteen months after he divorced his first wife, to a woman with whom he'd had a relationship for over five years spread quickly throughout the nation. Initially, Rockefeller's divorce received little media fanfare; however, news of his remarriage prompted a considerably negative reaction among many. Rockefeller, who had been leading in the polls over other Republican candidates by a comfortable margin just weeks previously, saw a significant decrease in support for his candidacy. In July 1963, he made an attempt to regain lost support by <b>taking</b> <b>aim</b> at what he viewed as [...] "extremist groups," [...] targeting Goldwater specifically. Goldwater responded by accusing Rockefeller of blurring the line separating the Republican and Democratic parties. In attacking Goldwater's politics and advocating his own, more progressive agenda, Rockefeller said to voters [...] "Americans will not and should not respond to a political creed that cherishes the past solely because it offers an excuse for shutting out the hard facts and difficult tasks of the present." ...|$|E
