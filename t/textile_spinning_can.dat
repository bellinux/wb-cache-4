25|$|In chemistry, a soap is a salt of a fatty acid. Household {{uses for}} soaps include washing, bathing, {{and other types}} of housekeeping, where soaps act as surfactants, {{emulsifying}} oils to enable them to be carried away by water. In industry they are also used in <b>textile</b> <b>spinning</b> and are important components of some lubricants. Metal soaps are also included in modern artists' oil paints formulations as a rheology modifier.|$|R
50|$|Since 1793, when Samuel Slater {{established}} the first water-powered successful <b>textile</b> <b>spinning</b> mill in America at Pawtucket, Rhode Island, water power had been operating machinery to process cotton fiber into yarn, {{which would then}} be outsourced to small weaving shops and private homes {{where it would be}} woven into cloth on hand-operated looms. By 1810, dozens of spinning mills dotted the New England countryside. However, cloth production was still fairly slow with this system.|$|R

The application of statistics to analyze is there any difference in mean number of yarn count differences due to shift and machine number. So, two ways ANOVA may be useful to do this analysis. In this paper count variations (yarn produced by different ring frames and different shifts) are analyzed by two factorial ANOVA.
