5|$|Field Grade {{officers}}, and Company Grade officers commonly wore <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> seven {{equally spaced}} buttons each, despite regulations {{calling for the}} top two buttons to be spaced at four inches apart, coming closer together at the waist at 3inches in distance.|$|E
5|$|In the Confederate Artillery, {{a normal}} junior officer had <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> seven evenly spaced buttons, grouped into pairs, while a senior officer could {{have as many}} as eight buttons in two rows.|$|E
5|$|Ellen Biddle Shipman {{designed}} the Italian Garden in May 1931. It features <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> clipped evergreens between two long, rectangular reflecting pools. It has {{a focal point}} {{at the end of}} the garden in the form of a marble fountain surrounded by an arched gloriette. There are also a number of statues, ornaments, tubs of small trees, and flowers.|$|E

50|$|The female Typhochlaena seladonia has long, thin spermathecae, {{which are}} spiralled distally. The male {{has a very}} long embolus. Additionally, both genders have a greenish {{cephalothorax}} and a black dorsum with <b>two</b> <b>row</b> <b>of</b> six spots, the posterior pair being reddish and all others being yellowish.|$|R
2500|$|Their [...] "molars" [...] have <b>two</b> {{parallel}} <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> tubercles, {{unlike the}} tribosphenic (three-peaked) molars of uncontested early crown mammals.|$|R
5|$|Most {{species in}} this order have five arms and <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> tube feet with suckers. There are {{conspicuous}} marginal plates {{on the arms}} and disc. Some species have paxillae and in some, the main pedicellariae are clamp-like and recessed into the skeletal plates. This group includes the cushion stars, the leather star and the sea daisies.|$|E
5|$|On {{the upright}} collar of full generals, {{lieutenant}} generals, major generals, and brigadier generals three stars were stitched within a wreath, all embroidered in gold coloring. The center star was {{slightly larger than}} the other stars. It {{was not possible to}} know which grade of general an officer was by his collar insignia. However, major generals and lieutenant generals wore <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> nine buttons in groups of three down the front of the overcoat, and brigadier generals wore <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> eight buttons in groups of two. However, Confederate Army Regulations had no distinction between the general officer grades, and had only the insignia for brigadier generals recognized. At least three general officers did not wear the prescribed uniform: Robert E. Lee, who wore the uniform of a colonel, refusing to wear a general's insignia until the Confederate victory; Joseph L. Hogg, who died of a fever; and Benjamin McCulloch.|$|E
5|$|The church, {{without an}} apse and a transept, {{maintained}} its original single-nave plan {{until at least}} 1627. In 1662 the naves had become three, separated by <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> square brick pillars and surmounted by vaults. The church had five altars in 1627, increasing to six in 1649. In 1726 the closing of its side gate along the Borgo Vecchio made room for another altar.|$|E
50|$|The <b>two</b> {{innermost}} <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> {{the layout}} constitute a diatonic C major scale, distributed alternately {{between the two}} sides of the instrument. Thus in a given range, C-E-G-B-d is on one side, D-F-A-c-e on the other. The <b>two</b> outer <b>rows</b> consist <b>of</b> the sharps and flats required to complete the chromatic scale. This distribution of scale notes between sides facilitates rapid melodic play.|$|R
50|$|Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in cerebrus, but {{the abdomen}} beneath with two lateral and <b>two</b> median <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> black spots.|$|R
50|$|They {{generally}} have eight black equal-sized eyes in <b>two</b> horizontal <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> four each, with posterior median ones {{close to each}} other.|$|R
5|$|The first <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> {{this table}} are straightforward. The {{homotopy}} groups πi(S0) of the 0-dimensional sphere are trivial for i > 0, because any base point preserving map from an i-sphere to a 0-sphere is a one-point mapping. Similarly, the homotopy groups πi(S1) of the 1-sphere are trivial for i > 1, because the universal covering space, R, {{which has the}} same higher homotopy groups, is contractible.|$|E
5|$|The shared {{repetitive}} {{nature of}} the phrasing of the texts, apart from Gv and I, suggests to Pozdniakov {{that they are not}} integral texts, and cannot contain the varied contents which would be expected for history or mythology. In the following table of characters in the Pozdniakov & Pozdniakov inventory, ordered by descending frequency, the first <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> 26 characters account for 86% of the entire corpus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> {{alternating}} plates. By {{the early}} 1960s, this had become (and remains) the prevalent idea, mainly because some S. stenops fossils {{in which the}} plates are still partially articulated show this arrangement. This arrangement is chiral and so demands that a specimen be distinguished from its distinct, hypothetical mirror-image form.|$|E
5000|$|A triple harp {{features}} three <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> parallel strings, <b>two</b> outer <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> diatonic strings, and {{a center}} <b>row</b> <b>of</b> chromatic strings. To play a sharp, the harpist reaches {{in between the}} strings in either outer row and plucks the center row string. Like the double-strung harp, the <b>two</b> outer <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> strings are tuned the same, but the triple-strung harp has no levers. This harp originated in Italy in the 16th century as a low headed instrument, and {{towards the end of}} 17th century it arrived in Wales where it developed a high head and larger size. It established itself as part of Welsh tradition and became known as the Welsh harp (telyn deires, [...] "three-row harp"). The traditional design has all of the strings strung from {{the left side of the}} neck, but modern neck designs have the <b>two</b> outer <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> strings strung from opposite sides of the neck to greatly reduce the tendency for the neck to roll over to the left.|$|R
50|$|Physical Structure: <b>Two</b> {{parallel}} <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> compressed {{scales on}} the head just above tympanum. Has extra flap of skin {{on the side of}} the abdomen.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} {{ceiling of the}} later, 15th-17th century towers was a false vault, known as nartol tkhov, with <b>two</b> intercrossing <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> {{reinforcing}} ribs.|$|R
5|$|Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew {{it lightly}} first to subdue it. They {{typically}} have small hinged pedicellate teeth, a feature unique to amphibians. The base and crown {{of these are}} composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs have one or <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> teeth in both jaws, but some frogs (Rana spp.) lack teeth in the lower jaw, and toads (Bufo spp.) have no teeth. In many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in {{the roof of the}} mouth.|$|E
5|$|As {{the name}} suggests, New Texas Giant is {{located within the}} Texas section of Six Flags Over Texas. It was Rocky Mountain Construction's first {{installation}} of I-Box track. New Texas Giant operates with three trains manufactured by Gerstlauer. The trains are themed to 1961 Cadillac Devilles. Each train {{is made up of}} six cars, each seating riders in <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> two. Riders are restrained through the use of an individual hydraulic lap bar and a seat belt.|$|E
5|$|Converting Campbeltown for {{the raid}} took ten days. She {{had to be}} {{lightened}} to raise her draught {{to get over the}} sand banks in the estuary. This was achieved by completely stripping all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three 4inch (100mm) guns, torpedoes and depth charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun with a light quick–firing 12 pounder (3"). Eight 20mm Oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level. The bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour-plate protection, and <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the Commandos on the open deck.|$|E
50|$|Body {{somewhat}} cylindrical and stout. Head short, and blunt. Dorsum pinkish-brown {{with small}} three <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> brown markings. <b>Two</b> lateral <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> linear marks confluent and usually from stripes. Median <b>row</b> <b>of</b> discontinuous spots ending at vent.|$|R

30|$|Hence, it is {{reasonable}} to regard the <b>two</b> adjacent <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> the data as approximately equal, and this feature provides the theoretical basis for the proposed algorithm.|$|R
5|$|Iron Rattler {{is located}} in the Western-themed Crackaxle Canyon area of Fiesta Texas, sitting next to the Road Runner Express and The Gully Washer. It is Rocky Mountain Construction's second {{installation}} of I-Box track, and the first to feature a barrel roll inversion. Iron Rattler operates with two Rattler-themed trains manufactured by Gerstlauer. Each train is made up of six cars which seat riders in <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> two. Riders are restrained {{through the use of a}} lap bar and a seat belt.|$|E
5|$|Some {{robotics}} {{research is}} exploring biomimicry of octopus features. Octopus arms can move and sense largely autonomously without intervention from the animal's central nervous system. In 2015 {{a team in}} Italy built soft-bodied robots able to crawl and swim, requiring only minimal computation. In 2017 a German company made an arm with a soft pneumatically controlled silicone gripper fitted with <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> suckers. It is able to grasp objects such as a metal tube, a magazine, or a ball, and to fill a glass by pouring water from a bottle.|$|E
5|$|The Swarm is a steel Wing Coaster at Thorpe Park, a {{theme park}} in the United Kingdom. The Swarm was the world's second Wing Coaster {{designed}} by Swiss roller coaster manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard and the United Kingdom's first Wing Coaster. Construction commenced in May 2011, and the coaster opened on 15 March 2012. Starting in 2013, the last <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> each train face backwards, while the first five rows face forward. This was removed in 2016, with all riders facing forward once again.|$|E

5|$|The large throne hall {{stands on}} a 50cm high base, the roof is covered in green and orange tiles. The {{pediment}} is decorated with a mural depicting the Hindu god Indra. The main central door is reserved for use by royalty, while others must enter through the adjacent side doors. Within the hall there are <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> square columns, five {{on the left and}} six on the right, adorned with Thai floral designs. The coffered ceiling is decorated with glass mosaic stars.|$|E
5|$|The most {{noticeable}} {{feature of the}} fort is the circular keep. This was modeled on the reduit de surete of the Lunette d'Arçon, and it also bears similarities to the tour-reduits built in Malta in the early 18th century (the only surviving example is Vendôme Tower). It had <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> musketry loopholes, and its roof contained a parapet with four embrasures. The latter was replaced with a sloping parapet to mount a single gun in the 1860s. The keep also contains the main gate, above which is a commemorative plaque.|$|E
5|$|When Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin was {{announced}} in November 2011, Oceaneering had already developed a working prototype of the ride vehicle. The first concept art for the attraction was released in April 2012: a circular ride vehicle, seating eight riders in <b>two</b> <b>rows</b> <b>of</b> four. On May 11, 2012 Oceaneering filed a patent application for the ride's technology. At the November 2012 IAAPA Attractions Expo, SeaWorld Orlando and Oceaneering International revealed the trackless, motion simulator-based ride vehicle to the public.|$|E
