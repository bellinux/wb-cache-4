25|$|In {{order for}} the race to take place, the Austin city council was asked to be the {{sponsoring}} municipality for the event. Through being a sponsor, the city could apply for money from a state fund, the Major Events Trust Fund (METF), designed to attract major sporting events to Texas {{that would be used}} to pay the Formula One race sanctioning fee. This matter was complicated by opponents of the project who filed a lawsuit against state comptroller Susan Combs, claiming that she had promised the funding to the circuit without having been legally authorized to do so, though promoters have responded stating that all necessary guidelines had been followed. On July 1, 2011, a state district court judge declined to enter a temporary restraining order against Combs preventing payments from the METF; nonetheless, Texas Comptroller Combs reconsidered and chose not to make the July 31 advance payment to FOMC/Bernard Ecclestone as previously agreed for the first year's sanctioning fee. <b>The</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> project's opponents has stated that he is unsure if they will continue pursuing the lawsuit.|$|E

500|$|In 1801, {{the usual}} meeting was delayed, causing Mint Director Elias Boudinot to {{complain}} to President John Adams that depositors were anxious for an audit so the Mint could release coins struck from their bullion. Numismatist Fred Reed {{suggested that the}} delay was probably due to poor weather, {{making it difficult for}} officials to travel from the new capital of Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia for the assay. [...] In response, on March 3, 1801, Congress changed the designation of officials required to attend to [...] "the district judge of Pennsylvania, <b>the</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United States in the district of Pennsylvania, and the commissioner of loans for the State of Pennsylvania". The meeting finally took place on April 27, 1801. [...] The 1806 and 1815 sessions were delayed because of outbreaks of disease in Philadelphia; the one in 1812 was held a month late because of a heavy snowstorm which prevented the commissioners from reaching the Mint. [...] No meeting took place in 1817; a fire had damaged the Philadelphia Mint in January 1816, and no gold or silver awaited the commission. [...] In 1818, Congress substituted the Collector of the Port of Philadelphia for the Pennsylvania loans commissioner {{as a member of the}} Assay Commission. With the Coinage Act of 1834, Congress removed the automatic disqualification of Mint officers in the event of an unfavorable assay, leaving the decision to the president.|$|E

500|$|McLaughlin {{had been}} New York City Police Commissioner in 1926, knew O'Malley's father, and had {{attended}} Philadelphia Athletics games with O'Malley when O'Malley {{was still at}} the University of Pennsylvania. McLaughlin hired O'Malley to administer mortgage foreclosures against failing businesses for the Trust Company. O'Malley earned McLaughlin's confidence by acting in numerous capacities including bodyguard, valet, chauffeur, adopted son, confidant and right-hand man. The trust company owned the estate of Charles Ebbets, {{who had died in}} 1925 and owned half of the Brooklyn Dodgers. It was 1933 when Walter again met George V. McLaughlin, president of the Brooklyn Trust Company. O'Malley was chosen to protect the company's financial interests in the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1933. [...] O'Malley also served as designated driver for the hard drinking McLaughlin. [...] It was through McLaughlin that Walter was brought into the financial arrangements for Ebbets Field in 1940.

In 1943, he replaced Wendell Willkie as chief legal counsel.

Lamberth, [...] "The message directed the Iranian ambassador to contact Hussein Musawi, the leader of the terrorist group Islamic Amal, and to instruct him ...

This drew the attention of critics, who also objected to Moore's practice of opening court sessions with a prayer beseeching Divine Guidance for jurors in their deliberations. In at least one instance, Moore asked a clergyman to lead the court's jury pool in prayer. The local branch of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sent a letter in June 1993 {{with the threat of}} a lawsuit if such prayers did not cease.|$|E
