25|$|In 2002, {{captured}} Al Qaeda leader Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi was rendered to Egypt {{where he}} was allegedly tortured. The information he provided to his interrogators formed a fundamental part of the Bush administration case for attacking Iraq, alleging links between Al Qaeda and Iraq. Al-Libi later recanted his story and it is generally believed that his stories of contact between <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> regime and Al-Qaeda were fabricated to please his interrogators.|$|E

25|$|The Iraqi Islamic Party {{was formed}} in 1960 as the Iraqi branch of the Brotherhood, but was banned from 1961 during the {{nationalist}} rule of Abd al-Karim Qasim. As government repression hardened under the Baath Party from February 1963, the group was forced to continue underground. After the fall of <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> government in 2003, the Islamic Party has reemerged {{as one of the}} main advocates of the country's Sunni community. The Islamic Party has been sharply critical of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, but still participates in the political process nevertheless. Its leader is Iraqi Vice-President Tariq Al-Hashimi.|$|E
500|$|After World War II, the French Committee of National Liberation {{was late}} to be {{recognized}} by the US as the government of France, and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that created the new organization. The future French president Charles de Gaulle criticized the UN, famously calling it a machin ("contraption"), and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help maintain world peace, preferring direct defence treaties between countries. Throughout the Cold War, both the US and USSR repeatedly accused the UN of favouring the other. In 1953, the USSR effectively forced the resignation of Trygve Lie, the Secretary-General, through its refusal to deal with him, while in the 1950s and 1960s, a popular US bumper sticker read, [...] "You can't spell communism without U.N." [...] In a sometimes-misquoted statement, President George W. Bush stated in February 2003 (referring to UN uncertainty towards Iraqi provocations under <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> regime) that [...] "free nations will not allow the UN to fade into history as an ineffective, irrelevant debating society." [...] In contrast, the French President, François Hollande, stated in 2012 that [...] "France trusts the United Nations. She knows that no state, no matter how powerful, can solve urgent problems, fight for development and {{bring an end to}} all crises... France wants the UN to be the centre of global governance." [...] Critics such as Dore Gold, an Israeli diplomat, Robert S. Wistrich, a British scholar, Alan Dershowitz, an American legal scholar, Mark Dreyfus, an Australian politician, and the Anti-Defamation League consider UN attention to Israel's treatment of Palestinians to be excessive. In September 2015, Saudi Arabia's [...] Faisal bin Hassan Trad has been elected Chair of the UN Human Rights Council panel that appoints independent experts, a move criticized by human rights groups.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{analysts believe}} that poor reservoir-management {{practices}} during <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> years may have seriously, and even permanently, damaged Kirkuk's oil field. [...] One example showed an estimated [...] of excess fuel oil being reinjected. Other problems include refinery residue and gas-stripped oil. Fuel oil reinjection has increased oil viscosity at Kirkuk {{making it more difficult}} and expensive to get the oil out of the ground.|$|E
2500|$|In late October 2004, United States {{military}} forces operating in Iraq arrested appellee Shawqi Ahmad Omar, a dual American/Jordanian citizen, at his Baghdad home. Born in Kuwait, Omar became a naturalized American citizen following {{his marriage to}} the former Sandra Kay Sulzle. According to Omar, after the overthrow of <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> government, he traveled to Iraq seeking reconstruction-related work. He would have left by November 2004 but for his arrest and detention.|$|E

They picked small countries to invade, including Panama and Grenada, testing new military equipment and strategy, and breaking down resistance at home and abroad to U.S. military invasion as a policy option".|$|E

2500|$|This {{campaign}} {{featured a}} variety of new terminology, much of it initially coined by the U.S. government or military. The military official name for the invasion was Operation Iraqi Liberation , however this was quickly changed to [...] "Operation Iraqi Freedom". Also notable was the usage [...] "death squads" [...] to refer to Fedayeen paramilitary forces. Members of <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> government were called by disparaging nicknames – e.g., [...] "Chemical Ali" [...] (Ali Hassan al-Majid), [...] "Baghdad Bob" [...] or [...] "Comical Ali" [...] (Muhammed Saeed al-Sahaf), and [...] "Mrs. Anthrax" [...] or [...] "Chemical Sally" [...] (Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash).|$|E
2500|$|The Baghdad Central Prison ( [...] ), {{formerly}} known as Abu Ghraib prison ( [...] also Abu Ghuraib, lit. 'Father of Raven', or 'Place of Ravens') was a prison complex in Abu Ghraib, an Iraqi city 32km (20mi) west of Baghdad that operated from its construction in the 1950s until its closure the 2010s. Mass graves from <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> era have been uncovered at the site. Shared use by United States-led forces and the Iraqi government began in 2003 after the invasion of Iraq, the U.S. transferred complete control of the prison to the Iraqi government in 2006 and Iraqi authorities completely closed it down in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} article, Mark Malloch Brown, Kofi Annan's {{chief of staff}} at the United Nations, {{described}} The Sun as [...] "a pimple on the backside of American journalism." [...] According to Sherman, Brown [...] "accepts that the paper's obsession with the UN translates into influence ... he admitted the Sun [...] "does punch way above its circulation number, on occasion". He goes on to say, [...] "Clearly amongst its minuscule circulation were {{a significant number of}} diplomats. And so it did at times act as some kind of rebel house paper inside the UN. It fed the gossip mills and what was said in the cafeterias." [...] Brown's insult was {{in the context of the}} Sun's reporting of the UN's central role in <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> Oil-for-Food scandal.|$|E

2500|$|The Iraqis of largely African descent live mostly {{around the}} city of Basra, having {{been brought to the}} region as slaves over one {{thousand}} years ago to work the sugarcane plantations then in existence. Although they are Muslims and Arabic-speakers, Afro-Iraqis also retain some cultural and religious traditions from their ancestral homeland. They suffer considerable discrimination due to their behaviour, and, as a result, are restricted to working as entertainers or menial laborers. Moreover, they are often addressed by other Iraqis as abd, meaning [...] "slave". In the mid-9th century, black slaves around Basra rose in a rebellion, conquering their former masters and ruling the city for 15 years before being put down by forces sent by the Caliph in Baghdad. After the fall of <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> regime, Afro-Iraqis have once again begun to struggle for an improvement in their condition.|$|E
2500|$|The Howard Government {{committed}} {{troops to}} the Afghanistan War (with bi-partisan support) and the Iraq War (meeting with the disapproval of other political parties). SAS troops formed the most high-profile part of Operation Slipper, Australia's contribution to the invading force in the 2001 United States war in Afghanistan. A small number of Australians, including David Hicks, were captured {{in and around the}} Afghan Theatre having spent time training or fighting with Al Qaeda aligned Islamist paramilitaries. [...] Islamists following the Al Qaeda modus operandi [...] bombed a nightclub in Bali in 2002 and killed 88 Australian civilians. The following year, the Iraq War was launched [...] by a U.S.-British led Coalition to overthrow <b>the</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> government of Iraq for its non-compliance with the 1991 Gulf War Peace Treaty. Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq lasted until 2009 and was highly controversial.
