While he was off the field, <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> threw the ball, unaware he had no right fielder. The batter hit the pitch to right field, leading to a double. Manager Earl McNeely did not criticize Bordagaray, rather telling <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> {{to make sure his}} fielders were in place before throwing.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{distinct}} throwing styles used by <b>pitchers.</b> <b>The</b> most common style is a three-quarters delivery in which <b>the</b> <b>pitcher's</b> arm snaps downward with the release of <b>the</b> ball. Some <b>pitchers</b> use a sidearm delivery in which the arm arcs laterally to <b>the</b> torso. Some <b>pitchers</b> use a submarine style in which <b>the</b> <b>pitcher's</b> body tilts sharply downward on delivery, creating an exaggerated sidearm motion in which <b>the</b> <b>pitcher's</b> knuckles come very close to the mound.|$|R

5|$|Since 1957, {{there have}} been five Gold Glove batteries. <b>The</b> <b>pitcher</b> and catcher, collectively known as the battery, {{are the only two}} players on the field {{involved}} in every pitch. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> and catcher control the running game with tools such as pickoffs or the strength of the catcher's throwing arm. The first pitcher and catcher on the same team to win Gold Gloves in the same year were Jim Kaat and Earl Battey, with the Minnesota Twins in 1962. Only two pairs of batterymates have won Gold Gloves together more than once: Iván Rodríguez and Kenny Rogers won with the Texas Rangers in 2000, and again with the Detroit Tigers in 2004 and 2006. Yadier Molina and Adam Wainwright matched the feat, winning in both 2009 and 2013.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} other {{statistics}} that are kept are those collectively known as situational statistics. For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against. If a given situation statistically favors a certain batter, {{the manager of the}} fielding team {{may be more likely to}} change pitchers or have <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> intentionally walk the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of each half-inning, the nine players on the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, <b>the</b> <b>pitcher,</b> stands on the pitcher's mound. <b>The</b> <b>pitcher</b> begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another player, the catcher, squats {{on the far side of}} home plate, facing <b>the</b> <b>pitcher.</b> The rest of the team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher. Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well, though the number will vary depending on the level of play; amateur or children's games may only have an umpire behind the plate, while as many as six umpires can be used for important major league games.|$|E

50|$|For example, the Major League Baseball {{game played}} between the Colorado Rockies and San Francisco Giants on May 28, 2006, {{resulted}} in a 6 - 3 win by the Rockies. <b>The</b> starting <b>pitcher</b> for <b>the</b> Rockies, Byung-hyun Kim, was credited with a win and denoted as <b>the</b> winning <b>pitcher,</b> and <b>the</b> starting <b>pitcher</b> for <b>the</b> Giants, Jamey Wright, was charged with the loss and denoted as <b>the</b> losing <b>pitcher.</b> Kim and Wright were <b>the</b> <b>pitchers</b> of record for the game.|$|R
5|$|Following the 2013 season, Fister {{was named}} {{a finalist for the}} Gold Glove Award for <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> {{position}} alongside Mark Buehrle and R.A. Dickey. Fister finished the season with zero errors for a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage. Additionally, he led all American League pitchers in putouts (23) and double plays started (5), and was seventh in assists (29).|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} the next day's game, a tearful Joyce met Galarraga at home plate to receive the Tigers' lineup card. The two shook hands and Joyce gave <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> {{a pat on the}} shoulder, with a warm {{reception}} from the audience. Joyce's accountability and regret, and Galarraga's sportsmanship were widely praised for turning the unfortunate situation into a positive.|$|E
5|$|Lavender {{created a}} {{controversy}} {{in a game}} on September23, when he was caught altering the baseball by rubbing it against an emery board that he had attached to his uniform's pant leg, an illegal act. At the time, the fine for such an infraction was a five-dollar fine. The Phillies players noticed that <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> was constantly scratching {{the side of his}} leg. They asked the umpire to search <b>the</b> <b>pitcher.</b> Lavender refused to be searched and ran into the outfield, and the umpire refused to chase Lavender. Eventually, a particularly fast Phillies player, Hans Lobert, was able to catch up with him and grab the offending item. As a result of this incident, AL president, Ban Johnson, decreed that any pitcher in his league caught using sandpaper to alter the baseball, would be suspended for 30days and fined $100. This rule became the forebearer of the rule banning other pitches as well, including the spitball. In his 37 games pitched in 1914, 28were as the starting pitcher. His win–loss record was 11–11, and he lowered his ERA down to 3.07in 214innings pitched.|$|E

5|$|Sandy Koufax {{emerged as}} a pitcher for the Dodgers during that {{championship}} season. Alston was criticized by Jackie Robinson and others over his sparse use of Koufax in his early career. During Koufax's second MLB start, he pitched a shutout, giving up two hits and striking out 14 batters. However, that success did not prompt {{a lot of opportunities}} for Koufax. <b>The</b> <b>pitcher</b> appeared in only 12 games that season, mostly in relief.|$|E

5|$|The {{tactical}} {{decision that}} precedes almost every {{play in a}} baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> what type of pitch to throw, {{as well as its}} general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against <b>the</b> <b>pitcher,</b> with the result being runners on base, if any, advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit {{to one side of the}} field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of an inning during which runs are scored after an error or passed ball, the official scorer attempts to recreate {{the events of the}} inning without the errors or passed balls. If in the official scorer's opinion a run would not have scored without the defensive lapses, then the run is unearned. If the scorer believes that a run would have scored anyway, the run is earned and charged to <b>the</b> <b>pitcher.</b> In one basic example, if the first batter reaches by an error, the second batter hits a home run, and the next three batters strike out, then one of the two runs which were scored are unearned. There are rules and restrictions which govern this general guideline.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the finals series, the winner of two awards were announced. Matthew Blackmore won both <b>the</b> <b>Pitcher</b> of the Year award and the Finals Series MVP award. At the Baseball Australia Diamond Awards, held on 6 March at the Hotel Grand Chancellor, Adelaide, Wayne Lundgren was announced as the 35th winner of the Helms Award; the Claxton Shield's Most Valuable Player award. Lundgren was the first pitcher to win since 1986. Runners-up by two votes were Paul Mildren and Michael Collins.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1893 season, Chamberlain {{indicated}} his displeasure {{with the}} climate in Cincinnati {{and said that}} he hoped to pitch for New York or Philadelphia in the coming year. He also said that he would be happy to pitch in Buffalo if the city received a major league expansion team. Chamberlain stayed in Cincinnati for that season and the next one, earning 16–12 and 10–9 records. On May 30, 1894, Chamberlain was <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> when Bobby Lowe became the first major league player to hit four home runs in one game. Two of Lowe's home runs came in the same inning. Lowe hit only 70 career home runs in an 18-year career.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{to begin}} the 1975 season, Ellis {{continued}} to perform well {{at the beginning of}} the season. In August, the Pirates asked Ellis to pitch in the bullpen; he refused on consecutive nights. On August 15, 1975, Ellis refused assignment to the bullpen again; as a result, the Pirates suspended him for one day. Ellis called for a team meeting the next day, where he was expected to apologize. Instead, he berated Murtaugh, who responded by cursing at Ellis, ordering <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> out of the clubhouse and attempting to fight him. Coach Don Leppert reportedly also tried to fight Ellis. The Pirates suspended Ellis for thirty days and fined him $2,000. The suspension was lifted on August 30 when Ellis apologized to Murtaugh.|$|E

He started the 1948 season with Macon, then after winning eight games {{he was promoted to}} the Nashville Volunteers of the Class AA Southern Association, where he posted seven wins and two losses. While there, Volunteers owner Larry Gilbert gave him the nickname Bobo because <b>the</b> <b>pitcher</b> reminded him of Bobo Newsom; the nickname stuck with him the rest of his career.|$|E
