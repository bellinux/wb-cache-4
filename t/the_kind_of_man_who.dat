2500|$|In 1907, The Washington Post named Snow one of {{the three}} {{greatest}} football players to have played in the West, along with Walter Eckersall and Willie Heston. [...] The Post opined that Snow was an end quite worthy to rank with the great ends of the East and that he [...] "was just <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> would have been suited to the advanced requirements of the new game and its additional demand for alertness, in an end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roman consul Scipio Aemilianus {{questioned}} {{one of his}} opponents, P. Sulpicius Galus: [...] "For <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> adorns himself {{daily in}} front of a mirror, wearing perfume; whose eyebrows are shaved off; who walks around with plucked beard and thighs; who {{when he was a young}} man reclined at banquets next to his lover, wearing a long-sleeved tunic; who is fond of men as he is of wine: can anyone doubt that he has done what cinaedi are in the habit of doing?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The BBC {{describe}} Mark as [...] "a carefree rogue, a {{wild child}} of the 60's. He's a rolling stone, always looking for an excuse {{to go on the}} run." [...] Deemed by The Times to be [...] "flaky, irresponsible, and untrustworthy", Powell has assessed of his character [...] "he's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> is constantly in trouble. Mark's not malicious - he's worked as a nurse all his life - but he's certainly unreliable", imparting that he feels Mark as a phobia of authority. Although Powell stated in 2005 that Mark loved his wife and daughter dearly, he elaborated that: [...] "He's a man to whom everything seems like a good idea at the time! Tends to avoid confrontation but this is probably because he is beset by women!" [...] In 2008, a year after Tricia's death, the character referred to himself on-screen as [...] "By day, fearless Consultant Nurse. By night, lonely old fart." ...|$|E
50|$|Mary Dark, {{daughter}} of the general store's owner, {{is in love with}} Johnny, but isn't yet aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> he really is.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because they're not <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> I {{want to eat}} with," [...] she bluntly replied. [...] "They're just {{a little}} too coarse for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He must work, anyhow; that's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> he is, and I don't {{suppose he}} was much {{disappointed}} {{when he got a}} strenuous holiday." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. BRADMERE. Yes, that's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> gets treated badly. I'm afraid she's {{not worthy}} of him, Mrs. Burlacombe.|$|E
60|$|Uncle Tom was not <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> {{cared for}} riches. He {{was content to}} do his duty in that sphere where God had placed him.|$|E
60|$|With the {{exception}} of Wolverstone, who was by temperament <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> favours desperate chances, those officers received the proposal coldly. Hagthorpe incontinently opposed it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see, Staffer {{does most}} things well; he's {{excellent}} {{company and a}} witty talker, <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> a lad would try to copy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{nobody in}} particular," [...] she explained, {{laughing}} at the expression of my face: [...] "only an ideal. I've never met <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> I mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought not," [...] she said, [...] "I did {{not believe}} you were <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> to refuse for that reason. And {{you would have been}} elected." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you aren't <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> {{would care}} about the politicians, surely. If Humphrey Crewe can get elected by the people, I should think you might." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{look very}} nice," [...] she acknowledged, [...] "but you don't {{look at all}} <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> admires girls who do the sort of rubbish I do on the stage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How crude you are, Anna!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} {{with a little}} sigh. [...] "Sir John {{is not at all}} that sort. He is <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> would much prefer a little dust in his eyes. But heavens, I must pack!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Pratt's face cleared. [...] "Well, well! I {{will send}} her right down. Your brother is <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> {{we want to}} reach," [...] he added, as he went out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that so?" [...] said Prescott. [...] "I don't {{expect much}} from him. He's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> who's guided by {{appearances}} and seldom does {{anything out of}} the common." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "one has to {{take his}} chances when he has all to gain and very little to let up upon. That's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|She noticed {{now that}} he was greatly agitated. There were beads of {{perspiration}} on his brow. He was evidently in a state of overmastering fear. And yet he did not strike her as <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> would be afraid to meet death! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A respectable, {{hard-working}} burgher, son of well-to-do parents, brass-workers {{who live}} at Alkmaar. Honest, {{but not very}} clever; <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> grows rich, becomes a Burgomaster, founds a hospital for the poor, and has a fine monument put up to his memory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something of the sort." [...] In Theodore Watling's vigorous, sanity-exhaling {{presence}} Krebs's act appeared fantastic, ridiculous. [...] "He has queer {{notions about}} {{a new kind of}} democracy which he says is coming. I think he is <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> would be willing to die for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the whole, ye {{understand}} the position," [...] Nairn agreed, [...] "If ye desire {{my view of}} the matter, I would merely say that yon's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> he is." ...|$|R
6000|$|Carrie hesitated, {{although}} she was generally frank with Jake. [...] "Oh, well," [...] she said, [...] "I feel he ought to take a bold line; that's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> he is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jake {{always does}} come in time--that's {{one of his}} virtues. He's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> who's there when he's wanted. I don't know how he does it, because he's not really clever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We are not ill met, then,' {{said the}} man who was driving, 'for I am <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> can do that, and I am just looking out for such an apprentice. Get up behind with you,' he said to the boy, and off the horse went with them {{straight}} up into the air.|$|E
6000|$|... "As you know, I am not <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> puts {{himself out}} for {{every little thing}} he hears. I believe in letting the house work out their own salvation--with a light guiding hand on the reins, of course. But there is a {{perceptible}} lack of reverence---a lower tone in matters that touch {{the honor of the}} house, a sort of hardness." ...|$|E
60|$|Wade {{passed on}} without being seen. This {{recognition}} meant less {{to him than}} it would have ten years ago, as he was not now <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> hunted old enemies for revenge or who {{went to great lengths to}} keep out of their way. Men there were in Colorado who would shoot at him on sight. There had been more than one that had shot to his cost.|$|E
6000|$|Hetty laughed, {{but there}} was a thrill in her voice as she turned to Miss Schuyler. [...] "Now," [...] she said, [...] "you know <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> we raise on the prairie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{declared}} Lucy; [...] "nothing {{would have}} got it out <b>of</b> him. That's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> he is." [...] She paused a moment. [...] "What made you send Nevis after me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I had <b>the</b> <b>kindest</b> <b>of</b> {{notes from}} <b>the</b> <b>kindest</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> this morning, and {{am going to}} see him on Wednesday. Of course I mean the Duke of Devonshire. Can I take {{anything}} to Chatsworth for you? ...|$|R
6000|$|MacIan had {{understood}} his man pretty well {{up to that}} point; an instinct common to all men with the aristocratic tradition of Europe had guided him. He knew that <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> in his own back garden wears good clothes and spoils them with a bad hat is not <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> has an abstract horror of illegal actions of violence or the evasion of the police. But a man may understand ragging and yet be very far from understanding religious ragging. This seeming host of theirs might comprehend a quarrel of husband and lover or a difficulty at cards or even escape from a pursuing tailor; but it still remained doubtful whether he would feel the earth fail under him in that earthquake instant when the Virgin is compared to a goddess of Mesopotamia. Even MacIan, therefore (whose tact was far from being his strong point), felt the necessity for some compromise {{in the mode of}} approach. At last he said, and even then with hesitation: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} advise you, Miss MacNab," [...] said Dr Hood gravely, [...] "to {{be in any}} hurry to fetch the police. Father Brown, I seriously ask you to compose your flock, for their sakes, not for mine. Well, we have seen {{something}} of the figure and quality of Mr Glass; what are the chief facts known of Mr Todhunter? They are substantially three: that he is economical, that he {{is more or less}} wealthy, and that he has a secret. Now, surely it is obvious that there are the three chief marks of <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> is blackmailed. And surely it is equally obvious that the faded finery, the profligate habits, and the shrill irritation of Mr Glass are the unmistakable marks of <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> blackmails him. We have the two typical figures of a tragedy of hush money: on the one hand, the respectable man with a mystery; on the other, the West-end vulture with a scent for a mystery. These two men have met here today and have quarrelled, using blows and a bare weapon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Honey," [...] said Virginia, as {{they stood}} in the deep recess of the window, [...] "wouldn't it be nice if we could live here always, away from the world? Just we two! But you would never be content to do that," [...] she said, smiling reproachfully. [...] "You are <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> {{must be in the}} midst of things. In a little while you will have far more besides me to think about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I reckon {{you know}} best. He's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man,</b> gin'rally speaking, that other men, in a pow'ful hurry, don't care to meet--and, az a rule, don't FOLLER arter. It's gin'rally the other way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He gets indignant now and then. Virtuous {{people are}} {{generally}} content to resist temptation, but Wallace {{is apt to}} attack the tempter. I dare say it isn't wise, but that's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> he is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your uncle," [...] said Miss Port. [...] "He told me at our house. Of course, he didn't go into no particulars, {{but that}} isn't to be expected, he's not <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>man</b> to do that." ...|$|R
