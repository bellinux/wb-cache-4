5|$|By the 18th century, {{traffic was}} {{struggling}} {{along the narrow}} streets south of Holbein Gate, which led to King Street Gate being demolished in 1723. Holbein Gate, in turn, was demolished in 1759. Meanwhile, Parliament Street was a side road alongside the palace, leading to <b>the</b> <b>Palace</b> <b>of</b> Westminster. After <b>the</b> <b>Palace</b> <b>of</b> Whitehall was destroyed, Parliament Street was widened to match Whitehall's width. The present appearance of the street dates from 1899 after a group of houses between Downing Street and Great George Street were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Both Buddhism and the Lingbao School {{share the}} idea of the Five Paths of Rebirth (Gati). People were reborn into earth prisons, as a hungry ghost, as an animal, as a man, or as a {{celestial}} being. After death, the body would be alchemically refined in <b>the</b> <b>Palace</b> <b>of</b> Supreme Darkness located in the north, and the Southern Palace in the south. The transmutation of the body consisted of two steps; the yin components of the person were refined in <b>the</b> <b>Palace</b> <b>of</b> Supreme Darkness, followed by the yang components in the Southern Palace. The Lingbao concept of rebirth is a Chinese adaptation of Buddhism, mixing traditional Chinese concepts with newly arrived Buddhist ideas.|$|E

For example, foreign ambassadors are accredited to the Court of St James's, and the Palace {{is the site of}} the meeting of the Accession Council.
