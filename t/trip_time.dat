Bryce Canyon has eight marked and maintained hiking trails that can be hiked {{in less than a}} day (round <b>trip</b> <b>time,</b> trailhead): Mossy Cave (one hour, State Route 12 northwest of Tropic), Rim Trail (5–6 hours, anywhere on rim), Bristlecone Loop (one hour, Rainbow Point), and Queens Garden (1–2 hours, Sunrise Point) are easy to moderate hikes. Navajo Loop (1–2 hours, Sunset Point) and Tower Bridge (2–3 hours, north of Sunrise Point) are moderate hikes. Fairyland Loop (4–5 hours, Fairyland Point) and Peekaboo Loop (3–4 hours, Bryce Point) are strenuous hikes. Several of these trails intersect, allowing hikers to combine routes for more challenging hikes.|$|E
5|$|On March 16, 2009, the new South Ferry station opened, {{replacing}} the original loop station. The loop station could only accommodate {{the first five}} cars of a train and required the use of gap fillers because of the sharpness of the loop curve. The new station was built as a two-track, full (10-car)-length island platform on a less severe curve, permitting the operation of a typical terminal station. The newer station {{does not have a}} connection to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, and is underneath the loop station. The MTA claimed that the new station saved four to six minutes of a passenger's <b>trip</b> <b>time</b> and increased the peak capacity of the 1 service to 24 trains per hour, as opposed to 16 to 17 trains per hour with the loop station. This was the first new station to open since 1989 when the IND 63rd Street Line stations opened.|$|E
5|$|The regular {{services}} {{could be}} done with a round <b>trip</b> <b>time</b> of nine to ten days, including overnighting in Cairo, Karachi and Bangkok, and with technical revision of the plane in Hong Kong. At first there were semiweekly services, {{but by the end}} of 1947, these had increased to weekly. In June, Braathens SAFE bought a Douglas DC-3, LN-PAS Norse Carrier, and in August another DC-4, LN-PAW Norse Commander, both from KLM. In 1947, Braathens SAFE flew twenty-five trips to Hong Kong, five to New York and one to Johannesburg, South Africa, making a profit of NOK750,000. The following year, Braathens SAFE started the first trial flights to South America. The first flight was made on 23 August from Stavanger via Reykjavík, Gander and Bermuda to Caracas, where the plane landed on 26 August. In October, the airline flew to Panama, but neither route gave sufficient contracts to commence regular services. In 1948, the airline made fifty trips to Hong Kong, eight to Johannesburg, two to the United States, three to Venezuela and two to Panama.|$|E
40|$|Due {{to rapid}} {{increasing}} in complexity of Internet, quantifying {{the performance of}} protocol helps in assessing the application behavior with respect to network performance. TCP is an important protocol {{that is used by}} some important applications on Internet such as HTTP, FTP and soon. To analyze TCP, Round <b>trip</b> <b>times</b> is one of the metric used. As it is a internal metric of TCP used to find the retransmission timeout of sent packet. Round <b>trip</b> <b>times</b> means measuring elapsed time between the sent packet and recieving its acknowledgment that covers the sequence number of the sent packet(i. e., from source to destination and vice-a-versa). Round <b>trip</b> <b>times</b> is a metric that is recognised by IETF as Quality of Service parameter. We design a tool here that will calculate the round <b>trip</b> <b>times</b> for each stream. This round <b>trip</b> <b>times</b> helps us to understand the protocol behavior. In this document, we discuss the design, implementation issues carried out while developing the tool.

25|$|One way {{to obtain}} a {{distance}} measurement {{is based on the}} time-of-flight: transmit a short pulse of radio signal (electromagnetic radiation) and measure the time it takes for the reflection to return. The distance is one-half the product of the round <b>trip</b> <b>time</b> (because the signal has to travel to the target and then back to the receiver) and the speed of the signal. Since radio waves travel at the speed of light, accurate distance measurement requires high-speed electronics.|$|E

25|$|Illinois has an {{extensive}} passenger and freight rail transportation network.

25|$|In 2003, {{money was}} {{allocated}} {{for the construction}} of a new station at South Ferry, and in 2005, construction commenced on the new station. Initially, the station's construction had been opposed because of the high cost and low perceived time savings. The South Ferry loop station only accommodates the first five cars of a train, so that the rear five cars of a 10-car 1 train cannot load or unload. Because of the curve at the station gap fillers are required, and as a result the new station was built as a two-track, full (10-car)-length island platform on a less severe curve, permitting the operation of a typical terminal station.
