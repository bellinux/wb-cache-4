5|$|In 1990, the IRS seized most of Nelson's assets, {{claiming}} that he owed US$32,000,000. In addition to the unpaid taxes, Nelson's situation was worsened by the weak investments he had made during the early 1980s. In 1978, after he fired Reshen, Nelson was introduced by Dallas lawyer Terry Bray to <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>firm</b> Price Waterhouse. To repay the debt Reshen had created with the IRS, Nelson was recommended to invest in tax shelters that ultimately flopped. While the IRS disallowed his deductions for 1980, 1981 and 1982 (at a time that Nelson's income multiplied), due to penalties and interests, the debt increased {{by the end of}} the decade.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to examine}} {{the factors that influence}} auditor’s job satisfaction, the effects of job satisfaction on performance and turnover intentions, and how far the performances moderate the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intention. The unit of analysis from this study is an auditor who works on a public <b>accounting</b> <b>firm.</b> Results showed that in small <b>accounting</b> <b>firms,</b> only consideration leadership style affects auditor’s satisfaction, while in big <b>accounting</b> <b>firms,</b> leadership style and structure leadership style have affected auditor’s satisfaction. Considerate Leadership style has higher effect than structural leadership style. For auditors in <b>the</b> big <b>accounting</b> <b>firms,</b> <b>the</b> higher the auditor's position, the greater the desire to leave <b>accounting</b> <b>firms,</b> but <b>the</b> longer the experience of the auditors, the lower the desire to move from <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>firms.</b> In this case it is necessary to have periodic promotion policy in <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>firms.</b> Job satisfaction has a positive influence on performance on all types of <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>firms.</b> If auditors are satisfied with the work, then their turnover intentions will be low. If auditors have low job satisfaction, they will leave <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>firms,</b> no matter their performance level because they only consider <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>firms</b> as stepping stone for their next career. So firms must consider auditors' job satisfaction if {{they do not want to}} lose their auditors...|$|R

Many students and alumni enlisted in {{the first wave of}} patriotic fervor that swept the nation in 1914, but in the spring of 1915 — after the first wave of heavy Canadian casualties at Ypres — Hamilton Gault, the founder of the Canadian regiment and a wealthy Montreal businessman, was faced with a desperate shortage of troops.

5|$|The {{avalanche}} of editorial opinion continued the following day, Sunday, September 21, but Eisenhower continued to withhold judgment.

One of his major responsibilities was the analysis of U.S. bombers' efficiency and effectiveness, especially the B-29 forces commanded by Major General Curtis LeMay in India, China, and the Mariana Islands. McNamara established a statistical control unit for the XX Bomber Command and devised schedules for B-29s doubling as transports for carrying fuel and cargo over The Hump.

25|$|The lottery is {{conducted}} with witnesses (from <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>firm</b> Ernst & Young) verifying that all fourteen balls are represented once {{as they are}} placed in the lottery machine. The balls are placed in the machine for 20 seconds to randomize before the first ball is drawn. The remaining three balls are drawn at 10-second intervals. NBA officials determine which team holds the winning combination and that franchise is awarded the #1 overall draft pick. The four balls are returned to the machine and the process is repeated to determine {{the second and third}} picks. In the event that a combination belongs to a team that has already won its pick (or if the one unassigned combination comes up), the round is repeated until a unique winner is determined. When the first three teams have been determined, the remaining picks are given out based on regular season record with the worst teams getting the highest picks. This assures each team that it can drop no more than three spots from its projected draft position.|$|E
