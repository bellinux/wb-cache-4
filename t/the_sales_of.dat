40|$|This Note {{argues that}} it is {{essential}} to <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> Goods Convention that the current controversy regarding exclusions be resolved uniformly by all ratifying nations. Part I discusses the negotiations that led to <b>the</b> <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> Goods Convention’s exclusion provision. Part II identifies <b>the</b> <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> Goods Convention’s primary goal of uniformity and the arguments promoting implied exclusions. Part III examines the arguments favoring express exclusions. This Note concludes that a uniform resolution allowing only express exclusions would be most consistent with the overriding principles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sale</b> <b>of</b> Goods Convention...|$|R

5|$|From Russia, with Love was {{released}} in the UK as a hardback on 8 April 1957, by the publishers Jonathan Cape. The American edition was published {{a few weeks later}} by Macmillan. In November 1956 the Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Eden, had visited Fleming's Jamaican Goldeneye estate, to recuperate from a breakdown in his health. This was much reported in the British press, and the publication of From Russia, with Love was accompanied by a promotional campaign that capitalised on Fleming's raised public profile. The serialisation of the story in The Daily Express in 1957 provided a boost to <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> the book; a bigger rise in sales was to follow four years later. In an article in Life on 17 March 1961, the US President John F. Kennedy listed From Russia, with Love as one of his ten favourite books. This accolade, and its associated publicity, led to a surge in sales that made Fleming the biggest-selling crime writer in the US. There was a further boost to sales following the release of the film of the same name in 1963, which saw <b>the</b> <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> the Pan paperback rise from 145,000 in 1962 to 642,000 in 1963 and 600,000 in 1964.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the public, through newspapers, {{followed}} Baden-Powell's {{struggle to}} hold Mafeking, {{and when the}} siege was broken, {{he had become a}} national hero.
