5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to settle in France, he moved to Britain {{and then to the}} capital of present-day Belgium, Brussels, where he settled.

Several colleagues moved there with him, including two physicians with an interest in orgone, and Lois Wyvell, who ran the Orgone Press Institute.

5|$|The Badlands are a rocky and hilly valley on the {{northern}} borders of the Septimus Heap world, where DomDaniel once practised his dark magic in an observatory atop a hill.

5|$|The {{area around}} Goodison Park when built was a dense area full of terraced housing, and Goodison Avenue behind the Park End stand was no different. Oddly housing was built {{right into the}} stand itself (as shown on old {{photographs}} of Goodison and in programmes). The club had previously owned many of the houses {{on the road and}} rented them to players. One of the players <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>there,</b> Dixie Dean later had a statue erected in his honour near the Park End on Walton Lane.|$|E
5|$|The {{water in}} the bog is low in {{nutrients}} and high in acidity, which {{makes it difficult for}} most plants <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>there.</b> Only specialized plants can thrive in the park bogs: there are three species of carnivorous plants and seventeen varieties of orchid. Wild cranberries and blueberries grow in the bog along with sedges, leatherleaf shrubs, Arctic cotton grass, and viburnums. The bogs are all protected by the state of Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{cultural}} {{trait of}} Chiprovtsi shared {{with much of}} the region is the veneration of a family patron saint, named svetets ("saint") and akin to Serbian slava. The practice exists since time immemorial and the family saint is thought to have been chosen by the taking of a random candle by an unaware person. The svetets is associated to the family house: when a daughter-in-law comes <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>there,</b> she accepts the family saint of the home, and when a family member or a foreign settler moves out or builds a new house, they adopt a new svetets.|$|E
5|$|Both were arrested, with Lennon {{pleading}} guilty to hashish possession, absolving Ono, who miscarried not long after. Lennon was fined £150 ($360). Note: in November1973, Pilcher was arrested for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after it was alleged he had committed perjury. He was {{convicted and sentenced to}} four years imprisonment. After the raid, the landlord sought an injunction against Starr on 19February1969, forbidding anyone but Starr or his family <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>there,</b> and allowing no music or instruments to be played. Starr appealed, and a compromise was offered; only Starr or a family member would live in the flat. To finally settle the case, Starr sold the lease on 28February1969.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Delius and Jelka had {{returned}} to Grez. He had begun to show symptoms of syphilis that he had probably contracted in the 1880s. He took treatment at clinics across Europe, but by 1922 he was walking with two sticks, and by 1928 he was paralysed and blind. There was no return to the prosperity of pre-war years: Delius's medical treatment was an additional expense, his blindness prevented him from composing, and his royalties were curtailed by the lack of continental performances of his music. Beecham gave discreet financial help, and the composer and musical benefactor H. Balfour Gardiner bought the house at Grez and allowed Delius and Jelka <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>there</b> rent-free.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{with the}} end of the two mathematicians' cryptologic work at the close of World War II, the Cipher Bureau ceased to exist. From nearly its {{inception}} in 1931 until war's end in 1945, the Bureau, sometimes incorporated into aggregates under cryptonyms (PC Bruno and Cadix), had been essentially the same agency, with most of the same core personnel, carrying out much the same tasks; now it was extinguished. Neither Rejewski nor Zygalski would work again as cryptologists. In late 1946 Rejewski returned to his family in a devastated and politically altered Poland, <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>there</b> another 33 years until his death in February 1980. Zygalski would remain in England until his death in August 1978.|$|E

Gordon-Ives died on 8 September 1907 and the estate passed to his son, Cecil Maynard Gordon-Ives, a Captain of the Scots Guards in the First World War, who occupied it until his death on 23 July 1923. The Bentworth Hall Estate was then purchased by Arthur d'Anyers Willis in 1924 and was sold again to Major John Arthur Pryor in 1932, who lived at Bentworth Hall until the estate {{was taken over by}} the military during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|In January 1727, Spain {{declared}} the nullification of the Treaty of Utrecht's provisions relating to Gibraltar {{on the grounds}} that Britain had violated its terms by extending Gibraltar's fortifications beyond the permitted limits, allowing Jews and Moors <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>there,</b> failing to protect Catholics and harming Spain's revenues by allowing smuggling. Spanish forces began a siege and bombardment of Gibraltar the following month, causing severe damage through intensive cannon fire. The defenders withstood the threat and were reinforced and resupplied by a British naval force. Bad weather and supply problems caused the Spanish to call off the siege at the end of June.|$|E
5|$|Isle Verde, where {{approximately}} 2,300people were killed, {{was declared}} uninhabitable by officials; however, residents still {{returned to the}} area due to a need for land. Eventually, signs that used to warn people not {{to stay on the}} islet were eventually taken down and people were no longer warned not <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>there.</b> A resettlement community was constructed months later, with plans to house 912 of the 2,668families that needed to be moved from the area. Those that were not moved were left on Isle Verde despite orders not to stay there. Another resettlement project for 700families was planned at the cost of $1million.|$|E
5|$|Kneale {{was born}} Thomas Nigel Kneale in Barrow-in-Furness, England. His family {{came from the}} Isle of Man, and {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>there</b> in 1928, when Kneale was six years old. He {{was raised in the}} island's capital, Douglas, where his father was the owner and editor of the local newspaper, The Herald. He was educated at St Ninian's High School, Douglas, and after leaving studied law, training to become an advocate at the Manx Bar. He also worked in a lawyer's office, but became bored with his legal training and eventually abandoned the profession. At the beginning of the Second World War Kneale attempted to enlist in the British Army, but was deemed medically unfit for service owing to photophobia, from which he had suffered since childhood.|$|E
