40|$|Abstract. The nonnegative matrix {{factorization}} (NMF) is a bound-constrained low-rank approximation {{technique for}} nonnegative multi-variate data. NMF {{has been studied}} extensively over the last years, but an important aspect which only has received little attention so far is a proper initialization of <b>the</b> <b>NMF</b> factors {{in order to achieve}} a faster error reduction. Since <b>the</b> <b>NMF</b> objective function is usually non-differentiable, discontinuous, and may possess many local minima, heuristic search al-gorithms are a promising choice as initialization enhancers for NMF. In this paper we investigate the application of five population based algorithms (genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, fish school search, differential evolution, and fireworks algorithm) as new initializa-tion variants for NMF. Experimental evaluation shows that some of them are well suited as initialization enhancers and can reduce <b>the</b> number of <b>NMF</b> iterations needed to achieve a given accuracy. Moreover, we com-pare the general applicability of these five optimization algorithms for continuous optimization problems, such as <b>the</b> <b>NMF</b> objective function. ...|$|R
30|$|In Figs. 5 and 6, {{the changes}} of <b>the</b> <b>NmF</b> 2 values are {{dominated}} by the diurnal variation for all seasons, and maximum NmF 2 values increase with the solar activity except in July. In July, the representative month of summer, dependency of NmF 2 values on the solar activity is drastically reduced. Note that <b>the</b> <b>NmF</b> 2 patterns of low solar activity cases in July are significantly different from higher solar activity cases and their error bars are unusually large because sudden enhancements of NmF 2 during daytime occurred frequently in summer for the quiet period from 2006 to 2007, which {{will be discussed in}} Section 4. In most cases, <b>the</b> <b>NmF</b> 2 is minimized around 5 LT just before sunrise, and it rapidly increases after sunrise, obviously due to ionization by solar EUV flux. Dependency of geomagnetic activity on <b>the</b> <b>NmF</b> 2 values is not clear, although <b>the</b> maximum <b>NmF</b> 2 increases with geomagnetic activity in some cases. <b>The</b> maximum <b>NmF</b> 2 appears around 12 LT for all geomagnetic and solar activities in January and October, whereas the maximum is delayed by as much as 2 – 3 hours for the cases of low and moderate solar activity in April. In July, NmF 2 variations are too small to determine the maximum time reliably. In January, NmF 2 show particularly small error bars for all cases, compared to other seasons. Note that the error bars are sometimes omitted in the figure where reliable fitting cannot be made due to lack of data, especially for some cases of the high geomagnetic condition. The IRI- 2007 model well traces <b>the</b> Anyang <b>NmF</b> 2 values for most cases with noticeable departure for the cases of low solar activity in July. We will discuss this departure in the next section.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new method to {{incorporate}} priors on {{the solution of}} nonnegative matrix factorization (<b>NMF).</b> <b>The</b> <b>NMF</b> solution is guided to follow the {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE) estimates of the weight combinations under a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior. The proposed algorithm can be used for denoising or single-channel source separation (SCSS) applications. NMF is used in SCSS in two main stages, the training stage and the separation stage.

In the separation stage, the prior GMMs are used to guide <b>the</b> <b>NMF</b> solution of <b>the</b> gains/weights matrices using MMSE estimation. <b>The</b> <b>NMF</b> decomposition weights matrix is treated as a distorted image by a distortion operator, which is learned directly from the observed signals.
