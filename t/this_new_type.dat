Individuals who found jobs at the rural camps unfulfilling and meaningless, volunteered for <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>type</b> of assignment. The mental health field promised to provide the work of national importance that the program was designed to produce. By the end of 1945, more than 2000 CPS men worked in 41 institutions in 20 states.|$|E
5|$|Pick {{wanted a}} new type of {{building}} for the more open sites of the stations on the Piccadilly line's extensions. To decide what <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>type</b> should look like, he and Holden made a short tour of Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands in July and August 1930 to see the latest developments in modern architecture. Pick was disappointed with much of the new architecture that he saw in Germany and Sweden, considering it either too extreme or unsatisfactorily experimental. The architecture in the Netherlands was much more to his liking, particularly buildings by Willem Marinus Dudok in Hilversum. Although the architecture in Denmark was not considered remarkable, Pick was impressed with the way in which designers there were often responsible for all elements of a building including the interior fixtures and fittings.|$|E
5|$|Puglia {{was built}} by the new Regia Marina {{shipyard}} in Taranto, the first major warship to be built there. Her keel was laid down in October 1893, and she was launched on 22 September 1898. Fitting-out work {{proved to be a}} lengthy process, and she was not ready for service until 26 May 1901. By this time, her design was over ten years old and the ship was rapidly becoming obsolescent; in comparison, Germany had already commissioned the world's first light cruisers, the , which were significantly faster and better armed. <b>This</b> <b>new</b> <b>type</b> of ship rapidly replaced protected cruisers like Puglia.|$|E

5|$|When the Umayyad Muslims {{invaded the}} Iberian {{peninsula}} in 711 AD, their invasion brought Barb horses, which were crossed with native Iberian horses. The cross {{between these two}} breeds produced a war horse superior even to the original Iberian horse, and it was <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>type</b> that the Conquistadors introduced to the Americas. Called the Iberian war horse, this ancestor of the Lusitano was used both on the battlefield and in major riding academies throughout Europe. Bullfighting on horseback and displays of high school dressage were common entertainment for the Portuguese gentry.|$|E

25|$|Five National Recreation Areas {{were added}} to the System between 1933 and 1964. <b>This</b> <b>new</b> <b>type</b> of federal park area grew out of large scale {{reclamation}} projects like Hoover Dam and multi purpose river basin development programs like the Tennessee Valley Authority which began in the 1930s and spread to river valleys {{in all parts of the}} country after World War II.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>new</b> <b>type</b> of diving {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the Regia Marina which founded the first special forces underwater frogman unit, later copied by the Royal Navy and United States Navy. Capitano di Fregata (Commander) Paolo Aloisi was the first commander of the 1ª Flottiglia Mezzi d'Assalto ("First Assault Vehicle Flotilla"), formed in 1939 as a result of the research and development efforts of Majors Teseo Tesei and Elios Toschi of the naval combat engineers. The two resurrected Paolucci's and Rossetti's concept of manned torpedoes.|$|E
50|$|These 6 ships (of 26 planned) ordered {{under the}} 1935 Program were {{improved}} and enlarged {{versions of the}} 1934 and 1934A classes. Most of the serious faults of the earlier ships had been resolved: engine reliability and the structural integrity was much improved and they were much better seagoing ships, shipping less water through an improvement {{in the design of}} the bows.

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>new</b> <b>type</b> of {{variable}} assist power steering has since {{spread throughout the}} vehicle population. DIRAVI as it was called, allowed great assistance to the motorist while parking, but little assistance at motorway speeds. The system adjusts the hydraulic pressure on the steering centering cam according to vehicle speed so {{that the amount of}} steering feel remained almost constant at any speed, counteracting the tendency of manual and ordinary power assisted steering to feel light at high speed. Thus the car turns easily at low speed, emphasized by high gearing given two turns lock-lock, and relatively more effort is required at higher speed.|$|E
25|$|Between the seventeenth-century and {{the early}} {{eighteenth-century}} the lightning system of the streets of London was radically transformed with the adoption of lamps with convex lens: a bull's eye glass that {{had the effect of}} concentrating the light. <b>This</b> <b>new</b> <b>type</b> of lamp lit up much more of the street than it was usual with candles and lanterns with horn sides; though they produced such a concentrated beam of light to dazzle the passers-by, and preventing them from seeing possible near dangers. According to Moreton, {{this is not just a}} minor annoyance but a real peril for the common citizen's life and conversely an unexpected facilitator for criminals.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of multimodality, {{at its most}} basic level, can change the way an audience perceives information. The most basic understanding of language comes via semiotics – the association between words and symbols. A multimodal text changes its semiotic effect by placing words with preconceived meanings in a new context, whether that context is audio, visual, or digital. This in turn creates a new, foundationally different meaning for an audience. Bezemer and Kress, two scholars on multimodality and semiotics, argue that students understand information differently when text is delivered in conjunction with a secondary medium, such as image or sound, than when it is presented in alphanumeric format only. This is due to it drawing a viewer’s attention to “both the originating site and the site of recontextualization”. Meaning is moved from one medium to the next, which requires the audience to redefine their semiotic connections. Recontextualizing an original text within other mediums creates a different sense of understanding for the audience, and <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>type</b> of learning can be controlled by the types of media used.|$|E

The Ju 87's standard Revi C12D gunsight was replaced with the new Nachtrevi ("Nightrevi") C12N. On some Ju 87s, the Revi 16D was exchanged for the Nachtrevi 16D. To help the pilot see his instrument panel, a violet light was installed.|$|E
500|$|In the 19th century, harness racing {{began to}} rise in {{popularity}} in Norway and breeders looked to create a horse suitable for that sport. The Dole Trotter, a smaller, lighter, faster variation of the draft-type Dole Gudbrandsdal, was then developed. Infusions of Thoroughbred blood, {{as well as that}} of various trotting and heavy draft breeds, was used to create <b>this</b> <b>new</b> <b>type.</b> [...] The Dole Trotter was especially influenced between 1840 and 1860 by two other stallions, Toftebrun and Dovre (an Arabian); the latter is the foundation stallion of the Dole Trotter type.

500|$|During the 17th century, horses from Perche, the {{ancestors}} of the current Percheron, were smaller, standing between [...] high, and more agile. These horses were almost uniformly gray; paintings and drawings from the Middle Ages generally show French knights on mounts of this color. After {{the days of the}} armored knight, the emphasis in horse breeding was shifted so as to develop horses better able to pull heavy stage coaches at a fast trot. Gray horses were preferred because their light coloring was more visible at night. <b>This</b> <b>new</b> <b>type</b> of horse was called the [...] "Diligence Horse", because the stage coaches they pulled were named [...] "diligences". After the stage coach was replaced by rail, the modern Percheron type arose as a slightly heavier horse for use in agriculture and heavy hauling work moving goods from docks to railway terminals.|$|E
