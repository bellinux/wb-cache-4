40|$|The vehicle engines having gaseous {{sequential}} injection systems of {{liquefied petroleum gas}} (LPG) are operated on gasoline until the engine coolant reaches the required temperature because {{the heat of the}} engine coolant passing through the <b>evaporator</b> and <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> (E&PR) is not enough to vaporize the LPG that is at liquid phase. Therefore, the fuel economy and the decreasing pollutant emissions emitted to the environment through use of LPG cannot be completely achieved at cold start of the engines. In this study, an E&PR that can store thermal energy was designed by using of phase change material (PCM) in order to overcome cold start problem of E&PR in vehicles operated with LPG. The thermal behavior of the E&PR with PCM was determined at idle operating conditions and the effects of using the E&PR surrounded with PCM on exhaust emissions (HC, CO) were examined. It was observed from the study that the E&PR with PCM can solve the cold start problem of the LPG powered engines. The E&PR surrounded with PCM could start the engine with LPG after the 15 h cooling period of the engine and LPG usage decreased HC and CO emissions by 17. 32 % and 28. 71 %, respectively...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of thermal {{expansion}} valves: internally or externally equalized. The difference between externally and internally equalized valves is how the <b>evaporator</b> <b>pressure</b> affects {{the position of the}} needle. In internally equalized valves, the <b>evaporator</b> <b>pressure</b> against the diaphragm is the pressure at the inlet of the evaporator, whereas in externally equalized valves, the <b>evaporator</b> <b>pressure</b> against the diaphragm is the pressure at the outlet of the <b>evaporator.</b> Externally equalized <b>thermostatic</b> expansion valves compensate for any pressure drop through the evaporator.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} of 13 working fluids in two Organic Rankine Cycles, which operate as the bottoming cycles for recovering waste heat from gas turbine modular helium reactor (GT-MHR), is investigated. Working fluids are classified in three dry, isentropic and wet fluids. The effect of varying pump temperature and <b>evaporator</b> <b>pressure</b> on the thermal efficiency, total exergy loss of the combined cycle is studied for each category, {{and the results are}} compared. The results are calculated for an optimum pressure ratio in which thermal efficiency is maximum. According to the results, dry fluids show a higher thermal efficiency while wet fluids have the lowest values. However, the highest value for thermal efficiency is for R 141 b, which is an isentropic fluid. Furthermore, the results indicate that pump temperature increase, reduces the total thermal efficiency and increases the total exergy loss of the combined cycle. Increasing <b>evaporator</b> <b>pressure</b> leads to an optimum pressure that maximizes total thermal efficiency.

40|$|Large mobile {{irrigation}} {{machines are}} becoming a common sight in Australian broadacre irrigation, replacing traditional surface methods. These machines give the potential of irrigating large areas with high efficiency and with a uniformity of above 80 % when designed correctly. A major component of the large mobile irrigation machine is the sprinkler application package commissioned with the machine. <b>Pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> {{are becoming a}} common {{part of the package}} when large mobile irrigation machines are commissioned. <b>Pressure</b> <b>regulators</b> are installed upstream of the nozzle and provide a constant output pressure regardless of the input pressure into the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> The device acts as a variable headloss. Input pressure changes are a common occurrence on large mobile irrigation machines and typically are from topographic changes as the machines travel through the field. The application rate is directly influenced by the output pressure from the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator,</b> thus this shows the importance of accurately understanding to performance of the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> Reviewing previous literature it was known that the methodology development was a crucial part in understanding the <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> performance. The development of a solid robust methodology was the primary objective of this dissertation. Eight stages of testing occurred each with incremental changes to develop the methodology for testing. The way the testing was undertaking proved to influence the results of the test. A statistical analysis in terms of an ANOVA and sample size calculations was undertaken on a limited set of data.

40|$|AbstractR 134 a–DMAC vapour {{absorption}} {{refrigeration system}} (VARS) needs rectifier. Because of incomplete rectification, {{a small amount}} of DMAC is carried to evaporator. It results in a temperature gradient and also formation of residual liquid in the evaporator. This liquid causes cooling loss which can be recovered significantly by using liquid vapour heat exchanger (LVHX). The same cooling temperature can be attained at a range of <b>evaporator</b> <b>pressures</b> due to the temperature gradient. For fixed cooling temperature, the system COP enhances with <b>evaporator</b> <b>pressure.</b> The enhancement rate is more when efficiencies of rectifier and LVHX are high. Efficient solution heat exchanger (SHX) is vital owing to its large heat duty. Rectifier loses its importance if high efficiency LVHX is used.
