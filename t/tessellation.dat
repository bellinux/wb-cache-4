5|$|The {{concept of}} duality applies {{as well to}} {{infinite}} graphs embedded in the plane {{as it does to}} finite graphs. However, care is needed to avoid topological complications such as points of the plane that are neither part of an open region disjoint from the graph nor part of an edge or vertex of the graph. When all faces are bounded regions surrounded by a cycle of the graph, an infinite planar graph embedding can also be viewed as a <b>tessellation</b> of the plane, a covering of the plane by closed disks (the tiles of the <b>tessellation)</b> whose interiors (the faces of the embedding) are disjoint open disks. Planar duality gives rise to the notion of a dual <b>tessellation,</b> a <b>tessellation</b> formed by placing a vertex at the center of each tile and connecting the centers of adjacent tiles.|$|E

A {{particularly}} interesting type of monohedral <b>tessellation</b> is the spiral monohedral tiling. The first spiral monohedral tiling was discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936; the Voderberg tiling has a unit tile that is a nonconvex enneagon. The Hirschhorn tiling, published by Michael D. Hirschhorn and D. C. Hunt in 1985, is a pentagon tiling using irregular pentagons: regular pentagons cannot tile the Euclidean plane as the internal angle of a regular pentagon, , is not a divisor of 2.|$|E

Overlapping {{allows for the}} seamless stitching of the partial Delaunay <b>tessellations</b> constructed by individual processors. The algorithm is then modified, {{by the addition of}} stereographic projections, to handle the parallel construction of spherical Delaunay and Voronoi <b>tessellations.</b> The algorithms are then embedded into algorithms for the parallel construction of planar and spherical centroidal Voronoi <b>tessellations</b> that require multiple constructions of Delaunay <b>tessellations.</b> Computational tests are used to demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the algorithms for spherical Delaunay and centroidal Voronoi <b>tessellations.</b> Compared to serial versions of the algorithm and to the STRIPACK-based approaches, the new parallel algorithm results in significant speedups for the construction of spherical centroidal Voronoi <b>tessellations...</b>|$|R
40|$|A new {{and rather}} broad class of {{stationary}} (i. e. stochastically translation invariant) random <b>tessellations</b> of the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space is introduced, which are called shape-driven nested Markov <b>tessellations.</b> Locally, these <b>tessellations</b> are constructed {{by means of}} a spatio-temporal random recursive split dynamics governed by a family of Markovian split kernel, generalizing thereby the [...] by now classical [...] construction of iteration stable random <b>tessellations.</b> By providing an explicit global construction of the <b>tessellations,</b> it is shown that under suitable assumptions on the split kernels (shape-driven), there exists a unique time-consistent whole-space tessellation-valued Markov process of stationary random <b>tessellations</b> compatible with the given split kernels.

5|$|Mathematicians {{use some}} {{technical}} terms when discussing tilings. An edge is the intersection between two bordering tiles; {{it is often}} a straight line. A vertex {{is the point of}} intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an isogonal or vertex-transitive tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of polygons about each vertex is the same. The fundamental region is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the <b>tessellation.</b> For example, a regular <b>tessellation</b> of the plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every vertex.|$|E
5|$|More formally, a <b>tessellation</b> or tiling is a {{cover of}} the Euclidean plane by a {{countable}} number of closed sets, called tiles, such that the tiles intersect only on their boundaries. These tiles may be polygons or any other shapes. Many tessellations are formed from {{a finite number of}} prototiles in which all tiles in the <b>tessellation</b> are congruent to the given prototiles. If a geometric shape {{can be used as a}} prototile to create a <b>tessellation,</b> the shape is said to tessellate or to tile the plane. The Conway criterion is a sufficient but not necessary set of rules for deciding if a given shape tiles the plane periodically without reflections: some tiles fail the criterion but still tile the plane. No general rule has been found for determining if a given shape can tile the plane or not, which means there are many unsolved problems concerning tessellations.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{the colour}} of a tile is {{understood}} {{as part of the}} tiling; at other times arbitrary colours may be applied later. When discussing a tiling that is displayed in colours, to avoid ambiguity one needs to specify whether the colours are part of the tiling or just part of its illustration. This affects whether tiles with the same shape but different colours are considered identical, which in turn affects questions of symmetry. The four colour theorem states that for every <b>tessellation</b> of a normal Euclidean plane, with a set of four available colours, each tile can be coloured in one colour such that no tiles of equal colour meet at a curve of positive length. The colouring guaranteed by the four-colour theorem does not generally respect the symmetries of the <b>tessellation.</b> To produce a colouring which does, it is necessary to treat the colours as part of the <b>tessellation.</b> Here, as many as seven colours may be needed, as in the picture at right.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the seminal}} work of Mecke, Nagel and Weiss, the {{iteration}} stable (STIT) <b>tessellations</b> have attracted considerable interest in stochastic geometry as a natural and flexible yet analytically tractable model for hierarchical spatial cell-splitting and crack-formation processes. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe large scale asymptotic geometry of STIT <b>tessellations</b> in R^d and more generally that of non-stationary iteration infinitely divisible <b>tessellations.</b> We study several aspects of the typical first-order geometry of such <b>tessellations</b> resorting to martingale techniques as providing a direct link between the typical characteristics of STIT <b>tessellations</b> and those of suitable mixtures of Poisson hyperplane <b>tessellations.</b> Further, we also consider second-order properties of STIT and iteration infinitely divisible <b>tessellations,</b> such as the variance of the total surface area of cell boundaries inside a convex observation window. Our techniques, relying on martingale theory and tools from integral geometry, allow us to give explicit and asymptotic formulae. Based on these results, we establish a functional central limit theorem for the length/surface increment processes induced by STIT <b>tessellations.</b> We conclude a central limit theorem for total edge length/facet surface, with normal limit distribution in the planar case and non-normal ones in all higher dimensions.

5|$|A regular <b>tessellation</b> is {{a highly}} symmetric, {{edge-to-edge}} tiling made up of regular polygons, all of the same shape. There are only three regular tessellations: those made up of equilateral triangles, squares, or regular hexagons. All three of these tilings are isogonal and monohedral.|$|E
5|$|A semi-regular (or Archimedean) <b>tessellation</b> uses {{more than}} one type of regular polygon in an {{isogonal}} arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two). These can be described by their vertex configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.82 (each vertex has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. An edge <b>tessellation</b> {{is one in which}} each tile can be reflected over an edge to take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Centroidal Voronoi <b>tessellations</b> (CVTs) are Voronoi <b>tessellations</b> of a bounded {{geometric}} domain {{such that}} the generating points of the <b>tessellations</b> are also the centroids (mass centers) of the corresponding Voronoi regions {{with respect to a}} given density function. Centroidal Voronoi <b>tessellations</b> may also be defined in more abstract and more general settings. Due to the natural optimization properties enjoyed by CVTs, they have many applications in diverse fields. The Lloyd algorithm {{is one of the most}} popular iterative schemes for computing the CVTs but its theoretical analysis is far from complete.

5|$|A uniform {{honeycomb}} in hyperbolic {{space is}} a uniform <b>tessellation</b> of uniform polyhedral cells.

5|$|Any {{triangle}} or quadrilateral (even non-convex) {{can be used}} as a prototile to form a monohedral <b>tessellation,</b> {{often in}} more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary quadrilateral can form a <b>tessellation</b> with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a parallelogram subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.|$|E
5|$|Many {{other types}} of <b>tessellation</b> are {{possible}} under different constraints. For example, there are eight types of semi-regular <b>tessellation,</b> made {{with more than one}} kind of regular polygon but still having the same arrangement of polygons at every corner. Irregular tessellations can also be made from other shapes such as pentagons, polyominoes and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape. The artist M. C. Escher is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles, shaped like animals and other natural objects. If suitable contrasting colours are chosen for the tiles of differing shape, striking patterns are formed, and these can be used to decorate physical surfaces such as church floors.|$|E

5|$|<b>Tessellation</b> or tiling in two {{dimensions}} {{is a topic}} in geometry that studies how shapes, known as tiles, can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are {{that there must be}} no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another. The tessellations created by bonded brickwork do not obey this rule. Among those that do, a regular <b>tessellation</b> has both identical regular tiles and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile. There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral triangle, square, and regular hexagon. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a plane with no gaps.|$|E
