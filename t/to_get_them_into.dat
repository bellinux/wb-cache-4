Applications for Boston Housing Authority were being handed out and filled out and submitted. This is an attempt to enact by outreach the Housing First initiative, federally mandated.

2500|$|Beginning in 1858, various {{colonies of}} British North America started issuing their own coins {{denominated}} in cents, featuring {{the likeness of}} Queen Victoria on the obverse. [...] These replaced the sterling coins previously in circulation. [...] The Province of Canada {{was the first to}} [...] issue decimal coins. [...] They were based on the value of the American dollar, due to an influx of American silver. [...] Denominations issued were 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, and 20¢. The 1¢ coin was issued again in 1859, but it was very unpopular due to its extremely light weight. The coins had to be discounted by around 20% <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> circulation.

[...] While not rejecting that modern and commercial work should be included in modern art shows, Zakaria says, with The New Republic's Jed Perl, that the show fails to [...] "define a style or period" [...] and instead merely parrots current taste, giving the public validation. [...] Due to the overly dependent relationship with BMW, the show is driven by non-aesthetic criteria, and is too politically correct and uncontroversial. [...] Zakaria goes on to point out that, indeed, the Guggenheim gave up plans for a show [...] "Picasso and the Age of Iron" [...] because it was too old-fashioned to attract a sponsor, and that BMW turned down a request to sponsor a show [...] "Masterworks from Munich" [...] because Munich isn't sexy.|$|E

[...] Wham directed the soldiers' fire while his clerk rendered aid to the wounded. [...] Both men, initially unarmed, later took rifles from wounded soldiers and joined in the fight.

Trying {{to find a new}} assistant, Harry is forced to recruit the only applicant, Linda, an old work friend whose only entertainment skill is a poor dancing routine. Harry swallows his pride and contacts Karl, who agrees to enter the competition with him; although their reputation in the magic community is still strong enough <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> the tournament without an audition, the tensions between them ultimately prove too strong and they decide to go solo from that point on. As Harry and Linda rehearse their magic act, they begin to grow closer, but whilst Linda is open about her interest in Harry, he is too uptight and insecure to fully express his reciprocation. Much to his discomfort, Linda discovers the guillotine amongst his magic props and convinces him to use it as the centrepiece of the finale. Karl, meanwhile, is delighted to learn that Dani has come down from London to see him perform, but is slightly alarmed to discover that she believes him to be a genuine psychic. He nevertheless goes along with her belief, particularly as the interest in the competition has seen him approached by a television producer who wants to make him the centrepiece of a psychic show. Karl agrees to make his act for the finale a medium display, but begins to suffer a crisis of conscience. Karl tries a trick where he is buried in sand for a day.|$|E

Misa later looks at a photo of Light through her Shinigami eyes, to dispel any rumors of Light being alive. The trick with Light's voice is later applied against the Department of Death Note Prevention, lead by Tsukuru Mishima, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> a trap, which kills Matsuda. Later, the department learns that Light has furthered his DNA by procreating, and fathering a child, who was to be raised as the successor to Kira. However, the child and his guardian, Teru Mikami, both went insane from the Death Note given to them by Ryuk and Mikami wrote the child's name in the Death Note. The Death Note is picked up by Mishima, who is forced to kill Mikami. Mishima becomes attracted towards the Death Note, and secretly becomes Kira, under the nose of his fellow policemen. Mishima finds a video message from Light, meant for his son, alongside the Death Note, which he edits to make Kira's will, which is then sent to Shien. The video will demands that the 6 Death Notes which have fallen to Earth, be handed over to Kira. After the end credits, a previously unseen portion of Light's video is shown, in which he says, [...] "Just as I planned", and smiles ironically.|$|E

She is initially cool towards Don Draper, who bristles at her assertive, independent image, but they warm to each other and eventually begin an affair. In the course of their affair, Don tells her things he has not shared with Midge Daniels (his previous mistress) or his wife. When Don is blackmailed by Pete Campbell, he comes to Rachel with the suggestion that they run away together to Los Angeles. She reminds him of his duty to his children and questions whether he would want to abandon his children after having grown up without a father. When Don persists, Rachel comes to the realization that he didn't want to run away with her, he simply wanted to run away. Ironically, her calling him a coward and urging him to think more clearly inspires him to persuade Pete to stand down. The relationship seems to collapse from that point on, and Cooper complains to Don about how upset he has made her. Don and Rachel end the affair at some point {{between the first and second}} seasons. He encounters her again in Season 2 while out to eat with Bobbie Barrett, finding out that Rachel has moved on and married a man named Tilden Katz.
