5|$|At {{culturally}} conservative BYU, Romney remained {{isolated from}} much of <b>the</b> <b>upheaval</b> of that era.

During his senior year, he took a leave of absence to work as driver and advance man for eventually unsuccessful Senate campaign of his mother, Lenore Romney; together, they visited all 83Michigan counties. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in English with highest honors in 1971, giving commencement addresses to both the College of Humanities and to the whole of BYU.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name St Kilda {{is a matter of}} conjecture. The islands' human {{heritage}} includes numerous unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods, although the earliest written records of island life date from the Late Middle Ages. The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century, but illnesses brought by increased external contacts through tourism, and <b>the</b> <b>upheaval</b> of the First World War contributed to the island's evacuation in 1930. The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations, including Michael Powell's film The Edge of the World and an opera.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>upheaval</b> on shore, {{the arrival}} of the British {{blockade}} squadron provoked Renaud into taking action. Although the defences of Île de France were well prepared under Malartic's orders, food supplies were running low, with only rice still available in quantity. The potential for famine and consequent social unrest among the slave population was severe and Renaud sailed immediately to intercept Centurion and Diomede. The French squadron comprised the 40-gun frigate Cybèle under Captain Pierre Tréhouart, the 36-gun Prudente under Renaud, and the 14-gun brig Coureur under lieutenant de vaisseau Garaud. The 20-gun privateer corvettes Jean-Bart and Rosalie, as well as the aviso Sans-Culotte, accompanied the two frigates. The ships' crews were heavily augmented by volunteers, including a young Robert Surcouf on Cybèle, as well as a detachment of soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Finishing 18th in the Premier League {{resulted}} in relegation to the Championship {{for the following}} season. The Norwich City board announced shortly after relegation was confirmed on 11 May 2014 that a new manager would be announced within the week. On 22 May 2014, Neil Adams was named as the permanent manager despite the relegation from this season and four defeats in five matches as caretaker manager. <b>The</b> <b>upheaval</b> at the club {{was not limited to}} change in the management team, with a number of first team players being linked to moves away from Carrow Road, including Robert Snodgrass, Gary Hooper and John Ruddy. Chairman Alan Bowkett responded to the reports by stating that the club would be under no pressure to sell players during the transfer window.|$|E
5|$|Slavery was not {{abolished}} {{even after}} the Thirteenth Amendment. There were four million freedmen {{and most of them}} on the same plantation, doing the same work that they did before emancipation, except as their work had been interrupted and changed by <b>the</b> <b>upheaval</b> of war. Moreover, they were getting about the same wages and apparently were going to be subject to slave codes modified only in name. There were among them thousands of fugitives in the camps of the soldiers or {{on the streets of the}} cities, homeless, sick, and impoverished. They had been freed practically with no land nor money, and, save in exceptional cases, without legal status, and without protection.|$|E

5|$|After usurping {{the throne}} of the Later Zhou dynasty, Emperor Taizu of Song (r. 960–976) spent sixteen years conquering the rest of China, reuniting much of the {{territory}} that had once belonged to the Han and Tang empires and ending <b>the</b> <b>upheaval</b> of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. In Kaifeng, he established a strong central government over the empire. He ensured administrative stability by promoting the civil service examination system of drafting state bureaucrats by skill and merit (instead of aristocratic or military position) and promoted projects that ensured efficiency in communication throughout the empire. In one such project, cartographers created detailed maps of each province and city that were then collected in a large atlas. Emperor Taizu also promoted groundbreaking scientific and technological innovations by supporting such works as the astronomical clock tower designed and built by the engineer Zhang Sixun.|$|E
5|$|In {{a prelude}} to the Carnation Revolution, {{in the early morning}} of 16 March 1974, the Fifth Infantry Regiment (Regimento de Infantaria 5), based in Caldas da Rainha in what is now the School of Army Sergeants (Escola de Sargentos do Exército), {{attempted}} to stage a coup d'état against the country's authoritarian Estado Novo regime. Thirty officers and about 300 sergeants and enlisted men from the regiment left their quarters at 4:00a.m., heading for Lisbon, where they planned to occupy the airport. On approaching the capital, the Caldas regiment found themselves alone, realizing that the other units supposed to participate in the coup had not joined <b>the</b> <b>upheaval.</b> The regiment turned back and reached their Caldas quarters at around 10:00a.m., locking themselves in and awaiting a siege. The compound was surrounded by various forces, which penetrated the base at about 5:00p.m. The revolters were arrested and sent to various military prisons, where they were held until the Carnation Revolution on 25 April 1974, 40 days later.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of <b>the</b> <b>upheaval,</b> the new Palladium had opened. The Senators, still coached by Allison, lost their opening game in the arena 3–0 to Montreal on January 17, 1996. The event was much more subdued than their franchise's first game. The Cup banners were raised, but the winches jammed, {{blocking}} {{the view of many}} fans. There were no entertainment big names, and only Firestone and Bryden participated in the ceremonial face-off. The club would lose its first four games at the Palladium, winning none for Allison, who was later fired on January 24 after the team lost 22 of 25 games. While Ottawa finished last in the League for the fourth year in a row, the 1995–96 season ended with renewed optimism, partly from the debut of new star Daniel Alfredsson, who won the Calder Trophy, the NHL rookie of the year award, the first Senator to do so. Alfredsson, selected 133rd overall in 1994, was also selected to play in the 1996 NHL All-Star Game.|$|E

5|$|Realizing {{the need}} for new leadership, in {{what became known as the}} Polish October, the Politburo chose Gomułka, who had been {{released}} from prison and reinstated in the party, and the Central Committee's 8th Plenum elected him without a Soviet approval the new first secretary of the PZPR. Subsequently, Gomułka convinced the Soviet leaders that he would preserve the Soviet influence in Poland. Gomułka's elevation was preceded by ominous Soviet military moves and an arrival of Soviet high-level delegation led by Khrushchev, which flew into Warsaw to witness and influence <b>the</b> <b>upheaval</b> in the Polish party. After the sometimes confrontational encounters and negotiations, they soon returned to Moscow, where the Soviet leader announced on 21 October that the idea of an armed intervention in Poland should be abandoned. This position was soon reinforced by the pressure from communist China, which expressed its great power aspirations and demanded that the Soviets leave the new Polish leadership alone. On 21 October in Warsaw Gomułka's return to power was accomplished, giving rise to the era of national communism in Poland. Gomułka pledged to dismantle Stalinism and in his acceptance speech raised numerous social democratic-sounding reformist ideas, giving hope to the left-wing revisionists and others in Polish society that the communist state was, after all, reformable. The revisionists replaced and claimed to represent the worker movement, recently defeated in Poznań. The main goals in pursuit of which they engaged were political freedom and self-management in state enterprises. However, the end of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe was nowhere in sight. On 14 May 1955, the Warsaw Pact was signed in the Polish capital, to counteract the earlier establishment of NATO.|$|E
