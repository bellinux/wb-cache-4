5|$|Bamber first sought {{leave to}} appeal in November 1986, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> had {{misdirected}} the jury. The application was heard and refused by a single judge in April 1988. Bamber's lawyer requested a full hearing before three judges, arguing that the trial judge's summing up had been biased against Bamber, that his language had been too forceful, {{and that he had}} undermined the defence by advancing his own theory. The lawyer also argued that the defence had not pressed Julie Mugford about her dealings with the media, but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers. The judges rejected the application in March 1989.|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{evidence}} on the package eventually leads to Bardale, and then to The Judge. The Judge is arrested for questioning, and knowing {{that there is not}} enough evidence to warrant sentencing him, he offers Black a job with him. Black refuses, but The Judge is released. Bardale is incensed <b>that</b> <b>The</b> <b>Judge</b> has manipulated the law to his own ends, and passes sentence on him for hypocrisy. Finding Bardale alone in a farmhouse, Black discovers that the convict had fed The Judge to his pigs.|$|E
5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a miscarriage of justice, since {{he did not have}} legal representation. He argued that he should have been provided with counsel at public expense, given the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, he argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.|$|E

50|$|The oral {{presentation}} {{has a similar}} rubric as the written portion. The variation here is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> look over <b>the</b> rubric before the presentation, and do not fill out the scores until the students have left. There are generally 6 sections <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> evaluate, each being worth 0-9 points, with the total score worth 40 out of the total 100 points.|$|R
5|$|Farmer's wife Rebecca {{filed for}} divorce on April 5, 2011, {{claiming}} in court documents {{that she had no}} access to the family's finances except the salary she earned as a teacher's aide. On April 12, Farmer petitioned the court to dismiss his wife's divorce petition, contesting the idea that their marriage was irretrievably broken. The divorce proceedings were put on hold by mutual consent on May 26, 2011, but in a July 12 hearing, Farmer's wife asked <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> schedule a trial date; the judge ordered mediation within 30 days instead. The mediation failed, and a trial date was set for November 22, shortly after the gubernatorial election. A second round of mediation shortly before the scheduled hearing resulted in a settlement between the parties; terms of the settlement were kept private.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{was accused}} (in a lawsuit brought by Mona Brewer against Earl Paulk of Chapel Hill Harvester Church) of using {{money from a}} $125 million green space bond sale to {{purchase}} a Decatur, GA church building from Paulk for $2.4 million, a sum claimed to be unjustifiably {{in excess of the}} land's actual value. The County made no use of the property, and was the building was later leased to a start-up cable network for a token sum of a dollar per year. During the ensuing court case, the plaintiff alleged that, as part of a questionable relationship, Paulk arranged for a sexual encounter between Jones and one of Paulk's former mistresses. When deposed, Jones refused to answer questions relating to that incident, {{as well as a number}} of other questions involving his dealings with Paulk. That case was ultimately withdrawn by the plaintiff's attorney, Louis Levenson, who felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> in the case was biased against his client. The case was subsequently refiled and drew a different judge.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 1990, U.S. District Judge Thomas Rutherford Brett {{dismissed}} {{seven of}} the nine claims before him, and on March 24, the plaintiffs filed a motion to drop the two remaining claims in hopes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> would reconsider the claims already dismissed. The plaintiffs also filed for a restraining order to halt construction activities. In support of their filings, the turnpike opponents alleged that OTA was illegally dumping material into waterways. OTA responded by producing U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) documentation showing that no illegal discharge had taken place, and that USACE had not issued any cease and desist orders due to unlawful activity. OTA argued that the plaintiffs' requests for a restraining order and reconsideration of the dismissed claims were invalid {{because there was no}} change in their legal authority or the facts surrounding the case to warrant such a reconsideration.|$|E

40|$|The Article 80 of the Japanese Constitution prescribes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> of <b>the</b> {{inferior}} courts {{shall be}} {{appointed by the}} Cabinet {{from a list of}} persons nominated by the Supreme Court and all such judges shall hold office for a term of ten years with a privilege of reappointment. This article was presumably mabe on <b>the</b> ground <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> should be also subject to a certain democratic control of the people like the elected representatives. It permits the reappointment of <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> on <b>that</b> ground and lays down the same precedure of appointment as on the case of the first appointment. But if the reappointment of <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> is left to the discretion of the Supreme Court, it is feared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> to be reappointed will be threatened under the uncertainly of their positions and will be devoid of independence in the exercise of the power. How should this article of reappointment be interpreted that some insist to aim at removing <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> lack of ability. We support <b>the</b> interpretation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> shall be reappointed as a general rule on <b>the</b> reason <b>that</b> <b>the</b> principle of Judicial Independence is prior to the removal of incapable judges. On this ground, the power of nomination <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court has must be restricted according to the privilege of reappointment held by all such judges...|$|R

If the parties choose to proceed on with the claim without any objections to the judge, {{it stands to reason that}} a court will infer a waiver to the accusation of bias if either party had not raised an objection to bias at the commencement of a suit or at any time during it, following the approach taken by Locabail which was applied by the Federal Court of Malaysia in M. G. G. Pillai v. Tan Sri Dato' Vincent Tan Chee Yioun (2002).|$|E

25|$|There is a {{risk that}} if the real {{likelihood}} test is applied, the court appears to be determining {{that it is possible}} or likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> was biased.
