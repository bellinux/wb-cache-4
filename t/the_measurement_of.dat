5|$|A {{number of}} tests {{that can be used}} to test the {{function}} of the thyroid, for the presence of diseases, and for the success or failure of treatment. Blood tests in general aim to measure thyroid function or determine the cause of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid function tests include a battery of blood tests including <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, as well as <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> TSH. They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).|$|E

5|$|In 1865 the {{triangulation}} of Spain was {{connected with}} that of Portugal and France. In 1866 {{at the conference}} of the Association of Geodesy in Neuchâtel, Ibáñez announced that Spain would collaborate in remeasuring the French meridian arc. In 1879 Ibáñez and François Perrier (representing France) completed the junction between the geodetic network of Spain and Algeria and thus completed <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the French meridian arc which extended from Shetland to the Sahara.|$|E
5|$|In a 1905 paper, Einstein {{postulated}} that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta). Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> Compton scattering.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the oldest}} fields in astronomy, and in all of science, is <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the {{positions}} of celestial objects.

5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the spectrographic {{features}} of this star showed the characteristic absorption line shift of a binary star system. This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a doppler shift in the wavelength of the line features. <b>The</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> this shift allows astronomers to determine the relative orbital velocity {{of at least one}} of the stars even though they are unable to resolve the individual components.|$|E

5|$|Luminous {{infrared}} galaxies or LIRGs are galaxies with luminosities, <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> brightness, above 1011 L☉. LIRGs {{are more}} abundant than starburst galaxies, Seyfert galaxies and quasi-stellar objects at comparable total luminosity. Infrared galaxies emit more {{energy in the}} infrared than at all other wavelengths combined. A LIRG's luminosity is 100 billion times that of our Sun.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{presents}} two spectrophotometric {{absorption bands}} peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760nm. Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize {{plant health status}} from a satellite platform. This approach exploits {{the fact that in}} those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.|$|E
5|$|Sustainability {{measurement}} is a {{term that}} denotes the measurements used as the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability. The metrics used for <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> sustainability (involving the sustainability of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are evolving: they include indicators, benchmarks, audits, sustainability standards and certification systems like Fairtrade and Organic, indexes and accounting, as well as assessment, appraisal and other reporting systems. They are applied {{over a wide range}} of spatial and temporal scales.|$|E

5|$|The main {{residual}} {{uncertainty in the}} early measurements was in <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the isotopic composition of the silicon to calculate the atomic weight, so in 2007 a 4.8kg single crystal of isotopically-enriched silicon (99.94% 28Si) was grown, and two one-kilogram spheres cut from it. Diameter measurements on the spheres are repeatable to within 0.3nm, and the uncertainty in the mass is 3µg. Full results from these determinations were expected in late 2010.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> stellar {{parallax}} {{of nearby}} stars provides a fundamental baseline in the cosmic distance ladder {{that is used}} to measure the scale of the Universe. Parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can be compared. Measurements of the radial velocity and proper motion of stars allows astronomers to plot the movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy. Astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of speculated dark matter in the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|The {{measurements}} use highly polished {{spheres of}} silicon {{with a mass}} of one kilogram. Spheres are used to simplify <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the size (and hence the density) and to minimize {{the effect of the}} oxide coating that inevitably forms on the surface. The first measurements used spheres of silicon with natural isotopic composition, and had a relative uncertainty of 3.1. These first results were also inconsistent with values of the Planck constant derived from watt balance measurements, although the source of the discrepancy is now believed to be known.|$|E
