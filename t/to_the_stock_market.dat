25|$|The chart at {{the right}} shows the year-to-year {{portfolio}} balances after taking $35,000 (and adjusting for inflation) from a $750,000 portfolio every year for 30 years, starting in 1973 (red line), 1974 (blue line), or 1975 (green line). While the overall market conditions and inflation affected all three about the same (since all three experienced exactly the same conditions between 1975 and 2003), the chance of making the funds last for 30 years depended heavily on what happened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> {{in the first few}} years.|$|E
25|$|During the 1920s, {{the nation}} enjoyed {{widespread}} prosperity, albeit with a weakness in agriculture. A financial bubble {{was fueled by}} an inflated stock market, which later led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>Market</b> Crash on October 29, 1929. This, {{along with many other}} economic factors, triggered a worldwide depression known as the Great Depression. During this time, the United States experienced deflation as prices fell, unemployment soared from 3% in 1929 to 25% in 1933, farm prices fell by half, and manufacturing output plunged by one-third.|$|E

In the original design, additional buildings were supposed to be attached to the existing building, but they were never built due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> crash in late 1929. For instance, there was to be a hotel attached to the north side of the building. In its earliest days, the theatre specialized in silent films and live vaudevillian performances.|$|E

2500|$|All was {{not easy}} and as a {{director}} of the Sovereign Bank in Canada that fell victim <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> crash of 1907, he experienced severe financial difficulties. Added to this, mismanagement kept hidden by the officers running his Montreal brokerage house, one of whom committed suicide when his discrepancies were revealed, caused Dunn more financial grief. In 1913, his partner Fischer disappeared and went to ground leaving him with monstrous debts, as their firm was a partnership, not a limited liability vehicle, but he managed courageously and with help from his creditors to cover them all. Nine years later, Dunn forgave Fischer when the latter was [...] "in virtual destitution", {{even to the point of}} giving him a job.|$|E

2500|$|In 1915, Scott {{moved to}} Twentynine Palms, {{where he lived}} quietly until Johnson decided to visit him. [...] Johnson {{eventually}} forgave Scott for his fraudulent scheming, and the two became friends. Johnson soon purchased the Staininger Ranch in Grapevine Canyon for his own use, and in 1929, prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> crash, began developing the property of what later became Lower Vine Ranch, approximately five miles away. Although Johnson had originally installed quarters for Scotty at Grapevine, he also built a roomy five-room cabin for Scott at Lower Vine {{as well as several}} outbuildings and a corral for Scott's beloved mules. Johnson also used the land at Lower Vine for a short while to farm alfalfa so he could legally claim the property for himself under the Homesteading Act. [...] Scott immediately returned to his old ways of spreading unbelievable tales about his mine, which Johnson did nothing to discourage, regarding it as merely amusement.|$|E

Wealth was to be obtained instantly, without labor and without stint. The upper classes were as base in their venality as the lower. The highest and most powerful nobles, abandoning all generous pursuits and lofty aims, engaged in the vile scuffle for gam. They were even baser than the lower classes; for some of them, {{who were members of}} the council of the regency, abused their station and their influence, and promoted measures by which shares rose while in their hands, and they made immense profits.|$|E
