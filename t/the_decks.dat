5|$|Despite these additions, {{the ship}} was still felt to be too {{vulnerable}} to plunging fire and Renown was refitted in Rosyth between 1 February and mid-April 1917 with additional horizontal armour, weighing approximately , added to <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> over the magazines and over the steering gear. Flying-off platforms were fitted on 'B' and 'X' turrets in early 1918. One fighter and a reconnaissance aircraft were carried.|$|E
50|$|Before {{performing}} the trick, the magician notes the bottom card of <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> When <b>the</b> selection {{is returned to}} <b>the</b> <b>deck,</b> <b>the</b> magician has it placed on top and gives <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> a cut, placing the card he noted above the selection. While dealing through <b>the</b> <b>deck,</b> <b>the</b> magician knows that the card after the one he noted (the original bottom card of <b>the</b> <b>deck)</b> is <b>the</b> selection. The rest is showmanship.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>deck</b> stack is {{considered}} cyclic as any card in <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> {{can be used}} to determine the value and position of any other card in <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> <b>The</b> bottom card of <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> is in order with the top card of <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> making <b>the</b> order of cards an endlessly repeating cycle. A deck in Si Stebbins order can be cut any number of times without disturbing the order.|$|R

5|$|Despite these additions, {{the ship}} was still felt to be too {{vulnerable}} to plunging fire and Repulse was refitted in Rosyth between 10 November 1916 and 29 January 1917 with additional horizontal armour, weighing approximately , added to <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> over the magazines and over the steering gear. Repulse was the first capital ship fitted with a flying-off platform when an experimental one was fitted on 'B' turret {{in the autumn of}} 1917. Squadron Leader Frederick Rutland took off in a Sopwith Pup on 1 October. Another platform was built on 'Y' turret and Rutland successfully took off from it on 8 October. One fighter and a reconnaissance aircraft were normally carried.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{assessments}} of Belfasts damage showed that, while the mine had done little direct {{damage to the}} outer hull, causing only a small hole directly below one of the boiler rooms, {{the shock of the}} explosion had caused severe warping, breaking machinery, deforming <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> and causing the keel to hog (bend upwards) by three inches. On 4 January 1940 Belfast was decommissioned to Care and Maintenance status, becoming the responsibility of Rosyth Dockyard, and her crew dispersed to other vessels. By 28 June she had been repaired sufficiently to sail to Devonport, arriving on 30 June under the command of Lt Cdr H W Parkinson.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March 1868, {{parties of}} Paraguayans in canoes camouflaged by foliage and brush boarded Brazilian ironclads {{anchored}} in Tayí. The imperiled vessels dispatched a boat to warn Inhaúma, who was aboard the flagship Brasil downriver at Elisiário Port. By {{the time he}} arrived, the Brazilians had locked themselves inside their ships and the Paraguayans had taken control of <b>the</b> <b>decks.</b> Inhaúma ordered the Brasil and two other vessels to open fire, decimating the Paraguayans and saving the ironclads. A day later he was raised from baron to viscount by Pedro II. On 25 July, the allies occupied Humaitá after the Paraguayans had abandoned it and retreated further upriver.|$|E

25|$|Compartments are {{identified}} by <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> forming <b>the</b> floor of that compartment. Different types of ships have different deck naming conventions. Passenger ships often use {{letters of the}} alphabet sequentially down from A <b>deck</b> (<b>the</b> highest) above B deck, and B deck above C deck, and so forth. Another popular naming convention is numbering <b>the</b> main <b>deck</b> 1, <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> below it 2 (or <b>the</b> second <b>deck),</b> and <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> below that <b>the</b> third <b>deck,</b> and so forth. <b>Decks</b> above <b>the</b> main <b>deck</b> may be named, like <b>the</b> bridge <b>deck</b> or poop deck, or they may be numbered upwards from <b>the</b> main <b>deck</b> with a zero prefix: 01 above <b>the</b> main <b>deck,</b> 02 deck above 01, and so forth.|$|R

5|$|On 7 October 1800, off Sand Heads, near Calcutta, Confiance met the 40-gun East Indiaman Kent, of 824tons burthen, under Captain Robert Rivington. Kent had rescued {{the crew}} of another ship, the Queen, {{destroyed}} by fire, and therefore had an exceptionally large complement of 437 men, including her passengers; 300 of them were soldiers and sailors; Surcouf managed to board his larger opponent and, after over {{an hour and a}} half of battle across <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> of the ship, seize control of the Kent.|$|E
5|$|The Apache was {{a valued}} form of {{close air support}} in the {{conflict}} in Afghanistan, being deployed to the region in 2006. The Apache has been an object of controversy over the fitting of some weapons, such as cluster munitions. Naval trials and temporary deployments at sea have proven the aircraft as an able platform to operate from <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> of ships, which is a unique application of the Apache amongst its operators. British Apaches served in the NATO 2011 military intervention in Libya operating from Royal Navy ships.|$|E
5|$|The carrier's crew {{suffered}} 811 fatalities, mainly {{among the}} aircraft mechanics and armorers stationed on the hangar decks and the ship's engineers, {{many of whom}} were trapped below in the boiler and engine rooms by uncontrolled fires raging on <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> above them. Twenty-one of the ship's aviators were killed. The loss of Kaga and the three other IJN carriers at Midway (Hiryū was also sunk during the battle), with their aircraft and veteran pilots, was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan's ultimate defeat in the war.|$|E

50|$|For {{a time in}} {{the later}} 1990s, the {{sections}} of <b>the</b> parking <b>deck</b> were also known by the adjacent road. <b>The</b> then-Green <b>Deck</b> was known as the Glenwood Deck; <b>the</b> Red <b>Deck,</b> <b>the</b> Blue Ridge Deck; and <b>the</b> Gold <b>Deck,</b> <b>the</b> Creedmoor <b>Deck.</b>|$|R
50|$|To load {{vehicles}} on <b>the</b> top <b>deck</b> of a double-decker commercial trailer, the rear half of <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> can tilt and be lowered hydraulically, forming a drive-up ramp to <b>the</b> upper <b>deck.</b> <b>The</b> top <b>deck</b> is usually loaded first and off-loaded last, since {{the presence of}} cars on <b>the</b> lower <b>deck</b> can {{make it impossible to}} lower <b>the</b> top <b>deck</b> ramp.|$|R
5|$|The first {{seaplanes}} used in combat, {{supplied by}} French manufacturer Donnet-Lévêque, were operated from Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand {{and her two}} sisters during the blockade. However, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was {{not satisfied with the}} operation, as the ships lacked enough deck space for the planes, as well as a lack of cranes with which they could easily hoist the planes onto <b>the</b> <b>decks.</b> The planes were later moved to a hangar at the navy yard in Teodo. By 1913, the four new dreadnoughts of the —the only dreadnoughts built for the fleet—were coming into active service. With the commissioning of these dreadnoughts, the navy shifted Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and her sisters to the 2nd Division of the 1st Battle Squadron.|$|E
5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of <b>the</b> <b>decks,</b> and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{official}} armament plan Kronan was to be equipped with 124–126guns; 34–36guns {{on each of the}} gundecks and an additional 18 shared between forecastle and sterncastle decks. Guns were classed by the weight of the cannonballs they fired, varying between 3 and 36pounds (1.3–15.3kg). The guns themselves weighed from a few hundred kg (400–500lbs) up to four tonnes (4.4 tons) with the heaviest pieces placed {{in the middle of the}} lower-most gundeck with successively lighter ones on <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> above. Kronans most lethal weapons were the 30- and 36-pounders on the lowest gundeck which had a range and firepower that outclassed the armament of almost any other warship. The guns lighter than 18-pounders were primarily intended to inflict damage on the enemy's crew and rigging rather than the hull.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>deck</b> is not {{composed}} {{of an even}} distribution of face-values. For example, {{there is only one}} card in <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> with face-value of four, and likewise for face-value of 12.

5|$|After Point Grey and Point Orient {{were turned}} over to the RVN on 14 July only Point Cypress and Point Marone were left in Division 13. On that day the {{remaining}} two cutters were given orders to report to the lower Mekong Delta and provide support for operations in the Than Phu Secret Zone. On 19 and 20 July the crews of both cutters consisted of a full complement of 13 RVN sailors and 5 Coast Guardsmen including the commanding officers. Kit Carson Scouts were also embarked, making <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> very crowded. The Scouts were put ashore on a search and destroy mission and the cutters backed them up with gunfire from their decks and the cutter small boats. The raid was successful, netting several captured Viet Cong troops and boxes of documents. A week later both cutters with Australian Army explosive ordnance disposal soldiers aboard cruised the My Thanh River and destroyed fortifications.|$|E
5|$|At 02:45, Amethyst {{was able}} to pull across the bows of Niémen, inflicting a devastating raking fire on the French ship which caused terrible damage. Niémen surged forward into Amethyst, but the {{collision}} caused little damage and at 03:00 Amethyst again raked her opponent, this time from the east. The frigates were so close that shot from Amethyst started fires among Niémens hammock netting, placed along <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> to deter boarding actions. At 03:15, Niémens mizenmast and main topmast collapsed and another fire {{broke out in the}} main top, but Amethyst was also severely damaged and at 03:30 her mainmast fell onto the deck from a combination of shot damage and stress in high winds. Niémens mainmast also collapsed a few minutes later. Both frigates had stopped firing at 03:25, as the confusion on their decks was brought under control.|$|E
5|$|At 4:00 am on 25 August, {{the newly}} erected French gun battery {{opened fire on}} Sirius and Iphigenia, which {{returned}} fire as best they could. Accepting that Sirius was beyond repair, Pym removed all her personnel and military supplies, setting fire to the frigate at 9:00 am, shortly after Iphigenia had pulled beyond {{the range of the}} battery, using a cannon as an anchor after losing hers the previous day. French boats attempted to reach Sirius and capture her before she exploded, although they turned back when Pym launched his own boats to contest possession of the wreck. The frigate's remaining munitions exploded at 11:00 am. During the morning, Duperré sent an official boarding party aboard Nereide, who wet <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> to prevent any risk of fire from the ships burning in the harbour and removed 75 corpses from the frigate.|$|E

5|$|Commander Alfred Godsal led {{the assault}} in HMS Brilliant {{and it was}} he who {{stumbled}} into the most effective German counter-measure first. As Brilliant staggered through the murk, the lookout spotted the buoy ahead and Godsal headed directly for it, coming under even heavier fire as he did so. Passing the navigation marker at speed, the cruiser was suddenly brought to a halt with a juddering lurch, throwing men to <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> and sticking fast in deep mud well outside the harbour mouth. Before warnings could be relayed to the Sirius following up close behind, she too passed the buoy and her captain Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy was shocked to see Brilliant dead ahead. With no time to manoeuvree, Sirius ploughed into the port quarter of Brilliant, the blockships settling into the mud in a tangle of wreckage.|$|E
5|$|For {{those who}} were not injured or killed {{outright}} by moving objects, there was little time to reach safety, especially for the men who were manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies in the hold. The companionways that connected <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the midsection of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed to get up from below deck were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.|$|E
5|$|In April 1965, Yancey {{was ordered}} to the Dominican Republic to support Operation Power Pack, the code name for the United States' {{intervention}} in the Dominican Republic. The attack cargo ship arrived at Santo Domingo, the capital city, on 30 April. Yancey loaded nearly 600 evacuees from 21 nations. Among those on board the ship were the daughter of William Tapley Bennett Jr., the United States Ambassador to the Dominican Republic; the Belgian Ambassador to the Dominican Republic; sixteen nuns from the Dominican Order; and several large families. Yanceys officers and crew vacated their quarters to allow room for female passengers and children, and many slept on <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> of the ship during the passage to San Juan, Puerto Rico. One of the passengers gave birth during the short trip, and gave her son the middle name of Yancey {{in honor of the}} ship.|$|E
