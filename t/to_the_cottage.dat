5|$|During {{a welcome}} dinner at Barton Park, Sir John {{introduces}} the Dashwoods to his wife, Lady Middleton (Rosanna Lavelle); her mother, Mrs. Jennings (Linda Bassett); {{and their family}} friend, Colonel Brandon (David Morrissey). Brandon instantly {{falls in love with}} Marianne, but she believes he is too old for her. While out walking with Margaret, Marianne falls and twists her ankle. She is rescued by a young man, who carries her back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage.</b> He introduces himself as John Willoughby (Dominic Cooper), and states that he will return to check on Marianne the following day. Brandon also comes to visit, but upon seeing Willoughby, he quickly departs. Willoughby and Marianne grow close through their mutual love of poetry, and he later takes a lock of her hair. Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor begin to speculate on whether they have become secretly engaged.|$|E
5|$|In 19th Century Russia, Vladimir Durfe (Mark Damon) {{is a young}} nobleman {{who finds}} a {{beheaded}} corpse with a knife plunged into its heart. He takes the blade, and finds shelter in a small cottage. Durfe is approached by Giorgio (Glauco Onorato) who explains that the knife belongs to his father, {{who has not been}} seen for five days. Giorgio offers a room to Durfe and introduces him {{to the rest of the}} family: his wife (Rika Dialina), their young son Ivan, Giorgio's younger brother Pietro (Massimo Righi), and sister Sdenka (Susy Andersen). They all await the return of Gorca, who has gone to fight the wurdalak, a living cadaver who feeds on human blood, especially of close friends and family members. At midnight, Gorca (Boris Karloff) returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> with a sour demeanor and unkempt appearance. After the family goes to sleep, Ivan and Pietro are attacked by Gorca who flees the cottage with Ivan. Giorgio chases after Gorca but only returns with Ivan's corpse. Giorgio plans to stake and behead Ivan to prevent him from reviving as a Wurdalak, but is prevented from doing so by his wife. The two agree to give their son a burial.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, {{with the}} project still unfinished, the museum {{published}} a report examining {{the reasons for the}} delay and additional cost. It found that the museum had greatly underestimated the work required due to the poor condition of the locomotive, much of which had been missed by a rushed inspection, which produced an overly optimistic assessment which was not based on engineering realities. It also found that once the project was underway, management lacked the experience, continuity or resources to undertake such a complex task, which was also hampered by illness and recruitment issues. Although the museum had a formal contract system to manage suppliers, managers failed to implement it properly, and it was ill-suited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> industry nature of the heritage railway sector which the suppliers were largely drawn from, many of whom had failed to meet their contractual targets. Problems were also caused by the conflicting objectives of producing a certified main line locomotive while retaining as many original components and assemblies as possible, and between the need to overhaul the locomotive {{and use it as a}} marketing tool for the museum. The report recommended that the NRM consider the scope, size and responsibilities of their project management and engineering functions, and their contracting policy.|$|E
40|$|Sandy Neck’s {{barrier beach}} in Barnstable, Massachusetts {{provides}} critical habitats for piping plovers and other threatened species listed by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Massachusetts Endangered Species Act (MESA). <b>To</b> protect <b>the</b> species, the Town must regulate vehicle access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beach and <b>the</b> nearby <b>cottages.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cottage</b> owners assert that <b>the</b> regulations amount <b>to</b> a regulatory taking of their access rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages.</b> This Note proposes alternatives for <b>the</b> Town <b>to</b> protect <b>the</b> threatened species, without working a taking of <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> owners’ access rights, recommending that the Town apply for an incidental take permit under ESA, eliminate restrictions on guest access, and hire additional pilots to guide cottage owners around piping plovers on <b>the</b> trails leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages...</b>|$|R

50|$|Before the {{erection}} of Bishop Hall, {{the original}} system {{of living for}} the women of Miami University consisted of two <b>cottages.</b> <b>The</b> women affiliated with Sororities attempted to live off campus {{in order to provide}} more living space for unaffiliated women, but returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> after one year. There was a “pressing need for more accommodations for women” and many “inconveniences of <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> system”.|$|R
50|$|In 1879, an {{artesian}} well water system was installed, providing spring water <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages.</b> However, <b>the</b> pipes were laid very shallowly, {{and had to}} be drained in <b>the</b> winter months <b>to</b> prevent freezing. Then, as now, the community closed from November through April, during which time the residences must be vacated.|$|R

25|$|Staying in Palestine until August 1945, Koestler {{collected}} {{material for}} his next novel, Thieves in the Night. When he returned to England Mamaine Paget, whom he had started to see before going out to Palestine, was waiting for him. In 1945 August the couple moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> of Bwlch Ocyn, a secluded farmhouse that belonged to Clough Williams-Ellis, in the Vale of Ffestiniog. Over {{the next three years}} Koestler would become a close friend of George Orwell. The region had its own intellectual circle, which would have been sympathetic to Koestler: Williams-Ellis' wife, Amabel, a niece of Lytton Strachey was also a former communist; other associates included Rupert Crawshay-Williams, Michael Polanyi, Storm Jameson and, most significantly, Bertrand Russell, who lived {{just a few miles from}} the Koestler cottage.|$|E

500|$|The {{interior}} features {{many of the}} cottage's original details including mantels, woodwork and built-in cabinets. [...] There is an arched opening {{between the}} former dining and living rooms. [...] A large room, which features the same design and materials as the original portion and {{is located at the}} rear of the building, is believed to be a later addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} surrounds {{a courtyard}} {{with a large}} reflecting pool. The classrooms are oriented outward, to provide views of the surrounding forest. There are no interior passages {{in this part of}} the building; each class area has an exit to the outside, and students pass between rooms via the covered cloister, even in inclement weather. The design is meant to reinforce the [...] "home and school" [...] atmosphere that dates back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cottage</b> School, with child-sized classrooms, ten working fireplaces, draperies, and other home-like details.|$|E
500|$|The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge {{rented the}} cottage {{for three years}} from 1797. As well as writing poetry he was a {{literary}} critic and philosopher who, with his friend William Wordsworth, was {{a founder of the}} Romantic Movement in England {{and a member of the}} Lake Poets. It was while he was living in Nether Stowey that Coleridge wrote This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, part of Christabel, and Frost at Midnight. While writing , Coleridge was said to have been interrupted by the arrival of a [...] "Person from Porlock". It is unclear whether this really happened or was part of a dream but has become a literary allusion for unwanted intruders who disrupt inspired creativity. During Coleridge's time at the house William Wordsworth visited him and subsequently rented Alfoxton Park, a little over [...] away. There are references <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> in several of Coleridge's poems, including To The Rev G Coleridge (lines 52–61), This Lime Tree Bower My Prison; Frost at Midnight; and Fears in Solitude (lines 221–226).|$|E

500|$|In June 1890, Harrison's Postmaster General John Wanamaker {{and several}} Philadelphia friends {{purchased}} a large new cottage at Cape May Point for Harrison's wife Caroline. Many believed <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> gift appeared <b>to</b> be improper and {{amounted to a}} bribe for a cabinet position. [...] Harrison made no comment on the matter until after two weeks {{when he said he}} had always intended <b>to</b> purchase <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> once Caroline gave approval.

500|$|Meanwhile, the Queen {{discovers that}} Snow White {{is still alive}} when the mirror again answers that Snow White is the fairest in the land and reveals that the heart in the jeweled box is {{actually}} that of a pig. Using a potion to disguise herself as an old hag, the Queen creates a poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into the [...] "Sleeping Death", a curse {{that can only be}} broken by [...] "love's first kiss", but dismisses that Snow White will be buried alive. The Queen goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> while the dwarfs are away, but the animals are wary of her and rush off to find the dwarfs. Faking a potential heart attack, the Queen tricks Snow White bringing her into the cottage to rest. The Queen fools Snow White into biting into the poisoned apple under the pretense that it is a magic apple that grants wishes. As Snow White falls asleep the Queen proclaims that she is now the fairest of the land. The dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage and give chase, trapping her on a cliff. She tries to roll a boulder over them, but before she can do so, lightning strikes the cliff, causing her to fall to her death.|$|E
500|$|Furious that Humbert tricked her, the Queen {{decides that}} first Snow White shall die {{by her own}} hand and at any cost. She goes down the dungeon to her secret room where she {{practices}} her dark magic, complete with a pet raven that [...] "knows all her secrets," [...] and in desperation uses her spellbook and cauldron to mix a potion that transforms her into a hag. Her beauty is shrouded in ugliness and age, though presumably reversible. She then conjures a poison apple, which will cause [...] "the Sleeping Death", and proceeds to leave the castle via a moat boat. She is sure {{that no one would}} know or perform the counter-curse to her spell, and believes the Dwarfs would bury her rival alive, thinking her dead. The Queen comes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage,</b> followed by two vicious vultures, and finds Snow White baking a pie for Grumpy the dwarf. Somehow Snow White's animal friends realize that the old hag is the Queen. After an unsuccessful attempt to warn Snow White by attacking the Queen, they go to warn the Dwarfs of the Queen's arrival. The Queen tricks the princess into letting her inside the cottage and eating the bewitched apple, telling her that it is a magic wishing apple. Snow White takes a bite and falls to the floor, apparently dead.|$|E
500|$|Sense and Sensibility {{was shot}} entirely on {{location}} within England, {{mostly in the}} counties of Berkshire, Surrey, Buckinghamshire, and Devon. Filming began in April 2007 and lasted until early June. Blackpool Mill, a fifteenth-century cottage in north Devon, was turned into Barton Cottage, {{the home of the}} Dashwood girls. The art director for the series, James Merifield, had walked past the cottage in 2006 and thought it would be an ideal setting for a film. He was later sent back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> by the location manager for Sense and Sensibility, and he decided the place would be right for the production. The owners of Blackpool Mill, Sir Hugh and Lady Stucley, were contacted in February 2007 by the BBC who inquired about the possibility of filming there. Caroline Gammell from The Daily Telegraph reported that [...] "camera crews, production assistants, directors and actors swarmed over Blackpool Mill, turning the rustic four-bedroom home into the romantic hub of Jane Austen's novel. Set designers took the cottage more firmly into the 19th century, adding a porch at the front as well as dormer windows, fake shutters and an extra chimney." [...] The interior of cottage was [...] "a little scruffy" [...] for Mrs Dashwood's status, so scenes featuring the inside of the cottage were filmed in a studio. Filming took place at the cottage over eight days in May.|$|E
50|$|Indian lake {{continued}} {{as a summer}} community for many years. In 1924 there were about 500 summer residents in Indian lake. The Great Depression years saw a few families move from New York City <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottages</b> they owned. <b>The</b> following generation's need for homes {{of their own and}} the post World War II housing shortage further accelerated the development of the community as a year-round residential area.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, a {{community}} archaeology group {{commissioned by the}} Highley Initiative investigated the overgrown tree lined mound that included a row of demolished terrace <b>cottages</b> at <b>the</b> New England Site.Excavation of the site confirmed that the structure aligned east of <b>the</b> terraced <b>cottages,</b> {{is more likely to}} be a nineteenth century addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end <b>cottage,</b> possibly being another cottage, but may have ended up as an annex <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attached <b>cottage.</b> Other remains found also include a 19th-century pathway, garden, and a drain co-existent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> building.|$|R

500|$|Along with a {{focus on}} the {{characterizations}} and comedic possibilities of the dwarfs, Creedon's eighteen-page outline of the story written from the October meetings, featured a continuous flow of gags as well as the Queen's attempt to kill Snow White with a poisoned comb, an element taken from the Grimms' original story. After persuading Snow White to use the comb, the disguised Queen would have escaped alive, but the dwarfs would have arrived in time to remove it. After the failure of the comb, the Queen was to have the Prince captured and taken to her dungeon, where she would have come to him (story sketches show this event both with the Queen and the Witch) and used magic to bring the dungeon's skeletons to life, making them dance for him and identifying one skeleton as [...] "Prince Oswald", an example of the more humorous atmosphere of this original story treatment. It is written in story notes that the Queen has such magical power only in her own domain, the castle. With the Prince refusing to marry her, the Queen leaves him to his death (one sketch shows the Prince trapped in a subterranean chamber filling with water) as she makes her way to the dwarfs' cottage with the poisoned apple. The forest animals were to help the Prince escape the Queen's minions and find his horse. The Prince was to ride <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage</b> to save Snow White but took the wrong road (despite warnings from the forest animals and his horse, whom he, unlike Snow White, could not understand). He, therefore, would not have arrived in time to save her from the Queen but {{would have been able to}} save her with love's first kiss. This plot was not used in the final film, though many sketches of the scene in the dungeon were made by Ferdinand Hovarth.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the bells}} and organ {{had not yet been}} installed, it is {{probable}} that the mason James Simpson was still working on the same building on 9 August 1880.

2500|$|In [...] "The Piazza", {{especially}} {{written as}} an introductory {{story to the}} volume, the protagonist idealizes a radiant spot on the mountain he looks upon from his piazza. This spot is a house and one day he goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cottage,</b> {{only to find the}} unhappy girl Marianna, who longs to see the lucky individual who lives in the white house she looks upon from her window. The narrator understands that he himself has been the object of a fantasy not unlike his own, and leaves thinking how all idealism is an illusion. In addition to numerous biblical and mythological references, which Sealts calls [...] "a familiar Melvillean pattern," [...] the story alludes to Emerson's essay [...] "The Problem", Don Quixote and Paradise Lost, and explicitly namechecks Edmund Spenser. The narrator points to some plays by Shakespeare, and according to Sealts, the girl Marianna should remind the reader of both the Marianna in Shakespeare's Measure for Measure and Alfred, Lord Tennyson's Marianna.|$|E
