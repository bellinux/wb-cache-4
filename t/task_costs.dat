Previously, importance was manipulated by emphasizing the importance of the prospective memory task relative to the ongoing task it was embedded in. This resulted in better prospective memory performance but also ongoing <b>task</b> <b>costs.</b> In the present study, we simply instructed one group of participants that the prospective memory task was important (i. e., absolute importance instruction) and compared them to a group with relative importance instructions and a control group. The results showed that absolute importance lead to an increase in prospective memory performance without enhancing ongoing <b>task</b> <b>costs,</b> whereas relative importance resulted in both increased prospective memory performance and ongoing <b>task</b> <b>costs.</b> Thus, prospective memory can be enhanced without ongoing <b>task</b> <b>costs,</b> which is particularly crucial for safety-work contexts...|$|E
40|$|An {{external}} {{focus of}} attention {{has been shown to}} result in superior motor performance compared to an internal {{focus of attention}}. This study investigated whether this is due to enhanced levels of movement automatization, as predicted by the constrained action hypothesis (McNevin, Shea, & Wulf, 2003). Thirty healthy participants performed a cyclic one-leg extension-flexion task with both the dominant and non-dominant leg. Focus of attention was manipulated via instructions. The degree of automatization of movement was assessed by measuring dual <b>task</b> <b>costs</b> as well as movement execution parameters (i. e., EMG activity, movement fluency, and movement regularity). Results revealed that an external focus of attention led to significantly better motor performance (i. e., shorter movement duration) than an internal focus. Although dual <b>task</b> <b>costs</b> of the motor task did not differ as a function of attentional focus, cognitive dual <b>task</b> <b>costs</b> were significantly higher when attention was directed internally. An external focus of attention resulted in more fluent and more regular movement execution than an internal focus, whereas no differences were found concerning muscular activity. These results indicate that an external focus of attention results in more automatized movements than an internal focus and, therefore, provide support for the constrained action hypothesis. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} if dual tasking and visual binding share a similar cognitive architecture. Here, it was hypothesised that the binding process would alleviate the executive demands associated with dual tasking, and consequently reduce the dual <b>task</b> <b>cost</b> (i. e., the reduction in task accuracy). Participants were asked to remember object and colour information concurrently. In the control condition, objects and colours were not related, but the “typical” condition used objects and colours that were found to be reliably associated, and would therefore be likely to reflect hardwired bindings in long term memory. There was no significant difference between the dual <b>task</b> <b>cost</b> for each condition, but some participants clearly benefited from the presence of associated colours and objects. Furthermore, this benefit was predicted by a participants’ verbal span and vividness of visual imagery. However, it is unclear whether the benefit is attributable to associative priming or visual binding, impeding any implications for the relationship between dual tasking and visual binding. As such, future directions are discussed that could hopefully delineate the cause of the benefit in the typical dual task condition. In spite of this ambiguity, the data nonetheless revealed ways in which dual <b>task</b> <b>cost</b> can be reduced; this in turn carries implications for the production and use of efficient dual task strategies...|$|R

Set one paired simple choice RT with digit forward; set two paired complex choice RT with digit backward. Each task within each set had easy and hard conditions. For the simple choice RT, participants viewed single letters and pressed a specified keyboard key if the letter was X or Z or a different key for other letters (easy). For the hard condition, there were 4 target letters (X, Z, O, Y). Digit forward consisted of 4 (easy) or 5 (hard) digits. For the complex choice RT, participants viewed 464 matrices of Xs and Os, and indicated whether four Xs (easy) or four Xs or four Os (hard) appeared in a row. Digit backward consisted of 3 (easy) or 4 (hard) digits. Within each set, participants performed every possible combination of tasks. We found that in the simple choice RT tasks older adults were significantly slower than, but as accurate as younger adults. In the complex choice RT tasks, older adults were significantly less accurate, but as fast as younger adults. For both age groups and both dual task sets, RT decreased and error rates increased with greater task difficulty.

40|$|Background: Performance of {{additional}} tasks disturbs postural control in elderly. It is unknown, however, how postural control is affected in elderly fallers and non-fallers in a reduced sensory situation. Objective: To compare differences between single and dual tasking in three test conditions; (1) no-vision, (2) under reduced somatosensory information and (3) {{with a combination}} of both conditions. Design: An observational cohort study with participants assigned to a 12 -month pretest fall assessment and a postural balance assessment. Methods: Fifteen independently living elderly participated (77. 5 ± 7. 0 [63 - 87] years). Falls were pre-assessed with a 1 - year monthy “fall calendar”. Postural control was analyzed by means of a force platform. Participants were standing quiet (first task) while counting backwards (second task). A 2 -factor (group x condition) ANOVA was performed at p<. 05. Differences of postural (DTCp) and cognitive dual <b>task</b> <b>costs</b> (DTCc) between test conditions were analyzed (one-way ANOVA). Results: The analysis showed significant group (fallers/non-fallers) and condition effects. Post hoc analyses indicated that the postural control variables were significantly different during the concurrent reduced vision and somatosensory information. Dual <b>task</b> <b>costs</b> showed a significant difference between normal (N) and the combined condition (NV+RP) in non-fallers. Conclusion: The combination of reduced visual and somatosensory information causes a larger disturbance of postural stability compared with the reduction of visual or somatosensory information alone. Non-fallers seem to have no threats to the postural control stability in this combined reduced sensory situation. They reduce their postural control, which leaves them enough resources to compensate for the reduced sensory information...|$|E

40|$|<b>Task</b> switch <b>costs</b> often show an asymmetry, with switch costs being larger when {{switching}} from {{a difficult task}} to an easier task. This asymmetry has been explained by difficult tasks being represented more strongly and consequently requiring more inhibition prior to switching to the easier task.

Further experiments showed that neither <b>task</b> switch <b>costs</b> nor switch cost asymmetries were due to perceptual factors (e. g., perceptual priming effects).

Moreover, the finding that asymmetrical switch costs were observed (1) {{in the absence of a}} task switch proper and (2) without differences in task difficulty, suggests that present theories of <b>task</b> switch <b>costs</b> and switch cost asymmetries are in important ways incomplete and need to be modified. 10 page(s...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Deterioration of {{executive}} {{functions in the}} elderly {{has been associated with}} impairments in walking performance. This may be caused by limited cognitive flexibility and working memory, but could also be caused by altered prioritization of simultaneously performed tasks. To disentangle these options we investigated the associations between Trail Making Test performance [...] which specifically measures cognitive flexibility and working memory [...] and dual <b>task</b> <b>costs,</b> a measure of prioritization. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Out of the TREND study (Tuebinger evaluation of Risk factors for Early detection of Neurodegenerative Disorders), 686 neurodegeneratively healthy, non-demented elderly aged 50 to 80 years were classified according to their Trail Making Test performance (delta TMT; TMT-B minus TMT-A). The subjects performed 20 m walks with habitual and maximum speed. Dual tasking performance was tested with walking at maximum speed, in combination with checking boxes on a clipboard, and subtracting serial 7 s at maximum speeds. As expected, the poor TMT group performed worse when subtracting serial 7 s under single and dual task conditions, and they walked more slowly when simultaneously subtracting serial 7 s, compared to the good TMT performers. In the walking when subtracting serial 7 s condition but not in the other 3 conditions, dual <b>task</b> <b>costs</b> were higher in the poor TMT performers (median 20 %; range - 6 to 58 %) compared to the good performers (17 %; - 16 to 43 %; p< 0. 001). To the contrary, the proportion of the poor TMT performance group that made calculation errors under the dual tasking situation was lower than under the single task situation, but higher in the good TMT performance group (poor performers, - 1. 6 %; good performers, + 3 %; p =  0. 035). CONCLUSION: Under most challenging conditions, the elderly with poor TMT performance prioritize the cognitive task at the expense of walking velocity. This indicates that poor cognitive flexibility and working memory are directly associated with altered prioritization...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the widely held, but largely untested, view that implicit memory (repetition priming) reflects an automatic form of retrieval. Specifically, in Experiment 1 we explored whether a secondary task (syllable monitoring), performed during retrieval, would disrupt performance on explicit (cued recall) and implicit (stem completion) memory tasks equally. Surprisingly, despite substantial memory and secondary costs to cued recall when performed with a syllable-monitoring task, the same manipulation had no effect on stem completion priming or on secondary task performance. In Experiment 2 we demonstrated that even when using a particularly demanding version of the stem completion task that incurred secondary <b>task</b> <b>costs,</b> the corresponding disruption to implicit memory performance was minimal. Collectively, the results are consistent with the view that implicit memory retrieval requires little or no processing capacity and is not seemingly susceptible to the effects of dividing attention at retrieval...|$|E

Afterwards the cost function is used in conjunction with a genetic algorithm to find an optimized schedule that maximizes its robustness. However, in the definition of the cost of failure function the authors assume that the potential loss in the execution cost of each task is independent of the other workflow tasks. In other words, a failure always has a local scope, without possibility of chaining impact outside the workflow. Moreover, there is no workflow characterization in terms of data transfers and <b>task</b> <b>costs.</b> Robustness or failure rates are not specified or tied to a specific property such as MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures).|$|E
