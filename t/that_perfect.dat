5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect. A perfect duty always holds true—there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed <b>that</b> <b>perfect</b> duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E

At midseason, Balki receives a promotion at the Chronicle, drawing a weekly comic strip based on his stuffed sheep, Dimitri. Gorpley and Lydia make occasional appearances throughout the season, but are gradually phased out as they have little relevance to Larry and Balki's new career paths.|$|E
25|$|Hunter Pacing is a sport where a {{horse and}} rider team travel a trail at speeds based the ideal {{conditions}} for the horse, with competitors seeking to ride closest to <b>that</b> <b>perfect</b> time. Hunter paces are usually held in a series. Hunter paces are usually a few miles long and covered mostly at a canter or gallop. The horsemanship and management skills of the rider are also considered in the scoring, and periodic stops are required for veterinarians to check the vital signs and overall soundness of the horses.|$|E
25|$|Peirce {{goes on to}} list four common {{barriers}} to inquiry: (1) Assertion of absolute certainty; (2) maintaining that something is absolutely unknowable; (3) maintaining that something is absolutely inexplicable because absolutely basic or ultimate; (4) holding <b>that</b> <b>perfect</b> exactitude is possible, especially such as to quite preclude unusual and anomalous phenomena. To refuse absolute theoretical certainty {{is the heart of}} fallibilism, which Peirce unfolds into refusals to set up any of the listed barriers. Peirce elsewhere argues (1897) that logic's presupposition of fallibilism leads at length to the view that chance and continuity are very real (tychism and synechism).|$|E

25|$|In late January 1992, {{the network}} rolled out {{plans to launch}} a similar family-friendly comedy block for Saturday, also helmed by TGIF creator Jim Janicek. It was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Perfect</b> Strangers would move from TGIF to join this new lineup to help it take off. On February 1, 1992, Perfect Strangers began airing in the 9 p.m. slot of I Love Saturday Night, the new TGIF sister lineup (which included Growing Pains, Who's the Boss?, and Capitol Critters). The series experienced a drastic decline in ratings. It dropped to #65 {{for the remainder of}} the season. In July 1992, ABC moved Perfect Strangers back to Fridays at 9:30p.m. ET to fill the timeslot with reruns until the new TGIF season began. The reruns that were aired won their timeslot as they had before.|$|E
25|$|A perfect graph is a graph {{in which}} the {{chromatic}} number {{and the size of}} the maximum clique are equal, and in which this equality persists in every induced subgraph. It is now known (the strong perfect graph theorem) <b>that</b> <b>perfect</b> graphs may be characterized as the graphs that do not have as induced subgraphs either an odd cycle or the complement of an odd cycle (a so-called odd hole). However, for many years this remained an unsolved conjecture, only proven for special subclasses of graphs. One of these subclasses was the family of claw-free graphs: it was discovered by several authors that claw-free graphs without odd cycles and odd holes are perfect. Perfect claw-free graphs may be recognized in polynomial time. In a perfect claw-free graph, the neighborhood of any vertex forms the complement of a bipartite graph. It is possible to color perfect claw-free graphs, or to find maximum cliques in them, in polynomial time.|$|E
25|$|On June 3, 1995, while {{pitching}} for Montreal, {{he retired}} the first 27 Padres hitters he faced. However, {{the score was}} still tied 0–0 at that point and the game went into extra innings. The Expos scored a run {{in the top of}} the 10th, but Martínez surrendered a double to the 28th batter he faced, Bip Roberts. Expos manager Felipe Alou then removed Martínez from the game, bringing in reliever Mel Rojas, who retired the next three batters. Martínez officially recorded neither a perfect game nor a no-hitter. Until 1991, the rules would have judged it differently; however, a rule clarification specified <b>that</b> <b>perfect</b> games, even beyond nine innings, must remain perfect until the game is completed for them to be considered perfect. This retroactively decertified many no-hit games, including Ernie Shore's perfect relief stint in 1917 and Harvey Haddix's legendary 12 perfect innings in 1959 (lost in the 13th).|$|E

Nintendo Power praised the game's detailed graphics, fluid animations and creative environments, while Chris Hudak of The Electric Playground highlighted the game's fully voiced conversations and numerous sound effects like footfalls and gunshots. Frank Provo of GameSpot also praised the game's audio, but criticized {{the fact that there}} is no music during gameplay.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Perfect Dark Zero was divided but generally positive, garnering a Metacritic aggregated review score of 81 out of 100 respectively. Writing for GameSpot, Greg Kasavin felt <b>that</b> <b>Perfect</b> Dark Zero [...] "champions the Xbox 360 with its excellent assortment of single and multiplayer game types, {{as well as}} its incredible good looks and dynamic, intense action." [...] He concluded that the game [...] "delivers just about everything you could hope for from a first-person shooter."

500|$|Upon release, Perfect Dark {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from magazines and websites. Critics praised multiple {{aspects of the}} game, particularly its graphics, sound and value. Joe Fielder of GameSpot felt <b>that</b> <b>Perfect</b> Dark is [...] "unparalleled" [...] as a console first-person shooter, while Nintendo Power said that the game [...] is [...] "more compelling than most action movies and much deeper than any video game of its type." [...] Martin Kitts, writing for N64 Magazine, described it as [...] "dauntingly huge", stating that it [...] "takes everything that made its predecessor such an enduring favourite and does it bigger, better and more often." [...] Chi Kong Lui of GameCritics criticised the weak characters and unoriginal storyline, but nevertheless judged the [...] "extraordinary amount [...] of high-quality multiplayer modes and features", meant that [...] "the game is still a blast".|$|E
500|$|Despite solid reviews, {{numerous}} publications remarked <b>that</b> <b>Perfect</b> Dark Zero did {{not meet}} the expectations. According to GameCritics, [...] "It took Rare a whole console generation to do it ... and the wait wasn't really worth it". Game Informer found the game underwhelming, reviewing it under the tagline [...] "Don't believe the hype". In a positive review, GameSpy observed that [...] "Perfect Dark Zero is a lot of fun and does a lot of things very well, but it's just not the killer-app that we'd all hoped for". Edge said that the game [...] "falls short", especially when compared to , a successful first-person shooter that was released as a launch title for the original Xbox. In 2010, GameTrailers placed the game 6th in their list of the [...] "Top 10 Disappointments of the Decade" [...] and 10th in their [...] "Top 10 Worst Sequels" [...] list.|$|E
