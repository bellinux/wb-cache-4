5|$|A novel {{vaccine for}} dengue fever has been {{approved}} and is commercially available {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used.|$|E
5|$|After calling at Balestrand, Kommandøren {{proceeded}} to Leikanger, where the soldiers on board disembarked.

Amongst the targets were the soldiers unloaded by Kommandøren, the troops being on the march to nearby Hermansverk. The attack killed a travelling salesman from Bergen outright, and wounded a 16-year-old local boy and the boy's mother, restaurateur Isak Roksvåg from Kommandøren and the ship's captain, Thorvald Johannessen.

Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken <b>to</b> <b>hospital,</b> where Félix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him.

40|$|Background—Patients {{with acute}} {{myocardial}} infarction (AMI) who are admitted <b>to</b> <b>hospitals</b> without coronary revascularization are frequently transferred <b>to</b> <b>hospitals</b> with this capability, yet we know little about the basis for how such revascularization hospitals are selected. Methods and Results—We examined interhospital transfer patterns in 71 336 AMI patients admitted <b>to</b> <b>hospitals</b> without revascularization capabilities in the 2006 Medicare claims using network analysis and regression models. A total of 31 607 (44. 3 %) AMI patients were transferred from 1684 nonrevascularization <b>hospitals</b> <b>to</b> 1104 revascularization <b>hospitals.</b> Median time <b>to</b> transfer was 2 days. Median transfer distance was 26. 7 miles, with 96. 1 % within 100 miles. In 45. 8 % of cases, patients bypassed a closer <b>hospital</b> <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> a farther <b>hospital</b> that had a better 30 -day risk standardized mortality rates. However, in 36. 8 % of cases, another revascularization hospital with lower 30 -day risk-standardized mortality was actually closer to the original admitting nonrevascularization hospital than the observed transfer destination. Adjusted regression models demonstrated that shorter transfer distances were more common than transfers <b>to</b> the <b>hospitals</b> with lowest 30 -day mortality rates. Simulations suggest that an optimized system that prioritized the transfer of AMI patients <b>to</b> a nearby <b>hospital</b> with the lowest 30 -day mortality rate might produce clinically meaningful reductions in mortality. Conclusions—More than 40 % of AMI patients admitted <b>to</b> nonrevascularization <b>hospitals</b> are transferred <b>to</b> revascular- ization <b>hospitals.</b> Many patients are not directed <b>to</b> nearby <b>hospitals</b> with the lowest 30 -day risk-standardized mortality, and this may represent an opportunity for improvement.

5|$|Alprazolam {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government study conducted by SAMHSA found that, in the U.S., benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> emergency and urgent care facilities. Men and women are equally likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam. The number of emergency room visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
