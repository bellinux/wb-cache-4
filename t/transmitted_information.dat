5|$|Toward {{the end of}} September 1941, Sorge <b>transmitted</b> <b>information</b> that Japan {{would not}} {{initiate}} hostilities against the USSR in the East, thereby freeing Red Army divisions stationed in Siberia for the defence of Moscow. In October 1941 Sorge was unmasked and arrested by the Japanese. Apparently, he was entirely trusted by the German ambassador Eugen Ott, and was allowed access to top secret cables from Berlin in the embassy in Tokyo. Eventually, this involvement would lead to Heinrich Georg Stahmer replacing Ott in January 1943. Sorge {{on the other hand}} would be executed in November 1944 and elevated to a national hero in the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Matrix {{inversion}} {{also plays}} {{a significant role in the}} MIMO (Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output) technology in wireless communications. The MIMO system consists of N transmit and M receive antennas. Unique signals, occupying the same frequency band, are sent via N transmit antennas and are received via M receive antennas. The signal arriving at each receive antenna will be a linear combination of the N transmitted signals forming a NxM transmission matrix H. It is crucial for the matrix H to be invertible for the receiver to be able to figure out the <b>transmitted</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{signal is}} then fed into a circuit {{where it is}} mixed with a sine wave from a {{variable}} frequency oscillator known as the local oscillator (LO). The mixer uses a non-linear component to produce both sum and difference beat frequencies signals, each one containing the modulation contained in the desired signal. The output of the mixer may include the original RF signal at fRF, the local oscillator signal at fLO, and the two new heterodyne frequencies fRF+fLO and fRFfLO. The mixer may inadvertently produce additional frequencies such as third- and higher-order intermodulation products. Ideally, the IF bandpass filter removes all but the desired IF signal at fIF. The IF signal contains the original modulation (<b>transmitted</b> <b>information)</b> that the received radio signal had at fRF.|$|E

25|$|In April 1944, with 120 other agents, he {{was charged}} with {{gathering}} intelligence about enemy military installations, supply depots and troop movements in northern France, in preparation for the upcoming Allied invasion. Deployed by parachute near Chartres, disguised as a postal worker, Veuve acquired and <b>transmitted</b> <b>information</b> about crucial enemy infrastructure, such as Le Bourget airport, an oil refinery and an underground rocket factory. To avoid radiolocation of his signal, he emplaced himself close to a German military unit's transmitter. After the Allied invasion, Veuve shifted his operations further inland, on one occasion narrowly escaping an SS raid with a bullet wound in his foot, while his two bodyguards were captured and executed. With the advancing Allied forces he eventually reached Germany, being one of the first Allied officers to reach the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.|$|E
500|$|An {{emission}} designation is of {{the form}} BBBB 123 45, where BBBB is the bandwidth of the signal, 1 is a letter indicating the Type of modulation used, 2 is a digit representing the Type of modulating signal, 3 is a letter corresponding to the Type of information transmitted, 4 is a letter indicating the practical details of the <b>transmitted</b> <b>information,</b> and 5 is a letter that represents the method of multiplexing. [...] The 4 and 5 fields are optional. For example, an emission designation would appear read as 500H A3E, where 500H translates to 500Hz, and A3E is the emission mode as permitted.|$|E

2500|$|Although AM {{was used}} in a few crude {{experiments}} in multiplex telegraph and telephone transmission in the late 1800s, the practical development of amplitude modulation is synonymous with the development between 1900 and 1920 of [...] "radiotelephone" [...] transmission, that is, the effort to send sound (audio) by radio waves. [...] The first radio transmitters, called spark gap transmitters, <b>transmitted</b> <b>information</b> by wireless telegraphy, using different length pulses of carrier wave to spell out text messages in Morse code. [...] They couldn't transmit audio because the carrier consisted of strings of damped waves, pulses of radio waves that declined to zero, {{that sounded like a}} buzz in receivers. [...] In effect they were already amplitude modulated.|$|E
