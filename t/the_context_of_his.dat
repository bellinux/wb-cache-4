5|$|Symeon {{wrote in}} a similar style and taught the {{traditional}} views of several early Christian fathers and hesychasts, including St. Augustine, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Mark the Hermit. Where Symeon differed from his predecessors was in his transparent and open sharing of his most interior experiences. Symeon was the first Byzantine mystic to freely share those experiences, which were given in <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teaching that the direct experience of God was something to which all Christians could aspire.|$|E
5|$|A general {{perception}} on Narayan {{was that}} he did not involve himself or his writings with the politics or problems of India, as mentioned by V. S. Naipaul in one of his columns. However, according to Wyatt Mason of The New Yorker, although Narayan's writings seem simple and display a lack of interest in politics, he delivers his narrative with an artful and deceptive technique when dealing with such subjects and does not entirely avoid them, rather letting the words play in the reader's mind. Srinivasa Iyengar, former vice-chancellor of Andhra University, says that Narayan wrote about political topics only in <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> subjects, quite unlike his compatriot Mulk Raj Anand who dealt with the political structures and problems of the time. Paul Brians, in his book Modern South Asian Literature in English, says that the fact that Narayan completely ignored British rule and focused on the private lives of his characters is a political statement on its own, declaring his independence from the influence of colonialism.|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of this}} thesis deals {{with the image of}} the Devil in a cultural perspective and historical contexts within figurative art, literature, cinema, theater, Central European folklore and human history. Subsequently, it focuses on the Devil with regards to <b>the</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> interpretative forms. <b>The</b> practical part describes my own experience of theatrical interpretation of the character of the Devil through his various translation into dramatic texts. This, with reference to: M. Bulgakov´s the Master and Margarita, F. M. Dostojevskij´s Brothers Karamazov, Petr Boháč´s Dante ? The Light in a Darkness, J. Kráľa´s Wicked Maidens and into specific W.

5|$|The Fiery Trial {{begins with}} Lincoln's {{encounters}} with slavery {{in his early}} life, growing up in Kentucky and Indiana. He occasionally dealt with issues of slavery in his law practice in Illinois. The book also discusses Lincoln's position on slavery in <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> political career. Lincoln was a moderate, attempting {{to bridge the gap}} between the abolitionist Radical Republicans and conservative Democrats, including those in the slave-holding states, whom he hoped would choose preserving the Union over steadfastly defending slavery. Lincoln initially supported the idea of voluntary colonization of freed blacks to Africa, a stance supported by some politicians at the time, although considered unethical by many. However, Lincoln eventually abandoned his moderate stance on slavery when he determined that to win the American Civil War, he needed to act to end slavery.|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} {{of church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible {{in one hand and a}} sword in the other. For him, the church and state are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship between church and state in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, a longing for liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Never {{stopping}} his work, in 1940, {{he finished}} his memoirs. He also placed {{the finishing touches on}} his musical research on the life of Ludwig van Beethoven.

25|$|Abhinavagupta {{remained}} unmarried all his life, we do however {{know him}} to be an adept of Kaula and as such, used his energy (ojas, or internally sublimated semen) as a vital force, {{a constant source of}} shakti to power the spiritual nervous system he outlined in his works. This system involves ritual union between Purusha as (Shiva) and shakti, yet this union is essentially non-physical and universal, and thus for a master such as Abhinavagupta, he was always in communion with Shiva-Shakti. We can only speculate about whether he was physically chaste, and either answer to this question is not very meaningful in <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life and teachings. Abhinavagupta parallels Shiva as both ascetic and enjoyer.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{learning}} the Scottish language and being thoroughly christianised, Oswiu may have fought for his Gaelic hosts, perhaps receiving his arms—a significant event—from a King of Dál Riata, such as Eochaid Buide, son of that Áedán mac Gabráin whom {{his father had}} defeated at the Battle of Degsastan. The Irish annals name one Oisiric mac Albruit, rigdomna Saxan—ætheling Osric—among the dead, alongside Connad Cerr, King of Dál Riata, and others of the Cenél nGabráin, at the Battle of Fid Eóin. Whether Oswiu's marriage with the Uí Néill princess Fín of the Cenél nEógain, {{and the birth of}} Aldfrith, should be placed in <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> exile, or took place at a later date is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|Working as a lawyer, {{he became}} a {{magistrate}} in 1881, when he pleaded on behalf of socialists on trial for incidents {{that occurred during the}} 10-year celebrations of the Paris Commune. He also pursued a political career, becoming cabinet chief to Interior Minister Rosetti in 1880. His final break with Junimea came in 1881, when he objected to the publication of a passage in Mihai Eminescu's Scrisoarea a III-a that denigrated Rosetti; he quit when publication went ahead. As revenge, both Maiorescu and Negruzzi gave unfair depictions of Panu in their writings, characterizing him as an ungrateful endlessly adaptable chameleon. It was only in 1943 that Eugen Lovinescu supplied a more balanced view of the man, placing him within <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> period.|$|E

25|$|An {{independently}} written {{narrative of}} Paul's life and ministry, {{found in the}} Acts of the Apostles, is {{used to determine the}} date, and possible authorship, of Pauline letters by locating their origin within <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life. For example, Paul mentions that he is a prisoner in his Epistle to Philemon 1:7; based on this statement, J. A. T. Robinson argued that this captivity was Paul's imprisonment in Caesarea, while W. M. Ramsay identified this as Paul’s captivity in Rome, while others have placed the captivity in Ephesus. One difficulty with this position is the limited data available on Paul's historical setting, and this is especially true with the conclusion of the narrative of Acts prior to Paul's death. It also assumes that the book of Acts was written by an actual traveling companion of Paul's.|$|E
25|$|Boas's {{stance against}} spying {{took place in}} <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{struggle}} {{to establish a new}} model for academic anthropology at Columbia University. Previously, American anthropology was based at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Peabody Museum at Harvard, and these anthropologists competed with Boas's students for control over the American Anthropological Association (and its flagship publication American Anthropologist). When the National Academy of Sciences established the National Research Council in 1916 as a means by which scientists could assist the United States government prepare for entry into the war in Europe, competition between the two groups intensified. Boas's rival, W.H. Holmes (who had gotten the job of Director at the Field Museum for which Boas had been passed over 26 years earlier), was appointed to head the NRC; Morley was a protégé of Holmes.|$|E
25|$|On a scholarship, {{he studied}} at Kenyon College, a small liberal arts school in central Ohio from 1947–1948, graduating with a B.A.. Inspired by radical {{debate in the}} student community, he wrote a {{critical}} essay on Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom. Palme wrote his senior honour thesis on the United Auto Workers union, led at the time by Walter Reuther. After graduation he traveled {{throughout the country and}} eventually ended up in Detroit, where his hero Reuther agreed to an interview which lasted several hours. In later years, Palme regularly remarked during his many subsequent American visits, that the United States had made him a socialist, a remark that often has caused confusion. Within <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> American experience, it was not that Palme was repelled by what he found in America, but rather that he was inspired by it.|$|E
