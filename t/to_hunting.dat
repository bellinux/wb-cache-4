5|$|Daniel Craig as James Bond, agent 007. The {{director}} Sam Mendes {{has described}} Bond as being extremely focused in Spectre, likening his new-found dedication <b>to</b> <b>hunting.</b>|$|E
5|$|A highly active predator, {{the river}} otter has adapted <b>to</b> <b>hunting</b> in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The {{vulnerability}} and seasonal availability of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices. This availability {{is influenced by}} the following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat availability for the various prey species, environmental factors, such as water depth and temperature, and seasonal changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.|$|E
5|$|Birth {{control is}} also being {{considered}} as an alternative <b>to</b> <b>hunting</b> {{as a means of}} controlling overpopulation in wild animals. Contraceptive vaccines {{have been found to be}} effective in a number of different animal populations. Kenyan goat herders fix a skirt, called an olor, to male goats to prevent them from impregnating female goats.|$|E

50|$|Burragorang is said {{to derive}} from the words burro (meaning kangaroo) or booroon (small animal) and the word gang (meaning <b>to</b> <b>hunt).</b> Therefore, Burragorang is {{believed}} to mean place <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> kangaroo or place <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> small animals.|$|R
50|$|Cory {{then turned}} to the issue of the NRTA. He found that it {{extinguished}} the right <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> commercially but not the right <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> for food.|$|R
5|$|Groups of {{wildebeest}} {{females and}} young {{live in the}} small areas established by the male. When groups of wildebeest join together, the female to male ratio is higher because the females choose {{to move to the}} areas held by a smaller number of males. This female-dominated sex ratio may be due to illegal hunting and human disturbance, with higher male mortality having been attributed <b>to</b> <b>hunting.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Mary discovers Azazel {{standing}} over baby Sam's crib; {{he had been}} feeding his blood to the infant. Upon being interrupted, the demon pins her to the ceiling, slashes her stomach and causes her to burst into flames. Her death inspires John to dedicate his life <b>to</b> <b>hunting</b> down Azazel, {{at the same time}} training Sam and Dean to hunt supernatural creatures.|$|E
5|$|Outside North America it {{is subject}} <b>to</b> <b>hunting</b> for food {{or because of}} its liking for rice, and {{persecution}} means {{that it is now}} rare in Madagascar. Pesticides used on rice fields may also have an adverse impact, causing liver and breast muscle damage even at sub-lethal levels.|$|E
50|$|The Billy {{remains a}} rare breed, {{although}} there are several packs in its native France used <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> roe deer, and two packs <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> wild boar.|$|R
50|$|Promyshlenniki were {{adept at}} hunting on land but they lacked the skills <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> on water, where sea otters lived. The Promyshlenniki {{then turned to}} the native Aleut and Alutiiq men <b>to</b> do their <b>hunting</b> for them. These Alaska Natives were trained at a young age <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> sea otters. The Russians took the women and {{children}} hostage and forced the men <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> for them <b>to</b> ensure the safety of their families.|$|R
50|$|Gun {{dogs are}} used <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> {{all sorts of}} game. Some {{are used in the}} pursuit of big game, {{although}} the majority of working gun dogs are used <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> upland game birds.|$|R
5|$|The last sub-book of {{the text}} {{discusses}} recreation through horticulture {{and the art of}} creating gardens, painting, perfumery, architecture and the training and breeding of horses, elephants, lavakki (a type of quail), and other wildlife. A chapter is devoted to the royal sport of hunting deer or other wild game. It deals with 35 ways of game hunting of deer, in addition <b>to</b> <b>hunting</b> with dogs, falconry and fishing.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} been {{recorded}} in at least 6national parks and 12nature reserves. In China, Daweishan, Fenshuiling, and Huanglianshan Reserve maintained approximately 80% of that country's population of the species in 2007. However, the species is still vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>hunting,</b> even in protected areas. In Laos, the species {{has been recorded}} in seven National Biodiversity Conservation Areas.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} in 1844 {{is said to}} have {{wiped out}} the population of Cuban macaws from Pinar del Río. Subsequent hurricanes in 1846 and 1856 further destroyed their habitat in western Cuba and scattered the remaining population. In addition, a tropical storm hit the Zapata Swamp in 1851. With a healthy macaw population, such events could have been beneficial by creating suitable habitat. However, given the species' precarious position, it may have resulted in fragmented habitat and caused them to seek food in areas where they were more vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>hunting.</b>|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, Inuit {{have used}} bolas <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> birds, fouling {{the birds in}} air with {{the lines of the}} bola. People of a Feather showed Belcher Island Inuit using bolas <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> eider ducks on the wing.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{moratorium}} {{was put in}} place in 1986, more than 50,000 whales have been hunted and killed; there are three nations that are still able <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> whales because of loopholes in the ban. Norway is able <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> because of an “objection” to the ban; Iceland is able <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> because of a “reservation” and Japan is able <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> because they claim it is for “research purposes”. If combined these nations kill around 2,000 whales each year; these whales include humpback, minke, sperm, fin, Bryde’s, and sei. The IWC ban does allow for some Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling (ASW) in certain countries.|$|R
50|$|Its diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} larger insects, {{but it is}} also known to eat small mammals, birds, and tree frogs. It is known <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> from a perch, but has been known <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> on the wing too.|$|R
5|$|Bred {{primarily}} as hunting dogs, {{their goal is}} to find the bird, send it into the air and then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported <b>to</b> <b>hunting</b> sites.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed cats {{in a process}} of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort may have been too little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted <b>to</b> <b>hunting</b> the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E
5|$|Early {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} outrigger canoes from southern Borneo. Upon arrival, early settlers practiced slash-and-burn agriculture {{to clear the}} coastal rainforests for cultivation. The first settlers encountered Madagascar's abundance of megafauna, including giant lemurs, elephant birds, giant fossa and the Malagasy hippopotamus, which have since become extinct due <b>to</b> <b>hunting</b> and habitat destruction. By 600AD groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. Arab traders first reached the island between the seventh and ninth centuries. A wave of Bantu-speaking migrants from southeastern Africa arrived around 1000AD. They introduced the zebu, a type of long-horned humped cattle, which they kept in large herds.|$|E
50|$|The Elf King, {{believing that}} Emily is too {{dangerous}} to be left alone, sends another elf <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> her down. At the same time, elf soldiers continue <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> down Trellis, who is continuing his quest to recruit Emily.|$|R
50|$|In ancient Roman law, landowners {{could only}} take legal {{possession}} of animals by capturing and maintaining physical control over them. English common law originally restricted the right <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> animals <b>to</b> {{those who had}} permission from the Crown, but later laws allowed landowners <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> animals that entered upon their land through the principle of ratione soli. Over time, this developed into a system of laws where the right <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> was restricted <b>to</b> nobles and the landowning elite.|$|R
5000|$|The Urdu and Persian word [...] "Qurbani" [...] {{comes from}} the Arabic word 'Qurban'. It {{suggests}} that associate act performed <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> distance <b>to</b> Almighty God and <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> His sensible pleasure. Originally, the word 'Qurban' enclosed all acts of charity {{as a result of}} the aim of charity is nothing however <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> Allah's pleasure. But, in precise non secular nomenclature, the word was later confined to the sacrifice of associate animal slaughtered for the sake of God.|$|R
5|$|Frustrated {{with the}} legal hassles that went with land speculation, in 1788, Boone moved upriver to Point Pleasant, Virginia (now West Virginia). There he {{operated}} a trading post and occasionally worked as a surveyor's assistant. When Virginia created Kanawha County in 1789, Boone was appointed lieutenant colonel of the county militia. In 1791, {{he was elected to}} the Virginia legislature for the third time. He contracted to provide supplies for the Kanawha militia, but his debts prevented him from buying goods on credit, so he closed his store and returned <b>to</b> <b>hunting</b> and trapping.|$|E
5|$|Hunting along {{migration}} routes threatens some bird species. The {{populations of}} Siberian cranes (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) that wintered in India declined due <b>to</b> <b>hunting</b> along the route, particularly in Afghanistan and Central Asia. Birds were last seen in their favourite wintering grounds in Keoladeo National Park in 2002. Structures such as power lines, wind farms and offshore oil-rigs {{have also been}} known to affect migratory birds. Other migration hazards include pollution, storms, wildfires, and habitat destruction along migration routes, denying migrants food at stopover points. For example, in the East Asian–Australasian Flyway, up to 65% of key intertidal habitat at the Yellow Sea migration bottleneck has been destroyed since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{southeast}} Asian jungle cats {{still used}} to be the most common wild cats near villages in certain parts of northern Thailand and occurred in many protected areas of the country. However, since the early 1990s, jungle cats are rarely encountered and have suffered drastic declines due <b>to</b> <b>hunting</b> and habitat destruction. Today, their official status in the country is critically endangered. In Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, jungle cats have been subject to extensive hunting. Skins are occasionally recorded in border markets, and live individuals, possibly taken from Myanmar or Cambodia, occasionally turn up in the Khao Khieo and Chiang Mai zoos of Thailand.|$|E
50|$|The Beagle-Harrier breed is old, {{with its}} origins unclear; they were {{initially}} bred <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> rabbits {{and other small}} animals. They were popular in England since the early 14th century and were later imported into America in the mid-1800s <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> rabbits.|$|R
50|$|The {{gameplay}} {{follows the}} same format {{as the original}} games: the player chooses a location <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> in, one or more animals <b>to</b> <b>hunt,</b> and one or more weapons <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> with; time of day can also be changed and one or more accessories {{can be used as}} well. It has done very well with reviewers, receiving high scores among various gaming sites. Although fundamentally the same as Carnivores 2, Dinosaur Hunter features content not found in the original game.|$|R
50|$|One typical {{artefact}} of the industry, {{once considered}} diagnostic, {{is a small}} pointed blade with a straight blunt back, known as the Gravette point. These were used <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> big game including bison, horse, reindeer and mammoth. Gravettians also used nets <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> small game.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, due <b>to</b> <b>hunting,</b> the Alpine ibex survived in the Gran Paradiso and Vanoise area. Approximately 60 {{individual}} ibex survived, here. Ibex were intensively hunted, partly for sport, {{but also because}} their body parts were thought to have therapeutic properties: talismans were made from a small cross-shaped bone near the ibex's heart {{in order to protect}} against violent death. Due to the alarming decrease in the ibex population, Victor Emmanuel, soon to be King of Italy, declared the Royal Hunting Reserve of the Gran Paradiso in 1856. A protective guard was created for the ibex. Paths laid out for the ibex are still used today as part of 724 kilometres (450mi) of marked trails and mule tracks.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientists}} have {{hypothesized that the}} more rigid skull of Tarbosaurus was an adaptation <b>to</b> <b>hunting</b> the massive titanosaurid sauropods found in the Nemegt Formation, which {{did not exist in}} most of North America during the Late Cretaceous. The differences in skull mechanics also affect tyrannosaurid phylogeny. Tarbosaurus-like articulations between the skull bones are also seen in Alioramus from Mongolia, suggesting that it, and not Tyrannosaurus, is the closest relative of Tarbosaurus. Similarities between Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus might therefore be related to their large size, independently developed through convergent evolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} the presence of man in these upper areas of Glamorgan was discovered in 1963 at Craig y Llyn. A small chipped stone tool found at the site, recorded as possibly being of 'Creswellian' type or at least from the early Mesolithic period, places human activity on the plateau above the valleys. Many other Mesolithic items have been discovered in the Rhondda, predominantly in the upper areas around Blaenrhondda, Blaencwm and Maerdy, mainly stone age items relating <b>to</b> <b>hunting,</b> fishing and foraging which suggests seasonal nomadic activity. Though no definite Mesolithic settlements have been located in the area, the concentration of finds at the Craig y Llyn escarpment suggests the presence of a temporary campsite in the vicinity.|$|E
50|$|The trader {{encouraged}} the best hunters, exhorted the Indians <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> beaver, and directed their fleets of canoes to the rendezvous. Alliances were formed and wars were favoured {{to increase the}} supply of fur. Goods were traded that would encourage the Indian <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> beaver.|$|R
5000|$|The Right <b>to</b> <b>Hunt,</b> Fish and Harvest Game {{amendment}} adds {{a statement}} to the Constitution that [...] "the people have a right <b>to</b> <b>hunt,</b> fish, and harvest game." [...] That right is subject to regulations and restrictions that the General Assembly enacts by general law.|$|R
5000|$|Originally bred <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> the wolf, {{today the}} Poitevin is used <b>to</b> <b>hunt</b> boar and deer; the breed is renounced for its {{extraordinary}} nose, melodious voice, athleticism and endurance, its extraordinary speed {{has given rise}} to the nickname [...] "Greyhound among the French hounds".|$|R
