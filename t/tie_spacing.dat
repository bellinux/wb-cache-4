The resulting design method will restrict the buckling-induced reduction of average compressive stress of main bars to an allowable limit until the desired level of ductility is attained.

Based on an average compressive stress-strain relationship of reinforcing bars, evaluation of bar buckling parameter (a function of slenderness ratio and yield strength of the bar) required to restrict the loss of compressive stress at the maximum compressive strain to a tolerable limit is then explained.

The incomplete understanding of the inelastic performance of ICEB building systems limits widespread acceptance of this structural system in earthquake prone areas. This thesis presents results from an experimental program designed to explore the behavior of ICEB walls, built according to current design practice in Indonesia and Thailand, and subjected to out-of-plane loading. A total of five reinforced and grouted ICEB walls were constructed and tested. Results from experimentation show the current masonry design code, ACI 530, adequately predicts the yield strength of these walls. However, ACI 530 grossly over-predicts the ICEB wall stiffness. All tests showed flexural behavior and failure, except for one wall. A brittle failure was observed in one wall before reaching the predicted flexural strength, prompting a suggested maximum shear <b>tie</b> <b>spacing.</b> The testing results provide useful data for developing analytical models that predicts the seismic behavior of ICEB walls under out-of-plane loading. A moment-curvature relationship was developed that accurately predicts the behavior of these walls in the elastic range {{as well as the}} inelastic range. By comparing the data provided by two walls of similar sizes, one including a pilaster and one without a pilaster, insight into stiffener elements was gained. Analysis of these two walls provides a limit on the length and height of ICEB walls without stiffener elements to prevent significant structural damage during a seismic event.

40|$|ConfInement {{effect in}} {{flexural}} ductility of concrete: three-dimensional analysis Z. P. Bazant (1), M. C. Burrow (2) To study {{the effect of}} the transverse stress and strain distribution and steel ties (stirrups) upon the ultimate bending moment and bending ductility, a three-dimensional finite element analys!s of a cross section slice is carried out. The slice consists of a layer of eight-node isoparametnc elements, whose axial displacements are constrained so that the cross sections remain planar but not orthogonal. This allows interpreting the results in terms of curvature, bending moment, axialforce and shear force. Each element within the layer is allowed to independently undergo cracking when its tensile strength limit is exceeded, and the incremental inelastic stiffness matrix of the cracked material is derived. The inelastic behavior of uncracked concrete or concrete between the cracks is modeled by the previously published endochronic theory, which allows representing the inelastic dilatancy due to shear, the hydrostatic pressure sensitivity, and the strain-softening (decrease of stress at increasing strain). The use of a constitutive relation that is capable of describing these effects is essential, since the dilatancy of concrete is opposed by ties which thus produce hydrostatic pressure in concrete thereby increasing its ductility. Transverse reiriforcement is modeled either as reiriforcement smeared throughout an element or as a steel bar connecting the nodes. Special measures are taken to eliminate spurious shear effects in the finite element model. A computer program to calculate the moment-curvature diagram of a given beam has been written using the incremental loading procedure. The calculated results compare satisfactorily with the available published test data on the effect of <b>tie</b> <b>spacing</b> upon the moment-curvature diagrams and flexural ductility...|$|E

The first perching sites addressed at MKE were six lamp posts {{at the base of the}} 128 th Air Refueling Wing of the Wisconsin Air National Guard, which were used daily by red-tailed hawks. In order to mitigate the perching, umbrella skeletons (Daddi Long Legs™ or Bird Spider™) were recommended to be attached to the top of each lamp post. After installation of the skeletons, perching was reduced from daily to none. The effectiveness of the skeletons on the lamp posts led to a consultation with FAA technicians to request the skeletons be placed on top of several pieces of FAA equipment (i. e., glide slope towers). During these same meetings, the technicians stated plastic cable ties could be used on the antennae and obstruction lights on the glide slopes as a deterrent for red-tailed hawk perching. It has been commonly mentioned that these devices cannot be installed because of interference with sensitive equipment; therefore, an evaluation was conducted. Cable ties and an umbrella skeleton were attached to one of three glide slopes and a flight check was conducted to determine if these devices might interfere with equipment operation. Anti-perching equipment did not interfere with glide slope operation; therefore, an umbrella skeleton and cable ties are scheduled to be placed on one additional glide slope at MKE.

These failure mechanisms were identified from model studies on circular type cofferdams are applied independent of cofferdam geometry. It is common to use diaphragm type cofferdams. To asses the validity of common failure mechanisms associated with cellular cofferdams when applied to diaphragm type cofferdams, a series of numerical modelling analyses were conducted. These were validated using field monitoring results of a large scale diaphragm type cofferdam constructed at St. Germans, Norfolk, UK. A series of plane strain analyses of a diaphragm type cofferdam were conducted using the geometry from a critical section of cofferdam. These analyses identified the lowest factor of safety based on the drained strength of the clay on which the cofferdam was constructed. The water level within the river was increased to accommodate flooding and soil strength was reduced to identify the general failure mechanism. The structural forces were calculated using both 2 D and 3 D models for a larger width section (13 m wide) to allow comparison with wall bending moments and displacements measured in field. The 3 D analyses used actual <b>tie</b> <b>spacing</b> and membrane effects whilst reducing the lateral stiffness of the wall to accommodate the stiffness reduction due to variation in the interlock forces.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{finite element}} (FE) model of railway vehicle-track system is developed {{to study the}} dynamic interaction between the vehicle and track. The vehicle is represented by a lumped parameter system. The track is modeled as a Timoshenko beam on discrete pad-tie-ballast supports. The tie is considered either as a rigid body or a non-uniform beam. The rail-pad and ballast are modeled as distributed spring-damper elements. The non-linear factors such as loss of wheel/rail contact, rail lift-off from the tie and tie lift-off from the ballast are taken into account. A cutting and merging method along {{with a set of}} special boundary conditions is established to extend finite length of track to infinitely long track so that a vehicle can be modeled to travel on the track indefinitely with a time-dependent speed. A numerical direct integration technique is employed to solve the equations of motions of the vehicle and track systems. An adaptive multi-point wheel/rail contact model is proposed and used to calculate the normal and geometrical longitudinal forces due to irregularities in the wheel/rail contact region. The developed FE model is validated using the experimental data obtained from British Rail and Canadian Pacific (CP) Rail. The FE results such as natural frequencies of concrete ties, the wheel/rail contact forces, the rail-pad forces and dynamic strains in the rail, generally show good correlation to the experimental data. The validated model is applied to investigate the characteristics of impact loads due to wheel/rail tread defects such as wheel flats, wheel shells and rail joints. The steady-state interaction between the vehicle and track, and the dynamic force due to rail corrugations are evaluated for high speed operation. The results of this study show that the impact load is maximum at the ties, and is strongly influenced by the axle load, vehicle speed, actual shape of the defect, and rail equivalent mass. Elastomeric shear pads on the wheelset bearing, and reduced rail-pad stiffness, can potentially reduce dynamic bearing force and tie dynamic load, respectively. The magnitude of resonant force for vehicle-track system in a steady-state interaction mainly depends on the unsprung mass, <b>tie</b> <b>spacing,</b> vehicle primary and track ballast damping, and rail stiffness. In the presence of rail corrugation, the energy consumption due to longitudinal force increases quadratically with the depth of rail corrugation. The dynamic contact forces at neighboring wheels are influenced by each other and the basic mechanism that control such an interaction is the superposition of the dynamic responses. Stable solution in the speed range 0 to 1440 km/h demonstrates the effectiveness of the model for high speed simulation...|$|E
