5|$|With {{the effects}} of the late-2000s {{recession}} reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic mimosa. In September, a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, but that was only half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011. Oatmeal {{has been shown to be}} a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation and perception as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other, similar products such as grits.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the answers}} {{generated}} by seeming paradoxes like these {{is that there is}} no contradiction - that there is a false dilemma. Dr. Christopher Kaczor suggested that the need <b>to</b> <b>change</b> indicates a lack of power rather than the possession thereof, and as such a person who was omniscient would never need <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>mind</b> - not changing the future would be consistent with omniscience rather than contradicting it.|$|R

25|$|In the 5th century, Saint Augustine wrote The Literal Meaning of Genesis {{in which}} he argued that Genesis should be {{interpreted}} as God forming the Earth and life from pre-existing matter and allowed for an allegorical interpretation of {{the first chapter of}} Genesis. For example: he argues that the six-day structure of creation presented in the book of Genesis represents a logical framework, rather than the passage of time in a physical way. On the other hand, Augustine called for a historical view of the remainder of the history recorded in Genesis, including the creation of Adam and Eve, and the Flood. Apart from his specific views, Augustine recognizes that the interpretation of the creation story is difficult, and remarks that Christians should be willing <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> about it as new information comes up. He also warned believers not to rashly interpret things literally that might be allegorical, as it would discredit the faith.|$|E

25|$|Overall, the C-46 {{had been}} {{successful}} in its primary role as a wartime cargo transport, and had benefited {{from a series of}} improvements. Like the C-47/DC-3, the C-46 seemed destined for a useful career as a postwar civilian passenger airliner, and was considered for that purpose by Eastern Airlines. However, the high operating costs of the C-46 (up to 50% greater than the C-47), soon caused most operators <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> Consequently, most postwar C-46 operations were limited to commercial cargo transport, and then only for certain routes. One of the C-46's major drawbacks was the prodigious fuel consumption of its powerful 2,000hp engines, which used fuel at a much higher rate than the C-47/DC-3. Maintenance was also more intensive and costlier. Despite these disadvantages, surplus C-46s were used by some air carriers, including Capitol, Flying Tigers, Civil Air Transport (CAT) and World Airways to both carry cargo and passengers. Many other small carriers also eventually operated the type on both scheduled and non-scheduled routes. The C-46 became a common sight in South America, and was widely used in Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Argentina and Chile, especially in mountainous areas (where a good climb rate and high service ceiling were required) or to overfly deep jungle terrain where ground transport was impracticable.|$|E

They wanted the actor to shave off his head {{in preparation for the}} experimentation scene in Walter's lab, but Orth successfully [...] "begged" [...] them <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> When casting for the part of Grant, the writers looked for a man similar in appearance to previous character John Scott (Mark Valley), as they wanted [...] "to play into whatever Olivia's feelings about how she was or was not betrayed by John".

500|$|When Menem {{began his}} presidency, there was massive {{hyperinflation}} and a recession. Most economists {{of the time}} thought that the ideal solution was the Washington Consensus: reduce expenditures below {{the amount of money}} earned by the state, and open [...] international commerce to free trade. Alfonsín had proposed similar plans in the past, alongside some privatization; but those projects were resisted by the PJ. The plan was resisted by factions benefiting from the protectionist policies, but the magnitude of the crisis convinced most politicians <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> Menem, fearing that the crisis might force him to resign as well, embraced the Washington Consensus and rejected the traditional policies of Peronism. He invited the conservative politicians Álvaro Alsogaray and María Julia Alsogaray into his cabinet, as well as businessmen from Bunge and Born.|$|E

500|$|Goldwater mathematically {{secured the}} {{nomination}} after winning an additional 56 delegates at the Texas Republican Convention in Dallas on June 16. His {{address to the}} convention drew 11,000 people to the Dallas Memorial Auditorium, where he proclaimed that it was essential for Republicans {{to win in the}} south, after years of [...] "writing off" [...] the region. Although Goldwater had surpassed the number of delegates needed for the Republican nomination, only 361 were bound by state law, slightly leaving the door open for a battle at the convention if his remaining 316 delegates chose to waver. Scranton hoped <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> and took control of a semi-revived Stop Goldwater movement, campaigning nationwide and labeling Goldwater as unqualified. While Scranton gained the support of Henry Cabot Lodge, who resigned his post in Vietnam to assist the campaign, Goldwater requested that Lodge give an update on the progress in Vietnam, but the former ambassador refused, saying that the war should not be a political issue. Goldwater took a further hit after voting against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, questioning its constitutionality. His vote was denounced by the NAACP, who publicly voiced their opposition to Goldwater, breaking their tradition of neutrality during presidential elections. But the vote helped Goldwater among southern Democrats. After returning from Washington, Goldwater briefly returned to Phoenix to attend his daughter's wedding, which received a great deal of media coverage. He then traveled to the midwest and the eastern seaboard to continue to build support for his candidacy. Polls from late June, showed that in a head to head match up, Republicans favored Scranton over Goldwater as Scranton escalated his attacks, labeling Goldwater's policy positions as [...] "ignorant" [...] with the convention just twelve days away.|$|E
500|$|The {{time machine}} gets {{destroyed}} {{so the two}} Candaces go to the backyard to convince the boys to fix the current time machine in the museum and take them back, creating a paradox and as a result, the Candace from the bleak future(wearing a white lab coat {{as seen in the}} picture above) ceases to exist. The boys then fix the machine. Isabella says to Ferb that a rollercoaster ride and time travel was a bonus. The present Candace tags along with her future self, Phineas, Ferb, and Isabella as they travel to the future (while Candace [...] "finally" [...] busting them in the process, but the future Linda is not angry at the boys, saying she doesn't have jurisdiction to bust the boys anymore). As Candace and the boys talk to the future Linda, Isabella sparks an idea and travels back in time. After returning to the present time, Candace leaves in victory, now happy that she had finally (but not technically) busted her brothers. During the credits, it reveals Isabella obtained the tool and gave it to the boys before they even time traveled in the first place. This causes them <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> about going into the future, thus, canceling out all the events that happened earlier in the episode and also causing all the characters involved in the future to cease existence (also erasing the [...] "busting" [...] present Candace caused, thus possibly causing a time loop).

500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E

We {{study the}} effect of {{participative}} decision making in an experimental principal-agent game, where the principal can consult the agent’s preferred option regarding the task to be undertaken in {{the final stage of}} the game. We show that consulting the agent was beneficial to principals as long as they followed the agent’s choice. Ignoring the agent’s choice was detrimental to the principal as it engendered negative emotions and low levels of transfers. Nevertheless, the majority of principals were reluctant <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>mind</b> and adopt the agent’s proposal.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to study the {{relationship}} between regret and changing your mind in decisions {{where there is a}} time period between the choice and when the outcome is revealed. Do people experience regret before as well as after the outcome is known? If so, do they experience more regret after the outcome if they have the option <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>mind,</b> and do so? To answer these two questions three experiments were performed. In Study 1 and Study 2 the participants were given the impression that the result was at least partly based on their skill in offering money to a simulated opponent. Half the participants were given the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>their</b> <b>mind.</b> In the first study the participants' reported regret before the outcome was significantly higher than the regret reported post-outcome, while in the second study it was equal. In both studies those who <b>changed</b> <b>their</b> choice before the outcome reported more regret both not only before, but also after the outcome, compared to those who did not <b>change.</b> <b>To</b> further explore the effect of changing your mind a third study was performed. Even when changing your mind was the best strategy those who did so reported a higher amount of regret than those who did not. Results indicate that there is a significant amount of regret before the outcome is known, and that the act of changing your mind has an effect on the amount of experienced post-outcome regret...|$|R
