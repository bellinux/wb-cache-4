25|$|In contrast, pro-angiogenic protein therapy uses well-defined, {{precisely}} structured proteins, with previously defined optimal {{doses of}} the individual protein for disease states, and with well-known biological effects. On the other hand, an obstacle of protein therapy is the mode of delivery. Oral, intravenous, intra-arterial, or intramuscular routes of protein administration are not always as effective, as the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>protein</b> may be metabolized or cleared before it can enter the target tissue. Cell-based pro-angiogenic therapies are still early stages of research, with many open questions regarding best cell types and dosages to use.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of {{pharmacodynamics}} (what a drug does to the body), the hydrophobic effect is the major driving force for the binding of drugs to their receptor targets. [...] On the other hand, hydrophobic drugs {{tend to be more}} toxic because they, in general, are retained longer, have a wider distribution within the body (e.g., intracellular), are somewhat less selective in their binding to proteins, and finally are often extensively metabolized. In some cases the metabolites may be chemically reactive. [...] Hence it is advisable to make the drug as hydrophilic as possible while it still retains adequate binding affinity to the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>protein</b> target. For cases where a drug reaches its target locations through passive mechanisms (i.e., diffusion through membranes), the ideal distribution coefficient for the drug is typically intermediate in value (neither too lipophilic, nor too hydrophilic); in cases where molecules reach their targets otherwise, no such generalization applies.|$|E

40|$|Immunogenicity of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>proteins</b> lowers patient {{well-being}} and drastically increases therapeutic costs. Preventing immunogenicity {{is an important}} issue to consider when developing novel <b>therapeutic</b> <b>proteins</b> and applying them in the clinic. Animal models are increasingly used to study immunogenicity of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>proteins.</b> They are employed as predictive tools to assess different aspects of immunogenicity during drug development and have become vital in studying the mechanisms underlying immunogenicity of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>proteins.</b> However, the use of animal models needs critical evaluation. Because of species differences, predictive value of such models is limited, and mechanistic studies can be restricted.

50|$|Recombinant {{therapeutic}} proteins are of {{a complex}} nature (composed of a long chain of amino acids, modified amino acids, derivatized by sugar moieties, folded by complex mechanisms). These proteins are made in living cells (bacteria, yeast, animal or human cell lines). The ultimate characteristics of a drug containing a recombinant <b>therapeutic</b> <b>protein</b> are to a large part determined by the process through which they are produced: choice of the cell type, development of the genetically modified cell for production, production process, purification process, formulation of the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>protein</b> into a drug.|$|E
50|$|Receptor-mediated transcytosis, or RMT, {{across the}} BBB is a {{potential}} pathway for drug delivery to the brain, particularly for biologic drugs such as recombinant proteins. The non-transportable drug, or <b>therapeutic</b> <b>protein,</b> is genetically fused to a transporter protein. The transporter protein may be an endogenous peptide, or peptidomimetic monoclonal antibody, which undergoes RMT across the BBB via transport on brain endothelial receptors such as the insulin receptor or transferrin receptor. The transporter protein acts as a molecular Trojan horse to ferry into brain the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>protein</b> that is genetically fused to the receptor-specific Trojan horse protein.|$|E
5000|$|PEGylation (often styled pegylation) is {{the process}} of both {{covalent}} and non-covalent attachment or amalgamation of polyethylene glycol (PEG, in pharmacy called macrogol) polymer chains to molecules and macrostructures, such as a drug, <b>therapeutic</b> <b>protein</b> or vesicle, which is then described as PEGylated (pegylated). PEGylation is routinely achieved by incubation of a reactive derivative of PEG with the target molecule. The covalent attachment of PEG to a drug or <b>therapeutic</b> <b>protein</b> can [...] "mask" [...] the agent from the host's immune system (reduced immunogenicity and antigenicity), and increase the hydrodynamic size (size in solution) of the agent which prolongs its circulatory time by reducing renal clearance. PEGylation can also provide water solubility to hydrophobic drugs and proteins.|$|E

40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made in understanding pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), as well as toxicity profiles of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>proteins</b> in animals and humans, which have been in commercial development for more than three decades.

Investigative and bioanalytical tools need to be established to improve the translation of PK data from animals to humans, and from in vitro assays to in vivo readouts, which would ultimately lead to a higher success rate in drug development. In toxicology, it is known, in general, what studies are needed to safely develop <b>therapeutic</b> <b>proteins,</b> and what studies do not provide relevant information. One of the major complicating factors in nonclinical and clinical programs for <b>therapeutic</b> <b>proteins</b> is the impact of immunogenicity.

Herein, using a unique polymer family with a wide-ranging set of cationic and hydrophobic features, we developed a novel nanoparticle (NP) platform capable of installing protein ligands on the particle surface and simultaneously carrying <b>therapeutic</b> <b>proteins</b> inside by a self-assembly procedure. The loaded <b>therapeutic</b> <b>proteins</b> (e. g., insulin) within the NPs exhibited sustained and tunable release, while the surface-coated protein ligands (e. g., transferrin) were demonstrated to alter the NP cellular behaviors. In vivo results revealed that the transferrin-coated NPs can effectively be transported across the intestinal epithelium for oral insulin delivery, leading to a notable hypoglycemic response.
