5|$|Geoffrey's {{ordination}} as {{a priest}} took place at Southwell on 23 September 1189, in a ceremony performed by John the Bishop of Whithorn. Geoffrey then went to York, but until his election was ratified by the pope he refused to allow Burchard to take up his office. This stance was supported {{by most of the}} York cathedral chapter. Geoffrey then was sent by Richard to escort William the Lion from Scotland to Canterbury. It was at Canterbury that papal assent to Geoffrey's election was secured in December, when Giovanni d'Anagni, the papal legate, not only confirmed the election, but rejected the various appeals made by the cathedral chapter against Geoffrey. But the king forced Geoffrey to allow the royal appointments, and pay a fine of £2000 before his lands were restored, although Geoffrey was allowed some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> full payment.|$|E
5|$|The East Stand at Old Trafford was {{the second}} to be {{converted}} to a cantilever roof, following the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand. It is also {{commonly referred to as}} the Scoreboard End, as it was the location of the scoreboard. The East Stand can currently hold nearly 12,000fans, and is the location of both the disabled fans section and the away section; an experiment involving the relocation of away fans to the third tier of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand was conducted during the 2011–12 season, but the results of the experiments could not be ascertained in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> move permanent for the 2012–13 season. The disabled section provides for up to 170 fans, with free seats for carers. Old Trafford was formerly divided into sections, with each section sequentially assigned a letter of the alphabet. Although every section had a letter, it is the K Stand that is the most commonly referred to today. The K Stand fans were renowned for their vocal support for the club, and a large array of chants and songs, though many of them have relocated to the second tier of the West Stand.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{industries}} {{where it is}} critical to make a correct decision within a strict time limit, based on the decision-maker’s knowledge of the current situation: for example air traffic controllers or surgeons. In these situations it is common that the key decision maker is supported by other team members or by complex monitoring systems feeding them information, which can involve multiple sources and formats of information. Even in these time-critical situations, the importance of having situation awareness (SA) is not constant: i.e. it is more critical to the outcome to have better SA for non-standard situations, such as points of high information traffic, extraneous activity and unforeseeable events. These ‘points of fracture’ are likely to cause additional workload on the individuals and therefore affect their SA and the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> decision. At the critical point the perceived situational awareness utilized to make the decision is directly affected by the cognitive workload to gain, comprehend and process the SA that is coming in to the operator, both general background SA and the SA specifically related to the decision. (Smith, K. T. 2013) In other words, if everything is going OK the level of SA you have is not as critical as it is when something unusual happens or something goes wrong.|$|E

A show insider revealed that [...] "Tom’s departure will leave his fans in tears, but Holby bosses are keeping tight-lipped {{about whether or not}} Sam will be killed off." [...] Chambers explained of his decision to leave: [...] "I was worried about telling the bosses, but I wrote a long letter to the producers explaining my decision and they were incredibly nice about it.

500|$|The sibling aliens Kang and Kodos first {{appeared}} on the show on this episode. Every Treehouse of Horror episode since this one must have Kang and Kodos as characters, states an unofficial Simpsons rule. Despite this rule, the writers say the duo will often be forgotten and then added at the last second, leading to brief appearances. The idea of Kang and Kodos came from Kogen and Wolodarsky. In the script, Kang and Kodos were shown as [...] "an octopus in a space helmet with a trail of goo". The finished design {{was based on the}} cover of an EC Comics issue. Although originally designed to constantly drool, Groening suggested that they not drool all the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> animation process easier. However, the animators did not mind the work, leading to the drooling staying in the script. Kang and Kodos's names are derived from two [...] characters. Kang was a Klingon captain portrayed by actor Michael Ansara in the episode [...] "Day of the Dove", whereas Kodos the Executioner was a human villain from [...] "The Conscience of the King". Harry Shearer voices Kang, and Dan Castellaneta voices Kodos.|$|E

500|$|While {{working at}} Humongous, Soule met fellow {{employee}} and video game designer Chris Taylor, and {{signed on to}} compose the soundtrack to his major project, Total Annihilation. Soule convinced Taylor that, given {{the large amount of}} other real-time strategy games coming out {{at the same time as}} Total Annihilation with techno scores, that to separate themselves they needed to do a large orchestral score. He went so far as to bet a year's worth of reduced pay that it would pay off; Gilbert felt that it did after the first sentence of the first review of the game he read was about the music. Given the software limitations at the <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> sound work correctly required a full live orchestra, the first that Soule had ever worked with; the orchestral tracks in Evermore had been performed by Soule and his brother by themselves, two instruments at a time.

Rob Bowman and Alex Proyas were also rumored to be up for consideration, though Proyas personally turned it down, citing feuds with 20th Century Fox president Thomas Rothman while producing I, Robot. Zack Snyder was also approached, but he was already committed to 300. Peter Berg was also considered to direct the film but he too turned down the job.
