25|$|In 1967, Arthur Lowe {{returned}} as Leonard Swindley in <b>Turn</b> <b>Out</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lights,</b> a short-lived sequel to Pardon the Expression. It ran {{for just one}} series of six episodes before it was cancelled.|$|E
25|$|By the 1960s, Lowe {{had made}} the {{transition}} to television and landed a regular role as draper/lay preacher Leonard Swindley in the northern drama series Coronation Street (1960–65). His character became sufficiently popular with viewers for him {{to appear in the}} spin-off series, Pardon the Expression (1966) and its sequel <b>Turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lights</b> (1967). Leonard Swindley was not a role Lowe relished and he longed to move on. During the months he was not playing Swindley, he was busy on stage or making one-off guest appearances in other TV series such as Z-Cars (1962) and The Avengers (1967).|$|E
25|$|Detective Tom (Sean Patrick Flanery) and {{his partner}} Ryan Alba (Greg Serano) {{have spent the last}} three years unsuccessfully trying to locate the Lion (Joe Pantoliano), an {{international}} hitman that has always eluded their grasp. They believe that they've found his location via a tipster but instead find Tom’s wife Kelly (Michelle Greathouse) tied up in a basement filled with explosives, surrounded by a black outline. The Lion calls Tom and commands him to kill Kelly or risk the entire house blowing up and killing everyone inside. Any attempt to evacuate the house or rescue Kelly will result in everyone getting blown up and the Lion will not accept any substitutions, as he wants Tom to suffer for messing up the Lion's network in the Southwestern United States. His only mercy is that Tom may <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> in the basement. With no other option, Tom has the lights turned off and he shoots and kills Kelly.|$|E

500|$|Hubbard {{characterized}} her composition {{style as}} [...] "impressionistic paintings in music", {{in an interview}} with the St. Petersburg Times. She commented, [...] "My music is for the time when people want to <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights,</b> listen and escape into another world ... to dream places ... to little magical places in which the listener can participate and become involved." [...] Regarding a potential audience, Hubbard said, [...] "My music is for intelligent listeners, who don't mind if I change chords, and are willing to see what happens next." [...] Explaining why written text did not accompany the songs, Hubbard said, [...] "I wrote lots of poetry. But somehow it didn't feel right to have lyrics with the pieces – I'd rather leave that slot open for the listener." ...|$|E
500|$|Louis Dow {{had died}} in 1944, with Frances Hand at his side. The Hands' {{marriage}} then entered its final, happiest phase, in which they rediscovered their first love. Former law clerks have provided intimate details of Hand's character {{during the last decade}} of his life. Legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin recalls that Hand, scrupulous about public economy, used to <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> in all the offices {{at the end of each}} day. For the same reason, he refused Dworkin the customary month's paid vacation at the end of his service. Shortly afterward, to Dworkin's surprise, Hand wrote him a personal check for an extra month's pay as a wedding present. Hand was known for his explosive temper. Gunther remembers him throwing a paperweight in his direction which narrowly missed. Hand had a habit of turning his seat 180° on lawyers whose arguments annoyed him, and he could be bitingly sarcastic. In a typical memo, he wrote, [...] "This is the most miserable of cases, but we must dispose of it as though it had been presented by actual lawyers." [...] Despite such outbursts, Hand was deeply insecure throughout his life, as he fully recognized. In his 80s, he still fretted about his rejection by the elite social clubs at Harvard College. He was convinced that his wife had rescued him from a life as a [...] "melancholic, a failure [...] I should have thought myself so, and probably single and hopelessly hypochondriac".|$|E

Sue's table had a moderate show, two men in their filigree and velvet frames standing together beside her looking-glass.|$|E

60|$|They {{left the}} room together. She looked {{back for a moment}} before, they {{disappeared}} and Arnold felt his heart give a little jump. She was certainly the most beautiful creature he had ever seen, and there was something in her treatment of him, the subtle flattery of her half appealing confidence, which went to his head like wine. The door closed and he was left alone. He listened to their departing footsteps. Then he looked around him, for the first time forming some idea of his surroundings. He was in a very charming, comfortable-looking apartment, with deep easy-chairs, a divan covered with luxurious cushions, numbers of little tables covered with photographs and flowers, a great bowl of hot-house roses, and an oak cabinet with an oak background in the further corner of the room, which was packed with curios. After his first brief inspection, however, he felt scarcely any curiosity as to the contents of the room. It was the window which drew him always towards It. Once more he peered through the chink of the curtains. He had not cared to <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights,</b> however, and for several moments everything was indistinguishable. Then he saw that the two figures still remained in very nearly the same position, except that they had drawn, if anything, a little closer to the house.|$|E
