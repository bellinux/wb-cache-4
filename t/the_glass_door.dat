5|$|The gunfight {{was not the}} end of the conflict. On December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp was ambushed and maimed in {{a murder}} attempt by the Cowboys. On March 18, 1882, Cowboys fired from a dark alley through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> of a saloon, killing Morgan Earp. The {{suspects}} in both incidents furnished alibis supplied by other Cowboys and were not indicted. Wyatt Earp, newly appointed as Deputy U.S. Marshal in Cochise County, then took matters into his own hands in a personal vendetta. He was pursued by county sheriff Johnny Behan, who had received a warrant from Tucson for Wyatt's shooting of Frank Stilwell.|$|E

500|$|The alpha male stops its {{attack on}} <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>door,</b> making a butterfly-shaped smear on it. Neville realizes the alpha male is {{identifying}} the female upon {{which he was}} experimenting by a butterfly tattoo, and the Darkseekers simply want her back. Amazed {{that they have the}} intelligence to try and communicate to him, as he had previously believed the infected had lost all humanity, Neville puts his gun down and returns the female. After Neville wakes the female up, she cries upon seeing the alpha male and they rub heads. Neville softly apologizes, having realised that while the Darkseekers are no longer human, they still retain some of their humanity and emotions. The alpha male keeps the other Darkseekers back and orders them to leave. Shocked by the ordeal, Neville sits down for a moment in his laboratory, realizing that he was the monster in the Darkseekers' eyes. Looking over the pictures of his numerous test subjects, the implications of his research methods begin to dawn on him, causing him to feel remorse and relief at the same time. The following day, Neville, Anna, and Ethan drive away from the city under a new broadcast, recorded by Anna, with a message to any human survivors that they [...] "are not alone".|$|E

2500|$|During {{a lull in}} the riot, a young {{officer on}} Patterson's video appealed for {{understanding}} from the protesters. He tried to calmly tell them how unhappy the police were with the assignment and its aftermath. [...] "We've got cops back there in ambulances who've been hit." [...] But the lull ended. Thirty to seventy protesters re-entered the park. A witness said the mob rammed a police barricade through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> of the Christodora House, a high-rise luxury building on Avenue B. They overturned planters and tore a lamp out of the wall, threatened residents and staff with bodily harm, and screamed and chanted [...] "Die Yuppie Scum". At 6 a.m., the last protesters dispersed, vowing to demonstrate again.|$|E
2500|$|The debut {{episode of}} EastEnders {{began with the}} {{discovery}} of elderly resident Reg Cox's dead body, following his murder by Nick. Holland and Smith wanted to introduce the series in a dramatic fashion, and believed the Reg Cox storyline to be a good starting point, allowing various members of the community to be involved with or comment on the circumstances of the old man's murder. Santer has explained that Nick was established as a [...] "kind of spitting, snarling beast right from the outset", {{with the end of the}} first episode seeing Nick granted EastEnders first drum roll ending as he punched through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> window of The Queen Victoria pub after a fight with Ali Osman. After a few weeks of the police investigation, prime suspect Nick left the Square, and in April it was reported that he had been arrested. After Nick's mother, Dot, was introduced to the cast in July, she informed the audience that Nick had managed to get off on probation, and the following month, he returned to Albert Square. Upon his return, he broke into Harold Legg's surgery and came across Kathy Beale's medical records, discovering she had a child at 14 years old. Nick threatens to reveal this to Kathy's husband, Pete unless she gives him regular payments. Kathy soon tells Pete the truth, resulting in him giving Nick a beating in the middle of the street. Following this, Den warns Nick to leave the square for good, with the exception of visiting Dot occasionally, or he will face fatal consequences.|$|E
