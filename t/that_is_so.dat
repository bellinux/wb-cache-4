25|$|The {{sampling}} theorem was {{implied by}} the work of Harry Nyquist in 1928,nbsp& in which he showed that up to 2B independent pulse samples could be sent through a system of bandwidth B; but he did not explicitly consider the problem of sampling and reconstruction of continuous signals. About the same time, Karl Küpfmüller showed a similar result, and discussed the sinc-function impulse response of a band-limiting filter, via its integral, the step response Integralsinus; this bandlimiting and reconstruction filter <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> central to the sampling theorem is sometimes referred to as a Küpfmüller filter (but seldom so in English).|$|E
25|$|Sorcerer is a 1977 American existential thriller film {{directed}} and produced by William Friedkin and starring Roy Scheider, Bruno Cremer, Francisco Rabal, and Amidou. The second adaptation of Georges Arnaud's 1950 French novel Le Salaire de la peur, {{it has been}} widely considered a remake of the first adaptation, the 1953 film The Wages of Fear. Friedkin, however, has disagreed with this assessment. The plot depicts four outcasts from varied backgrounds meeting in a South American village, where they are assigned to transport cargoes of aged, poorly kept dynamite <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> unstable that it is 'sweating' its dangerous basic ingredient, nitroglycerin.|$|E

25|$|Three years later, Téchiné took on {{biography}} with Les sœurs Brontë The Bronte Sisters (1979). A {{profile of}} the famous Brontë sisters. The film’s heavy, repressive mood evokes the harshness and injustice of the life that the Brontë sisters endured. The passion and color <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> vivid in their novels was absent from their daily existence, and the film’s appropriately gloomy cinematography – which uses dreary earth colors to emphasize the cold, remote feel – evokes this with great poignancy. The film features an all-star cast: Isabelle Adjani, Marie-France Pisier and Isabelle Huppert as Emily, Charlotte and Anne Brontë, with Pascal Gregory as their ill-fated brother Branwell.|$|E
25|$|Apollonius of Perga, in On Determinate Section, {{dealt with}} {{problems}} {{in a manner that}} may be called an analytic geometry of one dimension; with the question of finding points on a line that were in a ratio to the others. Apollonius in the Conics further developed a method <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> similar to analytic geometry that his work is sometimes thought to have anticipated the work of Descartes by some 1800 years. His application of reference lines, a diameter and a tangent is essentially no different from our modern use of a coordinate frame, where the distances measured along the diameter from the point of tangency are the abscissas, and the segments parallel to the tangent and intercepted between the axis and the curve are the ordinates. He further developed relations between the abscissas and the corresponding ordinates that are equivalent to rhetorical equations of curves. However, although Apollonius came close to developing analytic geometry, he did not manage to do so since he did not take into account negative magnitudes and in every case the coordinate system was superimposed upon a given curve a posteriori instead of a priori. That is, equations were determined by curves, but curves were not determined by equations. Coordinates, variables, and equations were subsidiary notions applied to a specific geometric situation.|$|E
