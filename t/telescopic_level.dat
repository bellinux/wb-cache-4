40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{instrument}} system isdescribed whereby beach profiles may be surveyed by one man {{without the aid}} of a field assistant. The accuracy ofthe method istested and shown to give results within about + _. 07 feet vertically with traverse l gs less than 30 feet in horizontal distance. The procedure has additional ppeal because the equipment is inexpensive and portable and the profile can usually be completed more quickly than by using a level and rod. INTRODU CTION Studies of the coastal zone nearly always in-clude measurements of changes to the subaer-ial beach profile over time. Most commonly, these are carried out at times of low tide, with a <b>telescopic</b> <b>level</b> and a surveying rod. Breaks in slope along the shore-normal profile are marked. Starting with a backsight to a bench-mark on the backshore to establish a "height of instrument, " the survey rod is sighted at each break in slope as the rod man progresses seaward as far as is prudent. Elevations are calculated by subtracting the rod readings from the "height of instrument, " and horizon-tal distances between the stations are calcu-lated from the interval between the upper and lower stadia hairs. This method, with only minor modifica-tions, is the one in most widespread use and has much to recommend it. It is simple, rea-sonably fast, and accurate. K. O. Emery has also developed a useful method of profiling that uses two men and two wooden rods, eliminating the need for a <b>telescopic</b> <b>level</b> (Emery, 1961). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe an alternative method of obtaining beach profiles which, while not intended to replace either of the techniques mentioned above, offers impor-tant advantages in that it is quicker and re-quires only one man with a minimum of equipment to carry out the survey...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} role of metaphorical language in early Buddhist literature {{through the lens of}} two previously unpublished Gāndhārī sūtras on a manuscript from the Robert Senior Collection. At the microscopic level, I offer an edition, translation, and textual analysis of a Buddhist manuscript containing two Saṃyuktāgama-type sūtras written in the Gāndhārī language and Kharoṣṭhī script. I study the writing and language of the manuscript in sections on paleography, orthography, phonology, and morphology. I then offer extensive text notes making sense of the sūtras and comparing them with parallel texts in Pāli, Sanskrit, and Chinese. At the <b>telescopic</b> <b>level,</b> I study the pedagogical and rhetorical functions of metaphorical language, broadly conceived, in early Buddhist literature, particularly through the lens of two evocative similes that are the central motifs of the Gāndhārī sūtras under consideration. The first simile compares a well-defended fortress to a mindful practitioner, while the second compares bodies of people born in hell to a red-hot iron ball. Additionally, I examine a metaphor that compares hell, and also existence in saṃsāra, to a "great conflagration. " Through this analysis, I show that the Gāndhārī similes and metaphor allude to wide-reaching networks of imagery found throughout early Buddhist literature that enhance our interpretation of the Gāndhārī sūtras. Moreover, they illustrate a common didactic strategy, a kind of "pedagogy of metaphor," that was used to engage the imaginations of traditional audiences and convey complex Buddhist teachings...|$|E

Philosopher Sibnarayan Ray commented: Al Mahmud has an extraordinary gift for <b>telescopic</b> discrete <b>levels</b> of experience; in his poems I find a marvelous fusion and wit which reminds me occasionally of Bishnu Dey. The complete secularism of his approach is also striking…he was born and {{brought up in a}} very conservative Muslim religious family; it is not a secularism forced by some ideology, but present naturally and ubiquitously in his metaphors, images and themes.

500|$|Perry was {{succeeded by}} John Grundy, Sr., {{who had arrived}} in the region in 1731 {{at the request of the}} Duke of Buccleuch, who wanted his estates surveyed. Perry was {{building}} the Spalding sluice at the time, and Grundy's work allowed him to study drains, banks, sluices and outfalls. He formed the opinion that mathematical and philosophical principles should be applied to the drainage of low-lying regions. In 1733, he surveyed the parish of Moulton, a little further downstream, to assess how drainage could be improved for the Commissioners of Sewers. He demonstrated the use of a <b>telescopic</b> spirit <b>level,</b> which enabled him to achieve accurate levels, with errors of less than 1 inch per mile (2cm per km). Next he addressed the issue of flow in open drains. Using his mathematical principles, he calculated that water in a drain which was [...] long, and had a fall of [...] over its length should travel at around , taking 1 hour and 28 minutes to travel the length of the drain. Observations in the field showed him that other factors, such as fluid friction, resulted in the actual flow rate being less than half of this. He published a paper of his findings in April 1734, and insisted that accurate mapping and levels, together with physical observation of drains and rivers, were essential to deciding how fenland could best be drained. In the same month, he began working for the Adventurers of Deeping Fen, to produce a drainage scheme. He spent some time mapping [...] of the Welland, and his chief recommendation was for a reservoir and sluice at the outfall of the River Glen, which would enable the outfall to be scoured at low tide, by releasing water from the reservoir.|$|R
