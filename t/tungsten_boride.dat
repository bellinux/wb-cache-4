40|$|<b>Tungsten</b> <b>boride</b> (WB) crystals, whose surface {{tends to}} be {{oxidized}} when exposed to air, were demonstrated to have a comparable activity to platinum as counter electrode material in dye-sensitized solar cells. The synergistic effect of both catalytically active surface layer WOx and electronically conductive internal WB {{is considered to be}} responsible for the high activity of the WB crystals...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{show that}} B 2 O 3 -xNx {{nanoclusters}} can be formed {{on the surface of}} WO 3 particles by a combination of thermal oxidation of <b>tungsten</b> <b>boride</b> (WB) in air and the subsequent nitriding process in gaseous ammonia. The resultant nanoclusters are found to play an apparent role in improving the photocatalytic oxygen evolution of WO 3 by promoting the surface separation of photoexcited charge-carriers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. High {{temperature}} electrochemical {{synthesis of}} <b>tungsten</b> <b>boride</b> has been performed in KF-KCl melts with B 2 O 3 and WO 3 used as reactants at 1033 K. The cathode product {{was investigated in}} the current density range 0. 4 A/cm 2 - 0. 6 A/cm 2 and characterized by means of XRD analyses and SEM. The results indicated that cathode product is mainly consist of W 2 B 5 and WB 4, the powders are fine (＜ 0. 5 um). Current density exert a great effect on the phase composition, particle size and morphology of the cathode product...|$|E
50|$|<b>Tungsten</b> <b>borides</b> are {{compounds}} {{of tungsten}} and boron. Their most remarkable property is high hardness. The Vickers hardness of WB or WB2 crystals is ~20 GPa {{and that of}} WB4 is ~30 GPa for loads exceeding 3 N.|$|R
30|$|It {{was shown}} that the {{corrosion}} resistance in standard nickeling electrolytes for nanopowders of silicon carbide, {{as well as for}} zirconium, titanium, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and <b>tungsten</b> <b>borides</b> and carbides, depends on the acidity of the electrolyte, the temperature, and the treatment duration.|$|R
40|$|Tungsten tetraboride (WB 4) is {{experimentally}} {{considered as}} potentially superhard material {{and is therefore}} expected to have highly structural stability and enhanced resistance against plastic deformation and failure. The examinations of bond-deformation mechanism suggest a significantly soft bond-deformation pattern induced by ionic W-B bonding for nominal WB 4 in experiments, {{largely responsible for the}} limitation of its strength and structural integrity. Computations on the structures and mechanical properties for WB 4 show a novel thermodynamically favored MoB 4 -type phase with excellent mechanical properties and remarkable incompressibility along c direction. The illustrations of nonstoichiometry and x-ray diffraction spectra rationalize the experimental observation of nominal composition WB 4 as defective <b>tungsten</b> <b>borides</b> (W 1 -xB 3 (x 0. 25)). The results provide new insight into the real structural and mechanical properties of <b>tungsten</b> <b>borides...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} coreless {{boron fiber}} exhibits tensile strengths {{which are more}} than twice that of the normal CVD B/W fibers. The coreless fiber is made by the chemical removal of the <b>tungsten</b> <b>boride</b> core exposed by splitting the as-grown fiber. The easily splittable fiber is made by the chemical vapor deposition of boron on a larger than usual tungsten substrate. It is expected that the ease of splitting is related to residual stresses in these fibers. Measurements of the axial residual stresses in both the normal and the splittable fibers are presented and the results compared. Differences in these stresses are discussed in connection with the ease of splitting in the splittable fibers...|$|E
40|$|The boronizing of a {{tungsten}} heavy alloy containing Ni and Fe as {{the major}} alloying elements were performed {{in the present study}} to increase its surface hardening. Pack cementation method was employed as a well-known, successful solid-state process for boronizing. The coating treatment was accomplished at different temperatures of 1000, 1050 and 1100 °C for 6 and 9 hours. The formation of <b>tungsten</b> <b>boride</b> phase was confirmed, although a silicide layer covered the surface of the specimen as the outer layer. The mechanism of the formation of a multilayered surface was explained. The maximum thickness of reaction zone and surface hardness achieved in the current work were 300 µm and 2470 HV, respectively...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} measure and understand the physical and mechanical effects that occur in boron fibers during and after thermal treatment in a controlled oxygen argon gaseous mixture. Of principal concern was the optimization of this treatment as a secondary processing method for significantly improving fiber tensile strength. Strengthening was accomplished by an oxidation induced axial contraction of the fiber and a resulting axial compression of strength limiting flaws within the fiber's <b>tungsten</b> <b>boride</b> core. Various physical observations were used to develop mechanistic models for oxidation, contraction, and flow formation. Processing guidelines are discussed for possibly exceeding the 5. 5 GN/sq m strength limit and also for achieving fiber strengthening during application of boron containing diffusion barrier coatings...|$|E
5000|$|In the {{production}} process, elemental boron is deposited {{on an even}} tungsten wire substrate which produces diameters of 4.0 mil (102 micron) and 5.6 mil (142 micron). It consists of a fully <b>borided</b> <b>tungsten</b> core with amorphous boron.|$|R
40|$|By {{measuring}} {{the change in}} fracture stress of 203 micrometer diameter fibers of boron on tungsten (B/W) {{as a function of}} fiber diameter as reduced by chemical etching, it is shown that the flaws which limit B/W fiber strength are located at the surface and in the <b>tungsten</b> <b>boride</b> core. After etching to a diameter of 188 micrometers m virtually all fiber fractures were caused by core flaws, the average strength being 4. 50 GN/sq m. If both the surface and core flaws are removed, the fracture strength, limited by flaws in the boron itself, is approximately 6. 89 GN/sq m. This was measured on B/W fibers which were split longitudinally and had their cores removed by chemical etching. The longitudinal residual stress distribution was determined for 102 micrometer diameter B/W and B/C fibers...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the physical and mechanical effects of thermal treatment in a controlled oxygen-argon atmosphere on boron fibers is reported, with attention to the optimization of such treatment as a secondary processing method for improvement of fiber strength. The strengthening mechanism is comprised of an oxidation-induced axial contraction of the fiber, accompanied by axial compression of strength-limiting flaws within the fiber's <b>tungsten</b> <b>boride</b> core. It was found that after an oxidation contraction of 0. 3 % near 900 C, and a slight surface etch near 100 C, the average tensile strength of 203 -micron fibers increased from 500 to 800 ksi. Various physical observations are used to develop mechanistic models of oxidation, contraction, {{and the formation of}} new flaws in the boron sheath at contractions greater than 0. 3 %...|$|E
40|$|Improvement in the {{strain-to-failure}} of chemical-vapor-deposition boron fibers {{is shown}} possible by contracting the <b>tungsten</b> <b>boride</b> core region and its inherent flaws. Results of three methods {{are presented in}} which etching and thermal-processing techniques were employed to achieve core flaw contraction by internal stresses available in the boron sheath. After commercially and treatment-induced surface flaws were removed from 203 -micron (8 -mil) fibers, the core flaw was observed to be essentially {{the only source of}} fiber fracture. Thus, fiber strain-to-failure was found to improve by an amount equal to the treatment-induced contraction on the core flaw. To date, average fracture strains and stresses greater than 1. 4 % and 5. 5 GN/sq m (800 ksi), respectively, have been achieved. Commercial feasibility considerations suggest as the most cost-effective technique that method in which as-produced fibers are given a rapid heat treatment above 700 C. Preliminary results concerning the contraction kinetics and fracture behavior observed with this technique are presented and discussed for both high-vacuum and argon-gas heat-treatment environments...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{measuring}} axial residual stresses in boron fibers is presented. With this method, the axial residual stress distribution {{as a function}} of radius is determined from the fiber surface to the core including the average residual stress in the core. Such measurements on boron on tungsten (B/W) fibers show that the residual stresses for 102, 142, 203, and 366 micron diam fibers are similar, being compressive at the surface and changing monotonically to a region of tensile stress within the boron. At approximately 25 % of the original radius, the stress reaches a maximum tensile stress of about 860 MN sq m and then decreases to a compressive stress near the <b>tungsten</b> <b>boride</b> core. Data are presented for 203 -micron diam B/W fibers that show annealing above 900 C reduces the residual stresses. A comparison between 102 -micron diam B/W and boron on carbon (B/C) show that the residual stresses are similar in the outer regions of the fibers, but that large differences near and in the core are observed. Fracture of boron fibers is discussed...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{believe that}} {{development}} of {{wear resistant coating}} compositions basedon W Bis an important task aimed at improvement of durability of working parts of 2 2 machines. X-ray analysis of coating composition W B – FeCr – FeV {{is presented in the}} 2 2 article. The results of chemical and X-ray analyses of the coating composition comprisingW B – FeCr – 10 % FeV demonstrate that, when the weld metal formed, W Bpartially 2 5 2 5 dissociates to form borides, vanadium, iron, and chromium. High iron content in thesolid solution causes reduction of its hardness and wear resistance. A 20 % increase in the <b>tungsten</b> <b>boride</b> content leads to formation of elongated grains in the matrix of ironborides, vanadium and chromium borides. A composition containing 4 % of W Bhas a 2 5 fine-grained structure, and it is characterized by the absence of FeB in the weld metal,and its absence means lower brittleness. In the metal, carbon borides are formed to assure its high hardness. In the matrix, a significant amount of vanadium and chromium is dissolved to help improve its hardness. The study shows that the composition containing 40 % of W Bhas a fine-grained structure, and it is characterized by the absence of FeB 2 5 in the weld metal. Therefore, the coating layer demonstrates the highest resistance toabrasion. Исследована структура наплавленного металла на основе W B.

40|$|Cubic {{boron nitride}} (c-BN) {{possesses}} excellent hardness, being the second hardest material after diamond. Thanks to its high abrasion resistance with ferrous alloys and oxidation resistance, c-BN {{is used for}} machining elements where diamond is weak. When sintering c-BN powder with other binders, some swelling and shrinkage occur at the pre-sintering step {{in the production of}} grinding and cutting tools at the company Element Six (E 6), but the complicated physicochemical reactions taking place are not fully understood. Its study is then of great interest from the technological point of view, as the production of such tools could be improved. Two different c-BN powders provided by E 6 were studied in the current project. Heat treatments of both batches (called B and C) were carried out by means of a dilatometer at different temperatures up to 1100 ºC at different heating rates, in two different furnaces, graphite and alumina furnace, and in argon atmosphere and vacuum in order to study the influence of the heating rate, temperature, furnace and atmosphere on both batches. Dilatometry was first used to determine length changes and temperatures where reactions occur, and afterwards X-ray diffractometry (XRD) was used to find out the compounds formed at different temperatures. On the one hand, the study performed on batch B, initially containing c-BN, tungsten (W), tungsten carbide (WC), cobalt (Co), aluminium (Al) and organic additives, revealed that ditungsten carbide (W 2 C), cobalt <b>tungsten</b> <b>boride</b> (CoWB), ditungsten boride (W 2 B) and dicobalt boride (Co 2 B) are formed when heated between 800 ºC and 1100 ºC, thus indicating that c-BN reacts with the hard compounds. On the other hand, the study carried out on batch C, initially containing c-BN, titanium nitride (TiN), titanium carbide (TiC), Al, another unidentified compound, and organic additives, showed the formation of new compounds at temperatures between 800 ºC and 1100 ºC. Such compounds are: aluminium nitride (AlN) and titanium boride (TiB 2). Moreover, some unidentified compounds present in the raw powder react at high temperatures and therefore no traces of them are found at 1100 ºC. The study also showed that burnout and pyrolysis of the organic binders present in both batches occur between 250 ºC and 450 ºC. Thus, carbonaceous materials are left in the sample and they further react with the other compounds. Further investigation is needed in order to confirm the reactions suggested in the current project. Validerat; 20110713 (anonymous...|$|E
