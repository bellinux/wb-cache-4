2500|$|Sean O'Connor, former EastEnders series story {{producer}} and then-editor on radio soap opera The Archers, was announced {{to be taking}} over the role. Treadwell-Collins left on 6 May and O'Connor's first credited episode was broadcast on 11 July Although O'Connor's first credited episode aired in July, his own creative work was not seen onscreen until late September. Additionally, Oliver Kent was brought in as the Head of Continuing Drama Series for BBC Scripted Studios, meaning that Kent would oversee EastEnders along with O'Connor. O'Connor's approach to the show {{was to have a}} firmer focus on realism, which he said was being [...] "true to EastEnders DNA and [...] a way of capturing {{what it would be like}} if Julia Smith and Tony Holland were making the show now." [...] He said that [...] "EastEnders has always had a distinctly different tone from the other soaps but over time we've diluted our unique selling point. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ourselves and go back to the origins of the show and what made it successful in the first place. It should be entertaining but it should also be informative—that's part of our unique BBC compact with the audience. It shouldn't just be a distraction from your own life, it should be an exploration of the life shared by the audience and the characters." [...] O'Connor planned to stay with EastEnders until the end of 2017, but announced his departure on 23 June 2017 with immediate effect, saying he wanted to concentrate on a career in film. John Yorke returned as a temporary creative director. Kent said, [...] "John Yorke is a Walford legend and I am thrilled that he will be joining us for a short period to oversee the show and to help us build on Sean's legacy while we recruit a long-term successor." ...|$|E

40|$|I want to preface {{this article}} {{by saying that}} I have {{personally}} tried to implement {{what we are going}} to study, but I feel that I have only begun, because I think it is a subject that takes the Christian all his or her life to come to grips with. But in saying that I also want to make another point. The subject of the call to Christian meditation in the Bible is something that I have become increasingly impassioned about, and especially for the development of Christian leadership. I think part of the reason we have a crisis in Christian leadership is because we are not training leaders in the old biblical art of meditation. I hope by the end of our study you, too, will see the truth of that. Introduction: Prejudices Against the Practice of Meditation I want to begin with a word of honesty. I think most of us have some very negative prejudices against the subject of meditation. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> honest about that.

40|$|Indices {{of child}} {{well-being}} are needed {{because it is}} too easy for us to focus on narrow aspects of well-being and {{lose sight of the}} whole child. Ideally, summary indices like the CWI give us the means to evaluate each need, strength, advance, and inequality that we observe in particular domains in the larger context of the whole child. And they compel us to evaluate how our children are doing overall rather than narrowly defining success as higher math scores or lower obesity rates. It is too easy, in fact, to purchase success in one domain with decline in another as we direct limited temporal and financial resources towards the concern du jour. To describe the condition of children as a whole, a summary index must reflect all major domains of well-being with indicators that adequately reflect each domain. When significant components are left out or poorly operationalized, the index is incomplete or inaccurate, and trends and group comparisons based on it will often be misleading. This can lead to poor decisions and poor policy, so the stakes are not small. It is useful to see child well-being through the lens of history. The CWI was constructed with this in mind. While one may quibble with its content here and there, I am comfortable that it represents about the best one can do with the class of data elements that have been regularly collected since the mid- 1970 s. In planning for the future, however, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> looking at developing a limited set of complementary indices that take full advantage of the richer set of contemporary data sources available to us. I also suggest that future index work be based on frameworks that have grown directly out of child and youth development research rather than th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Aging - {{a journey}} thru time and space. To {{be a human}} being is to age. Time is the the {{dimension}} that makes us experience aging. We count the time with instruments that we attach to our bodies and in the space that we inhibit. We all {{have to live with}} the reality of death. We make strategies for how to postpone it. To be healthy and young is what we all want. That is what media tells us. To get old is something we try to avoid. We want to be young all our life. Old people are marginalized in our society. The stigma about the elderly is profound. We have to work against the ageism and look at eachother as individual human beings, not as representations of a cetrain age. Aging is the base of my research, the physical and psychological transformations that are happening over a lifetime. The cells in our bodies are set on a clock, they can not get reproduced forever. Time is the foundation of our history and our future. Time is what makes us old and young. In modern society we have organised the human beings in different age categories. You share the history events with your cohorts, but that doesn ́t say anything about you as a person or that you are alike. I think that is a big misstake. In our dreams we can be any age and any place. Sleep makes up a third of our life and it is the only time spent unaware of time. I wish that age was something we didn ́t use as a discriminating tool but unfortunately it is and also the most common one. I want to give a medal to those who doesn ́t give in to ageism. I have created a series of jewelry and corpus that I hope will inbody some questions about aging and ageism that I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware of. ...|$|E
