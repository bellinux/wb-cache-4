25|$|The {{evolution}} of the industrial melanism mutation {{has been shown to}} be due to the insertion of a <b>transposable</b> <b>element</b> into the first intron of the cortex gene, resulting in an increase in the abundance of the cortex transcript, which is expressed in developing wings, though the exact mechanism how this results in melanization is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Insertions add {{one or more}} extra {{nucleotides}} {{into the}} DNA. They are usually caused by transposable elements, or errors during replication of repeating elements. Insertions in the coding region of a gene may alter splicing of the mRNA (splice site mutation), or cause {{a shift in the}} reading frame (frameshift), both of which can significantly alter the gene product. Insertions can be reversed by excision of the <b>transposable</b> <b>element.</b>|$|E
25|$|Transposon {{silencing}} {{is a form}} of transcriptional {{gene silencing}} targeting transposons. Transcriptional gene silencing is a product of histone modifications that prevent the transcription of a particular area of DNA. Transcriptional silencing of transposons is crucial to the maintenance of a genome. The “jumping” of transposons generates genomic instability and can cause extremely deleterious mutations. <b>Transposable</b> <b>element</b> insertions have been linked to many diseases including hemophilia, severe combined immunodeficiency, and predisposition to cancer. The silencing of transposons is therefore extremely critical in the germline in order to stop transposon mutations from developing and being passed on to the next generation. Additionally, these epigenetic defenses against transposons can be heritable. Studies in Drosophila, Arabidopsis thaliana, and mice all indicate that small interfering RNAs are responsible for transposon silencing. In animals, these siRNAS and piRNAs are most active in the gonads.|$|E
40|$|<b>Transposable</b> <b>elements</b> are {{powerful}} drivers of genome evolution in many eukaryotes. Although they are mostly considered as 'selfish' genetic elements, increasing {{evidence suggests that}} they contribute to genetic variability; particularly under stress conditions. Over the past few years, the role of <b>transposable</b> <b>elements</b> during host-microbe interactions has been recognised. It has been proposed that many pathogenic microbes have evolved a 'two-speed' genome with regions that show increased variability and that are enriched in <b>transposable</b> <b>elements</b> and pathogenicity-related genes. Plants similarly display structured genomes with transposable-element-rich regions that mediate accelerated evolution. Immune receptor genes typically reside in such regions. Various mechanisms have recently been identified through which <b>transposable</b> <b>elements</b> contribute to the coevolution between plants and their associated microbes. <b>Transposable</b> <b>elements</b> {{are powerful}} drivers of adaptive genome evolution in plants and in symbiotic microbes, and contribute to their coevolution. Analysis of large next-generation sequencing datasets fuels {{a better understanding of}} the precise role of <b>transposable</b> <b>elements</b> in genome evolution, revealing active as well as passive contributions. <b>Transposable</b> <b>elements</b> contribute to genome evolution through diverse mechanisms, by mediating structural variations, gene inactivation, gene copy variation, but also by affecting gene expression. Further mechanistic understanding of the role of <b>transposable</b> <b>elements</b> in genome evolution will come from detailed structural analysis of chromatin...|$|R

50|$|Gene {{members of}} a multigene family or multigene {{families}} within superfamilies exist on different chromosomes due to relocation of those genes after duplication of the ancestral gene. <b>Transposable</b> <b>elements</b> {{play a role in}} the movement of genes. <b>Transposable</b> <b>elements</b> are recognized by inverted repeats at their 5' and 3' ends. When two <b>transposable</b> <b>elements</b> are close enough in the same region on a chromosome, they can form a composite transposon. The protein transposase recognizes the outermost inverted repeats, cutting the DNA segment. Any genes between the two <b>transposable</b> <b>elements</b> are relocated as the composite transposon jumps to a new area of the genome.|$|R

The Center for Biological Diversity gives an annual 'Rubber Dodo Award', to [...] "those who have done the most to destroy wild places, species and biological diversity". In 2011, the nephiline spider Nephilengys dodo, which inhabits the same woods as the dodo once did, was named after the bird {{to raise awareness of}} the urgent need for protection of the Mauritius biota. Two species of ant from Mauritius have been named after the dodo: Pseudolasius dodo in 1946 and Pheidole dodo in 2013. A species of isopod from a coral reef off Réunion was named Hansenium dodo in 1991. The name dodo has been used by scientists naming genetic elements, honoring the dodo's flightless nature. A fruitfly gene within a region of a chromosome required for flying ability was named [...] "dodo". In addition, a defective <b>transposable</b> <b>element</b> family from Phytophthora infestans was named DodoPi as it contained mutations that eliminated the element's ability to jump to new locations in a chromosome.|$|E

While the horizontal transfer of <b>transposable</b> <b>elements</b> is well documented in animals, only two cases have been described in plants despite the abundance of these elements in plant genomes.

2500|$|It is now {{generally}} {{assumed that}} the Psittaciformes, or their common ancestors with several related bird orders, were present {{somewhere in the world}} around the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event (K-Pg extinction), some 66Mya. If so, they probably had not evolved their morphological autapomorphies yet, but were generalised arboreal birds. The combined evidence supported the hypothesis of Psittaciformes being [...] "near passerines", i. e., the mostly terrestrial birds that emerged in close proximity to the K-Pg extinction. Analysis of <b>transposable</b> <b>element</b> insertions observed in the genomes of passerines and parrots, but not in the genomes of other birds, provides strong evidence that parrots are the sister group of passerines, forming a clade Psittacopasserae, to the exclusion of the next closest group, the falcons.|$|E

Furthermore, Bellen and colleagues devised a new transformation technology that permits site-specific integration of very large DNA fragments, which led to the generation of a collection of flies carrying molecularly defined duplications for more than 90% of the Drosophila X-chromosome. Hundreds of Drosophila researchers utilize this collection. Most recently his lab created a new <b>transposable</b> <b>element</b> (MiMIC) that permits even more downstream manipulations via RMCE (recombinase-mediated cassette exchange), such as protein tagging and knockdown [...] and large scale homologous recombination.

40|$|Comparative {{genomics}} {{has revealed}} that major vertebrate lineages contain quantitatively and qualitatively different populations of retrotransposable elements and DNA transposons, with important differences also frequently observed between species of the same lineage. This is essentially due to (i) the differential evolution of ancestral families of <b>transposable</b> <b>elements,</b> with evolutionary scenarios ranging from complete extinction to massive invasion; (ii) the lineage-specific introduction of <b>transposable</b> <b>elements</b> by infection and horizontal transfer, as exemplified by endogenous retroviruses; and (iii) the lineage-specific emergence of new <b>transposable</b> <b>elements,</b> as particularly observed for non-coding retroelements called short interspersed elements (SINEs). During vertebrate evolution, <b>transposable</b> <b>elements</b> have repeatedly contributed regulatory and coding sequences to the host, leading {{to the emergence of}} new lineage-specific gene regulations and functions. In all vertebrate lineages, there is evidence of transposable element-mediated genomic rearrangements such as insertions, deletions, inversions and duplications potentially associated with or subsequent to speciation events. Taken together, these observations indicate that <b>transposable</b> <b>elements</b> are major drivers of genomic and biological diversity in vertebrates, with possible important roles in speciation and major evolutionary transitions.

40|$|Abstract. Nonrandom {{distributions}} of <b>transposable</b> <b>elements</b> {{can be generated}} {{by a variety of}} genomic features. Using the full D. melanogaster genome as a model, we characterize the orientations of different classes of <b>transposable</b> <b>elements</b> in relation to the directionality of genes. DNA-mediated <b>transposable</b> <b>elements</b> {{are more likely to be}} in the same orientation as neighboring genes when they occur in the non-transcribed regions that flank genes. However, RNA-mediated <b>transposable</b> <b>elements</b> located in an intron are more often oriented in the direction opposite to that of the host gene. These orientation biases are strongest for genes with highly biased codon usage, probably reflecting the ability of such loci to respond to weak positive or negative selection. The leading hypothesis for selection against <b>transposable</b> <b>elements</b> in the coding orientation proposes that transcription termination poly(A) signal motifs within retroele-ments interfere with normal gene transcription. However, after accounting for differences in base composition between the strands, we find no evidence for global selection against spurious transcription termination signals in introns. We therefore conclude that premature termination of host gene transcription due to the presence of poly(A) signal motifs in ret-roelements might only partially explain strand-specific detrimental effects in the D. melanogaster genome...|$|R
