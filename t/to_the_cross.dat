5|$|I-87 {{begins in}} the Bronx at the {{northern}} approach to the Triborough Bridge, where it connects to the Bruckner Expressway (I-278) at a directional T interchange. The route heads west from the interchange, paralleling loosely with the Harlem River through Mott Haven. After , the highway makes a turn to the north, mirroring {{a change in the}} nearby river's course. It passes by Yankee Stadium on its way to Highbridge, where the Deegan connects <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cross</b> Bronx Expressway (I-95 and U.S. Route1 or US1) at the eastern approach to the Alexander Hamilton Bridge. The Deegan remains in close proximity to the Harlem River until the waterway turns westward at Kingsbridge to form the northern edge of Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, county {{officials}} admitted {{that it was}} likely that the $7million appropriated would not be enough, and instead {{it would be better}} spent on improving other nearby parkways. The proposed parkway would have needed $400,000 more for additional right-of-way, and the construction costs would leave no money to repave the Bronx River Parkway, the link <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cross</b> County Parkway, and to extend the Saw Mill River Parkway. The county would have had to spend $8million of its own money as well. The parkway was instead shortened from Bronxville to Elmsford.|$|E

5|$|In the past, the standard-bearer of the Mrkojevići clan, a Muslim, walked next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> with a flag in {{his left}} and a knife in his right hand, ready to use it if anyone {{attempted}} to take the cross. The clan especially feared that the participants from Krajina might try to recover the sacred object. At the end of 19th century the number of Muslims in the procession dropped as their religious and political leaders disapproved of their participation in it. After World War II, Yugoslavia's socialist government discouraged public religious celebrations, and the procession was not held between 1959 and 1984.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Clearview was {{intended}} to run along the existing right-of-ways of Utopia Parkway and Francis Lewis Boulevard. An alternate proposed routing would have run along Little Neck Bay and through Alley Pond Park, essentially parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cross</b> Island Parkway. By September 1956, the Clearview was mapped along 206th and 207th Streets and Hollis Court Boulevard, east of Francis Lewis Boulevard, after community opposition. The reroute {{reduced the number of}} properties to be demolished or relocated from 860 to 421. An information center was set up by the TBTA for local residents displaced by the expressway.|$|E

5|$|At the New York City–Yonkers border, I-87 {{changes to}} the New York State Thruway as the {{mainline}} proceeds northward through Yonkers and southern Westchester County. It connects with Central Park Avenue (NY100) at exit1, the first of 12 exits within the county. The first few exits serve various local streets, with exit2 providing access to Yonkers Raceway and exit3 serving the Cross County Shopping Center. At exit4, I-87 connects <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cross</b> County Parkway, an east–west parkway providing access to the Saw Mill River, Bronx River, and Hutchinson River parkways. The north-south parkways and I-95 run parallel to the Thruway through Southern Westchester. The Bronx River parkway leaves to the northeast midway through Yonkers, while the Saw Mill and Sprain Brook parkways follow the Thruway out of the city.|$|E
5|$|Jesus sits in {{judgement}} in {{the upper}} centre panel. He holds a lily {{in his right hand}} and a sword in his left, and sits on a rainbow extending across two panels, while his feet rest on a sphere. His right hand is raised in the act of blessing, his left hand lowered. These positions indicate the act of judgement; he is deciding if souls are to be sent to Heaven or Hell, his gestures echoing the direction and positioning of the scales held by the Archangel Michael beneath him. His palms are open, revealing the wounds sustained when they were nailed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cross,</b> while his cope gapes in places making visible the injury caused by the lance, which pours deep-red blood. Christ's face is identical to the representation in van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, completed just a few years later in 1452. Christ, placed so high in the pictorial space and spanning both registers, orchestrates the entirety of the inner panels. Whereas earlier Last Judgements might have seemed chaotic, here Christ brings a sense of order.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Light Horse Brigade {{continued}} their advance to Es Salt up the Wadi Jeria and Wadi Sir, reaching Ain es Sir at 10:30, with forward patrols <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> roads and north {{east of the}} village. During this advance the brigade was fired on by two Ottoman 77mm guns located near Sueifiye. These guns fired 16 shells, then withdrew as the light horse patrols approached. The brigade bivouacked for the night on the road from Ain es Sir to Ain Hummar when a strong picquet line was maintained throughout the night. (See Falls Sketch Map 24 Amman detail) Most of the land {{to the west of}} Amman was cleared of enemy forces during the afternoon of 24 September, and by that evening Chaytor's Force, less the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, the 38th Royal Fusiliers at Shunet Nimrin and the Jisr ed Damieh detachment, was concentrated at Es Salt with mounted troops at Suweileh.|$|E

5|$|The York City War Memorial is a First World War {{memorial}} {{designed by}} Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York {{in the north}} of England. Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial. Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose. Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument. The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York. Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials. Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's. Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location. This was scaled back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> alone due to lack of funds.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{captures the}} instant of Christ's death, {{traditionally}} the moment after {{the breaking of}} the thieves' legs (although this is not depicted). Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his pubic hair visible. His hands and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his feet <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> stains its wooden base. His arms strain under the weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death. In the mid-ground, {{at the base of the}} cross, Longinus, on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant, stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a lance, as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured Stephaton holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.|$|E
25|$|The LCMS {{holds that}} the Old Testament and the New Testament both contain both Law and Gospel. The Old Testament, therefore, is {{valuable}} to Christians. Its teachings point forward in time <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cross</b> of Christ {{in the same way}} that the New Testament points backward in time <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cross.</b> This Lutheran doctrine was summarized by C.
