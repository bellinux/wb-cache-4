5|$|The {{building}} is formed by a composite steel and concrete frame, with various setbacks in its profile, meaning {{the upper floors}} are much smaller in area than lower levels. Outrigger trusses {{at the top of}} the building and at the various setbacks help <b>to</b> <b>stiffen</b> the building's reinforced concrete core against the strong winds prevalent in the area.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second quarter, the Hokies' defense began <b>to</b> <b>stiffen.</b> Aided by a 10-yard holding penalty against the Eagles, Matt Ryan was forced to complete a 14-yard pass on 4th-and-9 to earn a first down and keep the drive alive. Three incomplete passes followed, however, and the Eagles again settled for a field goal attempt. This time, the 37-yard kick sailed through the uprights, giving Boston College a 100 lead with 11:20 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomy of}} pterosaurs was highly {{modified}} from their reptilian ancestors by the adaption to flight. Pterosaur bones were hollow and air-filled, like {{the bones of}} birds. They had a keeled breastbone that was developed for the attachment of flight muscles and an enlarged brain that shows specialised features associated with flight. In some later pterosaurs, the backbone over the shoulders fused into a structure known as a notarium, which served <b>to</b> <b>stiffen</b> the torso during flight, and provide a stable support for the scapula (shoulder blade).|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the earlier}} UN defeat at the Battle of Unsan, the US 25th Infantry Division {{expected}} to encounter heavy Chinese resistance during its advance. But the Chinese screening forces withdrew with the American advance. Aside from the harassing fire, the US 25th Infantry Division did not encounter strong resistance along the way. Ipsok was captured by Task Force Dolvin on November 24, and several American POWs from the Unsan battle were also recovered at the town. When Task Force Dolvin proceeded to capture a series of hills north of Ipsok on the next day, Chinese resistance started <b>to</b> <b>stiffen.</b> During the hill battles {{on the afternoon of}} November 25, the Eighth Army Ranger Company of Task Force Dolvin suffered heavy losses against the Chinese defenses, and the task force stopped its advance at dusk.|$|E

40|$|Even after {{successful}} {{treatment of}} aortic coarctation, {{a high risk}} of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remains. Uncertainty exists on the factors contributing to this increased risk among which are the presence of (1) a residual narrowing leading to an additional resistance and (2) a less distensible zone disturbing the buffer function of the aorta. As the many interfering factors and adaptive physiological mechanisms present in vivo prohibit the study of the isolated impact of these individual factors, a numerical fluid-structure interaction model is developed to predict central hemodynamics in coarctation treatment. The overall impact of a stiffening on the hemodynamics is limited, with a small increase in systolic pressure (up to 8 mmHg) proximal <b>to</b> the <b>stiffening</b> which is amplified with increasing stiffening and length. A residual narrowing, on the other hand, affects the hemodynamics significantly. For a short segment (10 mm), the combination of a stiffening and narrowing (coarctation index 0. 5) causes an increase in systolic pressure of 58 mmHg, with 31 mmHg due to narrowing and an additional 27 mmHg due <b>to</b> <b>stiffening.</b> For a longer segment (25 mm), an increase in systolic pressure of 50 mmHg is found, of which only 9 mmHg is due <b>to</b> <b>stiffening...</b>|$|R

50|$|Historically, hoods {{were either}} similar to modern hoods, or a {{separate}} form of headgear.

25|$|The {{presence}} of the plaque induces the muscle cells of the blood vessel to stretch, compensating for the additional bulk, and the endothelial lining thickens, increasing the separation between the plaque and lumen.

25|$|The hastati (sing. hastatus) {{consisted}} of raw or inexperienced soldiers, {{considered to be}} less reliable than legionaries of several years' service. The Hastati were placed at the front for several reasons. One reason is the city of Rome could ill-afford to lose experienced soldiers, so they put the greenest soldiers at the front. If they survived, the Hastati/tus would gain invaluable experience. Another reason is if the newest soldiers succumbed to battle nerves and broke and tried to run, then there were experienced soldiers behind them <b>to</b> <b>stiffen</b> their resolve.|$|E

Introduction of nematic ordering leads <b>to</b> <b>stiffening</b> of the membrane. Nematic ordering can also result in anisotropic rigidity on the surface leading to formation of membrane tubes.

40|$|Abstract — The ability <b>to</b> {{selectively}} <b>stiffen</b> otherwise com-pliant soft actuators {{increases their}} versatility and dexterity. We investigate granular jamming and layer jamming as two possible methods <b>to</b> achieve <b>stiffening</b> with PneuFlex actuators, {{a type of}} soft continuum actuator. The paper details five designs of jamming compartments that can be attached to an actuator. We evaluate the stiffening of the five different prototypes, achieving an up to 8 -fold increase in stiffness. The strength {{of the most effective}} prototype based on layer jamming is also validated in the context of pushing buttons, resulting in an 2. 23 -fold increase in pushing force. I...|$|R
25|$|Trimble {{continued}} advancing up {{the ravine}} on the Confederate right, outflanking successive Union positions. In the meantime, Milroy advanced on Stahel's right, supported by artillery.

Bohlen advanced on the far Union left <b>to</b> <b>stiffen</b> Stahel's crumbling defense. Milroy's left flank was endangered by Stahel's retreat, and Frémont ordered him to withdraw. Jackson brought Taylor's brigade forward to support Ewell if needed, but Taylor remained in reserve on the Port Republic Road near the Dunker Church.|$|E
