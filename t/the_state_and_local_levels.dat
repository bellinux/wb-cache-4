Stone helped initiate the first National Women's Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts and she supported and sustained it annually, along with a number of other local, state and regional activist conventions. Stone spoke in front of a number of legislative bodies to promote laws giving more rights to women. She assisted in establishing the Woman's National Loyal League to help pass the Thirteenth Amendment and thereby abolish slavery, after which she helped form the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), which built support for a woman suffrage Constitutional amendment by winning woman suffrage at <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|E

25|$|Despite {{favorable}} laws, promising institutional arrangements, {{and external}} funding, {{the government has}} not, on the whole, been effective in controlling damage to the environment. This failure is only in small measure because of the opposition of anti-environmental groups. In greater part, it {{can be attributed to}} the traditional separation between official rhetoric and actual practice in Brazil. It is also related to general problems of governance, fiscal crisis, and lingering doubts about appropriate tradeoffs between the environment and development. Some of the most effective governmental action in the environmental area has occurred at <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>levels</b> in the most developed states and has involved NGOs. In 1994 the PNMA began to stress decentralization and strengthening of state environmental agencies, a tendency that subsequently gained momentum.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, {{a number}} of AFSCME local unions, {{composed}} primarily of caseworkers, disaffiliated from that union and joined the CIO. The CIO allowed these local unions to form the State, County, and Municipal Workers of America (SCMWA), and charged the new organization with competing with AFSCME at <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>levels</b> for membership. Most of the leaders {{and many of the}} members of these local unions were strongly sympathetic to the beliefs and goals of the Communist Party USA. Former AFSCME executive board member Abram Flaxer was appointed the new union's president, and former AFSCME Secretary-Treasurer David Kanes held the same post in SCMWA. SCMWA membership grew quickly: It more than doubled the number of local unions (from 12 to 28) in a year, and its members rose from 25,000 in 1937 to more than 48,000 in 1946. In comparison, AFSCME's membership grew from 13,259 in 1947 to more than 73,000 in 1946.|$|E

These projects opened to these youth, training opportunities and enabled the majority of them to qualify for jobs heretofore closed to them." [...] Within the administration, Bethune advocated for the appointment of black NYA officials to positions of political power. Bethune’s administrative assistants served as liaisons between the National Division of Negro Affairs and the NYA agencies on <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>levels.</b> The high number of administrative assistants composed a work force commanded by Bethune. They helped gain better job and salary opportunities for blacks across the country. During her tenure, Bethune also pushed federal officials to approve a program of consumer education for blacks, and a foundation for black crippled children. She planned for studies for black workers’ education councils. National officials did not support these due to inadequate funding and fear of duplicating the work of private non-governmental agencies. The NYA was terminated in 1943.|$|E
500|$|The {{national}} {{leadership of the}} former Jana Sangh consciously renounced its identity, and attempted to integrate with the political culture of the Janata Party, based on Gandhian and Hindu traditionalist principles. According to Christophe Jaffrelot, this {{proved to be an}} impossible assimilation. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>levels</b> of the Jana Sangh remained relatively unchanged, retaining a strong association with the RSS, which did not sit well with the moderate centre-right constituents of the Party. Violence between Hindus and Muslims increased sharply during the years that the Janata Party formed the government, with former Jana Sangha members being implicated in the riots at Aligarh and Jamshedpur in 1978–79. The other major constituents of the Janata Party demanded that the Jana Sangh should break from the RSS, which the Jana Sangh refused to do. Eventually, a fragment of the Janata Party broke off to form the Janata Party (Secular). The Morarji Desai government was reduced to a minority in the Parliament, forcing its resignation. Following a brief period of coalition rule, general elections were held in 1980, in which the Janata Party fared poorly, winning only 31 seats. In April 1980, shortly after the elections, the National Executive Council of the Janata Party banned its members from being 'dual members' of party and the RSS. In response, the former Jana Sangh members left [...] to create a new political party, known as the Bharatiya Janata Party.|$|E

40|$|This thesis studies {{about the}} {{patterns}} of debt accumulation of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> governments in <b>the</b> United <b>States,</b> particularly by focusing on how intergovernmental fiscal relations, fiscal institutions, capital market, and electoral mechanisms might potentially influence {{the patterns of}} debt accumulation of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> governments. I develop empirical models to show that both fiscal institutions and intergovernmental fiscal relations have significant impacts on the patterns of debt accumulation of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> governments. I also discuss that political accountability and well-functioning capital market are important in stabilizing the patterns of debt management of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> governments. From <b>the</b> empirical analysis of the patterns of the debt accumulation of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> governments, I claim that US fiscal management is unique particularly in {{that there are a}} variety of patterns on how <b>the</b> <b>state</b> governments regulate <b>the</b> fiscal management of themselves and that of their subnational governments. From the empirical results, I suggest a possibility that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> governments sometimes supplement the lack of capacity of local governments in borrowing when some local governments face severer resource constraints in their fiscal decisions as well as are faced with the limitations on borrowing capacities. That is how I claim that the flexibility in the intergovernmental fiscal relationships is one of the advantages of the decentralized fiscal management in <b>the</b> United <b>States.</b> by Hiroshi Shibata.
