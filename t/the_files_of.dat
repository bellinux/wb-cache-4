5|$|In 2006 Wałęsa quit Solidarity {{in protest}} of the union's support of the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, and Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński—twin {{brothers}} who had been prominent in Solidarity and were now serving as the country’s president and prime minister, respectively. The main point of disagreement was the Kaczyńskis’ focus on rooting out {{those who had been}} involved in communist rule and their party's attempt to make public all <b>the</b> <b>files</b> <b>of</b> the former communist secret police. Until then only members of the government and parliament had to declare any connection with the former security services. Wałęsa and his supporters argued the so-called transparency legislation advocated by the government might turn into a witch hunt and the more than 500,000 Poles who had possibly collaborated with the communist secret police could face exposure.|$|E
5|$|Little of {{this was}} true, {{but at the time}} the British {{had no way of knowing}} this. <b>The</b> <b>files</b> <b>of</b> the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether he really had any intention of going to the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab files that he had been asked to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.|$|E

5|$|The Public Records Act 1958 {{required}} {{all government}} departments {{to set up}} archives and records management systems. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) was nominally exempt from the act, being a government corporation rather than a department, but voluntarily asked to be included under the Act. This created a position at the UKAEA for an historian and archivist. Gowing applied for and secured the job in 1959. This involved organising systems and criteria for the selection for preservation of scientific, engineering and administrative records, and writing {{the history of the}} British atomic project since it had begun in 1939, the UKAEA having inherited <b>the</b> <b>files</b> <b>of</b> predecessor organisations including the Tube Alloys Directorate.|$|E
5|$|Other offices {{included}} the sworn clerks, the examiners, the clerk to the barons, and the clerk to the King's Remembrancer. There were eight sworn clerks, so called {{because they were}} sworn officers of the court, who held their offices for life and worked under the Remembrancer. Each clerk acted as {{an attorney for the}} parties in court, and every party was required to employ one. The first clerk was known as the First Secondary, and administered oaths out of the Red Book of the Exchequer. The sworn clerks were assisted by 24side clerks, of whom each sworn clerk appointed three. Each side clerk studied under a sworn clerk for five years before practising himself, although under the sworn clerk's name. A side clerk had the chance of being promoted to sworn clerk, first by the Remembrancer and then by the sworn clerks themselves. The examiners were tasked with supervising depositions of witnesses, bringing the witness to a Baron, administering the oath and keeping <b>the</b> <b>files</b> <b>of</b> the depositions. In 1624 it was decided these examiners should be sworn officers of the court, and from then on each Baron had an examiner, who acted in the Baron's name. The office of examiner was dissolved in 1841, when the equity jurisdiction of the Exchequer came to an end. In addition to an examiner, each Baron had at least one clerk, who acted as their private secretary; although not paid, they were authorised to take fees for their work. The Chief Baron had two clerks, while the puisne Barons had one each. The King's Remembrancer also employed a clerk, who was also a secretary. He received no salary and was not a sworn officer of the court, meaning the Remembrancer could have him replaced at any time.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Cortana is not {{explained}} in the video games, but in the Halo novels. Her first chronological appearance in the story is in , a 2001 prequel to the first Halo game. Dr. Halsey allows Cortana to choose which SPARTAN-II soldier to accompany on an upcoming mission; Cortana picks the Master Chief, whom she believes is her best match. Cortana makes a reference to this event via voiceover in Halo 3 during a cinematic before gameplay begins. Cortana and the Spartans are assigned a near-suicidal mission: to take the cruiser Pillar of Autumn to the home world of the Covenant, an alliance of alien races, and capture one of their Prophets to force a truce. Cortana's role is {{to act as a}} mission specialist, hacking the Covenant systems and piloting the captured Covenant ship. Before the mission, Cortana helps the Master Chief to survive the near-lethal exercises designed to test the Chief's MJOLNIR battle armor. Afterward, she plants incriminating evidence in <b>the</b> <b>files</b> <b>of</b> Colonel Ackerson, the ONI operative who nearly killed both of them, as revenge. When the Covenant attacks the planet Reach, one of the largest planetary military bases besides Earth, Cortana guides the Pillar of Autumn based on star charts on a Forerunner tablet, thus bringing them to Halo. During , Cortana serves the same role she did in Halo: Combat Evolved, but her role is expanded such as showing her saving the Master Chief's life from a Flood Infection Form at one point.|$|E

25|$|When {{the user}} encrypts files {{after the first}} stage of such an attack, the FEKs are {{automatically}} encrypted with the designated DRA's public key. The attacker only needs to access the computer once more as Administrator to gain full access to all those subsequently EFS-encrypted files. Even using Syskey mode 2 or 3 does not protect against this attack, because the attacker could back up the encrypted files offline, restore them elsewhere and use the DRA's private key to decrypt <b>the</b> <b>files.</b> <b>Of</b> course, if such a malicious insider can gain physical access to the computer, you might consider all security features to be irrelevant, because they could also install rootkits, software or even hardware keyloggers etc. on the computer – which is potentially much more interesting and effective than overwriting DRA policy.|$|E

Moreover, Harte attributes an ulterior motive to the SACA's recruitment of Bradman. The issue of the off-field behaviour of Vic Richardson, and some other regular SA players, had festered {{over a number of years}} and the SACA was desperate for a solution. Therefore, they wanted Bradman to provide new leadership and improve discipline, as well as score runs. Bradman became a committeeman of the SACA, and a selector of the SA and Australian teams. He took his adopted state to the Sheffield Shield for the first time in ten years and set a string of SA records along the way.|$|E
