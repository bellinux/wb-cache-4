500|$|We {{are also}} of opinion {{that as the}} right of the {{plaintiff}} to sue was given by, and is dependent upon, the statute, the statute of limitations is a bar to the action. By the act of 1845, the actions thereby authorized are to be brought and maintained ‘in the same time’ as if brought by citizens of the state. The question is not whether an Indian title can be barred by adverse possession, or by state statutes of limitation. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plaintiff cannot invoke the special remedy given by the statute, without being bound by the conditions upon which it is given.|$|E
500|$|Responding to this {{emphasis}} on pleasure, Albert Guerard, Jr. argues that the poem contains a [...] "longing not for art but a free reverie of any kind. The form of the poem is that of progression by association, so that the movement of feeling is {{at the mercy of}} words evoked by chance, such words as fade and forlorn, the very words that, like a bell, toll the dreamer back to his sole self." [...] However, Fogle points out that the terms Guerard emphasizes are [...] "associational translations" [...] and that Guerard misunderstands Keats's aesthetic. After all, the acceptance of the loss of pleasure {{by the end of the}} poem is an acceptance of life and, in turn, of death. Death was a constant theme that permeated aspects of Keats poetry because he was exposed to death of his family members throughout his life. Within the poem, there are many images of death. The nightingale experiences a sort of death and even the god Apollo experiences death, but his death reveals his own divine state. As Perkins explains, [...] "But, of course, the nightingale is not thought to be literally dying. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deity or the nightingale can sing without dying. But, as the ode makes clear, man cannot—or at least not in a visionary way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps more clearly, {{the method}} can be {{explained}} in terms of Boolean-valued models. In these, any statement is assigned a truth value from some complete atomless Boolean algebra, rather than just a true/false value. Then an ultrafilter is picked in this Boolean algebra, which assigns values true/false to statements of our theory. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resulting theory has a model which contains this ultrafilter, which can be understood as a new model obtained by extending the old one with this ultrafilter. By picking a Boolean-valued model in an appropriate way, we can get a model that has the desired property. In it, only statements which must be true (are [...] "forced" [...] to be true) will be true, in a sense (since it has this extension/minimality property).|$|E
2500|$|Wittgenstein {{develops}} {{this discussion}} of games into the key {{notion of a}} language-game. Wittgenstein introduces the term using simple examples, but intends it {{to be used for}} the many ways in which we use language. The central component of language games is that they are uses of language, and language is used in multifarious ways. For example, in one language-game, a word might be used to stand for (or refer to) an object, but in another the same word might be used for giving orders, or for asking questions, and so on. The famous example is {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "game". We speak of various kinds of games: board games, betting games, sports, [...] "war games". These are all different uses of the word [...] "games". Wittgenstein also gives the example of [...] "Water!", which can be used as an exclamation, an order, a request, or as an answer to a question. The meaning of the word depends on the language-game within which it is being used. Another way Wittgenstein puts <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> word [...] "water" [...] has no meaning apart from its use within a language-game. One might use the word as an order to have someone else bring you a glass of water. But it can also be used to warn someone that the water has been poisoned. One might even use the word as code by members of a secret society.|$|E

30|$|It {{goes without}} saying that all PD should attend to both {{mathematical}} and pedagogical considerations. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if different groups enter into PD with somewhat different orientations to both content and pedagogy, then PD should be responsive to those differences.|$|R

60|$|The {{interesting}} point is that, while the Scottish ballads give either the English version of Percy's death (in Minstrelsy, 1806) or another account mentioned by Hume of Godscroft (circ. 1610), {{that he was}} slain {{by one of his}} own men, the Scottish versions are ALL deeply affected in an important point by Froissart's contemporary narrative, which has not affected the English versions. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> death of Douglas was by his order concealed from both parties.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{charm of}} John Barleycorn {{was still a}} mystery to me. I was so {{organically}} a non-alcoholic that alcohol itself made no appeal; the chemical reactions it produced in me were not satisfying because I possessed no need for such chemical satisfaction. I drank because the men I was with drank, and because my nature was such that I could not permit myself to be less of a man than other men at their favourite pastime. And I still had a sweet tooth, and on privy occasions {{when there was no}} man to see, bought candy and blissfully devoured it.|$|E
6000|$|I {{remember}} a Battersea {{little girl who}} wheeled her large baby sister stuffed into a doll's perambulator. When questioned on this course of conduct, she replied: [...] "I haven't got a dolly, and Baby is pretending to be my dolly." [...] Nature was indeed imitating art. First a doll had been a substitute for a child; afterwards a child was a mere substitute for a doll. But that opens other matters; the point is here that such devotion takes {{up most of the}} brain and most of the life; much as if it were really the thing which it is supposed to symbolize. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> man writing on motherhood is merely an educationalist; the child playing with a doll is a mother.|$|E

Thus Dr. Munro mentions the case of a man who, while digging a drain in his garden in Scotland, found an adze of jade and a pre-historic urn. Dr. Munro declares, with another expert, that the jade adze is [...] "a modern Australian implement," [...] which is the more amazing as I am not aware that the Australians possess any jade. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> modern Australian adze was not, as falsely reported, in the pre- historic urn. {14b} ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{trouble with}} most sociologists, criminologists, etc., {{is that while}} their {{knowledge}} of their own details is exhaustive and subtle, their knowledge of man and society, to which these are to be applied, is quite exceptionally superficial and silly. They know everything about biology, but almost nothing about life. Their ideas of history, for instance, are simply cheap and uneducated. Thus some famous and foolish professor measured the skull of Charlotte Corday to ascertain the criminal type; he had not historical knowledge {{enough to know that}} if there is any [...] "criminal type," [...] certainly Charlotte Corday had not got it. The skull, I believe, afterwards {{turned out not to be}} Charlotte Corday's at all; but that is another story. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> poor old man was trying to match Charlotte Corday's mind with her skull without knowing anything whatever about her mind.|$|E
6000|$|I cannot lay {{too great}} stress upon this high ethical righteousness {{of the whole}} oligarch class. This has been the {{strength}} of the Iron Heel, and too many of the comrades have been slow or loath to realize it. Many of them have ascribed {{the strength of the}} Iron Heel to its system of reward and punishment. This is a mistake. Heaven and hell may be the prime factors of zeal in the religion of a fanatic; but for the great majority of the religious, heaven and hell are incidental to right and wrong. Love of the right, desire for the right, unhappiness with anything less than the right--in short, right conduct, is the prime factor of religion. And so with the Oligarchy. Prisons, banishment and degradation, honors and palaces and wonder-cities, are all incidental. The great driving force of the oligarchs is the belief that they are doing right. Never mind the exceptions, and never mind the oppression and injustice in which the Iron Heel was conceived. All is granted. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> strength of the Oligarchy today lies in its satisfied conception of its own righteousness.* ...|$|E

60|$|Perhaps it may {{be thought}} that these demands are a little extreme; and that our fancy is running away with us. Nevertheless, {{it is not my}} Duke of Devonshire who is funny; but the real Duke of Devonshire. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scheme of titles is a misfit throughout: hardly {{anywhere}} do we find a modern man whose name and rank represent in any way his type, his locality, or his mode of life. As a mere matter of social comedy, the thing is worth noticing. You will meet a man whose name suggests a gouty admiral, and you will find him exactly like a timid organist: you will hear announced the name of a haughty and almost heathen grande dame, and behold the entrance of a nice, smiling Christian cook. These are light complications of the central fact of the falsification of all names and ranks. Our peers are like a party of mediaeval knights who should have exchanged shields, crests, and pennons. For the present rule seems to be that the Duke of Sussex may lawfully own the whole of Essex; and that the Marquis of Cornwall may own all the hills and valleys so long as they are not Cornish.|$|E
60|$|But, as {{a matter}} of fact, the man in the fur coat was not even an American millionaire, but simply an American. It did not signify luxury, but rather necessity, and even a harsh and almost heroic necessity. Orson {{probably}} wore a fur coat; and he was brought up by bears, but not the bears of Wall Street. Eskimos are generally represented as a furry folk; but they are not necessarily engaged in delicate financial operations, even in the typical and appropriate occupation called freezing out. And if the American is not exactly an arctic traveller rushing from pole to pole, at least he is often literally fleeing from ice to ice. He has to make a very extreme distinction between outdoor and indoor clothing. He has to live in an icehouse outside and a hothouse inside; so hot that he may be said to construct an icehouse inside that. He turns himself into an icehouse and warms himself against the cold until he is warm enough to eat ices. But <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same coat of fur which in England would indicate the sybarite life may here very well indicate the strenuous life; just as the same walking stick which would here suggest a lounger would in England suggest a plodder and almost a pilgrim.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the point}} is that this new American Anti-Semitism springs from {{experience}} and nothing but experience. There is no prejudice for it to spring from. Or rather the prejudice is all the other way. All the traditions of that democracy, and very creditable traditions too, are in favour of toleration and a sort of idealistic indifference. The sympathies in which these nineteenth-century people were reared were all against Front-de-Boeuf and in favour of Rebecca. They inherited a prejudice against Anti-Semitism; a prejudice of Anti-Anti-Semitism. These people of the plains have found the Jewish problem exactly as they might have struck oil; because it is there, and not even because they were looking for it. Their view of the problem, like their use of the oil, is not always satisfactory; and with parts of it I entirely disagree. But <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> thing which I call a problem, and others call a prejudice, has now appeared in broad daylight in a new country where there is no priestcraft, no feudalism, no ancient superstition to explain it. It has appeared because it is a problem; and those are the best friends of the Jews, including many of the Jews themselves, who are trying to find a solution. That is the meaning of the incident of Mr. Henry Ford of Detroit; and you will hardly hear an intelligible word about it in England.|$|E
