5|$|The velites {{were placed}} {{at the front of}} the maniples, so that the velites had the chance to prove {{themselves}} and win glory by seeking out single combat with an enemy. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> why they wore highly identifiable wolfskin headdresses.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> 5 times two {{verses of}} the Magnificat {{followed}} by a movement with a text that comes from elsewhere, the only bible quote of these other texts (movement C, also a doxology like the last movement) being coupled with the central 7th movement.|$|E

50|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> the Cavaliers {{final season}} playing at The Coliseum in Richfield, Ohio. Following the season, Nance retired. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> Daugherty's {{final year of}} his career as he missed all of next season due to injuries.|$|R
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> {{known as}} the {{dichotomy}} theorem for (undirected) graph homomorphisms, since it divides H-coloring problems into NP-complete or P problems, with no intermediate cases.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> {{the case}} for Belgian {{subjects}} until 28 April 2008, since Belgium denounced Chapter 1 of this treaty on such date. In a similar way, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> {{the case for}} Luxembourgian subjects until 10 July 2009.|$|R

[...] <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> the last tournament until 2010 to feature two private schools in the title game. <b>This</b> tournament <b>was</b> <b>also</b> the last until 2012 to feature no teams in the sweet 16 from the Mountain or Pacific Time Zones.|$|R
5|$|As seas {{surrounding}} Banton can {{be rough}} during the wet season, {{the best time}} to visit the island is from March to May during the dry (summer) season. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> the typical time for Asi families living in Metro Manila or abroad to visit the island since it coincides with the Lenten season and barangay fiestas. Within the island, the main forms of transportation are passenger motorcycles (known elsewhere as habal-habal) and motorized boats. A circumferential road connects the 17 barangays of Banton to each other.|$|E
5|$|Between Randville and {{the former}} {{community}} of Metropolitan, M-69 runs along the West Branch of the Sturgeon River through more hilly terrain. The trunkline continues east to the twin communities of Theodore and Felch. The river and the road part ways until meeting again at Foster City. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> {{the location of a}} unique junction of highways. M-69 meets G-69, a County-Designated Highway that runs south to Loretto in southern Dickinson County. The intersection in unique because some states, such as California, do not allow two highways to share a common number.|$|E
5|$|Carr Hill Nook {{has a high}} {{proportion}} of lone parent households at some 19.3% of all households. This is the fourth highest figure in Gateshead and compares with a borough average of 11.5%. Some 36.9% of households have dependent children, as opposed to 29.5% nationally and 28.4% in Gateshead. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> the fourth-highest figure in Gateshead. The Index of Multiple Deprivation, which divides England into 32,482 areas and measures quality of life to indicate deprivation, splits Carr Hill into halves and lists one half in the top 5% of all deprived areas in England in 2008. The other half is listed in the top 20% of all deprived areas.|$|E

The film was the second to be dedicated to his memory, after Corpse Bride (that showed the roles he had done in the other films directed by John Lasseter during the credits). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> the last (non-documentary) movie for Paul Newman before his retirement in 2007 and his death in 2008.

5|$|Cormorant {{fishing is}} the {{representative}} tourist attraction of Gifu. Though {{it occurs in}} many places in Japan, cormorant fishing on the Nagara River dates back more than 1,300 years. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> the largest display of cormorant fishing in all of Japan, with six fishing masters going down the river at the same time, using their birds to catch ayu sweetfish. The season lasts from May 11 to October 15 every year and occurs each night, except during high water levels and the harvest moon.|$|E
5|$|Excavations at Miletus, {{southwest}} Asia Minor, {{indicate the}} existence of a Mycenaean settlement there already from c. 1450 BC, replacing the previous Minoan installations. This site became a sizable and prosperous Mycenaean center until the 12th century BC. Apart from the archaeological evidence, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> attested in Hittite records, which indicate that Miletos (Milawata in Hittite) was the most important base for Mycenaean activity in Asia Minor. Mycenaean presence also reached the adjacent sites of Iasus and Ephesus.|$|E

5|$|Extensive {{deforestation}} {{has resulted}} in loss of trees such as acacias, baobab, dates and palm trees. This has also caused loss of natural habitat for wild animals; {{one of the main}} reasons for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> hunting and livestock farming by increasing human settlements. Populations of animals like lions, leopards and rhino have fallen significantly.|$|E
5|$|However, Swelim's {{theory is}} not widely accepted. Grimal, Helck, Wilkinson and Stadelmann {{point out that}} during the 3rd dynasty it became a fashion that royal stone bowls with {{polished}} surfaces showed only Horus names, without any guiding inscriptions. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> {{the case for the}} stone bowls of king Khaba. This decor style was practiced still under Sneferu, the founder of the 4th dynasty. Thus, Khaba is thought to have reigned close {{to the end of the}} Third Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|In 1891 local grocer Jonathan Stansfield {{constructed}} a solitary tower {{on the nearby}} summit of Blacko Hill. Today <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed {{at the time that}} he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.|$|E

5|$|In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times, the Egyptian climate {{was much}} less arid than it is today. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates. Foliage and fauna were far more {{prolific}} in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> the period when many animals were first domesticated.|$|E
5|$|In the autumn, species {{arrive from}} the north, some, such as black-tailed godwits, curlew {{sandpipers}} and little stints just passing through, pausing {{for a few}} days to refuel, others staying for the winter. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> a good time to see bearded reedlings. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds.|$|E
5|$|Kitchen Creek {{flows through}} the park's three glens, which the {{descriptions}} of the waterfalls are organized by: Ricketts Glen, Glen Leigh, and Ganoga Glen.
