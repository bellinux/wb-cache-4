5|$|Clark {{was then}} {{elected to the}} state Senate and served from 1832 to 1835. He {{was a member of}} the Committee for Internal Improvements.

Sir Charles Bressey's Highway Development Survey (also known as the Bressey Report), published in 1937, showed a -long South Circular that would have a new-build section near Wandsworth Bridge (<b>then</b> <b>being</b> rebuilt) but otherwise be a series of online improvements to existing roads.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods {{with the intention of}} eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by <b>then</b> <b>being</b> generated had to be given to the government.|$|E

5|$|Civil {{war broke}} out across England in 1642 between the {{supporters}} of King Charles I and Parliament. Fortifications and artillery {{played an important role}} in the conflict, and most of the Device Forts saw service. The south and east of England were soon largely controlled by Parliament. The blockhouses at Gravesend and Tilbury were garrisoned by Parliament and used to control access to London. The castles along the Sussex and Kentish coastline were seized by Parliament in the opening phase of the war, Camber Castle <b>then</b> <b>being</b> decommissioned to prevent it being used by the enemy, the remainder continuing to be garrisoned. The royal fleet, which had been positioned in the Downs anchorage, sided with Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1973. The airport {{needed to be}} built on permafrost. The runway is {{insulated}} against the ground, so it will not melt during the summer. The hangar is frozen into the ground, with the pillars being melted into place and <b>then</b> <b>being</b> frozen stuck. The runway was plagued with frost heave due to an incorrect construction method, forcing the airport to regularly re-asphalt the runway. In 1989, parts of the runway were re-insulated, giving these areas that previously had been the worst an acceptable solution. In 2006, this measure {{was conducted on the}} remaining parts of the runway. An upgrade to the terminal building to allow larger capacity was completed in 2007.|$|E

His memories returning, Jake joins up with the posse. During the evening, the group comes upon a capsized paddle wheel steamboat that the aliens apparently dumped {{hundreds of miles from}} any rivers capable of holding it. They camp in it, and during the night the alien they were tracking kills Meacham, who sacrifices himself to save Emmett, Taggart's grandson.|$|E

5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC <b>then</b> <b>being</b> connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E
5|$|Feth-i Bülend {{was ordered}} in 1867 from the Thames Iron Works, Blackwall Yard in London and was {{laid down in}} May 1868. She was {{launched}} in 1869 and began sea trials in 1870, being commissioned into the Ottoman Navy later that year. Upon completion, Feth-i Bülend and the other ironclads <b>then</b> <b>being</b> built in Britain and France were sent to Crete to assist in stabilizing the island {{in the aftermath of}} the Cretan Revolt of 18661869. During this period, the Ottoman fleet, under Hobart Pasha, remained largely inactive, with training confined to reading translated British instruction manuals.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, with Drumlin {{seeking to}} close SETI, Arroway discovers a signal repeating a {{sequence}} of prime numbers, apparently sent from the star system Vega some 26 light-years away.

Arroway's team then discover a video buried in the signal: Adolf Hitler's opening address at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Arroway and her team postulate that this would have been the first television signal strong enough to leave Earth's atmosphere, taking 26 years to reach Vega and <b>then</b> <b>being</b> transmitted back from there.|$|E
