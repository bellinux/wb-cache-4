5|$|Frank was autopsied twice, {{the second}} time to recover debris {{embedded}} in his body. The autopsy revealed that his lower extremities had been ripped off; his muscle tissue was extensively mutilated and torn; small pieces of wire, brass, and miscellaneous articles including a hat ornament were imbedded in various limbs; <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right hand were fractured and the bones splintered; and the distal phalanx of each finger on his left hand were missing. The coroner also observed numerous patches of blackened areas, similar to close-range gunshot residue. Four human finger bones were discovered among the wreckage at the primary crash site.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to disguise the flipper entirely when bowling, as the hand action is distinctly different from a leg break. When Clarrie Grimmett first began bowling the delivery, batsmen would listen for the telltale clicking sound of his fingers; to compensate, Grimmett would often click <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> non-bowling hand when not bowling the flipper to confuse the batsman.|$|E
25|$|In 1659, Aurangzeb {{sent his}} trusted general and {{maternal}} uncle Shaista Khan, the Wali in Golconda to recover forts {{lost to the}} Maratha rebels. Shaista Khan drove into Maratha territory and took up residence in Pune. But in a daring raid on the governor's palace in Pune during a midnight wedding celebration, the Marathas killed Shaista Khan's son and maimed Shaista Khan by cutting off <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand. Shaista Khan, however, survived and was re-appointed the administrator of Bengal going {{on to become a}} key commander in the war against the Ahoms.|$|E

25|$|The {{others can}} be {{standing}} or sitting. With the exception of Yakushi Nyorai, all statues are empty-handed and their fingers make a mudra. To the contrary, Yakushi Nyorai's right hand always holds some object, either a sphere or a small jar, while the other makes a mudra. Dainichi Nyorai's hands make a characteristic mudra (<b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left hand hold his right hand's index, see photo). Excepted Dainichi Nyorai, who is represented with some body ornamentation like a bodhisattva, all statues wear just a simple robe without body ornamentation, signs of priesthood. This is because they represent someone who has reached enlightenment. The robe can cover one or both shoulders. The head has a round protuberance on top with the hair divided in tight curls. Both features are exclusive characteristics of this rank, but the curls can be missing.|$|E
25|$|After some narrow {{escapes from}} the Allies in the {{immediate}} aftermath of World War II, Brunner fled West Germany in 1954, first for Egypt, then Syria, where he remained until his death. He was the object of many manhunts and investigations over the years by different groups, including the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Klarsfelds and others. He was condemned to death in absentia in France in 1954 for crimes against humanity. He lost an eye and then <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left hand as a result of letter bombs sent to him in 1961 and 1980, possibly by the Israeli Mossad. The government of Syria under Hafez el-Assad came close to extraditing him to East Germany, before this plan was halted by the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989. Brunner survived all the attempts to detain him, unrepentant about his activities to the end. During his long residence in Syria, Brunner was reportedly granted asylum, a generous salary and protection by the ruling Ba'ath Party in exchange for his advice on effective torture and interrogation techniques used by the Germans in World War II.|$|E

500|$|During {{his next}} start on July 14 against the Braves, Richard was {{pitching}} well and even struck {{out the side}} in the second inning, but had trouble seeing catcher Alan Ashby's signs and also had difficulty moving his arm. He left {{the game in the}} fourth inning after throwing a fastball and feeling his right arm go [...] "dead". He had numbness in <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right hand and could not grasp a baseball. The Astros placed Richard on the 21-day disabled list. As it turned out, it would be his last major league game.|$|E
500|$|The split-second {{incident}} {{only allowed}} Banks {{time for one}} conscious thought – that the shot was impossible to catch, {{and the only way}} to prevent Pelé from following up on the rebound would be to parry the ball over the bar. The ball bounced two yards in front of the goal-line, and Banks managed to make contact with the ball with <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right hand, and rolled his hand slightly to angle to ball over the crossbar. He landed in the inner netting of the goal, and knew he had saved the ball after witnessing Pelé's reaction. Banks then rose to his feet to defend the corner, and broke into laughter after the following exchange: ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 3, 1999, a {{monument}} in his honour was unveiled on boulevard René-Lévesque outside the Parliament Building in Quebec City. [...] The statue is popular with tourists, who snuggle up to it, {{to have their}} pictures taken [...] "avec René" [...] (with René), despite repeated attempts by officials {{to keep people from}} touching the monument or getting too close to it. The statue had been the source of an improvised, comical and affectionately touching tribute to Lévesque. <b>The</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> extended right hand are slightly parted, just enough so that tourists and the faithful could insert a cigarette, giving the statue an unusually realistic appearance.|$|E
2500|$|Shoko Asahara {{was finally}} found hiding within {{a wall of}} a cult {{building}} known as [...] "The 6th Satian" [...] in the Kamikuishiki complex on 16 May and was arrested. On the same day, the cult mailed a parcel bomb {{to the office of}} Yukio Aoshima, the governor of Tokyo, blowing off <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> secretary's hand. Asahara was initially charged with 23 counts of murder and 16 other offenses. The trial, dubbed [...] "the trial of the century" [...] by the press, ruled Asahara guilty of masterminding the attack and sentenced him to death. The indictment was appealed unsuccessfully. A number of senior members accused of participation, such as Masami Tsuchiya, also received death sentences.|$|E
2500|$|Freeman {{was injured}} in an {{automobile}} accident near Ruleville, Mississippi, on the night of August 3, 2008. The vehicle in which he was traveling, a 1997 Nissan Maxima, left the highway and flipped over several times. He and a female passenger, Demaris Meyer, were rescued from the vehicle using the [...] "Jaws of Life". Freeman was taken via medical helicopter to The Regional Medical Center (The Med) hospital in Memphis. Police ruled out alcohol as a factor in the crash. Freeman was coherent following the crash, as he joked with a photographer about taking his picture at the scene. His left shoulder, arm, and elbow were broken in the crash, and he had surgery on August 5, 2008. Doctors operated for four hours to repair nerve damage in his shoulder and arm. On CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight he stated that he is left handed but cannot move <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left hand. He wears a compression glove to protect against blood pooling due to non-movement. His publicist announced he was expected to make a full recovery. Meyer, his passenger, sued him for negligence, claiming that he was drinking the night of the accident. Subsequently, the suit was settled.|$|E

50|$|Another of Alvin's iconic posters was {{his work}} for Steven Spielberg's 1982 film, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.

The idea for the poster was reportedly suggested by Spielberg, and was inspired by Michelangelo's painting, The Creation of Adam. Alvin used his daughter as the human hand model for the poster.|$|R

He was smoking a black cigar, which he omitted to remove from between his teeth as he welcomed his visitor.|$|R
