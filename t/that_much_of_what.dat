5|$|Although not all Conservapedia {{contributors}} {{subscribe to}} a young-earth creationist point of view—former administrator Terry Koeckritz stated to the Los Angeles Times {{that he did not}} take the Genesis creation account literally—sources have attributed the poor science coverage to an overall editorial support of the young-earth creationist perspective and an over-reliance on Christian creationist home-schooling textbooks. In an analysis in early 2007, science writer Carl Zimmer found evidence <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> appeared to be inaccurate or inadequate information about science and scientific theory could be traced back to an over-reliance on citations from the works of home-schooling textbook author Jay L. Wile.|$|E

The last chapter, on Gödel's incompleteness theorem and Tarski's indefinability theorem, along with the article Quine (1946), became a launching point for Raymond Smullyan's later lucid exposition of these and related results.|$|E

Critics cite the soporific pace, the exaggerated melodrama, and the outdated social commentary as qualities present in A Place in the Sun that are not present in the great films of the era, such as those by Alfred Hitchcock and Elia Kazan, although the performances by Clift, Taylor, and Winters continue to receive praise.|$|E
25|$|Ecological {{economics}} generally {{rejects the}} view of energy economics that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well being, focusing instead on biodiversity and creativity - or natural capital and individual capital, in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically. In practice, ecological economics focuses primarily on the key issues of uneconomic growth and quality of life. Ecological economists are inclined to acknowledge <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is important in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences {{as a means to}} address this.|$|E

25|$|New {{antisemitism}} is {{the concept}} that {{a new form of}} antisemitism has developed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, emanating simultaneously from the far left, Islamism, and the far right, and that it tends to manifest itself as opposition to Zionism and the State of Israel. The concept generally posits <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is purported to be criticism of Israel by various individuals and world bodies, is, in fact, tantamount to demonization, and that, together with an alleged international resurgence of attacks on Jews and Jewish symbols, and an increased acceptance of antisemitic beliefs in public discourse, such demonization represents an evolution in the appearance of antisemitic beliefs.|$|E
25|$|In October 2017, the ONS {{revised the}} UK's balance of payments, {{changing}} the net {{international investment position}} from a surplus of £469bn to a deficit of £22bn. Deeper analysis of outward investment revealed <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was thought to be foreign debt securities owned by British companies were actually loans to British citizens. Inward investment also dropped, from a surplus of £120bn {{in the first half of}} 2016 to a deficit of £25bn in the same period of 2017. The UK had been relying on a surplus of inward investment to make up for its long-term current account deficit.

25|$|During a {{party at}} the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is {{pregnant}} with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually, he realizes <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy.|$|E

25|$|In Chile, Merlot {{thrives in}} the Apalta region of Colchagua Province. It is also grown in {{significant}} quantities in Curicó, Casablanca and the Maipo Valley. Until the early 1990s, the Chilean wine industry mistakenly sold a large quantity of wine {{made from the}} Carménère grape as Merlot. Following the discovery that many Chilean vineyards thought to be planted with Sauvignon blanc was actually Sauvignonasse, {{the owners of the}} Chilean winery Domaine Paul Bruno (who previously worked with Château Margaux and Château Cos d'Estournel) invited ampelographers to comb through their vineyards to make sure that their wines were properly identified. Genetic studies discovered <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> had been grown as Merlot was actually Carménère, an old French variety that had gone largely extinct in France due to its poor resistance to phylloxera. While the vines, leaves and grapes look very similar, both grapes produce wines with distinct characteristics — Carménère being more strongly flavored with green pepper notes and Merlot having softer fruit with chocolate notes.|$|E
25|$|The {{life and}} accomplishments of Pacificus of Verona has {{recently}} come under fire, most prominently by the Italian medievalist Cristina La Rocca. La Rocca makes an argument <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{is attributed to}} Pacificus {{is in fact a}} fabrication constructed by later medieval writers to support their own arguments. La Rocca argues that Pacificus, while still real and holding the position of archdeacon of Verona for some time, was not the illustrious, well-educated and charitable author, inventor and architect he is purported to be. La Rocca notes that Pacificus, {{along with the rest of}} the cathedral chapter, likely sided with King Bernard of Italy during his rebellion against his uncle, Emperor Louis the Pious, of whom the Veronese Bishop Ratoldus was a staunch supporter. According to La Rocca, this rivalry between Pacificus the Archdeacon and Ratoldus the Bishop likely ended with Pacificus' banishment following the failure of Bernard's rebellion, a fact supported by the fact that a monk named Pacificus (a relatively rare name) appears in the records of the Abbey of Nonantola in 826. If Pacificus was banished, it is likely that he remained in Nonantola until his death.|$|E
25|$|The {{additional}} funding, though significant, {{expanded the}} scope of the game and causes some setbacks, and for some periods, the Greens lived off loans and donations during the development. Following Joel's death March 2014, Ryan was further committed to completing the game to honor Joel's memory and as a way to cope with his loss, and turned back to work a few days after Joel's funeral. The game, up to that point, had been written based on unknowing of Joel's fate, but with his death, the team recognized <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they had in place was more focused on the narrative from Ryan and Amy's side, and made it feel more of a selfish work. There were also concerns from investors about the interactivity of the title. They rewrote about 70% of the game to make it more focused on the interactions with Joel. Originally, the game would have ended with the player witnessing a machine with numerous levers that could be pulled, giving the player some sense of control, but when they examined the machine's internals, found that all of the levers were disconnected, and that they had no control of the situation. Following Joel's death, they felt this scene was no longer applicable, and instead replaced it with the players interacting a final time with Joel in a cathedral in an afterlife-type setting as to bring closure to their story. With the change, Ryan hoped that the game would help others to cope and open up with others with the loss of loved ones. One design decision made was to represent the characters in the game with feature-less faces. Ryan stated that this was both that being a small team they did not have the technical capability to fully program and animate the character's faces, and that by leaving the faces feature-less, it would help players engage by imagining themselves in the place of the game's characters.|$|E

In late 1794 the jurist Edward Christian, brother of Fletcher, published his Appendix to the court martial proceedings, which was said by the press to [...] "palliate the behaviour of Christian and the Mutineers, and to criminate Captain Bligh".
