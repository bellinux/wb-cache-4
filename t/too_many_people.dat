5|$|The trial {{started on}} February 4, 2013. Blythe testified {{that when he}} wanted to see the club before the concert, Lamb of God's {{technician}} told him that the club was terrible and messy. According to Blythe, the technician went on, saying that the stage was small, there were <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> and that it was rather dangerous.|$|E
5|$|In Pasadena, {{high school}} {{students}} Costa and J.B. plan to throw a party for their friend Thomas' birthday, aiming to increase their popularity. Thomas' parents go away for the weekend, leaving him alone in the house, but warn him not to have <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> over, and not to drive his father's Mercedes. Thomas is reluctant to have the party at his house, but Costa continues with his plan. Costa hires AV-student Dax to chronicle the night's events. Costa and J.B. advertise the party throughout the school. Thomas himself invites Alexis, the hottest girl at school, and his best friend Kirby, who has a crush on Thomas.|$|E
5|$|The Little Tern colony at Holkham, holding seven {{per cent}} of the British population, is cordoned off in the {{breeding}} season, with signs explaining why people are excluded from the area. The dune vegetation can be damaged by <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> walking over it, leading to blowout, the rapid wind erosion of the sand. Boardwalks and steps enable visitors to reach the beach on foot without harming the dunes, and horse riders and naturists are asked {{to stay on the}} beach and keep off the dunes. As the climate becomes warmer in the future, there is likely to be more tourism pressure on the coasts, but the effects of this may be mitigated by a move towards lower-impact activities like bathing.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E
5|$|The coyote {{plays a role}} {{in various}} mythologies and {{creation}} myths of Native American folklore. It is variously credited for having brought fire to humanity, releasing the bison into the world, and of having slain monsters by petrifying them. The Maidu creation myth has the coyote introducing work, suffering, and death to the world. Zuni folklore has the coyote bringing winter into the world by stealing light from the kachinas. Some tribes, such as the Chinook, Maidu, Paiute, Pawnee, Tohono O'odham, and Ute portray the coyote as the companion of the creator. In the Paiute creation myth, the coyote was created by the wolf as a companion, and the two created land by piling soil on the water-covered world. A Tohono O'odham flood myth has the coyote helping Montezuma survive a global deluge that destroys humanity. After the Great Mystery creates humanity, the coyote and Montezuma teach people how to live. The Crow creation myth portrays Old Man Coyote as the creator. In Navajo mythology, the coyote was present in the First World with First Man and First Woman, though a different version has it being created in the Fourth World. The Navajo coyote brings death into the world, explaining that without death, <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> would exist, thus no room to plant corn.|$|E
25|$|<b>Too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> using a toilet: This is {{especially}} true in case of shared or public toilets. If <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> want to use a toilet at the same time, then some people may go outside to defecate instead of waiting. In some cases, people {{might not be able to}} wait due to diarrhea (or result of an Irritable Bowel Syndrome emergency).|$|E
5000|$|Lark was Mayor of Cranston 1945-1953 and {{eventually}} was in contention {{for a seat}} in the U.S. Senate in the early 1950s. Lark had lost reelection because of controversial opinions and his attempts to confront mob activity in the Rhode Island business market. In a period in which illegal and underground activity was a prominent and significant source of revenue in the business sector, Lark's platform particularly focused on the elimination of illegal business ventures. As a result many said he [...] "turned <b>too</b> <b>many</b> heads" [...] and [...] "stepped on <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people's</b> feet", leading to his eventual dismissal.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2011, Hogsett {{announced}} {{the creation of}} a Violent Crime Initiative, saying at the time that [...] "for <b>too</b> <b>many</b> young <b>people,</b> it is easier to get a gun than an education. That is unacceptable." ...|$|R

25|$|John Chapman was Director of Sydney's Department of Evangelism (now Evangelism Ministries) from 1970 until 1995. He {{used his}} {{ability as a}} public speaker and evangelist to promote local church missions. Evangelism thus became a {{priority}} within the Sydney Anglican churches at {{around the same time}} that church-going became less important to mainstream Australia. Chapman's influence ensured that Sydney Anglicans were able to mobilise in evangelism to prevent <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> from leaving the churches.|$|E
25|$|According to Greek mythology, Zeus {{had become}} {{king of the}} gods by overthrowing his father Cronus; Cronus in turn had overthrown his father Uranus. Zeus was not {{faithful}} {{to his wife and}} sister Hera, and had many relationships from which many children were born. Since Zeus believed that there were <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> populating the earth, he envisioned Momus or Themis, who was to use the Trojan War as a means to depopulate the Earth, especially of his demigod descendants.|$|E

60|$|In other words, we {{must ask}} what modern {{institution}} has a future before it? What modern institution may have swollen to six times its present size in the social heat and growth of the future? I {{do not think the}} Garden City will grow: but of that I may speak in my next and last article of this series. I do not think even the ordinary Elementary School, with its compulsory education, will grow. <b>Too</b> <b>many</b> unlettered <b>people</b> hate the teacher for teaching; and <b>too</b> <b>many</b> lettered <b>people</b> hate the teacher for not teaching. The Garden City will not bear much blossom; the young idea will not shoot, unless it shoots the teacher. But the one flowering tree on the estate, the one natural expansion which I think will expand, is the institution we call the Prison.|$|R
25|$|World Health Organization (WHO) {{criteria}} for {{impaired fasting glucose}} differs from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria, because the normal range of glucose is defined differently by each. Fasting plasma glucose levels 100mg/dL (5.5mmol/L) and higher {{have been shown to}} increase complication rates significantly, however, WHO opted to keep its upper limit of normal at under 110mg/dL for fear of causing <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> to be diagnosed as having impaired fasting glucose, whereas the ADA lowered the upper limit of normal to a fasting plasma glucose under 100mg/dL.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} voting in the United States. Even though most {{people say that}} voting is important, and a good {{practice}} for them to do, every year a sub-optimal percentage of Americans turn up to vote, especially in presidential elections (only 51% in the 2000 election). One vote may feel very small {{in a group of}} millions, so people may not think a vote is worth the time and effort. If <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> think this way, there is a small percentage of voter turnout. Some countries enforce compulsory voting to reduce this effect.|$|E
25|$|The first actual {{demonstration}} of the day took place in New Zealand where 10,000 people demonstrated in Auckland and Wellington. The Auckland march was bigger than expected, forcing police to shut off Queen Street. People were reported to be still starting the march as those {{at the front of}} the march reached a rally in Myers Park several kilometres away. In Wellington the march had to carry on after the then planned end point as there were <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> to fit into the park. There were also protests in at least 18 other centres, including Dunedin, Thames, Opotiki, Whakatane, Whangarei, Timaru and Rotorua, and Picnic for Peace in Christchurch.|$|E

25|$|Tom Ridge: I’m {{familiar}} with his claims. I’m not {{familiar with}} how accurate they are. This is a global scourge. It’s really a case of first impression for everybody. As {{secretary of homeland security}} after 9/11, I dare say America was confronted with a set of challenges it had never seen before and we acted with what we thought was in the best interest for securing America. We also looked back at what we did and made some adjustments. I’ll just leave it at that. We can kill bin Laden and eliminate a lot of these other extremists, but that whole belief system is out there. It doesn’t take <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> to buy in to it to cause enormous damage.|$|E
25|$|Pit latrines {{may or may}} not be {{an enjoyable}} {{experience}} to use. Problems may occur when the pit latrine is shared by <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people,</b> is not cleaned daily and not emptied when the pit is full. In such cases, flies and odour can be a massive nuisance. Also, pit latrines are usually dark places which are difficult to keep clean. Often, handwashing facilities are missing. For these reasons, shared pit latrines can be quite uncomfortable to use in developing countries. Also, there might be cultural preferences for open defecation and these may be difficult to overcome with unattractive toilet designs. This is currently being discussed amongst experts for the example in the case of rural India where behavior change campaigns are needed to reduce open defecation.|$|E
25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. <b>Too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E
50|$|One long {{campaign}} by Johnson was to improve psychiatric services on the National Health Service.

50|$|In ten years, Quebec had {{undergone}} a dramatic change. What worked for Carleton in 1774 was not likely to succeed in 1784. Specifically, there was no possibility of restoring the previous political balance - there were simply <b>too</b> <b>many</b> English <b>people</b> unwilling to reach a compromise with the 145,000 Canadiens or their colonial governor. The situation called for a more creative approach to problem solving.|$|R
25|$|The first ostensive {{goal of a}} BMX racer is {{to become}} the number one amateur racer in your district. The racer's home state/province maybe divided up into several Districts {{depending}} how many participants and how spread out they are over the state/province. A balance is sought. <b>Too</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> in a single district could discourage new, inexperienced riders from having {{a sense of accomplishment}} if they are doing reasonably well but not advancing his point score up the list of total points in relation to other racers. Too small a district would cheapen any sense of accomplishment due to paucity of racers, producing an artificially high ranking for the following season for the racer(s) in the points race. Points determine how well you do in the district rankings. How high you go in the rankings depends on what skill level category you are in as well as how well you do in your particular races since it affects how many points you win, which adds to your total for your district ranking. The higher your skill level, the more points you will gather at any given race (providing that you have qualified for the Main).|$|E
