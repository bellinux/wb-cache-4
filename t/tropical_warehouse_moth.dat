50|$|The {{almond moth}} or <b>tropical</b> <b>warehouse</b> <b>moth</b> (Cadra cautella) {{is a small}} stored-product pest. It belongs to the snout moths (family Pyralidae), more {{specifically}} to the tribe Phycitini of the huge snout moth subfamily Phycitinae. This species is often confused with the related Indian mealmoth (Plodia interpunctella).|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{synthetic}} pyrethroid, Fenom ® on the gamma-irradiated <b>Tropical</b> <b>Warehouse</b> <b>Moth,</b> Cadra cautella (Walker) (Lepidoptera:Phycitidae) larvae have been studied. Both the insecticide and gamma irradiation either singly or in combination, significantly increased larval mortality and developmental periods. The pupation and adult eclosion, reproductive potential and longevity of the adults from treated larvae were significantly decreased...|$|E

50|$|Ephestia elutella, the cacao moth, tobacco <b>moth</b> or <b>warehouse</b> <b>moth,</b> {{is a small}} moth of {{the family}} Pyralidae. It is {{probably}} native to Europe, but has been transported widely, even to Australia. A subspecies is E. e. pterogrisella.|$|R
40|$|Previous ultrastructural studies {{appear to}} {{indicate}} that the lacinate appendages (highly elaborated laminar structures which cover the surface of moth spermatozoa) may be intra-cellular derivatives of transient microtubules found in the elongating spermatids of these insects. Additional support for this theory is supplied by the present study in which testes of the <b>warehouse</b> <b>moth</b> Ephestia cantella were treated in vivo with the antimitotic agent vinblastine sulphate. Solutions containing io~ 5 M vinblastine caused the lacinate appendages to become poorly resolved, and at io~ 3 M they disappeared. This concentration-dependent response of the appendages to vinblastine resembles that of tubulin-containing structures...|$|R
40|$|Entomologists at ICRISAT, India have {{identified}} 11 arthropod groupings or taxa as major field pests of groundnuts. Their research is concentrated on 8 of these groupings and covers all relevant {{aspects of the}} contemporary pest control options. A common theme is rationalizing insecticide usage. A long-term, but achievable goal is the incorporation of multiple pest resistance into all cultivars released by ICRISAT. Termites, the thrips Frankliniella schultzei (Trybom) (a virus vector), the tobacco cutworm Spodoptera litura (F.), and the groundnut leafminer Aproaerema modicella (Deventer) have been selected as subjects of indepth studies. The bruchid, Caryedon serratus (Olivier), {{has been identified as}} a potential pest of stored groundnuts in India. Kernels of groundnut genotypes are being tested for resistance to three other postharvest pests, the rust-red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum Hbst., the rice moth Corcyra cephalonica (Stnt.), and the <b>warehouse</b> <b>moth</b> Ephestia cautella (Walker) by means of techniques specially developed at ICRISAT Center...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Accumulation {{began to}} act upon its new consciousness. The iron roads united; the warring {{industries}} made peace, each kind {{under a single}} leadership. Monopoly, not competition, was seen to be the beneficent means of distributing the favors and blessings of the Accumulation to mankind. But, as before, there was alternately a glut and dearth of things, and it often happened that when starving men went ragged through the streets the storehouses were piled full of rotting harvests that the farmers toiled from dawn till dusk to grow, and the <b>warehouses</b> fed the <b>moth</b> with the stuffs that the operative had woven his life into at his loom. Then followed, with a blind and mad succession, a time of famine, when money could not buy the super-abundance that vanished, none knew how or why.|$|R
