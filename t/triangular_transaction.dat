50|$|Mere {{existence}} of triangular arbitrage opportunities {{does not necessarily}} imply that a trading strategy seeking to exploit currency mispricings is consistently profitable. Electronic trading systems allow the three constituent trades in a triangular arbitrage transaction to be submitted very rapidly. However, there exists a delay between the identification of such an opportunity, the initiation of trades, {{and the arrival of}} trades to the party quoting the mispricing. Even though such delays are only milliseconds in duration, they are deemed significant. For example, if a trader places each trade as a limit order to be filled only at the arbitrage price and a price moves due to market activity or new price is quoted by the third party, then the <b>triangular</b> <b>transaction</b> will not be completed. In such a case, the arbitrageur will face a cost to close out the position that is equal to the change in price that eliminated the arbitrage condition.|$|E
40|$|A {{position}} paper on <b>triangular</b> <b>transactions</b> in grain trade and also looks at major issues in maize production, export, and stockholding policy of Zimbabwe. This paper first reviews Zimbabwe’s experience {{in dealing with}} <b>triangular</b> <b>transactions</b> in grain trade. Second, it examines major issues in maize production, export, and stockholding policy. Finally, it looks at the domestic wheat industry. In this section, research areas which are relevant for promoting grain production and regional trade arc identified. It is hoped that the tentative observations highlighted in this paper will stimulate further analysis of the important issues in pricing policy, import substitution, grain stock management, export promotion, and comparative advantage relevant {{to the production of}} agricultural products to achieve food security. The research supporting the preparation the proceedings papers was financed by the U. S. Agency for International Development, Bureau of Science and Technology; Bureau for Africa; and the Southern Africa Regional Programme...|$|R
40|$|Romania's EU {{accession}} {{made significant}} changes in the tax area imposed by the harmonization of national laws system of member countries. Thus it disappeared the concepts of export and import in the relationship between Member States, which are replaced by new notions, such as: intra-community acquisition (instead of import) and intra-community supply (instead of export). Given the changes occurring in the tax laws and their complexity, in this paper/work I proposed to approach the specific tax treatment inside-community with reference to <b>triangular</b> <b>transactions.</b> tranzactions, tax treatment, triangular operations, intra-community delivery, inside-community acquisition, member state...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a microscopic model which describes {{the dynamics of}} each dealer in multiple foreign exchange markets, taking account of the <b>triangular</b> arbitrage <b>transaction.</b> The model reproduces the interaction among the markets well. We explore {{the relation between the}} parameters of the present microscopic model and the spring constant of a macroscopic model that we proposed previously. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{first show}} that there are in fact {{triangular}} arbitrage opportunities in the spot foreign exchange markets, analyzing the time dependence of the yen-dollar rate, the dollar-euro rate and the yen-euro rate. Next, we propose a model of foreign exchange rates with an interaction. The model includes effects of <b>triangular</b> arbitrage <b>transactions</b> as an interaction among three rates. The model explains the actual data of the multiple foreign exchange rates well. ...|$|R
40|$|AEE Working Paper. The {{potential}} for Zimbabwe to develop viable small grain export markets within the SADCC region will depend crucially on: 1. Zimbabwe's {{ability to produce}} reliable marketed sorghum and millet surpluses at a cost low enough to be competitive with C. I. F. import prices of coarse grains in other SADCC countries: and 2. the development of reliable and effective import demand for small grains among other SADCC countries. Inherent within conditions (1) are questions related to the incidence of response to increased small grain production incentives, the strong random influence of weather as a determinant of small grain export supplies, transport constraints and other marketing problems. Within conditions (2) are issued concerning the reliability of weather-induced import demand within the region, the enthusiasm of donors to finance <b>triangular</b> <b>transactions</b> over the long run, and the scope for other SADCC countries to translate their stated food self-sufficiency goal in reality. This paper examines the {{potential for}} these two fundamental conditions to be met, and more broadly considers whether their achievement would actually be consistent with Zimbabwe's agricultural policy objectives...|$|R
40|$|Considering {{the purpose}} of {{conducting}} any foreign trade transaction, which is generally limited to obtaining a commercial advantage by attracting foreign contribution with the smallest costs and considering {{the role of the}} accounting information and the need to involve it in decision-making due to its increased credibility and relevance in the eyes of internal and external users, in what follows we intend to develop accounting models specific to <b>triangular</b> foreign trade <b>transactions</b> in relation to the transport contractual relations established between the partners involved in such operations, but only after we shall first analyze the fiscal issues that influence the entries into accounts of such commercial businesses. Thus, in order to achieve the goals set through the scientific approach that targeted the accounting information and management of <b>triangular</b> foreign trade <b>transactions,</b> the research methods used were based both on general and specific approaches, using in particular documentation, case study or benchmarking, an aspect that allowed us to conclude that the study made has also acquired an empirical nature, in addition to the descriptive one, materialized in the analysis carried out on tax and accounting information from the entities performing foreign trade, a research whose information support is based, in addition to the studied literature related to the investigated field, on the tax, customs and accounting laws specific to <b>triangular</b> foreign trade <b>transactions,</b> but also on the data collected from the entities under study. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{squeeze in}} United States dollar {{liquidity}} that emerged {{with the global}} financial crisis highlighted the risks inherent in the current global financial system. Asia was adversely affected by the crisis {{not only because of}} its dependence on trade, but also because of its heavy reliance on the US dollar for regional and international transactions. As Asia's role in the global economy continues to expand, its dependence on the US dollar is bound to increase, raising further its vulnerability to future liquidity shocks. The use of regional currencies for bilateral trade settlement could reduce such vulnerability. As demonstrated by the renminbi trade settlement scheme piloted between the People's Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; and Macao, China, the existence of appropriate financial infrastructure could reduce the relatively larger costs of bilateral currency <b>transactions</b> compared with <b>triangular</b> <b>transactions</b> through the United States dollar. As most central banks are securities depositories of government bonds, combining trade settlement with government bond securities settlement could also have large synergy effects without substantial extra costs. This proposal does not require full liberalization of the capital account or full deregulation of capital markets, and is more politically feasible in transition. As such, extending the trade settlement scheme to the rest of Asia and appending a government bond payment and securities settlement system could be a practical solution to international monetary system reform and the diversification of settlement currencies...|$|R
50|$|For example, Citibank detects that Deutsche Bank is quoting {{dollars at}} a bid price of 0.8171 €/$, and that Barclays is quoting pounds at a bid price of 1.4650 $/£ (Deutsche Bank and Barclays are {{in other words}} willing to buy those {{currencies}} at those prices). Citibank itself is quoting the same prices for these two exchange rates. A trader at Citibank then sees that Crédit Agricole is quoting pounds at an ask price of 1.1910 €/£ (in other words {{it is willing to}} sell pounds at that price). While the quoted market cross exchange rate is 1.1910 €/£, Citibank's trader realizes that the implicit cross exchange rate is 1.1971 €/£ (by calculating 1.4650 × 0.8171 = 1.1971), meaning that Crédit Agricole has narrowed its bid-ask spread to serve as a market maker between the euro and the pound. Although the market suggests the implicit cross exchange rate should be 1.1971 euros per pound, Crédit Agricole is selling pounds at a lower price of 1.1910 euros. Citibank's trader can hastily exercise triangular arbitrage by exchanging dollars for euros with Deutsche Bank, then exchanging euros for pounds with Crédit Agricole, and finally exchanging pounds for dollars with Barclays. The following steps illustrate the <b>triangular</b> arbitrage <b>transaction.</b>|$|R
