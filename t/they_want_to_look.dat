Objectives: The objective {{of this paper was}} {{to assess the impact of}} media on attitude to management of skin ageing in women aged 60 or over. Design: Transcripts from each one hour, semi-structured, audio-recorded interview with each participant (N= 21) were thematically analysed. Methods: Ethical approval was obtained from the University of the Arts London prior to conducting the study. The participants were an opportunity sample of 21 women aged over 60 (mean age: 65 years recruited in response to a University call for participants. Of these, 11 participants had used medical interventions, but not cosmetic surgery, to manage their skin ageing. All participants took part in a one-hour interview which was thematically analysed independently by two of the authors. Results: Four themes emerged from the data: (i) the use of anti-aging skin care and sun screen products and regimes; (ii) sources of advice for these; (iii) attitudes towards cosmetic surgery; and (iv) the influence of the media. Conclusions: The participants used a range of anti-aging skin care products and regimes in a variety of ways, sought advice from different sources and were generally not interested in undergoing cosmetic surgery. Despite ubiquitous media images of unattainable, airbrushed, ‘beauty’, and messages equating youth with beauty generally reported satisfaction with the way they managed their skin ageing.

50|$|The {{photographic}} series Daniela Rossell is {{best known}} for is Ricas y Famosas (Rich and Famous), which spanned over the years 1994-2001 and was published as a book in 2009. The first models for these photographs were as friends and family of the artist, who were Mexican elite, and then began to spread to other elite women who volunteered to model. Each model chooses how to depict their identity surrounded by their lavish material items and selling sex appeal in their poses. Rossell believes that her models are influenced by magazines and television show how they should perform {{in front of the camera}} because <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> American. This quest to look American requires these models to modify their lifestyle and manipulation of identity that is a form of unhappiness. Despite having materialistically everything, these women struggle to find satisfaction in who they are because of the fantasy portrayed of America. When looking at the photographs is the large amounts of art and non-Christian icons mixed with Christian art found in these lavish homes. For example, one woman is posed lying seductively across a massive sized Buddha surrounded by champagne and money. The juxtaposition between sacred object and sexual attraction makes for a conflicting yet entertaining subject.|$|E
5000|$|One of Ringo's biggest storylines saw him {{develop an}} eating disorder. A writer for Holy Soap {{said that this}} is one of the first times in a soap opera that a male {{character}} has been at the centre of such a storyline. Ringo had suffered with anorexia in the past and he later had a relapse. Ringo refuses to admit that he has a problem with his addiction to losing weight. He almost drowns in a school swimming race due to lack of food and this leaves him feeling bad about himself. Rosetta Cammeniti (Natalie Saleeba) catches Ringo taking appetite suppressants, which leaves her upset by the situation. Clark said that until that moment, Ringo had concealed his problem from everyone but Pepper Steiger (Nicky Whelan). He added [...] "Even Pepper thought he had the issue under control, but this is where it all comes to a head." [...] Rosetta confronts Ringo and he is embarrassed and takes his anger out on her because he has been struggling with his problem for a long time. During an interview with Last Broadcast, Clark said that he believes guys are going through the same insecurities as girls, where <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like their heroes, such as soccer stars. He added that he was able to deal with the storyline because a close friend had suffered from anorexia. Clark later said that as eating disorders are on the rise among males, he believed the storyline was [...] "realistic." [...] On whether the storyline would carry on, Clark said [...] "The only drawback was giving it the attention it requires. Because of the limitations of storylines, it would have been impossible to continue with this subject for too long. In reality, of course, eating disorders can continue for years." [...] During a 2008 interview with TV Week Clark named the eating disorder storyline as his favourite storyline on the show so far. He also called it the hardest storyline because he had to really focus and get involved in it.|$|E

40|$|Background: The video-distortion method on {{a life-size}} screen {{is one of}} the new methods to {{systematically}} study the body experience of eating-disordered patients. Methods: Using this method, we have studied body-size estimation in female patients suffering from eating disorders: anorexia nervosa restricting type (n= 87) and mixed type (n= 34); bulimia nervosa (n= 44), and a normal control group (n = 45). Subjects had to estimate a neutral object (neutral response) and their own body size: what they think they really look like (cognitive response); what they feel they look like (affective response), and what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like (optative response). Results: No significant differences were found for the neutral and the cognitive response. Eating-disordered patients clearly did not overestimate their body size. The different subgroups showed interesting differences in the degree of discrepancy between cognitive and affective responses, and in the thinness of their body ideal. Conclusions: Researchers should focus on these elements of body experience, because they are clinically far more relevant than the simple question of over/underestimation. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The video {{distortion}} method on {{a life-size}} screen {{is a new}} method for studying eating disordered patients' estimations of their own body width. Testing this method in female patients (53 with anorexia nervosa, 38 with bulimia nervosa) and 36 normal females, yielded high to very high reliability scores (consistency and test-retest stability). A careful analysis of the 'just noticeable difference' showed that a 5 % deviation from the undistorted image {{should be considered as}} within the range of accuracy. Taking this into account, anorectic patients appear to score below, above, as well as within the normal range. Bulimia nervosa patients are either accurate in their body estimations or overestimate their body width. All control Ss are correct in their estimations. With this method {{no significant differences were found}} between the anorectic patients and the Controls.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between body size estimation {{on the one hand}} and clinical and psychological variables on the other. Method: Body size estimation was tested with the video distortion method on a life-size screen in normal women (n = 45) and compared to a fetal of 189 female eating disorder patients (100 with restricting anorexia nervosa, 41 with binging/purging anorexia nervosa, 48 with bulimia nervosa). The subjects' cognitive responses (what they think they really look like), affective responses (what they feel they look like), and optative responses (what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like) were correlated with clinical parameters (including body composition) and with the scores on a series of self-report questionnaires assessing general psychological well-being and body experience. Results: No significant relationship was found between the body size estimations and the clinical variables. The cognitive and affective responses showed a moderate relationship with self-reported body attitude. Body dissatisfaction was negatively correlated with the optative response (desired body size). Discussion: This study contributes to the construct validity of the video distort ion method. Body size estimation includes more than just a perceptual task. Hence, the narrow notion of body image should be replaced by the more complex construct of "body experience," the multidimensionality of which should be addressed in both research and treatment of eating-disordered patients.
