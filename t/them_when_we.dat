500|$|The main {{themes in}} the album, in Adams words are; [...] "searching for something". The lyrical meaning behind track number four, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is what a person needs in order to survive. In other words, [...] "The person you are with is giving you the air you breathe", and that people in general [...] "need each other 100%." [...] The album's first single, [...] "I Thought I'd Seen Everything" [...] is about keeping an open mind." [...] The theme of [...] "Broken Wings" [...] is about [...] "{{somebody}} who {{taught me how to}} fly", a metaphor which for [...] "putting your trust in somebody who can give you faith and the belief that you can succeed." [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] is based upon the affirmation of life and faith, while [...] "Walk on By" [...] warns the listener of distrustfulness. As with other albums, according to Adams, he likes to end the album with a melancholic song, such as [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] in 11, it's not the last track however. [...] "Flowers Gone Wild" [...] touches on the same theme as two songs he wrote in the early 1980s, [...] "Cover Girl" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet To Come", are based upon the murdered playboy bunny Dorothy Stratten. But also people with misplaced emotions and their unfulfilled needs, which are pushed forth by the media, which Adams says, leads people to lose their [...] "sense of decency". Adams explained further; [...] "It's a sort of new love affair with an old story, devouring our celebrities and leaving <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are done." ...|$|E
2500|$|The unicorn, tamable only by {{a virgin}} woman, was well {{established}} in medieval lore by the time Marco Polo described them as [...] "scarcely smaller than elephants. They have the hair of a buffalo and feet like an elephant's. They have a single large black horn {{in the middle of}} the forehead... They have a head like a wild boar's… They spend their time by preference wallowing in mud and slime. They are very ugly brutes to look at. They are not at all such as we describe <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> relate that they let themselves be captured by virgins, but clean contrary to our notions." [...] It is clear that Marco Polo was describing a rhinoceros. In German, since the 16th century, Einhorn ("one-horn") has become a descriptor of the various species of rhinoceros.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 August 1972, Clough and Taylor signed David Nish from Leicester City, for a then-record {{transfer}} fee of £225,000, without consulting the Derby board. Afterwards, Jack Kirkland, a director, warned Clough and Taylor {{there would be}} no more expensive buys like Nish. Then, on 3 September 1972, after the team had defeated Liverpool 2–1 at the Baseball Ground, Clough criticised the Derby County fans, stating that [...] "They started chanting only near the end when we were a goal in front. I want to hear <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are losing. They are a disgraceful lot". In the same interview, Clough also verbally attacked the club's board of directors for their policies. The following day, Board chairman Sam Longson apologised to the fans and dissociated himself from Clough's remarks.|$|E

2500|$|... 23. We {{are fully}} aware of the {{difficulties}} confronting the public authorities in this matter, especially in the developing countries. In fact, We had in mind the justifiable anxieties which weigh upon <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>We</b> published Our encyclical letter Populorum Progressio. But now We join Our voice to that of Our predecessor John XXIII of venerable memory, and We make Our own his words: [...] "No statement of the problem and no solution to it is acceptable which does violence to man's essential dignity; those who propose such solutions base them on an utterly materialistic conception of man himself and his life. The only possible solution to this question is one which envisages the social and economic progress both of individuals and of the whole of human society, and which respects and promotes true human values." [...] No one can, without being grossly unfair, make divine Providence responsible for what clearly seems {{to be the result of}} misguided governmental policies, of an insufficient sense of social justice, of a selfish accumulation of material goods, and finally of a culpable failure to undertake those initiatives and responsibilities which would raise the standard of living of peoples and their children.|$|E
2500|$|Loudoun's {{progress}} {{towards the}} goal of capturing Louisbourg {{appears to have been}} too cautious for Hay's liking. The French had sent heavy naval reinforcements, and the attack was called off. Hay had arrived at Halifax on 9 July and was dismayed at the inaction of his superiors. Colonel John Forbes overheard him criticising the conduct of the campaign, commenting while their troops exercised in a sham attack that [...] "by God, difficult as it may be, I shall find a method of letting the mother country know what is doing here, that we are taken up in building sham forts and making approaches to <b>them,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> should be employed in real attacks. The fleet should sail up the bason, and have a sham fight there; and then we might write home that we had a sea fight and taken a fort." [...] He was also said to have commented that [...] "the general was keeping the courage of his majesty's troops at bay, and expending the nation's wealth in making sham sieges and planting cabbages when he ought to have been fighting." [...] The news reached Loudoun, who had Hay arrested in July for [...] "uttering various opprobrious and disrespectful speeches". He did not press a charge though, instead suggesting that [...] "the voyage, climate and season of the year have been prejudicial to his Lordship’s health." [...] The implication was that Hay had gone mad, or suffered a breakdown, and he was closely confined for seven months while awaiting passage back to England. He volunteered for service aboard the 74-gun , which had arrived in Halifax in May 1758 under the command of Captain George Brydges Rodney, carrying Major-General Jeffery Amherst. Hay observed the successful siege and capture of Louisbourg from the Dublin, before his return to England aboard [...]|$|E

They'd killed 'em all and was eatin' of <b>'em</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> jumps <b>'em.</b> Before we knew wot had {{happened}} {{about a thousand}} more of the devils came runnin' up.
