5|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> {{complicated}} because sea otters {{have sometimes}} been {{held responsible for}} declines of shellfish stocks that were more likely caused by overfishing, disease, pollution, and seismic activity. Shellfish declines have also occurred {{in many parts of}} the North American Pacific coast that do not have sea otters, and conservationists sometimes note the existence of large concentrations of shellfish on the coast is a recent development resulting from the fur trade's near-extirpation of the sea otter. Although many factors affect shellfish stocks, sea otter predation can deplete a fishery to the point where it is no longer commercially viable. Scientists agree that sea otters and abalone fisheries cannot exist in the same area, and the same is likely true for certain other types of shellfish, as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate among}} monks unfolds in the {{presence}} of their teachers, with a very well set rules of procedure for the defender and the questioners. The tradition of such debates is traced to the ancient ‘Hindu Orthodoxy’ in India and this practice permeated into Buddhist orthodoxy in Tibet in the eighth century. Such debates usually take place within the monastery’s precincts. The defender has the onus to prove his point of view on the subject proposed for debate. The debate opens with an invocation to Manjushri recited in a loud and high pitched tone. The roles of the debater and the questioner are well defined; the questioner has to succinctly present his case (all on Buddhism related topics) and the defender has to answer within a fixed time frame. The finality of <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> with specific answers like: “I accept (do), the reason is not established (ta madrup) or there is no pervasion (Kyappa majung)”. Many a time, the questions mooted are meant to mislead the defender. If the defender does not reply within a time frame, an expression of derision is witnessed. In the Tibetan debating sessions, there is no role for a witness and there is normally no adjudicator. This leads to “conflicting opinions of participants and listeners.” When there is direct contradiction on the defenders part, the outcome is, however, formally decided.|$|E
25|$|An {{ongoing debate}} rages over whether 24 {{paintings}} and drawings found in a Wainscott locker in 2003 are Pollock originals. Physicists have argued over whether fractals {{can be used to}} authenticate the paintings. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> still inconclusive.|$|E

25|$|Having {{discussed}} Plato's philosophy, linguistics, perception, {{and some}} cognitive structures, various implications {{that arise from}} the research and theorizing can be touched on.

25|$|While Hawaii is internationally {{recognized}} as {{a state of the}} United States while also being broadly accepted as such in mainstream understanding, the legality of this status has been raised in U.S. District Court, the U.N., and other international forums.

25|$|On August 21, 1858 {{the first}} of the Lincoln-Douglas debates was held in Ottawa's Washington Park. The site of <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> marked by a large boulder affixed with a plaque. The boulder was erected on August 21, 1908 by the Daughters of the American Revolution.

25|$|The primary {{catalyst}} for secession was slavery, especially Southern political leaders' resistance to attempts by Northern antislavery political forces {{to block the}} expansion of slavery into the western territories. Another explanation for secession, and the subsequent formation of the Confederacy, was white Southern nationalism. The primary reason for the North to reject secession was to preserve the Union, a cause based on American nationalism. Most of <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> about the first question, as to why some southern states decided to secede.|$|E
25|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> mathematical, {{but some}} major {{elements}} {{can be explained}} in simple terms {{and as part of}} the 'aggregation problem'. That is, the critique of neoclassical capital theory might be summed up as saying that it suffers from the fallacy of composition, i.e., that we cannot simply jump from microeconomic conceptions to an understanding of production by society as a whole. The resolution of the debate, particularly how broad its implications are, has not been agreed upon by economists.|$|E
25|$|The Rajya Sabha (Council of states) – {{which is}} the upper house in the Indian {{bicameral}} legislature – allows for a debate {{to be brought to}} a close with a simple majority decision of the house, on a closure motion so introduced by any member. On the other hand, the Lok Sabha (Council of the people) – the lower house – leaves the closure of the debate to the discretion of the speaker, once a motion to end <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> moved by a member.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{pointed out}} that the world is not always green, and that when it is, herbivores do not {{necessarily}} {{play an important role in}} structuring plant communities (Ehrlich and Birch 1967). Others argued that what is green is not always edible or of sufficiently high quality to allow increases in herbivore populations (Dixon 1966, Murdoch 1966). <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> ongoing, but the dominant view of ecologists remains that although consumers affect many aspects of plant productivity and ecology, top-down control does not drive the productivity of entire plant ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|Despite these {{seemingly}} paradoxical facts, most mathematicians accept the {{axiom of choice}} as a valid principle for proving new results in mathematics. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> interesting enough, however, that it is considered of note when a theorem in ZFC (ZF plus AC) is logically equivalent (with just the ZF axioms) to the axiom of choice, and mathematicians look for results that require the axiom of choice to be false, though this type of deduction is less common than the type which requires the axiom of choice to be true.|$|E
25|$|Military historians {{disagree}} on the Chindits' military significance. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> part of the ongoing one of whether the deployment of special forces are a net asset to a campaign or whether the investment in time, material and men that such operations demand outweigh the advantages gained. For example, it is questioned whether the interdiction of Japanese supply lines during Operation Thursday by the Chindits contributed more to Stilwell's advance than if the resources committed to the operation {{had been used to}} provide Stilwell with another regular division to fight alongside his X Force.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> famous due to {{the fact}} that Newt Gingrich spent three minutes yelling at the {{moderator}} at the beginning of the debate after Gingrich was asked a question about whether he had been asked to enter into an open marriage. Gingrich felt that the question was an extremely unfair way to begin a presidential debate and was an attempt to protect President Barack Obama. The incident resulted in a great amount of applause for Gingrich, and was widely broadcast on YouTube. It was also credited with raising Gingrich's support in South Carolina, leading to his win in that state's primary two days later.|$|E
25|$|After the Reformation, Protestant groups {{continued}} to splinter, {{leading to a}} range of new theologies. The Enthusiasts were so named because of their emotional zeal. These included the Methodists, the Quakers, and the Baptists. Another group sought to reconcile Christian faith with modernist ideas, sometimes causing them to reject beliefs they considered to be illogical, including the Nicene creed and Chalcedonian Creed. These included Unitarians and Universalists. A major issue for Protestants became the degree to which people contribute to their salvation. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> often viewed as synergism versus monergism, though the labels Calvinist and Arminian are more frequently used, referring to the conclusion of the Synod of Dort.|$|E
25|$|Some {{objections}} to the historicity of the Guadalupe event, grounded {{in the silence of}} the very sources which – so it is argued – are those most likely to have referred to it, were raised as long ago as 1794 by Juan Bautista Muñoz and were expounded in detail by Mexican historian Joaquín García Icazbalceta in a confidential report dated 1883 commissioned by the then Archbishop of Mexico and first published in 1896. The silence of the sources is discussed in a separate section, below. The most prolific contemporary protagonist in <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>is</b> Stafford Poole, a historian and Vincentian priest in the United States of America, who questioned the integrity and rigor of the historical investigation conducted by the Catholic Church in the interval between Juan Diego's beatification and his canonization.|$|E
