5|$|In 1965, {{he stood}} <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> his elder brother's baronetcy, {{together}} with a large estate. This inheritance was challenged by his cousin, who argued that the re-registration was invalid; under this interpretation, Forbes would legally be considered a woman, and thus unable <b>to</b> <b>inherit.</b> The legal position was unclear, and it took three years before a ruling by the Court of Session was finally upheld by the Home Secretary, granting him the title. The case was held in great secrecy, with the effect that it was unable {{to be considered in}} other judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance, but has become more widely known since his death in 1991.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In order <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> it, {{both of the}} parents of an individual must carry an affected gene.

5|$|Leo had {{meanwhile}} united the Armenian Church in Cilicia with Rome {{and acknowledged}} the suzerainty of the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry VI. The emperor's envoy, Conrad of Wittelsbach, Archbishop of Mainz, was present when Leo was crowned the first king of Armenian Cilicia on 6January 1198. Before long, Conrad went to Antioch and persuaded Bohemond and his barons to swear {{an oath to}} accept Raymund-Roupen's right <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> Antioch.|$|E

In exchange, the Polish lords confirmed the right of Louis's daughters <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> Poland.|$|E

William de Wormegay {{had died in}} 1166 and Reginald was fined just over 466 pounds by the king for the right <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> his father-in-law's lands.

The centre of the honour was at Lynn, Norfolk.|$|E

Will therefore tries to push Ben and his daughter Clara (Joanne Woodward) into marriage.|$|E
5|$|The story then {{shifts to}} four years later, where Marley forces {{including}} Titan Shifters like Zeke and Reiner, as well as warriors in training <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> their powers are fighting against another nation called the Mid-East Allied Forces. Though Marley wins the war, they are devastated by the new invention of Anti-Titan artillery which can seriously harm and even kill the most well fortified Titan Shifters. Thus Zeke tells Marley military command that they must once again attempt to steal Eren's Coordinate power or Marley's position as a world hegemony will cease. As the Marleyan military prepares for another attempt to invade Paradis, Eren infiltrates the country by assuming the disguise of a wounded and amputated soldier named Mr. Kruger who uses Falco Grice, one of the prospective warriors who desire <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> the Armored Titan to gain information. The Tyburs, an influential and highly-respected political clan led by Willy who is the current holder of the War Hammer Titan, secretly control the Marley government and decide to assist the warriors for the imminent invasion of Paradis.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} hagiographies of {{previous}} Zagwe dynastic rulers composed during the Solomonic period. For instance, {{during the reign}} of Zara Yaqob (1434–1468) a chronicle focusing on Gebre Mesqel Lalibela (r. 1185–1225) portrayed him as a Christian saint who performed miracles. Conveniently for the legitimacy of the Solomonic dynasty, the chronicle stated that Lalibela did not desire for his heirs <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> his throne.|$|E

A helpless Govindayya is confronted by Viyyanna, who threatens to use his influence as {{a president of the}} panchayat to have him arrested if he does not reform himself. Govindayya begs pardon and flees with his family. The film ends with everyone present in Ramana's house, laughing maniacally.|$|E
5|$|Areas annexed by France {{during the}} Napoleonic era {{were the first}} <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> the metric system. In 1812, Napoleon {{introduced}} a system known as mesures usuelles, which used the names of pre-metric units of measure, but defined {{them in terms of}} metric units – for example, the livre metrique (metric pound) was 500g and the toise metrique (metric fathom) was 2metres. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, France lost the territories that she had annexed; some, such as the Papal States reverted to their pre-revolutionary units of measure, others such as Baden adopted {{a modified version of the}} mesures usuelles, but France kept her system of measurement intact.|$|E

5|$|Besides Ælfflæd, Siward {{is known}} to have been married to a woman named Godgifu, who died before Siward. The {{marriage}} is known from a grant she made of territory around Stamford, Lincolnshire, to Peterborough Abbey. Although no surviving children are attested, and no source states the name of Osbjorn's mother, this marriage has nonetheless raised the possibility that Waltheof and Osbjorn were born to different mothers, and William Kapelle suggested that Siward may have originally intended Osbjorn <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> his southern territories while Waltheof inherited those territories in the north associated with the family of his mother Ælfflæd.|$|E
5|$|Charles, Prince Elector and Duke of Bavaria, {{claimed the}} German territories of the Habsburg dynasty as a {{son-in-law}} of Joseph I, and furthermore presented himself as Charles VI's legitimate imperial successor. If women were going <b>to</b> <b>inherit,</b> he claimed, then his family should have precedence: his wife, Maria Amalia, {{was the daughter}} of Joseph I. Both Charles VI and his predecessor Joseph I had died without sons. Charles of Bavaria suggested that the legitimate succession pass to Joseph's female children, rather than to the daughters of the younger brother, Charles VI. For different reasons, Prussia, France, Spain and the Polish-Saxon monarchy supported Charles of Bavaria's claim to the Habsburg territory and the Imperial title and reneged on the Pragmatic Sanction.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{about his}} growing blindness, and not enjoying the social life in London, Bute retired to his estates on the Isle of Bute {{for the next}} six years. While recovering, Bute married his first wife, Lady Maria North, in 1818. Maria was one of the three daughters of the 3rd Earl of Guilford, and a wealthy heiress. £40,000 was settled on her {{at the time of her}} {{marriage}} and she was due <b>to</b> <b>inherit</b> a third of her father's extensive estates. Contemporaries considered Maria a kind and pleasant woman, but she was often unwell and the marriage proved childless. In 1820 his portrait was painted by Henry Raeburn, and published two years later as an engraving by William Ward. In 1827 his father-in-law died and Maria inherited lands worth over £110,000.|$|E
40|$|Rickets is an {{important}} problem even in countries with adequate sun exposure. The causes of rickets/osteomalacia are varied and include nutritional deficiency, especially poor dietary intake of vitamin D and calcium. Non-nutritional causes include hypophosphatemic rickets primarily due to renal phosphate losses and rickets due to renal tubular acidosis. In addition, some varieties are due <b>to</b> <b>inherited</b> defects in vitamin D metabolism and are called vitamin D dependent rickets. This chapter highlights rickets/osteomalacia related to vitamin D deficiency or <b>to</b> <b>inherited</b> defects in vitamin D metabolism. Hypophosphatemic rickets and rickets due to renal tubular acidosis are discussed in other sections of the journal...|$|R
