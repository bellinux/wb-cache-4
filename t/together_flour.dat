ArthurKun Yan ZhuExperiments were {{conducted}} to assess the effects of direct and indirect exposure scenarios, different degrees of residual flour, open and obstructed positions, and seasonal temperature variations on the efficacy of synergized pyrethrin against the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) and the confused flour beetle, Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val. To evaluate effects of direct and indirect exposures of T. castaneum and T. confusum eggs, larvae, pupae, or eggs to the insecticide aerosol within a flour mill, the following treatments were made to each life stage: insects treated with aerosol and transferred to treated or untreated flour, untreated insects transferred to treated flour, and insects and flour combined and treated together. Different degrees of harborage or sanitation levels were created by exposing T. confusum larvae, pupae, and adults to pyrethrin aerosol in Petri dishes containing 0, 0. 1, 1, 5, and 10 g of wheat flour. Effects of pyrethrin dispersal in open and obstructed positions and seasonal temperature variations were assessed by exposing T. confusum pupae and adults in open positions and inside wooden boxes (1 m long, 20 cm wide, and 5, 10, or 20 cm high) inside experimental sheds maintained at target temperatures of 22, 27, and 32 °C. Results showed that when T. castaneum and T. confusum were directly exposed to aerosol without the flour source, or with a low amount of flour at open exposed areas, the aerosol provided good control against all life stages of T. castaneum and T. confusum. However, when insects were indirectly exposed (treated <b>together</b> with <b>flour</b> or untreated insects were transferred to treated <b>flour),</b> or treated <b>together</b> with deeper <b>flour</b> amounts, and exposed inside the boxes, the efficacy was greatly reduced.

We compared growth of yeast and bacteria strains when cultivated alone or <b>together</b> in wheat <b>flour</b> filtrate or wheat dough. The analysis of co-occurrence revealed that Kazachstania humilis and Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis co-occurred more often than expected by chance while Wickeranomyces anomalus and L. sanfranciscensis co-occurred less often. We tested whether K. humilis and L. sanfranciscensis were in positive interaction but also studied other yeast/bacteria species that can be found in sourdough. We found that the effect of the yeast-LAB interaction depends on the strains rather than the species. Globally, the response was asymmetric. Yeasts facilitated the growth of bacteria in several cases, but the opposite was not found. The nature of interaction differed in liquid wheat flour filtrate and dough, showing an environment effect.

High temperature cementing {{is one of the}} problems. High temperature cementing may cover steam recovery wells, geothermal wells and ultra deep wells. The use of expanding cements as an effort to improve the sealing efficacy of annulus cementing has been considered for a long time as a promising solution to the existing problems. CaO and MgO have been proposed as two of the most effective additives to create excellent expanding cement. The purpose of this study is to find the effect of adding up burnt pure CaO and MgO to the value of compressive strength and shear bond strength of API class G cement in high pressure and high temperature condition. The method that we used within this research is an evaluation of the data taken from a simulator that simulated within temperature range of 100 – 250 oC and pressure of 2000 psi. The conclusion is taken according to the results which saying that the addition of burnt pure CaO and MgO would increase the shear bond strength and the compressive strength on specific condition up to 200 oC temperature. The addition won’t be effective for the condition of 250 oC temperature. The behavior of cement strength was also influenced by the length of curing time. Further more, research on expanding cement needs to be developed and extended whether to vary its compositions, temperatures, or curing time conditions.

40|$|Abstract In a {{previous}} study, {{we have shown}} that water unextractable solids (WUS) interfere with gluten formation and {{affect the quality of}} the resulting gluten. In this study we aim to explain how WUS can affect the process of gluten formation. To this end, WUS were modified with NaOH, xylanase, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Effects of modified WUS on gluten yield, dough properties, and gluten and glutenin macropolymer (GMP) composition and properties were studied. The results showed that addition of WUS to wheat flour led to a lower gluten yield and gluten starch yield, a higher Rmax and a lower E at Rmax of gluten and a more concentrated and elastic GMP gel. Pretreatment of WUS by NaOH, xylanase, HRP and H 2 O 2 cannot correct its negative effect on gluten yield, but addition of xylanase or free ferulic acid (FA) during gluten separation can remove or prevent the negative effect of WUS on gluten yield. Compared to addition of only WUS, addition of WUS and FA <b>together</b> to wheat <b>flour</b> resulted in a higher gluten yield, a higher E at Rmax of gluten, and a less concentrated and elastic GMP gel. Similar to water extractable pentosans (WEP), FA bound WUS {{plays a key role in}} the effect of WUS on gluten yield and properties. It appears that there is a common mechanism regarding the effect of WUS and WEP that the oxidative cross-linking during gluten formation could be prevented by FA addition.

40|$|Presented at the GLOBELICS 6 th International Conference 2008 22 - 24 September, Mexico City, Mexico. It is {{difficult}} to find a field of macroeconomics in which experts can disregard Argentina. Researchers that focus on economic growth have compared Argentina with Japan or Australia, concluding that the former had experienced many “lost opportunities”. Researchers that focus on inflation dynamics try to explain how an economy can go from hyperinflation to deflation in just a few years. Researchers exploring international finance and emerging economies wonder whether Argentina played a Ponzi game with its external debt during the late 1990 s. Researchers studying business cycles have tried to understand the determinants of excess aggregate volatility and the occurrence of crises episodes. And on it goes. As we can see, the set of “macroeconomic facts” for Argentina has few positive elements. Albrieu and Fanelli (2008) and Chisari et al. (2008) elaborated growth diagnostics for Argentina in line with Hausmann et al. (2005) methodology, and they detected that the main binding constraint on economic growth is the low appropriability of the returns on economic activity. The idea is simple. Imagine an economy that is subject to external (and policy-induced) shocks and an especially low ability to process them without generating important economic costs and, in some cases, dramatic regime switching. Given this context, investment decisions in physical capital and innovative activities are rather defensive. So, the investment rate is low, especially in those areas where profits are more uncertain, such as Research and Development (R&D). As a result, the average productivity level of the economy is lower than that reported in the developed world. From a macroeconomic perspective, the stylized fact that arises is a divergence in long run growth (cf. Pritchett, 1997). Nevertheless, since the mid- 1990 s one sector of the economy has gone in the opposite direction. We refer to the Soybean Production Chain (SPC). Between 1996 and 2007, the primary production of oilseeds grew from 12 million tons to 48 million, whereas SPC exports increased from 11 million tons to 46 million. Hence, Argentina was transformed into the leading exporter of oilseeds and soybean <b>flour,</b> <b>together</b> with being the main worldwide pool of oilseed production in the environs of Rosario, Santa Fe. In sum, SPC registers high rates of growth, is fully integrated with international markets, displays a differentiated pattern of innovative activities, and has developed a complex structure of contracts that {{it is very difficult to}} see in the rest of the economy. In this paper we take neither a purely macroeconomic nor a purely microeconomic approach, but a mix of the two. More precisely, we consider that a decentralized decision of the economic unit regarding investment and technological change (that is, the microeconomics) is determined simultaneously with the characteristics and the performance of the aggregate economy (the macroeconomics). To this end we need to detect whether causation runs in both directions: (a) from macroeconomics to microeconomics, we will take into account that macroeconomic shocks are decisive to defining the (micro) economic structure; (b) from microeconomics to macroeconomics, we will analyze how the economic structure and the institutional arrangements implemented (such as, contingent contracts) affect the ability of the economy to process shocks, taking advantage of the positive ones and filtering out the negative ones. The present study on the interactions between the microeconomy and the macroeconomy recognizes – and is inspired by – several studies on economic development in Argentina. In particular, the studies of Fanelli and Frenkel (1994 and 2000), Katz (1996) and Kosacoff (2008) have conducted exercises that are similar in spirit to ours. By contrast, the most important difference between these papers and ours is the sector of the economy chosen to represent “the microeconomy”: while we study a branch of the agricultural sector, they analyze the dynamics of the industrial sector. The difference is important because of the diverging paths these two sectors take. In the above papers the authors explained how the uncertain macroeconomic environment makes profitable a specific kind of adaptative behavior that generates a premium on the more flexible or reversible options. Simultaneously, this (directly unobservable) defensive behavior has its observable counterpart in a pattern of low investment in physical capital and R&D, with the corresponding negative effects on economic growth. As we wrote above, this is not the case for the SPC. Therefore, we have to determine new linkages between microeconomics and macroeconomics. The work is organized as follows. Section II studies the changes in the environment (or the “macroeconomics) of the individual agent that is part of the SPC and makes decisions regarding investment and innovation. We will see the role played by world markets as well as economic policies. That is, we will study how the aggregative conditions influence the individual decision and in so doing, influence the configuration of the economic structure. Section III describes the microeconomic decisions taken by these agents. We will explain SPC’s strategies for investment in innovation as the (best) response to the perceived changes in the environment detected in Section II. Section IV studies how the resulting economic structure of those microeconomic, decentralized decisions affects the macroeconomic performance. Finally, Section V concludes...|$|R
