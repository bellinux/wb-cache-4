The OLPC XO-3 can operate with 2 watts of electricity because its renewable energy resources generate a total of 4 watts.

Dr. Wessen {{has been an}} employee of the California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory since 1984. He is currently the A-Team Lead Study Architect for JPL's Innovation Foundry. On the side, Wessen works with Dr. David Porter of Chapman University in the field of Experimental Economics, where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>designing</b> a system to help allocate resources for building instruments on robotic deep space planetary spacecraft. This proposed system will build on the success of the Cassini Resource Exchange and be applied to NASA's Outer Planet Flagship Missions.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} is built {{to a traditional}} high-density urban pattern, rather than a suburban one, focused on creating an integrated community of shops, businesses, and private and social housing. There is no zoning. The planners say <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>designing</b> the development around people rather than the car, and they aim to provide a high-quality environment, from the architecture to the selection of materials, to the signposts, and the landscaping. To avoid constant construction, utilities are buried in common utility ducts under the town. Common areas are maintained by a management company to which all residents belong. It consists of 40% social housing and is designed for sustainable development, which includes being carbon-neutral.|$|E
50|$|Marketing and {{communication}} design on a website may identify {{what works for}} its target market. This can be an age group or particular strand of culture; thus the designer may understand the trends of its audience. Designers may also understand the type of website <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>designing,</b> meaning, for example, that (B2B) business-to-business website design considerations might differ greatly from a consumer targeted website such as a retail or entertainment website. Careful consideration might be made {{to ensure that the}} aesthetics or overall design of a site do not clash with the clarity and accuracy of the content or the ease of web navigation, especially on a B2B website. Designers may also consider the reputation of the owner or business the site is representing {{to make sure they are}} portrayed favourably.|$|E
