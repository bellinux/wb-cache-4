5|$|Both {{videos were}} shot {{as a set}} and cost £500,000 to make. The videos took four months of {{production}} before release. The girls chose to perform their own stunts in <b>the</b> <b>video,</b> <b>and</b> at one point Natalie Appleton was knocked over by an explosion, although she remained unhurt.|$|E

30|$|Based in a {{procedure}} developed by Allen et al., (2007), the Script for Nominal Groups with Multiple Actors was elaborated, comprised of guide items which addressed the used videos’ and activities’ cultural adequacy accordingly to the situation, approaches, language, examples, narration, and scenarios. These included (a) aspects of <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> <b>and</b> activities <b>the</b> closest and most relevant to and those most distant and different from Brazilian culture, (b) most and least appealing aspects of <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> <b>and</b> program activities, and (c) aspects {{that must be}} kept and that must be changed in the adaptation of <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> <b>and</b> activities {{as well as in}} the working of the program (for instance, the length and number of facilitators).|$|R

5|$|Although {{they fail}} to win the competition, a YouTube video of their {{performance}} gains the band popularity at school. David Bowie (portraying himself) sees <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>and</b> sends an e-mail to Will, explaining that he is starting an indie music label and is interested in having the band {{as one of their}} first artists. Will is so excited and overwhelmed that he falls {{down in the middle of}} the school hallway (close to the same position as the front cover of Bowie's Lodger album). The last scene takes place during Charlotte's graduation ceremony where Will and Sa5m are confirmed as dating.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was shot in}} Italy, and directed by Tom Munro. It shows Madonna escaping the paparazzi {{on the back of}} a convertible. She travels throughout the city and the Italian countryside, while picking up men from the roadside and having a party on the car. The video received general acclaim from critics, who commended the simplicity of <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>and</b> labeled it as Madonna's most fun video in years. The song was included on the setlist of The MDNA Tour where she performed it while playing a guitar.|$|E
5|$|Analysts said that, {{in return}} for {{organizational}} support, al-Balawi probably agreed to appear in <b>the</b> <b>video,</b> <b>and</b> to connect the attack {{he was planning to}} the death of Baitullah Mehsud, thus raising the profile of the Tehrik-i-Taliban. Most analysts believe, however, that al Qaeda chose the CIA as the target and ran the operation.|$|E
30|$|The {{experiment}} {{employed a}} 2 [*]×[*] 2 [*]×[*] 2 mixed design. The scale range (two levels vs four levels) and the scale type (verbal-only vs verbal + numeric) were manipulated between-subjects, whereas the lineup type (TP vs TA) was manipulated within-subjects. Individuals viewed two <b>videos</b> <b>and</b> were later tested with a TP lineup {{for one of}} <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> <b>and</b> a TA lineup for the other. The order of <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lineups were counterbalanced. Thus, every 16 participants constituted a complete experimental counterbalancing.|$|R

5|$|Both series {{have been}} {{released}} on DVD. The DVD is notable because {{a fan of the}} show, Craig Robins, bought the rights from 2Entertain, BBC Worldwide's DVD interest, and released it on his own independent label, Replay DVD. Robins put up £30,000 of his own money to buy the rights and produced the series one disc. As a professional videotape editor, Robins was able to restore <b>the</b> <b>video,</b> <b>and</b> author the disc himself, using a piece of freeware to transcribe the dialogue for the subtitles.|$|E
5|$|Messages, many in {{commonly}} used ciphers and encryption systems, {{have been found}} hidden in <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>and</b> its sound spectrogram, as well as images of tortured and mutilated people. Most of the messages have been decoded by participants in an ongoing Reddit thread, and the images sourced to notable murder investigations such as the Boston Strangler. They have been interpreted as implying a threat of bioterrorism against the United States, although {{it has also been}} speculated that the video is in reality a prank, a viral marketing stunt for an upcoming film or video game, or a student film.|$|E
5|$|Protests erupted {{soon after}} the release of <b>the</b> <b>video,</b> <b>and</b> on Black Friday protesters shut down part of the city's Magnificent Mile. Public calls for {{resignation}} grew steadily over this period, including a well-circulated op-ed published in The New York Times. By early December, Emanuel's approval rating had sunk to 18%, with 67% of Chicagoans disapproving of his job performance and slightly more than half of those polled calling for his resignation. During the week of December 10, protestors blocked streets and continued to call for Emanuel to resign. Additional protests against Emanuel and Chicago's Police Department were held on the city's busy Michigan Avenue shopping area on December 24, 2015.|$|E

40|$|These eight videos depict {{clinical}} {{interactions between}} {{health care providers}} and Spanish-speaking patients. They are designed as both a Spanish language practice tool and as case studies for discussion of critical issues and cultural nuances that can arise in a clinical setting. Dialogue is all in Spanish; patients are all portrayed by native speakers, and health care providers by native speakers and actors with {{a broad range of}} Spanish proficiency. <b>The</b> <b>videos</b> range from about 1 minute to 3. 5 minutes in length, and for each scenario there is also a version with English subtitles. ¶ Suggested Uses of the Videos: ¶ Watch <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> <b>and</b> post <b>the</b> responses to questions on Voice Threads™ in Spanish ¶ Watch <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> <b>and</b> engage in discussions on blogs or small groups related to content ¶ Watch <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> <b>and</b> have <b>the</b> learners develop care plans or education plans ¶ Use <b>the</b> <b>videos</b> as part of simulation experiences or replacement for clinical hour...|$|R

5|$|Sue is {{laughed at}} by her co-workers, {{who have seen}} <b>the</b> <b>video,</b> <b>and</b> is mocked by new {{alcoholic}} astronomy teacher and badminton coach Brenda Castle (Molly Shannon). Sue is reminded by her sister, Jean (Robin Trocki), who has Down Syndrome, that when they were hurt as children they would volunteer at an animal shelter as a reminder there was always someone less fortunate than themselves. In light of her sister's advice, Sue decides {{to act as a}} therapist to guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), informing her that Will has been unfaithful to her. Emma confronts Will in the teachers' lounge, publicly shaming him.|$|E

5|$|The {{track was}} {{released}} as {{the seventh and}} final single from Watch the Throne. The song peaked at number 72 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and entered the top 40 on both the US Billboard Hot Rap Songs and Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs charts. The song received a music video directed by Romain Gavras released on May 29, 2012. The video does not feature any of the performers featured on the song and instead features anarchic riot footage and large street fights. The video received positive reviews from critics who praised the visuals of <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>and</b> the unique aesthetic presented in the video.|$|E
5|$|In the song's music video, Trainor sings into a red {{microphone}} {{in front of}} a pastel blue wall. She is sometimes flanked by backup dancers and television screens. Lips are used as a motif throughout the video; they appear as closeups of Trainor's mouth and as a large drawing of lips used as a backdrop. Yahoo! Music writer Lyndsey Parker compared the video to the poster for The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Trainor wears lip-shaped earrings and sunglasses in <b>the</b> <b>video,</b> <b>and</b> is seen reclining on a lip-shaped sofa. Parker compared the sofa in the video to the sofas used in the American television program So You Think You Can Dance. The video's set changes constantly; props are lifted on-and-off screen by workers throughout the clip.|$|E
5|$|Royce begins rapping in {{a prison}} cell, until he finds a poster and peels it off the wall to find a door compartment, a {{reference}} to 1994 drama film The Shawshank Redemption. He crawls through it and finds himself in the tunnel. Royce lights a flare to help navigate through the system. As Mars sings the bridge, the two rappers find {{their way out of}} the tunnels, through a manhole which leads them to a field where Mars sings. As the sun starts to set, couples, along with Bad Meets Evil, gather to see a large group of rising sky lanterns aglow. Beats by Dr. Dre headphones are advertised in <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>and</b> one couple gathers in front of a Chrysler 300. As the video reaches its conclusion, the setting gets dark and Mars sings the last lines.|$|E

5|$|The British {{television}} {{premiere of}} the video was extremely controversial. The video had not been ready when the track debuted in the UK singles chart. By {{the time it was}} finalised, the track had dropped in the chart. McCartney flew to London to premiere the video on the BBC1 TV show Top Of The Pops, but the show had a strict policy that no single that had dropped in position could feature on the programme and refused to show it. A furious argument ensued, with claims McCartney threatened to withdraw all his music from the corporation. As a compromise, the BBC offered to air the video two days later on The Late, Late Breakfast Show hosted by Noel Edmonds, a variety show that featured live music performances, but rarely aired videos. They agreed to show it on the programme only if McCartney appeared live and gave an interview. He reluctantly agreed and appeared with his wife Linda live on the show on Saturday, 29 October 1983; his first live UK TV appearance since 1973. The interview was stilted and the McCartneys made little or no effort to answer any of Edmonds' questions. After some reportedly hostile negotiations, the programme's entire show was built around the 'medicine men' theme of <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>and</b> the guest who had been booked to appear that week Olivia Newton John had to agree to appear to promote the video in a skit, reportedly against her will and she expressed anger at having her 'starring' role in the show downgraded into a lesser guest spot to make way for <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>and</b> McCartney. The airing of the video on this highly rated show was successful as the track climbed back up the chart the following week and aired on Top Of The Pops on Thursday, 4 November 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening scene}} begins with {{panoramic}} camera shots {{of a helicopter}} flying over Los Angeles, at night. Then during Rick Ross's verse the female {{members of the group}} appear posing in the background while Ross raps for the camera. Swizz Beatz and Rico Love make cameos alongside Ross. In a third scene, Diddy can be seen driving through the city at night in a black Bugatti Veyron. For the song's chorus, Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper take the lead, ordering drinks in a bar and enjoying the night club. A fourth scene for T.I.'s verse sees the camera focus on T.I. serenading two women in an apartment. Throughout the video the images flicker between the various scenes. In the final part of <b>the</b> <b>video,</b> <b>and</b> during the bridge, all three members of the group appear outside against a backdrop of thick smoke and bright red fireworks. There is a final flash of fireworks before the camera fades completely, to black.|$|E
5|$|When he tweeted a Christmas Eve 2012 {{video of}} himself making 45 of 50 three point shots, Dick Vitale replied 14 minutes later. On April 24, 2013, he posted {{a video of}} himself making 70 of 76 three {{pointers}} in five minutes, and 8 hours later, Stephen Curry challenged him, via Twitter, to a three-point shooting contest. Curry had set the National Basketball Association single-season three pointers made record one week earlier. The following morning ESPN retweeted <b>the</b> <b>video</b> <b>and</b> noted that Stauskas made 46 in a row. A few hours later, when Stauskas woke up, {{he said he would}} look forward to such a contest. Soon Stauskas and Curry's representatives arranged to have a showdown televised on TSN, but the contest would have been in violation of NCAA rules against competition between amateur athletes and professional athletes.|$|E
