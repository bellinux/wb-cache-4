5|$|Apart from Islam and Christianity, Periyar {{also found}} in Buddhism a basis for his {{philosophy}} {{though he did not}} accept that religion. It was again an alternative in the search for self-respect and the object was to get liberation from <b>the</b> <b>discrimination</b> of Hinduism. Through Periyar's movement Temple Entry Acts of 1924, 1931, and up to 1950 were created for the non-Brahmins. Another accomplishment took place during the 1970s when Tamil replaced Sanskrit as the Temple language in Tamil Nadu, while Dalits were finally eligible for priesthood.|$|E

30|$|In Experiment 1, we {{investigated}} the processes underlying {{the cognitive and}} algorithmic presentation of two related stimuli, those used for pointing discrimination and those used for facing discrimination. Examples of each sensor image and the combined algorithmic image are shown in Fig. 2 for <b>the</b> pointing <b>discrimination</b> and Fig. 3 for <b>the</b> facing <b>discrimination.</b> We predicted that <b>the</b> facing <b>discrimination</b> stimuli would be more difficult than <b>the</b> pointing <b>discrimination</b> for two reasons: (1) the actor is always located {{in the center of}} the image for the pointing condition but in the facing condition the location of the actor varies across trials and (2) the signal in <b>the</b> pointing <b>discrimination</b> stimuli (i.e., entire arm pointing left/right) is more salient than the signal in <b>the</b> facing <b>discrimination</b> stimuli (i.e., contours of the front versus back of the body). This prediction was supported by our findings.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> Sex <b>Discrimination</b> (Election Candidates) Act 2002 (c.2) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

40|$|A {{procedure}} developed earlier (Terrace, 1963) successfully trained a red-green <b>discrimination</b> without <b>the</b> {{occurrence of}} any errors in 12 out of 12 cases. Errorless transfer from <b>the</b> red-green <b>discrimination</b> to a discrimination between a vertical and a horizontal line {{was accomplished by}} first superimposing the vertical and the horizontal lines on the red and green backgrounds, respectively, and then fading out the red and the green backgrounds. Superimposition of {{the two sets of}} stimuli without fading, or an abrupt transfer from the first to the second set of stimuli, resulted in the occurrence of errors during transfer. Superimposition, however, did result in some “incidental learning”. Performance following acquisition of <b>the</b> vertical-horizontal <b>discrimination</b> with errors differed from performance following acquisition without errors. If <b>the</b> vertical-horizontal <b>discrimination</b> was learned with errors, the latency of the response to S+ was permanently shortened and errors occurred during subsequent testing on <b>the</b> red-green <b>discrimination</b> even though <b>the</b> red-green <b>discrimination</b> was originally acquired without errors. If <b>the</b> vertical-horizontal <b>discrimination</b> was learned without errors, the latency of the response to S+ was unaffected and no errors occurred during subsequent testing on <b>the</b> red-green <b>discrimination...</b>|$|R
5|$|Data {{from the}} ZDR was {{passed to the}} All-Target Processor (ATP), which ran initial {{processing}} on as many as 625 objects in a cloud. As many as 50 of these could be picked out for further processing in <b>the</b> <b>Discrimination</b> and Control Computer (DCC), which ran more tests on those tracks and assigned each one a probability of being the warhead or decoy. The DCC was able to run 100 different tests. For exoatmospheric signals the tests included measure of radar return pulse-to-pulse to look for tumbling objects, as well as variations in signals strength due to changes in frequency. Within the atmosphere, the primary method was examining the velocities of the objects to determine their mass.|$|E
5|$|Following Nixon, the Democratic Party's state {{convention}} {{instituted a}} rule that only whites could vote in its primary elections; the Court unanimously upheld this rule as constitutional in Grovey v. Townsend (1935), distinguishing <b>the</b> <b>discrimination</b> by a private organization {{from that of the}} state in the previous primary cases. However, in United States v. Classic (1941), the Court ruled that primary elections were {{an essential part of the}} electoral process, undermining the reasoning in Grovey. Based on Classic, the Court in Smith v. Allwright (1944), overruled Grovey, ruling that denying non-white voters a ballot in primary elections was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. In the last of the Texas primary cases, Terry v. Adams (1953), the Court ruled that black plaintiffs were entitled to damages from a group that organized whites-only pre-primary elections with the assistance of Democratic party officials.|$|E

5|$|The {{peace was}} short lived, however, as in August 1970, eight black {{players on the}} Syracuse Orange {{football}} team {{did not show up}} for preseason practice, citing systemic racism in the program and discrimination by coach Ben Schwartzwalder. The move was a continuation of a boycott of spring practice by the players, and they were automatically suspended as a result. A university report released in December of that year declared that there was a chronic problem of racism in the Syracuse athletics programs, though in some cases <b>the</b> <b>discrimination</b> was unintentional. In response, Corbally reinstated the players and approved the creation of the Athletic Policy Board to oversee athletics at the school. The board would include input from students and ensure that all students, regardless of race, were entitled to fair treatment.|$|E

5|$|Aside from {{measures}} in Vietnam, 2,000 Indochinese soldiers returning from service in France were sent on indefinite leave {{and were not}} replaced with new recruits from Vietnam. The reason is put down by historians {{to be due to}} the fact that military discipline in France was less regimented than in Indochina and other colonial garrisons. In colonial units, the colonial military and social order with Frenchmen above their colonised troops was more easily reproduced. Metropolitan officers also treated their Vietnamese subordinates on a more equitable basis, making the Vietnamese less likely to accept <b>the</b> <b>discrimination</b> upon return to Vietnam. Overseas Vietnamese soldiers could become so alienated with their experiences that they became soft targets for communist propaganda. Upon returning home, they attempted to indoctrinate other troops with their Marxist doctrine. This train of thought further reinforced French perception that subversive ideas came from the outside rather than domestically: of the 57 soldiers involved in the mutiny, 17 had served abroad. On the other hand, according to the Thiry report, the proportion of soldiers with foreign service at Yen Bay did not exceed that in other garrisons, so this was not abnormal.|$|E

5|$|Chastain is a feminist, and {{has often}} spoken against <b>the</b> <b>discrimination</b> faced {{by women and}} {{minorities}} in Hollywood. She wrote an opinion column on gender imbalance in the industry for a December 2015 issue of The Hollywood Reporter. At the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where she served as a jury member, Chastain bemoaned the passive portrayal of women in most films. She has complained about a lack of female film critics, which she believes hinders a gender-neutral perspective on film. Among other issues, she is vocal in her support for equal pay in the workplace, and has rejected offers of work that she thought were unfair. In 2013, Chastain lent her support to the Got Your 6 campaign, to help empower veterans of the United States Army, and in 2016, she became an advisory-board member to the organization We Do It Together, which produces films and television shows to promote the empowerment of women. Chastain has campaigned for access to affordable reproductive health care for women, and in 2017, Variety honored her for her work with Planned Parenthood.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} {{factions of}} the sejm were divided between liberals, supporting the German constitutional movement, and conservatives, like Edward Raczyński, who predicted that this movement would abolish the Grand Duchy's autonomy. During {{the two or}} so decades of its existence, the major issues of concern of the Sejm were the abolition of serfdom and relations between the inhabitants of Polish and German ethnicity, particularly <b>the</b> <b>discrimination</b> against the Poles by the Prussian government, which increasingly excluded the Polish majority from administration and judiciary. The last petition issued by the Sejm in 1841 demanded equal rights for the Poles and stopping of the Germanization campaign. As most of the Sejm petitions were simply ignored by the King of Prussia, this contributed to dissent in the province, which eventually resulted in an uprising in 1848 {{in the midst of}} the revolutions of 1848 in the German states. The Sejm met the total of seven times before the revolutions of 1848 (in 1827, 1830, 1834, 1837, 1841, 1843 and 1845). Following the revolutions, the Sejm of the Grand Duchy, like other provincial Prussian assemblies, gained the right to elect deputies to the Prussian Parliament. The Sejm continued its sessions till 1918, with a total of 49 Sejms being held.|$|E
