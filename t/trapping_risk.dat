40|$|High {{downside}} risk to income and livelihoods {{is part of}} life in developing countries. Climatic risks, economic fluctuations, {{and a large number}} of individual-specific shocks leave these households vulnerable to severe hardship. The paper explores the links between risk, vulnerability and poverty, taking a micro-level perspective. Risk does not just result in variability in living standards. There is increasing evidence that the lack of means to cope with risk and vulnerability is in itself a cause of persistent poverty and poverty <b>traps.</b> <b>Risk</b> results in strategies that avoid taking advantage of profitable but risky opportunities. Shocks destroy human, physical and social capital limiting opportunities further. The result is that risk is an important constraint on broad-based growth in living standards in many developing countries. It is a relatively ignored part when designing anti-poverty policies and efforts to attain the Millennium Development Goals.

40|$|The {{path to a}} {{permanent}} contract often implies a sequence of temporary jobs, multi-firms experiences and unemployment spells. This paper investigates whether {{the characteristics of the}} path may influence the chances to get {{a permanent}} contract and the duration itself at the nonpermanent state. We estimate a simple hazard model with unobserved heterogeneity to examine the average duration at the non-permanent position needed to get a permanent one, either in the same or in other firm. The analysis considers two different groups of workers specially affected by temporary contracts. These are the young workers who just enter into the labor market, and the long term unemployed. We find evidence of the existence of the temporality trap. The probability of accessing into a permanent contract is non linearly related to the duration at the non-permanent state. It starts increasing but once it reaches a maximum it drops to pretty low levels. Besides, repeated temporary contracts and job interruptions reduce it while multi-firm experiences seem do not affect it negatively.

40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Microinsurance {{services}} have been operating in Ghana {{for the last}} decade, but the question whether they have enhanced the welfare of low-income households, mostly in the informal sector, is largely unresearched. In particular the study asks: does microinsurance improve the welfare of households through asset retention, consumption smoothing and inequality reduction? This question has been examined {{through the use of}} the 2010 FINSCOPE survey which contains in-depth information on 3 642 households across the rural and urban settings of the country. In order to control for selection bias and endogeneity bias, Heckman sample selection, instrumental variable and treatment effect models were employed for the evaluation. The results of the assessment have been compiled into four empirical essays. The first essay investigates the impact of microinsurance on household asset accumulation. The findings show that microinsurance has a positive welfare impact in terms of household asset accumulation. This suggests that microinsurance prevents asset pawning and liquidation of essential household assets at ‘give away’ prices. By absorbing the risk of low-income households, insurance equips them to cope effectively with risk, empowers them to escape poverty and sustains the welfare gains achieved. The second essay examines the impact of microinsurance on consumption smoothing. It delves into the capacity of microinsurance to enable households to avoid costly risk-coping methods which are detrimental to health and well-being. The results reveal that insured households are less likely to reduce the daily intake of meals, which is an indication that microinsurance is a better option for managing consumption smoothing among low-income households. The third essay investigates the effect of microinsurance on households’ asset inequality. The findings indicate that the asset inequality of insured households is less than that of uninsured households. Insured female-headed households have much lower asset inequality than male-headed households, but uninsured female-headed households are worse off than both uninsured and insured male-headed households. The regional trend reveals that developmental gaps impede the capacity of microinsurance to bridge the asset inequality gap. The fourth essay asks: Does microcredit improve the well-being of low-income households in the absence of microinsurance? The findings show a weak influence of microcredit on household welfare. However households using microcredit in combination with microinsurance derive significant gains in terms of welfare improvement. Microcredit may be good, but its real benefits to the poor is best realised if the poverty <b>trapping</b> <b>risks</b> are covered with microinsurance. To this extent, combining microcredit with microinsurance will empower the poor to make a sustainable exit from poverty. The findings of this thesis have pertinent policy implications for the government, the development community and stakeholders in the insurance industry. Microinsurance is a good instrument for improving the welfare of households and thus this research recommends its integration into the poverty reduction strategy of Ghana and a greater insurance inclusion for {{the lower end of the}} market...|$|R

A comparative risk assessment {{was performed on}} three commercial flame retardant materials with regard to relative hazards associated with acidic combustion gases to skin during a full engulfment flash fire event. The tests were performed in accordance with ASTM F 1930 and ISO 13506 : Standard Test Method for Evaluation of Flame Resistant Clothing for Protection against Fire Simulations Using an Instrumented Manikin. Three fire retardant textiles were tested: an FR treated cotton/nylon blend, a low Protex® modacrylic blend, and a medium Protex® modacrylic blend. The materials, {{in the form of}} whole body coveralls, were subjected to propane-fired flash conditions of 84 kW/m 2 in a full sized simulator for a duration of either 3 or 4 s. Ion traps consisting of wetted sodium carbonate-impregnated cellulose in Teflon holders were placed on the chest and back both above and under the standard undergarments. The ion traps remained in position from the time of ignition until 5 min post ignition. Results indicated that acid deposition did increase with modacrylic content from 0. 9 μmol/cm 2 for the cotton/nylon, to 12 μmol/cm 2 for the medium modacrylic blend. The source of the acidity was dominated by hydrogen chloride. Discoloration was inversely proportional to the amount of acid collected on the <b>traps.</b> A <b>risk</b> assessment was performed on the potential adverse impact of acid gases on both the skin and open wounds.

Separate investigations of single processes only {{might lead to a}} misjudgement of the general natural risks for this areas. To avoid this <b>trap,</b> natural <b>risk</b> assessments should not focus on a singular process but on multiple processes. Within this study a general methodology is developed to analyse natural risk for multiple processes. The method is applied in Bíldudalur, NW-Iceland. In particular snow avalanches, rock falls and debris flows pose a hazard to the village of 300 inhabitants. The natural risk calculation is a function based on the input parameters hazard, vulnerability, probability of the spatial impact, probability of the temporal impact, probability of the seasonal occurrence and damage potential. First, the risk posed by each process is calculated. Results are presented as individual risk and object risk to life, and as economic risk for each process. Finally, single process risk maps are combined to multi hazard risk maps. In the study area the highest risks throughout all of the analyses (individual risk to life, object risk to life and economic risk) are caused by debris flows, followed by snow avalanches and rock falls. It is demonstrated, that risk varies heavily depending on the process considered. The total risk to life caused by snow avalanches, debris flows, rock fall and multi-hazards is 0. 19, 0. 63, 0. 009 and 0. 83 deaths per year, respectively. Multi-hazard approaches are not only valuable to get an overview on the overall risk but have also a high significance for planning effective countermeasures. It can be concluded that the newly developed method is applicable to other natural processes as well as to further catchments in Iceland as well as in other countries with different environmental settings...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} on {{economic growth and}} development has focused considerable attention on questions of risk management {{and the possibility of}} multiple equilibria associated with poverty traps. We use herd history data collected among pastoralists in southern Ethiopia to study stochastic wealth dynamics among a very poor population. These data yield several novel findings. Although covariate rainfall shocks plainly matter, household-specific factors, including own herd size, account for most observed variability in wealth dynamics. Despite longstanding conventional wisdom about common property grazing lands, we find no statistical support for the tragedy of the commons hypothesis. It appears that past studies may have conflated costly self-insurance with stocking rate externalities. Such self-insurance is important in this setting because weak livestock markets and meager social insurance cause wealth to fluctuate largely in response to biophysical shocks. These shocks move households between multiple dynamic wealth equilibria toward which households converge following nonconvex path dynamics. The lowest equilibrium is consistent with the notion of a poverty trap.

Hence, it is very important for every building to practice fire drill, especially high-rise building. Referring to Fire and Rescue Department of Malaysia(BOMBA), high-rise building had a higher risk compared to other type of buildings. However, there might be problems arise to practice fire drill especially in high-rise building. This research intends to study on fire drill procedure and identify any possible common problems arises when practicing fire drill in high-rise building in Kuala Lumpur. Information was gained through regulations and guidelines associated with fire drill procedure and also parties involved in the practice. Besides, a survey is done for awareness of occupants in high-rise building on fire drill practice. For the case study, three high-rise building are selected in Kuala Lumpur based on specific criteria. Analysis for this research comprises of comparative and descriptive approach as well as statistical analysis which are documented based on case studies and questionnaire survey. The findings indicates that there is no standardized procedure in fire drill, while the most common problems that can be seen in practicing fire drill are lack of commitment among occupants, lack of information on fire drill and output on weaknesses after fire drill been practiced...|$|R
40|$|Monetary {{policy can}} achieve average {{inflation}} equal {{to a given}} inflation target and, at best, a good compromise between inflation variability and output-gap variability. Monetary policy cannot completely stabilize either inflation or the output gap. Increased credibility {{in the form of}} inflation expectations anchored on the inflation target will reduce the variability of inflation and the output gap. Central banks can improve transparency and accountability by specifying not only an inflation target but also the dislike of output-gap variability relative to inflation variability. Central banks can best achieve both the long-run inflation target and the best compromise between inflation and output-gap stability by engaging in forecast targeting,' where the bank selects the feasible combination of inflation and output-gap projections that minimize the loss function and the corresponding instrument-rate plan and sets the instrument-rate accordingly. Forecast targeting implies that the instrument responds to all information that significantly affects the projections of inflation and the output gap. Therefore it cannot be expressed in terms of a simple instrument rule, like a Taylor rule. The objective of financial stability, including a well-functioning payment system, can conveniently be considered as a restriction on monetary policy that does not bind in normal times, but does bind in times of financial crises. By producing and publishing Financial Stability Reports with indicators of financial stability, the central bank can monitor the degree of financial stability and issue warnings to concerned agents and authorities in due time and this way avoid deteriorating financial stability. Forecast targeting implies that asset-price developments and potential asset-price bubbles are taken into account and responded {{to the extent that they}} are deemed to affect the projections of the target variables, inflation and the output gap. In most cases, it will be difficult to make precise judgments, though, especially to identify bubbles with reasonable certainty. The zero bound, liquidity <b>traps</b> and <b>risks</b> of deflation are serious concerns for a monetary policy aimed at low inflation. Forecast targeting with a symmetric positive inflation target keeps the risk of the zero bound, liquidity traps and deflation small. Prudent central banks may want to prepare in advance contingency plans for situations when a series of bad shocks substantially increases the risk...|$|R
40|$|Live-capture {{of animals}} {{is a widely}} used {{technique}} in ecological research, and previously trapped individuals often respond to traps with either attraction or avoidance. The effects of <b>trapping</b> on animals’ <b>risk</b> perception are not often studied, although nonlethal effects of risk can significantly influence animals’ behavior and distribution. We used a combination of experimental (giving-up densities: GUDs) and behavioral (vigilance rates) measures to gauge monkeys’ perceived risk before and after a short livetrapping period aimed at ear-tagging monkeys for individual recognition as part of ongoing research. Two groups of arboreal samango monkeys, Cercopithecus albogularis schwarzi, showed aversion to capture {{in the form of}} generalized, group-level trap shyness after 2 individuals per group were cage trapped. We predicted that trapping would increase monkeys’ antipredatory behavior in trap vicinity and raise their GUDs and vigilance rates. However, live-capture led to no perceptible changes in monkeys’ use of space, vigilance, or exploitation of experimental food patches. Height above ground and experience with the experiment were the strongest predictors of monkeys’ GUDs. By the end of the experiment, monkeys were depleting patches to low levels at ground and tree heights despite the trapping perturbation, whereas vigilance rates remained constant. The presence of cage traps, reintroduced in the final 10 days of the experiment, likewise had no detectable influence on monkeys’ perceived risk. Our findings, consistent for both groups, are relevant for research that uses periodic live-capture to mark individuals subject to long-term study and more generally to investigations of animals’ responses to human interventions...|$|R
