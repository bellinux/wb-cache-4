The Doctor deems the cubes harmless and departs, though instructs Brian to keep watch.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, a new {{radio network}} based at station WBN in Chicago, Illinois, begins its inaugural night. The station's owner, General Walt Whalen, depends on his {{employees}} to impress main sponsor Bernie King. This includes writer Roger Henderson, assistant director Penny Henderson (Roger's wife, seeking divorce), page boy Billy Budget, engineer Max Applewhite, conductor Rick Rochester, announcer Dexter Morris, director Walt Whalen, Jr. and stage manager Herman Katzenback. After King commissions rewrites {{on the radio}} scripts, the WBN writers get angry, adding to the fact <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been paid in weeks.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{investigation}} has found traces of this {{drug in the}} other victims, with Black believing that the killer not only has access to it through his occupation but is likely consuming it himself while committing his crimes in order to readily act on his sexual fantasies. Black follows up on this, and investigates Nesbitt's pharmacy. Nesbitt is not working at the time, but Black realizes he must be the killer. He interviews Nesbitt's wife (Barbara Howard), finding <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> had sex in eighteen years of marriage—however, Nesbitt has recently become interested in trying again.|$|E

5|$|Opposing Force {{opens with}} Shephard riding on a V-22 Osprey with his squad. His squad discuss their deployment, {{somewhat}} irritated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been told {{what they are}} being deployed for. However, as they are nearing their Landing Zone at Black Mesa, airborne alien creatures attack the Osprey formation, causing Shephard's Osprey to crash land. Shephard regains consciousness in a Black Mesa medical bay, tended to by the science team, learning that the Marines are being steadily beaten by the alien forces from Xen and orders have come through to pull out. Consequently, Shephard departs to reach an extraction point and escape the facility. However, Shephard is prevented from reaching the extraction point by the enigmatic G-Man, forcing the evacuation craft to leave without him.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the right}} to be {{identified}} has been asserted, it applies for the duration of copyright, but only for works created after 1 August 1989. If the right is then infringed, the author or director has legal recourse. For {{the right to}} be infringed, the author must show <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been properly identified, that this was in circumstances where the work should have been attributed, and that none of the exceptions or defences apply. In regards to the lack of proper identification, for identification to be acceptable the name of the author must appear in each copy of the work in a prominent fashion, under Section 77(7) of the 1988 Act; where it is not appropriate for the author's name to appear on each copy, it must appear in a fashion that brings their identity to the attention of any person using or acquiring a copy of the work. If the work is a building, the name must be visible to people entering or approaching it. If the author specifies a pseudonym or some other form of identification when asserting the right of attribution, that form of identification should be adopted.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{chemistry}} is the philosophical {{study of the}} methodology {{and content of the}} science {{of chemistry}}. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. It includes research on general philosophy of science issues as applied to chemistry. For example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by quantum mechanics or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of how theories are confirmed in the context of confirming reaction mechanisms. Determining reaction mechanisms is difficult because they cannot be observed directly. Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible mechanisms <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> tested or even thought of. Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do not refer to specific physical entities, such as chemical bonds.|$|E

25|$|In Thackeray's own day some commentators, such as Anthony Trollope, ranked his History of Henry Esmond as his {{greatest}} work, {{perhaps because it}} expressed Victorian values of duty and earnestness, as did some of his other later novels. It is perhaps for this reason <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> survived as well as Vanity Fair, which satirises those values.|$|E
25|$|Developing {{countries}} {{claim that}} they have had problems with the implementation of the agreements reached in the earlier Uruguay Round because of limited capacity or lack of technical assistance.

Some witnesses who claimed to have seen three gunmen at the Inland Regional Center continued to assert their accounts. As of December 1, 2016, it was reported that the FBI has yet to rule out that possibility.|$|E
25|$|Three axioms presupposed by the {{scientific}} method are realism (the existence of objective reality), the existence of natural laws, and the constancy of natural law. Rather than depend on provability of these axioms, science depends on the fact <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been objectively falsified. Occam's razor and parsimony support, but do not prove, these axioms of science. The general principle of science is that theories (or models) of natural law must be consistent with repeatable experimental observations. This ultimate arbiter (selection criterion) rests upon the axioms mentioned above.|$|E
25|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{conservation}} hypothesis, people can exert self-control despite ego depletion if {{the stakes are}} high enough. Offering cash incentives or other motives for good performance counteracts the effects of ego depletion. This may seem surprising but in fact it may be highly adaptive. Given the value and importance of the capacity for self-control, it would be dangerous for a person to lose that capacity completely, and so ego depletion effects may occur because people start conserving their remaining strength. When people do exert themselves on the second task, they deplete the resource even more, as reflected in severe impairments on a third task <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> anticipated.|$|E

25|$|Undergraduates {{agree to}} adhere to an {{academic}} integrity policy called the Honor Code, established in 1893. Under the Honor Code, faculty do not proctor examinations; instead, the students proctor one another and must report any suspected violation to an Honor Committee made up of undergraduates. The Committee investigates reported violations and holds a hearing if it is warranted. An acquittal at such a hearing results {{in the destruction of}} all records of the hearing; a conviction results in the student's suspension or expulsion. The signed pledge required by the Honor Code is so integral to students' academic experience that the Princeton Triangle Club performs a song about it each fall. Out-of-class exercises fall {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline. Undergraduates are expected to sign a pledge on their written work affirming <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> plagiarized the work.|$|E
25|$|The Queensland Dung Beetle project used pitfall traps {{at sites}} across Queensland to trap dung beetles, {{which were then}} {{identified}} and recorded. Out of the 29 species that were introduced to Queensland during the Australian Dung Beetle Project of 1965-1985, 15 of these were recaptured in 2001-2002. The most abundant and widely distributed of these were Onthophagus gazella and Euoniticellus intermedius. Some species, including Copris diversus and Onitis westermanni, which had been released during the original CSIRO project, were not recovered {{at all in the}} Queensland Dung Beetle Project, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> become established. Others, for example Onthophagus obliquus and Sisyphus infuscatus have been recovered since their original release but were also not found during this study. The project identified three species, namely Onitis caffer, Copris elphenor, and Onitis vanderkelleni as candidates for redistribution to other areas of Queensland. These were chosen because, although they were not widely distributed across Queensland, they successfully established in the areas where they were found and had desirably rapid dung-burying capabilities.|$|E
25|$|There has {{nevertheless}} been widespread {{criticism that}} ALF spokespersons and activists have either failed to condemn {{acts of violence}} or have themselves engaged in it, either {{in the name of}} the ALF or under another banner. The criticism has been accompanied by dissent within the animal rights movement itself about the use of violence, and increasing attention from the police and intelligence communities. In 2002 the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors extremism in the United States, noted the involvement of the ALF in the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty campaign, which SPLC identified as using terrorist tactics—though a later SPLC report also noted <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> killed anyone. In 2005 the ALF was included in a United States Department of Homeland Security planning document listing a number of domestic terrorist threats on which the U.S. government expected to focus resources. In the UK, ALF actions are regarded as examples of domestic extremism, and are handled by the National Extremism Tactical Coordination Unit, set up in 2004 to monitor ALF and other illegal animal rights activity.|$|E
