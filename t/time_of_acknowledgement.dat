40|$|With the envisaged {{growth in}} Internet access {{services}} over networks with asymmetric links such as Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) and Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC), it becomes crucial {{to evaluate the}} performance of data transport protocols over systems in which the bottleneck link speed on the reverse path (i. e., the path followed by acknowledgements) is considerably slower than that on the forward path (i. e., the path followed by data packets). In this paper, we provide guidelines for designing network control mechanisms for supporting TCP/IP, the widely used Internet transport protocol, over such asymmetric networks. The key results underlying these guidelines are as follows: (1) For both the prevalent Tahoe version with Fast Retransmit and the Reno version of TCP, we determine the throughput as a function <b>of</b> buffering, round-trip <b>times</b> and normalized asymmetry (defined as the ratio <b>of</b> the transmission <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgements</b> (ACKs) in the reverse path to that of data packets in the forward path). We identify three modes of operation which are dependent on the forward buffer size and the normalized asymmetry, and determine {{the conditions under which}} the forward link is fully utilized. We also show that drop from front queueing of ACKs on the reverse link provides performance advantages over FIFO queueing...|$|R

Although he intended to structure the novel into five books, thus mirroring the classical tragic format, Hardy submitted to the tastes of the serial-reading public sufficiently to tack on a happy ending for Diggory Venn and Thomasin in a sixth book, Aftercourses. In Hardy's original conception, Venn retains his weird reddleman's character, while Thomasin lives out her days as a widow.|$|R

40|$|The {{films of}} Catherine Breillat are {{interpreted}} here {{through the lens}} <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgement,</b> especially insofar as that term is understood by the American philosopher Stanley Cavell.

The journeys charted by these couples are ones whose destinations aim for states <b>of</b> mutual <b>acknowledgement.</b> These journeys do not, however, result in happy endings. They do, on the contrary, tend to chart the failure or impossibility <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgement.</b> Ultimately, the failure <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgement</b> is a failure {{on the part of}} men to recognize or understand the value <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgement,</b> but the insistent demand for acknowledgement expressed by the female protagonists of Breillat's films points to the centrality of the concept <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgement</b> in her cinematic oeuvre...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a novel MAC scheme for {{broadcasting}} in IEEE 802. 11 p/WAVE standard during the CCH periods. We address two problems {{which lead to}} the same undesired result: the degradation in control channel performance. The first problem {{is related to the}} congestion control and the challenge is viewed in the random backoff mechanism to be adapted for broadcasting messages. It has been evident that the exponential back-off is not efficient in broadcast and where there are beacons. The problem becomes more challenging when these beacons have an expiry time and they are dropped once this time is reached before transmission. When the vehicle density is high, the probability to have two or more vehicles having the same random back-off increases and results in an increase of collision probability. One solution is in incrementing the Contention Window (CW) but if the CW is increased, the waiting time before transmitting increases and it results in the rise of the packet drop rate due to expiry <b>time.</b> The absence <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgement</b> for broadcast messages makes the CW adaptation very difficult. Our proposed scheme addresses this problem...|$|R
40|$|How {{does the}} expert domain `Cooperative Design' {{construct}} and constitute itself discoursively {{as a discipline}} {{in the field of}} Scandinavian System Design? In relation to this question this paper will explore some central themes within the discipline and show how it constructs its topic and domain in a discourse based on the concept of the computer as a tool. It will further examine how the discipline establishes a rgime of truth by using a specific terminology when referring to the relationship between designers and users. The discourse and the phenomena, objects and problems which lie in it will be seen in relation to its historical, societal and institutional terms of possibilities. Through the means of a diachronic analysis it will be shown that the cooperative discourse has changed in certain ways, without reflecting upon its own initial terms. Thus the analysis locates some contrasts in the discourse, especially between an explicit avoidance of the rationalistic Cartesian way of thinking and at the same <b>time</b> a lack <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgement</b> that its own discoursive practice is still marked by it. This will partly be discussed in the light of Foucault and partly by sociological and anthropological insights concerning scientific practice...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Science {{is subject}} to a {{normative}} structure that includes how the contributions and interactions between scientists are rewarded. Authorship and citations have been the key elements within the reward system <b>of</b> science, whereas <b>acknowledgements,</b> despite being a well-established element in scholarly communication, have not received the same attention. This paper aims to put forward the bearing <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgements</b> in the humanities {{to bring to the}} foreground contributions and interactions that, otherwise, would remain invisible through traditional indicators of research performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study provides a comprehensive framework to understanding <b>acknowledgements</b> as part <b>of</b> the reward system with a special focus on its value in the humanities as a reflection of intellectual indebtedness. The distinctive features of research in the humanities are outlined and the role <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgements</b> as a source of contributorship information is reviewed to support these assumptions. Findings: Peer interactive communication is the prevailing support thanked in the <b>acknowledgements</b> <b>of</b> humanities, so the notion <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgements</b> as super-citations can make special sense in this area. Since single-authored papers still predominate as publishing pattern in this domain, the study <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgements</b> might help to understand social interactions and intellectual influences that lie behind a piece of research and are not visible through authorship. Originality/value: Previous works have proposed and explored the prevailing acknowledgement types by domain. This paper focuses on the humanities to show the role <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgements</b> within the reward system and highlight publication patterns and inherent research features which make acknowledgements particularly interesting in the area as reflection of the socio-cognitive structure of research.

40|$|After {{about two}} {{years of hard work}} spent in {{planning}} and organizing the Conference “Time andlife in the Silurian: a multidisciplinary approach”, Field Meeting of the Subcommission on Silurian Stratigraphy, recently held in Sardinia in June 4 - 11, 2009, our effort has finally come to an end. The editing of the Conference Proceedings’ volume is now completed, as promised, within one-year {{by the end of the}} meeting. It has been a long but quite rewarding experience. The diverse papers here included are only apart of the multi-faceted contributions presented at the Conference sessions in Villasimius (Cagliari). Nevertheless, as also underlined by our Chairman, they reflect the multidisciplinary approach we strongly insisted on as a main topic when we proposed this meeting. We are firmly convinced that only by data integration and true comparison of results a real knowledge might effectively arise. This volume also offers a unique opportunity to expose our “special Silurian world” to non-Silurian or, more in general, to non-Palaeozoic people, and synchronize methods and approaches with those employed by specialists working in other time-slices. This has been possible thanks to the courtesyof the Società Paleontologica Italiana. Former President Ruggero Matteucci started with us this adventure accepting to reserve a volume of the Bollettino for our proceedings, present President Andrea Tintori gave us ample spaces to decide and allowed the download of pdf files at the Conference site. The Editorof the journal, Enrico Serpagli, kindly supervised our editorial efforts (but he is a Silurian-man, so it was not too hard to convince him). Furthermore, it is an occasion to make the Bollettino better known outside Italy, as most of the Silurian workers come from abroad. As usual tradition in a final phase of a project, it is also <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgements.</b> First <b>of</b> all, this work has been made possible thanks to the precious support of reviewers who have made the real editorial work on the papers, with their accurate revisions, motivating criticism and addressed suggestions. We acknowledge their excellent contributions by naming them here: Bradley D. Cramer, Jiri Fryda, Lennart Jeppsson, Michael M. Joachimski, Markes E. Johnson, Jiri Kriz, Oliver Lehnert, David Loydell, Peep Männik, Michael J. Melchin, Ken T. Ratcliffe, Jia-Yu Rong, Mena Schemm-Gregory, Hans Peter Schönlaub, John A.

Special thanks are also due to our respective families, who have tolerated us and our numerous changing moods of this last period. Finally, a message for the readers of the Bollettino della Società Paleontologica Italiana. They might find a slightly different target in this volume from the usual papers generally included in the journal. This is in the light of the new style of the Bollettino, hoping to find in a not too far future more and more multidisciplinary contributions reflecting the diverse souls of the palaeontological debate developing now in the world...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe timely <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> {{critical}} patient clinical reports {{is vital}} for the delivery of safe patient care. With current EHR systems, critical reports reside on different screens. This leads to treatment delays and inefficient work flows. As a remedy, the R. A. P. I. D. (Root Aggregated Prioritized Information Display) system represents all data on a single screen, and its simple and intuitive “button” array structure allows triaged sign-off/sign-out of critical and non-critical reports. Materials and methodsWith 100 hematology and chemistry reports from each of two EHR systems Meditech (Westwood, MA) and Orchard Labs, Inc. (Carmel, IN), we generated files of the reports in their individual standard display formats (enhanced Meditech-EM and enhanced Orchard-EO). We also displayed the same 200 reports in the R. A. P. I. D. format. We then conducted a randomized trial to compare the <b>time</b> and accuracy <b>of</b> <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> critical and non-critical results. ResultsThe sign-off times for reviewing the results for physician and non-physician providers, respectively, in seconds (with 95 % confidence intervals) were for EM 1. 78 (1. 40 – 2. 26) and 1. 99 (1. 72 – 2. 30), for EO 2. 69 (2. 12 – 3. 42) and 2. 78 (2. 40 – 3. 21), and for R. A. P. I. D. 0. 83 (0. 70 – 0. 98) and 1. 58 (1. 43 – 1. 76). Non-physician providers reassigned system-defined non-critical results as critical with a frequency of 15. 2 % for EM, 18. 4 % for EO, and 7. 83 % for R. A. P. I. D., and critical results as non-critical with a frequency of 14. 7 %, 5. 6 %, and 5. 8 % respectively. DiscussionThe new display system was superior to two standard EHR systems that were significantly enhanced by first collecting the reports from their usual distributed locations and then by creating {{for each of the}} two standard EHRs a single file <b>of</b> reports for <b>acknowledgement.</b> ConclusionsFrom a single screen display of all reports, the new display system enables timely <b>acknowledgement</b> <b>of</b> critical reports for patient safety and non-critical report triage for improved provider work flows...|$|R
