5|$|The Serjeants had {{for many}} centuries {{exclusive}} {{jurisdiction over the}} Court of Common Pleas, being the only lawyers allowed <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> there. At {{the same time they}} had rights of audience in the other central common law courts (the Court of King's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas) and precedence over all other lawyers. Only Serjeants-at-Law could become judges of these courts right up into the 19th century, and socially the Serjeants ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath. Within the Serjeants-at-Law were more distinct orders; the King's Serjeants, particularly favoured Serjeants-at-Law, and within that the King's Premier Serjeant, the Monarch's most favoured Serjeant, and the King's Ancient Serjeant, the oldest. Serjeants (except King's Serjeants) were created by Writ of Summons under the Great Seal of the Realm and wore a special and distinctive dress, the chief feature of which was the coif, a white lawn or silk skullcap, afterwards represented by a round piece of white lace {{at the top of the}} wig.|$|E
500|$|At that time, {{law school}} {{graduation}} {{was not necessary}} for bar admission, so Gordon studied on her own. On December 6, 1879, she {{was admitted to the}} State Bar of California, becoming the second female attorney in the state (after Foltz). In 1880 she established her own firm in San Francisco, where she specialized in general and criminal law. Her work included successful defenses in several murder cases. She was also the first woman in California <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> to a jury. This work attracted national attention, particularly in the case of George Wheeler, where Gordon assisted the defense and Foltz the prosecution, leading New York's National Police Gazette to write that it was a case where [...] "two females will be allowed to wag their tongues to their heart's content".|$|E
500|$|In November 1908, Macmillan {{appeared}} in London to argue, as a university graduate, for {{her right to}} vote for Scottish University seats. During her speech, the buildings of Parliament were made to suspend the temporary arrangements {{put in place to}} prevent women from entering—such arrangements had been instituted after the first militant suffrage agitations. Macmillan was the first woman <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> before the bar of the House of Lords. She was backed by her contemporary, Frances Simson, one of the first eight female graduates of Edinburgh. Given audience late in the day, Macmillan spoke for three quarters of an hour. Press reports of the appearance described her as a [...] "modern Portia." [...] In Scotland, Glasgow's The Herald reported that she began nervously but warmed to her subject and [...] "argued law in an admirable speaking voice". Two days later she continued to plead her case, this time in [...] "complete self-possession", wearing a dark red outfit and hat trimmed with ermine furs. Like other suffragists in Britain and the United States, she based her case on the words person and persons in the voting statutes, arguing that such unspecific words were no basis for the exclusion of one entire sex from voting. The court upheld both lower courts' decisions that the word persons did not include women when referring to privileges granted by the state. She lost the case, but The New York Times reported that she responded to the decision against her with the words [...] "We'll live to fight another day". In Wellington, New Zealand, the Evening Post wrote a less strident account, noting that Macmillan was cheerful in defeat. After the court adjourned, she said to a reporter from the London Daily Chronicle, [...] "I don't suppose that there is anything more to be done just now, but we shall live to fight another day." [...] No matter her exact words, her time at the House of Lords attracted worldwide publicity which proved valuable to the women's cause.|$|E

By this time, Stanton's illness was painfully visible. He grew so sickly that papers related to the case had to be delivered to him at his home. The court ruled against Stanton's client, but Stanton won an appeal at the Supreme Court to have the case remanded back to the lower court. At Christmas time, Stanton was not able to travel down the stairway of his house, so the family celebrated in his room.|$|R

5000|$|Proverbs {{are used}} by {{speakers}} {{for a variety of}} purposes. Sometimes they are used as a way of saying something gently, in a veiled way (Obeng 1996).

2500|$|Despite the {{enforced}} peace {{introduced by}} J.P. Morgan among formerly cutthroat competing railroads, Gowen found opportunity to wage legal war against his old enemies, the Standard Oil and Pennsylvania Railroad, before the then new Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). Early in 1889, {{he found himself}} in the odd position of representing an old friend, Eckley B. Coxe, in a suit before the ICC against, essentially, the same coal monopoly that Gowen himself had forged more than a decade before. Shortly before his death, many of Gowen's friends and associates noticed a change in his overall mood. They remarked upon his more somber demeanor and noted that for a trip home to Philadelphia, he had boarded the wrong train. Gowen wrote to his insurance agent on December 9, 1889, to ask if he could cash in his $90,000 life insurance policy. Three days later, after he had arrived in Washington, D.C., <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> before the Interstate Commerce Commission, Gowen purchased a revolver at a hardware store on Pennsylvania Avenue.|$|E
2500|$|After {{setting up}} {{his office in}} Portland, Stewart {{struggled}} to make a decent living. [...] The black population of Oregon remained below 1% of the state's total population until World War II. [...] Race relations of the time dictated that white Oregonians rarely hired black attorneys, and the even smaller number of educated, wealthy blacks did not offer much of a market. [...] Stewart also took on Japanese clients. [...] His wife did not work, nor did the couple own property; he earned most of his money from small legal fees. [...] Stewart did earn the respect of his legal colleagues; among them, Oregon Supreme Court Associate Justice Henry L. Benson wrote that he [...] "has established an exceptional record for industry and ability as a lawyer and his work before the Supreme Court has been commendable." [...] Stewart {{had been the first}} African American lawyer <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> before the Oregon Supreme Court in State v. Browning (1905). [...] In the case, he challenged the Portland Municipal Police Court's jurisdiction over a matter of state law. [...] Though the court ruled against him, it did so with difficulty and the case drew Stewart positive attention and respect.|$|E

6000|$|... "At first I {{called my}} Second Limitation, Sex. But {{from the outset}} I meant more than mere sexual desire, lust and lustful imaginings, more than {{personal}} reactions to beauty and spirited living, more even than what is called love. On the one hand I had in mind many appetites that are not sexual yet turn to bodily pleasure, {{and on the other}} there are elements of pride arising out of sex and passing into other regions, all the elements of rivalry for example, that have strained my first definition to the utmost. And I see now that this Second Limitation as I first imagined it spreads out without any definite boundary, to include one's rivalries with old schoolfellows, for example, one's generosities to beggars and dependents, one's desire to avenge an injured friend, one's point of honour, one's regard for the good opinion of an aunt and one's concern for the health of a pet cat. All these things may enrich, but they may also impede and limit the aristocratic scheme. I thought for a time I would call this ill-defined and miscellaneous wilderness of limitation the Personal Life. But at last I have decided to divide this vast territory of difficulties into two subdivisions and make one of these Indulgence, meaning thereby pleasurable indulgence of sense or feeling, and the other a great mass of self-regarding motives that will go with a little stretching under the heading of Jealousy. I admit motives are continually playing across the boundary of these two divisions, I should find it difficult <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> for my classification, but in practice these two groupings have a quite definite meaning for me. There is pride in the latter group of impulses and not in the former; the former are always a little apologetic. Fear, Indulgence, Jealousy, these are the First Three Limitations of the soul of man. And the greatest of these is Jealousy, because it can use pride. Over them the Life Aristocratic, as I conceive it, marches to its end. It saves itself for the truth rather than sacrifices itself romantically for a friend. It justifies vivisection if thereby knowledge is won for ever. It upholds that Brutus who killed his sons. It forbids devotion to women, courts of love and all such decay of the chivalrous idea. And it resigns--so many things that no common Man of Spirit will resign. Its intention transcends these things. Over all the world it would maintain justice, order, a noble peace, and it would do this without indignation, without resentment, without mawkish tenderness or individualized enthusiasm or any queen of beauty. It is of a cold austere quality, commanding sometimes admiration but having small hold upon the affections of men. So that it is among its foremost distinctions that its heart is steeled...." ...|$|E

40|$|This article, by {{exploring}} <b>an</b> approach <b>to</b> research, <b>argues</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> for bricolage as an acceptable approach in tourism research. Tourism researchers thinking about utilizing methodological bricolage {{as a research}} approach have little scholarly literature to draw from; therefore, it remains relatively underused and misunderstood {{as a means of}} qualitative inquiry. This article presents an account of getting to grips with a multiparadigmatic methodological bricolage as a way of understanding the world of backpacking and its inhabitants, who actively constitute, distinguish, and label themselves as backpackers. It is an approach that delivered a coherent conceptual scaffold, producing a rich, but always partial, understanding of a social world, those who inhabit it, and how they sustain it. It doing so, the research design adds to methodological innovation and diversification in tourism research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} the business context and {{results of an}} optimisation exercise for a single-radio mid-range multi-hop wireless mesh network {{for the provision of}} VoIP services. This WiFi mesh network physically covers 30 square kilometres in rural South Africa with a dozen solar-powered nodes. The firmware multiplexes the single radios in adhoc and infrastructure modes, essentially providing a distributed hotspot {{that can be used for}} WiFi-based Asterisk attachment in addition to POTS handsets via an ATA adapter in <b>a</b> node. We <b>argue</b> that this architecture is comparable yet cheaper and easier to install and maintain than multi-radio systems with directive antennas. Measurement of a range of values revealed a SlotTime setting that maximises throughput by 115 %. We leverage this finding <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>a</b> business <b>case</b> for <b>a</b> ground up community-based mesh network like this one; to provide a win-win situation for local residents and operators with free internal calls backed up by revenues from low cost voice breakout, Internet services and solar-based mobile phone charging. Our novel approach offers an accessible and affordable business model based on increased traffic volume from residents in a rural area that have mobile connectivity yet cannot afford to use it. The optimised architecture described herein offers an attractive and complementary alternative...|$|R
