Unlike its cousin, Google Now, Assistant is able to engage in <b>two-way</b> <b>conversations</b> with users. The Wall Street Journal reported in October 2016 that Google hired writers from Pixar movies and The Onion satirical newspaper to develop a personality for the Assistant, with a long-term goal being to invoke a sense of emotional rapport in users.|$|R

Eventually, these activities will lead to a stronger role of the public in the decision-making process of the museum. We analyzed the current situation faced by science museums in Europe in light of the recent discourse on public engagement with science and identified the main barriers and obstacles that prevent actual decision making of the public within the institutions. Finally, we discuss suggestions for solutions. Â© The Author(s) 2012...|$|R
50|$|Early {{users of}} mobile radio {{equipment}} included transportation and government. These systems used one-way broadcasting instead of <b>two-way</b> <b>conversations.</b> Railroads used medium frequency range (MF) communications (similar to the AM broadcast band) to improve safety. Instead of {{hanging out of}} a locomotive cab and grabbing train orders while rolling past a station, voice communications with rolling trains became possible. Radios linked the caboose with the locomotive cab. Early police radio systems were initially one way using MF frequencies above the AM broadcast band, (1.7 MHz). Some early systems talked back to dispatch on a 30-50 MHz link, (called crossband).|$|R
2500|$|In 1980, William O'Neil {{constructed}} {{an electronic}} audio device called [...] "The Spiricom". O'Neil claimed {{the device was}} built to specifications which he received psychically from George Mueller, a scientist who had died six years previously. At a Washington, DC press conference on April 6, 1982, O'Neil stated {{that he was able}} to hold <b>two-way</b> <b>conversations</b> with spirits through the Spiricom device, and provided the design specifications to researchers for free. However, nobody is known to have replicated the results O'Neil claimed using their own Spiricom devices. O'Neil's partner, retired industrialist George Meek, attributed O'Neil's success, and the inability of others to replicate it, to O'Neil's mediumistic abilities forming part of the loop that made the system work.|$|R
50|$|Hybrids and cancellers are {{sometimes}} combined with echo suppressors. These {{work on the}} assumption that usually only one of the two parties to a conversation is speaking at a given time. The suppressor switches a loss into the inactive speech path, thus enhancing the echo-cancelling effect of the hybrid at the expense of simultaneous <b>two-way</b> <b>conversation.</b>|$|E

50|$|Request-response is {{a message}} {{exchange}} pattern in which a requestor sends a request message to a replier system which receives and processes the request, ultimately returning a message in response. This is a simple, but powerful messaging pattern which allows two applications to have a <b>two-way</b> <b>conversation</b> with one another over a channel. This pattern is especially common in client-server architectures.|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} 70 voice traces {{collected from}} IPtelephony applications, multicast lectures, and multimedia conferencing sessions which involve multiple speakers and different dynamics of interaction beyond <b>two-way</b> <b>conversations.</b> Results show that application differences have {{significant impact on}} the traffic characteristics. The conventional exponential model, established for telephone conversations, fails to accurately capture the packet level activity observed in these traces, e. g., the heavy-tail distributions of the talkspurt and silence periods. We classify the traces into four types based on their audio contents: audience, lecture, multi-party conferencing and conversation. Further analysis shows that Weibull is a better matching statistical model and achieves lower mean-square-error than the exponential model (by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude) in approximating the audio streams for all four cases...|$|R
30|$|Many {{frameworks}} (Kearney et al. 2012; Koole 2009; Laurillard 2007, 2009; Motiwalla 2007; Park 2011) {{have highlighted}} communication and dialogue as key factors in education. With regard to assessment feedback, the literature emphasises {{on the importance}} of dialogue between learners and teachers. For instance, communication issues in feedback have been greatly reported due to the tendency of feedback being a monologue process from teachers to students (Bloxham and Campbell 2010). The conversation theory (Laurillard 2007, 2009) advises that successful learning needs constant <b>two-way</b> <b>conversations</b> and interactions between the educators and learners, and between learners. Communication and dialogue are about building those links between learners and teachers. In light of these findings, communication and dialogue were also identified as vital aspects of the Mobile Learning Framework for Assessment Feedback.|$|R
40|$|Most {{scientists}} believe GMOs {{are safe for}} human consumption, but {{a majority of the}} American public remains unconvinced. I argue that this lack of trust stems from scientists' outdated approach to science communication, namely the deficit model. Instead of seeing the public as empty vessels waiting to be filled with scientific knowledge, the scientific community must recognize that many strongly held beliefs about science issues are socially situated. Only through genuine attempts at participatory, <b>two-way</b> <b>conversations</b> with the public can the scientific community come to understand how public values influence GMO acceptance. While these actions will necessitate a redefining of the GMO scientific community and are sure to be difficult and intimidating, they are vital for ensuring GMOs will be available as a tool {{to address the needs of}} a growing global population and a changing climate...|$|R
50|$|The {{pickup coil}} in {{a hearing aid}} {{is known as a}} {{telecoil}} (or T-coil) because its early form was to pick up a magnetic field from coils within a telephone. These were included {{as a part of the}} method of enabling a <b>two-way</b> <b>conversation</b> over a single pair of wires. The telecoil enabled hearing aid users to hear the phone conversation more clearly without also picking up background noise around them.|$|E
50|$|An {{immediate}} {{variation of}} this is to have only two chairs in the central group. When someone in the audience wants to join the <b>two-way</b> <b>conversation,</b> they come forward and tap the shoulder of the person they want to replace, at some point when they are not talking. The tapped speaker must then return to the outer circles, being replaced by the new speaker, who carries on the conversation in their place.|$|E
50|$|Given {{that she}} is both a telepath and a precognitive, she often answers {{questions}} before they are asked and responds to comments before they are spoken aloud. As a result, she tends to turn what would ordinarily be a <b>two-way</b> <b>conversation</b> into a monologue. While she does not always do this, {{it may be assumed}} {{that she is}} allowing the other person or persons to say what she already knows they will say out of politeness' sake.|$|E
5000|$|Janet Green Dillon (nÃ©e Marlowe) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} that {{appeared on the}} daytime soap opera, All My Children. She is commonly known for terrorizing the residents of Pine Valley, including sister Natalie Marlowe, and the murder of Will Cortlandt. Janet frequently suffers from bouts of psychosis resulting from emotional abuse inflicted upon her since childhood. While experiencing psychosis, she frequently hallucinates <b>two-way</b> <b>conversations</b> with {{her reflection in the}} mirror. The hallucination looks as the character did when first introduced; homely with dark hair and glasses. Its responses are consistently critical of Janet and while it does provide her with solutions to current obstacles, the solutions are often illegal and something a reasonable individual wouldn't consider. As a result of her mental illness and erratic behavior, the character was sometimes referred to as [...] "Janet from another Planet".|$|R

40|$|Desert Research and Technology Studies (Desert RATS) is a multi-year {{series of}} {{hardware}} and operations tests carried out {{annually in the}} high desert of Arizona in the San Francisco Volcanic Field. Conducted since 1997, these activities are designed to exercise planetary surface hardware and operations in conditions where multi-day tests are achievable. Desert RATS 2011 Science Operations Test simulated the management of crewed science operations at targets that were beyond the light delay time experienced during Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) and lunar surface missions, such as a mission to a Near-Earth Object (NEO) or the martian surface. Operations at targets at these distances {{are likely to be}} the norm as humans move out of the Earth-Moon system. Operating at these distances places significant challenges on mission operations, as the imposed light-delay time makes normal, <b>two-way</b> <b>conversations</b> extremely inefficient. Consequently, the operations approach for space missions that has been exercised during the first half-century of human space operations is no longer viable, and new approaches must be devised...|$|R

With some telephones the deposit is made before making the call, and the coins are returned if the call attempt is unsuccessful (busy, no answer, etc.). With other types of telephone coins are not deposited until the call has been made and the caller hears their party answer. The deposit of coins then permits <b>two-way</b> <b>conversation</b> to proceed.|$|E

In a <b>two-way</b> <b>conversation,</b> any {{manual alphabet}} known may be used; often one speaker will fingerspell using the alphabet of the other party, as it is often easier to spell quickly in an unfamiliar alphabet than to read quickly. ISL also has a standardised system of numbers as these signs vary greatly between sign languages.|$|E

A demodulator can only be used to observe a conversation between two fax modems, usually to record the image transmitted. It cannot be used to receive a fax transmission in the usual sense, because a sending modem cannot transmit an image without first negotiating a connection with a receiving modem.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{find out}} how Millennials, new {{generation}} of internet users perceive social media marketing conducted in virtual communities. Additionally, this study focuses on providing SMEs guidelines on how to apply marketing for this specific group of consumers. Theoretical framework has been conducted after approaching theories from three perspectives: social media, transition in marketing and consumer behavior and virtual communities. Quantitative research methods have been chosen in order to provide generalizable results. Data was collected through a web-based survey published in Petsie. fi and received 520 completed questionnaires. Two multivariate statistical data analysis methods were applied. Firstly, factor analysis was conducted {{to find out}} similar behaviors and secondly, data was processed further with cluster analysis to form customer segments. Results suggest that there are five distinctive customer segments in Millennials that need to be taken into consideration separately in marketing planning.

40|$|This senior {{project was}} done to {{determine}} the best practices of social media for California wineries to use in order to connect with the Millennial generation. The California wine industry has been growing steadily for years. Much of this growth can be attributed to a generation of people in the United States called Millennials. This generation is currently between the ages of 10 and 30, and those of age are drinking wine with a passion that mirrors that of their Baby Boomer parents. Wineries are searching for the best ways in which to connect with and market to this demographic, as Millennials tend to be wary of traditional or blatant advertising, choosing instead to listen to the advise of their peers or social networking sites. Facebook and Twitter are ideal social media for wineries to use to connect with the Millennial generation, as they are viewed as genuine sources where users can actively participate in <b>two-way</b> <b>conversations</b> with other users and the winery about its brand. When used effectively, Facebook and Twitter can increase a wineryâs profits and establish a loyal Millennial customer base for years to come...|$|R
