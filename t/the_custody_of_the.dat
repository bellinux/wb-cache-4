Though much altered through the centuries, some parts of Gundulf's work survive. In 1127 King HenryI granted the castle to the Archbishop of Canterbury in perpetuity. William de Corbeil built the massive keep that still dominates the castle today. Throughout the 12thcentury the castle remained in <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> archbishops.|$|E

5|$|When the French Government first {{investigated}} {{the idea of}} overhauling their system of measurement, the concept of universality was put into practice in 1789: Maurice de Talleyrand, acting on Condorcet's advice, invited John Riggs Miller, a British parliamentarian and Thomas Jefferson, the American Secretary of State to George Washington, {{to work with the}} French in producing an international standard by promoting legislation in their respective legislative bodies. However, these early overtures failed and <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metric system remained {{in the hands of the}} French government until 1875.|$|E
5|$|After the Republic was proclaimed, the {{national}} flag was provisionally adopted as distinguishing {{flag of the}} head of state in place of the royal standard. On the initiative of the Ministry of Defence, a project was prepared in 1965 to adopt a distinct flag. Opportunity suggested the most natural solution was the Italian tricolour defaced with the coat of arms; however, under conditions of poor visibility, this could easily be mistaken for the standard of the President of the United States of Mexico, which is also that country's national flag. The standard is kept in <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commander of the Reggimento Corazzieri of the Arma dei Carabinieri, along with the war flag (assigned to Regiment in 1878).|$|E
5|$|Charles's only {{recourse}} was {{to return}} to negotiations, which were held at Newport on the Isle of Wight. On 5 December 1648, Parliament voted by 129 to 83 to continue negotiating with the king, but Oliver Cromwell and the army opposed any further talks with someone they viewed as a bloody tyrant and were already taking action to consolidate their power. Hammond was replaced as Governor of the Isle of Wight on 27 November, and placed in <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army the following day. In Pride's Purge on 6 and 7 December, the members of Parliament out of sympathy with the military were arrested or excluded by Colonel Thomas Pride, while others stayed away voluntarily. The remaining members formed the Rump Parliament. It was effectively a military coup.|$|E

50|$|For simplicity, {{this article}} uses the model where the mother becomes <b>the</b> parent with <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{children}} and the father makes child support payments, {{with the understanding that}} this model has become less typical. For example, {{a man and a woman}} marry in West Virginia. During the marriage, the husband and the wife have children. In West Virginia, the husband and the wife divorce. West Virginia issues a divorce decree that gives <b>the</b> wife <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children and orders the husband to pay child support. Subsequently, the wife moves to Connecticut with the children. Due to a change in circumstances, the husband, who may or may not still reside in West Virginia, seeks a modification of West Virginia’s divorce decree. The conflict was over which state's guidelines are to apply.|$|R

5|$|During the 15th century, {{the castle}} became {{increasingly}} valued for its hunting facilities {{rather than its}} military defences. It fell into disrepair and, despite {{the construction of new}} living quarters and service facilities, {{by the middle of the}} 16th century it was derelict. Henry VIII sold the property to Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, and most of the castle buildings were demolished. It was not until the 19th century, when Mary and Fulke Greville Howard inherited the property, that the castle was renovated and restored. Victorian scholars examined the site, and it was opened to the public. In 1958 the castle passed into <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state, which carried out further stabilisation work and a programme of archaeological investigation. In 1998 English Heritage passed the management of the site back to its current owner, Baron Howard of Rising, who continues to operate the castle as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert de Clare {{was the son}} of Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester – {{known as}} Gilbert 'the Red' – who in 1290 married Joan of Acre, {{daughter}} of EdwardI. As a condition for the marriage, the earl had to surrender all his lands to the king, only to have them returned jointly to himself and his wife for the lifetime of either. This grant was made on the condition that the lands would pass to the couple's joint heirs, but if they were childless to Joan's heirs from any later marriages. The younger Gilbert was born the next year, around 10May 1291, securing the inheritance for the de Clare family, but his father died only four years later, on 7December 1295, while the boy was still a minor. Because of the joint enfeoffment, Joan kept <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family lands, and did homage to the king on 20January the next year.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 2009, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia {{issued an}} arrest warrant for Guandique. He was {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> District of Columbia Department of Corrections on April 20 via the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City. Two days later, Guandique was charged in D.C. with Levy's murder. He was indicted by a grand jury on six counts: kidnapping, first-degree murder committed during a kidnapping, attempted first-degree sexual abuse, first-degree murder committed during a sexual offense, attempted robbery, and first-degree murder committed during a robbery. Guandique pleaded not guilty at his arraignment, where a trial date was initially set for January 27, 2010. His lawyers argued that Guandique's federal prison cell was outside the jurisdiction of a court-ordered search. After errors in processing contaminated some of the gathered evidence with DNA from employees of the prosecution, the start date of the trial at the H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse was moved to October 4, 2010.|$|E

After the International Prototype Kilogram had been found to vary in mass over time relative to its reproductions, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) recommended in 2005 that the kilogram be redefined in terms of a fundamental constant of nature. At its 2011 meeting, the CGPM agreed in principle that the kilogram should be redefined in terms of the Planck constant. The decision was originally deferred until 2014; in 2014 it was deferred again until the next meeting. There are currently several different proposals for the redefinition (some of which have been abandoned); these are described in the Proposed Future Definitions section below.|$|E
5|$|The ground {{operation}} {{was conducted by}} D Squadron, 22 Regiment Special Air Service—who assaulted Gberi Bana {{in a bid to}} extract the Royal Irish—and elements of 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment (1 PARA), who launched a diversionary assault on Magbeni. The operation freed the five soldiers as well as twenty-one Sierra Leonean civilians who had been held prisoner by the West Side Boys. At least twenty-five West Side Boys were killed in the assault, as was one British soldier, while eighteen West Side Boys—including the gang's leader, Foday Kallay—were taken prisoner and later transferred to <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sierra Leone Police.

5|$|Earl Henry was {{not present}} at the battle, {{but there is little}} doubt that he participated in the rebellion. After a short imprisonment, he was pardoned, and in June 1404 he {{delivered}} his grandson into the king's custody at Doncaster. By May 1405, however, the earl was involved in another rebellion. His plans failed, and he was forced to flee to Scotland, taking his grandson with him. The following years were marked by an itinerant life and further plotting, while the young Henry remained in <b>the</b> <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Albany. On 19 February 1408, the first earl of Northumberland was killed in the Battle of Bramham Moor, leaving the young Henry Percy as heir apparent to the earldom. Henry remained in Scotland until the accession of Henry V in 1413, when he tried to claim his grandfather's title. His cause was aided by the king's aunt, Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland, who arranged his marriage to her daughter Eleanor. It was in Henry V's interest to reconcile with the Percys, with their vast network in the north of England; in 1416 Henry Percy was created Earl of Northumberland.|$|E
