To this day, she easily shifts between her American and English accents. In May 2013, during an interview with BlogTalkRadio, Anderson addressed the matter of her national identity: [...] "I've been asked whether I feel more like a Brit than an American and I don't know what the answer <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>is.</b> I know that I feel that London is home and I'm very happy with that as my home. I love London as a city and I feel very comfortable there. In terms of identity, I'm still a bit baffled." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Labour Party came {{to power}} in 1997 with a {{manifesto}} saying, [...] "We will ensure greater protection for wildlife. We have advocated new measures to promote animal welfare, including a free vote in Parliament on whether hunting with hounds should be banned." [...] A new private member's bill, introduced by Michael Foster MP, received a second reading with 411 MPs voting in support, but failed due to lack of parliamentary time. The Burns Report in 2000 concluded that forms of fox hunting [...] "seriously compromise the welfare of the fox", but (in line with its remit) did not draw any conclusion on whether hunting should be banned or should continue. In a later debate in the House of Lords, the inquiry chairman, Lord Burns also stated that [...] "Naturally, people ask whether we were implying that hunting is cruel... The short answer <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> no. There was not sufficient verifiable evidence or data safely to reach views about cruelty. It is a complex area." [...] Following the Burns inquiry, the Government introduced an 'options bill' which allowed each House of Parliament to choose between a ban, licensed hunting, and self-regulation. The House of Commons voted for a banning bill and the House of Lords for self-regulation. The 2001 general election was then called and the bill ran out of parliamentary time.|$|E

60|$|Here is a feature, then, great {{or small}} {{as it may}} be, which distinguishes natural species of animals. Can we find any {{approximation}} to this in the different races known to be produced by selective breeding from a common stock? Up to the present time the answer <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> absolutely a negative one. As {{far as we know}} at present, there is nothing approximating to this check. In crossing the breeds between the Fantail and the Pouter, the Carrier and the Tumbler, or any other variety or race you may name--so far as we know at present--there is no difficulty in breeding together the mongrels. Take the Carrier and the Fantail, for instance, and let them represent the Horse and the Ass in the case of distinct species; then you have, as the result of their breeding, the Carrier-Fantail mongrel,--we will say the male and female mongrel,--and, as far as we know, these two when crossed would not be less fertile than the original cross, or than Carrier with Carrier. Here, you see, is a physiological contrast between the races produced by selective modification and natural species. I shall inquire into the value of this fact, and of some modifying circumstances by and by; for the present I merely put it broadly before you.|$|E

50|$|The answer <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> {{telecommunications}} products, {{primarily the}} satellite earth station, a large mobile dish used to receive signals transmitted from communications satellites orbiting the earth. In 1973 the company displayed a portable satellite earth station at a communications trade show in California. It planned {{to sell the}} portable stations to companies in the relatively new and rapidly growing cable television field so they could transmit their programming to {{a large number of}} stations in different areas. The stations, in turn, would send the programming to consumers' homes over their cable networks. At the time, however, observers told Scientific-Atlanta executives that satellite transmission of cable television programming would take place only in the distant future.|$|R
60|$|The answer <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not {{overwhelmingly}} difficult. The German people {{sticks to}} its militarist imperialism as Mazeppa {{stuck to his}} horse; because it is bound to it, and the wolves pursue. The attentive student {{of the home and}} foreign propaganda literature of the German Government will realize that the case made by German imperialism, the main argument by which it sticks to power, is this, that the Allied Governments are also imperialist, that they also aim at conquest and aggression, that for Germany the choice is world empire or downfall and utter ruin. This is the argument that holds the German people stiffly united. For most men in most countries it would be a convincing argument, strong enough to override considerations of right and wrong. I find that I myself am of this way of thinking, that whether England has done right or wrong in the past--and I have sometimes criticized my country very bitterly--I will not endure the prospect of seeing her at the foot of some victorious foreign nation. Neither will any German who matters. Very few people would respect a German who did. But the case for the Allies is that this great argument by which, and by which alone, the German Imperial Government keeps its grip upon the German people at the present time, and keeps them facing their enemies, is untrue. The Allies declare that {{they do not want to}} destroy the German people, they do not want to cripple the German people; they want merely to see certain gaping wounds inflicted by Germany repaired, and beyond that reasonable requirement they want nothing but to be assured, completely assured, absolutely assured, against any further aggressions on the part of Germany.|$|E

5000|$|In 1930, Albert Einstein {{prompted}} a theological discussion through the New York Times Magazine. Eight renown theologians {{responded to the}} physicist’s views on religion. The Reverend John Haynes Holmes of the Community Church endorsed Einstein’s view and noted that it answered one half of two essential questions in human existence. The first question, what is this world? The answer <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> provided by “Science.” The second question, {{what can be done}} with the world? The answer <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> provided by “Religion.” In laying out this analysis, Reverend Holmes noted, “this is surely what Professor Nathaniel Schmidt means when he says in this recent book, “The Coming Religion,” that religion is “man’s consciousness of some power in nature determining man’s destiny, and the ordering of his life in harmony with its demands.” [...] The commenter then continued by noting that Schmidt’s work in The Coming Religion established the theological framework for theology half of Einstein’s two-question dichotomy. There is a sense in Schmidt’s work of the late 1920s and early 1930s that the First World War changed the nature of people’s religious beliefs. In particular, he observed that traditional manifestations of religious expression were in decline, but that the boundaries of religious expression were expanding, and “the essence of religion gaining in clarity, purity and depth.” [...] With respect {{to the study of the}} Hebraic roots of Western culture, Schmidt’s final position was that the expansion of historical knowledge, a widening of the historians subject-matter reach, had lessened the importance of Hebrew heritage.|$|E
