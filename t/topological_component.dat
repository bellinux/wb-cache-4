40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simple construction {{for building a}} combinatorial model of a smooth manifold-solid from a labeled figure representing its occluding contour. The motivation is twofold. First, deriving the combinatorial model is an essential intermediate step in the visual reconstruction of solid-shape from image contours. A description of solid-shape consists of a metric and a <b>topological</b> <b>component.</b> Both are necessary: the metric component specifies how the <b>topological</b> <b>component</b> is embedded in three-dimensional space. The paneling construction described in this paper is a procedure for generating the <b>topological</b> <b>component</b> from a labeled figure representing an occluding contour. Second, {{the existence of this}} construction establishes the sufficiency of a labeling scheme for line-drawings of smooth solid-objects originally proposed by Huffman[5]. By sufficiency, it is meant that every set of closed planecurves satisfying this labeling scheme is shown to correspond to a generic vie [...] ...|$|E

The conditions necessary {{to insure that}} the <b>topological</b> <b>component</b> is unambiguous are well understood. However, in algebriac modeling systems (as opposed to polyhedral modeling systems), an unambiguous topological structure can have noncongruent geometric interpretations with identical vertex coordinates, face equations and edge descriptions using the usual representation of edges as the intersection of faces along with tangent vectors at vertices. This means that the conversion of a CSG tree that unambiguously describes a solid can lead to an ambiguous boundary representations unless additional information is retained in the boundary representation.

The mesh topology is described by a <b>topological</b> <b>component</b> which also provides algorithms for performing topological changes (cutting, refinement). An important aspect of the design is that mesh related data is not centralized in the mesh data structure but stored in each dedicated component. Furthermore, topo-logical changes are handled in a transparent way for the user through a mechanism of propagation of topological events from the topological components toward other components. Finally, the previous concepts have been extended to provide multiple topologies for the same degrees of freedom.

When p(ξ) is of an even degree, the equilibrium measure is supported on two disjoint intervals as t is negatively large; it is supported on a single interval for convex p(x) as t is positively large and is likely to be supported on multiple disjoint intervals for non-convex p(x). The support of the equilibrium measure shrinks to isolated points as |t | → + ∞ in all the cases that we consider.

Five N-terminally acetylated, C-terminally amidated oligopeptides containing one (HIV- 1 Gag 218 – 224; 1), two (HIV- 1 Gag 218 – 226 and HIV- 1 Gag 217 − 224; 2 and 3, respectively), three (HIV- 1 Gag 217 – 226; 4) or four (HIV- 1 Gag 213 − 237; 5) proline residues were synthesized. Using competition experiments with a standard substrate the binding affinities to Cyp 18 of the synthesized peptides were determined. The IC 50 value of 184 μ. M for the 25 -mer peptide 5 was fivefold or more lower than those of the peptides 1 – 4 lacking one or more prolines. Failure of competition in assays containing enzymes of other PPIase families by millimolar concentrations of 5 revealed a Cyp 18 specific interaction involving the active site of the enzyme. In its far UV circular dichroism, aqueous solutions of 5 display properties of random coil conformation, but spectra were also consistent with a small contribution of proline specific secondary structures.

We show that a block contains a pseudoknot {{if and only if}} the block has a vertex of degree 3 or more; this characterization allows us to efficiently isolate smaller RNA fragments and classify them as pseudoknotted or pseudoknot-free regions, while keeping these sub-structures intact. Even though non-topological techniques to detect and classify pseudoknots have been efficiently applied, structural properties of dual graphs provide a unique perspective for the further analysis of RNAs.

40|$|Faults {{networks}} exist over a {{range of}} scales and are important for understanding the brittle deformation and fluid transport processes within the Earth’s crust. Analysing fault networks by characterizing the organization of faulting within them; the distribution of numerous attributes (i. e. displacement, density, strain etc.); and assessing their connectivity is essential, as these provide information about a fault networks behaviour, growth and development. This thesis presents an analysis of various strike-slip and normal fault networks from north Devon, New Zealand and Alaska. The fault networks are interpreted using an array of datasets such as field observation, aerial photography, multibeam bathymetry, high resolution seismic profiles and 3 -D seismic volumes. These are integrated with ArcGIS and robust methodologies are used to analyse each network. Spatial mapping of various attributes indicates {{that there is much}} heterogeneity in the organization of faulting within fault networks. Different domains, defined by their deformation style and/or their kinematic behaviour, can develop within a fault network. Domino domains have a dominant fault set with larger displacements, which controls systematic rotation of faults and bedding. Conjugate domains form when there are equal sizes and proportions of each fault set and show little or no rotation of bedding. Domains interact with one another and can form large damage zones to accommodate changes in strain. Strain accommodated by each domain can vary within a network and is either distributed across numerous faults or localized to a few large faults, however, the network will preserve strain compatibility between domains. Fault interactions including splays, abutments and cross-cutting relationships are characterized by different displacement profiles. These can be divided into two groups based on their kinematics: antithetic interactions and synthetic interactions, which involve faults with the opposite and same motion senses, respectively. Fault development can be influenced by interactions with pre-existing structures. When earlier fault generations are reactivated they affect the orientation, displacement and distribution of new fault generations. A topological analysis is developed to characterize fault networks and assess connectivity. This considers a network to comprise of nodes (I, Y and X) and branches (I-I, I-C and C-C) between nodes. The number and proportion of each <b>topological</b> <b>component</b> can be used to produce parameters that relate to the connectivity of a network, such as the number of connections per line or per branch.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} interest on semistate models based on differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) for the analysis and simulation of non-linear electrical circuits. Modelling techniques such as Node Tableau Analysis (NTA), Augmented Nodal Analysis (ANA), or Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA), the latter used e. g. in the circuit simulation programs SPICE and TITAN, set up network equations in differentialalgebraic form[48, 59, 60, 139]. The index of a DAE circuit model becomes a standard measure for the analytical and numerical difficulties faced in simulations [16, 60, 65]. Roughly speaking, the notion of the index {{can be thought of as}} the number of steps that are necessary to split the original differential-algebraic systemin to two uncoupled systems: an algebraic one, and an explicit differential one. In particular, index zero systems amount to explicit ODEs, while for index one DAEs the aforementioned splitting can be obtained in a relatively simple manner. Differential-algebraic systems with an index higher than one, usually called higher index systems, are more difficult and specific approaches are necessary for their simulation (see e. g. [65, Chap. VII]). In this direction, the topological characterization of low index (index less than two) circuit configurations has become increasingly important, and it is performed by current circuit simulators [46]. Characterizations of this type do not only place analytical conditions on the circuit devices but they also demand the existence or absence of certain configurations on the circuit digraph, which retains the electrical nature of the circuit elements but not their specific constitutive equations. In previous works, passivity assumptions on circuit devices have been very helpful to simplify the characterization of the index for the resulting models [48, 131, 139]. These assumptions amount to the positive definiteness of the incremental conductance and reactance matrices, this being equivalent to demanding that all conductances and reactances are positive in uncoupled circuits. Restricting the coupling effects allowed in the circuit, the present work introduces novel tree-based methods allowing us to characterize the index of common nodal models in a more general framework, based on algebraic assumptions on certain trees within the network. This tree-based index calculation generalizes previous results, making it possible to characterize the index of uncoupled circuits including both passive and active devices. Our results focus mainly on the augmented nodal analysis and the modified nodal analysis formulations. While modified nodal analysis models have been widely studied froma non-linear DAE perspective [45, 48, 95, 130, 139], the augmented nodal analysis formulation was presented in [131] as an intermediate step between MNA and NTA, preserving the index one conditions of node tableau. In the present work, we employ different types of trees for the characterization of low index configurations in the different models. Index one ANA systems are characterized by certain conditions on the proper trees in the circuit. In turn, index one conditions for MNA are stated in terms of normal trees. Proper and normal trees were introduced by Bashkow [11] and Bryant [21, 22, 23], respectively. A key step in our proofs is the factorization of the matrices describing index one for ANA and MNA, where the Cauchy-Binet formula allows us to split the <b>topological</b> <b>component</b> of the circuit from the characteristics of the devices. The study of the above-mentioned matrices, in particular of those describing index zero for MNA and index one for ANA, leads to the notion of an augmented nodal matrix. In the abstract terms of a coloured digraph, this type of matrix allows us not only to characterize low index configurations but also to analyze other problems in circuit theory, such as the DC-solvability condition for equilibriump oints of well-posed circuits [31, 46, 54, 55, 130, 137, 138]. In this context, the characterization of proper and normal trees in abstract coloured digraphs defines a result of independent interest, which allows us to delve into the kernel of the augmented nodal matrix. Regarding this problem, we prove that the normal trees of a green/blue connected graph are defined by all possible combinations of a forest of the green subgraph and a tree of the so-called blue-cut minor. Similarly, for three-colour connected graphs, we show that normal trees can be characterized in terms of red-cut minors and normal forests of the green/blue subgraph. Finally, in order to study the rank of augmented nodal matrices for problems including couplings or controlled branches, we present the novel notions of a balanced tree and a regular tree pair. Although they are introduced in the simpler and more general context of coloured digraphs, both notions can be directly transposed to a circuit theoretic setting. This allows us to examine networks including coupled capacitors or Voltage-Controlled Current Sources (VCCS), which are present in most integrated circuits [5, 87, 136]. Specifically, we present here characterizations of the DC-solvability problemand index one configurations in ANA models of circuits including controlled sources. Additionally, index zero configurations in MNA models are examined for circuits including coupled capacitors...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of IRAS maps of five molecular clouds: Orion, Ophiuchus, Perseus, Taurus, and Lupus. For the classification and description of these astrophysical maps, we use a newly developed technique which considers all maps of a given type to be elements of a pseudometric space. For each physical characteristic of interest, this formal system assigns a distance function (a pseudometric) to the space of all maps: this procedure allows us to measure quantitatively the difference between any two maps and to order the space of all maps. We thus obtain a quantitative classification scheme for molecular clouds. In this present study we use the IRAS continuum maps at 100 and 60 micrometer(s) to produce column density (or optical depth) maps for the five molecular cloud regions given above. For this sample of clouds, we compute the 'output' functions which measure the distribution of density, the distribution of <b>topological</b> <b>components,</b> the self-gravity, and the filamentary nature of the clouds. The results of this work provide a quantitative description of the structure in these molecular cloud regions. We then order the clouds according to the overall environmental 'complexity' of these star-forming regions. Finally, we compare our results with the observed populations of young stellar objects in these clouds and discuss the possible environmental effects on the star-formation process. Our {{results are consistent with}} the recently stated conjecture that more massive stars tend to form in more 'complex' environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of modern enterprise networks is ever-increasing, and {{our understanding of}} these important networks is not keeping pace. Our insight into intra-subnet traffic (staying within a single LAN) is particularly limited, due to {{the widespread use of}} Ethernet switches that preclude ready LAN-wide monitoring. We have recently undertaken an approach to obtaining extensive intra-subnet visibility based on tapping sets of Ethernet switch ports simultaneously. However, doing so leads to a number of measurement calibration issues that require careful consideration to address. First, one must correctly account for redundant copies of packets that appear due to switch flooding, which if not accurately identified can greatly skew subsequent analysis results. We show that a simple, natural rule one might use for doing so in fact introduces systematic errors, but an altered version of the rule performs significantly better. We then employ this revised rule to aid with calibration issues concerning the fidelity of packet timestamps and the amount of measurement loss that our collection apparatus incurred. Additionally, we develop techniques to “map ” the monitored network in terms of identifying key <b>topological</b> <b>components,</b> such as subnet boundaries, which hosts were directly monitored, and the presence of “hidden ” switches and hubs. Finally, we present initial analyses demonstrating that the magnitude and diversity of traffic at the subnet level is in fact striking, highlighting the importance of obtaining and correctly calibrating switch-level enterprise traces...|$|R

This is useful in &quot;massive slicing &quot; where slices are required for many {{or all of the}} possible set of slicing criteria. Several different techniques are considered, including forming strongly connected <b>components,</b> <b>topological</b> sorting, and removing transitive edges...|$|R
40|$|A layered {{approach}} for identifying {{communities in the}} Web is presented and explored by applying the Flake Exact Community Identification Algorithm to the UK academic Web. Although community or topic identification is a common task in information retrieval, a new perspective is developed by: (a) the application of Alternative Document Models, shifting the focus from individual pages to aggregated collections based upon Web directories, domains and entire sites; (b) the removal of internal site links; and (c) the adaptation of a new fast algorithm to allow fully automated community identification using all possible single starting points. The overall topology of the graphs in the three least aggregated layers was first investigated and found to include {{a large number of}} isolated points but, surprisingly, with most of the remainder being in one huge connected component, exact proportions varying by layer. The community identification process then found that the number of communities far exceeded the number of <b>topological</b> <b>components,</b> indicating that community identification is a potentially useful technique, even with random starting points. Both the number and size of communities identified was dependant on the parameter of the algorithm, with very different results being obtained in each case. In conclusion, the UK academic Web is embedded with layers of non-trivial communities and, if it is not unique in this, then there is the promise of (a) improved results for information retrieval algorithms that can exploit this additional structure, and (b) the application of the technique directly to partially automate Web metrics tasks such as that of finding all pages related to a given subject hosted by a single country’s universities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{availability}} of interaction databases {{provides an opportunity}} for researchers to utilize immense amounts of data exclusively in silico. Recently there has been an emphasis on studying the global properties of biological interactions using network analysis. While this type of analysis offers a wide variety of global insights it has surprisingly not been used to examine more localized interactions based on mechanism. In as such we have particular interest in the role of key <b>topological</b> <b>components</b> in signal transduction cascades as they are vital regulators of healthy and diseased cell states. Results We have used publicly available databases and a novel software tool termed Hubview to model the interactions of a subset of the yeast interactome, specifically protein kinases and their interaction partners. Analysis of the connectivity distribution has inferred a fat-tailed degree distribution with parameters consistent with those found in other biological networks. In addition, Hubview identified a functional clustering of a large group of kinases, distributed between three separate groupings. The complexity and average degree for each of these clusters is indicative of a specialized function (cell cycle propagation, DNA repair and pheromone response) and relative age for each cluster. Conclusion Using connectivity analysis on a functional subset of proteins we have evidence that reinforces the scale free topology as a model for protein network evolution. We have identified the hub components of the kinase network and observed a tendency for these kinases to cluster together on a functional basis. As such, these results suggest an inherent trend to preserve scale free characteristics at a domain based modular level within large evolvable networks. </p...|$|R
