[...] The show deals with the theme of death, which Tsamere said is [...] "a bit strange, but it has the virtue of attracting the public's attention". He said that he and his co-authors thought that [...] "the most irrefutable reason to go on stage ... was <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> strong". Tsamere {{has described}} how the show changed as the size of its audiences grew and he incorporated improvisations.|$|E

'You're going to be worth $13 million. You're {{going to be a very}} rich young lady.' I'd say, 'I don't want to talk about the millions of dollars now. Can we put that on hold? I just want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> good'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Often, what {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as a deep philosophical problem will vanish, argues Wittgenstein, and eventually be seen as a confusion about the significance of the words that philosophers use to frame such problems and questions. It is only in this way that it is interesting <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> like a [...] "private language" [...] — i.e., it is helpful to see how the [...] "problem" [...] results from a misunderstanding.|$|E

2500|$|One {{attempt to}} define {{goodness}} {{describes it as}} a property {{of the world with}} transcendental realism. According to this claim, to talk about the good is <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> real that exists in the object itself, independent of the perception of it. Plato advocated this view, in his expression {{that there is such a}} thing as an eternal realm of forms or ideas, and that the greatest of the ideas and the essence of being was goodness, or The good. [...] The good was defined by many ancient Greeks and other ancient philosophers as a perfect and eternal idea, or blueprint. [...] The good is the right relation between all that exists, and this exists in the mind of the Divine, or some heavenly realm. [...] The good is the harmony of a just political community, love, friendship, the ordered human soul of virtues, and the right relation to the Divine and to Nature. [...] The characters in Plato's dialogues mention the many virtues of a philosopher, or a lover of wisdom.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Thirteen," [...] the Grounders {{celebrate}} their Ascension Day, a holy day for Grounders. Octavia {{and a man}} named Semet walk in claiming the Sky People destroyed their village. Discussing the situation, Titus wants Lexa to destroy the thirteenth clan while Clarke thinks they just need time to take out Pike from the inside. Speaking to everyone, Lexa orders the armies not to attack, but instead make a perimeter around Arkadia and says that any Sky Person found past the five mile buffer will be killed. Semet is angry at this and attempts to kill Lexa, but is stopped by Titus who kills him. Later, Titus is against Clarke staying, believing she further endangers Lexa's life. He warns Lexa that, just like with Costia, {{she may not be}} able to separate feelings from duty. Lexa is enraged at this, reminding him that because she let Ice Nation into her coalition even after they cut off Costia's head and sent it to her bed, she is more than capable of separating feelings from duty. Later, Clarke goes into Lexa's room and realizes she is saying goodbye. Clarke says the reason she is going back is because the Sky People are her people. Lexa says that this devotion is what makes Clarke the person she is. Clarke suggests that maybe someday they will owe nothing more to their people, and Lexa responds with [...] "May we meet again." [...] Clarke kisses her and they have sex. Afterward, Clarke admires Lexa's tattoos, pointing out there are only seven circles on her back despite there being nine participants. Lexa tells her she got the one on her back on her Ascension Day, and asks <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> else. Clarke agrees and they become intimate again.|$|E

60|$|Madeline {{and he sat}} down, {{very many}} times, jointly to produce a letter which should acquaint John at full length with his altered fortunes, and assure him of his {{friendship}} and gratitude. It so happened, however, that the letter could never be written. Although they applied themselves to it with the best intentions in the world, it chanced that they always fell <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> else, and when Nicholas tried it by himself, he {{found it impossible to}} write one-half of what he wished to say, or to pen anything, indeed, which on reperusal did not appear cold and unsatisfactory compared with what he had in his mind. At last, after going on thus from day to day, and reproaching himself more and more, he resolved (the more readily as Madeline strongly urged him) to make a hasty trip into Yorkshire, and present himself before Mr and Mrs Browdie without a word of notice.|$|R

They suggested a few people, one of them Buck Henry whom Brooks chose as his writer. They wrote a take-off of spy stories, {{with the idea that}} they thought that the people running their country were inept, and that they would show the world. It took them 3 and a half months, because they enjoyed playing pool so much.|$|R

And then we'd start <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> issues or problems or relationships with people. That was the only way, because you know, writing together with somebody is very intimate. So {{we had to find}} a place <b>to</b> start <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> we cared <b>about,</b> so we could get into writing <b>about</b> <b>something</b> we cared about."

6000|$|FROM {{that time}} out, we {{was with him}} 'most all the time, and one or t'other of us slept in his upper berth. He {{said he had been}} so lonesome, and it was such a comfort to him to have company, and {{somebody}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> in his troubles. We was in a sweat to find out what his secret was, but Tom said the best way was not to seem anxious, then likely he would drop into it himself in one of his talks, but if we got to asking questions he would get suspicious and shet up his shell. It turned out just so. It warn't no trouble to see that he WANTED <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it, but always along at first he would scare away from it when he got on the very edge of it, and go <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> else. The way it come about was this: He got to asking us, kind of indifferent like, about the passengers down on deck. We told him about them. But he warn't satisfied; we warn't particular enough. He told us to describe them better. Tom done it. At last, when Tom was describing one of the roughest and raggedest ones, he gave a shiver and a gasp and says: ...|$|R
5000|$|... “If the Candy Girls were art and {{not just}} an {{internet}} soap one might compare its visual language to works by kitsch art icon Jeff Koons or with works by video artist Francesco Vezzoli. Dehne reflects on this and replies: ‘In their own divergent ways Koons and Vezzoli have dealt with pornchic. Both use its beauty and absurdity in order <b>to</b> actually <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> more than just sex. It has to pounce on you and be so obvious that it tips over and affords the viewer a glimpse of what’s behind.’” ...|$|R

60|$|Stannard {{said nothing}} and Laura was quiet. She was {{disturbed}} about Jimmy, {{but she knew}} her father. Besides, she thought Stevens curious. By and by she looked at Dillon, who began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> else.|$|E
60|$|She {{rose and}} led the way into the other room.

50|$|Bayes {{introduces}} the next {{scene in which}} Prince Pretty-Man and Prince Volscius argue because they love two different women. They are arguing over whose woman is better. Bayes keeps interjecting comments about how excellent the lines are. Pretty-Man starts out saying how he wants <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Volscius <b>about</b> <b>something.</b> Volscius response that he will listen {{but there is no}} way that Pretty-Man’s love is greater than his. Pretty-Man and Volscius begin to go back and forth arguing about how great their loves are. They declare their loves are so divine that even gods cannot compare. Their comparisons are very extreme and outlandish. Parthenope is the woman that Prince Volscius loves and Cloris is she whom Prince Pretty-Man loves. At the end of the scene the argument is not actually resolved, because Bayes drops his wig. Johnson wonders why the scene is suddenly all in verse in comparison to the rest of the play and Bayes’s responds that the subject is too lofty for prose. Bayes continues to congratulate himself on the magnificence of his writing.|$|R

Now, being his lawyer, Robert can't say anything about what he saw. But that doesn't stop him from investigating what his dead friend was so worried about.
