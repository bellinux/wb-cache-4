5|$|The {{most common}} fossils of megalodon are its teeth. Diagnostic {{characteristics}} include a triangular shape, robust structure, large size, fine serrations, {{a lack of}} lateral denticles, and a visible V-shaped neck (where the root meets the crown). <b>The</b> <b>tooth</b> met the jaw at a steep angle, similar to the great white shark. <b>The</b> <b>tooth</b> was anchored by connective tissue fibers, and the roughness of the base may have added to mechanical strength. The lingual side of <b>the</b> <b>tooth,</b> the part facing the tongue, was convex; and the labial side, {{the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>tooth,</b> was slightly convex or flat. The anterior teeth were almost perpendicular to the jaw and symmetrical, whereas the posterior teeth were slanted and asymmetrical.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament is {{a specialized}} connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers {{the root of}} <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15–0.38mm, but this size decreases over time. The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> to the bone, support for <b>the</b> <b>tooth,</b> formation and resorption of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption. The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez. Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> and forms a network around <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> toward {{the crest of the}} gingiva. When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> moves slightly in its socket and puts tension on the periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tooth</b> enamel is well {{preserved}} {{over most}} of <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b> It consists of prisms—bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals—with an average diameter of 3.8m. Most are entirely surrounded by a sheath, but in some the sheath is open. The prisms are slightly curved toward the outer surface of <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b> Between the prisms, and oriented at an angle of about 45° to them, are crystals of interprismatic material. On average, the prisms are 6.57μm apart, {{so that there are}} about 27,247 per mm2.|$|E

5|$|Odontocetes, such as {{the sperm}} whale, possess teeth with {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on the portion of <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum.

These grooves were only found {{on the sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> on <b>the</b> concave surfaces between the sides, as well on the back ridge of <b>the</b> <b>teeth.</b> Between 10 and 20µm wide, these grooves indicate that hair moved repeatedly across <b>the</b> <b>teeth.</b> Inside these grooves were even finer grooves, less than 1µm, created by abrasion with the cuticular layer of the hair.|$|R
5|$|The M2 {{is similar}} to that of eosimiids and almost {{identical}} to that of Afrotarsius libycus. It shows well-developed small accessory cusps (the paraconule and metaconule) that are connected to equally well-developed crests. The conules are stronger than in Eosimias and Bahinia, but weaker than in Phileosimias. The stylar shelf, the outer area of <b>the</b> <b>tooth,</b> is broad, particularly at the metacone cusp. However, the shelf is better developed near the paracone cusp in Afrasia than in Afrotarsius, which makes the ectoflexus (an invagination in the outer wall of <b>the</b> <b>tooth)</b> more symmetrical in the former. The parastyle, a small cusp in the outer front corner of <b>the</b> <b>tooth,</b> is located more buccally (towards the outer side of <b>the</b> <b>tooth)</b> than in Afrotarsius and is larger. The stylar shelf is larger than that of Bahinia and Phileosimias, but smaller than that of Eosimias. The parastyle is also less developed than in Eosimias, but the protocone, the main cusp on the lingual side of <b>the</b> <b>tooth,</b> is more expansive. The lingual cingulum is incomplete; it is stronger in Phenacopithecus.|$|E
5|$|The anteroconid on m1 (the frontmost cusp, {{corresponding}} to the anterocone) contains an internal hollow, an anteromedian fossettid. There is an ectolophid, an accessory crest in the valley between the protoconid (the cusp on the labial side, behind the anteroconid) and the hypoconid (the cusp behind the protoconid, at the back labial corner of <b>the</b> <b>tooth).</b> On {{the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>tooth,</b> the mesolophid (another accessory crest) is also present. On each of the lower molars, an anterolabial cingulum (a shelf on the front labial corner) is present. On m2 and m3, an anterolophid is present—a crest in front of the metaconid (the cusp on the front lingual corner of <b>the</b> <b>tooth).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{crown of}} <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> is {{triangular}} and contains six cusps, connected by low crests, that surround two prominent, low-lying fossae (basins) and a third, smaller fossa. Because {{of the complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues interpreted it as a molar; {{because of the number of}} roots, the arrangement of the cusps, and the shape of <b>the</b> <b>tooth,</b> as an upper molar; and because it tapers towards the end, as a last molar. One side, the longest, is flat and low compared to the others, suggesting it is the labial (outer) face. This would imply that <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> is from the left jaw. Under this interpretation, the length of <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> is 2.65mm, width is 2.20mm, height at the labial side is 1.05mm, and height at the lingual side is 1.30mm.|$|E
5000|$|A {{bridge is}} {{fabricated}} by reducing <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> {{on either side}} of <b>the</b> missing <b>tooth</b> or teeth by a preparation pattern determined by the location of <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> and by <b>the</b> material from which the bridge is fabricated. In other words, the abutment teeth—including portions which are otherwise perfectly healthy—are [...] "reduced" [...] in size using a high-speed rotary tool to accommodate the material to be used to restore {{the size and shape of}} <b>the</b> original <b>teeth</b> in a correct alignment and contact with <b>the</b> opposing <b>teeth.</b> <b>The</b> dimensions of the bridge are defined by Ante's Law: [...] "The root surface area of <b>the</b> abutment <b>teeth</b> has to equal or surpass that of <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> being replaced with pontics".|$|R

5|$|The fourth upper premolar (P4) {{has four}} main, {{transversely}} placed crests; {{the description of}} S.bolligeri mentions an additional, centrally placed small crest. De Bruijn interpreted the four main crests as the anteroloph, protoloph, metaloph, and posteroloph {{from front to back}} and wrote that these crests are not connected on the sides of <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b> Prieto and Böhme note that the posteroloph is convex on the back margin of <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b> In Muscardinus, the number of ridges on P4 ranges from five in Muscardinus sansaniensis to two in M.pliocaenicus and the living hazel dormouse, but the protoloph and metaloph are always connected on the lingual (inner) side of <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b> P4 is two-rooted in S.alpinus and three-rooted in S.bolligeri.|$|E
5|$|The gingiva ("gums") is the mucosal {{tissue that}} {{overlays}} the jaws. There are three {{different types of}} epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> and the mouth. The gingival epithelium is not associated directly with tooth attachment and is visible in the mouth. The junctional epithelium, composed of the basal lamina and hemidesmosomes, forms an attachment to <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b> The sulcular epithelium is nonkeratinized stratified squamous tissue on the gingiva which touches but is not attached to <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament becomes inflamed {{and there}} may be pain when biting or tapping on <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b> On an X-ray, bone resporption appears as a radiolucent area around the end of the root, although this does not manifest immediately. Acute apical periodontitis is characterized by well-localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate to severe pain. The alveolar process may be tender to palpation over the roots. <b>The</b> <b>tooth</b> may be raised in the socket and feel more prominent than the adjacent teeth.|$|E

50|$|The snout of Mauriciosaurus {{is round}} in {{cross-section}} and straight-sided. The {{bottom of the}} jaw is even, unlike Thililua where the jaw projects downwards {{at the level of}} the eye sockets. Each side of the upper jaw of Mauriciosaurus contain at least 42 teeth, including 4 in the premaxilla and 32 in the maxilla. All of <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> are of <b>the</b> same shape, being four times taller than they are wide with conical and recurved tips; <b>the</b> smallest <b>tooth,</b> from <b>the</b> back of the mouth, is about a quarter the size of the largest. The gaps separating <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> are a slightly wider than <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> themselves. While it is hard to infer much about the precise arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> in life, <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> of <b>the</b> upper and lower jaws probably would have been interlocking. Compared to other polycotylids, <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> are smaller than those of Eopolycotylus, Pahasapasaurus, and Georgiasaurus, and more numerous than those of Trinacromerum (30-38) or Dolichorhynchops (26-30).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> from <b>the</b> Moncure {{locality}} {{are similar}} to MNA V3680 in that they all have enclosed venom canals that open {{at the ends of}} <b>the</b> <b>teeth.</b> <b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> of U. schneideri can be distinguished from those of U. kroehleri by enclosure of the canals as well as a lesser degree of labiolingual compression.|$|R
5|$|The single known tooth, a third upper molar (M3) {{known as}} T Li 41, is tiny, with {{a length of}} 1.29mm and width of 1.82mm. Mein and Ginsburg claim {{that it is the}} {{smallest}} known prosimian molar. <b>The</b> <b>tooth</b> is triangular in shape and shows a simple, reduced morphology. Three important cusps—the protocone, paracone, and metacone—are present, connected by a crest. They are low and rounded. The metacone, located at the back of <b>the</b> <b>tooth,</b> is closer to the protocone, which is on the front lingual corner (the side of the tongue), than it is to the paracone on the front labial corner (the side of the cheeks). The protocone is rounded on the lingual side and is attached to a weak crest on the front and back. On the front labial corner, a lengthy crest, the parastylar crest, is present, which includes a minor cusp known as a parastyle. Some wear is visible on the parastylar crest, and at the front of <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> a contact facet with the preceding second upper molar is present. <b>The</b> <b>tooth</b> has a single, well-developed root, which contains a number of grooves, suggesting that it consists of three smaller, fused rootlets.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tooth</b> is {{recurved}} with {{a backward}} bend, and is oval in cross-section. Its {{front and back}} cutting edges are finely serrated, extending two-thirds down each edge. There are six denticles per millimeter (0.04in), and each denticle is square and chiseled. The overall form of <b>the</b> <b>tooth,</b> its width and shape in cross-section and its curvature resemble those in the maxilla (upper jawbone) and mandible of the species Dromaeosaurus albertensis from North America. Blood grooves are indistinct or absent, also similar to Dromaeosaurus, and differing {{from members of the}} Velociraptorinae subfamily. Dromaeosauroides differs from Dromaeosaurus in that the cutting edge at the front side is further from the middle of <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b> Although <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> is larger and the denticles similar, each denticle was smaller than those of Dromaeosaurus, which had only 13–20 denticles per , instead of Dromaeosauroides 30. The second known tooth is smaller——with the same features as the holotype.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} may {{be altered}} by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> {{is said to}} be impacted. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for <b>the</b> <b>tooth.</b> Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Tooth ankylosis occurs when <b>the</b> <b>tooth</b> has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} of braces moves <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> {{as a result}} of force and pressure on <b>the</b> <b>teeth.</b> There are traditionally four basic elements that are used: brackets, bonding material, arch wire, and ligature elastic (also called an “O-ring”). <b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> move when <b>the</b> arch wire puts pressure on <b>the</b> brackets and <b>teeth.</b> Sometimes springs or rubber bands are used to put more force in a specific direction.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> {{are another}} {{identifying}} characteristic of Anteosaurus. <b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> on <b>the</b> {{roof of the}} mouth are enlarged and confined in a cluster near <b>the</b> outer <b>tooth</b> row. <b>The</b> [...] "normal teeth" [...] include the anterior, canine and cheek teeth. A prominent feature of the dinocephalians is the ledge on <b>the</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> <b>The</b> canine <b>teeth</b> are big, and there are usually about ten cheek <b>teeth</b> present. <b>The</b> front of the mouth curves up due to the premaxillary bone of the upper jaw.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> of Rimasuchus are {{robust and}} blunt, unlike {{those of other}} crocodiles. They become more bulbous toward {{the rear of the}} jaws. The crowns of <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> are rarely sharp, {{although}} crown sharpness tends to lessen with size in crocodylians. <b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> are uniquely bicarinate, meaning that there are ridges on the front and back.|$|R
