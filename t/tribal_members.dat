5|$|On termination, the Menominee, {{which was}} one of the wealthiest tribes prior to termination, became one of the poorest. In 1954, the tribe's timber {{operations}} allowed it to be self-sufficient. The tribe, which owned utility companies, paid for a hospital, BIA salaries, local schools, and a stipend to <b>tribal</b> <b>members.</b> The tribe was forced to use its reserve funds to develop a termination plan that they did not want and instead of having a reserve, they entered into termination with a $300,000 deficit. Menominee County was created out of the old reservation boundaries and the tribe immediately had to finance its own police and fire protection. Without federal support and with no tax base, the situation became dire. The tribe closed the hospital, sold its utility company, and contracted those services to neighboring counties. The Menominee Enterprises, Inc., formed to care for the tribe's needs after termination, was unable to pay property taxes and began to consider selling off tribal property. Many Menominee <b>tribal</b> <b>members</b> believed that the sponsor of the termination bill, Senator Arthur Wilkins of Utah, intended to force the loss of rich tribal lands to non-Indians. In 1962, the state of Wisconsin took the position that the hunting and fishing rights were abrogated by the termination act and that the <b>tribal</b> <b>members</b> were subject to state hunting and fishing regulations. With the poverty in the former reservation, the loss of hunting rights meant the loss of one of their last remaining means of survival.|$|E

5|$|In 1962, <b>tribal</b> <b>members</b> Joseph L. Sanapaw, William J. Grignon, and Francis Basina {{were charged}} with violating state hunting and fishing regulations. All three {{admitted}} to the acts in open court, but claimed that the Wolf River Treaty gave {{them the right to}} hunt. The state trial court agreed and acquitted the three. The state was given leave to pursue a writ of error and appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court to answer whether the Termination Act canceled those rights retained by treaty.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Sac & Fox Nation, 508 U.S. 114 (1993), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States held that absent {{explicit}} congressional direction to the contrary, it must be presumed that a State does not have jurisdiction to tax <b>tribal</b> <b>members</b> who live and work in Indian country, whether the particular territory consists of a formal or informal reservation, allotted lands, or dependent Indian communities.|$|E
5|$|In the mid- to late-1940s, the Menominee tribe was {{considered}} {{by a government}} survey to identify tribes for termination, {{a process in which}} federal recognition of the tribe would be withdrawn and the tribe would no longer be dependent on the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to support them. The Menominee were thought to be a tribe that could be terminated because they were one of the richest tribes in the nation. The federal government thought that termination would allow the <b>tribal</b> <b>members</b> to be assimilated into mainstream American culture, becoming hard-working, tax-paying, productive citizens. In 1954, Congress terminated the federally recognized status of the tribe with the Menominee Indian Termination Act. According to the terms of the Termination Act, the federally recognized status was to end in 1958. The tribe and the state of Wisconsin successfully lobbied for a delay in the implementation of termination until 1961. The tribe was opposed to termination for a number of reasons; their concerns included the loss of tribal culture, the loss of land due to tax liens, the possibility of bankruptcy and loss of the tribal timber industry, and the lack of <b>tribal</b> <b>members</b> who were trained to run a county government. The state of Wisconsin was concerned that with no industry for the tribe to tax, the state would be responsible for the large financial outlay that would be required to maintain governmental operations for the former reservation.|$|E
5|$|The tribe {{sued the}} United States for {{compensation}} in the US Court of Claims, which ruled that <b>tribal</b> <b>members</b> still had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and that Congress had not abrogated the rights. The opposite rulings {{by the state and}} federal courts brought the issue to the Supreme Court. In 1968, the Supreme Court held that the tribe retained its hunting and fishing rights under the treaties involved and the rights were not lost after federal recognition was ended by the Menominee Indian Termination Act without a clear and unequivocal statement by Congress removing the rights.|$|E

5|$|Since 2008, the zoo {{has been}} {{lobbying}} for {{a permit to}} build an eagle sanctuary {{in order to be}} able to distribute the animals' feathers to <b>tribal</b> <b>members</b> for ceremonial purposes in accordance with federal law. Since the species are listed as endangered, any remains of dead animals are confiscated by the federal government and transported to a central repository in Colorado; members of Native American Indian nations then have to apply individually to receive parts, such as feathers, in a lengthy process with wait-times that can exceed several years. Since a tribally operated eagle sanctuary constitutes an exception to the process, it would be instrumental in strengthening Navajo cultural sovereignty; currently, only the Iowa and Zuni nations operate eagle sanctuaries for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|The Sunrise Dance Ceremony is not {{an ancient}} Yavapai ceremony. Apache and Yavapai often intermarried and adopted {{elements}} of each other's cultures; these two tribes reside together on the Camp Verde and Fort McDowell reservations. The Sunrise Dance is a four-day rite-of-transition for young Apache girls, which typically takes place from March through October. The sunrise dance is an ancient practice, unique to the Apache. It {{is related to the}} myth of the Changing Woman, a powerful figure in Apache culture who is believed to grant longevity. The power of Changing Woman is transferred to the pubescent girl through songs sung by the Medicine Man. A medicine man is joined by other <b>tribal</b> <b>members</b> in singing a series of songs, up to 32 which are believed to have first been sung by Changing Woman.|$|E
5|$|The tribes {{involved}} benefited {{greatly from}} the decision. Prior to Boldt's ruling, Indians collected {{less than five}} percent (5%) of the harvest, but by 1984, they were collecting forty-nine percent (49%). <b>Tribal</b> <b>members</b> became successful commercial fishermen, even expanding to marine fishing {{as far away as}} Alaska. The tribes became co-managers of the fisheries along with the state, hiring fish biologists and staff to carry out those duties. The Makah tribe, based on the terms of the Neah Bay Treaty and the Boldt decision, took their first California gray whale in over seventy years in 1999. Following a lawsuit by various animal rights activists, the tribe was allocated the right to take up to five whales a year for the 2001 and 2002 seasons.|$|E

5|$|Thirty-nine Native American tribal {{governments are}} based in Oklahoma, each holding limited powers within {{designated}} areas. While Indian reservations typical {{in most of the}} United States are not present in Oklahoma, tribal governments hold land granted during the Indian Territory era, but with limited jurisdiction and no control over state governing bodies such as municipalities and counties. Tribal governments are recognized by the United States as quasi-sovereign entities with executive, judicial, and legislative powers over <b>tribal</b> <b>members</b> and functions, but are subject to the authority of the United States Congress to revoke or withhold certain powers.
