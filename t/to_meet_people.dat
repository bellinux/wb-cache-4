MedSoc {{is run by a}} committee of third year medical students, and tradition dictates you must be in this year to be elected. As well as the free bar, we also organize bar crawls, and trips to other cities and countries. It is a great way <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>people</b> from all years.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to the {{tradition}} that {{the children of the}} imperial family should be separated from their parents and placed with private tutors, Crown Prince Akihito and his wife Crown Princess Michiko again broke precedent from the start by preferring to raise their children instead of entrusting them to the care of court chamberlains; the Crown Princess even breastfed. She and her husband have also built up a strong position among the general public, by their frequent trips in the 47 prefectures in the country <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>people</b> but also for the liberties taken by the imperial couple vis-a-vis the protocol. At a more formal level, the Crown Prince and Princess visited 37 foreign countries between 1959 and 1989.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, Winfrey and King decided to go on an 11-day road trip across America, from California to New York, 3,600 miles. They were excited <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>people</b> from small towns and see how America really lives. However, the initial {{excitement}} quickly wore off. The friends had minor meltdowns and fought for control over the radio; King likes to have music constantly playing while driving, Winfrey prefers silence. Despite {{the challenges of the}} road trip, they got to see the beauty of Sedona, meet the people of Navajo Nation, crash a couple of weddings, take a dip in the healing waters of Pagosa Springs, and learn about Amish culture. Winfrey's many driving anxieties and King's tone-deaf singing made the trip a huge hit with viewers.|$|E
500|$|The {{previous}} single from X, [...] "Talk", was {{a tribute}} to the German band Kraftwerk; similarly, [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] was intended by Coldplay to acknowledge American band R.E.M. When asked why the song paid {{a tribute to}} R.E.M.'s lead singer, Michael Stipe, Chris Martin said: [...] "I've lost all respect for fame, but I haven't lost all respect for respect. So the one great thing about being famous is that I get <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>people</b> who I respect. Our relationship is akin to a dog and its master. I'll always look up to him." [...] The band felt the track resembled R.E.M.'s 1991 single, [...] "Losing My Religion". [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] was left out of the album track list when the band sent an early version of X to their record label, Parlophone, but was included when the album was finalised.|$|E
500|$|Older fans of {{the show}} use the word [...] "brony", a {{portmanteau}} of the words [...] "bro" [...] and [...] "pony". Though this generally refers to male fans, the term is often applied to fans of either gender. Another term, [...] "Pegasister", {{has been used to}} refer to older female {{fans of the}} show. Two informal surveys of 2,300 and 9,000 participants respectively revealed that the average age of adult fans is around 21, that approximately 86% were male, and that 63% were currently pursuing a college degree or higher qualification. A subsequent 2013 survey with over 21,000 respondents showed similar numbers, and highlighted that the majority of fans were in the 15–30 age range, with the average age between 19 and 20, and over 65% were heterosexual. Further, using the Jungian personality test, the survey revealed that the largest fraction of respondents (approximately 27%) fell into the [...] "INTJ" [...] classification, which normally only occurs in 1–3% of the population, according to the surveyors. Many in the fandom who had difficulty in meeting others or being treated fairly by others found the fandom as a way <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>people</b> with similar interests and become more social. Hub Network's CEO and President Margaret Loesch, who was the executive producer of the 1980s and 1990s animated My Little Pony television shows, noted that there were male fans of those past shows, but there are considerably more for Friendship Is Magic due {{to the quality of the}} show and the influence of social media and the Internet.|$|E
