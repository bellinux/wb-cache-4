5|$|In the Malay Seri Rama and the Indonesian-Javanese Rama Keling, Ravana {{wants to}} possess Mandodari, {{the mother of}} Rama, but instead marries a pseudo-Mandodari, who looks like <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>one.</b> Rama's father has a union with this pseudo-Mandodari, {{resulting}} in the birth of Sita, who is nominally Ravana's daughter.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Jacques realizes {{his brother}} is in trouble, and calls Johnson for help. When Johnson leaves, his abused wife Shelley (Mädchen Amick) hides {{a gun in}} a secret drawer. Meanwhile, sawmill owner Josie Packard (Joan Chen) tells Truman, her lover, that her {{sister-in-law}} Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) is scheming {{to take over the}} mill. Packard knows there are two account books, one fake and one real, but cannot locate <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>one</b> Martell has been hiding.|$|E
5|$|At Survivor Series, Kane {{tried to}} get Edge to bring Paul Bearer out to them but Edge brought out an empty wheelchair. Kane tried to {{interrogate}} Edge during their fight but in the end, Edge unknowingly double pinned his rival, keeping Kane as World Heavyweight Champion before wheeling Kane into a barricade. On November 26, Edge was offered {{a chance at a}} rematch with Kane for the title if we would let Bearer go free. But Edge did not keep his word. At the end of the night, Edge lured Kane outside and drove over a dummy of Paul Bearer before driving off with <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>one</b> again.|$|E

5|$|In some {{adaptations of}} the Ramayana, other {{characters}} also use surrogates to save themselves from Ravana. A Tamil text narrates how Ravana once asks for Parvati as boon {{from her husband}} Shiva, however Vishnu – disguised as a sage – deludes Ravana into believing Shiva granted him an illusionary Parvati. Ravana entrusts Parvati to Vishnu and mediates again to compel Shiva {{to give him the}} real Parvati. This time, Shiva gives an illusionary Parvati, which he accepts as <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>one</b> and returns to Lanka with her. In the Malay Ramayana, Ravana sets his eyes on Rama's mother, however she transforms a frog into her image and sends this surrogate to be Ravana's wife.|$|E
5|$|Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) {{has been}} taken to a disused medical {{facility}} by David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) and his agents. She {{is placed in the}} same room along with Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), also secured to a chair, revealing she was also abducted by Jones the night before. Jones arrives and asserts that Olivia has great abilities due to her Cortexiphan doping but he must coax them out of Olivia. He presents a light box test that Olivia should be able to activate with her mind, torturing Nina to create the emotional driver, but Olivia admits she can't do it without rest. During this period, Olivia, her memories a mix of her own and that of Olivia from Peter Bishop's (Joshua Jackson) timeline, asks Nina to help her make an emotional connection, but she recognizes that this Nina is not <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>one</b> but instead the one from the parallel universe. Olivia continues to play along, explaining to Nina that her Cortexiphan abilities could only be induced by being near Peter; Nina fakes illness to be extracted from the room, where she explains to a complicit Jones that they need to abduct Peter.|$|E
25|$|Mir Jafar and the Seths desired {{that the}} confederacy between the British and himself {{be kept secret}} from Omichund, but {{when he found out}} about it, he {{threatened}} to betray the conspiracy if his share was not increased to three million rupees (£300,000). Hearing of this, Clive suggested an expedient to the Committee. He suggested that two treaties be drawn – <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>one</b> on white paper, containing no reference to Omichund and the other on red paper, containing Omichund’s desired stipulation, to deceive him. The Members of the Committee signed on both treaties, but Admiral Watson signed only <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>one</b> and his signature had to be counterfeited on the fictitious one. Both treaties and separate articles for donations to the army, navy squadron and committee were signed by Mir Jafar on 4 June.|$|E

More than half of the students (59%) chose the fake assessment as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1707, Apostolo Zeno and Pietro Pariati wrote a {{libretto}} entitled Flavio Anicio Olibrio.

25|$|From {{one of his}} {{experiments}} emerged the Cyber Series – artificial humanoids possessing superhuman {{strength and}} agility. But something was amiss: The 5000 original Cybers, engineered {{to be the perfect}} servants, mimicked human emotions too closely, displaying free will of their own. When they disobey orders from Reichter, he orders all of the Cyber Series to be destroyed. After Cyber-29 died falling from a cliff, Reichter transfers his brain into the body of a panther and names him Data-7. Cyber-6 was the only true Cyber to survive the massacre, escaping {{with the help of a}} black slave who hid her away in a fishing village. When Reichter interrogates to kill the slave, Cybersix arrives at the city of Meridiana, where she battles Reichter and his minions, and disguises herself as fellow teacher Adrian Seidelman after <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>one</b> is killed in a car wreck.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{revealed}} that the Scarlet Witch seen in Wundagore Mountain is actually a Doctor Doombot which apparently means that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>one</b> has been captured by Doom sometime after the House of M event. It is revealed that Wanda's enhanced powers were {{a result of her}} and Doom's combined attempt to channel the Life Force in order to resurrect her children. This proves to be too much for Wanda to contain and it overtook her. With Wiccan and Doom's help, they seek to use the entity that is possessing Wanda to restore the powers of mutantkinds. This is stopped by the Young Avengers (who are concerned at the fall-out that would ensue if the powerless mutants are suddenly re-powered) only to find out that Doom intended to transfer the entity into his own body and gain Wanda's god-like powers of re-writing reality for himself. Doom becomes omnipotent with powers surpassing those of beings as the Beyonder or the Cosmic Cube. The Young Avengers confront him, but Doom accidentally kills Cassie just before Wanda and Wiccan stole his new-found powers.|$|E
25|$|Luke is {{revealed}} to be keeping secret that the drug therapy is only a temporary solution, and Laura will eventually return to her catatonic state. Lulu is able to convince her cousin Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright) to postpone her marriage to Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher), allowing her parents to use the supplies already in place. On November 16, 2006, Luke and Laura remarry on their 25th wedding anniversary. A drunken Tracy has {{to be removed from}} the ceremony, and scheming Maxie manages to sneak into the ceremony and catch Laura's bouquet, much like Scott had 25 years before. On November 20, Luke reveals that Laura's illness is no longer mental but physical and she will soon revert to her catatonic state. Laura decides she wants an early Christmas as she may not be around for <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>one,</b> and is able to comfort Lulu when she reveals the truth about her abortion. When Luke arrives with the tree, Laura is confused, confirming that her catatonia is returning. After being escorted back to the asylum, Laura reveals to her daughter that she doesn't think she really killed Rick Webber and asks her to prove her innocence. After saying goodbye to her family, Laura returns to her chair and sits with Luke as he tearfully watches her slip back into silence.|$|E

25|$|Faced by {{a period}} of bad weather {{endangering}} the harvest during one early spring, King Numa resorted to the scheme of asking {{the advice of the}} god by evoking his presence. He succeeded through the help of Picus and Faunus, whom he had imprisoned by making them drunk. The two gods (with a charm) evoked Jupiter, who was forced to come down to earth at the Aventine (hence named Iuppiter Elicius, according to Ovid). After Numa skilfully avoided the requests of the god for human sacrifices, Jupiter agreed to his request to know how lightning bolts are averted, asking only for the substitutions Numa had mentioned: an onion bulb, hairs and a fish. Moreover, Jupiter promised that at the sunrise of the following day he would give to Numa and the Roman people pawns of the imperium. The following day, after throwing three lightning bolts across a clear sky, Jupiter sent down from heaven a shield. Since this shield had no angles, Numa named it ancile; because in it resided the fate of the imperium, he had many copies made of it to disguise <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>one.</b> He asked the smith Mamurius Veturius to make the copies, and gave them to the Salii. As his only reward, Mamurius expressed the wish that his name be sung in the last of their carmina. Plutarch gives a slightly different version of the story, writing that the cause of the miraculous drop of the shield was a plague and not linking it with the Roman imperium.|$|E
25|$|In {{the main}} event cage match wrestlers could escape the cage and thus unmasking only by {{climbing}} {{over the top of}} the cage and all the way to the floor. The first escapee was Coco Armarillo who climbed over the top within minutes of the opening bell. When Máscara Sagrada Jr. tried to escape the Killer, <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>one</b> this time, climbed up the cage from the outside and pushed Máscara Sagrada Jr. off the top of the cage, back inside the ring. A few minutes later Coco Azul was able to leave the cage as well, leaving his two partners at a four-on-two disadvantage in the cage. During the match Máscara Sagrada tried to even the sides as he tried to prevent the Killer from interfering on several occasions. When Tinieblas Jr. climbed the cage the Killer tried to stop him as he had done before, but this time Tinieblas Jr. was able to knock Killer down and become the third man to leave the cage, moments later Máscara Sagrada Jr. also left the cage. At this point Lady Victoria, who was siding with Los Payasos and Karis locked Miss Janeth to the cage with a pair of handcuffs. Blue Demon Jr. managed to kick a chair into the face of Karis La Momia and then use the break in the action to climb {{over the top of the}} cage to the floor. When the match came down to Karis La Momia and Halcón Dorado Jr. Máscarita Sagráda Jr. ran to ringside to help his regular-sized friends out, helping unlock the handcuffs used on Miss Janeth. Looking to help out the diminutive Mini-Estrella climbed up the outside of the cage and dove off the top. He intended to hit Karis La Momia, but at the last moment Karis moved and Máscarita Sagráda Jr. landed on Halcón Dorado Jr. instead. Karis use the opening to handcuff Máscarita Sagráda Jr. to Halcón Dorado Jr., then began to climb the cage, when Halcón Dorado Jr. tried to stop him he was slowed down by the fact that he was dragging Máscarita Sagráda Jr. behind him, making him too late to stop Karis from leaving the cage. After the match a frustrated Halcón Dorado Jr. revealed that his real name was Antonio Olmos, then angrily pulled his mask off and attacked Máscarita Sagráda Jr. and Máscara Sagráda Jr. blaming them for his mask loss.|$|E

500|$|The Ananda Ramayana {{does have}} the Maya Sita, who is kidnapped by Ravana, but has an illusory Sita called rajatamomayi chaya ("shadow of Rajas and Tamas elements") of Sita, who is {{abandoned}} by Rama while the sattva-rupa ("sattva form") – the real Sita – [...] remains unseen by her husband's left side, the traditional place of a Hindu wife. Kamban's Ramavataram (12th century) narrates that Shurpanakha – the sister of Ravana – impersonates Sita to seduce Rama, but her trickery is exposed by him. In a 14th-century Nepalese drama, Shurpanakha disguises as Sita, but Rama is fooled by her appearance. When real Sita also appears, Rama is perplexed. However, Lakshmana tests the two Sitas and rightly judges <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>one.</b> The Ramcharitmanas narrates that the goddess Sati, wife of the god Shiva, tries to test Rama by appearing before him disguised as Sita when he is searching for his kidnapped wife. However, Rama sees through her disguise; Shiva abandons her, angry with her action.|$|E
