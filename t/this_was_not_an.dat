5|$|The 6th Airborne Division, {{now with}} the commandos of the 1st Special Service Brigade under command, had to defend the Orne bridgehead. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> easy task as it had to face {{elements}} of the 21st Panzer Division {{from the south and}} the 346th and 711th Infantry Divisions from the east.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{advancement}} of his legal career had been hindered by his marriage to Jane, Hogg hoped to receive a legal appointment from a politically connected acquaintance. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> immediate option because the Whig party was in opposition, but {{in the summer of}} 1827 Henry Brougham promised Hogg a future position as a professor of civil law at the newly created University College London. Hogg embarked on a course of study in preparation, but the professorship was not established owing to a lack of funds. This setback upset Hogg greatly, and he became very bitter about it. A lecture that he had intended to give at his inauguration was published in 1831.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} goods {{produced}} indigenously, {{it was estimated}} that due to the inability of traditional suppliers to deliver manufactured goods because of trade embargoes and shipping shortages up to 400 new articles were produced in Australian factories {{as a result of the}} war. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> insignificant number, although the transformation of the Australian economy as a result of World War I was by no means as significant as that which occurred during World War II. The expansion of the steel industry that occurred during this time laid the foundation for future industrialisation.|$|E

5|$|Marx's {{thoughts}} on labour {{were related to}} the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism). Accumulation of capital shapes the social system. For Marx, social change was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces. This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory. In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx noted that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{argued that}} the Federal Circuit's {{decision}} was correct because Bowman had created a new product that infringed on their patent.

The Supreme Court requested the United States to brief the Court, and the Solicitor General filed a brief generally {{in support of the}} Monsanto position. The United States asked the Court to deny certiorari. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 5, 2012.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade {{varied in}} size and {{structure}} each time it was created. Headquarters and Service Company, the company comprising the headquarters staff and support personnel, was {{much smaller than the}} equivalent company in standard Marine brigades. Each iteration of the brigade was assigned provisional military police, signal and other supporting companies and platoons. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> uncommon practice for the U.S. Marine Corps, which created such ad hoc units regularly in wartime. During World War II two other provisional Marine brigades were formed, which eventually expanded into divisions.|$|E

Since making their competitive bow, San Marino have competed in qualifying for every European Championships and World Cup, but have never won a match in either competition.

5|$|Following the American attack, Komori {{pulled his}} {{remaining}} {{force back to}} defend the airstrip. As <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> Allied objective, the Japanese were not subjected to further attacks by ground troops other than occasional patrol clashes and ambushes. As {{a result of the}} supply shortages, many of the Japanese soldiers fell sick. Attempts to bring supplies in by sea from Gasmata were disrupted by U.S.Navy PT boats and the force lacked enough porters to supply itself through overland trails. Komori concluded that his force was serving no purpose, and on 8February informed his superiors that it faced destruction due to supply shortages. They responded by ordering Komori to hold his positions, though his force was awarded two Imperial citations in recognition of its supposed success in defending the airstrip.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> {{encouraging}} {{start for}} the operation but despite this, the LCS decided {{to continue with the}} deception. Colonel Thornton's trip was approved and he travelled to Stockholm toward the end of April. Thornton spent two weeks in Sweden, meeting {{with the head of the}} Royal Swedish Air Force, General Bengt Nordenskiöld. The conferences were treated with a high degree of secrecy in the hope this would emphasise their importance. It had the required effect; Thornton's conversations were recorded by a pro-German chief of police and forwarded to Germany. Despite siding with the Allies, Nordenskiöld communicated very little sensitive information to Thornton. Nordenskiöld was convinced that the Allies intended to invade Norway, but he kept this conviction to himself, contrary to Allied hopes. Thornton returned to England on 30 April.|$|E

5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company's {{status was}} bolstered {{when it became}} one of the first 12 {{companies}} to be listed on the inaugural Dow Jones Industrial Average, compiled in May 1896. However, it was not long before TCI was eclipsed by its principal competitor, the United States Steel Corporation, a huge conglomerate formed in 1901 out of the enormous Carnegie and Federal steel empires. By the time of the Panic of 1907, U. S. Steel felt confident enough to launch a takeover bid of its Southern rival. On the morning of Saturday November 2, banker and tycoon J. P. Morgan, one of the founders of U. S. Steel, convened a meeting in his library and there suggested that U. S. Steel purchase the stock of an insolvent Wall Street brokerage firm, Moore and Schley, which had secured huge loans against 6 million TCI shares. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> entirely selfish gesture, as Morgan recognised that the failure of Moore and Schley would send investor confidence in the markets into a nose-dive. E. H. Gary, president of U. S. Steel, agreed in principle to this transaction, yet argued that without careful political maneuvering the deal would be seen by Congress as an effort to create a monopoly and thereby encounter troublesome federal anti-trust litigation. Morgan himself had been burnt by crusading Washington trust-busters in 1902 when his Northern Securities Company had been forcibly broken up by the government in a landmark test case.|$|E
