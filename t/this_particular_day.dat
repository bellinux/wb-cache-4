He only had 16 ships, which were all that he could enlist and equip, but were, apparently, the largest available at the time, giving him a certain advantage over the 25 French ships. As it was 25 July, the Festivity of St. James, Patrón de España, Bazán harangued his troops {{by pointing out that}} it was impossible for the Spanish to lose a battle on <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day.</b> The Spanish troops attacked with such a raging fervour, that the French, were overwhelmed in a short time.|$|E

25|$|When {{he reached}} puberty, Dahmer {{discovered}} that he was homosexual. He did not divulge his sexual orientation to his parents, although in his early teens, he did engage in a brief relationship with another youth, although the pair never had intercourse. By his later admission, {{as he began to}} fantasize sexually, issues of dominance and control over a completely subservient partner were prevalent in his thoughts. These thoughts gradually became intertwined with dissection. On one occasion, when he was approximately 16 years old, Dahmer conceived a rape fantasy of rendering a particular male jogger he found attractive unconscious and then making sexual use of his unconscious body. To render the man unconscious, Dahmer concealed himself in bushes on the route he had noted the jogger took, baseball bat in hand, and lay in wait for the jogger. On <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day,</b> the jogger did not pass him and, although Dahmer never attempted to implement this plan again, he later stated this was his first attempt to attack another individual.|$|E

He shared ownership with William Radford, Esq. who owned a two-eighth interest. Captain John Tallman, the captain of the Henry Clay for <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day's</b> run, owned a one-eighth interest.

2500|$|In the morning, Moses {{relates to}} Aaron that God {{has a message}} for him, while deferring its revelation to a later time. [...] However, <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day,</b> Moses changes {{the order in which}} the priests and dignitaries walk to the Tent of Meeting, placing Aaron in the center {{position}} of honor, much to the delight of the people. [...] Still, he does not explain to Aaron the reason for the change, nor can he later explain the matter to Aaron when they and Eleazar walk together to the mountain. [...] Moses tries in a gently elliptical manner to explain to Aaron that the latter's death is at hand, asking hypothetically whether [...] Aaron was loaned something from God which God might now want returned; however, Aaron does not perceive Moses's meaning.|$|E

50|$|This is an {{essentially}} agricultural area, although {{the west is}} wooded.

6000|$|Then {{the thing}} happened. A little thing, {{it could only}} be traced back to first causes: perhaps the lieutenant's breakfast had not agreed with him; or he had been up late the night before; or his debts were pressing; or the {{commander}} had spoken brusquely to him. The point is, that on <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>day</b> the lieutenant was irritable. The sailor, with others, was [...] "setting up" [...] the fore rigging.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 October 2009, May wrote a fanclub {{letter on}} his website stating that Queen had no {{intentions}} to tour in 2010 {{but that there}} was a possibility of a performance. He was quoted as saying, [...] "The greatest debate, though, is always about when we will next play together as Queen. At the moment, in spite of the many rumours that are out there, we do not have plans to tour in 2010. The good news, though, is that Roger and I have a much closer mutual understanding these days—privately and professionally ... and all ideas are carefully considered. Music is never far away from us. As I write, there is an important one-off performance on offer, in the USA, and it remains to be decided whether we will take up <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> challenge. Every <b>day,</b> doors seem to open, and every day, we interact, perhaps more than ever before, with the world outside. It is a time of exciting transition in Rock music and in 'The Business'. It's good that the pulse still beats". On 15 November 2009, May and Taylor performed [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] live on the British TV show The X Factor alongside the finalists.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Gascoigne {{felt that}} he had come to a {{satisfactory}} understanding with his niece, and had furthered her happy settlement in life by furthering her engagement to Grandcourt.
