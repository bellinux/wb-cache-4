5|$|One of Piłsudski's main goals was to {{transform}} the parliamentary system into a presidential system; however, he opposed the introduction of <b>totalitarianism.</b> The adoption of a new Polish constitution in April 1935, tailored by Piłsudski's supporters to his specifications — providing for a strong presidency — came too late for Piłsudski to seek that office; but the April Constitution would serve Poland up to the outbreak of World War II and would carry its Government in Exile {{through to the end}} of the war and beyond.|$|E
5|$|Samora Machel became Mozambique's first president. The Reverend Uria Simango, his wife, {{and other}} FRELIMO dissidents {{were arrested in}} 1975 and {{detained}} without trial. Within about two years, fighting resumed with the Mozambican Civil War against RENAMO insurgents plied with Rhodesian and South African military support. Industrial and social recession, Marxist-style <b>totalitarianism,</b> corruption, poverty, inequality and failed central planning eroded the initial revolutionary fervour. Peace returned only in 1992, when the nation achieved relative stability {{for the first time}} in several decades.|$|E

50|$|Berman {{tries to}} trace the {{influence}} of these European movements upon the modern Muslim world. He identifies two principal totalitarian tendencies in the Muslim countries, Baathism and radical Islamism - mutually hostile movements whose doctrines, in his interpretation, overlap and have allowed for alliances. Berman regards suicide terror and the cult of martyrdom as a re-emergence of <b>totalitarianism's</b> nihilist strand.|$|R
5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} {{conspiracy}} theorists grossly overestimate {{the influence of}} ex-Nazis and neo-Nazis on American society, and point out that political repression at home and imperialism abroad {{have a long history}} in the United States that predates the 20th century. Some political scientists, such as Sheldon Wolin, have expressed concern that the twin forces of democratic deficit and superpower status have paved the way in the U.S. for the emergence of an inverted <b>totalitarianism</b> which contradicts many principles of Nazism.|$|E
5|$|ACLU {{leadership}} was split {{on whether to}} purge its leadership of communists. Norman Thomas, John Haynes Holmes, and Morris Ernst were anti-communists who wanted to distance the ACLU from communism; opposing them were Harry Ward, Corliss Lamont and Elizabeth Flynn who rejected any political test for ACLU leadership. A bitter struggle ensued throughout 1939, and the anti-communists prevailed in February 1940, when the board voted to prohibit anyone who supported <b>totalitarianism</b> from ACLU leadership roles. Chairman Harry Ward immediately resigned, andfollowing a contentious six-hour debateElizabeth Flynn was voted off the ACLU's board. The 1940 resolution was {{considered by many to}} be a betrayal of its fundamental principles. The resolution was rescinded in 1968, and Flynn was posthumously reinstated to the ACLU in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Döblin's 1924 {{science fiction}} novel recounts {{the course of}} human history from the 20th to the 27th century, portraying it as a catastrophic global {{struggle}} between technological mania, natural forces, and competing political visions. Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) presciently invokes such topics as urbanization, the alienation from nature, ecological devastation, mechanization, the dehumanization of the modern world, as well as mass migration, globalization, <b>totalitarianism,</b> fanaticism, terrorism, state surveillance, genetic engineering, synthetic food, the breeding of humans, biochemical warfare, and others. Stylistically and structurally experimental, it {{was regarded as a}} difficult work when it first came out and has often polarized critics. Among others, Günter Grass has praised the novel's continued relevance and insight.|$|E
50|$|Popper {{argued that}} the ideas of individuality, criticism, and humanitarianism cannot be {{suppressed}} once people have become aware of them, and therefore {{that it is impossible}} to return to the closed society, but at the same time recognized the continuing emotional pull of what he called “the lost group spirit of tribalism”, as manifested for example in the <b>totalitarianisms</b> of the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|In totalitarian regimes (especially in Hitler’s Germany), {{the control}} of art and other {{cultural}} expressions {{was an integral part}} of the establishment of power. It reflects <b>totalitarianism’s</b> aim to control every single aspect of society and the individuals’ lives. However, art and culture had a special importance for at least two reasons: they have the power to influence people, and they embody the identity of a nation, a community, a group of people.|$|R
40|$|The interwar {{period was}} a moment of deep crisis everywhere. The already strong shock of World War I, a {{conflict}} that involved different continents with political and economic consequences, was soon followed by the 1929 crisis and by the growth of <b>totalitarianisms.</b> The United States of America, which had previously abandoned the principle of isolationism to join the war, quickly returned to it, rejecting Wilsonian idealism.

5|$|In 1939, the Department of Justice {{created the}} Civil Rights Section, which focused {{primarily}} on First Amendment and labor rights. The increasing scrutiny of <b>totalitarianism</b> in the lead-up to World War II brought increased attention to issues of slavery and involuntary servitude, abroad and at home. The U.S. sought to counter foreign propaganda and increase its credibility on the race issue by combatting the Southern peonage system. Under the leadership of Attorney General Francis Biddle, the Civil Rights Section invoked the constitutional amendments and legislation of the Reconstruction Era {{as the basis for}} its actions.|$|E
5|$|In English, {{the term}} 'guinea pig' is {{commonly}} used {{as a metaphor for}} a subject of scientific experimentation, or any experiment or test in modern times. This dates back to the early 20th century; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913. In 1933, Consumers Research founders F. J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs, extending the metaphor to consumer society. The book became a national bestseller in the United States, thus further popularizing the term, and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement. The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs by Czech author Ludvík Vaculík as an allegory for Soviet <b>totalitarianism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Interviews with {{communities}} {{from both}} sides of the political divide indicate how Chávez is seen by the rich and poor. The latter support his stated aim to redistribute the country's oil wealth; the former fear <b>totalitarianism</b> and are worried Chávez will institute communism. In February 2002, the media war intensifies after Chavez takes control of PDVSA. The film states that the company was previously run as a private interest for the benefit of a minority, despite being state-owned. Business leader Pedro Carmona and union boss Carlos Ortega are the main voices of the opposition. After the pair visit Washington, D.C., the CIA and the State Department express concern about Chávez's rule and stress the importance of Venezuela's oil. A Venezuelan general appears on private television to voice similar disquiet. Carmona appeals for a public protest at the offices of PDVSA.|$|E
50|$|When {{political}} repression is sanctioned {{and organized}} by the state, situations of state terrorism, genocide and crime against humanity can be reached. Systematic and violent political repression is a typical feature of dictatorships, <b>totalitarianisms</b> and similar regimes. In these regimes, acts of political repression {{can be carried out}} by the police and secret police, the army, paramilitary groups and death squads. Sometimes regimes considered democratic exercise political repression and state terrorism to other states as part of their security policy.|$|R
50|$|In fact, he was {{consistently}} suspicious of anything {{claiming to be}} a solution to an old political or philosophical problem. He spoke of the danger in trying finally to resolve the debate between rationalism and traditionalism in politics. In particular, along with many in the pre-World War II German Right, he feared people trying to force a world state to come into being in the future, thinking that it would inevitably become a tyranny. Hence he kept his distance from the <b>totalitarianisms</b> of his century, the right-wing fascists and the left-wing communists.|$|R

5|$|The FPÖ is a {{descendant}} of the pan-German and national liberal camp (Lager) {{dating back to the}} Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas. During the interwar era, the national liberal camp (gathered in the Greater German People's Party) fought against the mutually-hostile Christian Social and Marxist camps in their struggles to structure the new republic according to their respective ideologies. After a short civil war, the Federal State of Austria, an authoritarian Christian Social dictatorship, was established in 1934. By 1938, with the Anschluss of Austria into Nazi Germany, the national liberal camp (which had always striven for an inclusion of Austria into a Greater Germany) had been swallowed whole by Austrian National Socialism and all other parties were eventually absorbed into Nazi <b>totalitarianism.</b> Both Socialists and Christian Socials were persecuted under the Nazi regime, and the national liberal camp was scarred after the war due to guilt by association with National Socialism.|$|E
5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten presciently invokes {{such topics}} as world war, urbanization, the {{alienation}} from nature, mechanization, the dehumanization of the modern world, as well as mass migration, globalization, <b>totalitarianism,</b> fanaticism, terrorism, state surveillance, genetic engineering, synthetic food, the breeding of humans, biochemical warfare, and others. Döblin's experiences during the First World War, when he served in Alsace as a military doctor, left their mark on the novel: psychically damaged veterans, devastated landscapes, and all-destructive technological excesses give this novel its particularly apocalyptic feeling. Because of the bleak {{vision of the future}} that the novel presents, it has often been described by critics as a fundamentally pessimistic, irrationalistic, or regressive work. Hannelore Qual argues against this that Berge Meere und Giganten is instead characterized by an optimistic view of social and historical perfectibility; the portrayals of catastrophic destruction and brutally authoritarian regimes reflect, in this reading, not Döblin's own world view but instead different historical possibilities, alongside which more egalitarian and peaceful social orders are to be found.|$|E
5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, and I hoped that it would attract more attention than it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both of Marx and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of <b>totalitarianism</b> are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E
40|$|Voting {{procedures}} nowadays are anachronistic on two counts: {{the technology}} of recording and counting votes often is outmoded and too much is expected from the mechanisms of democratic choice. Even if votes always and everywhere were counted perfectly, election outcomes would still be arbitrary since no collective choice process can divine the “general will”. The crucial line in any state is the one dividing private decisions from collective decisions. Democracy {{is part of the}} package for nations freeing themselves from <b>totalitarianism’s</b> grip, but it may be the last, rather than the first thing that should be added to the mix.

The film stages a society based on social engineering that has itsorigin in the dream of purity and innocence of an individual who is unable to withstand the pain and violence human lifeentails.

If it took place at all, the {{speakers}} would have solemnly examined the grotesque crypto-constitutions of an assortment of <b>totalitarianisms</b> and authoritarianisms with a mixture of scientific detachment and juridical respect owed to sovereign efforts at political and economic self-determination. Consider how radically things have changed. In the contemporary international arena, citizens of one national community may concern themselves with, appraise, and even intervene in the crafting and maintenance of constitutions in other communities. The core constitutional principles of national communities are now legitimate matters of international concern...|$|R

It points out the status and role of religion in the society and compares the current secularization tendencies in Western Europe against the role of traditions in American society determined by civil religion. The study maps the influence of enlightenment on the forming of democracies, then the <b>totalitarianisms</b> of the 20 th century and both the secularization and de-secularization in the last decades. It analyses the discussion about the role of values and civil society in secularized Europe.

40|$|In {{the article}} I shall, on {{the example of}} the European poet and {{translator}} Alojz Gradnik (1882 – 1967), shed light on the impact of multiculturalism, multilingualism and ideological dichotomy on literary production and literary reception. Gradnik himself was in fact multicultural and multilingual, which was, however, unacceptable in his lifetime due to the specific social and political context. Gradnik thus gave up the multicultural and multilingual dimension. But due to this very element that he had denied himself, he was split within himself, which was reflected in his literary production; that is, in his poetry as well as in his translations of literary works. On the other hand, the image of Gradnik as a multicultural and multilingual author was exploited by the European <b>totalitarianisms,</b> therefore Gradnik as an author suffered a paradoxical fate...|$|R
40|$|The Eastern {{enlargement}} of the European Union has intensified calls for the reconstruction of a common European remembrance of the continent's multiple totalitarian legacies. Various political initiatives to condemn, along with counter-attempts to re-legitimize, the legacy of communism have emerged at the pan-European level. Each aspires to leave an imprint on the symbolic moral order and the legal regime of the broader European community. This article builds a conceptual framework for understanding the contestation of political and juridical regulation of the transnational remembrance of totalitarian communist regimes in Europe. Critically engaging the concept of cosmopolitanization of memory, {{it is argued that}} mnemonic identity in Europe is being transformed via new claims on “European memory. ” These claims are being made by various East European actors seeking recognition of the region's particular historical legacies as part of the pan-European normative verdict on twentieth-century <b>totalitarianisms...</b>|$|R

50|$|By 1985, the government's {{impotence}} prompted Congress to call early elections, {{citing the}} fact that Siles had been originally elected five years before. Having broken with Siles, the MIR this time ran on its own, led by the ubiquitous Paz as its presidential candidate. Paz finished a respectable third, and the MNR's Víctor Paz Estenssoro was elected president (1985-89). During the 1985-1989 period, the MIR underwent major ideologicl transformations, with Paz and Oscar Eid advocating a break with Marxist notions and with any call for class-based struggle. These were the days of Perestroika, and the handwriting {{seemed to be on}} the wall (so to speak) for the Eastern European <b>totalitarianisms.</b> The MIR's programmatic shift entailed some major defections (most notable of which was that of Antonio Araníbar), but at least the party emerged more united and cohesive than it had been. It also had increased its electoral appeal considerably.|$|R
40|$|For most thinkers the 20 th century {{represented}} {{a time of}} sudden breaks and unprecedented violence, through its sequence of wars, <b>totalitarianisms</b> and genocides. Those events deeply changed the way evil is understood, mainly due to reflections that could explain how {{the significance of the}} crimes committed could not correspond to the individual intentions that caused them. This paper deepens the contribution given by Günther Anders to the topic of evil through the technocratic paradigm. Exploring the roots of atrocious actions and establishing meaningful connections among them through technology, his thought got to the discrepancy between productive omnipotence and impotence of emotions in figuring out both goals and effects of the products. His philosophy of discrepancy not only is a diagnosis of the roots of evil, {{but it is also a}} starting point to re-think the active role of emotions in the contemporary dimension of politics...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} dystopian imaginaries {{of the recent}} popular novel trilogy The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and its film adaptations. Having put the {{narrative}} into a genealogy of dystopian fiction concerned with the historical nation-state <b>totalitarianisms,</b> I ask what is specifically contemporary about The Hunger Games. I explore this {{by focusing on the}} functioning of the reality show format in the narrative, which I link to G. Agamben’s understanding of the spectacle, as part of his wider biopolitical theories. I apply an Agambenian biopolitical reading to the narrative, seeing it as a production of bare life through the camp of the reality show arena. I suggest that The Hunger Games offer a critique of contemporary liberal democracies by calling attention to their production of underclassed and expendable life, which is imagined as an eruption of the nation-state right to kill, similarly as in Agamben’s theories. </p...|$|R
