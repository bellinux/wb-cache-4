He was the first Soviet official (discounting Soviet intelligence officers) to visit Cuba after the revolution, and secured important trade agreements with the new government. He left Cuba with a very positive impression, saying that the atmosphere there made him feel [...] "as <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> returned to my childhood." ...|$|E

He was a keen sportsman {{there and}} was appointed huntsman to the Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt, the world's oldest cross-country running club. He continued {{his interest in}} sports after earning an exhibition to Christ Church, Oxford in 1887 and became a Blue, representing the university in various running events over several years. He {{became president of the}} Oxford University Athletics Club and played association football, rugby union and cricket at college level. J. B. Atkins, who competed against him for the Cambridge University athletics team, said: [...] "With his stately height and gigantic stride, he was magnificent in action; his final effort, always, triumphant, when he saw the goal of all, the tape, waiting for him, was a sight never to be forgotten– <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a strong reason for regretting it at the time." [...] His exhibition was superseded by a scholarship but he was not academically successful, managing only a third-class degree.|$|E

The {{graffiti}} art featuring Homer's {{face and the}} word [...] "dope" [...] that Bart creates in the episode is a reference to Fairey's Barack Obama [...] "Hope" [...] poster and his OBEY Giant image. Fairey has said that The Simpsons {{has been one of}} his favorite television shows since the early 1990s because of its [...] "blend of humor and social commentary", and he felt [...] "deeply honored" [...] to be included in an episode. Fairey wrote on his website that [...] "Part of being on The Simpsons, is you’re being honored as a reference point in culture." [...] He described the plot of the episode as [...] "great", adding that the staff members of the show [...] "were kind enough to indulge a couple of my dialogue suggestions designed to make the social commentary more pointed (even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to make fun of myself to do so)." [...] This was Fairey's first acting performance. Street artists English, Scharf, and Conal also guest starred in the episode as themselves.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Michael's birth, {{the family}} moved to Wetherden in Suffolk. Michael's {{education}} began in 1909, with a nursery governess and various private tutors who followed a [...] curriculum that included piano lessons—his first formal contact with music. There was a piano in the house, on which he [...] "took to improvising crazily... which I called 'composing', <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> only the vaguest notion of what that meant". In September 1914 Michael became a boarder at Brookfield Preparatory School in Swanage, Dorset. He spent four years there, at one point earning notoriety by writing an essay that challenged the existence of God. In 1918 he won a scholarship to Fettes College, a boarding school in Edinburgh, where he studied the piano, sang in the choir, and began to learn to play the pipe organ. The school was not a happy place; sadistic bullying of the younger pupils was commonplace. When Michael revealed to his parents in March 1920 that he had formed a homosexual relationship with another boy, they removed him. He transferred to Stamford School in Lincolnshire, where a decade previously Malcolm Sargent had been a pupil.|$|E
500|$|Slash's Snakepit's {{music was}} often {{described}} as hard rock and blues rock with elements of southern rock. The band were also {{often described as}} Slash's solo or side project though Slash maintained {{that they were a}} band, stating [...] "everybody wrote, everybody had equal input even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my name on it." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer J.D. Considine noted the differences between Guns N' Roses and Slash's Snakepit on their first album, stating that [...] "Guns ' Roses typically treat the melody as {{the most important part of}} the song, most of what slithers out of the Snakepit emphasizes the playing." [...] He noted that singer Eric Dover [...] "conveys the raw-throated intensity of a hard-rock frontman" [...] and [...] "he avoids the genre's most obvious excesses." [...] The riff to [...] "Good to Be Alive" [...] drew a comparison to Chuck Berry while the musicianship on the album was praised. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated that [...] "there's little argument that Slash is a great guitarist" [...] who is [...] "capable of making rock and blues clichés sound fresh". Reviewing Ain't Life Grand for Allmusic, Steve Huey described second singer Rod Jackson as [...] "a combination of '80s pop-metal bluster and Faces-era Rod Stewart" [...] with a [...] "touch of Aerosmith", a description that he felt also fitted the band as a whole. He noted, though, that Slash's guitar playing was [...] "tame" [...] and stated that the main problem of the album was the songwriting, though it was [...] "still a passable, workmanlike record that will definitely appeal to fans of grimy, old-school hard rock." [...] Malcolm Dome of Classic Rock stated that [...] "from the moment that [...] "Been There Lately" [...] opens, there's a vibe here that was missing before" [...] and that Ain't Life Grand showed [...] "purpose, direction and individuality." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{context of}} [...] "Part of Your World" [...] {{and the fact}} that it occurs before Ariel meets and falls in love with Eric is often used to defend Ariel against critics who accuse her of sacrificing her talents for a man. Boing Boings Caroline Siede {{explained}} that Ariel [...] "just happens to end up with a prince in the process of achieving her larger dream" [...] to become human. Similarly, Sophie Katz of The Odyssey Online wrote that the song proves that Ariel [...] "doesn’t give up her voice only for a guy. She already wanted to be 'part of that world.' The prince was a bonus." [...] Writing for Yahoo! Movies, Gwynne Watkins penned [...] "There’s little doubt that Ariel’s crush on Prince Eric strengthens her resolve to be part of the human world. But crucially, her love of 'the world above' is established long before she sets eyes on the prince" [...] during [...] "Part of Your World". Laura Stampler, writing for Time, agreed that the character [...] " [...] in love with the human world before she even knew who Eric was" [...] because [...] "she has always dreamed of being a 'part of your world'". Ariel sings [...] "Bright young women, sick of swimmin’, ready to stand" [...] to indicate that she fantasizes about [...] "living in a feminist-friendly society where she can speak her mind freely and grow intellectually", demonstrating envy towards women who are capable of doing this on land. However, Times Laura Stampler joked that Ariel will find the human world disappointing [...] "considering my dad definitely still reprimanded me (even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> legs)." [...] In the reprise, the lyrics [...] "Part of that world" [...] are replaced with [...] "part of your world" [...] to distinguish that the character is now referring to her feelings for Eric, whom Ariel had not yet met when she sang the original song.|$|E
