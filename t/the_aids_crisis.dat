5|$|The Blade started {{publishing}} weekly in January 1983 and coverage shifted to <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> <b>crisis</b> and news about this newly emerging disease. The ever-breaking news caused {{the paper to}} remain in a heightened state of coverage and nearly exhausted the papers resources {{with members of the}} community having to step in to support the work of the Blade. The reporting of <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> <b>crisis</b> from this timeframe allowed the newspaper to come of age to the mature and professionally driven publication seen today. In June 1988, the editors of the paper used a computer to layout the paper for the first time. The 1990s saw increases in readership and circulation of the Washington Blade. In April 1993, during the 1993 Gay March on Washington, the paper published its largest edition to date consisting of 216 pages. The paper expanded into new markets and mediums with the 1995 launch of the online version of the Blade, followed two years later with the launching of a sister publication in New York, called the New York Blade. In the later part of the century, coverage was expanded to include local and national news, as well as international news of interest to the LGBT community.|$|E

Still, much attention is being given to the needs of children made vulnerable by this pandemic and the rallying cry from academics and child development specialists alike is that institutional care fails to meet the child’s developmental needs and ways must be found to keep children in the community. (Williamson). But little attention is being paid to those who by default are caring for the children left in the wake of this disease.

In contrast, funding had been made amply available to the CDC in their efforts to stop Legionnaires' disease after an outbreak in 1976; the CDC had spent $9 million in fighting Legionnaires' disease, though the outbreak had caused fewer than 50 deaths.|$|E

Between 1985 and 1987, the number of news stories about AIDS in the American media doubled.

Eventually, he became known as a poster child for <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> <b>crisis,</b> appearing in fundraising and educational campaigns for the syndrome. Ryan participated in numerous public benefits for children with AIDS. Many celebrities appeared with Ryan, starting during his trial and continuing {{for the rest of}} his life, to help publicly destigmatize socializing with people with AIDS. Singers John Cougar Mellencamp, Elton John and Michael Jackson, actor Matt Frewer, diver Greg Louganis, President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan, Surgeon General Dr. C.

40|$|In every Western European country <b>the</b> {{occurrence}} of <b>Aids</b> {{has led to}} exceptional innovations in prevention, patient care, health policy and questions of civil rights. This exception can be explained {{not only by the}} fact that a health catastrophe was feared, but also civilizational harm in the field of civil rights. Despite national differences, this brought about similar exceptionalist alliances consisting of health professionals, social movements and those affected. With the failure of a catastrophe to arise signs of fatigue in the exceptionalist alliance and increasing possibilities of medical treatment, exceptionalism in Europe is drawing to a close. The paper elucidates specific aspects of each of the four roughly distinguishable phases in this process: Approx. 1981 - 1986 : emergence of exceptionalism. The underlying reasons for exceptionalism are investigated in this paper. Approx. 1986 - 1991 : consolidation and performance of exceptionalism. The paper investigates the exceptionalist policy model, more specifically some nationally different factors in the polity and politics that help to explain the different forms of policies. Approx. 1991 - 1996 : exceptionalism crumbling, steps toward normalization. The forces driving the process of normalization are investigated. Since 1996 : normalization, normality. The changes made in the management of HIV and Aids are elucidated using examples from the fields of health care, primary prevention and drug policies. Aids health-policy innovations, and their risks and opportunities in the course of normalization are investigated. Three possible paths of development are identified: stabilization, generalization and retreat. The chances of utilizing innovations developed in connection with <b>Aids</b> for <b>the</b> modernization of health policy in other fields of prevention and patient care vary from country to country with the degree to which Aids exceptionalism has been institutionalized and the distance of these innovations from medical/therapeutic events.

30|$|We {{note that}} microtasking works by {{dividing}} a bigger task {{into a series}} of smaller tasks that can be completed in parallel (usually by many people over the Internet). In contemporary times, a number of “microtasking” platforms have emerged as smarter ways of crowdsearching. A familiar example is the commercial microtasking platform “Amazon Mechanical Turk” run by Amazon that allows users to submit tasks for a larger job (that is too large for a single person or small team to perform) to be distributed to a crowd {{of a large number of}} volunteer global workers who are remunerated in return for performing these microtasks. Apart from commercial solutions such as the Amazon Mechanical Turk (Amazon Mechanical Turk 2016), a number of free and open-source microtasking platforms such as Crowdcrafting (Crowdcrafting 2016 c)—which was used by Digital Humanitarian Network (DHN) (Digital Humanitarian Network) volunteers in response to Typhoon Pablo in the Philippines—have been developed.

What, practically, does it mean to be a ‘borderless’ organisation in a world where migration controls are such a big political issue? What are the implications of the refugee crisis for humanitarian principles and medical care?

(HH) Das Auftreten von Aids hat in allen westeuropaeischen Laendern zu exzeptionellen Innovationen in Praevention, Krankenversorgung, Gesundheitspolitik und Buergerrechtsfragen gefuehrt. Diese Ausnahmen vom normalen Verlauf der Gesundheitspolitik erklaeren sich vor allem daraus, dass neben einer gesundheitlichen Katastrophe infolge von Aids auch Zivilisationsbrueche auf dem Gebiet der Buergerrechte befuerchtet wurden. Dies brachte eine trotz grosser nationaler Unterschiede im Grundmuster aehnliche 'exceptionalist alliance' aus beteiligten Gesundheitsberufen, sozialen Bewegungen und Betroffenen hervor, die den mangels wirksamer Therapien von der Medizin nicht besetzten Handlungsraum produktiv nutzte. Mit dem Ausbleiben der Katastrophe, Ermuedungserscheinungen der 'exceptionalist alliance' und zunehmenden Therapiemoeglichkeiten der Medizin geht der 'exceptionalism' in Europa jedoch schrittweise zu Ende. In diesem Prozess werden vier Phasen unterschieden: Entstehung des 'exceptionalism' (1981 - 1986), Praxis und Konsolidierung (1986 - 1991), Aufloesung des 'exceptionalism' und erste Anzeichen der Normalisierung (1991 - 1996), seither Normalisierung, veraenderter Umgang mit HIV und Aids.
