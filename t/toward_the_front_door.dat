2500|$|Carrying {{a bundle}} {{wrapped in a}} {{checkered}} blanket, Huberty looked toward his elder daughter, Zelia, as he walked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of the family home and said, [...] "Goodbye. I won't be back." [...] He drove down San Ysidro Boulevard. According to eyewitnesses, he drove first toward the Big Bear supermarket and then toward the U.S. Post Office, before entering {{the parking lot of}} a McDonald's restaurant located approximately 200yards from his apartment.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the singer}} {{was not always}} sweet and {{friendly}} towards women. When Christina Crawford, the adopted daughter of Joan Crawford, visited Presley, they were watching Bonanza in the TV room. [...] "Elvis had been puffing on a cigar ... as Christina tickled him and kidded around, apparently seeking more direct attention." [...] Suddenly, as Buzz Cason relates, [...] "she slung the contents of her cocktail glass right into Elvis's face. ... The cigar went 'phhhtttt' and he jumped up. ... He grabbed her by the hair. 'Get this bitch out of here!' he screamed, leading her <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> as she struggled {{to keep up with}} the rather quick pace as he was pulling her locks. Turmoil ensued as the 'boys' scrambled to assist trying to prevent too big of a scene." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tommy led the {{way through}} the hall <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> Suddenly the burglar stopped and called to him softly: [...] "Ain't there a cop out there in front somewhere {{sparking}} the girl?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Passenger {{and witness}} Aaron Li-Hill said that upon {{boarding}} the streetcar he initially noticed Yatim {{sitting at the}} back, across {{from a group of}} teenage girls. [...] He later heard giggling {{from the back of the}} streetcar followed by a scream, then saw Yatim brandishing a knife as the girls ran past him <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b> According to witness Jessica Doyle, another passenger on the streetcar, Yatim seemed irate, mentally unstable, and oblivious to her presence as he walked directly past her aboard the streetcar. Doyle reported that as he walked past her, Yatim was holding his exposed genitals in his left hand and a knife in his right hand. According to Melody Garcia, another passenger, Yatim [...] "took his penis out with one hand and a knife in another." ...|$|R
6000|$|Meantime Josie {{mounted the}} stairs, which were boarded in {{at one end}} of the building, being built on the outside to economize space, and entered the narrow upper hallway. A chatter of children's voices in the rear proclaimed that portion to be the {{quarters}} of <b>the</b> Jerrems family. <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> was a <b>door</b> on which, in dim letters, was the legend: [...] "H. Cragg. Real Estate." ...|$|R
60|$|Fuzzy {{had shot}} his arrow. They drank. The Lady smiled again {{the smile of}} her caste. James enveloped and re-conducted him <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> The harp music still softly drifted through the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{playing a}} bold game you are," [...] grumbled {{the man of}} the anvil, as the boy led the horse through the blacksmith-shop <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> [...] "I reckon you think you are mighty smart." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mercy pointed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of the building. [...] "In a shed {{outside the}} cottage," [...] she answered. [...] "It is not much; I can do {{everything}} for myself if the sentinel will let me pass through the kitchen." ...|$|E
50|$|Frykowski's {{hands had}} been bound with a towel. Freeing himself, Frykowski began {{struggling}} with Atkins, who stabbed at his legs {{with the knife}} with which she had been guarding him. As he fought his way <b>toward</b> and out <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> onto <b>the</b> porch, Watson caught up with Frykowski and struck him {{over the head with}} the gun multiple times, stabbed him repeatedly, and shot him twice. Watson broke the gun's right grip in the process.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} he reached the back of a hut {{at the head of the}} wide village street that Korak caught again, plainly, the scent of Meriem. With nose close to the {{thatched}} wall Korak sniffed eagerly about the structure--tense and palpitant as a hunting hound. <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> he made his way when once his nose had assured him that Meriem lay within; but as he rounded the side and came within view of the entrance he saw a burly Negro armed with a long spear squatting at the portal of the girl's prison. The fellow's back was toward him, his figure outlined against the glow of cooking fires further down the street. He was alone. The nearest of his fellows were beside a fire sixty or seventy feet beyond. To enter the hut Korak must either silence the sentry or pass him unnoticed. The danger in the accomplishment of the former alternative lay in the practical certainty of alarming the warriors near by and bringing them and the balance of the village down upon him. To achieve the latter appeared practically impossible. To you or me it would have been impossible; but Korak, The Killer, was not as you or I.|$|R
5000|$|No. 14 - Una, Sandy & Trimmit - [...] "Oh, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door's</b> bolted and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door's</b> barred, so we can't {{get along}} out" ...|$|R
6000|$|She stopped abruptly, {{and turned}} about <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> In {{a moment he}} was beside her. [...] "I don't think you can have heard me, Vee," [...] he said, with {{intensely}} controlled fury. [...] "I said you were"--he shouted--"NOT TO GO!" ...|$|E
60|$|The chauffeur {{came in and}} {{received}} his orders. We got into our coats and walked out <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> Suddenly I drew Jacky back and stood behind a pillar. A great touring car had turned the corner and was passing down the street. In it were three men,--the Chinese ambassador, Delora, {{and the man who}} had left the offices of Messrs. Halliday with them.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Alfred Burton came slowly out {{and locked}} the door of the room. Even then he was dimly {{conscious}} that something had happened to him. He hated the musty odor of the place, the dusty, unswept hall, and the general air of desertion. He wanted to get out into the street and he hurried his client <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> As soon as he had locked up, he breathed a little sigh of relief.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of Teylers Fundatiehuis. Until the Spaarne wing {{was built}} in 1885, access to Teylers Museum was gained through this door: <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of Pieter Teyler's residence.|$|R
25|$|George {{would wake}} up to the sound of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> slamming. He would race downstairs to find the dog {{sleeping}} soundly at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> Nobody else heard the sound although it was loud enough to wake the house.|$|R
50|$|In 1800 a portico {{was built}} for <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> In 1836 <b>the</b> shallow cellar was {{excavated}} to allow a vestibule and a room below for a Sunday School, the portico was removed and the center window above <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> was inserted.|$|R
60|$|He was {{standing}} {{right in the middle}} of the room, immediately beneath the hanging lamp. At his words--spoken with such firm confidence, as one who knows and is therefore empowered to speak--a sudden change came over the spirit of the whole assembly. Everything was forgotten in the face of this new danger--two Marats, the sleuth-hounds of the proconsul--here present, as spies and as informants! Every face became more haggard--every cheek more livid. There was a quick and furtive scurrying <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|Earlier, {{a little}} {{incident}} had occurred {{that even the}} sharp eyes of the examiner had failed to notice. When he had begun {{his work at the}} cash counter, Mr. Edlinger had winked significantly at Roy Wilson, the youthful bank messenger, and nodded his head slightly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> Roy understood, got his hat, and walked leisurely out, with his collector's book under his arm. Once outside, he made a bee-line for the Stockmen's National. That bank was also getting ready to open. No customers had, as yet, presented themselves.|$|E
60|$|A candle {{was burning}} {{on a small}} bracket, and, though its light was but dim, it showed her everything. The cabinet was open, and papers were strewn about, as though thrown right and left in a desperate search; and, {{with his back to}} her, a man was seated before it, his bared head resting upon his arms, and his whole {{attitude}} full of the passionate abandonment of a great despair. She had but one thought. It was her lover returned, and he needed her consolation. With a new light in her face she turned and moved softly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> As she reached the threshold she paused and drew back. There was the sound of footsteps inside.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, a car {{drove into}} <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> of Schaller’s. In the 1990s, a dump truck drove through <b>the</b> <b>front</b> façade of <b>the</b> building, destroying the second iteration of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The KPRK radio {{building}} in Livingston {{is on the}} National Register of Historic Places. To the right of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> a plaque says that Missoula architect William Fox designed the building, complete with the [...] "stylized radio tower" [...] above <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> in 1946.|$|R
5000|$|Phantoms {{could be}} ordered with the {{wheelchair}} lift in either <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> or rear door. Those with the lift {{in the rear}} door had a slightly wider rear door to accommodate the lift. Most Phantoms were ordered with the wheelchair lift in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R

50|$|Also, {{during the}} game, a Detective is waiting outside, slowly {{advancing}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> His arrival signifies {{the reading of}} the will and the announcement of the winner. The Detective can only move one space at a time, and only when a Detective Card (hidden inside the Trap Card pile) is drawn. There are 13 steps to the front door. If the Detective makes it to the front door before all other characters have been eliminated, the game is over.|$|E
50|$|A {{minor change}} in the paint scheme in 2003 was applied only to Highway Patrol vehicles; the blue line {{continued}} over the yellow line from rear to front, without intersecting, but with a curve <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> Search lights were mounted {{on each side of}} the light bar on the roof, and also on the front sides. The PRPD logo was placed on the left side of the front door, rather than being centered on the door, while the highway patrol logo was centered on the rear doors.|$|E

50|$|There {{follows a}} chase aboard Wallace and Gromit's model train set, as Gromit tries to stop Feathers from {{escaping}} with the stolen diamond. Feathers attempts to escape by {{driving the train}} straight <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> but Gromit quickly switches the tracks before he can escape. Wallace's attempts to assist are mostly unsuccessful, though he manages to remove Feathers' gun and free himself from the trousers. Feathers' train collides with the trousers, and he is captured in a bottle, taken to the police station, and imprisoned in a zoo.|$|E

50|$|In {{the third}} story, Scott (Glenn Quinn) is riding his {{motorcycle}} through the country. He notices a rural farmhouse and seeks shelter there during a rainstorm. Inside {{is a beautiful}} mute woman named Heather (Jacinda Barrett); she communicates with Scott by writing on a handheld chalkboard, and invites him to stay the night. During the night, they are disturbed when her father, a rancher, arrives. Scott hears a commotion downstairs, and runs to the kitchen, where he sees two bloodied bodies, and witnesses Heather's father throwing a woman's severed head into the well outside. He finds Heather unharmed, and she insists they leave the house. On the chalkboard, she writes that there are ghosts there. Suddenly, they are confronted by her father, who attacks Scott with an axe. They flee from the house, and as they leave, he passes by Heather's father, who walks <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and enters the house, {{as if in a}} time loop. Scott and Heather ride away on his motorcycle, and spend the night under a willow tree. In the morning, he removes the locket from her neck and opens it; inside are a photo of him and her, dressed in oldfashioned clothing. As Heather awakens, a slash wound appears across her neck, and her head falls into his lap.|$|E

50|$|The cottage {{is raised}} on short {{concrete}} stumps. Three concrete steps lead to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> Ornamental cast iron work {{is attached to}} the base of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wall. Three panel casement windows are present either side of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and there are three four panel sash windows {{on each side of the}} cottage.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, {{there was}} a smaller door {{in the back of}} the lavvu, {{opposite}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> called <b>the</b> bear door. This was used for ceremonial purposes, such as removing the dead (not appropriate out of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door)</b> and similar functions. [...] Few lavvus today have this door for such purposes.|$|R
