5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
5|$|If I were in {{possession}} of any public documents calculated to advance the public interest, it would give me pleasure to furnish <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall at all times be prepared to afford you any information which the constitution or laws of the State may require.... If the difficulty, real or supposed, has grown out of the circumstances of my having been connected with the negotiation at St Mary's, I feel it my duty to state to the committee that I acted from an entire conviction of its propriety and an anxious desire, on my part, to promote the welfare and accomplish {{the wishes of the}} whole people of the State in assisting to add a large and fertile tract of country to that which we already possess.|$|E

25|$|Would {{you ask me}} how I dare {{to compare}} the civil rights {{struggle}} with the struggle for lesbian and gay rights? I can compare <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do compare them, because I {{know what it means to}} be called a 'nigger' and I know what it means to be called a 'faggot,' and I understand the differences in the marrow of my bones. And I can sum up that difference in one word: none.|$|E
25|$|I had to gain {{them some}} time, and I {{could think of}} nothing other than to attack. I had to stop them somehow. I distracted <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't going to make it back.|$|E
500|$|In 1810 Bishop Asbury visited {{an obscure}} {{part of the}} western country (Kanawha) which was then a wilderness, and pleasantly told the Rev. Thomas S. Hinde that he had visited the region in order that the people might see and know their superintendent; remarking, [...] "The {{shepherd}} ought to know the flock, and the flock the shepherd: they ought to know what man it is that governs <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have come nearly one hundred miles {{out of my way}} to see them." [...] The writer exclaims, [...] "O Asbury, the inhabitants of these hills and mountains will long make mention of thee!" ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1964U.S. presidential election, Senator Barry Goldwater {{quickly became}} the likely Republican Party nominee. Goldwater {{represented}} {{a new wave of}} American conservatism, of which the moderate Romney was not a part. Romney also felt that Goldwater would be a drag on Republicans running in all the other races that year, including Romney's own (at the time, Michigan had two-year terms for its governor). Finally, Romney disagreed strongly with Goldwater's views on civil rights; he would later say, [...] "Whites and Negroes, in my opinion, have got to learn to know each other. Barry Goldwater didn't have any background to understand this, to fathom <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't get through to him." ...|$|E
500|$|Romney {{supported}} the American Civil Rights Movement while governor. [...] Although {{he belonged to}} a church that did not allow black people in its lay clergy, Romney's hardscrabble background and subsequent life experiences led him to support the movement. He reflected, [...] "It was only after I got to Detroit that I got to know Negroes and began {{to be able to}} evaluate <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> began to recognize that some Negroes are better and more capable than lots of whites." [...] During his first State of the State address in January 1963, Romney declared that [...] "Michigan's most urgent human rights problem is racial discrimination—in housing, public accommodations, education, administration of justice, and employment." [...] Romney helped create the state's first civil rights commission.|$|E
500|$|In September 1794, Wellesley {{experienced}} {{his first}} battle, against the French, at the Battle of Boxtel with the 33rd. His promotion to colonel, on 3 May 1796, came by seniority, and in June {{he was sent}} with the 33rd to India. In 1799 he fought in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, commanding three victorious actions with the British East India Company. After winning the war, and serving as governor of Seringapatam and Mysore, Wellesley was promoted to major-general on 29 April 1802, {{although he did not}} receive the news until September. Whilst in India he wrote of his regiment [...] "I have commanded them for nearly ten years during which I have scarcely been away from <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have always found them to be the quietest and best behaved body of men in the army." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never would}} ’ave one," [...] said the boatswain, rising, and placing {{the letter in}} his breast-pocket. [...] "I’ve got along all right for thirty years without <b>’em,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> ain’t going to begin now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has come}} out {{uncommon}} strong," [...] said Mr. Foker; [...] "I have seen his verses; Rouncy copied <b>'em.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> said to myself when I saw 'em, 'Catch me writin' verses to a woman,--that's all.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The boy is put upon," [...] Mrs. Burns always argued. [...] "A quieter, more peaceabler boy I never knew, {{except my}} own Jack. They're good, helpful boys, both of <b>'em,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't care what anybody says." ...|$|R
500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret {{for some of}} her comments and actions, stating:I {{would like to say}} something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt <b>them.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E
500|$|Parker {{said he and}} Stone did {{not intend}} for [...] "Damien" [...] to be {{offensive}} to Christians or any other religion: [...] "In South Park, Jesus is a great guy, he's on our show, and in this episode he's the hero. We're {{not in the business}} of offending people. We're in the business of making people laugh." [...] The mean way Damien is treated by his fellow students when he joins the school, as well as Damien's reactions to the treatment, were inspired by Parker's experience of the second grade, when he started at a Cheyenne, Wyoming elementary school in the last three weeks of the school year. Parker said, [...] "It was brutal ... Everybody already had their little groups and the year was almost over, so I wasn't going to fit into any of <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just wanted to destroy and kill, which was the inspiration for this show." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{remains of}} the crew members of HH-53C Jolly Roger 67—Chapman, Call, Avery, Prater, and Pearson, and Alley—were {{returned}} to the United States on October 1, 1997. The six were honored on November 19, 1997 in a full military funeral at Arlington National Cemetery and a headstone commemorating all six airmen was placed at the site. Hambleton was unable to attend due to poor health, but a letter from him was read. He wrote, [...] "They deserve all the accolades that we, the living, can bestow upon them. Again, I thank them, I honor <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will always hold great faith in my heart with them." [...] Clark was present. He told {{the families of the}} downed fliers that [...] "Each of you played a distinct role and forming the character of these men who so willingly paid a very dear price to help me get out of the jungles of Vietnam. You have my deepest sympathy—you and these six brave men." ...|$|E
6000|$|A woman cannot ever {{be sure of}} {{not being}} married till she is buried, Mrs. Doctor, dear, <b>and</b> {{meanwhile}} <b>I</b> will make a batch of cherry pies. I notice the doctor favors <b>'em,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> DO like cooking {{for a man who}} appreciates his victuals." ...|$|R

500|$|In April 2015, it was {{revealed}} that a settlement had been reached with The Gap Band's publishing company, Minder Music, to add The Gap Band and producer Lonnie Simmons as co-writers, who will receive 17% of the royalties from Mark and Mars' hit [...] "Uptown Funk". The claim on behalf of The Gap Band and Lonnie Simmons was entered into YouTube’s content management system preventing payments to the publisher. Later, on August 12, Serbian pop artist Viktorija has also argued that [...] "Uptown Funk" [...] infringed on her track [...] "Ulice mračne nisu za devojke". She stated that she had no hurry to sue them, since [...] "these processes take a long time, and my life and career does not depend on lawsuits." [...] She added, [...] "for these lawsuits, there should be a lot of money, the lawyers are working on a percentage. If I still decide to sue <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> win, I {{have to figure out what}} to do with that money." ...|$|E
500|$|Badmotorfinger {{has been}} {{classified}} by various critics as grunge, alternative metal, heavy metal and hard rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic {{said that the}} songwriting on the album [...] "takes a quantum leap in focus and consistency". He added, [...] "It's surprisingly cerebral and arty music for a band courting mainstream metal audiences, but it attacks with scientific precision." [...] Guitarist Kim Thayil jokingly called it the [...] "Heavy Metal White Album". Cornell said, [...] "I think there's songs on the new record which are almost more commercially viable because they have that memorable feel to <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think if anyone expected us {{to come out and}} make something more commercial than Louder Than Love, then I'm glad that they were surprised." [...] Cornell also added that the album was more representative of how the band was live. Shepherd contributed the song [...] "Somewhere" [...] and collaborated on the musical composition of several other songs on the album. Thayil said that Shepherd's contributions helped make the album [...] "faster" [...] and [...] "weirder".|$|E
500|$|Francis also {{expressed}} her disappointment in her former daytime role on General Hospital. She {{said that she}} has found that her [...] "fan base will follow" [...] her whatever she does. She explained that, [...] "My job is not to disappoint , not to cheat <b>them.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> feel like the last little appearance on GH cheated them. I welcome {{the opportunity to do}} something new to continue to entertain my audience. What I loved about Laura—and what people loved about Laura—is that she is a terrific memory, but it’s just not there anymore." [...] Soap Opera Digest later confirmed the character's name to be Genevieve Atkinson. Co-head writer of The Young and the Restless, Scott Hamner, stated that the role {{was going to be a}} [...] "very, very different character than we've seen Genie Francis portray". Bell opened up about hiring Francis, revealing: [...] "Genie is amazing and a real pro. I put pen and paper and she ran with it. She is really a brave, courageous actress" [...] and added that [...] "It really has been fantastic to watch, and I think she is terrific." ...|$|E

500|$|Milian's {{first major}} acting role was {{offered by the}} Disney Channel to join The Mickey Mouse Club; however, she did not accept and opted to star as a {{reporter}} on Movie Surfers. During this time, she had minor roles in film and television, including Sister, Sister, Smart Guy, The Steve Harvey Show, Get Real, The Wood and American Pie. In 2002, Milian was appointed {{the host of the}} live competitive music series Becoming Presents: Wannabe on MTV, where she met director Joseph Kahn. Kahn suggested she audition for a lead role in the film Torque. Her audition was successful and she played a minor role in the film. She was subsequently cast in her first lead role in Love Don't Cost a Thing. Milian {{has been described as a}} role model to young girls; she has said that there are a lot of people who young girls look up to, but [...] "at the end of the day you have to be your own person and love yourself." [...] Milian worked with the Children Uniting Nations charity, in which she was a big sister to foster children, and says her favorite charity is the Penny Lane Foundation. Milian was awarded with a humanitarian award at The Reign fundraiser from the Elton John AIDS Foundation for being a role model for young children. Milian said, [...] "I've never been rewarded that way and never been acknowledged like that. That was really nice of <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was happy I was able to show up for the kids." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the Palm Beach media {{attention}} and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy's public image suffered. A Gallup Poll gave Kennedy {{a very low}} 22percent national approval rating. A Boston Herald/WCVB-TV poll found that 62 percent of Massachusetts citizens thought Kennedy should not run for re-election, by a 2-to-1 margin thought Kennedy had misled authorities in the Palm Beach investigation, and had Kennedy losing a hypothetical Senate race to Governor William Weld by 25points. Meanwhile, at a June 17, 1991, dinner party, Kennedy saw Victoria Anne Reggie, a Washington lawyer at Keck, Mahin & Cate, a divorced mother of two, and {{the daughter of an}} old Kennedy family ally, Louisiana judge Edmund Reggie. They began dating and by September were in a serious relationship. In a late October speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Kennedy sought to begin a political recovery, saying: [...] "I am painfully aware that the criticism directed at me in recent months involves far more than disagreements with my positions ... involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight the good fight. To them I say, I recognize my own shortcomings– the faults in the conduct of my private life. I realize that I alone am responsible for <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am the one who must confront them." [...] In December 1991, the William Kennedy Smith rape trial was held; it was nationally televised and the most watched until the O. J. Simpson murder case three years later. Kennedy's testimony at the trial seemed relaxed, confident, and forthcoming, and helped convince the public that his involvement had been peripheral and unintended. Smith was acquitted.|$|E
2500|$|Montreal Mayor Gérald Tremblay stated [...] "This is so tragic. How do {{we talk to}} {{the parents}} who are going through this? All I {{can say is that}} I feel for <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> care for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I swore I wouldn't touch a farthing's {{worth of}} her jewellery, which perhaps I {{did not think}} was worth a great deal,--but what can a woman do more than give you her all?
