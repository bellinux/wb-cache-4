5|$|Canadian {{citizenship}} is typically obtained by birth in Canada or by birth or adoption abroad when {{at least one}} biological parent or adoptive parent is a Canadian citizen {{who was born in}} Canada or naturalized in Canada (and did not receive citizenship by being born outside of Canada to a Canadian citizen). It can also be granted to a permanent resident who lives in Canada for three out of four years and meets specific requirements. Canada established its own nationality law in 1946, with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act which took effect on January 1, 1947. <b>The</b> <b>Immigration</b> and Refugee Protection Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada in 2001 as Bill C-11, which replaced <b>the</b> <b>Immigration</b> Act of 1976 as the primary federal legislation regulating immigration. Prior to the conferring of legal status on Canadian citizenship, Canada's naturalization laws consisted of a multitude of Acts beginning with <b>the</b> <b>Immigration</b> Act of 1910.|$|E
5|$|Restrictions on {{immigration}} and naturalization of Chinese were eventually lifted {{as a consequence of}} the Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943 (also known as the Magnuson Act) and <b>the</b> <b>Immigration</b> and Nationality Act of 1965.|$|E

5|$|The {{private sector}} {{was not the}} only source of racism: under President Wilson, the plight of African Americans in {{government}} jobs suffered. Many federal agencies adopted whites-only employment practices, the Army excluded blacks from officer ranks, and <b>the</b> <b>immigration</b> service prohibited <b>the</b> <b>immigration</b> of persons of African ancestry. Du Bois wrote an editorial in 1914 deploring the dismissal of blacks from federal posts, and he supported William Monroe Trotter when Trotter brusquely confronted Wilson about Wilson's failure to fulfill his campaign promise of justice for blacks.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the end of}} the 19th century, the {{increase}} in coal mining and steel works around Wales led to <b>the</b> <b>immigration</b> of Italian workers. The workers brought families who integrated their culture into Welsh society, bringing with them Italian ice cream and Italian cafes, now a staple of Welsh society.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1850s, <b>the</b> <b>immigration</b> of Chinese into the Colony of Vancouver Island and Colony of British Columbia peaked {{with the onset of}} the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 August <b>the</b> <b>Immigration</b> Department issued 2,180 passes to workers and agents to collect visas and submit {{applications}} to work in Hong Kong, promising to handle all applications submitted. Offices opened one hour earlier than usual, added staff and extended their hours to guarantee that all 2,180 cases would be processed. The Philippine consulate also expected a large workload {{as a result of}} the rehiring provisions. Chinese newspapers published articles calculating how households could maximise their benefits under the waiver rules. Street protests on 3 August decried the waiver's unfairness and its burden on <b>the</b> <b>Immigration</b> Department.

5|$|Singaporean {{courts have}} {{accepted}} the existence of both procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. In Re Siah Mooi Guat (1988), the applicant was a Malaysian national who was declared a prohibited immigrant under section 8(3)(k) of <b>the</b> <b>Immigration</b> Act and had her re-entry permit to Singapore and employment pass cancelled. As the applicant's appeal to the Minister for Home Affairs was rejected, the applicant took out an application to the High Court to quash {{the decision of the}} Minister. One ground of the application was that the applicant had a legitimate expectation to two procedural rights: the opportunity to make representations to the Minister before he considered her case under <b>the</b> <b>Immigration</b> Act, and the duty of the Minister to give reasons for his decision.|$|E
5|$|According to estimates, around 77,980 Armenians {{lived in}} the US by 1919. An {{unprecedented}} number of Armenians entered the country in 1920, but <b>the</b> <b>Immigration</b> Act of 1924 that restricted immigration from southern and eastern Europe barred many other Armenians from emigrating to the US. Most of the post-World War I immigrants were women and children, {{in contrast to the}} prewar immigration, which was predominantly young and male. Like Italians, for whom this practice was known as campanilismo, Armenian communities were often formed by people from the same village or town in the Ottoman Empire. This practice almost entirely disappeared after World War II.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} in the United States, McCarthyism was at its height, {{generating}} fear and suspicion of entertainment industry figures, academics, military figures, and government officials by accusing them of real or suggested links to communist activities. The TSO was required to submit to United States immigration authorities all the names of its musicians and other staff who would be accompanying the tour. <b>The</b> <b>immigration</b> department approved visas for all but seven musicians, suspecting them of communist activities. One of the musicians was later cleared, leaving six musicians who were denied entry.|$|E

5|$|But several {{defining}} {{features of}} modern Canada {{can be traced}} back to Diefenbaker. Diefenbaker's Bill of Rights remains in effect, and signalled the change in Canadian political culture that would eventually bring about the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which came into force after his death. Diefenbaker was the first to appoint women and ethnic minorities to Cabinet. It was under Diefenbaker that Canada finally achieved universal adult suffrage, with the granting of the vote to Native Canadians in 1960. The removal of explicit racial discrimination from the criteria for admission to Canada under <b>the</b> <b>Immigration</b> Act of 1961 was a factor in the creation of today's multi-cultural and multi-ethnic Canada.|$|E
5|$|Charles Brooke {{encouraged}} <b>the</b> <b>immigration</b> of the Chinese coolies, {{beginning in}} the 1860s, to expand the state's gambier and pepper industry. Chinese settlers in neighbouring Sabah and Pontianak also established gambier and pepper plantations, although they existed as independent fiefdoms. These plantations rose {{to become one of}} the state's major industries as worldwide prices for gambier went up during the 1880s and 1890s. In the 20th century, as worldwide gambier prices took a dive, the Kangchu channelled their efforts into pepper and opium cultivation in the state. Sarawak's Kangchu system fell into obscurity in the 1920s, as the opium trade with Hong Kong steadily declined during the course of the decade.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the true}} {{second wave of}} {{immigration}} did not begin until <b>the</b> <b>Immigration</b> and Nationality Act of 1965 abolished national origins quotas. After the passage of that act, Armenians from the Soviet Union, Turkey, Lebanon, Iran and other Middle Eastern countries began migrating in large numbers, many fleeing political instability in their host countries. In the 1950s, most Armenian immigrants in the US were from Soviet Armenia and Turkey. The Istanbul pogrom in 1955 frightened the local Turkish Armenian population, which looked to the West for a safe and more prosperous life.|$|E
30|$|The {{admission}} of immigrants {{continues to be}} regulated by the 1960 s legislation (Boyd, 2014). <b>The</b> 1965 <b>Immigration</b> Act remains <b>the</b> basis of <b>the</b> U.S. <b>immigration</b> policy and emphasizes family-sponsored immigration, not employment-based immigration (Boyd, 2014; Yang, 2000). Family-sponsored immigration does not require any specific skill or ability and family-sponsored immigrants are often not professionals. Immigrant professionals tend to be employment-based immigrants, so by emphasizing family-sponsored <b>immigration</b> and reunification, <b>the</b> current <b>immigration</b> policy decreases <b>the</b> share of immigrant professionals.|$|R

5|$|In 1960, {{following}} {{the breakdown of}} his marriage, Afroyim {{decided to return to}} the United States, but the State Department refused to renew his U.S. passport, ruling that because Afroyim had voted in the 1951 Israeli legislative election, he had lost his citizenship under the provisions of the Nationality Act of 1940. A letter certifying Afroyim's loss of citizenship was issued by <b>the</b> <b>Immigration</b> and Naturalization Service (INS) on January 13, 1961.|$|E
5|$|In the United States during July 2007, Aman Kapoor, {{founder of}} <b>the</b> <b>Immigration</b> Voice forum, {{initiated}} a Gandhigiri protest inspired by Lage Raho Munna Bhai.

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, choral {{associations}} became common in Maryland, and Baltimore, buoyed by <b>the</b> <b>immigration</b> of numerous Germans. These groups were formed {{for the purpose}} of instruction in choral music, eventually performing oratorios. The popularity of these choral associations helped to garner support among the local population for putting music education in the city's public schools. The Baltimore Oratorio Society, the Liederkranz and the Germania Männerchor were {{the most important of these}} associations, and their traditions were maintained into the 20th century by organizations like the Bach Choir, Choral Arts Society, Concert Artists of Baltimore, Handel Society and the Baltimore Symphony Chorus.|$|E
