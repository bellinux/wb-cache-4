40|$|A {{wide variety}} of x-ray {{detectors}} is available, some counting single photons, some providing only measurements of count rate or <b>total</b> flux, <b>others</b> <b>measuring</b> the energy, position, and/or incidence time of each x-ray. Table 4 - 2 provides typical values for useful energy range, energy resolution, dead time per event, and maximum count rate capability for common x-ray detectors.

40|$|In recent years, infections of {{implanted}} plastic devices by coagulase-negative staphylococci {{have become}} {{a major cause of}} septicaemia in human patients. The causal bacterial species is usually Staphylococcus epidermidis and these organisms grow as a biofilm adherent to a solid surface. Several methods have been introduced to assess the mass of adherent bacteria and the slimy ma-trix in which they are embedded. Some methods <b>measure</b> <b>total</b> biofilm, <b>others</b> <b>measure</b> the organ-isms or the slime alone. In vitro, the type of medium, the atmosphere during incubation, {{and the nature of the}} solid surface, affect the quantity of biofilm that is formed. In most studies on the chemistry of the slime, the material used was formed on complex media solidified with agar. Contamination by ingredients of the media or b...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} facultative skin pigmentation, which predicts circulating levels of plasma 25 -hydroxymitamin D, and several measures of bone mass and structure in a cross sectional sample of adolescent females living in Hawaii. Methods: Our sample was composed of adolescent females (n = 94) living in Hawaii where seasonal sun exposure is minimal, and who self-identified as either white (n = 16) or Asian (n = 78). Bone mineral content (BMC) of the total body, the lumbar spine and the hip, and cross sectional area (CSA) and section modulus (Z) at the proximal femur were quantified using DXA. Facultative skin pigmentation was measured at the forehead and non-facultative skin pigmentation was measured at the inner arm using a Chroma Meter CR- 200 b colorimeter. Results: There {{were no significant differences}} between ethnic groups in terms of skin pigmentation. The difference between a* taken at the forehead and inner upper arm significantly predicted BMC at the lumbar spine, total hip, and <b>total</b> body. <b>Other</b> <b>measures</b> of skin pigmentation were not significant predictors of any <b>other</b> <b>measure</b> of skeletal integrity. Conclusions: The difference between facultative and non-facultative skin pigmentation for a* is a significant predictor BMC, but not bone structure. Our findings are limited by an inability to control for long term UVA and UVB exposure and lack of a measure of serum 25 (OH) D status. Further research is needed to examine these questions, particularly in populations who live at high latitudes where a winter season limits vitamin D 3 synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Sleep problems, {{which can}} have {{significant}} clinical and economic consequences, {{are more common}} among alcoholics than among nonalcoholics. During both drinking periods and withdrawal, alcoholics commonly experience problems falling asleep and decreased <b>total</b> sleep time. <b>Other</b> <b>measures</b> of sleep are also disturbed. Even alcoholics who have been abstinent for {{short periods of time}} (i. e., several weeks) or extended periods of time (i. e., several years) may experience persistent sleep abnormalities. Researchers also found that alcoholics are more likely to suffer from certain sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea. Conversely, sleep problems may predispose some people to developing alcohol problems. Furthermore, sleep problems may increase the risk of relapse among abstinent alcoholics.

40|$|Background: Ischaemic {{heart disease}} (IHD) is {{currently}} ranked eighth among the {{leading causes of}} deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA). Yet, effective population-wide preventive measures targeting risks {{in the region are}} still largely unavailable. We aimed to review population-wide and individual-level interventions addressing risk factors of IHD among adults in sSA. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health and AJOL was conducted to identify studies focusing on population-wide and individuallevel interventions targeting risks of IHD among adults in sSA. We conducted a detailed synthesis of basic findings of selected studies. Results: A total of 2311 studies were identified, with only 9 studies meeting our selection criteria. 3 broad interventions were identified: dietary modifications, physical activity and community-based health promotion measures on tobacco and alcohol cessation. 3 studies reported significant reduction in blood pressure (BP), and another study reported statistically significant reduction in mean <b>total</b> cholesterol. <b>Other</b> outcome <b>measures</b> observed ranged from mild to no reduction in BP, blood glucose, body mass index and total cholesterol, respectively. Conclusions: We cannot specify with all certainty contextually feasible interventions that can be effective in modifying IHD risk factors in population groups across sSA. We recommend more research on IHD, particularly on the understanding of the burden, geared towards developing and/or strengthening preventive and treatment interventions for the disease in sS...|$|R
