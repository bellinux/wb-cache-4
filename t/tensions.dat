30|$|The <b>tensioning</b> stress {{distribution}} of {{circular saw blade}} after roll <b>tensioning</b> was described by Szymani [2]. In the inner loop of the <b>tensioned</b> region, the tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress is compressive, and its value increases gradually from loop of the <b>tensioned</b> region to inside. In the exterior loop of the <b>tensioned</b> region, the tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress is tensile, and its value decreases gradually from loop of the <b>tensioned</b> region to outside. This distribution of tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress is not very ideal relatively. The tangential <b>tensioning</b> stresses of circular saw blades <b>tensioned</b> by three levels of hammering were measured by X-ray stress meter [3, 4]. The tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress outside hammer region increases with radius, which is an ideal distribution. This phenomenon indicates that the distribution of tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress produced by hammering is more reasonable than that produced by roll <b>tensioning.</b> However, hammer <b>tensioning</b> has its limitations because the hammer <b>tensioning</b> creates a very irregular surface and produce localized, non-axisymmetric stresses because the force and position of spots are controlled by workers and its reproducibility and controllability {{are very difficult to}} be mastered, and it depends heavily on the experience and skills of saw repairing workers. The precision of hammer <b>tensioning</b> is relatively poor. Multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process is one kind of <b>tensioning</b> methods and a quasi-static process. The fixed areas of circular saw blade are pressed by spherical or cylindrical surface during multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process. The force and position of spots are controlled precisely by automated machinery during the multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process. A cyclic symmetry {{stress distribution}} and appropriate macroscopic deformation can be obtained by the multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process. Therefore, a more ideal distribution of tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress is produced during multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process. This <b>tensioning</b> approach is conducive to the realization of the automatic <b>tensioning</b> operation, especially in the production of ultra-thin circular saw blades.|$|R

Focusing {{on the problem of}} <b>tension</b> fluctuation caused by the attitude of carbon fiber placement head, gravity balance characteristic of symmetrical objects is adopted to propose a <b>tension</b> control method for eliminating the <b>tension</b> fluctuation and <b>tension</b> measuring error caused by gravity. In this way, the <b>tension</b> is kept constant depending on <b>tension</b> feedback control.

Only a few studies are about the generation process of <b>tensioning</b> stress during <b>tensioning</b> process. The theoretical model of roll <b>tensioning</b> process was established by Szymani. The <b>tensioning</b> stresses obtained by the model were generally in good agreement with the experimentally determined <b>tensioning</b> stresses [1]. The model of roll <b>tensioning</b> process was established by Nicoletti based on finite element method and the <b>tensioning</b> stresses were obtained, the introduction of these stresses into a modal analysis allowed us to predict the dynamic behavior of circular saw blade [16]. A finite element model for roll <b>tensioning</b> of circular saw blades which allowed the investigation of various roll <b>tensioning</b> parameters was developed by Heisel [17]. There is little theoretical research about the generation process of <b>tensioning</b> stress during multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process at present. For an in-depth research of generation process of <b>tensioning</b> stress during multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process, a numerical model which could both meet the requirement of computational efficiency and accuracy should be established first.|$|R

40|$|<b>Tension</b> and {{suspense}} {{are powerful}} emotional experiences {{that occur in}} a wide variety of contexts (e. g., in music, film, literature, and everyday life).
