40|$|The {{transfer}} {{functions of}} <b>tips</b> with various sharpened <b>tip</b> ends were calculated and {{the resolution of}} these <b>tips</b> was estimated by considering the resolution limit due to thermal noise at room temperature. The <b>tip</b> having an ellipsoidal <b>tip</b> end (ellipsoidal <b>tip)</b> {{is found to be}} a suitable candidate for high-resolution magnetic force microscopy. Sharpening of the flat <b>tip</b> end makes zero signal frequencies disappear for <b>tips</b> with ellipticities larger than tan 45 /spl deg/. The sensitivity shows a maximum around an ellipticity of tan 80 /spl deg/. The ellipsoidal <b>tip</b> shows a much smaller <b>tip</b> thickness dependence compared to the <b>tip</b> having a flat <b>tip</b> end because only the <b>tip</b> end mainly contributes to signals in case of the ellipsoidal <b>tip...</b>|$|R

The ogee and swept <b>tip</b> blades required less torque coefficient at lower rotational speeds and roughly equivalent torque coefficient at higher rotational speeds compared with the baseline square <b>tip</b> blades in forward flight.

5|$|As Waters' debut novel, <b>Tipping</b> the Velvet {{was highly}} {{acclaimed}} and {{was chosen by}} The New York Times and The Library Journal {{as one of the}} best books of 1998. Waters followed it with two other novels set in the Victorian era, both of which were also well received. Reviewers have offered the most praise for <b>Tipping</b> the Velvets use of humour, adventure, and sexual explicitness. The novel was adapted into a somewhat controversial three-part series of the same name produced and broadcast by the BBC in 2002 and a stage play in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Quarrying in Giffnock {{continued}} until 1912 when, due to flooding {{and the high}} cost of extracting stone, work ceased. Numerous ventures tried to revitalise the quarries for other purposes, including the cultivation of mushrooms in the tunnels. As the pits began to fill with water, it became an issue that needed to be resolved. In the early 1930s, William Bearmore & Co began <b>tipping</b> slag from the production of steel into the Giffnock quarries. The slag <b>tipping</b> {{continued until}} 1969, when Derek Crouch Limited began scrap metal extraction, which lasted until the late 1970s. Today the ground is a wasteland.|$|E

50|$|All cue <b>tips</b> {{once were}} of a {{one-piece}} construction, as are many today (including LePro and Triangle). More recently some <b>tips</b> are made of layers that are laminated together (major brands include kamui, Moori and Talisman). Harder <b>tips</b> and laminated <b>tips</b> hold their shape better than softer <b>tips</b> and one-piece <b>tips.</b> Laminated <b>tips</b> generally cost more than one-piece <b>tips</b> due to their more extensive manufacturing process. A potential problem with layered <b>tips</b> is delamination, where a layer begins to separate from another or the <b>tip</b> completely comes apart. This is not common and usually results from improper installation, misuse of <b>tip</b> tools, or high impact massé shots. One-piece <b>tips</b> {{are not subject to}} this problem, but they do tend to mushroom more easily.|$|R

40|$|The two {{closely related}} {{eukaryotic}} AAA+ proteins, <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49, are essential components of large multi-protein complexes {{that are involved}} in diverse cellular processes. Specific mechanisms for their activity in transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodelling, DNA repair and apoptosis have not yet been characterised; however, different oligomeric forms, sub-cellular localisation and post translational modification of <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 may be important in co-ordinating these functions. The assembly of the human <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 into different oligomers was studied. Both proteins were mainly monomeric in the absence of nucleotide cofactors. Incubation with ATP or ADP in the presence of Mg 2 + modified the distribution of <b>TIP</b> 48 oligomers to favour hexamers, but this did not occur with <b>TIP</b> 49. The double hexameric complex of <b>TIP</b> 48 /TIP 49 was also analysed and indicated a heterodisperse population of species, which provided clues about assembly pathways. <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 are structurally homologous to the bacterial branch migration motor RuvB. <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 do not incorporate the DNA binding domain present in RuvB, and instead have acquired a novel domain (Domain II) inserted between the Walker A and B ATPase motifs. Using mutants, we demonstrated that <b>TIP</b> 48 Domain II is critical for regulating nucleotide dependent hexamerisation of <b>TIP</b> 48. Furthermore, <b>TIP</b> 48 /TIP 49 complexes lacking Domain II indicated that hexamer-hexamer interactions are not exclusively mediated by Domain II; this domain may regulate the assembly of different forms of the heteromeric complex. Interactions between <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 and several putative binding partners were tested in vitro. The ATPase activity and oligomerisation of <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 were assayed in the presence of Hint 1, which was reported to disrupt the homotypic and heterotypic interactions within the <b>TIP</b> 48 /TIP 49 complex. Finally, the sub-cellular localisation and post translational modification of <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 were analysed. Using immunofluorescence and GFP-tagged <b>TIP</b> 49, we confirmed that <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 associate with the mitotic spindle; however, <b>TIP</b> 48 accumulates at the midbody during cytokinesis, while <b>TIP</b> 49 does not. Furthermore, we investigated potential modifications of <b>TIP</b> 48 and <b>TIP</b> 49 by 2 -D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which may account for the regulation of these distinct functions. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{controlled}} {{wind tunnel}} test program was conducted on a model 2. 14 m (7 ft) diameter teetering rotor to determine the effectiveness of blade <b>tips</b> such as the Ogee <b>tip</b> and the TAMI (<b>Tip</b> Air Mass Injection) <b>tip</b> in reducing the impulsive noise due to blade-vortex interaction in descent flight. In addition, a full rectangular <b>tip</b> which has the same span as the Ogee <b>tip</b> and an effective rectangular <b>tip</b> which has the same lifting area as the Ogee <b>tip</b> were also considered. The tests were conducted at two advance ratios (0. 125 and 0. 14) with various descent rates ranging from steady level flight to about 6 m/sec (20 ft/sec). A comparison {{of the performance of}} different rotors showed that for the same <b>tip</b> Mach number and thrust, the Ogee <b>tip</b> rotor absorbed more power than the full rectangular <b>tip</b> rotor, while the TAMI <b>tip</b> rotor absorbed more power than the effective <b>tip</b> rotor...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tat-interactive protein 60 (<b>Tip</b> 60) is {{a member}} of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases. Studies using cultured cells have shown that <b>Tip</b> 60 has various {{functions}} including DNA repair, apoptosis and cell-cycle regulation. We globally ablated the <b>Tip</b> 60 gene (Htatip), observing that <b>Tip</b> 60 -null embryos die at the blastocyst stage (Hu et al. Dev. Dyn. 238 : 2912; 2009). Although adult heterozygous (<b>Tip</b> 60 (+/-)) mice reproduce normally without a haploinsufficient phenotype, stress caused by Myc over-expression induced B-cell lymphoma in <b>Tip</b> 60 (+/-) adults, suggesting that <b>Tip</b> 60 is a tumor suppressor (Gorrini et al. Nature 448 : 1063; 2007). These findings prompted assessment of whether <b>Tip</b> 60, alternative splicing of which generates two predominant isoforms termed <b>Tip</b> 60 α and <b>Tip</b> 60 β, functions to suppress the cell-cycle in adult cardiomyocytes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Western blotting revealed that <b>Tip</b> 60 α is the predominant <b>Tip</b> 60 isoprotein in the embryonic heart, transitioning at neonatal stages to <b>Tip</b> 60 β, which is the only isoprotein in the adult heart wherein it is highly enriched. Over-expression of <b>Tip</b> 60 β, but not <b>Tip</b> 60 α, inhibited cell proliferation in NIH 3 T 3 cells; and, <b>Tip</b> 60 -haploinsufficient cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes exhibited increased cell-cycle activity. To address whether <b>Tip</b> 60 β suppresses the cardiomyocyte cell-cycle in the adult heart, hypertrophic stress was induced in <b>Tip</b> 60 (+/+) and Tip(+/-) littermates via two methods, Myc over-expression and aortic banding. Based on immunostaining cell-cycle markers and western blotting cyclin D, stress increased cardiomyocyte cell-cycle mobilization in <b>Tip</b> 60 (+/-) hearts, in comparison with <b>Tip</b> 60 (+/+) littermates. Aortic-banded <b>Tip</b> 60 (+/-) hearts also exhibited significantly decreased apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings provide evidence that <b>Tip</b> 60 may function in a tumor suppressor pathway(s) to maintain adult cardiomyocytes in replicative senescence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A thick <b>tip</b> foil blade was {{designed}} to reduce the <b>tip</b> leakage flow and weaken the <b>tip</b> vortexes in ducted propeller 19 A/Ka 4 - 55. The thick <b>tip</b> foil was constructed by normal extrusion of the original <b>tip</b> foil. The maximum thickness of the foil increased from 1. 64 % chord length to 7. 64 %. The commercial CFD code CFX was employed to simulate the flow field of the two ducted propellers. From the performance curves, it could be concluded that the <b>tip</b> foil thickening will not affect the thrust and torque of the ducted propeller much. The <b>tip</b> leakage vortex (TLV) in the thick <b>tip</b> foil propeller was obviously weaker than that in the original propeller. The pressure drop in TLV middle chord position decreased by 32. 8 %. In the <b>tip</b> clearance, both propellers have the <b>tip</b> clearance vortex. The {{difference is that the}} <b>tip</b> clearance vortex in the thick <b>tip</b> foil propeller could form an expansionary channel in the <b>tip</b> clearance, which made the <b>tip</b> leakage flow slow down, and hence weaken the TLV...|$|R
40|$|Experimental and {{computational}} {{studies have}} been performed to investigate the detailed distribution of convective heat transfer coefficients on the first-stage blade <b>tip</b> surface for a geometry typical of large power generation turbines (greater than 100 MW) In a previous work the numerical heat transfer results for a sharp edge blade <b>tip</b> and a radiused blade <b>tip</b> were presented.
