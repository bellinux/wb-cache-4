In this paper we present the use of Priority-based <b>Transmission</b> <b>Scheduling</b> of SVC media data to overcome link outages and reduction in channel bit rate in mobile networks. The Priority-based <b>Transmission</b> <b>Scheduling</b> framework aims {{to use the same}} transmission bit rate and the same overall buffer size as a traditionally streaming approach would require.

One basic issue here is the use of accurate interference models to drive <b>transmission</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithms. However, experimental work in this space has been limited. In this work, we use commodity WiFi hardware (specifically, 802. 11 a) for a comprehensive study on interference modeling for <b>transmission</b> <b>scheduling</b> on a mesh setup. We focus on the well-known physical interference model for its realism. We empirically build the physical interference model via a packet reception rate vs. SINR relationship using a measurement driven method. We propose use of the “graded ” version of the model where feasibility of a link is probabilistic, as opposed to using the more traditional “thresholded ” version, where feasibility is binary. We show experimentally that the graded model is significantly more accurate (80 percentile error 0. 2 vs. 0. 55 for thresholded model). However, the graded model has never been considered in algorithmic studies on <b>transmission</b> <b>scheduling.</b> Carrying on further, we develop <b>transmission</b> <b>scheduling</b> exper-iments using greedy scheduling algorithms for the evacuation model for both interference models. We also develop similar ex-periments for optimal scheduling performance for the simplified one-shot scheduling.

50|$|Each AIS station determines its own <b>transmission</b> <b>schedule</b> (slot), {{based upon}} data link traffic history and an {{awareness}} of probable future actions by other stations. A position report from one station fits into one of 2,250 time slots established every 60 seconds on each frequency. AIS stations continuously synchronize themselves to each other, to avoid overlap of slot transmissions. Slot selection by an AIS station is randomized within a defined interval and tagged with a random timeout of between 4 and 8 minutes. When a station changes its slot assignment, it announces both the new location and the timeout for that location. In this way new stations, including those stations which suddenly come within radio range close to other vessels, will always be received by those vessels.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedThis work proposes Interference Avoidance, a {{contention}} media {{access control}} protocol for optical Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) Local Area Networks (LANs). Optical CDMA is a direct sequence spread spectrum technology for multiplexing transmissions on an optical fiber. When used as the physical layer of a LAN, its throughput tends to zero at high offered load because of multiuser interference. Interference Avoidance prevents this throughput collapse of optical CDMA networks at high offered load.; An optical CDMA LAN exhibits two unique properties: non-mutually destructive interference and correlation of state. Interference Avoidance exploits these properties to reduce packet loss because of interference. It extends the Carrier Sensing mechanism to high speed, shared medium, optical networks. Interference Avoidance consists of state estimation and <b>transmission</b> <b>scheduling.</b> This work proposes algorithms for <b>transmission</b> <b>scheduling</b> and state estimation. The <b>transmission</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithms stabilize the throughput at around 30 % of the maximum at high offered load, under the assumption of perfect state estimation. Under identical conditions, throughput without <b>transmission</b> <b>scheduling</b> tends to zero. The algorithms achieve throughput within 10 % of optimal codeword scheduling algorithms. The complexity of the algorithms is linear in codeset length, enabling low complexity hardware implementation. The performance of the state estimation algorithms approaches that of perfect state estimation as the codeset length increases and weight decreases, with a low number (< 100) of estimation samples. The complexity of the algorithms is linear {{in the number of}} estimation samples, allowing for low complexity hardware implementation. This work also demonstrates the feasibility of <b>transmission</b> <b>scheduling</b> using a laboratory testbed.

50|$|CANaerospace {{sets forth}} {{a concept of}} {{managing}} the available bandwidth of a multi-drop CAN network to ensure predictable behavior for ATM and PTP communication which is called Time Triggered Bus Scheduling. Time Triggered Bus Scheduling {{is based on a}} limitation of the number of CAN messages that any node in the network may transmit within a minor time frame. The minor time frame is defined during initial system design. The maximum number of messages transmitted within one minor time frame may differ from node to node and contain growth potential if granted by system design. It is crucial to the Time Triggered Bus Scheduling concept that every node in the network adheres to its <b>transmission</b> <b>schedule</b> at all times when generating network traffic. It is neither required nor prohibited, however, that nodes in the network synchronize to other nodes concerning their message transmission order or transmission times.|$|E
50|$|CAN error frames {{may lead}} to {{unpredictable}} behavior if the bandwidth is consumed by error frames resulting from faults of the network or the nodes attached to it. Therefore, CANaerospace recommends to limit the bandwidth usage to 50% of the maximum bandwidth so that unpredictability is mitigated. While Time Triggered Bus Scheduling requires margins and does not optimize network bandwidth usage, it provides a safe and straightforward approach to build certifiable (predictable) systems. For ensuring this under fault conditions the system designer has to define the behaviour under these conditions (error frames and avoidance of priority inversion). Applying the Time Triggered Bus Scheduling concept, it may be demonstrated that a CANaerospace network behaves predictably. Shown in Figure 5 is the <b>transmission</b> <b>schedule</b> of a CANaerospace network with two nodes transmitting their messages asynchronously, in alternating order and at random times within their minor time frames (worst-case scenario). This example utilizes 50% of the maximum bandwidth.|$|E

The original protocol used a verifiable cryptographic shuffle {{to form a}} DC-net <b>transmission</b> <b>schedule</b> and distribute [...] "transmission assignments", allowing the correctness of subsequent DC-nets ciphertexts to be verified with a simple cryptographic hash check. This technique required a fresh verifiable before every DC-nets round, however, leading to high latencies. A later, more efficient scheme allows a series of DC-net rounds to proceed without intervening shuffles {{in the absence of}} disruption, but in response to a disruption event uses a shuffle to distribute anonymous accusations enabling a disruption victim to expose and prove the identity of the perpetrator. [...] Finally, more recent versions support fully verifiable DC-nets - at substantial cost in computation efficiency due to the use of public-key cryptography in the DC-net - as well as a hybrid mode that uses efficient XOR-based DC-nets in the normal case and verifiable DC-nets only upon disruption, to distribute accusations more quickly than is feasible using verifiable shuffles.|$|E

The switches in the network enforce this timing to provide tolerance of faults in, and malicious actions on the part of, the other connected equipments. However, [...] "synchronized local clocks are the fundamental prerequisite for time-triggered communication". This is because the sources of critical data will {{have to have the}} same view of time as the switch, in order that they can transmit at the correct time and the switch will see this as correct. This also requires that the sequence with which a critical transfer is scheduled has to be predictable to both source and switch.

40|$|Abstract—With the {{emergence}} of wireless sensor networks, an enabling communication technology for distributed real-time systems, we face the critical challenge of meeting the end-to-end deadlines of real-time flows. This paper presents Real-time Flow Scheduling (RFS), a novel conflict-free real-time <b>transmission</b> <b>scheduling</b> approach for periodic real-time flows in wireless sensor networks. In contrast to existing <b>transmission</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithms that ignore interference between transmissions or prevent spatial reuse within the same channel, RFS supports spatial reuse through a novel interference-aware <b>transmission</b> <b>scheduling.</b> While recent work on conflict-free <b>transmission</b> <b>scheduling</b> focused on specialized communication patterns such as queries and converge cast, RFS is designed for peer-to-peer real-time flows with arbitrary inter-flow interference. Moreover, RFS has three salient that make it particularly suitable for real-time systems: First, RFS includes a real-time schedulability analysis that accounts for interference between real-time flows. Second, RFS improves reliability by incorporating retransmissions in a flexible scheduling scheme. Finally, RFS enhances scalability by dividing the network into neighborhoods and provides real-time performance for flows crossing multiple neighborhoods through a novel application of the Release Guard protocol. RFS was evaluated through simulations based on the traces collected from an indoor wireless sensor network testbed. Compared to a traditional TDMA protocol, RFS reduces flow latencies by up to 2. 5 times, while improving the real-time capacity {{by as much as}} 3. 9 times. I...|$|R

It has been argued that the downlink scheduling method is not suitable to be applied to the uplink <b>transmission</b> <b>scheduling,</b> where simultaneous <b>transmissions</b> may result in higher throughput [16, 17]. The uplink <b>transmission</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem is more complicated and requires further consideration of additional elements to make the corresponding scheduling policies feasible [18]. The achievable throughput in such a case depends not only on the service access time, but also on the transmission powers and the corresponding users interference. In addition, multiple users can be scheduled simultaneously to transmit in the same time slot, which is a major difference from the wireline and TDMA-like scheduling schemes, making the respective scheduling processes either inapplicable or inefficient in the CDMA environment. The simple temporal fairness scheduling, where the main resource to be shared is the time, fails to provide rational fairness in this case. As a result, the throughput optimal and fair uplink <b>transmission</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem needs to jointly consider multiple factors such as access time, transmission power, channel conditions, and number of users to be scheduled at the same time.
