30|$|Although {{there was}} a general {{congruency}} between wind data, pollen load and cross-pollination, it is evident that wind data and pollen load do not solely explain the directional extent of cross-pollination and that swirling winds may have contributed to this incongruence.

However, compared to this, a <b>theoretical</b> isolation <b>distance</b> of 135 <b>m</b> is required to ensure a minimum level of cross-pollination between < 1.0 % and 0.1 %, 503 m for < 0.1 % to 0.01 % and 1.8 km for < 0.01 % to 0.001 % based on high values of cross-pollination.|$|R
