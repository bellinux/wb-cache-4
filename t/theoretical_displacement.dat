50|$|To {{develop his}} theory Hertz used his {{observation}} of elliptical Newton's rings formed upon placing a glass sphere upon a lens {{as the basis}} of assuming that the pressure exerted by the sphere follows an elliptical distribution. He used the formation of Newton's rings again while validating his theory with experiments in calculating the displacement which the sphere has into the lens. K. L. Johnson, K. Kendall and A. D. Roberts (JKR) used this theory as a basis while calculating the <b>theoretical</b> <b>displacement</b> or indentation depth in the presence of adhesion in 1971. Hertz's theory is recovered from their formulation if the adhesion of the materials is assumed to be zero. Similar to this theory, however using different assumptions, B. V. Derjaguin, V. M. Muller and Y. P. Toporov published another theory in 1975, which {{came to be known as}} the DMT theory in the research community, which also recovered Hertz's formulations under the assumption of zero adhesion. This DMT theory proved to be rather premature and needed several revisions before it came to be accepted as another material contact theory in addition to the JKR theory. Both the DMT and the JKR theories form the basis of contact mechanics upon which all transition contact models are based and used in material parameter prediction in nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy. So Hertz's research from his days as a lecturer, preceding his great work on electromagnetism, which he himself considered with his characteristic soberness to be trivial, has come down to the age of nanotechnology.|$|E

These predictions are compared to experimental data and a finite element model. The theoretical model is described by two models where the first model predicts the plate deformation and the second model, using the deformation from the first, predict the strains in the plate. The first model or <b>theoretical</b> <b>displacement</b> model {{presents a}} stepwise velocity field approach, {{in which it is}} assumed that the explosive burns as a set of discretised rings spreading from the centre of the plate to the outer radius of the explosive. For each ring a velocity field for the plate is developed, and after including strain rate effects, a corresponding displacement is calculated. The total final displacement is determined by summing each of the individual displacements. The predictions are compared with all experimental data and a satisfactory correlation is found for both the mid-point displacements and the final plate shape. The second model or theoretical strain model uses the final displaced shape calculated using the <b>theoretical</b> <b>displacement</b> model to determine the strain in the deformed plates, with results being compared to uniaxial tensile strain and mean cap diameters obtained from experimentation.

40|$|Two {{improved}} {{analytical methods}} of calculations for natural frequencies and mode shapes of a uniform cantilever beam carrying a tip-mass under base excitation are presented based on forced vibration {{theory and the}} method of separation of variables, respectively. The cantilever model is simplified in detail by replacing the tip-mass with an equivalent inertial force and inertial moment acting at the free end of the cantilever based on D’Alembert’s principle. The concentrated equivalent inertial force and inertial moment are further represented as distributed loads using Dirac Delta Function. In this case, some typical natural frequencies and mode shapes of the cantilever model are calculated by the improved and unimproved analytical methods. The comparing results show that, after improvement, these two methods are in extremely good agreement with each other even the offset distance between the gravity center of the tip-mass and the attachment point is large.

Due to the complex behavior of the material, first a solution algorithm for the isotropic case is analyzed, then the procedure is extended to solving the more complex problem. In {{the first part of}} the work, the simplified Smith–Schajer solution to the through-hole problem for an orthotropic material is analyzed, showing that the same linear least square approach used in the isotropic case applies to a large set of orthotropic materials; based on this analysis a simple residual stress measurement algorithm is developed using either analytical or numerically estimated calibration coefficients. In the second part of the work, the general solution is discussed: since in this case the simplified Smith–Schajer solution cannot be used, the Lekhnitskii’s analysis of the through-hole plate in tension is introduced and extended to handle residual stresses. On this basis a solution algorithm using the nonlinear fit of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>displacement</b> field capable of treating all the orthotropic materials at the cost of a more complex numerical procedure is proposed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a displacement based back-analysis method for {{the determination of}} rock mass modulus (E) and the horizontal in situ stress (P) perpendicular to the axis line of the tunnel excavation in hard and intact rock masses. The rock mass is assumed to respond in an isotropic and linear elastic manner. Essentially, the method is a best-fit solution of back-analysis by comparing the measured displacements near a tunnel face during excavation with those calculated using a three-dimensional finite element method. The method can be applied efficiently and effectively by iterative algorithms such as direct search technique and damping least square technique.
