It {{should be noted}} that the CLEA SGVs relate to assessing chronic (long term) risks to human health and do not apply to the protection of ground workers during construction, or other potential receptors such as groundwater, buildings, plants or other ecosystems. The CLEA SGVs are not directly applicable to a site completely covered in hardstanding, as there is no direct exposure route to contaminated soils. To date, the first ten of fifty-five contaminant SGVs have been published, for the following: arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, inorganic mercury, nickel, selenium ethyl benzene, phenol and toluene. Draft SGVs for benzene, naphthalene and xylene have been produced but their publication is on hold. Toxicological data (Tox) has been published for each of these contaminants as well as for benzoapyrene, benzene, dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs, naphthalene, vinyl chloride, 1,1,2,2 <b>tetrachloroethane</b> and 1,1,1,2 <b>tetrachloroethane,</b> 1,1,1 trichloroethane, tetrachloroethene, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, trichloroethene and xylene.

40|$|Ion {{chemistry}} at {{atmospheric pressure}} is of major relevance to novel methods for the abatement of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) that employ non-thermal plasmas. For this reason, positive and negative APCI (atmospheric pressure chemical ionization) mass spectra of all six di-, tri- and <b>tetrachloroethanes</b> diluted in air (500 - 1500 ppm) at atmospheric pressure were investigated at 30 °C and at 300 °C. Spectral changes due to collisional activation of the ions achieved by increasing δV, the potential difference between sampling and skimmer cones, are informative of structures and ion-molecule reactions. Positive ion chemistry of the chloroethanes (M) can, in general, be ascribed to C-C and C-Cl cleavages of the molecular ion, M+•, never detected but likely formed via exothermic charge exchange from primary ions of the APCI plasma. Exceptions to this characteristic pattern were observed for 1, 1 -dichloroethane and 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane, which give [M - H]+ and [M - HCl]+• species, respectively. It is suggested that both such species are due to ionization via hydride transfer. Upon increasing δV, the [M - HCl]+• ion formed from 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane undergoes the same fragmentation and ion-molecule reactions previously reported for trichloroethene. A nucleophilic reaction of water within the [C 2 H 4 Cl+](H 2 O) n ionic complexes to displace HCl is postulated {{to account for the}} [C 2 H 5 O+](H 2 O) m species observed in the positive APCI spectra of the dichloroethanes. Negative ion spectra are, for all investigated chloroethanes, dominated by Cl- and its ion-neutral complexes with one, two and, in some cases, three molecules of the neutral precursor and/or water. Another common feature is the formation of species (X-) (M) n where X- is a background ion of the APCI plasma, namely O 2 -,O 3 - and, in some cases, (NO) 2 -. Peculiar to 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane are species attributed to Cl- complexes with phosgene, (Cl-) (Cl 2 C=O) n(n = 1, 2). Such complexes, which were not observed for either the isomeric 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane or for the <b>tetrachloroethanes,</b> are of interest as oxidation intermediates in the corona-induced decomposition process.

The rates of acetylation and degradation of cellulose using different catalyst concentrations were studied. By acetylating cellulose, using various acetylation mixtures including zinc chloride as catalyst and ether as a non-solvent, the acetylation and degradetion mechanism for cellulose was postulated. From preliminary experiments, petroleum ether as a precipitant and chloroform-acetone as a mixed solvent were selected for the fractionation of cellulose triacetate. Six fractions were obtained by a fractional precipitation methods from the osmotic pressure measurements carried out on the various fractions in chloroform using a rapid dynamic method, the molecular weight of each fraction was determined. It was shown that virtual non-fractionability of cellulose triacetate with regard to molecular weight occurred in this system. Non-fractionability is explained on the hypothesis of a polymer-solvent interaction involving hydrogen bond formation. Non-fractionability was also observed in attempts to fraction ate it from acetic acid and <b>tetrachloroethane</b> solutions. From osmotic pressure data, the Flory-Huggins' interaction parameter, chi, for the cellulose triacetate/chloroform system was evaluated.

These data with the data available in the literature on the molar excess enthalpies (H-E), molar excess Gibbs energies (G(E)), activity coefficients at infinite dilution, gamma(infinity) (i), liquid-vapour equilibria (LVE) and liquid-liquid equilibria (LLE) for dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) +n-alkanes, cyclohexane, benzene or alkylbenzenes (mono-, dialkyl-and trialkyl-) or tetrachloromethane, trichloromethane, dichloromethane and monochloroalkanes are treated in the framework of DISQUAC, an extended quasi-chemical group contribution theory. The systems are characterized by three types of contact surfaces: sulfoxide (S = O group), aliphatic (CH 3, CH 2, CH groups), cycloaliphatic (c-CH 2 group), aromatic (C 6 H 6, C 6 H 5 groups) and chlorine (C 1 group). Using a set of adjusted contact interchange energies parameters, structure dependent, the model provides a fairly consistent description of the thermodynamic properties as a function of concentration. The model may serve to predict missing data. ...|$|E
40|$|Female Cb mice {{weighing}} 20 - 23 g {{were exposed}} to 800 ppm (in average) of 1, I, 2, 2. <b>tetrachloroethane</b> for 3 hours. Both triglyceride and phospholipid in the liver and plasma were determined at varying times after the exposure. On the other hand, there were observed the ultraviolet absorption spectra of microwmallipids in the liver at 90 minutes after the 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane or the carbon tetrachloride exposure. The results thus obtained are summarized as follows: 1. The increase of hepatic triglyceride contents attained the maximum level in the period between 20 and 25 hours after the exposure and declined to the initial levels at 90 hours later. 2. The plasma triglyceride levels decreased until 25 hours after the exposure, then tended to increase significantly and were {{much higher than the}} control levels in the period between 70 and 90 hours later. 3. Both liver and plasma phospholipid levels decreased gradually up to 25 hours after the exposure, then slowly recovered with almost the same rate of increase. 4. It was suggested that the inhalation of the above vapors induced a little change in microsomal lipids in the liver. </p...|$|E
40|$|We employ dielectricspectroscopy and {{molecular}} dynamic simulations {{to investigate the}} dipolar dynamics in the orientationally disordered solid phase of (1, 1, 2, 2) <b>tetrachloroethane.</b> Three distinct orientational dynamics are observed as separate dielectric loss features, all characterized by a simply activated temperature dependence. The slower process, associated to a glassytransition at 156 ± 1 K, corresponds to a cooperative motion by which each molecule rotates by 180 ° around the molecular symmetry axis through an intermediate state in which the symmetry axis is oriented roughly orthogonally to the initial and final states. Of the other two dipolar relaxations, the intermediate one is the Johari-Goldstein precursor relaxation of the cooperative dynamics, while the fastest process corresponds to an orientational fluctuation of single molecules into a higher-energy orientation. The Kirkwood correlation factor of the cooperative relaxation is {{of the order of}} one tenth, indicating that the molecular dipoles maintain on average a strong antiparallel alignment during their collective motion. These findings show that the combination of dielectricspectroscopy {{and molecular}} simulations allows studying in great detail the orientational dynamics in molecular solids.

40|$|Many {{experiments}} for {{the behavior}} of aluminum on various organic polychlorocompound such as carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, <b>tetrachloroethane</b> and pentachloroethane hither-to {{have been carried out}} in the authors 2 ̆ 7 laboratory. In this paper, using benzyl chlorid or bromide as monohalogenoaryl the reaction between 14 sorts of metals and them are studied, and the following results are summarized. (1) In most metals benzyl bromide are more reactive than benzyl chloride and these facts are considered to be ascrbed to carbon-halogen bond strength (bond distance and bond stretching force). (2) The mitiation temperature of reaction {{may be related to the}} electrosolution voltage of respective metal and the metals having the marked reactivity are Fe for benzyl chloride and Fe, Cd, Cr, Zn, for benzyl bromide. (3) When a small amount of one metal is added to the other, the reactivity of the mixture is considerably retarded or promoted. (4) From the determination of evolution rate of HX and the effects of the electrosolution voltage or ligroin added as the nonpolar solvent on these reactions, the rreaction mechanism is prsumed to be the ionization of the metals accompanying dehalogenation of benzyl halides in the first stage and Friedel-Crafts dehydrohalogenation in the second. 首題に属する研究としては従来浅間等が四塩化炭素と金属アルミニウムとの反応について多数の報告などを行って来ているし，更に未発表の研究としてトリクロロエチレンや四塩化エタンや五塩化エタンと金属との反応を行っているが，ここでは多ハロゲン化炭化水素でないモノハロゲン化アルキルやモノハロゲン化アリルと金属との反応について種々行ったうちで割に実験結果の整理し易い副題の研究について報告するものである...|$|E
