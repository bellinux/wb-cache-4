5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E

5|$|Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea {{considered}} for {{the third and fourth}} episodes of the fourth series. It was based upon the notion of 'faces' which people used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in patterned wallpaper. While redecorating, one of the Bannerman Road gang was to strip some paint off a wall and reveal old wallpaper underneath. Faces would appear on the wallpaper; these would be aliens from another dimension trying to arrive on Earth, literally taking shape in walls and stepping through. It was noted that this notion could be adapted for patterns in wooden floors and doors.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Alfonso Cuarón had a {{predilection for}} space {{programs}} {{and dreamed of}} becoming an astronaut and would watch live moon landings in television. He was 8 years old when Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969 and was profoundly influenced by Neil Armstrong. At that time his grandmother bought a new color TV in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the moon landing that was in black and white. He watched space films like A Trip to the Moon (1902) and was further drawn to films featuring the technology of space exploration, and trying to honor {{the laws of physics}} such as Marooned (1969) and Woman in the Moon (1929). After Cuarón and his son, Jonás finished the screenplay, Cuarón attempted to develop his project at Universal Pictures, where it stayed in development for several years.

25|$|Most fish, {{reptiles}} and amphibians {{undergo a}} limited physiological colour change {{in response to a}} change in environment. This type of camouflage, known as background adaptation, most commonly appears as a slight darkening or lightening of skin tone to approximately mimic the hue of the immediate environment. It has been demonstrated that the background adaptation process is vision-dependent (it appears the animal needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the environment to adapt to it), and that melanin translocation in melanophores is the major factor in colour change. Some animals, such as chameleons and anoles, have a highly developed background adaptation response capable of generating a number of different colours very rapidly. They have adapted the capability to change colour in response to temperature, mood, stress levels, and social cues, rather than to simply mimic their environment.|$|E

Meanwhile they are useful in neutralizing the innate spirit of rebellion of young people. The term 'protest song' is no longer valid because it is ambiguous and has been misused.
